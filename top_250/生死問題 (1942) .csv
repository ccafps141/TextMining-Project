0,17 April 2019,TheLittleSongbird,10, A question of taste,"A number of interest points here. A brilliant premise. Material that was daring at the time, that one is amazed at what it got away with even if some of it may be an acquired taste. That it was the final film of the lovely Carole Lombard, who died far too young in a plane crash not long after with much more to give. And that it was directed by Ernst Lubitsch, a personal favourite of mine who had one of the most distinctive directing styles for any director often cited as ""the Lubtisch touch"".",/

2,27 December 2018,littlemartinarocena,10, An Immortal Comedy,"I'm not sure how many time I've seen it but it doesn't matter. Every time is like the first time. Carole Lombard in her last film before her untimely death is not just beautiful and impossibly funny but modern, profoundly modern. A performance that will still be relevant a hundred years from now. Jack Benny is perfect in what must be his very best film. Robert Stack, beautifully wooden, as usual, reports to duty with a delicious Lubitsch touch. As if all this wasn't enough, this film was made in 1942 and that in itself will give film lovers and historians a lot to tal;k about for centuries to come.",e
3,25 June 2019,ElMaruecan82,8," Fiction can make fun of reality, that's the revenge of reason over barbarity...","""To Be or Not To Be"" doesn't trivialize the barbarity of the Nazi regime as much as it ennobles art and gives an aura of metaphysical importance to laughter, as the main characteristic of the reasonable person. It's precisely because Ernst Lubitsch could laugh at the Nazism that one shouldn't underestimate the sadness and terror that devoured his soul. One could say the same about Chaplin's ""Great Dictator"", more focused on the inner heroism of the little people while Lubitsch' movie is a love letter to artists, and the work of a true one.",v

6,4 June 2017,howard.schumann,9, Skewers the Nazi cause as effectively as Casablanca,"In celebrating the 75th anniversary of the release of Casablanca, it is easy to overlook another anti-Nazi film, Ernst Lubitsch's ""screwball"" comedy To Be or Not To Be, a film that skewered the Nazi cause with equal effectiveness. While not as dramatic or filled with memorable lines and patriotic songs, To Be or Not To Be, like Casablanca, the film features two main Hollywood stars, Carole Lombard and Jack Benny and a love triangle in which romance must be subordinate to a greater cause. Set in Poland just before the German invasion of September 1, 1939, the film opens as a mustachioed man bearing a close resemblance to German Chancellor Adolf Hitler is seen walking alone in the streets of Warsaw.",w
7,20 November 2005,Balthazar-5,10, One of the great romantic/satirical comedies of all time,"There is a famous review of this film by the late Sunday Times critic, Dilys Powell which begins 'Is the joke funny?'... what Miss Powell was getting at was that, given the horror of the Holocaust, it is appropriate to laugh at the Nazis. The answer is, ultimately, irrelevant to the viewing of this modest masterpiece.",/
8,18 April 2018,classicsoncall,7," ""Wait a minute. I'll decide with whom my wife is gonna have dinner and who she's gonna kill!""","I was genuinely shocked when the movie began to see Jack Benny in a Nazi uniform and thought how inappropriate that casting decision was, right until it was revealed he was taking part in a documentary on Nazi Germany. So with a sigh of relief, I settled back to enjoy this humorous treatment with Carole Lombard portraying Benny's wife as the couple, Joseph and Maria Tura, became part of the Polish underground in 1939 Warsaw, right on the brink of World War II. I always wonder how films like this might have been received by audiences of the time, realizing that war was imminent, and whether or not the viewing public had reservations about seeing a film treating such a serious topic with humor. In director Ernst Lubitsch's case, he handled the issue with a unique balance of political satire, romance, slapstick and wartime suspense, and if anything, the picture might be even better received today than back in the era in which it was made.",r
9,12 November 2005,theowinthrop,10, Swan Song in Warsaw,"In 1940 the American public was shocked when Charlie Chaplin released his first all talkie movie THE GREAT DICTATOR, in which he lampooned Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Despite the new European war, we were yet still at peace with both Axis states. Hollywood, with rare exceptions (BLOCKADE, CONFESSIONS OF A NAZI SPY, ESCAPE) had been gingerly tackling the Nazis and Fascists. Yet public reaction to THE GREAT DICTATOR was odd. It had a big box office success, and yet many were appalled because it chose to say Hitler could be laughed at. Chaplin's response was that if he had been laughed at to begin with he would never have become such a threat.",w
10,6 August 2011,Steffi_P,10," ""In the hands of a ham""","It has long been controversial to make a comedy out of war and tragedy, but often it is among the best ways of dealing with a difficult subject. Being able to satirize evil and imagine humour even in the most desperate of plights is a big part of coming to terms with these things. And when done in the right way, it can make some of the most compelling works that cinema has to offer. With To Be or Not to Be, director Ernst Lubitsch, who had spent most of his career making sophisticated and often innuendo-laden comedies with absolutely no political content, surprised everyone by tackling the most urgent of topical issues head-on, yet still maintaining the frivolous comedy style that was his forte.",0
11,11 November 2005,jotix100,8, Playing Hamlet in Poland,"Having seen most of Ernst Lubitsch American films, we had missed this one because it's not played often these days. ""To Be, or not to Be"" is a wonderful satire that only a director like Lubitsch, with his European background could have pulled. The film is a good comedy that seems to has kept some of its freshness intact.",9
12,28 January 2011,bkoganbing,8," That Is The Question, Lubitsch Or Brooks?","One of the very few people who would think to remake an Ernst Lubitsch picture would be Mel Brooks who satirized just about every genre there was in Hollywood. But I doubt that Jack Benny, Carole Lombard and Robert Stack would have lent themselves to the slapstick type film that Brooks turned To Be Or Not To Be into and Mel's version is very funny.",7
13,1 February 2020,HotToastyRag,10, An excellent dark comedy,"To Be or Not to Be is one of those great classics that can make a fan of old movies from someone who would never normally want to watch one. My brother and sister-in-law are two examples; he'll only watch something in black-and-white if forced to, and she'll fall asleep in ten minutes during any movie that doesn't star Benedict Cumberbatch. Both of them loved this movie for the simple reason that it's fantastic.",4
14,19 February 2019,gbill-74877,8," Ah, Lubitsch","Only Ernst Lubitsch could have balanced all of the aspects of this film and had it come out right. He satirizes the Nazis without diminishing the evil they represented, delivers a comedy amidst the light drama of a resistance movement, and adds a little element of romance besides. The timing for the film was extraordinary; while it was being shot America had not yet entered the war, and before it was released, Carole Lombard had tragically died at age 33. The film opens a troupe of Polish actors rehearsing a play satirizing the Nazis in August, 1939, a month before the invasion, and it was highly topical at the time.",2
15,29 December 2018,Lejink,8," Benny good, man!","This is a quite brilliant Ernst Lubitsch film which manages to skilfully combine wartime dramatic pathos with wonderfully barbed humour, without doing so in an overtly propaganda-laden way. Set in Warsaw, just before and then during the initial German occupation which itself triggered World War 2, it starts in a relatively light-hearted manner as we're introduced to an acting troupe headed by husband and wife team Jack Benny and Carole Lombard, he the hammish, self-confident leading man, she the toy-boy-chasing leading lady. When the group's latest production, topically called ""Gestapo"" is closed down for fear of reprisals by the fearful authorities, they and their company join the local resistance. Amongst the rest of the cast are two spear-carrying extras who each dream of bigger parts, one who recites Shylock's ""If you prick me do I not bleed"" speech any chance he can, the other convinced he could pass for Hitler to the general public. When these foibles are adroitly woven into the plot at a climactic stage later in the film you appreciate how well written and crafted the movie is.",3
16,15 August 2003,IamWilliamBlake,9, A controversial classic that was actually made in 1941,"This movie was made before while the US was still playin' both ends against the middle.  Makin' huge profits while staying ""neutral"" The film was not allowed to be released until after, the US entered the war. ",4
17,18 March 2006,planktonrules,9, Excellent propaganda comedy,"During and just before WWII, there were a lot of propaganda films created by Hollywood to drum up morale in our fight against Fascism. Nearly all of them were deadly serious war films. And, while many of them were great, after a while they all tended to blend together. Because of this, TO BE OR NOT TO BE is a real standout picture. The movie is a comedy and yet is every bit as effective in inspiring the war effort. Now it's not surprising that the film is so well-made as its director is Ernst Lubitsch and he is ably supported by lots of wonderful character actors such as Felix Bressart and Sig Rumand (among others). However, the nice surprise about the movie was the acting of Jack Benny in the starring role (along with the wonderful Carole Lombard). For years, Benny made fun of his acting and the movies he made, but he was great and the film was great. Aside from the rather dopey HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT, in fact, I really like the few films he made.",/

19,5 February 2020,Horst_In_Translation,6," Starts really great, stays solid","""To Be or Not to Be"" is an American black-and-white film from 1942, so almost 80 years old, that runs for almost 100 minutes and was directed by Ernst Lubitsch. It was nominated for one Oscar for its music and I must admit I did not find the soundtrack too memorable, but then again there is a saying that the best soundtrack is the one that does not distract any attention away from all the other components of a film. This is a definite contender for Lubitsch's most famous film from his days in Hollywood, even if other works by him attracted more Oscar attention. But the number of votes and also the really high rating are fairly telling. So not a bad choice if you want to start getting into Lubitsch's works. The most tragic thing about this film here is probably linked to the lead actress. Carole Lombard died in a plane accident before the film as released and she was only 30. She is perhaps the biggest star from the cast, but I am not an expert on American films from the 30s, just my perception. This is obviously from the days of World War II and while Lubitsch also made films during these dark times that had no connection with this war at all (because they were set earlier), this one here is all about it. There are even many references to Hitler, but also to other aspects inevitably connected to back then, like concentration camps, and it took a special set of skills really to take aspects like these and turn them into genuinely funny moment, like one character's nickname. Like I wrote in the title of my review, I thought this began really funny and if I only talkj about those moments that take place before the invasion, I may have given the film an even higher rating. Downright hilarious there with the repeated joke that one character leaves the audience when the words ""To Be or Not to Be"" (thus the title reference) are spoken and how the actor (the actor's actor) cannot deal with what he considers rejection, even if the actual rejection happens to come from his wife as he then does not know (yet). There are other really funny moments in this part and I want to say that, even if Lombard is good as well, the best performance comes from Jack Benny, not only because all the transformations (he is a true chameleon), but his face expressions were also downright funny every time, especially when he was on stage. And I also liked howw they made fun of him being a rather hammy actor. Which Hammy certainly was not, just his character maybe, that is also how he gets exposed, but I will get to that later. So big thumbs-up for Hammy, who reminded me a bit of a mix between Mark Ruffalo and the young Bruno Ganz here and there physically.",r
20,9 April 2006,krorie,10, Jack Benny as Hamlet,"This is one of the great movie farces of all time. I would rank it very close to my all time favorite ""Dr. Strangelove."" There are several tiers of interpretation as is true of any noteworthy satire. It is not only poking fun at the stupidity and vanity of Nazism, but at aggressive war in general. Referring to Joseph Tura (Jack Benny) playing Hamlet on stage, Colonel Ehrhardt (Sig Ruman) states, ""What he did to Shakespeare we are doing to Poland."" Only someone with the comic genius of Ernst Lubitsch could compare the Thespian rape of Shakespeare with the physical rape of a country and make it work.",e

22,11 October 2015,AAdaSC,8, Encore!,"Husband and wife Carole Lombard (Maria) and Jack Benny (Joseph) are the leading lights in a Polish Theatre Company during the outbreak of World War 2. They are currently performing ""Hamlet"" and soldier Robert Stack (Sobinski), who is obsessed with Lombard and attends all her performances, is there in the audience on every occasion. Lombard and Stack arrange meetings with a pre-determined code. When Benny gives his ""To be or Not to Be"" soliloquy, that is Stack's cue to get up and leave and go backstage, much to Benny's outrage at someone getting up and leaving during his finest moment! When traitor Stanley Ridges (Professor Siletsky) passes through Poland on his way to deliver a list of names of Polish Resistance members to Hitler, the actors jump into action to prevent him reaching Germany with the list. Can they get away with their daring charades? ",_
23,27 November 2006,bandw,6, A dissenting opinion,"This movie about a company of Polish actors during the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 does have laughs (Hitler's ""Heil myself!"") and it is intricately and cleverly plotted and plays well as an intrigue. But I had a hard time with the mixing of comedy within the context of a real setting. One minute we are witnessing an air raid on Warsaw and the next we have Carol Lombard imagining what a triumph it would be to play the role of a concentration camp victim wearing an elegant dress. Maybe that was meant to illustrate the dominance of personal ego even in the face of tragedy, but the mood shifts were too much for me.",=

29,1 August 2006,EUyeshima,10, Luminous Lombard and a Never-Better Benny Light Up Lubitsch's Classic Nazi Satire,"There is a certain sense of melancholy I feel when I watch this 1942 classic Ernst Lubitsch movie, as it represents the last appearance of the luminous Carole Lombard, surely the most breathtaking and high-spirited of actresses during Hollywood's golden era. In a rush to get home to husband Clark Gable after a successful war bond tour, she died in a plane crash during the film's post-production, and as the result proves without a doubt, the world lost one of the great treasures of the silver screen. She and co-star Jack Benny play Maria and Joseph Tura, the egocentric stars of a Polish acting troupe who are caught in the 1939 Nazi invasion of Warsaw. As a world-class flirt, she is carrying on with a handsome young pilot named Stanislav Sobinski, and their trysts begin once he hears his cue to get up from his theater seat, Hamlet's famous opening line to his soliloquy as spoken by an increasingly perturbed Joseph.",v
30,1 October 1999,gazzo-2,8," You've heard of that Great, Great actor....","Terrific movie! The opening gag with 'Hitler' walking out into the street is a scream. Tense, funny, satiric, suspenseful; with some of the better bombastic teutonic actors in the business at the time: Lionel Atwill, Sig Rumann, etc. Much fun! Love seeing 'Unsolved Mysteries' Man there at age 24 or so, as a leading man type. (Lord-Robert Stack's almost 10 years Younger than me in that film...) You also get to see how good Carole Lombard was, and it's sad she was dead before the movie was out.",

32,6 March 2005,david-1764,10, A gem of a picture!,"This comedy excels due to witty dialog and superior direction. Set against the backdrop of Hitler's invasion of Poland, due acknowledgment is made of the tragedy of that event. This was a wartime picture, after all. But the satire serves as a perfect antidote, and ""To Be or Not To Be"" is simultaneously funny and sharp. Right after I watched this movie, I wanted to watch it again--it was that entertaining. The stars and character actors were all superb. Having Jack Benny play the lead was an inspired casting choice. Felix Bressart and Tom Dugan as Greenberg and Bronski, sort of the Rosencranz and Gildenstern of this movie, are hilarious. If you have not yet seen this movie, rent or buy it and treat yourself to a real gem!",
33,6 September 2002,smatysia,9, Delightfully droll,"Not exactly hilarious, but more delightfully droll and witty. Carole Lombard was just amazing. Her beauty and charm were, I'm sure, mourned deeply when lost so early. Most of the humor here was lampooning the Nazis. As someone else mentioned, it's one thing to mock Hitler and his ideology in the 1980's, and quite another to do so in 1942, when the outcome of the war was in serious doubt. Grade: A+",

35,6 September 2005,evanston_dad,8, Strange But Delightful,"It's hard to recognize how utterly daring this film probably was at the time of its release. Charles Chaplin was put on a death list by Hitler for lampooning him in ""The Great Dictator"" in 1940, and while Ernst Lubitsch's film isn't quite as scathing as Chaplin's, I still have to think that so openly mocking the Gestapo while the war was still raging took a lot of guts for everyone involved.",
36,6 November 2014,SimonJack,10, A classic war-time spoof of Nazi Germany,"""To Be or Not to Be"" is one of a very small number of films that are genuine satire. Of course, satire is comedy and humor. But it can also be dramatic, action-filled, pathos, empathy and mystery or intrigue. It is most often a combination of these. The comedy is often the release or relief from what the story would be without it. The genius of comedy- satire is its ability to make audiences laugh by its treatment of a subject that most often is not otherwise very funny. Satire can cover any and all aspects of life, but the very best – and that with unquestionably wide appeal – is political satire. That's what we have in ""To Be or Not to Be.""",
37,30 April 2020,LeonardKniffel,8, The Best Jack Benny Movie,"Remarkable as it is, this comedy about an acting troupe that becomes embroiled in a Polish soldier's efforts to track down a German spy was released in 1942 but filmed in 1941, before the USA entered World War II. The spy has information that would be damaging to the Polish resistance and the troupe must prevent its being delivered to the Germans. Set in Nazi-occupied Poland, the film stars Jack Benny and Carole Lombard, and it is difficult to imagine how they managed to pull it off, but critics continue to site this film as one of the best mockeries of the Nazis ever done. Lombard died in a plane crash along with her mother and twenty others returning from a war bond rally before the film was released. A 1963 remake of the film, directed by and starring Mel Brooks in the Jack Benny role, has always left me wondering why it was necessary to remake a film that was about as good as it was ever going to be the first time around.",

In fact, I'd almost wager that the comedies produced during the war are some of the most poignant films I've ever seen on the subject.

41,18 April 2007,writers_reign,8, A Fellow Of Infinite Jest ...,"... as Shakespeare didn't say of Ernst Lubitsch but may very well have had he lived in the 20th century. This was one of his last films and one of an unbroken string of 'classics' including Bluebeard's Eighth Wife, Ninotchka and Heaven Can Wait. At least one person writing about To Be Or Not To Be here wondered in print if Billy Wilder had a hand in the screenplay; whilst it's easy to see why someone might think that the answer is no - Wilder, of course, co-wrote the screenplays for both Bluebeard's Eighth Wife and Nonotchka - though the whole premise of the movie is very Wilderian, a Black Comedy about the rape of Poland by the Nazis actually shot whilst the violation was taking place, as good a definition of inflagrante delicto as any I know of, this is compounded by the rape of Shakespeare by a ham actor, Jozef Tura a dream part for Jack Benny who was a better actor than he was given credit for having for years played on radio (and later television) a character light years away from his real persona. Just as Wilder would do in his own films - The Apartment, for example - Lubitsch switches effortlessly between laugh-out-loud comedy and the real drama of a nation under siege and having selected a consummate group of actors from top-billed Carole Lombard to the cream of supporting players such as Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart, Stanley Ridges he got the very best out of them and even Robert Stack in a thankless under-developed role wasn't a total loss. A brilliant comedy that still stands up today.",
42,22 January 2022,I_Ailurophile,9," Smart, superb, funny classic","There are only two things to do with fascists, and though the alternative is more assuredly permanent, mocking them into oblivion is a fine choice. Gratifyingly, the latter is the path chosen in 'To be or not to be,' as Nazis are turned into a laughing stock with a stupendous screenplay, and with Ernst Lubitsch's dependably impeccable direction. The dialogue is outstandingly sharp and clever, and characters vivid and lively. Scene writing and the overall narrative alike are as carefully penned as they are brilliantly realized, entertaining and engaging through and through. And the cast is most excellent from top to bottom, bringing their roles to life with wonderful personality, range, and nuance - yet bent all the while toward the picture's slick amalgamation of wartime spying and provocative comedy. At one turn or another the picture may emphasize dire violence and destruction, espionage thrills, or robust humor - or sometimes a combination thereof - yet it's all rolled together so well that the result feels extraordinarily balanced as a whole, and fabulously enjoyable.",

It wasn't bad - some quite funny bits, likeable, never boring, but nothing outstanding, except perhaps in the subject matter. I've been watching a few Lubitsch movies recently and I ended up watching this one within a few days of watching Shop Around the Corner.  I was struck by how much sharper and wittier ""Shop"" (which I felt was everything it was cracked up to be) was in comparison to To Be or Not To Be.  Benny's character was a little too buffoonish, Lombard's character was a little too boring (though the first scene between Ehrhardt and the false Siletsky was excellent).  Unfortunately, this film was just a little too over-the-top, silly, and conveniently plotted, without ever tapping into the fun of a real screwball comedy. Oh well...",

Lubitsch made Nazis bite the dust in a pacifist manner by showing them as ridiculous souls.Although the film is comic in nature there is no denial of its serious tone.There are various serious themes like World War II, relationship between a husband and a wife,behavior of actors,horrors of war which merit viewers' attention.It is true that this film suffers from a complete lack of ""Lubitsch"" touch but comic elements make for its absence.If you happen to be one of those viewers interested in theater especially Shakespeare and his famous plays, it would be tough for you to tolerate those people who walk out during performances based on this famous bard's plays.The hidden highlight of the film is arrogant behavior of certain actors who find it hard to believe that some people might not have heard of them. It is better to tell them that in life as in plays everything is possible.",

Most of the rest of the actors don't do anything particularly special, except for maybe Robert Stack. ",
54,15 September 2011,jboothmillard,8, To Be or Not to Be,"I remembered the title obviously because of the William Shakespeare soliloquy, and that it featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but I didn't know anything about it being a comedy or war film, I was watching though with it being five stars out of five. Basically, set in World War II, we look at the occupants of a Polish theatre company while the country is invaded by the Nazi Germans, and particularly the antics of ""great great"" actor Joseph Tura (Jack Benny) and his actress wife Maria Tura (Carole Lombard, in her last film). The film has an odd opening with Adolf Hitler in the middle of Warsaw, but it is actually actor Bronski (Tom Dugan) proving his fellow actors that his resemblance to the real Hitler is uncanny, but a little girl recognises him and asks for his autograph. Then we see the production company putting on Shakespeare's Hamlet, with Bronski saying with his friend and colleague Greenberg (Felix Bressart) that he wants a starring role, i.e. ""carry the spear"", and Greenberg says he'd love to play Shylock. Then we see Maria getting a bouquet of flowers from young pilot Lieut. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack), and the arrange to meet when her husband Joseph is one stage as Hamlet playing the famous ""to be or not to be"" speech, and someone blatantly walking out, Maria and Sobinski begin an affair before he has to leave to join the war fight. When Sobinski gets to his Polish division for the British Royal Air Force he meets resistance leader Professor Siletsky (Stanley Ridges), but he gets suspicions when he asks the Professor to pass a message to Maria, but he has never heard of the famous actress, even living in Poland for ages. Back in Warsaw Maria herself is taken by two Nazi soldiers to Siletsky who does pass on the message, but then he wants to recruit her as a spy for the Nazis, she pretends to be interested and leaves with an excuse. Telling about what happened she gets her husband Joseph keen to do what needs to be done, killing the Professor, so when Maria returns to him she pretends to find him attractive, and members of the production company pretend to take him to Gestapo. But in fact he is taken to the theatre disguised with props and Joseph disguised as Col. Ehrhardt, hoping to get valuable Nazi information, and with his nerves he cannot help repeating the words ""so they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt?"", and the Professor realises he's been duped, but being chased he is shot himself. Now Joseph disguises himself as Siletsky with a fake beard and glasses to destroy information that must not be found, but he is unintentionally taken to the real Col. Ehrhardt (Sig Ruman) to give a report, and he smooths his way through the meeting, and manages to find out Hitler will be visiting Poland. The next day the real Siletsky's body is discovered, but Joseph does not find out before he goes for another meeting with Ehrhardt, so he placed in a room with the body, and he tries to dupe his way in making it look like the body is the one in disguise, quickly shaving his beard and putting on his spare fake one, and when he is about to escape the actors turn up to take off the other fake beard and pretend to take him to prison. Then the biggest event the actors have faced comes along, Hitler and many others are attending a play in the country, and Bronski dons his convincing Hitler moustache again and get in unnoticed, and Joseph is disguised as the head of the Führer's men. After whatever happens there Maria is ready to leave with the other actors, but Ehrhardt suddenly shows up trying to seduce her, and she is saved by his shock of seeing Bronski in his Hitler disguise, allowing her to walk out. All the actors are on Hitler's plane and easily dispose of the Nazis on board as they mindlessly obey orders from disguised Bronski to simply jump out without parachutes, they land and after the little surprise at the disguised actor they are praised as heroes, and asked what reward they want Joseph is interrupted by Maria saying ""he wants to play Hamlet"". The end of the film sees Joseph indeed playing Hamlet on stage and eyeballing Sobinski in the audience as he says the words ""to be or not to be"", as it triggered the hypnotised walk out reaction, but he instead has a new young man walk out. Also starring Lionel Atwill as Rawitch, Charles Halton as Producer Dobosh and Maude Eburne as Anna. Obviously World War II was actually going on at the time, so that is the only way they could get away with the bad taste jokes that are impossible to remake and recreate in modern time (even though a remake was tried with Mel Brooks in 1983), but it is not just the comedy that is great, the cast led by Benny and Lombard are terrific, and there is some poignancy to what is going on, a most watchable Second World War satire.

Jack Benny and Carole Lombard are great but I will always have to say my favorite person in the movie was Sig Ruman.  How he got most of the great lines over Benny, is beyond me.

It's one of the most impeccably paced films of the 1940s that hits every beat and leads down unpredictable paths. Instantly you can feel the heat of Billy Wilder's admiration for Lubitsch as they share similarities in a simple shooting style, love triangles and sardonic dialogue, and in a way To Be Or Not To Be does it better than Wilder ever managed. It's a battle of egos but they're deeply human underneath, balancing dry humour and tragedy beautifully. This is simply one of the funniest, intelligent and most poignant films of the 1940s.

It's still incredibly funny, but it's much more impressive, almost shockingly so, when you realize that it was made while Hitler was alive, and just how powerful it was back then.

Indeed, between the film's brazenly audacious topicality and the horribly tragic pre-release death of its leading lady, it almost boggles the mind to imagine any audiences chancing a viewing of Ernst Lubitsch's To Be or Not To Be, let alone laughing at it. Thankfully, the benefit of hindsight reveals a true classic waiting in the wings. Taking its place alongside Chaplin's The Great Dictator as one of the bravest (and, by proxy, funniest) films of the era, To Be or Not To Be is a savage satire and comedy of errors, wordplay, and mistaken identities worthy of Shakespeare himself, in addition to being a palpably tense and engrossing war film in its own right.

The Mel Brooks 1983 remake is not as good as the Lubitch 1942 original. A poor Jewish thespian troupe in Poland struggles to continue it's meager livelihood by producing plays, but The Nazis take over Poland and blow up the entire neighborhood. A brilliant mixture of comedy, satire, and melodrama which includes a love triangle between ""ham"" actor Josef Tura (Jack Benny) his actress wife Maria Tura (Carole Lombard) and a Polish RAF flier (Robert Stack). The classic line: ""Tura is doing on stage what Hitler is doing to Poland"". Throw in a fanatically-crazy Nazi spy, stupid, bumbling Germans and a bit of cloak-and-dagger action and you have quite a unique production. Probably the inspiration for ""Hogan's Heroes"" decades later. While the real Hitler is waiting for the play to begin, the fake Hitler causes a riot, and the entire madcap cast hijacks the ""Fuhrer's"" car and airplane and escapes to Scotland. It's both a screwball comedy and a serious comment on the Nazi menace, as it was filmed in 1941, during the war. For the full (and complicated) plot synopsis, go to TCM.com and ""Google"" the title. Jack Benny plays his finest movie role of all time and it is Carole Lombard's last film, as she died tragically two months later in an airplane crash near Las Vegas.

The entire cast is excellent as is the script, which manages to sneak some loaded innuendos past the post-code censors, and the story is complex and clever (although a few conveniences and implausibilites need be forgiven). The film was made just before the Americans entered the war and several years before the true horrors of the Nazi regime became known outside of the occupied territories; nevertheless, making a comedy about the occupation of Poland must have taken some chutzpah (similar to Chaplin's lampooning of Der Fuhrer in 1940's 'The Great Dictator'). Although the word is never used, the actor Greenberg (Felix Bressart), who dreams of playing Shylock, is clearly a Polish Jew and from a post-1945 perspective, it's a bit chilling to hear him frequently quoting Shakespeare, saying ""If you poison us, do we not die"".

98,15 March 2009,Dr_Coulardeau,8, Age does not become that film very well,"A decent little film shot in 1942. Could we say it was shot dead? Or is that too Jewish a piece of humor? The plot is absurd and that is why it is funny, but not a deep intellectual funny, nor a deep artistic and esthetic funny, nor even a deep emotional funny. Just funny for war time, funny for when everyone is crying, weeping or plain dying. We think of the other Jewish actor who did a similar impersonation of Hitler, Charlie Chaplin. But Charlie Chaplin played the real Hitler, whereas here it is always a false Hitler, tricking the real one in his back. That is funny for sure but that is also kind of vain, except if you take it is as a plain entertainment for an audience that wants to laugh at their arch enemy. So they play the Mickey out of him. But what's left after sixty or more years? Not much except the scene about ""to be or not to be"", played three times on a stage in the context of Hamlet in the film. The force of this sequence is in the fact that an actor plays Hamlet in front of an audience and a member of that audience stands up and walks out on him when he says that sentence, and the scene is of course in front of another audience, us. The second level of that distantiation is what makes it funny because we can see the varying surprise and anger of the actor who takes it as an insult before he learns it was coded language. And it is true Ehrard has it right when he says that what this Tura actor did to Shakespeare, they, the Nazis, are doing it to Poland. But then the third time, and that is only true for us, though also for one person in the audience in the theater in the film, it becomes absurd because there is no explanation for that total stranger to stand up and walk out. But apart from that the film has aged tremendously and even the acting has aged and seems so unnatural, though we can accept that from most of the main actors who are supposed to be actors and hence to play a role, even in real life. The only important thing is that in 1942 the film is heavily speaking of concentration camps. If Lubitsch knew about it, why didn't the allies know about it and why didn't they do something to stop the massacre? At least they had no excuse and they cannot pretend they were less informed than Lubitsch. That's the only interesting point of that film still today.",

106,5 May 2023,davidmvining,8, Comic thriller with the Lubitsch Touch,"It's interesting to contrast Ernst Lubitsch's effort at directly dealing with Nazism against Fritz Lang's. Lubitsch had the advantage of leaving Germany in the early 20s, well before the rise of Hitler while Lang left in 1933 right as they claimed power over the legislature and Hitler's rise to the chancellorship. Lubitsch had a certain distance to what had been going on in his home country, and he was able to thrive in his fantasy versions of Central and Western Europe for more than a decade. However with the actual involvement in the war by his adopted country, and with the rise in popularity of war pictures, Lubitsch found a way to make his own war movie. Where Lang made earnest thrillers begging America to get involved like Man Hunt, Lubitsch made a comic-thriller that poked fun at actors and Nazism in equal measure. It's just about the most Lubitsch war film he could come up with.",

Born in Berlin in 1892, Ernst Lubitsch began his film career as an actor in 1912, and writing and directing duties followed just two years later. He swiftly made a name for himself in German cinema, and, recognising the greater resources to be found in Hollywood, relocated to the United States in 1922, under contract with Mary Pickford. Talented writer Billy Wilder  also born in Germany  worked with Lubitsch on two pictures, 'Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (1938)' and 'Ninotchka (1939),' and the influence to be found in Wilder's later work is unmistakable. 'Stalag 17 (1953)' was a courageous comedy picture in its own right, approaching Nazicism and prisoners-of-war in a lighthearted fashion, but Lubitsch's 'To Have and Have Not (1942),' released at the height of World War Two, is in a completely different league of audaciousness.

130,26 May 2020,krational66,8, From passive to active,"In the early era of silent film, due to technical limitations, the sound and the picture in the movie could not be synchronized. It is for this reason that silent film entered another path of completely narrative dominated by the picture without the participation of sound. Therefore, At that time, many directors and theorists thought that the film was a pure visual art. Although the film will show off-the-shelf music for the film when it is shown in the cinema, and even later it will create music specifically for the film, but at the beginning of the sound film, it was met with opposition and resistance from countless directors and theorists.
The 1926 film ""Tang Juan"" already has a sound, but this sound is limited to some music. Only in October 1927 did the emergence of ""The King of Jazz"" mark the birth of the first true sound film in the history of cinema. The dialogue of the characters in the movie caused the audience to be captivated at that time. The ""Light of New York"" filmed later was a full dialogue. Although the plot was vulgar, it still achieved great success. By the end of 1929, almost all American urban and rural cinemas had sound installations. For a time, the number of audiences in movie theaters increased significantly. Although audio films bring a series of more real and accurate movie watching experience to the audience, the directors also worry that the appearance of sound will bring a terrible problem, that is, many movies are adapted from literary or dramatic works , Which may allow literature and drama to invade the film and replace montage performance with dialogue. Therefore, Eisenstein, Pudovkin, and Aleksandrov put forward ""sound-painting montage"" in a statement The concept of sound, that is, sound is a factor of montage, is an inevitable and effective way to express and solve complex problems.
Liu Bieqian's famous comedy ""to be or not to be"" was produced in 1942. At this time, the use of sound in the film has been quite mature. The sound is no longer used as the decoration of the film, but has become an active participant in the film, revealing the characters Inner emotion, an important expression tool to enrich the expressiveness of the work. In addition to the compact and splendid plot, this movie should be largely credited for its success in its lines and excellent use of music and sound.
First, let's analyze the character dialogue in the movie. In the early silent films, due to the lack of sound, subtitles must be used to explain the plot in some last resort. Even so, the plot of the movie should not be overly complicated, otherwise it will affect the audience's understanding, and although the subtitles can solve part of it Problem, but it takes up the time of the film, interrupting the rhythm of the picture and affecting the narrative. Therefore, the appearance of dialogue in the play is the first to solve the problem of storytelling. In addition, the expression, timbre, and tone of the actors in the dialogue are all important tools to show the character, psychology and emotions of the characters. For example, in the film, Joseph Dura often calls himself ""the greatest Polish actor"" and asks if anyone has heard of his name. What he shows here is that he is extremely confident in his performance; for example, the real one in the film Colonel Aihart, he always imposes all his mistakes on his subordinates, and uses ""who can I still believe"" to relieve responsibility, every time he sees him yelling at his subordinate's name plus his beard glaring , The audience knew what he was doing. Therefore, his personality traits are credit for letting himself lead, and fault for the subordinates. Finally, the most important role of the film in dialogue is its potentially rich content. The most classic in the film is the line in ""Hamlet"": ""to be or not to be"", which is the name of the entire movie, and in the play is the line that actor Joseph Dura often reads, This line has a black humorous technique. For example, when Joseph read this line in the theater for the first time, he saw a person stand up and leave. At that time, he showed surprise and incomprehension. He had some pauses trying to attract the attention of the person who left, and his eyes followed the figure of the person. Since then, this line has become a symbol with a special meaning, symbolizing his wife and Sobinsky The lieutenant's meeting secret code is for him a hint that others are not interested in his performance. There are also some impressive lines, such as Bronsky who played Hitler said: ""Long live myself"" This is a mockery, and it is a mockery in the play, this is the line they used to film, but it is also Liu Bieqian The mockery of Hitler. Also, when Bronsky was on the streets of Warsaw, when the little girl said to him, ""Can I sign a name? Bronsky"", it created a comedic effect because he was recognized at a glance . For another example, Ehat said to Joseph who pretended to be Silitsky: ""What he did to Shakespeare is what we are going to do to Poland now."" What Joseph was most proud of was his performance in Shakespeare's drama, but it was evaluated as his destruction of Shakespeare's drama. His sudden stiff expression made the audience unbearable. This whole movie wins with lines. Many humorous jokes are expressed in lines. Imagine if this is a silent film, then it is estimated that the audience does not understand much in many places, let alone laugh. From the silent film, it requires the audience to speculate the plot itself to later use dialogue to promote the development of plot characters, and the position of sound in the film is gradually increasing.
Secondly, the narration of this film. For example, the narration at the beginning of this film, the narration here is an objective narration. The opening was a third party's narrative of the picture's performance, describing the streets, scenes, facial expressions, movements and psychology of the audience. The audience did not understand it very well, but as the story evolved, the scene that appeared at the beginning was explained again. The role of this narration is mainly in narrative, just like others are telling a story, there is a little suspense. First of all, after the story, the reason why the opening scene will appear when you turn around, use the narration to flashback one Things, arouse the interest of the audience. The original live commentary in the movie theater was optional, but the current narration has already taken on important narrative and other aspects, and the development of voice status is evident.
In this film, the use of music is also a highlight. The first thing to mention is that after Warsaw was occupied by the German Nazis, a series of notices were posted on the screen. Along with the notice appeared a serious and cruel music, accompanied by the content of the death penalty and other notices, and under the wind The rainy weather shows that the people of Warsaw under Nazi occupation are being slaughtered and ravaged. Similarly, when Greenberg was holding a shovel in the snow while chanting Sherlock's lines, it was accompanied by miserable music. The lines were already desolate, and with the music hitting people's hearts, it also showed the depth of the Warsaw people. The Polish Air Force sang together. This is the use of sound source music in the film. The high-pitched singing reflects the young soldiers' passion for defending the country and maintaining a humorous state under war. During the parachute jump of Lieutenant Sobinsky, the music was tense and rhythmic. Sobinsky was fleeing and the Nazis were chasing. When the two sides were about to meet, the music was tense immediately. It tends to be gentle again, as if it is the kind of instantaneous relaxation and comfort that a person exhibits when he can finally breathe after a long suffocation. The most striking thing about the whole music should be the scene where Joseph found Sobinsky sleeping in his bed. The sound of music began to recall when Joseph discovered the man 's pants on the stool. At first, the music revealed a trace of doubt. Then, Joseph walked to the bed. The music revealed that he was cautious and searching, knowing to turn on the light and see the man lying on the bed. , The sound of music became shocked, Joseph quickly put his head close to the man on the bed and straightened up, and the music was changing with his movements in a high and low manner, matching Joseph 's search and suspicion to the person in front of him until he Recognizing that Sobinsky was the one who left halfway through his performance twice, the music stopped abruptly. The entire music is carried out in accordance with Joseph's psychological changes. The music is as if Joseph's externalized emotions are directly exposed to the audience. And the music used by the actors when they searched for Silitsky in the theater also created a tense atmosphere.
Finally, the use of sound in this film. Hitler, who was fake, was leaving the theater, leading a group of real Nazi officers out, in a uniform pace, following a rhythmic footstep, and following on. This is a serious and neat army, but the leader is a fake leader. The sound of clanging footsteps is ridiculous, because their closely protected object is actually a counterfeit. The officers do not know it, but the audience will look like It's funny and ironic. Another place was at Joseph 's house, when Colonel Ai Hart was about to invade Mrs. Dura, the fake Hitler rushed in again, and Mrs. Dura left with him, the door closed, we heard a gunshot, Ai I committed suicide. The gunshot just clarified this point, but it also contained other meanings. For example, Ai Hart was very afraid of Hitler. Therefore, when he learned that he had offended the head, he chose to self-discipline. This gunshot is actually both a narrative and a metaphorical meaning, ach",

143,26 May 2020,krational,8, to be or not to be,"The relationship in the age inevitably has some flaws. The relationship between the husband and wife runs through the whole. The most classic first is that the husband enters the door and finds that a strange man is amused to death in the bed. Death, the films of that era should never set an inherent impression on the protagonist, and you will be surprised later! An actress's well-known stalk, a fake beard in the play, and the bureaucratic system's pedantic, play very slippery. But Liu Bieqian touch seems to have little expression in this part.",
144,28 April 2003,muray,10, The greatest scene stealer,"""To Be Or Not To Be"" was one of the greatest films made during World War II. Jack Benny and Carole Lombard were perfectly cast, however my vote goes to the greatest scene stealer of them all, Sig Rumann, in the role of ""Zo They call me Concentration Camp Erhardt?""",
145,10 March 2021,EclecticCritic,1, Propagandistic Pig 🐷 Swill,Where to begin with this mess? The ludicrous plot? The artificial dialogue? The self-satisfied smugness? The unsuccessful attempts at wit? The insipidity? The dullness? The odd casting choices? All of the above? None of the above?,
146,12 November 2005,chasser65,10, hilarious,"hilarious!!! what a film, satire at its very very best, laughed almost from start to finish, brilliant scene where Joseph Tura is impersonating Dr Siletsky and walks into the living room of the Nazi officer to find the body of the real Siletsky lying dead in the chair!!! so cleverly done, shame they don't make them like that any more!!!! how this is not in the top 250 films is beyond me, i would advise everyone to get hold of this film and see it as soon as possible. tragically Carole Lombard died before this film was released and for me this is one of her best, so everyone who agrees with me get online and get this timeless classic back into the top 250!!!",
147,11 March 2015,doorholder,8, that is the preoccupation,"I wasn't familiar with Jack Benny going into this movie, other than his rep that said he couldn't cross over into film. I don't really see why, I thought he was quite capable and had a command of guises and disguises that weren't dissimilar from someone like Sacha Guitry. There can also be a connection made to Preston Sturges, with all the madcappery going on that still feels just as vital today. Some of the jokes could very well be inserted into an episode of The Simpsons and viewers wouldn't bat an eyelash. I loved seeing Robert Stack show up as a dippy flingy paramour. I think what impresses me most with To Be Or Not To Be is the sense of play throughout, and not just onstage. There are matters of love, life and death that are treated most often as debonair or romantic whimsy. A farce about humanity's greatest threat. IN YOUR FACE, Hitler",
148,28 February 2023,corfuisland,8, A masterpiece of classic Hollywood and a great anti-war satire,"It takes guts and endless talent to make an anti-war satire in the middle of World War IIand Ernst Lubitsch possessed both. His film, which was considered in bad taste when it was released but is now recognized as a pure masterpiece, takes place in Nazi-occupied Warsaw, where a troupe finds itself embroiled in a mission to track down a German spy. Lubitsch's handling of the balance is astonishing, with the director lending an unseen narrative fluidity to the style of the film, which begins as a witty comedy, evolves into a tense thriller, and ends as a dark comedy that mocks the absurdity of war. All this without missing the intelligent sarcasm about the actors' jealousies and their dreamy temperament, which finally manages to save them from the horror.",
149,3 October 2018,shuichik-91691,10, I had a deep emotion to meet the movie.,"I watched the movie at the age of 20.
The story of movie is elegant, humorous and precious.
But I noticed some important.
It was the things that the movie had the satire.
When i had watched the movie, i was surprised the satire.
This movie had love, drama and dispute.
I really love the movie !",

152,10 March 2019,ricatheater,10, An Incredible Achievement,"One must wonder what kind of an idiot Bosley Crowder must have been to critique this film in the way he does - you can read his review in Metascore section -
This film is an absolute classic and pleasure. It wonderfully conceived and performed. This what they meant by ""The Lubitsch Touch!""",
