0,4 February 2005,rmax304823,10, Don't Forgo Fargo,"Boy, is this a good movie. In its bare bones it is a crime drama but the Coen brothers constantly undercut the seriousness with a quirky irony. The acting, the script, and the direction lift the movie light years above most of the movies of its decade.",/
1,19 June 2021,kevin_robbins,10, I'd score this a 10/10 and is an American film masterpiece.,"Fargo (1996) is a movie I recently watched again on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a group of kidnappers executing a paid job for a scammer of sorts. As some eccentrically behaved local detectives start investigating a recent murder conducted by the previously referenced kidnappers, the entire kidnapping may get blown up. This move is directed by the amazing Coen Brothers (Raising Arizona) and stars William H. Macy (Shameless), Steve Buscemi (Reservoir Dogs), Kristin Rudrüd (Drop Dead Gorgeous), Frances McDormand (Nomadland) and John Carroll Lynch (Zodiac). The storyline for this is so interesting and contains intricate characters, sub plots and primary plot. There's so much depth in every aspect of this movie you get fascinated by every facet, and both the good and bad guys. Loved how the entire story unfolds and every aspect of this movie is satisfying. I'd score this a 10/10 and is an American all time masterpiece.",r
2,24 November 2006,ccthemovieman-1,10, The Best Effort From A Number Of People,"I didn't see this in the theater but saw it the first week it was out for rental, and have enjoyed it ever since. In fact, I probably enjoy this more each time I view it. It's a sick movie, though, make no mistake about that. However, it holds a strange fascination, probably because of the odd characters.",e
3,2 October 2005,blanche-2,10, You have no call to get snippy with me.,"I just love McDormand's face when she says that line - she takes a beat, her facial expression doesn't change, and then it comes out of her mouth like she's ordering a hamburger. Brilliant.",v
4,31 July 2015,AlsExGal,9, Another jewel from the Coens,"This movie opens with the words ""This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred."" I never challenged these words, but apparently no such incidents as depicted in this film ever occurred. The movie plays out quite believably - A middle-class car salesman gets in over his head financially by embezzling from his employer, thinking that the business deals he is making with the money will allow him to replace the stolen goods before he is detected. When his schemes don't pan out he must find a way to replace the money. The salesman's father-in-law - and employer - is wealthy but distant and indifferent towards him, so he hatches a plan to fake his wife's kidnapping with the help of two felons he doesn't know at all who are ""vouched for"" by an ex-con mechanic that works at the same dealership he works for. He figures his father-in-law will pay the ransom, he'll split it with the felons, and his problems will be solved. This is not to be the case. It turns out that these felons are more violent and uncontrollable than the salesman counted on, and they leave quite a body count in their wake. Also, in another clever twist, what becomes of the ransom money over which so many greedy people in the film have fought and died is quite ironic to say the least. Although I wouldn't exactly say we read this story in the paper everyday, we all have read something similar - someone who has lived an ordinary life for several decades suddenly gets tempted into some criminal activity that quickly escalates out of control.",i
5,13 April 2005,paul2001sw-1,7, Cold-hearted,"The Coen brothers' 'Fargo' is nearly a great film: a beautifully shot, blackly comic thriller that quietly subverts every convention of the genre. This is a film where the remote mid-western city of Minneapolis plays the same role as New York in a normal crime story, a hub of civilisation and vice; where the hero is a woman (and a heavily pregnant, happily married woman at that); and the chief villain a car salesman of absolutely no slickness whatsoever. In a final irony, most of the action doesn't even take place in Fargo, but in the even more obscure town of Brainerd. Yet I found it hard to love this film. At brief moments (in depicting the relationship of policewoman Marge, played superbly by Frances McDormaid, and her husband), it feels astonishingly tender, yet at others, it feels as if it is simply making fun of the strange folks from outer America with the wacky accents and absurdly stoical demeanour. And the combination of deadpan acting and frankly silly plot excess sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Above all else, perhaps, 'Fargo' lacks a beating heart: while nearly moving, and nearly funny, there's a part of this film that refuses to commit itself, that prefers to hold back and mock not just its subjects, but also the idea that a film should take itself seriously. The Coens are widely celebrated as among the best film-makers of our age, but watching their films, I usually end up wondering whether irony is not a slightly over-rated virtue. Fargo looks lovely, and weird, and has a wry outlook all of it's own; but it won't make you laugh out loud, or cry. If it wasn't called a masterpiece I might almost like it.",e
6,12 November 2005,Stibbert,8, Thank's a bunch for this one,Fargo is a great piece of movie. It has a strong story and a strong cast. It's down to earth and believable.,w
7,11 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, My favourite Coen brothers movie,"The Coen brothers can always be guaranteed to deliver a quirky, diverting, off-key movie experience, and FARGO remains their most successful movie to date; a story of small-town life, dead cold temperatures, and a bloody crime wave. As with the majority – if not all – of their films, it's a densely-plotted, intelligently-scripted story, with a cold grasp on reality throughout but nevertheless some absurd situations to enjoy.",/
8,31 January 2006,jotix100,10, Paul Bunyan territory,"Joel Coen the director of ""Fargo"", proves he is one of our best directors with this tale of deception and murder told in a style that takes humorous turns in the action. ""Fargo"" is one of the best American films of the nineties. Joel Coen working together with his brother, Ethan, have made pictures that will be viewed as classics, as time will tell. Their movies are always an excellent way to spend some time because they always manage to deliver, even in films that aren't popular with the public.",r
9,23 February 2021,planktonrules,8, I'm glad I gave this one a second chance.,"I saw and reviewed ""Fargo"" long ago and I decided to re-watch it tonight....and I am glad that I did. The first time I saw it, I gave it a very poor review....and this time I appreciated it much more. I think the reason, though, isn't all my fault. I think it is because the film had SO much hype....so many people saying it was brilliant that the film simply could NOT live up to all the hype. In other words, while a very good film, it certainly was hyped a LOT when it debuted and garnered a lot of attention during the Oscars. I think it also didn't help that they called it a comedy...which it really isn't.",w
10,11 April 2021,briancham1994,8, Screwball crime film,"I hesitate to call this a comedy film. I found parts of it funny but more in the way that Wes Anderson films are dainty rather than laugh-out-loud funny. The storyline features a clueless and bumbling car salesman attempting a hare-brained scheme with equally incompetent criminals, all juxtaposed a disarmingly mundane and friendly Midwest setting. The stand-out feature of this film is the acting, as the characters are all perfect depictions of those who simply cannot get anything right! I see more inspiration from old screwball films than traditional crime dramas. After a spate of Martin Scorsese films, Heat and Scarface, the easygoing style of this film was a breath of fresh air.",2
11,6 October 2009,Galina_movie_fan,10," Films like ""Fargo"" are why I love the movies, said Roger Ebert.","""Films like ""Fargo"" are why I love the movies"", said Roger Ebert. The film-makers Joel and Ethan Coen, the writing/directing team also known as Two Headed Director, are the reason why I believe in the modern movie-making. To take the story like the one Fargo is based on which has been told so many times before and, I am sure, will be told over and over again, to turn and twist it in the most in-anticipated ways, to create the characters so alive and three dimensional that you believe every word they say and every step they take, to provide them with some of the best quotes and dialogs I've ever had pleasure to hear, to mix dry humor and humanity, to make the film recognizable but uniquely beautiful, dark, dramatic, and funny - that's what Coens achieved in Fargo which has been supposedly the Best film they ever made. ",7
12,22 August 2004,jrfranklin01,2, What Did I Miss Here?!,"Okay, so I've heard of the litany of accolades this movie has received. I've heard how this film is a ""black comedy"" by the Coen Brothers, who supposedly are geniuses in the film industry. And I've listened to friends discuss how creative and wonderful the film is. But none of this, I repeat, NONE OF THIS, is apparent in this movie. What I watched was a film confused at whether to be serious or comedic. And in making up its mind, both elements are fused together in a twisted fashion with an out-of-place Canadian humor.",8
13,18 January 2023,arthur_tafero,9, Fargo - The Best Coen Brothers Film of All Time,"The Coen Brothers are famous for biting, cutting-edge satire that is both shocking and entertaining. They have made some of the finest films of the last two decades; among them are: The Big Lebowski, Brother, Where Art Thou? And Blood Simple. However, Fargo is easily the best of all others the Coens have done.",2
14,8 September 2022,filipemanuelneto,8," An excellent film, although the comedy is so watered down and so sarcastic that it's not funny to most people.","When I saw this movie for the first time, a few years ago, I didn't understand it, and it annoyed me a lot. However, I've always heard good things about it, and after seeing several Cohen films that I liked, I realized the film's potential and decided to rewatch it. I did it at a good time: the film is better than I thought, and I just didn't know how to evaluate it as it deserved.",8
15,14 February 2006,Hitchcoc,10," Well I S'pose Ya Should See It, Ya Know","Bein' a Minnesotan and havin' seen ""Fargo"" (which is not in Minnesota, ya know), I want to say that we don't talk that way. No indeedy. Well that said, this review can move on ahead. I certainly liked that Frances McDormand. You know, she was constantly on the trail of those two guys (they were funny lookin'). William Macy as Jerry certainly did a good job as the auto salesman who fell on hard luck and had to have his wife kidnapped. You betcha! And that kidnapping scene where the two guys botched it was funny in a sick kinda way, considerin' they killed her and all. Yaw! Those Coen brothers. A couple of Minnesotans, ya know, can tell a pretty gory tale and make it work out. And where else would you find a wood chipper bein' a major part of a story? This movie is certainly in my top ten of all time. I hope you get to see it or whatever!",1
16,30 April 2021,CubsandCulture,10, A delightful deconstruction of film noir,The Coen brothers' early films are all variants-usually comedic-on film noir. This is the most successful of their early efforts. In some ways it is a rather blunt in how it turns the style inside out. I.e. The negative space of typical noir is made white by setting the story in Minnesota or how basically every character is dumber than a bag of rocks. The film is highly enjoyable because of this quality. And if nothing else the film is always amusing.,3
17,17 April 2001,Keyser Soze-12,4, YEP! I AM THE ONE GUY WHO DIDN'T LIKE FARGO!,"Okay, I know I have just made more enemies than I can count.  But, I ask, what is so funny about Fargo?  Really, I never laughed through the whole movie, ever.  I have a really twisted sense of humor, but anything can make me laugh.  I loved O' Brother Where Art Thou.  I loved Happy Gilmore.  I loved Clerks.  I loved Dr. Strangelove.  I loved Blazing Saddles.  So there, I love a very diverse amount of comedies.  But I did not love Fargo.",/
18,22 January 2005,bob.gladish,9, Reflections on a second viewing,"This should stand as the Coen brothers' tour de force, although I found  ""The Big Lebowski"" to be an even more satisfying film. I look at  ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", and ""Brother, Where Art Thou?"" as being  the Coen's three best movies. I hope there is more from them in the  future that can rival these three; though recent offerings such as  ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""The Ladykillers"", could be proving their  peak creativity is behind them.  ""Fargo"" is beyond a doubt, their masterpiece. IMDb's ratings bear this  out - 8.2 for ""Fargo"", 8.0 for ""Lebowski"", and 7.8 for ""Brother"". For  sheer entertainment, ""Lebowski"" or should I call it, ""The Dude"" wins  handsdown, but ""Fargo"" has all the elements of a true classic. Beyond a  doubt, I have never seen such a dramatically-obvious portrayal of good  vs. evil, and never, never, have I seen such gut-wrenching violence.  Oh, the violence, beautifully believable, in it's grotesque way. This  movie is proof that artistic freedom to portray such violence should  never be denied. Steve Buscemi's bullet-grazed face becomes almost as  painful for the watcher as it is for his character; Steve Buscemi's leg  in the wood chipper is as horrific a scene as you are ever going to  see. Enough to give Marge Gunderson morning sickness all over again.  And the good vs evil thing: so obvious in the contrasts between Marge  (the good), Buscemi and Stormare (the evil), and poor Jerry Lundegaard  (William H. Macy) squeamishly caught in a trap in-between. I could only  handle the violence because of Marge. She is the rock of normality, who  continues trumpeting the virtuous life, when all hell is breaking loose  around her. She knows all-to-well that ""you know what"" happens, but  always knows ""you know what"" can be flushed down the toilet. Frances  McDormand, as Marge, deserves every acting award she ever got for this  role. Marge, to me, is the most perfect cop I've ever encountered. She  is polite, non-judgemental, yet able to ask the tough questions that  gets her the information she needs. You can see how thoroughly she  sizes up those she interviews: watching every nuance of their body  language, and hearing ever inflection of their speech. Now here's a  woman who can spot a lie when others can't. Unlike so many cops in  movies, she doesn't have to beat information out of someone; she can  charm it out of them, all the while appealing to their moral  responsibility, no matter how immoral they may be.This is so well-shown  in scenes such as talking to the two young hookers in the bar, and  putting Jerry on the hotseat in the car dealership interrogations.  I elected not to watch some of the scenes on my second viewing.  Somewhat oddly, I skipped almost all the scenes involving Jean  Lundegaard (the kidnapped one) - I couldn't bear to watch what was  happening to this woman, knowing full well her fate. I felt so sorry  for her; she was the true victim in this - the most innocent, yet the  one who suffered the most. I guess a case could also be made that her  son, Scotty, suffered equally, but most of what he went through was not  presented on camera. Maybe he would suffer the most, for he had to live  afterward. Even Marge would suffer from this catastrophe, but you know  her suffering will be tempered by an unwavering belief that good  triumphs over evil. As the last scene shows (Marge getting into bed  with her husband): despite the horrors that might go on around us, we  must seek solace in the everyday beauty of the things that are nearest  and dearest to us all. And this message is conveyed to us all by the  Coen brothers without any allusions to religion whatsoever. But I'm  getting into a personal bias of my own here - if you take solace in  religion playing a part in morality, so be it.",?
19,10 November 2022,bellino-angelo2014,8, Another nice outing from the Coen brothers,"While I am not really a big fan of the Coen brothers I liked most of their movies I saw, the best being THE HUDSUCKER PROXY. Having heard for years about FARGO since they made also a TV show based on it, I knew that some day I would have seen it, and I did last March. Considering that to date there are 1,087 reviews I'll be short.",r
20,11 November 2004,retroman85,10, A masterpiece of Shakesperean proportions,"I've always thought Fargo would make a great Shakesperean play; you could alter the modern elements and still have created a buzz 400 years ago in suburban England. Indeed, the plot is similar to Hamlet's, in that they both have characters we root for who create zany plans than end up spinning wildly out of control into bloodshed. Many people seem to like Fargo for its humorous qualities, its characterization of the Minnesotan culture and Frances McDormand- not me. I love Fargo for its brilliant writing, its tragic musical score, its tragic plot, William H Macy, Harve Presnell and Steve Buscemi, its ignorance of political correctness (how many movies can you remember when the only two minority characters were both revealed to be creeps).I want to draw attention to an overlooked reason why the film works so well - how well the music suits the visuals in this movie. Each murder scene is scored superbly, and other audio clues really add to the effect (for instance, notice how when the police officer asks Carl Showalter ""What's this?"" in reference to the abductee, a disquieting guitar sound is immediately played that has an instantaneous psychological effect on how you interpret the scene). I have seen this film over, well, an embarrassing number of times and have committed its screenplay, from start to finish, by memory. Fargo is the ultimate Coen Brothers movie, a brilliant tragedy, and restores my faith in Roger Ebert as he places this movie in as his fourth favorite movie of the '90s.",e
21,18 May 2014,SnoopyStyle,9, Coen brothers' black comedy masterpiece,The Coen brothers flash the based on true story disclaimer for a real 1987 Minnesota incident. It's one of the misdirections. Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) hires two bumbling criminals Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife and force his hard father-in-law Wade Gustafson to pay the ransom. Jerry is miserable working for Wade in his car dealership and he's in desperate need for cash. The kidnapping goes horribly wrong when more people get killed including a police officer. Pregnant sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) goes to investigate.,f

23,8 July 2001,moonspinner55,6," Excellent acting, but smugness hangs over the whole thing like a frosty pall","Minnesota car-dealer arranges to have his wife kidnapped in order to get his hands on his father-in-law's money, but the plan goes awry. Another blood-soaked black comedy from the Coen Brothers (Joel directed, and he and Ethan wrote the screenplay from a ""true story"", which won them Oscars). Frances McDormand, William H. Macy (in a star-making performance) and nearly everyone else in the cast give funny, credible and memorable performances, but the film itself is wobbly (purposefully, yet often irritatingly so), padded, and at times brutal--but nearly always undermined by a quasi-comedic tone which is both tiresome and tasteless. Despite strong scenes, it is over-scaled and cut very broadly, and cannot escape the Coens' penchant for self-reverence. **1/2 from ****",=
24,22 October 2006,CineCritic2517,1, Shiny Happy Tedium,"What is it about these movies from the Coen brothers which appeals to so many people? How can anyone enjoy a slow paced, over-the-top acted borefest with an impressive collection of the most annoying personalities available. Movies which don't seem to go anywhere despite the fact that there is plenty of story to go about. It must be something masochistic which I don't get.",t

26,11 July 2005,dtb,10, Frances & The Coens at Their Oscar-Winning Finest!,"Even people I know who can't stand the Coen Brothers' style *love* this slyly low-key comedy-thriller. Unlike so many ""offbeat"" movies, the quirkiness of FARGO's Oscar-winning screenplay never cancels out its warmth or suspense as the Coens deftly balance clever plotting (*not* really based on a true story, as a poor disturbed Japanese woman found out when she came to the U.S. to dig up the hidden ransom money only to freeze to death trying), engaging characters, scares, poignancy, and the brothers' trademark loopy humor. Darkly hilarious as the kidnappers' bungling is, it renders the violence all the more chilling; one minute you're laughing, the next minute you're cringing over the shock of sympathetic characters meeting swift, bloody deaths. I found myself feeling terribly sorry for poor, sweet, unsuspecting Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud), her vulnerable adolescent son Scotty (Tony Denman), her wealthy father Wade (a delightfully bombastic Harve Presnell), and the other poor slobs unwittingly caught up in car salesman Jerry Lundegaard's plot to get money out of Wade by hiring two thugs to kidnap wife Jean and hold her for ransom, not factoring in the kidnappers' lack of both patience and anger management skills. Nobody plays losers like William H. Macy, and he sure deserved his Best Supporting Actor nomination for playing Jerry, who ought to have his picture in the dictionary next to the word ""inept."" Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are letter-perfect as the loose-cannon wife-snatchers; if Buscemi isn't our generation's Peter Lorre, I don't know who is. But the heart and soul of FARGO is Frances McDormand, who truly earned her Best Actress Oscar here. Looking a bit like a young brunette Carol Burnett, McDormand is beyond superb as Marge Gunderson, the pregnant sheriff (my husband always liked the fact that FARGO doesn't include the nigh-obligatory scene of The Pregnant Heroine Suddenly Going Into Labor At The Worst Possible Time) who runs circles around the bad guys *and* her own well-meaning police force. Courteous and smart, down-to-earth yet slick, her luminous blue-green eyes never missing a thing, McDormand's Marge comes off as a warm Minnesota (is that an oxymoron? :-) female hybrid of Joe Friday and Lt. Columbo (I mean Columbo's stealth smarts, not his sloppiness :-). If you love FARGO, you owe it to yourself to own the deluxe DVD, chock full of way-cool extras too nifty and numerous to go into here -- oh, yah! :-)",_
27,5 April 2005,Cpartak,9, Excellent Film,"Fargo is one of my favorite films of all time and in my opinion deserves to be in the top 10 films of the 90's. From the onset of the movie, with views of the snow covered North Dakota landscape and the beautiful and haunting music of composer Carter Burwell playing in the background until the very last scene, Fargo never lets up. This film is Joel and Ethan Cohen's masterpiece, a truly original and one of a kind work. Every aspect of the film is handled with the utmost precision and care. The screenplay, written by Joel and Ethan, is in my opinion flawless. The dialog is at times serious and at other times hilarious, but most importantly always real and believable. The screenplay would be worth nothing, however, without the superb cast of the film that truly makes the characters come to life. Frances McDormand is perfect as the pregnant sheriff who is assigned to the murder case involving Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare. Steve Buscemi is excellent as always, playing a sleazy kidnapper who is perfectly described in one of the best lines of the film as simply ""funny looking - in a general kind of way"". The best performance, however, comes from William H. Macy who is absolutely brilliant as a desperate man who has everything to lose. Macy completely envelops himself in the role and captures perfectly the essence of a broken man whose world is crumbling all around him. The final scene in the motel when he is caught is incredibly powerful because Macy makes you feel the pain and sorrow that a man must feel when he knows that he's going to prison for the rest of his life.",u

William H.Macy should have won it. His performance as an hypocritical and dishonest car seller is powerful and unforgettable.",r

30,27 April 2019,jmholmes-73727,10, BANALITY OF EVIL VS. BANALITY OF GOOD,"The eternal conflict between good and evil is played out here against the backdrop of a bitter cold American landscape. A group of quirky, ruthless criminals eventually find themselves pursued by a very pregnant cop and her unassuming colleagues. With the Coen brothers at the helm, the audience gets equal doses of humor and violence - often simultaneously - and finally feels awestruck by the simple goodness of Marge and her sweet-tempered husband. This is the movie that should have won the Oscar in '97 but lost to The English Patient which had lots of snob appeal, the one thing Fargo lacked - for sure. It would take years for the Academy to make up for their error by awarding the statuette to the Coen's No Country For Old Men, one of the rare times when the best picture winner actually WAS the year's best picture. Fargo May have lost that year, but one thing it did win was the gratitude of many film-goers for the gift of a wonderfully entertaining crime movie.",

However, where Jones' character seems forfeited to the insurmountable evil, Marge (best character ever?) is unflappable in her determination to beat the bad guys; this covers both ends of Coen-nihilism.

37,6 September 2004,lestewart,7," Okay, but what was the fuss all about? Accents??","I saw this film in 2004, long after the Oscar buzz had died down. I suppose it's a victim of its own hype. I enjoyed the film, but it seemed somehow smaller than I expected. Frances McDormand's Oscar-winning performance seems so trivial, seen through the perspective of eight years. The story is okay, though I again wonder about the Oscar the Coens received. (The 1996 Oscars were a somewhat weak field.) I spent most of the movie wondering if people in Minnesota and the Dakotas really talk that way, or is ""Fargo"" as much a travesty of regional accents as most ""southern"" movies are? Overall, the whole film was a nicely filmed, tight little story with apparently overdone regional ironies.",

""Fargo"" won an Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Okay, on paper this story really has great potential. I can also understand William H. Macy's nomination somewhat. But nominations for Best Picture and directing?! Really, WTF?! All the characters in the film, except the cold-blooded sociopath, are portrayed as slightly falling behind in their mental development. Both their actions and how they are portrayed by the cast cause chronic embarrassment transfers throughout the film. Something like that would work in some types of comedy, but with such characters and acting, to call this movie a drama or a thriller ... WTF ?! Directing also has nothing to do with these genres. Drama and tension do not occur even in trace amounts. The story may be a true event, and in reality it was probably a drama and a thriller, but the way it is presented in this movie is totally frivolous. It had the potential for upsetting drama, for a suspenseful thriller, and even for a morbid comedy, but this mix of the Coen brothers looks like a clumsy result of their hesitation to opt for the genre. Watchable, but probably the most overrated movie I saw in years.",

It is very well put together and the plot is constantly evolving into a deeper shade of creepiness. At times scary (not in the horror movie sense) and quite rich in dark humour, this is one of those movies that gives you a weird felling inside even an hour after its over. The music is quite appropriate and unlike Scarface, is timeless. The camera work is usually quite basic but whoever directed the photography had the enjoyable habit of giving us interestingly artistic segways between scenes. This is the first film so far that I've given a 10 out of 10. I was going to give it a 9, but I couldn't think of a reason to take any points from perfect.",

What they can't achieve with excellent dialogue, well-spun stories, and logical continuity in plotting, the Coens make up for via blood, lust, more blood, and then more blood. Vanquished from their movies is any sense of humanity or hope, and we are left in what I can best describe as a ""bleakscape"" - where the great positive is the presence of so much that is negative.

59,14 March 2001,michaelRokeefe,7, One of the funniest dark comedies of all time.,Ethan and Joel Coen are at it again. Their masterful directing and writing makes this movie unforgettable. Snowy North Dakota sets the mood real well for this maliciously funny story of a botched kidnapping. William Macy is a car salesman in the need of some big bucks. He hires two inept scum buckets (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare)to kidnap his wife thus letting him cash in on a huge ransom to be paid by his father-in-law.

The only way my friends and I could continue to watch after the first hour was to MST3K it, shouting comments at our TV screen that at least kept us amused. There was a whole lot of snow..a bunch of really 'meaningful' scenes including snow.  Some more snow.  Some person who was so pregnant she could hardly walk, but seemed just fine stalking down the rabid killer at the end...oh, and she was in the snow when she did it.  Then there was some more snow.  I think the snow had a really bad accent, but I cannot be sure, because eventually I couldn't even stand looking at the screen to see who was saying their incredibly banal and annoying lines. Fargo is boring.  Fargo is bad.  Never watch Fargo, not even to put you to sleep.  It just isn't worth it.",
61,7 February 2020,jayjaycee,9, McDormand is a queen!,"""Fargo"" is a 1996 (comedic) thriller (officially) directed by Joel Coen starring Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. I gotta admit that I've already watched it roughly one year ago when I had personal issues and was in a bad mood that resulted in a disability to like films in general and that I heavily disliked this film. Now that the worst of my personal problem is over and I'm able to appreciate everything again, I had the strange feeling that I didn't do this film justice and that I had to give it a rewatch and after finding this nice little Mediabook I knew I had to set things straight. Like I expected, this film is actually pretty good. There's so much to cherish in it and I still cannot believe that, as the opening titles state, all these depicted events are based on a true story. It's just insane. What appears to be another brilliant gathering of thoughts of the Coen brothers really happened in 1987. They took it and made it a brilliant comedic thriller. Yes, I say it's a comedic thriller, because overall it might be a thriller, but there too many scenes that feature crude humour that I couldn't leave that part out. Actually, it's undeniable that in it's cold core it's a black satirical crime flick. First of all, the way how the plot is constructed and links several storylines with weird, but original characters is simply superb. It's full of funny running gags, dialogue and it perfectly combines the right amount of abstruse humour and true earnestness. From the wannabe gangster duo, to a desperate car salesman in the need for cash to a pregnant, but still determined police chief there's not a single character that is boring in any way. This cold-blooded thriller features so many outstanding actors and actresses that made them come to life with such an easiness. Leading lady Frances McDormand (who only has had one hour of screentime to again proof that she's the greatest) delivered an ingenious performance as the protagonist police chief. She's such a sweet lady and she dominates every single scene she's in, also the way she speaks is just lovely. Definitely one of the greatest actresses in the business. But let's not forget to praise Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the quirky and evilly hilarious kidnappers and William H. Macy as the salesman who also knew to entertain with their weird charisma. Set in a scenery of frozen highways and endless widths of cold snow they all manage to create this unique atmosphere. Also, mostly enabled by the breathtaking cinematography of Roger Deakins. I could seriously feel the cold of the film crawling down my spine although I was sitting in my warm room under my even warmer blanket. It's so beautifully shot and moody that I still cannot understand why it took the Academy more than twenty years to award that man. He's a virtuoso with the camera! All in all, this shockingly beautiful and brutally bloody snow satire is an outstanding entry to the independent cinema, with an inimitable atmosphere and tense music and unbelievably real story lead by a magnificent McDormand. It took me another watch to appreciate this classic flick and feel redemption. Better late than never.",
62,22 February 2006,Surecure,9," Wry, off-beat and undeniably brilliant","What can be said of Fargo that has not been said before? Fargo is a film that cannot be cornered with any easy definition. The Coen brothers have defined themselves with a style that is unique and refreshing and Fargo stands as one of their masterworks.

Fargo either missed that obstacle or the entire film consisted of a variation of it, either way it failed me from the first 5 minutes I was unhappy with this film. Just stripped down simple times in a simple place with complicated deadly themes. Disregard the value of life and be entertained. Art? yes lots of art, if you want to think it's there.. This movie should not have been the staple for the Coen brothers, people hold this movie in such high regard it just makes me think they are just wanting to sound smart because they only had to watch it twice to understand it. That and Wood chipper wood chipper wood chipper.. Yes I always hear the talk about the wood chipper scene, over & over, maybe the highlight of the film? wow.. so sad.. This film is nothing but a basic simple life town with wood chipper shock value. Bring up Fargo in a coversation & you will hear the words ""wood chipper"" within five seconds..",
64,19 August 2013,campbell-russell-a,10, Ordinary Good Defeats Ordinary Evil,"Evil as depicted in films such as ""Fargo"" and ""Badlands"" is much more disturbing than in films in which evil geniuses or devilish fiends systematically carry out their plans. In ""Fargo"" unintelligent evil is matched against seemingly ordinary good people as embodied by Frances McDormand and good wins hands down. And it's not just a case of good defeats evil by catching and punishing it. That's the genius of this film. Enjoying the ordinary life shines through in Margie's relationship with her husband and the film does not patronize their homespun but genuine affection. Margie's comment to the dimwitted murderer about it being a beautiful day and ruining it over ""a little bit of money"" rings true because of the regrettably ridiculous tangle of folly caused by greed and insensitivity that has preceded it. Margie's final comment to her husband that they are ""doing pretty good"" is perfectly in keeping with the tale and its tone. Brutality has been beaten by simple human decency but with no overt sentimentality or grandly moral speechifying.",

Every character is genuine, believable, and Home, not Hollywood, spun. The suspense rolls in and out like a San Francisco fog. The side shows that are built in are amazing (sheriff's conversation at a bar with old acquaintance - stamp conversations - breakfast makings). The whole film is an American Shakesphere. I actually know frequent moviegoers who have not seen Fargo (and Sling Blade and Shine). I feel a special sorrow for them. Back to Fargo, every time I watch it I don't want it to ever end. I even sometimes find myself wishfully thinking I could move up there, it's a Lake Wobegone, and then the movie would never end. Fargo is as close to capturing and portraying real life as a director and bunch of actors can get. I wish IMDb had a just one time eleven so I could crown it emperor above all.",

It has a simple script and dull 'normal' characters. However due to the way the story is written en acted out by its actors, the movie becomes an absolute masterpiece and the power of the movie is in its 'normal' every day characters who are all in one way or another quite idiotic. The movie however doesn't force anything and all of the characters in the movie are portrayed as normal every day persons. Yes, all of the characters have their shortages but in a way, haven't we all? It makes the characters extremely realistic and it makes their actions all somewhat understandable, so we can easily relate to all of them.",

Yes she is not in it the first third of the film, but afterwards she is probably the main character. The other thing debatable here is William H. Macy's supporting nomination.

79,3 April 2006,matt_tawesson-1,10, Great dose of comedy and thriller!!,"Great movie starring William H. Macy, Frances McDormand, and Steve Buscemi. When I first saw this movie a few years ago on VHS, I had noticed the information notice at the beginning stating that this was based on a true story from 1987. Now I know that this picture was NOT based on a true event from what I learned a while back. How misleading that is. Anyway, the movie is about a young man named Jerry Lundegaard (played by Macy) who works at an auto dealership and hires two guys to kidnap his wife so that he can pay off his debts (his wife was wealthy). Jerry Lundegaard is the kind of guy who was very stupid and not really honest in his ways. Anyone who is in tremendous debt that hires someone to have a relative or relatives of theirs kidnapped and/or killed in order to pay off his or her own debts is surely asking to get themselves landed in prison. Right after Jerry's wife is kidnapped, he comes back home to find that his wife is not there and ""acts"" like he's worried and concerned. His concerned feelings are very phony and all he wanted was to get greedy, just to pay off his debts. To me, Jerry was a selfish guy. I have absolutely NO RESPECT, WHATSOEVER for people who try to pay off their own debts by hiring someone to kidnap and/or kill their wealthy relatives. Then, when he gets in touch with the two men he ""hired"" to do this awful and sadistic deed some more, things get out of hand for him. The guys demand more money (they're just as greedy as Jerry), they had killed three people on the evening of the same day that they kidnapped the wife (a state trooper who was just doing his job by pulling them over for forgetting to put the temporary tags on this new car was shot, and two passers by who slowed down to witness what was going on were shot as well). Frances McDormand gave a wonderful performance as the very pregnant officer chief assigned to the case. This is a movie worth watching with lots of comical scenes (not the ones of violence, of course) and some dramatic ones as well. It is worth watching. I also like the Indian guy, Shep Proudfoot. He was seen a few times in the movie, but I thought he was funny as well. Check the scene where he gets back at the guy at his residence. That is something!!!!",

""Fargo"" hits on all cylinders. The dialogue, acting, music and photography are all top-notch. Although ""Fargo"" has a lot of laughs, it annoys me when people call it a comedy. People laugh when the wife is running around in the shower curtain. I'm sorry but that scene is scary not funny. I think people laugh at that scene because they're uncomfortable watching what's going on. Other than a few moments like that, ""Fargo"" is a practically flawless movie. It'a a true classic.

On the other hand, it was a disappointment to notice Stormare as this actor really cringes me with his too much attitude verified as always in this movie. As i have written in my review for « Arizona Junior », the Cohen brothers are the movies cousin of Stephen King as they are really share this taste for the rural America. Here, the country land is all the more put in relief as it's winter time. The story is interesting because it's a true drama that is chilly as it's unbelievable that the husband found such a stupid idea and such bums to help him ! In this strange world, Frances is totally exceptional : i can't really explain but she has the gift to put me at rest, to make me happy and her character is really like this : she smiles to everyone, she is respected by her friends, her co-workers, she has a caring husband and will be soon a mother.

For #488, all I will say is that, after watching this three times, Fargo is a fine piece of cinema, with an emphasis on a minimalist approach to story-telling and without much in the way of theatrics. The setting is bleak, the dialog is mostly direct and to-the-point, and the characters are well-drawn, what few main characters there are. I thought Steve Buscemi was wonderful as the villain in a humorously sick way. The one negative comment I have is that I feel the movie ends much too abruptly: too many loose threads left hanging. I thought the viewer was entitled to know a little bit more about why Jerry (William H. Macy) would go to such outlandish lengths to raise money as to stage his own wife's kidnapping. The fact that he ""owed money"" or ""got in over his head"" wasn't quite enough for me as an explanation since I had kept asking myself during the course of this escapade, ""Why?

96,15 January 2021,chetanhasallmoney,9, 8.6/10. A pretty darn good movie.,"Fargo is black comedy crime film directed and written by the Coen Brothers. Frances Macdormand, William H Macy, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are the part of the main cast. The movie has some very funny moments and overall maintains that comedic vibe. The performances by the main cast are wonderful and they fit their characters so well. The cinematography is wonderful as you will expect from Roger Deakins, one of the best cinematographers working today. The direction is really well done and the dialogue is truly great. The dialogue is realistic, but at the same time fits the story nicely and keeps you engaged. Two characters, Marge and Jerry, stick out as they are explored considerably. Jerry is a timid guy who is desparate for money. He thinks by having his wife kidnapped and keeping a chunk of the ransom, he will have enough money. His plan goes horribly wrong as he hires two men, Carl and Gaear, but Gaear turns out to be a sociopath who kills multiple people in the film. Jerry really wants to help his family but he is incredibly stupid. Then there is Marge who is the police chief of Brainerd. She is the most normal person in this movie and is really nice. She is a smart detective and lives with her husband. She successfully catches Gaear who also murders his accomplice, Carl, and arrests him. She is the good person in this film and Frances Macdormand plays her masterfully. The film has very few flaws. I would have liked them to explore Gaear more as he is an interesting character but he is explored moderately. The soundtracks were really good but sometimes loud. Overall Fargo is a great and enjoyable film.",

This scheme blows up in his face after he hires the wrong thugs in Fargo: Steve Buscemi as motormouth Carl Showalter and Peter Stormare as taciturn Gaear Grimsrud.

99,13 January 2009,Jacques98,1, Manipulative to the audiencebut not how you think.,"It's hard to deny that the vast majority of cinemaAmerican or otherwiseis going to be ridiculously overrated by a certain group of people. When that group is the actual American population itself, a lot of negative reviews like to label the said film as ""The most overrated movie of all time!"" The fact is, no matter if you or I like a film or not, almost everything gets more recognition than it deserves in America. Average movies are stretched out into ""modern masterpieces"" simply because of the utter lack of creativity or originality in cinema overall. It's much easier to force yourself to feel contentment in something you just wasted your time and money on than admit it was terrible. It's a common misconception to ""look for the good in every film"", rather than actually admit that you've seen/heard everything the film showed so many times you almost feel asleep or lost interest and made out with your girlfriend for 3/4ths of the movie, then call it a great film just because the critics did. Everything I just mentioned above could be the reason Fargo is so overrated. But if you want me to be honest, Fargo is so downright pathetic, no matter how hard I try, I can't figure out why it's overrated. At all. I just don't understand it.",

Although engaging in its depiction, Fargo gives this idea that there is a deeper meaning in it. The opening title sequence claims that this film is based on a true story, when really it's the culmination of many stories the Coen brothers have investigated. When promoting the film, in a 1996 interview with Charlie Rose, Charlie himself made a comment regarding the nature of the title sequence, and how it demonstrates how far the Coen brothers will go. It was a joke, and although it was jolly in spirit, the Coen's own take on the title was that it was battle between choosing Brainerd or Fargo. Obviously Fargo won that bout. But overall the tone of the film in its initial portrayal, is that it is a simple film, and the motives of the characters are simple to the extent that they can create a complexity within Fargo that we as an audience strive to understand them behind their own simplicity. As with any Coen Brother's film, there is an inevitable sense of tragedy within the story, and because it is shown in such a casual and forward manner, all we can do is laugh.",

At least, that is how the opening captions announce it, white text on black, alerting the audience to its degree of seriousness and authenticity. This little white lie riffs on the same types of preludes often seen in true crime stories or serials such as Dragnet, always beginning with the ominous brass theme and a warning: ""The story you are about to hear is true. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent."" And listen to how Carter Burwell's score serenades the opening shot of a car slowly appearing in deep fog, a Norwegian folk tune beginning with a few bells and whistles but then soaring to a crescendo of operatic ridiculousness. If Fargo takes place in chilly, rural North Dakota, mostly forgotten by America, its male characters certainly don't believe it. They think (or desire) themselves as self-made men, figures that can withstand the harsh winter and forge a path ahead. Much like that Paul Bunyan fella. ",

I can see now how it has influenced later films and character development in the industry. McDormand perfectly creates a wacky character that you just can't seem to get enough of.

111,8 February 2005,Mr_Vai,2," In retrospect, a very mean and insensitive film","When I first saw this movie, it had been advertised as a ""black comedy."" As a result, numerous people in the audience giggled and laughed at various scenes, some of which, were not intended to be funny at all. I enjoyed the film alright, largely due to the wonderful performances of Steve Buscemi and Kenneth Macy. I have to admit, that I did snicker at some scenes. HOWEVER, after recently viewing this film, I have done a complete 180. This is an ugly film and very mean spirited. Oh yeah, I know that the Coens issue a disclaimer about how they were not changing the story, out of respect to the dead, BULL! Excuse me if I am wrong, but the real events having to do with this case involved numerous people being killed? So, why so much emphasis on making fun of the way people in Minnesota talk? In the story, a boy is told his mother has been kidnapped by unknown assailants. So why does the scene close with a close up shot of the ""Accordion King"" poster, which is completely ridiculous? Did the Coens actually see that poster in the boy's house? Or did they just want to keep cracking little jokes? While the police chief is supposed to be investigating the killings, she goes off to have this lunch with a comedic Asian character. Funny scene? You bet. But you know what, that whole scene was completely made up, did not happen. So why, are we getting more comedy thrown into this story? Did the Coens not say that the events in this movie were all true? And this is what bothers me. None of the humor in this film actually involves the specifics of this case. The humor is all added to mock a very real and tragic series of events. Hey, if you want to produce fiction, fine. But don't claim your story is non-fiction and then tack on fictitious comedic scenes. Great performances or not, this is an ugly and insensitive film.",

There is no saving grace. But I finally sat through a showing to critique, and it could be used as a diagram of how not to make a movie for male audiences who aren't die hard Nazi party members. It's supposed to be about a blotched kidnapping of William Macy's wife, and one of the two men who did it is a psychopathic lunatic. To appease the females, and grab the large Nazi audience of the U.S., the director chose to contrive the plot so to kill any woman with hair darker than complete blonde. Women love movies that do this, since they like to imagine a world with less competition. And women usually make the choice of what movie to see in a household. The acting is horrid, too. They try to do the accent of Hoosiers and people further West, but real people enunciate much better. The accents are horrible, and show incompetence.

Macy, Frances McDormand and Steve Buscemi. Often seen as the film that launched the Coen Brothers successful career, Fargo without a doubt deserves all the credit it receives. The story focuses around a spineless, nervous car salesman who arranges for his wife to be kidnapped and held for a ransom of $80,000 to extort from his wealthy father-in-law and boss, in his desperation for money to repay an outstanding loan. Which ends up going horrifically wrong resulting in a series of grizzly murders. Fargo fantastically blends its sharp wit of dry humour and black comedy with its gruesome, thrilling and intriguing narrative, the two seem to go hand-in-hand perfectly with Fargo having scenes that will have you bursting out laughing and others on the edge of your seat. Fargo also features beautiful cinematography with wide, expansive shots of snow covered landscapes as well as a fitting dark and unsettling soundtrack. Each actor/actress completely owns their character making their motivations and actions clear, as well as relatable. Fargo has but a few nit-picking flaws, such as a particular scene which seems unnecessary to the advancement of the plot and feels out of place, in which Frances McDormand's character meets an old friend. Another is a plot-line which focused around Peter Stormare's character Gaear Grimsrud- not enough of the story was focused around his role as it should or could have been, also another flaw being the slight overuse of the word 'ya'. Overall, Fargo is a phenomenal film, both winning 2 well deserved Oscar's and launching the Coen Brothers career onto a new level, proving they are two of the greatest filmmakers of the modern film era. Not forgetting notifying the world of the traditional (and comedic) Minnesotan accent. Fargo is hilarious, violent, tense and intriguing. 9/10",

He looked at me and laughed, saying, ""I was just going to say that."" We then promptly forgot about it and started talking about someone else. It seemed like it would have done well as an extended episode of some bizarre TV series along the lines of ""Twin Peaks,"" etc. Something that you would watch once, and then next week, something different would happen with the same characters. But as a self-contained film, well, it's not enough of a story, not enough of a film. The months later, it was nominated for several Oscars, including Best Picture. On hearing that, I thought, ""Wow, Hollywood really liked it."" I have to admit I was rooting for Brenda Blethyn to win the Oscar for ""Secrets and Lies"" as I thought hers was the best performance of the year.

FARGO is actually a film that I like to reference when a movie like THE DARK KNIGHT (another overrated piece of trash) comes out because FARGO is one of the first examples of a film where I realized that EVERYONE that praised it so highly back in the day could NOT for the life of them truly justify WHY it was so great! With THE DARK KNIGHT, at the very least fans of that flick can point to the one good thing about it and that is Heath Ledger's performance (but nothing else).",

135,5 July 2005,bryan_nixon79,10," ""Fargo"" does not belong in the wood chipper, unlike the majority of films today","Fargo is a breath of fresh air. It is inspiring for movie-goers, because the majority of films lack inspiration or originality. Joel and Ethan Coen's masterpiece is funny, sadistic, dark, violent, intense, and true. The setting is cold and harsh, which is perfect for the events that unfold in the storyline. It deserves its place in the top 100 films of all time. The acting is top-of-the-line, as well. Frances McDormand deserved her Academy Award. Due to these facts, you simply must watch this film. The thing that impresses me the most with this film, as with other films by the Coen brothers, is that it portrays what can result from a lie, which eventually explodes and ultimately leads to death and madness. Thou shalt not lie.",
136,19 November 2007,ackstasis,7," ""Blood has been shed, Jerry.""","It's probably inevitable that, after hearing so much about its greatness, 'Fargo' proves something of a minor disappointment. After numerous critical successes {including their finest film to date, 'Miller's Crossing (1990)' and the Palme d'Or-winning 'Barton Fink (1991)'}, Joel and Ethan Coen apparently struck gold with 'Fargo (1996),' the ""true story"" of a kidnapping and murder in the icy wastelands of Minnesota. The film is a thematic retread of the brothers' debut picture, 'Blood Simple (1984)' {of which I was not overly-fond}, and explores how a seemingly-simple crime can escalate into the tragic and devastating destruction of innocent (and not-so-innocent) lives. The Coens would return once again to this popular theme with the accomplished film-noir, 'The Man Who Wasn't There (2001),' which is arguably one of their best efforts. 'Fargo' was the filmmakers' first real Oscar success, retrieving seven Academy Award nominations and two wins (Best Writing and Best Actress in a Leading Role {Francis McDormand}). However, the film's Best Picture chances were upset by Anthony Minghella's majestic wartime romance epic, 'The English Patient.'",

The Coen Brothers, being brought up in Minnesota, critique the Minnesota Nice nature - people with their plain and warm exterior with folksy speaking style, but not so empathetic or well-wishing from within; the characters are as cold and distant as the letters of the film title because the characters are as emotionally isolated as story's vast empty landscape.

143,8 February 2021,Jackblyth8,10, One of My All-Time Favourites,"The Coen brothers supply us with a dark 90's classic. The pair create a snowy and low-temperature environment, used only as pathetic fallacy to foreshadow the eerie and cold-blooded business that occurs in the depths of Minnesota, Minneapolis. Steve Buscemi, William H. Macy and Frances McDormand star as the main roles, portraying their characters with care and excellence. Emulating previous 90's films, 'Fargo' establishes the ongoing, progressive storyline that comes closer and closer to reaching its conclusion. Running for a mere 98 minutes, the film had an overall box office of $60.6 million, cleverly stemming from its $7 million budget. Ensuring that we are constantly on edge, the spectacle involves scenes with fast-paced music, to add dramatic tension and build up to a 'big' moment in the watch. In the winter of 1987, Jerry Lundegaard, the sales manager at an Oldsmobile dealership in Minneapolis, is desperate for money. He floats a GMAC loan worth $320,000, which he collateralizes with nonexistent vehicles and is unable to pay back. On the advice of the dealership mechanic (and paroled ex-convict) Shep Proudfoot, Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota and hires a duo of small-time criminals consisting of an outlaw named Carl Showalter and his sidekick and partner in-crime Gaear Grimsrud to kidnap his wife, Jean, and extort a ransom from his wealthy father-in-law and dealership boss, Wade Gustafson. Payment would be a new car, and half of the $80,000 ransom. Jerry pitches Wade a lucrative real estate deal, and believes Wade has agreed to front him $750,000. Jerry tries to get Shep to call off the kidnapping but is unsuccessful. Jerry then learns that Wade plans to make the deal himself, giving Jerry only a finder's fee. At Jerry's home, Carl and Gaear carry out the arranged kidnapping. As they transport Jean to their remote cabin on Moose Lake, a state trooper pulls them over outside Brainerd for driving without temporary tags. Carl's attempt to bribe the trooper fails, and when the trooper hears a sound from the back seat where Jean is tied up, Gaear kills him, then chases down two witnesses and shoots them dead as well. Buscemi's character is far less intimidating than his second in command, who prefers not to socialise and is ruthless in his acts of murder, however, Carl's authority and dominance is menacing, forming the perfect villainy duo. The following morning, pregnant Brainerd police chief Marge Gunderson discovers that the dead trooper was ticketing a car with dealer plates and that later, two men driving a dealership vehicle checked into the nearby Blue Ox Motel with two call girls and placed a call to Proudfoot. After questioning the prostitutes, Gunderson drives to Wade's dealership, where Proudfoot feigns ignorance and Jerry insists no cars are missing. While in Minneapolis, Marge reconnects with Mike Yanagita, an old classmate. Yanagita awkwardly tries to romance Marge, before breaking down, saying his wife has died. Marge learns the following morning that Yanagita was lying due to a combination of loneliness and insanity. Jerry informs Wade that the kidnappers have demanded $1 million and will deal only through him. Meanwhile, Carl, in light of the complication of three murders, demands that Jerry hand over the entire $80,000. GMAC gives Jerry just 24 hours to prove the existence of the vehicles or face legal consequences. Marge represents the sanity of the city, working her professional job efficiently for the sake of her husband and expected baby. Her characterisation is portrayed perfectly by Frances McDormand - capturing her innocent and caring nature, and her dedication to her work. While Carl is having sex with another call girl in a motel room, Proudfoot enters and attacks him in a rage for bringing him under suspicion, having been questioned by Marge earlier in the day. Carl orders Jerry to deliver the ransom immediately, but Wade insists on making the money drop himself, driving to meet Carl carrying a loaded revolver. At the drop location in a Minneapolis parking garage, Wade tells Carl he will not hand over the money without seeing Jean, but does not yet display his concealed weapon. An enraged Carl pulls a gun and shoots Wade before Wade brandishes his revolver and shoots Carl in the jaw, severely wounding him; enraged, Carl shoots Wade to death and kicks his corpse; Jerry arrives moments later and finds Wade's corpse along with that of a parking attendant Carl shot and killed while fleeing. After fleeing the scene, Carl is astounded to discover that the briefcase contains $1 million. He removes $80,000 to split with Gaear, then buries the rest alongside the highway. At the cabin, Gaear has killed Jean; Carl says they must split up and leave the state immediately. Carl and Gaear get into a heated argument over who will keep the car, with Carl using his injury as justification. After Carl shouts insults at Gaear and moves to take the car, Gaear kills and dismembers him with an axe. The reoccurring motif of Jean and Jerry's son Scotty, is clearly significant. He is unaware of the destruction of his family - losing his grandfather, mother and technically speaking, his relationship with his father. The individual is oblivious to the situation, stressed over his mother's absence, he is almost forgotten, a key representation of the effects to such dangerous business strategies. Reflecting on Yanagita's convincing lies, Marge returns to Gustafson's dealership. Jerry continues to insist that he is not missing any cars. Marge asks him to check the inventory, then spots him fleeing the dealership, and calls the State Police. The next morning, she drives to Moose Lake on a tip from a local bar owner who had reported a ""funny-looking guy"" bragging about killing someone. Outside a cabin, she finds the car; nearby, Gaear is feeding Carl's dismembered body into a woodchipper. Gaear attempts to flee on foot, only for Marge to shoot him in the leg and arrest him. Jerry flees to a Bismark motel, where North Dakota police arrest him after he attempts to escape through a window. Marge's husband Norm, whose mallard painting has been selected for a 3-cent postage stamp, complains that his friend's painting will be on the first class stamp. Marge reassures Norm that lots of people use 3-cent stamps, in particular when the price of postage increases and they need to make up the difference; the two happily anticipate the birth of their child in two months. The Coen brothers centre around three groups of two, one being the two villains in the film, providing the conflict within the visual. The second pairing is the Lundegaard's and the deterioration of their family, reinforcing that actions have consequences. Jean pays the highest price for her husband's misfortune and inexperience, losing her father in the process too. The third duo Marge and Norm are the diametric opposites to the other two, they aim only to do good and on numerous occasions reciprocate love and affection to each other. Despite stating, the film is not true, one thing that is: Brainerd is no special place.",
144,14 September 2009,tjsdshpnd,8, A Cult Classic Not To Be Missed,"Good Black Comedy movies are a rarity and black comedies on supposedly real life incidents are extremely scarce. Fargo's creative team including the multi-faceted Coen brothers made it a point to illustrate in the beginning of the movie that all events are based on real life incidents with their unique 'touch' of-course. Fargo is a story about a car salesman who is in desperate need of money and thus he hires two crooks to kidnap his wife so that he can get a hefty ransom from his father-in-law (Who is a wealthy man and not much fond of his (son-in-law). Things go wrong when the crooks had to kill 3 people to hide their identity and thus a cycle is started of blood-shed which is investigated and eventually solved by a pregnant female cop who is actually the protagonist or the lead of this movie.

Jerry's father in law is a rich man who doesn't seem to like or respect Jerry a bit. Jerry is a car sales executive in a showroom and think that he deserves to be compensated and helped by his father in law.
His wife Jean is a satisfied housewife who is completely settled in her middle class life. She doesn't care about her father's abundance of money and her husband's lack of money.
The kidnapping is done but the kidnapping also leads to three irresponsible and avoidable murders on the road by Grimsrud where we also get to see his dark and unpredictable nature.
The small scheme of kidnapping and asking his father in law for money goes haywire and now involves murder, This is where Marge comes in.
Marge is the Police Chief in the area and her family is as normal as it can be.
Her husband and her, were both in Police once but then her husband left his job and spends time painting while Marge is working as Police chief.
Marge is good at her job but she is very girly from inside. She is also conservative in her nature. She is going through her first pregnancy period and also solves the case like that.
The best part about Fargo is its non-genre defining structure. The film is not funny yet the way character behaves you always feel something funny in the scenes. You think it is going to be a funny film when suddenly there is murders and blood all over the place and still the film appears to be funny.
You are never sure which mood you should carry while watching the film.
The character of Marge impresses you more than anything.
There were two things which I think was difficult for anyone to digest initially about her. First was her pregnancy and second was her meeting with her old friend Mike.
Mike, at first appears to be interested in Marge despite knowing that she is happily married and pregnant. We become sure of it when he hugs for longer time than it usually takes for someone to hug and also he forcefully tries to sit next to her. Mike says that he is going through a tough period and his wife has recently died. Marge feels sad for him.
Later Marge comes to know from another former classmate that Mike was lying and his wife is healthy as a bull.
This is the key factor which makes Marge conclude that maybe Jerry is lying about his wife too.
This results in her catching the criminals and Jerry.
I love how Marge says ""Yeah"" when she is talking on phone which is very synonymous to any housewife lingo. It goes against her profession of a Police chief.
She is pregnant which makes her vulnerable but that doesn't stop her from doing things that she has to do. She works all day long and yet manages to find time for her husband and her home.
Fargo is one of the rarest examples of how you can mix multiple genres into one and escape successfully into it.
The film never answers your questions and is crazily unapologetic.
It never tells you what happened to all the money that Carl buried in the snow.
It never tells you what happened to Jerry's wife and his son.
The film was good because though it never answers all these questions yet you kind of feel satisfied that every wrong guy met their fate. Jerry and Grimsrud both gets arrested.
I love how they end the film with what can be the most cliched dialogue in the film.
Marge says, ""Why kill so many people for little amount of money?""
This shows the contradictory innocent nature of Marge and how despite working in Police and catching criminals all the time, somehow her innocence isn't tampered with. She just can't understand why people commit crime. Life is too normal for her.
This Oscar winning drama is definitely a must watch.",

This is without a doubt the most over-rated movie I have ever seen, with zombie-like acting(on purpose? why?? is this a satire??), and terrible writing. It's one of those movies that I laughed at, not with, and I have no idea if it was a comedy on purpose or by accident. If I lived in Fargo I'd be plenty p***ed off because this film makes the people there look like cardboard figures pretending to be goofy moroninc humans. The Brothers Coen geniuses? I think not.

The plot was unimaginative, the characters insipid (which I hate to say, because I like William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi otherwise)  and the writing weak at best.

This one didn't hold my attention like The Man Who Wasn't There and it didn't make me laugh as often as Intolerable Cruelty. It was quite funny at some points, no doubt about that, and often it was far more funny than most other comedies... but too many of the jokes seemed to be repeated over and over. The pregnant lady eating, the locals saying 'yah', William H. Macy's character stuttering or throwing a fit... I don't know, it seemed like the Coen's couldn't think of enough good jokes, so they just repeated those they had over and over. Some of the jokes are insanely funny, though. Most of these come from Steve Buscemi. Just about every scene he's in, he steals the show. When he's not on screen, you're usually somewhat bored. One thing I also found myself getting a bit annoyed over the things left unresolved, and the scenes that seemed pointless. There were several characters in the film that could easily have been written out with no change to the overall product, apart from making it move faster. The plot is good, original and full of clever twists. The pacing is somewhat good, but too much of the film is boring. Like I said, Buscemi saves every scene he's in, but it's often boring in scenes not involving him. The acting is good, for the most part. Frances McDormand gives a great performance. The rest of the leads are all credible. The characters are well-written and credible. The humor is good, and at times great. A pretty good Coen brothers' film that could have been better. Too slow-moving and repetitive for my tastes, but definitely worth a watch, especially for fans of Steve Buscemi.

This is a crime movie, a bag full of money, two killers, a female cop and misfortunes. As said, a good movie, but no more than that. This is the problem.

Almost every Coen movie is compared with Fargo, so found disappointing, critics say that it was a masterpiece. This is the problem. The movie is good, but there is nothing that great in the movie. By the way, Fargo is not flawed, but I did not like the end. It was raw and too simple for such a movie. Honestly, I liked A Simple Plan more, even if it was inspired by Fargo and made later.

I like the winter scenes in both movies and the story lines are both at least good.  However, Fargo goes a little too far.  Aspects like the chipper are good/funny, but a continuous pounding of the ""yeah, ya bechas"" is too much.  Understandably it is a little funny to make fun of the midwesterners that have a pro-wrestler governor, live in the ""cold"", (had the gall to make Might Ducks 2+3), and have made fun at New Yorkers and others in the past, but there is such a thing as too much of a bad/good thing.",

231,23 August 2009,sjmdd,10, Should be heralded as one of the all time great movies,"You know when a movie is an absolute masterpiece, or a complete stinker, they are the easiest to review, hands down. Its the films that sit right in the middle that are hardest. Anyhow, without a shadow of a doubt Fargo falls into the former category. It was good the first time i saw it; now I've viewed it a second time it truly is a masterpiece of gargantuan proportions. There's so much right with this movie... in fact I'm unable to think of anything negative about it at all. The story, first and foremost, is a simple one. Jerry Lundegaard hires two crooks to kidnap his wife, whose father in law will pay the ransom, which Jerry will benefit from. But, like most Coen Brothers movies, nothing goes to plan. The Fact that the story is such a simple one is the first main reason why it works so well - don't necessarily over complicate the plot. Ethan and Joel know this, and in simplifying events, allow us to concentrate on the stunning script, the amazing performances and the frozen Minnesotan country. So events go awry... and we are introduced to police chief Marge Gunderson,Frances Mcdormand,AKA Mrs Joel Coen(who deservedly bagged an Oscar), one of the most endearing cinematic creations in recent memory. In a believable, simple way, heavily pregnant Marge puts together the pieces of a terrible crime gone oh so wrong. Its not that its so believable, nor the comic interpretation of the Scandinavian roots of Minessota, nor even the brilliant performances by Mcdormand, William H Macy (a career best), Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare interwoven with a biting, dark, often hilarious script,not even a marvellous score, no its the way in which, at the end, you manage to feel the way in which good prevails over evil a quite riveting and fascinating affair - even with a body count of 7 people, it never feels overly violent. Humanity wins hands down, and that, coupled with all of the above, means that it is in my book, one of the greatest movies ever made. 10/10 David Ford",

The brothers have been serving up heavy doses of irony and dark humor for years, and some viewers are getting tired of them. Still, that's no reason to retroactively criticize their masterpiece, is it? Yes, the film has a very queer sense of humor, but if things like the Minnesota accent drive you nuts, you're not getting the joke (BTW, this doesn't mean that you're stupid, just that you don't share the Coen sense of humor!).

It is captivating, dramatic, engaging, funny, hilarious, intriguing, mesmerizing, sad, and can even be scary at times. It makes me feel a mesh of emotions, that I have yet to find from any other film. I have been watching it for as long as I can remember, and it is the film I find myself going back to most often.

This complicated screenplay about a hostage-taking-for-hire is pure brilliance from the start, and it's the acting that takes it one step beyond that. William Macy and Francis McDormand's characters are in my mind two of the greatest characters ever developed for film.

Fine.  But it's one thing to point out such a vision of reality in a film (successfully accomplished in, say, BADLANDS); it's another for a film to actually BE this vision of reality.  FARGO is a dog-and-pony show, a trick film, intended to make a meta-fictional point by exploiting the film-viewer's pre-supposed moral vacuousness and lurid fascination with sex and violence.  In short, it is not a film of substance and the point is that, truly in the sense which the Coen brothers mean it, only insubstantial, ""half-realized characters"" could be fans of it (naturally, to realize this point is to be ""realized"" and no longer be a fan).

Things go wrong, and police officer Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is on the case. The film won two Oscars in 1997, Best Screenplay and Best Actress (McDormand); I must say that it didn't deserve either of them. In particular, I found McDormand's performance incredibly overrated.

Another very nice thing is the very original cinematography, often not using typical thriller elements and adding a taste of drama to the flick. Visuals and sound are executed meticulously, you see and hear so many little details that not everybody would have thought of.

Basically Jerry Lundegaard (Oscar nominated William H. Macy) has financial problems, and out of desperation, in Fargo, North Dakota, he decides to hire criminals Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his own wife Jean (Kristin Rudrüd). This is in order for his father in law Wade Gustafson (Patch Adams' Harve Presnell) to pay a ransom of $1,000,000, for which the two criminals will get £40,000 of while he keeps the rest. So they kidnap the wife, but on the journey to the secluded cabin they will be keeping her in they are stopped by a policeman who Gaear kills, he also kills two witnesses who crash their car. Investigating this homicide, from Brainerd, Minnesota, is local pregnant chief/sheriff Marge Gunderson (Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Frances McDormand) who is tenacious to catch whoever committed the murders. Jerry, who did originally ask for money from Wade, which he thought he was going to get (not needing the kidnappers anymore) but didn't, gets the ball rolling for the kidnappers ransom money. Being an antagonist man, Wade is insistent that if a $1,000,000 ransom is going to be paid, he will do it himself, and of course Jerry is trying everything he can think of to make sure that does not happen. Marge's investigation leads her to the discovery that the car passing by and killing the victims was hired at the car lot that Jerry works in for Wade, he is obviously very nervous in convincing her he knows nothing about it. It comes to the money drop-off for the ransom, and Wade goes against the wishes of the kidnappers to take it himself, while Gaear keeps an eye on Jean Carl is the one to pickup. Angered by the appearance of the father-in-law and not Jerry he shoots Wade, and he ends up getting shot in the face, and after Carl leaves the parking lot, Jerry is the one to take the body of Wade away. On his way back Carl sees that the case has $1,000,000 instead of an agreed amount, so he buries some at the side of the road in the snow, and when he gets back to the cabin he finds Gaear has killed Jean. Gaear kills Carl with an axe after an argument for the car, and after questioning Jerry again and seeing him flee, Marge finds her way to the cabin where the remaining criminal is putting the body parts of his dead partner in a wood chipper. In the end Gaear is arrested for the five murders, Jerry is caught and arrested for his involvement, and Marge returns home to husband Norm (Volcano's John Carroll Lynch) and they both look forward to the two months left to wait for their baby. Also starring Tony Denman as Scotty Lundegaard, Larissa Kokernot as Hooker #1, Melissa Peterman as Hooker #2 and Steven Reevis as Shep Proudfoot. McDormand gives a nice simple performance that I can see being worthy of the accolade she received, Macy is great as the man setting up the kidnap, and Buscemi and Stormare are equally great as the hopeless but creepy criminals. The stylistic direction by the Coen brothers are brilliant, their scripting is witty, funny and full of some really good thrills, the snowy settings are worth watching, and you can enjoy both the tension and the moments that make you laugh, a fantastic black comedy thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film, , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay.

""Fargo"", however, is my favorite Minnesota film. It's a typical Coen Brothers film and by far their best! Yeah, they make fun of our politeness and our Scandinavian-German accents. As kids we are taught at home and in school, as well as on the job to always say Please and Thank You, hold open doors for others, wait your turn, don't speak loudly or yell and we rarely use the word Yes, for us it's Ya. Some people were embarrassed by this but most of us are proud of our politeness and our Nordic roots. It's known as ""Minnesota Nice."" So, as for ""Fargo"", most of us loved it. None of us talk like the Officer who says, ""I'm gonna have ta ask ya ta git outta da curr."" That said, most of the characters are spot on. Roger Deakins shows the bleakness of a prairie winter, but also its beauty. Carter Burwell's score has a tinge of Scandinavian folk to it. The Coens make fun of us but we don't mind because they've created a masterpiece in ""Fargo"". The cast is superb: Frances McDormand and John Carroll Lynch as Norm & Marge Gunderson are the heart of the film. Steve Buscemi as Carl Showalter, Peter Stormare as Gaear Grimsrud and William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard are a fine trio of bad guys. Kristin Rudrud as Jean Lundegaard, Harve Presnell as Wade Gustafson and Bruce Bohne as Marge's partner Lou are terrific. My favorite character of the cast has a small part but plays it brilliantly and is in my favorite scene. He is Bain Boehlke and he plays Mr. Mohra who is the guy shoveling his driveway and who is describing Carl Showalter as a ""funny looking guy"". I love that scene it really makes me laugh. In spite of its gore, the screenplay of ""Fargo"" is incredibly fascinating and very entertaining from beginning to end. Bravo Joel and Ethan!",
274,4 March 2016,zardoz-13,10, A Cold-Blooded Comedy of Errors,"""Raising Arizona"" filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen have surpassed themselves again with their idiosyncratic dramedy thriller ""Fargo"" about a gallery of memorable characters. A pregnant female police chief investigates a strange kidnapping case and tracks down a pair of ruthless killers and the Minneapolis automobile salesman who hired them. He learns about these two reprobates from a mechanic at the car dealership where he works. Like all first-class Coen brothers' movies, this police procedural operates on two levels and boasts not only eccentric characters but also outlandish predicaments. The use of an unlikely lady police chief, Frances McDormand, who stands in for the standard-issue male protagonist, sets this superior, often satirical crime saga apart from most entries in the genre. Incidentally, McDormand took home an Oscar for Best Actress as Marge Gunderson. Furthermore, the Coens shared the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Although it won only two Oscars, ""Fargo"" received nominations for Best Picture, Best Picture, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing."" ""Fargo"" unfolds with an amusing preamble: ""THIS IS A TRUE STORY. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred."" Of course, most of what happens here is strictly illusory. Like most Hollywood movies, ""Fargo"" is a synthesis of the real and the imaginary. In the article ""Rewind: What Part Of 'Based On' Don't You Understand?"" author Karl Heitmueller wrote: ""Joel Cohen told 'Time Out' that 'if an audience believes that something's based on a real event, it gives you permission to do things they might otherwise not accept.'"" Heitmueller classifies ""Fargo"" and other movies, like ""Ray"" and ""Gangs of New York"" as BOATS movies. According to Heitmueller, ""A BOATS movie is not a documentary, and while watching one we should be smart enough to take everything we see in it with a big ol' grain of popcorn salt. The problem seems to be that audiences often overlook the words ""based on."" It's not Hollywood's fault that, amazingly, many people just don't question what's presented in a BOATS movie — that moviegoers don't stop to consider that it's impossible to know exactly what happened on the doomed fishing boat the Andrea Gale in ""The Perfect Storm."" The contrived plot involves a cash starved car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macey of ""The Cooler""), who hires a couple of lowlife criminals, Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi of ""Con-Air"") and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare of ""The Big Lebowski"") to kidnap his ditzy wife, Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrüd of ""Drop Dead Gorgeous""), whose kidnapping scene is hilarious. Jean gets wrapped up in a shower curtain and scrambles about her house in desperation to escape them. Meantime, Jerry hopes that he can force his gruff father-in-law, Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell of ""Saving Private Ryan""), who owns the car dealership where Jerry works, to pay the ransom. The father-in-law isn't happy about the arrangement. He would rather hand over the loot to the kidnappers than entrust Jerry with the cash. Indeed, scheming Jerry plans to split the loot between the three of them. Ultimately, Marge investigates, tracking down leads, and questions Jerry. Naturally, everything turns into a comedy of errors, and nothing works out for either the desperate car salesman or his paid abductors. Marge proves that he is no pushover when he wields her service revolver. She drops Garear in his tracks when he tries to run from her. Ace British lenser Roger Deakins' cinematography is a pleasure to behold, and he captures the grim setting of North Dakota with its snow-swept terrain. Some of the violence is brutal. When the two kidnappers are pulled over by a state trooper, Gaear shoots him in the head and blood bubbles out of his head like a fountain. The dry dialogue that everybody delivers is interesting, too. ""Fargo"" has thus far spawned two made-for-television shows just as bogus as the movie ""Fargo."" Produced for $7 million, this Coen brothers release generated over $60 million at the box office, making it a fabulously successful movie.",
275,24 January 2010,writers_reign,9, Schmo Business,"In many ways I find this the most satisfying of all Coen Brothers movies I have seen (nine out of sixteen) and mostly the later ones. I enjoyed 'spotting' characters based on Clifford Odets, William Faulkner and Faulkner's long-time Hollywood mistress in Barton Fink but that was only one aspect of a movie that failed to grip me in total. In the case of Fargo it's difficult to identify any negative aspects in a movie that works on so many levels, black comedy, thriller, love story celebrating married love (think William Powell/Myrna Loy without the martinis and wise-cracks)tragedy. Although William H. Macey and Frances MacDormand have rightly been singled out for high praise - which their subsequent work has fully justified - the entire cast work brilliantly as an ensemble. One of the best films of the 90s.",

Macy as a car sales manager who arranges his wife to be kidnapped by a couple of lowlifes (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to milk money out of his rich stepdad (Harve Presnell). Frances McDormand plays the small town cop who investigates matters when the ""victimless crime"" spirals out of control.",

279,21 May 2015,anaconda-40658,9, Far Gone in the Wood Chipper.,"Fargo (1996): Dir: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen / Cast: William H. Macy, Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare, Harve Presnell: Satire about place and happening starring William H. Macy as a car salesman threatened with bankruptcy. He hires two thugs to kidnap his wife but everything goes wrong. His father-in-law insists on delivering the money and Macy is unable to contact the kidnappers. This all concludes with shock, humour and surprise. Splendid directing by Joel and Ethan Coen who previously made Blood Simple and Barton Fink. Frances McDormand is wonderful as a pregnant police woman investigating the case. She is the one character who lives for right, and her dialogue upon solving the case sums it up with blunt delivery. Macy flawlessly plays a desperate man smitten by guilt. He is clearly terrible at crime and even worse at trying to prevent it. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare play two thugs. Buscemi is talkative and ill tempered but it is his final footage that is memorably shocking. Stormare is more reserved and quiet, which conceals his dangerous tendencies that are defeated by a fragile physical state and strong will of an opposing factor. Harve Presnell plays Macy's father-in-law who adds further complications when he decides to deliver the ransom cash himself. Theme exposes guilt and our ever present urge to hide sin. Score: 9 / 10",

Now I'm aware of the fact that Fargo is also highly over-rated.  Three generations of my family grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Fargo, North Dakota.  The mannerisms and speech used by William H Macy and Frances McDormand is realistic but why should I remember this screenplay twenty years from now?  Apparently it is a true story which must have all the fans of Survivor running for their local Blockbuster stores along with the fans of America's Most Wanted and Cops.  When I want to see reality that will impact me for years to come I'll rent something historically significant like Malcolm X or a documentary film like No Man's Land or One Day in September.

Frances McDormand, William H. Macy, and Steve Buscemi are all in career roles, and the supporting cast (including the chilling Peter Stormare) are great too. The cinematography is excellent and I loved the shots on location, which brought back memories; it's striking and makes the film feel authentic. The pace of the film, it's story-telling, dry humor, little observations, and surprise moments all make it highly entertaining even after repeat watches. Gotta love Marge Gunderson (McDormand) too - in her simple and nice way, she's canny, persistent, sensitive, and brave. She does it all, pursuing killers, carrying a baby, tactfully fending off an old high school classmate's advances, and stroking her husband's ego in what is a lovely marriage. What a bright character she is for such a dark tale. Just beware that it's not a true story, despite what that silly opening title card says, which was one of the film's few mistakes.",

This isn't actually based on true events, although the Coens claim that the movie is actually a kind of composite story, weaving together strands from various cases. Usually, that kind of dishonesty would bother me, but in this case it was a relief. Frankly, this is a very violent and bloody movie - and yet at the same time it's also very funny.

To the point it makes it one of the top crime films that is a must watch. It's a serious crime story shown in a subtle and yet engaging manner, with slight awkward humor in it. But still stays consistent as a cold story about greed and the distances some people would go for their ambitions. Like the incompetence of the criminals and how it leads them from one mistake to another, one trouble to another. And innocent people gets involved one after another, because of dumb ideas. However, although this story takes place in a dry and boring snowy town. It's kinda amazing how the Coen brothers could pull off naive and dense characters that are actually still believable, while also entertaining to watch. And when it comes down to it, the mannerisms and the demeanor of the characters is what really drives this movie. And the Coen brothers just nails and makes these awkward characters to be intriguing, because of the random and yet believable decisions they make. This is one of those movies that could have fell flat, but thanks to Coen brothers trademark directions. Thus it's amusing and even intriguing at times, because of the random and yet witty and clever storytelling.

Wade dislikes Jerry, you see. Desperate, he turns to two seedy characters in Fargo, recommended by an auto mechanic, to kidnap his wife, forcing Wade to pay up. The trio will split the proceeds. One of the would-be nappers, Carl (Steve Buscemi) is a non-stop talker with a loose cannon. The other (Peter Stormare) is a blonde menacing giant who says hardly anything. A car from Wade's lot will be the operation vehicle. Almost immediately, there are problems. Huge ones. A highway patrolman pulls the vehicle over, as it still have dealership plates. As Carl starts to reason with the officer, the giant shoots the cop. They drag his body to a ditch. Not only this, a young couple sees the crime from their car and a high speed pursuit ends in their deaths, also. Now, a small city police officer, Marge (Frances McDormand), six months pregnant, must find the perps for these deaths while Wade, frantic, tries to negotiate for the life of his beloved daughter. Meanwhile, Jerry sinks deeper and deeper into lies and deceit. Despite Marge's pregnancy and small town roots, can she solve these crimes? This tantalizing film has a superb plot, careful direction, and an eye and ear for snowy venues and upper Midwest conversation.

The clever plot is a cautionary tale about just how hard pulling off a complex crime would be (unlike most 'caper films', few people in 'Fargo' respond as they were expected to) and the psychological strangulation as the noose tightens around Jerry is palpable.

An amateur crime entrepreneur needs money for some economic venture. He wants it from his father in law who will naturally refuse to give it. So that dear amateur contacts two hooligans who accept to kidnap the amateur's wife, the very daughter of the rich father in law, to get the money as a ransom. Since the man is a car dealer, they want a brand new car and thereafter everything will go wrong. On the way back from the kidnapping with the abducted woman in the back the two hooligans are stopped because they had not registered the car that had a Dealer plate. They kill the state trooper. Two witnesses come by. They are chased and killed. Then the car that was given away has a problem with its registration at the bank or some accounting firm because its serial number is not legible on some listing of sold cars. The father in law decides to deliver the money and he ends up dead, plus a parking lot warden dies too. In the mean time one of the two kidnappers who was taking care of the woman kills her because she is whimpering, and he kills his accomplice when he arrives without the money he has buried in the snow along some cattle fencing, which causes his being killed and then put through a wood-chipper by the first kidnapper. At this moment the pregnant female sheriff from Brainerd who has been investigating the death of the state trooper in the Twin Cities arrives and arrest one kidnapper. During that time the entrepreneurial car dealer is trying to cool it off when the police comes for him. He will end up arrested too. The best Jewish thriller ever produced. When everything turns wrong. The Coen Brothers are perfect witnesses for these flunkies drop-out failing losers who are loose in their brains and disjointed in everything else. It is the Biblical Job but without any divine dimension, without the excuse of being victimized or tested by God. Just one mishap on top of another and the impossibility to stop the sinking process.

""True story"" is a joshing dramatic contraption, obliquely causing us to accept certain elements we might not normally accept so easily. Regardless, Fargo is concordant with the intonations and distinctions of modern small-town life. When Chief Marge Gunderson stands at the first crime scene and counts three dead bodies, she accurately recognizes that the culprits are not from Brainerd. Endeavoring into the city on her inquest, she asks a friend for a tip on a good place to eat, and is guided to the Radisson buffet. Jerry Lundegaard is as boxed in by his sales manager's job and his cruel father-in-law as any inmate in a jail cell. He's shuffling a stolen car and a double fraud. His son hurtles off from the dinner table to meet his friends at McDonald's. His wife toils manically at every domestic chore, chopping, stirring and knitting with as much rapidity as she's capable of. Against these homegrown nuances, the crimes protrude as brutal and barbaric. There are unpleasant parts. Everyone recalls the scene with the wood-chipper. More cold-blooded is the scene where the poor hostage, blindfolded and barefoot, attempts to escape on foot in the snow, and Carl Showalter makes fun of her. There are also the shootings, callous and abrupt. Against this Chief Marge, seven months pregnant, applies cozy small-town buoyancy as a way of ferreting privileged info out of crooks.",

That it all feels so strangely authentic (our auteurs grew up in the area) only makes it even harder to turn away; it's the unimagined point in time and space where Strange Brew meets Reservoir Dogs. Offset by the cordial, affable nature of the general population, this film's frequent forays into spontaneous bloodshed and calculated, if bumbling, barbarism are downright hypnotic. Despite fantastic performances from Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare (the most visceral villains, scumbags with neither principals nor reservations) and William H. Macy (the real monster), the floor belongs to Frances McDormand. She thoroughly owns the screen as police chief Marge Gunderson, a pregnant ball of contradiction whose peachy exterior masks a tough, no-nonsense detective's intellect.

Without a doubt , the best thing about Fargo is the characters . William H Macey , Steve Buscemi and especially Frances McDormand make Fargo the interesting film that it is. I love the way Marge Gunderson acts as if she's so slow , yet it's just the way people are in that part of the country and in fact she's far from stupid. William H Macey plays a man so caught up in debt that he tries to have he's wife kidnapped so he can share the ransom and needless to say things go wrong very quickly.

The story of a car salesman who married the rich boss's daughter and has been squelched in his father-in-law's shadow ever since. His father-in-law holds him in low esteem and never fails to hammer the point. But, one can see why.

Jean the wife has a very rich father so he could pay the ransom. They Kidnapped her like they were supposed to but on the road to the lake house things went wrong. They were pulled over by a police officer because they don't have a plate. At some point the mute had to shoot him and while the funny was carrying his body on the road, the two people in the car driving by saw the whole thing. Then the mute went after them and killed both. After three murders they went to a motel and hired prostitues and then to the lake house. She was wearing a snow mask the whole time. Marge the pregnant police officer was investigating the cases. She showed up at the car shop to question the Indian guy because there were telephone calls between him and the Kidnappers. Jerry pretends everything is ok but seems worried. Then the father in law insists on bringing money on his own instead of his son in law. He shows up at the parking lot. After an altercation the funny guy shot him but also got shot in the face. Bleeding profusely he takes the money takes 80k and buries the rest by the side of the road in the middle of nowhere and puts the ice scraper as a sign. Then he goes to the lake house and jean was killed laying on the floor. The Kidnappers had an argument over money and splitting the car and the mute kills the funny looking. While he was turning his body into ground meat in a wood chopper the police officer Marge finds the lake house and shoots the mute in the leg while he was running away. At the back seat of the police car, they pass by the giant statue and all seems bleak and meaningless as everyone is dead. Then the police finds jerry and arrests him too. Everything becomes even more gloomy and bleak in vast snow capped lands of Minnesota except for Marge and her painter husband talking in bed. It did not feel an old movie despite my worries.

We have a contradicting pair of kidnappers, one a foul-mouthed talker while the other one a calm and silent yet sadistic. On the other side of the story we have the easy-going and spirited policewoman. The acting is quite good that it can take you deep into the story despite all the quirks in the story.

He comes up with the ingenious scheme of having his wife kidnapped for a ransom from his fatherinlaw who is very wealthy and treats his son-in-law as an incompetent. the story takes off from there, twisting and turning in incredible but believable directions, victims dropping like flies. At the core of the movie is pregnant Marge and her painter husband Norm, secure in their domestic bliss.  Marge goes out to solve this multiple homicide fiasco, Norm stays home and paints ducks for a postage stamp competition. Some of the scenes are to be seen to be believed and we are shocked out of complacency at times with some pretty graphic violence, and Marge gets her man in the end and does not hesitate to philosophize in the police car at him.

What makes this movies stand out as a cinematic masterpiece? If someone could enlighten me as to why please do. There were no real dynamic characters, no one I felt sympathy for or any connection to; overall it was not entertaining. The storyline was slow, it dragged on to a conclusion that, frankly just wasn't there. Honestly there were like ten different people killed and I was still bored. Finally, I've seen posts where people seem to flip over the ending, it wasn't deep or thought provoking, it was a dead end to a highly overrated picture. Simply put do not waste your time watching this movie.",

Macy as Jerry Lundegaard, a car dealer obsessed with being wealthy who hires a duo of ruthless criminals Carl Showalter (played by Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grismud (played by Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife Jean and exchange her for a large amount of money by her father. Before too long when the plan goes terribly wrong and turns into a bloodbath, this heinous crime gains the attention of a pregnant police officer Margo Gunderson (played by Frances McDormand) who comes into investigation.

Missing were the car chases, the shootouts and heroes clad in tights and cape. I would have walked away if others had not coaxed me into sitting through this. Am I glad they did. This definitely was not the dud I thought it might have been. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. This potboiler of a murder mystery had me sitting at the edge of my seat from the opening credits. Every scene perfectly introduced...leading the viewer into the next. This is a well crafted story with an outstanding cast. First we have a perfectly shaky and conniving William H. Macy - you just know he is up to no good. Let's face it, this guy has guilty written all over him even when he is completely innocent. And then you've got Marge ""You got Arby's all Over Me"" Gunderson who just happens to be one clever(and unintentionally funny) Chief of Police. She is a natural crime solver, with an analytical mind who is bound and determined to get to the bottom of the crime. I know, I know – it all kind of sounds like a rehash of a rehash of a rehash...it isn't...it gets better. For one thing, ""Fargo"" is so bitterly cold, nature is naturally more angry than normal. On top of the wind, the cold and the snow...you have these two snakes in the grass...well that would actually be snakes in the snow. These two jewels of humanity (played by Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi (awesome firefighter by the way.)) match the horrible weather conditions. These guys have no respect for life. Sounding good so far? Well just wait. The main star of this movie is probably the wood chipper. It has no lines, no dancing skits or no songs...but it does have a few minutes of fame. If you have not seen the movie yetjust think about wood-chipper and the cool things you can do with it. I won't spoil it and go any farther.

It's an odd sort of movie combining gruesome brutality with quirky comedy. It's an original dramatic device. The bad guys are so bad that you need a little relief.

I have become a commonlaw husband to it, and I think I treat my copy of the film better than I will ever treat any woman (if you are a prospective significant other out there, I'm sorry.) This is the film I aspire to someday become fused within, to live with Marge and Norm ""Son of a Gun""derson, or the Lundegaards. This is the movie that made me think of movies as a higher art. THE higher art, I should say. There is never a dull moment in this film, and if you watch it with someone who likes to make talkie during the silences, please kick them in the head, every milli-second of silence is vital. This quiet, every milli-second, is crafted to perfection, and is worth any line of dialogue. Although I must say, the dialogue ain't bad.

And it's absolute quality film making. The Coen Brothers really put their touch on the film. I feel William H. Macy is the best part of this movie. His character is genius. And Macy really gave an awesome performance. McDormand and the 2 thugs are a close second. The cast really shines. Fargo is a true gem. It has depth, details, all the good movie making qualities you need. I feel this is one of the most powerful movies ever made. You almost have to be in the right mood to watch Fargo, because it is so dark, but if you are, it will be one of the best movies you'll ever see.

I don't know how the brothers do it, but they succeeded in the genre of intellectual comedy, sparkling with unsurpassed light burlesque and 'black humor'. Masters of their craft and more! They skillfully inflate the situation arising from human stupidity to a monstrous absurdity so that no one doubts what the 'moral of this fable' is, and in conclusion they sometimes give out a little moralizing, and we do not consider this rudeness, because this is one of the organic components of an individual, prone to caricaturism, handwriting, which can already rightfully be approved as 'Cohen's'.",

The result was fatal at all, his wife and father-in- law killed by the gangsters and he himself discovered and caught finally by the police.

427,3 May 2014,RossRivero99,10, Frances McDormand at her Oscar winning finest,"This movie was a great movie but not only that it is also the best movie of 1996, the movie tells the story about a man named Jerry Lundegaard (played by William H. Macy) whose inept crime ends up falling apart due to his and his henchmen's bungling and the tireless police work of the quite pregnant Marge Gundersen (played by Frances McDormand). Based on a true story the movie itself was a true masterpiece of the police movie genre, in which it compares to Dirty Harry, The French Connection, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, and many more. Director Joel Coen can make a classic out of each and every movie him and his brother Ethan Coen can make together. Frances McDormand gives the best performance of her career in this crime, comedy, thriller, masterpiece. This truly should have won the 1996 Oscar for best picture instead of The English Patient because Fargo required a lot more entertainment than The English Patient did. Also this movie is not only a great movie but it is a Coen brothers classic.",
428,4 March 2003,WriterDave,10, The Ultimate Coen Brothers' Movie and one of the Best Films Period,"Here's the brilliant duality of ""Fargo."" You can watch it as so many claim it is to be intended, as a comedy, and thoroughly enjoy yourself (I especially love when Marge is interrogating the girls from the bar). However, was this really how the film was intended to be viewed? This is an inherent problem with many Coen brothers' films. Their movies are always so lovingly filmed, meticulously crafted, and beautifully photographed, that you are often shocked that they seem to treat their characters and stories with such a light handed and often mocking touch. ""Blood Simple"" and ""Miller's Crossings"" were the dramatic exceptions (no doubt, these are not comedies) and ""Raising Arizona,"" ""The Big Lebowski,"" and ""Oh, Brother Where Art Thou?"" operate at the other end of the spectrum (these are all great comedies). All of their other films fall oddly in between. ",
429,4 December 2019,sabuj-70235,9, Cold,"The first thing that I realized while watching the movie was the environment of the location. I realized, this is a story which is about the darkness of human conscience. Almost every part of the movie was located in frozen Minnesota, which is covered with white snow and under the white earth there is a river of blood. The red is soaked by the snow, just like the human evilness is covered by house, clothes, job etc. Throughout the movie we see no logic and no remorse behind the murders. People dies because of no reason at all and people kill them because of no reason at all. The greatest thing about this movie is the coldness of the characters. We see characters go through the story and nothing changes their greed or the evilness inside them. This is not a movie about good vs evil where in the end goodness will overcome the evil. Because the story is the evil fuel of this movie. Though we see the murderers get caught at the end, still it showed no indication that this was some uncommon or unique story that happens once in a decade. The thing this movie portrays is that, this whole story was some ordinary thing and it was the glimpse of the murders that are done because of greed in this world.",
430,2 April 2005,Eumenides_0,10, Another Brilliant Coen Movie!,"I love the Coens for many things; it is especially for the unique vision and quality they put into their brilliant movies, but it is also for their uncompromising study of the darkest side of Mankind. Ever since they debuted with the superb 'Blood Simple,' the Coens have explored the worst in man's soul and psyche, the horrible things that makes him tick in disturbing ways, the things that leads one to violent, pointless things like kidnapping and murder. 'Fargo' is their darkest movie second only to their disturbing debut. A saving grace this movie has which the other didn't have is basically the dark humour in the right moments to lighten the tension in the air.",

So I finally rented it and watched it. Good movie I would have to say. Frances McDormand and Steve Buscemi have great roles and they were my favorite characters of the film. They brought tons of intensity to the film, especially Buscemi, who I think is a fantastic actor and McDormand's performance was pretty funny with her Minnesota accent. She seemed like a down to earth and kind person in that movie, which I really liked in her role. Peter Stormare and William H. Macy also had good performances too. Overall, good movie to watch on a Sunday night and The Coen bros are great directors and I will be sure pay more attention to their movies. I recommend it.",

I've watched it I think four times and each time am again impressed with its outrageous excellence. If you love inventive camera work, intelligent scoring (Carter Burwell), sharp dialog, and a strong female lead (Frances McDormand, winning the Oscar)--and are not put off by occasional violence--then Fargo is well worth seeing (in fact, worth buying!). Just one thing: Take the ""true story"" tag with a grain of salt. Apparently the Coens were having some fun with that declaration!",

Fargo has given me the inspiration I've been lacking to deepen my relationship with their films. The 1996 crime drama was a fun descent into their take on a ""true crime"" story. Weaving the tale of an inept crime organizer, trying to make his wife better by having his wife kidnapped for ransom money paid by his father-in-law, Fargo captures what it means to live in a town small enough to induce claustrophobia, and how suffocating an unfulfilled life truly is. Starring William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, and Frances McDormand, Fargo remains an audience favorite from the Coen brothers even 20 years after its release.",

To me, Macy makes this film a whole lot better than it should be. To me, it's a very basic plot with an overall average acting performance bar the unbeatable Mr. Macy. Frances McDormand got an oscar for her performance. I couldn't believe this after watching the film because to me she comes across as a very dim-witted talentless actress. Of course, a lot of people would say that was what her character's personality was like, but to me, I see her as not a dimwitted character, but as a poor actress who is failing to make a connection with me.

The Coens seem not to have enjoyed growing up in Scandinavian America, and have taken revenge on the place. Is it populated almost entirely by dolts, scammers, thugs, bullies, hookers, wimps and so on ? According to the extra feature ""Minnesota Nice"" there is an underlying feeling that ""polite cultures are the most repressed and therefore the most violent"".

At first, I did think the whole accent thing was overdone, but that's not what irritated me the most. I thought that this film was going to be MUCH better than what it was. Normally, I like their movies (Big Lebowski, Raising Arizona, Miller's Crossing, The Man Who Wasn't There). This one left me flat &, well, irritated.

They capture the dreary scenery of this winter plain-land flawlessly mix the dark humor with a pretty violent story, all the while keeping their tongue firmly planted in their cheek. It pokes fun at these characters and their lifestyle while also creating a magnificent story out of them. You can see that the Coens truly loved these people and put dedication into creating this world (that was inspired by their actual life in Minnesota) and had a lot of fun mocking it all while paying tribute to this sort of sub-culture. The score and cinematography are easily some of the best I've ever seen (as is the film). It's also creepy how much I relate to Gaear Grimsrud. I feel like we have so much in common and were I in his situation I would act the same way. He also managed to draw the most laughs out of me.

How this movies being ranked at 8.6 shows me there are a lot of people that have no idea what a good movie is.

They know how to create memorable characters, quirky dialouge, dark qualities, and fresh laugh-out-loud one-liners.

Cuz now we know that the Upper Midwest is populated with regular people, who are not painfully cute in their snowsuits. In fact, audiences moved to penguins, who don't even have to wear snowsuits. As time has gone by we have also grasped the range of William (Pleasantville) Macy. He's gone on to better things. But the caricatures and gruesome psychosis juxtaposed with inept human greed and self-centered myopia---ah! it is a diversion. And it is very agreeable to watch Frances McDormand work. The Coens seem to have gone in, done their job and pulled out. A directorial road movie in which the repetitive snowy road goes through mood changes--same road, but the story has altered its meaning. At the end, it's comfortingly familiar. I feel the skeleton of a better movie here. Like Peter Jackson's animated bugs in ""King Kong"", the smiling heads of quickly daubed ""local color"" wouldn't be missed. There's good stuff, and it's just off the road a bit, that beautiful straight, snowy road.",

487,8 May 2020,zeekwunlau,8, Cold will,"The runaway and ""cold"" that the Cohen brothers want are in place
The protagonist's motivation is a little problem. He is obviously a man suffering from society. How can his IQ keep up with the kidnapping of Chinese elementary school students who played a self-directed kidnapping. Fortunately, the IQ is consistent and the hairstyle and performance are very small.
It is out of control rather than accident because of the difference in expression. The difference between ""accident"" and ""out of control"" is reflected in the degree of control. It's an accident that the bird droppings hit you on the head. After the same thing happened several times, you decided to prank your friends, but it hit you on the head again. This is out of control.
The angle of the Cohen brothers is mainly based on the role, and the natural loss of control is a more accurate description. The accident in the ""Death is Here"" series has reached such an extent that you can feel that it is nothing to do with design and accident. In the end, I just want to see how the character dies instead of ""Ah, life is really precious, I want to live a good life."" ""Blood Storm"" does not have such a strong sense of artificial design, naturally you can start to sigh the greatness or ordinaryness of life.
""cold""
""Aha"" and too many seemingly embarrassing and alienating scenes are not actually to make you feel humorous or bored, but to make you feel as cold as the ice and snow outside the window, and the relationship is cold. The relationship of all the characters does not involve the emotions we think of in nature but is external, including the ending, the sudden warmth, which does not dispel the coldness, at most it can be warmer than drilling.
Whether life is dominated or designed is not a question that the movie can answer.",

It's ideal to do a movie about a crime that goes horribly wrong due to lousy criminals, but make it a comedy or something. The attack on Asian-Americans is also not good. This was supposed to be the real deal crime drama type, but these people were so pathetic that I couldn't bear to watch them.

Fargo has a perfect run time it never drags for a single second yet everything is wrapped up perfectly in the relatively short run time. I really thought that the accents in this film were going to get on my nerves after a while but they didn't it fit perfectly with the characters and its actually another thing that makes this film so unique. From scene one William H Macy impressed my he was just so perfect at being a pathetic and slimy human being and while you don't ever side with what he's trying to do you kind off in a way sympathise with him because of all the hardships he's has and absolutely earned his Oscar nomination. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare were both fantastic in this film I thought they bounced of each other perfectly and created for some really entertaining dialogue scenes between the two. The whole plot of the kidnapping gone wrong was exhilarating seeing all the characters trying to avoid the law and getting caught hiding evidence and double crossing each other made for some great tension and gave this film its entertainment value but the thing I absolutely hated about this film was the character of Marge Gunderson. She stopped this movie from being perfect, don't get me wrong I thought that Frances McDormand was great in this film but the character was just so annoying her interaction with her husband was awkward and annoying to watch and at the bare minimum it just wasn't as interesting as the kidnapping plot. She just didn't need to be in this movie and it really held this film back for me.

Sure there's a lot of conflict, but it doesn't shock or grab the viewers attention. So the Coen brothers decided to fill it to the brim with an excellent script and very sharp performances. And it worked. Fargo succeeds in nearly all levels of film, the direction, the writing, the acting. Frances Mcdormand won an Oscar for her portrayal as a small time cop, her performance is both sweet and effective, utter perfection too. William H. Macy lost to Cuba Gooding Jr. but I strongly felt Macy deserved it. Every little detail on his face is so perfectly acted out, you know this character and feel him. Steve Buscemi is good here, but isn't exactly oscarworthy. The script keeps a tight net on all characters, and the direction was good too. The only real flaw with Fargo is that some scenes feel out of place and the acting sometimes falls apart. It's rated R because there are a couple of heavy sex scenes, quite a bit of graphic violence, and some swearing. The only reason I give it this score is because of personal choice. 9.5/10",

It happens in comedies, romance movies, well, even cartoons. But not this movie. Suddenly something happens, but it is absolutely NO use for the rest of the movie. There is no change whatsoever. The movie just keeps on running for the last 45 minutes before you think ""Pheww.. Now I don't have to more of this..""

568,16 December 2006,middleburg,10, Darn Tootin'!!!,"""Fargo"" has another character - that North Midwestern accent, with its Scandinavian lilt, its folksy charm and its disarming presence in practically every scene in the movie. This film is a hoot! I agree completely with Ebert's beautiful review. It is fascinating, heartfelt, true to character, place and situation, extremely funny, and sometimes painfully violent. I would only add that as an entertainment, it is one of the most disorienting experiences a viewer can find in the cinema. It is fascinating to watch this film back-to-back with the Coen Brothers' ""Blood Simple"", a great film in its own right, but which seems like the preparation for their masterpiece, ""Fargo"". The tension is almost unrelieved in ""Blood Simple"". But the ending violence is so over-the-top, that the viewer suddenly realizes that they are really being sneakily had by the filmmakers and that the joke is on them. In ""Fargo"", the tension is also unrelieved. But here the film starts with the audience being ""in"" on the outrageousness of the events and the almost cartoon-like characters with their outrageous accents. But still we don't know sometimes whether to laugh or feel chilled (with the events AND that bleak Minnesota winter!) ",
569,8 March 2018,tylerduswalt,10, The Coen Brothers at their Best,"Fargo is a product of the Coen brothers at their best. It claims to be a true story, although it is very loosely based on an actual crime, and the claim is more of a way for the Coen brothers to present their film with a tongue-in-cheek forewarning that the absurdity you are about to witness is entirely factual. The film's tagline is ""a homespun murder story,"" yet the film has much more merit and value to it than this humble statement suggests. Comprised of a network of simpletons way in over their heads in what was supposed to be a relatively victimless crime, Fargo's claim to be unsophisticated speaks more to the incompetence of those involved in the staged kidnapping of Jean Lundegaard than the film itself. The movie seamlessly blends excessive violence, dark humor, apathy, satire, sadism, copious snow, Minnesota accents, and more without misstepping. This is a testament to the film's incredibly high quality: incorporating these elements and striking a balance in them is certainly a difficult task. Joel and Ethan Coen took extraordinary risks to translate their vision to screen, and their bold decisions certainly paid off.
Jerry Lundegaard, a car salesman with an increasingly apparent lack of empathy, begins as our protagonist. He's played by William H. Macy, who perfectly portrays an afraid man who constantly tries to worm his way out of situations created by an ill-thought out plan. Jerry only wants the ""ransom"" money without any trouble, but as murders begin popping all over the map up by the hands of Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare), starting due to Carl's lack of tags on the tan Sierra, there is a shift in who steps into the role of protagonist: Marge Gunderson, a chief officer late in her pregnancy played by Frances McDormand. What makes McDormand's character so enticing, besides her oscar-winning performance, is how she's against people and motives she doesn't understand. After the shocking wood-chipper scene, she handcuffs Gaear and begs the question: how can a man give up the rest of his life and take away so many others' lives for a bit of money? Materialism is a common theme here, as it is what triggers this disastrous series of events. We see Jerry lie both in and out of the workplace, and, whether his words are directed to a customer or his loved ones, they always sound like a sales pitch with a hint of desperation. As the scheme becomes more convoluted and things become traceable to him, he finds it harder to bide his time.
 A part of what makes this movie so original is how it uses humor to bring light to a very dark ordeal. Minnesota accents aside, the Coen brothers create hilarious exchanges between simple folk so that there's a ""yer dern tootin'"" or an ""aw heck"" for every killing at the hands of Stormare's expressionless mute or Buscemi's inept loudmouth. You are allowed to laugh at the misfortune because the film is essentially as unsympathetic as its characters. It's hard to refrain from finding someone like Carl and his spewing frustration hilarious, despite his and Gaear's awful deeds. The dialogue is perfectly tailored to the setting and to each person, and you'll find that remarks are often repeated in scenes, getting only funnier each time (""we're not a bank, Jerry;"" ""he's kinda funny lookin'""). Characters discuss the best buffets around, pancakes, homicide, loneliness, and faxes, all complemented by a gorgeous soundtrack and backdrop filled with a plethora of snow and tire tracks. No character is without value to the film (even Mike Yanagita, who helps Margie realize Jerry may be lying to her); Norm Gunderson is a shining example of the 3-cent stamp whose purpose is to keep the 29-cent stamp balanced, happy, and thriving. Fargo is in master-class territory, a film begging for its viewers to find themselves past that Paul Bunyan statue once again to revisit its snowy, violent, simple offerings, and I couldn't recommend it more to any appreciative moviegoer.",
570,11 March 1999,Film Dog,10, An OKay movie.,"Good, but not as good as Siskel & Ebert thought (they both picked it as favorite film of '96).  A sleazy car salesman wants his wife kidnapped so he can extort ransom from her father, but plans go awry.  Frances McDormand steals the show as a pregnant Brainerd police chief.

Pulp Fiction is a thriller that we could compare, an id rather watch that most times.

I've never seen a more boorish person: he never talks, but on the other hand his gun is always in action, and he's particularly cruel with his victims. Luckily there's Marge, the firm and REALLY funny pregnant policewoman played by the wonderful Frances McDormand: she deserved every prize she won and was nominated for.

591,28 March 2007,cocojaen85,10, Marvelous a 10/10,"I saw Fargo when I was 13 back in 1997. Taking into account my age, watching it could not have been the smartest thing to do. Anyways I've seen it multiple times in the past 10 years. Last night I saw it again and I remembered why I think this a marvelous masterpiece. It is probably one of the best movies of the nineties (and probably one of the best of all time). While I was viewing it, I started to (re) notice what great acting. Macy's character is just a poor scumbag, a loser, a desperate (very stupid) man. He's a failure and Macy's portrays this with brilliance. Frances McDormand's accent will be stuck with me forever, she's just inspirational. Her performance of a Small town police chief is just amazing. The way she moves and talks, her pregnancy that somehow makes you think she's vulnerable, but turns out to be a very intelligent strong woman.We saw a beautiful character, one of those characters that will defeat time (like Vito Corleone, Guido from 8 1/2 or Death form the Seventh Seal, among others of course). The two stupid and completely caricaturesc ""hit-men"". Buscemi and Stormare are on of those ""odd-couples"" that entertain even when they're killing almost for fun. As an example when they get to the cabin and Lundeergard's wife tries to flee blindfolded, Buscemis laughter is so sarcastic with Stormare's stare looking as she falls down. It's a magnificent scene of two criminals with no humanity, no respect, real bastards, and we laugh as they do. Those long scene of snow and snow and snow. We literally get immersed in this nothingness, the same nothingness that everyone has in it'soul and mind in the film, exception would be Marge's marriage. Before To begin closing this commentary, I've always liked the music, I think it's also brilliant. So depressive, so tragic, a great enhancer for every scene. The Cohen brothers created a masterpiece and they (alongside the actors) are to blame. Beautiful photography, great directing and a script that contains amazing dialogue makes this movie perfect. That dark humor of the Cohen brothers, gives you a relief as you see people that are decadent and selfish (but most certainly stupid like the 2 criminals or Lundeergard) create schemes and plans to get money, as if money was what you need the most in life. Marge has everything this sick people want, she has a life, a persona, she is intelligent, deductive, full of love for her husband and a baby. To connect this 2 last paragraphs, at the end Marge states (while driving Stormare): ""for what? (talking about all the dead people) For a little bit of money. There's more to life than a little money, you know. Don't you know that? And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day. Well, I just don't understand it."" That last line could've been said by Garcia Marquez or Shakespeare. She says ""and it's a beautiful day"" while all we see is snow, and a lonely depressive background, ""I just don't understand"" she says next. Of course she can't, she can see beauty on a depressive scenery and she has the humanity everyone else lacks off.",

I didn't really know any of the actors by name, although many I do recognise visually and that probably helped me keep an open mind. If Meryl Streep played the lead then somehow I would have expected something specific, but in this case what emerged from my TV was a real curiosity and a darkly charming one! It's an apparently serious film but laced with some wickedly dark comedy and tongue-in-cheek sequences. The characters are great,they have depth and human interest, even the silent hit man! The acting is naturalistic and deadpan, the casting is spot-on perfect. Despite several huge shocks along the way the fairly simple and uncomplicated plot moves quickly and effortlessly to a rather satisfactory conclusion.In many ways thats a surprise in itself and yet at no time is this a flashy or overboard piece of movie making,it's restrained and controlled, and all the better for it.And it's great entertainment. A credit to all involved. The opening shot of a car approaching in a near white-out sets up the snow-bound feel of the movie. The bleak, frozen wastes of Minnesota have a slightly other-worldy aura about them which adds immeasurabley to the overall atmosphere. The towns of Fargo and Brainard in winter seem like frontier outposts and the action which follows has a strong Western overtones. Frances McDormand is quite brilliant as the pregnant local police chief, Marge, with a home-life so prosaic and a delivery so earnest that you swear you must have met this woman somewhere yourself! Her ability to be funny without apparently trying is such a refreshing change from the ""Friends"" style of comedy (say your line, pull a face and wait for the laugh before resuming)that now riddles Hollywood. And her dialogue is brilliantly written. The peculiarities of the Minnesota accent where it seems everyone has a Scandinavian name and says ""oh yahh"" are played to the hilt (sorry to any residents reading this if I sell your state short, I'm from England so please forgive my lack of background knowledge). The scene in which Marge interviews two hookers amid a chorus of ""ohh yahhh""s is hilarious. Only one thing in the script annoyed me, the constant and repeated reference by one character to another by their names. How many times did the Brainard cop, who discovers the initial dead bodies, call his chief ""Margie"" ? In Every single line, virtually. That was the only flaw. In real life people on familiar everyday terms don't keep using each other's names in that way. It's a trick straight out of bad soap-opera where the idea is to make the viewer remember who everyone amid the cast of hundreds actually is. Otherwise this was a brilliantly written, acted, directed and photographed movie. If you havn't seen it, rest assured it's not at all what you are expecting!",

William H. Macy plays Jerry Lundegaard, a man in a spot. He's a used car salesman that has been securing loans for cars that are not really in his lot. The bank is calling in the loans, threatening legal action, and he needs money fast. He forms a plan to have his own wife kidnapped, thereby splitting the ransom money between himself and the kidnappers. It's a terrible plan, and it quickly unravels into a bloody mess of murder and betrayal. When bodies begin to mount, a local police officer, Marge Gunderson, is called in.

A Nineties indie product to its core, ""Fargo"" mixes noir with comedy, placing atrocious violence in a comforting Midwest setting.

It's something that can be easy to miss if you don't have a dark sense of humor, which makes it all the more interesting. The characters are unforgettable and the cinematography is beautifully done.

But the setting of the sleepy midwestern towns in the beautiful snow and the film's humble tone make this one of the more interesting dramas to watch. Don't take that like it's devoid of action though, Fargo is interspersed with some surprisingly tense and hilarious moments. It just has a more microscopic lens on the characters of the story and the culture of their town. It also has an excellent soundtrack that fits the film perfectly and even adds to that comforting feeling I mentioned. I do think maybe it wraps up in a faster fashion than I was hoping, definitely the movie comes more alive when Frances McDormand's character steps in and I feel a few scenes from the first quarter could have been shaved down to include more finality for the plot. But as it is the film moves at a quick enough pace throughout where this doesn't bother me too much, it's just a bit unfortunate. Still very solid.",

613,30 December 2004,ericolsen1953,10, Beautiful illustration of the absence of intelligence in criminals,"Evil is interesting. Fargo shows us, in stark terms, the futility of trying to pull of the Perfect Crime. If you study The Darwin Awards or DumbCriminalActs.com, you find that the criminal mind is so arrogant as to think that nothing can go wrong with their ""well-laid"" plans. And, when an auto sales-manager who thinks his manhood rests solely in how much money he makes, sets out to commit the first violent act of his life, we get a good insight into how everything can go wrong and WILL go wrong. Jerry's plot to kidnap his wife thru surrogates, thwart his father-in-law's overbearing personality, lie to his confederates about the size of the ransom demand and then profit in six-figures all comes to nothing, with a trail of dead bodies that don't immediately point to the real culprit. We learn that Jerry is no smarter or deliberate than any other felon in the big house when we spy him trying to fool GMAC about selling some non-existent cars, then trying to pocket the loan dollars. Jerry's evidently been in the trade awhile and knows better, but he's confident that he can put one over on those dopes at who loan money for a living'(not bloody likely). Now that the GMAC plot is failing, he goes ahead with a much more ambitious and dangerous scheme and let's the petty crooks he met abduct his wife from her home. We wonder if, left alone awhile longer, Jerry might feign madness and machine-gun everyone he knows in order to cover up his earlier sins. It's the honest, steady people in this wicked world who make a positive, lasting contribution to life as we know it. They're represented by Police Chief Margie Gunderson, her loving husband Norm, as well as her local cops, the bartender at the Moose Lodge, etc. My grandparents are all from Fargo & Bismark, and I'm glad that someone finally made a movie where everyone TALKS NORMAL.",

The film gives us a good look at Steve Buscemi, but Frances McDormand simply IS the movie. Without this sweet, soft-spoken and quite pregnant protagonist with an accent all too germane for that part of the US (and well done, too !), this story would go nowhere in a hurry.  She is to this film what Gloria Stuart is to ''Titanic''.  It took a lot to win-out over the heavy-duty competition in ''Secrets & Lies'', but McDormand took home the Oscar (''Best Actress'').

The acting was so believable enough that I thought that they were actually from Minnesota.  On the other hand, the film is kind of predictable and you might know what kind of ending it will have just by watching half of the movie. Also, the only character that I cared about through the entire film was Marge (the policewoman) the other characters I didn't care whether they died or not, I guess that says a lot about the film.  Also, I think they should have cut a few parts of the movie since they don't have anything to do with the main story; but I suppose they put it there just to be funny.  I'm totally surprised that this film went up all the way to 76 in the rankings.

The acting is top notch as well, most notably by Buscemi and McDormand, although the rest of the cast is great as well. The thing that elevates this movie above most others I think, is how smoothly it alternates between the comic and the tragic. The dialogue is filled with great comic moments only to all of a sudden shift to a dark and gruesome scene and then right back to the comic.

634,29 December 2010,olie2008,10, Perhaps the most bizarre and absurd films you'll ever see. For me that's a guarantee you'll love it.,"Finally breaking through into 'mainstream' audiences, the Coen Brothers skillfully woven comedy, Fargo, tells the tale of a man's desperate attempt to bring himself out of the severe financial problems he has encountered. Jerry Lundergard, played by William H. Macy, decides that the best way to fix this problem his to have his wife abducted and his father in law to pay the ransom. However, as with all Coen Films, not all goes to plan. Directly from the beginning we are made aware that Jerry's decision to hire two criminals, characterised by their lack of agreement on anything, will result in dire consequences. As the film draws to it's end, we're left with the dead bodies of Jerry's wife, her Father, a Police Officer, two witnesses and one of the two would-be criminals. For me though, it's not the story, although written beautifully by both Coens, but the performances of Frances McDormand, William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi; all three of which have yet to have been bested. Fargo tells not only of the tale and ultimate downfall of greed, but also the fantastic quirky story of Marge Olmstead-Gunderson (Frances McDormand)in her quest to both catch the two criminals and her husbands stamp interest. Surely one of the best films of the nineties if not of all time.",

Part of the greatness of this story is that it grows out of the location and characters where the authors grew up, around Fargo, South Dakota. The characters are another important part, because not only are they interesting people, but they represent a cross-section of common attitudes about justice. Jerry sees justice in terms of financial and personal advantages. Gaear understands justice as always doing what is necessary to survive, given his criminal life style.

McDormand definitely deserves her Oscar, although it's a bit tragic that Macy didn't get one, since he gives the better performance (although I emphasize that both performances are spectacular). The film also presents an interesting contrast, with complications, violence, and sin on one side, and simple folksy down-home humanity on the other. It is this contrast that makes ""Fargo"" difficult to categorize. Crime plays a central role in the story and yet it's not a crime story, thriller, or mystery. The scenes with Frances McDormand are laugh-out-loud hilarious (and she is a true master of the art of awkward smiles for awkward moments), and yet the film is not a comedy (not even a black comedy).

When the man in the car coldly blasted a state trooper in the face with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol, I almost quit watching right there. Then, the man pursued, and killed two witnesses by shooting one in the head at close range, the other in the back.",

655,10 January 2014,SDAim,10, Best movie ever. Endastory.,"You either get Fargo or you don't. I have a friend who now thinks I like ""quirky"" movies and has recommended some not-great films, since she really didn't understand why this film struck such a chord with me.",
656,23 October 2011,thepsychocritic,8, In the words of Ebert: 'Films like Fargo are why I love the movies.',"It's a pity, really. Movies having a cast of relative unknowns of the industry, which make up for their lack of publicity with a superb storyline more often than not remain buried it the DVD archives titled 'no one cares' while films starring the big-wigs, with their six-packs or saving the world antics sell like reindeer training manuals in Antartica. Unfortunately, Fargo falls dead-centre in the former neglected category, which made the satisfaction of successfully excavating for it equivalent to finding a brick of pure gold. ",
657,12 March 2008,shafatqadri,10, Compelling!!!!!!!!! Cannot avoid it.........,How do I even begin to review a film that has been in my personal Top 20 of all time. 'Fargo' is like many Coen brothers films: the story of a stupid crime gone horribly wrong. You can relate it to their Oscar winning film this year 'No COuntry for Old Men' in some ways.,
658,9 May 2010,mammigirl,7, Fargo,Fargo is a dark comedy that was directed by the Coen Brothers. This movie is basically about one harmless event that Jerry Lundegaard plans out to get money. He wants his wife kidnapped by two guys because hes to afraid to ask his father in law. Jerry's little idea to get money ends up becoming bigger then he could imagine. Innocent individuals end up getting killed along the way in this small town of Minnesota. In the end Jerry loses everything that was important to him just to get some money. This movie shows the audience that people will think of any ways to get money even though he never meant for anyone to get hurt. I thought this movie was an okay movie.,
659,5 May 2010,oconnor0930,10," Awesome movie, ya?","'Fargo' is a refreshing film. The audience is thrust into this spoof of a crime movie, full of goofy accents and eccentric characters—which are oddly spot on to people in real life when you think about it.",

661,27 July 2007,r_ende,5, The worst dialogues I have ever seen in a film!,"I have just seen ""Fargo"" and I must say that I was a bit disappointed. The first twenty minutes of this movie were very thrilling and promising. But then the film became weaker and weaker. Especially some dialogues are just horrible! Sometimes I asked myself, whether it was a thriller or a film for children learning English. The plot became boring, uninteresting and daft and all suspense went gone! The actors were quite good, the music could have been more diversified. All in all the film is not bad but the dialogues and the many deviations weaken the movie's quality a lot! It's a pity, the movie could have been much better!",
662,31 December 1998,Mark-201,10, A little kidnapping goes horribly wrong in the friendly Midwest.,"Fargo is easily one of the ten best films of all time.  The acting is great, especially by Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, and William H Macy. Watching the events of a seemingly small time kidnapping turn into a multiple murder is an enjoyable experience in this film.  You almost feel sorry for Buscemi, who just wanted his $40,000 but ends up killing all these people.  It is also funny to watch him be so out of place among the hospitable Midwesterners.  The whole film is a fun experience.",
663,21 June 2008,from_christmas_past,8, Classic Coen,"A powerful story can be a source for a great movie. However, in the hands of a great director, a powerful story can be elevated to a masterpiece. Without any doubt, Fargo is a director's movie, for the most memorable things about the movie are the little idiosyncrasies. There is an undercurrent of humor throughout the movie that brilliantly contrasts with the moroseness of the story. The movie, like most of Coen brothers' movies, has over-the-top acting performances that keeps the movie interesting. This is typical of how Coens approach most of their movies and if you have a taste for it, this movie is a treat. In short, a intriguing story peppered throughout with trademark humor and noteworthy performances makes for very entertaining watch. Also, the background score is great. You could read a lot more into the movie, but even if you do not, it still remains extremely entertaining.",
664,19 May 2020,jonnyscrimgour,8, Fargo,What I liked: It's quite a moral study. The main thing I got from it was that actions have consequences and you're rewarded in life by the way you treat others. The Coen's have a really great understanding and control of their characters. I found it entertaining throughout and any film that is 1hr30 long is a great film in my book. I love Frances McDormand in this and just in general I think she's a great actress. I also love how the North Dakotan setting was one of the main characters.,
665,30 July 2003,PSYCHOAD,10, great black comedy,the film starts off with jerry with is a car salesman with needs money and father in law is very rich so he gets two dum thugs to kidnap her one who never shuts up and the other who never speaks but it all goes wrong when the two kill 3 people and now the police are on they back. very well black comedy thriller by the coen brothers i am now waiting for millers crossing to come out on dvd 9/10,

668,11 May 2010,bruscinoa833,7, Fargo,"I have only seen one other Coen Brothers film but after seeing it I am definitely intrigued and am going to see many more. The combination of comedy and crime was just perfect in this film, the directors balanced the comedy, violence and suspense very well. The movie was not predictable so while I had some idea of what might be coming up next, I was completely sure and it kept me entertained for the duration of the film. The acting done by the whole cast was great each character was extraordinarily normal. The each had their own oddities but also seemed like people that you might run into in your own town. This aided in the comedy relief which was necessary at certain point especially during the wood chipper scene. while it was quite alarming there was one moment that changed the whole scene. Frances McDormand's character is yelling to the man stuffing the body into the wood chipper and when he does look up she point to her hat with expression of shock that the man could be so dumb as to continue after he had noticed her. The camera work also captured my attention. The shots that panned across the desolate landscapes really gave me the feeling of being there. The sudden zooming on character's faces during pivotal scenes sucked me right into the movie and allowed to me to feel what they were feeling. I did not expect too much from this film at first but it really surprised me, I thought it was very well done.",
669,10 May 2010,j-schardt,7, good film,"This was one of the first Coen brother film I had seen and now want to see more. They did a great job verisimilitude or making everything seem real. When the bar owner shoveling his drive way has the conversation with the cop, I could have swore that neither of them were actors and there just happened to be a camera there. The film has a very simple vibe where nothing dramatic ever happens that often yet when it does happen it makes it that more dramatic which may sound silly and obvious but if you watch the film you'll get what I'm saying. The film has the wonderful mid-west vibe to it which the over exacerbated accents really add too. It adds this great humor to the film which really helps you get through all the slower more informative parts of the film. Not only that but the story it self is all over the place leaving you thinking there no way this simple pregnant women can solve this murder. Yet when it all come together for her you get to really see how she just slowly but surely figure out every little detail to the case. Then they add mystery too it because they never even address the money once the only character who knew it was there died. Great acting, great plot, great story and all the other things I address's add up to make this one of my all time favorite films.",

676,14 May 2010,bellsa037,7, Fargo,"I feel nobody is smart in this movie. It is different from the crime movies that I have been watched. Normally, they usually have the main character who are smart and fight with bad people. I think the director tries to make the movie is funny by using stupid manner of characters. However, many scenes are cruel, especially the scene that the man kills the police, and many scenes are unpredictable; for example, the scene that kidnapper looks through the window and breaks it out and comes to the house to kidnap. In addition, there is an example of overlapping sound in the scene that the man tries to fix the television. In that scene while the man is fixing the television, the camera is zooming in, and when the television is good, the camera zoom out, but it becomes the different place.",
677,24 January 1999,Castor-10,10, Fargo has already made its place as an american classic,"Fargo is one of those films that becomes an instant classic.  Pulp Fiction is the only other one that really hits the mind as another recent film to become so famous.  The truth is if you don't like it then you just totally missed the point.  There is a lot of humor involved in it that you probably won't laugh at until around the 3rd or 4th time you see it, not to mention how often you'll quote it after that.  Fargo is simply an original masterpiece and for those of you who actually insult little things about it... o.k. that proves how incredibly stupid you are and unless you can whip out a film degree I think it's best to just shut the hell up, this is a very entertaining movie that is nearly flawless.",
678,4 February 2009,dingin77,10, Hell's Fargo,"This movie (so far the Coen Bros. best effort) is all about face: Bill Macy's malleable mug, Frances McDormand's expressionless countenance and Steve Buscemi's gunshot gizzard.",
679,6 May 2010,B-Seide24,8, Coen Brothers at its best,"The Coen Brothers go along way to catch the essence of what life is like in a town without much crime or power. The acting is flawless with Frances Mcdormand leading the way as a pregnant police chief who is smart enough to see that something out of the ordinary is happening in the country parts of Minnesota. The whole way that the Coen's had Mcdormand and her partner access the murders and go about finding out more about it is absolutely hysterical. I am from Minnesota and many of the characters sounded a lot like the cousins and grandparents I have in the country in Minnesota. The ""you betchas"" and other lines are key to the realism of the film. I truly appreciate the most important part of the film though. The versimilitude and the ability of the Coen Brothers to go to extreme lengths just to show you, that in life in order to be happy and satisfied sometimes you just have to be grateful for what you have. That is why the downfall of the car salesman played by William H. Macy is so disturbing because all he had to do was ask for help and be grateful for the family that was left for him at home. The atmosphere and the depth of shots to show you the wilderness of Minnesota is breathtaking and at times you can almost feel the breeze of the cold Minnesota winter as the movie carries from scene to scene. Overall, this was one hell of a Coen Brothers film and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys dark American comedy.",
680,3 January 2005,avito,8, what I like of this picture,"I love this one ! especially the landscape during the titles presentation: a different, fantastic world, yet so full of premonition; and how the hard to believe, hard to imagine, violence and light-hearted blood shed is treated; you can think that it is so exaggerated that you can refuse it and find it comic, as I did for instance when the red sock covered foot of the wife emerges from the meat-chopper: in a second moment you can also realize that all this happens everyday in our world; and what I won't forget is the character and the acting of Frances McDormand, even if I don't know how to define her: calm, peaceful, self assured, down-to-earth, matter of fact, I believe you until I discover a lie, you will not escape; everything perfect for a pregnant wife-sheriff.",

687,28 August 2007,ed_zeppelin,8, Very nearly a darn toot'n' classic...but not quite,"Tarantino without the fractured narrative. Fargo is the kind of film that people call ""quirky"", which is ironic in the light of its opening claim to being a true story  I had my suspicions the instant it said that the events were portrayed exactly as they happened, a tall order for any film. While I think it's flawed in places, it's still an extraordinary peep into an enclosed environment; while some films like to point out small-town suburbia as a front for some seriously freaky goings on, the great strength of Fargo is that it undermines that sense of juxtaposition; it deals with life in a sleepy town and an investigation into a series of brutal murders without really presenting any major difference between them.",
688,9 May 2006,LuckyGraveyardBoots,7," lightweight tragicomedy, but good fun","I had a great time watching this movie. I haven't laughed like that in front of the TV for ages. But...once it was over, it was over. In my opinion, it's really over-hyped - it's the story of Jeff (William H. Macy) who is in deep financial trouble...so he pays some small-time crooks (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife for part of a ransom he will extract from his wife's rich father. When the deed is done and the crooks are hauling Mrs. Jeff to their hideout, a cop stops them for not having the right tab on their car, and is shot. Uh-oh, two innocent bystanders noticed! Boom-boom, dead too. About four or five other people have gone to Jesus by the end, and the movie centers around Marge (Frances McDormand), the Fargo police chief trying to track down the killers. Her performance was actually pretty good as a sensitive woman who is intentionally oblivious, refusing to let the horrible things she must witness seep in and bring her down. Since Steve Buscemi is here too, you can predict the tone of the comedy, which is very dryly hilarious - the point of the movie is to contrast tragedy with comedy for a haunting and bittersweet ending. An interesting idea, but the tragedy wasn't tragic enough, it was disaffected in an odd way. Normally gruesome scenes are trivialized in a way that I don't like. It would have been very powerful had you just felt a bit more for the characters. As was, it was slightly off-kilter and I felt it left you with nothing. Great fun, however.",

I gave it a 6 anyway, because it was yet interesting, in particular for dialogues and characters. There was an eerie atmosphere, too. But the balance between noir and comedy resulted in a tie, with no spectaculars... Of course a movie may have a complex order, but it always needs an order.

They are geniuses in filmmaking, with entertaining films with good stories and great actors. And the acting is really one of the strong sides about this film. Steve Buscemi, in my opinion the coolest actor alive, and Peter Stormare is brilliant. Totally exceptional. Frances McDormand is a little over-rated though but does give a good performance. William H. Macy is, as always, good as the car sales-man in money trouble. The film is about Jerry Lundegaard that needs money. His wife's rich father won't give it to him so he plans a scam. He hires two criminals, to kidnap his wife, and ask for a big amount of money to give her back. then her father will have to pay and the criminals will get their share of the money Jerry his.

Deplore, if you like, those movies which seek to portray violence for its own sake, or for titillation, or for money; but know that ""Fargo"" is not one of these. Rather it has the feel of a Medieval morality play (with a Medieval style musical score, if you needed a hint), wherein the evil-doers suffer the consequences of their actions, and those consequences occur on more levels than meet the eye.",

701,22 July 2003,famsmith,9, A Hero with a Heart,"Fargo comes with the works.  A wonderfully original and quirky script by Joel and Ethan Cohen which at the same time is more accessible, sensible, and down to earth than any one of their other films.  Fargo is not a cult classic it is a mainstream triumph.  With precise and vivid photography by Roger Deakins (The Shawshank Redemption, Kundun, Dinner With Friends, The Hurricane and numerous Cohen brothers' films).  Great performances from Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy.  And relatively unique editing that was actually written into the script, at times the Cohen brothers employ hard cuts to black which breaks up the rhythm and extraordinarily makes you think.  However, it is really Frances McDormand's performance that gives this film its strength.  In my opinion a strange thing has happened with Fargo.  From time to time there is a film that is a great film, but catches on for the wrong reasons.  Many people talked about Fargo as a comedy which it certainly was not despite a comic touch that exists throughout the Cohen brtohers' work.  Others went around acting like fools saying ya, oh ya, you bet, and real good then, as if the unusual accents were what made the film distinctive.  What makes this film brilliant is not the funny accents, the quirky characteristics, the offbeat manners. For me the greatness of this film is revealed in the last couple of scenes. (SPOILERS AHEAD!!!)  When Marge finds Grimsrud and is put in harm's way by doing her job I can not think of a more gripping anxiety filled scene. Honestly when was the last time that there was a chase scene where you were really emotionally invested in what was taking place?  Then in the car when Marge talks to the automatonic Grimsrud you are glad and relieved that for once with all do respect to Dirty Harry that it is a normal, kind hearted, well adjusted, affable human being who has captured this monster so that we may receive catharsis through her words of insight which are uniquely similar to what most of us would say.  It is as if Marge is articulating what we have often thought or even said, but lacked a pulpit to preach from and a congregation to preach to.  That scene near the end of the film when we are in the car with Marge and Grimsrud to me is more than a catharsis though, it is an indictment of the loss of American values, it is an indictment of our seemingly insatiable appetite for gratuitous blood and mindless violence, and our propensity for greed.  When Marge says, 'and for what for a little money.  There's more to life than a little money you know,' you feel as if something has been restored and lost at the same time. Marge would be seen by many as a sentimental character, but that is because the world has grown cynical.  Is she oversimplifying in that scene?  No she's right and we're the ones who are lost.  That is if you believe films like dreams are keys to our unconscious and indicative of our true fears and desires.",

703,16 May 2010,crimsonsanctuary,7, good,"This movie tells the story of a scam gone wrong, because of the incompetence of its protagonists. This film is about its characters inability of people to communicate and humanity's greatest vice, a constant desire for more money. A great shot in this film was the extended close-up of her melancholic face after discovering the extent of Mike's lies. This is also when she becomes disillusioned with people, and this only increases as she comes to a face to face later in the movie. This movie is also about more than just people and humanity, its also about violence and how far would someone go for money. The value of life is strongly seen in this movie.

707,3 April 2001,pkendell,10, Virtue Triumphant,It's hard to find something new to say about this film after so many comments have already been posted here.  I'll own up to being one of the crowd who claim that it's close to flawless.,
708,17 August 1999,Daz99,10, It's a thrilling tale of greed that makes you want to be a better person,"First of all, the title, ""Fargo"" is insignificant, that's just the name of the town where the story begins.",
709,12 September 1999,ffwcsec,10, A great movie with one of the best female characters ever written for the screen.,"""Fargo"" is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Everything works...the acting, the location, the accents, the Cutlass Ciera.  The photography is visually stunning as well.  The scene where Jerry leaves Wade's office and walks to his car parked in the snow-covered lot has got to be one of the most memorable images ever filmed.  Frances McDormand's portrayal of Marge Gunderson was about as perfect as a performance can be.  The character of Marge is one of the best female characters ever written for the screen. She is smart, tender, sure of herself, nice, a good cop and a good wife to Norm. You just know she will be a good mother to her soon-to-be born child as well.  There should be more people like Marge in the world!",
710,8 May 2010,pinkpanther1164,9, Fargo,"The film Fargo from 1996 is a thriller directed by the Coen Brothers. This is not a typical thriller, more a dark comedy, one based on the twisted truths of what one man was ultimately capable of. Jerry's unimaginable decisions when he found himself stuck in a bind illustrate the twisted extremes a human can go to in pursuit of money. Jerry is the executive manager of one his father-in-laws car dealerships. Although his wife comes from a very wealthy family, Jerry does not have the close relationship; one he would need to be able to ask his in-laws for money. When he falls behind on his bills he comes up with the genius idea to have his wife kidnapped so he can cash in on the ransom money. He thinks his plan is fool proof, but it ends up hiring two dangerous men, more dangerous then he could ever imagine. His meeting with Carl and his eerily quiet friend end in multiple homicides, including a state trooper, Jerry's wife, his father-in law and even Carl. Margie, the chief officer involved in the investigating the kidnapping and the other homicides is seven month pregnant. Margie is a simple lady from a small town and she is very good at what she does. Margie suspects Jerry has something to do with his wife's disappearance almost immediately. His nervous twitchy demeanor catches her attention. Fargo is a seemingly slow paced film and builds without the need for dramatic music or the typical serial killer, but is still able to make you jump or squirm. The Coen brothers are brilliant in the way weave different horrible true stories into one amazing film. They show the intensity that a person can feel when they feel trapped in a corner with no way to go. Margie follows the clues and ties together seemingly unrelated events that all tie together in the end. One seemingly controlled act spiraled out of control leaving Jerry with noting in the end.",
711,9 January 2006,tom_75252,8, great movie,"Just thought this movie was great. I have watched it approximately 38.28 billion times. Well maybe not that many but at least twice a year since the first time I saw it. I thought the acting was great too. The scene where car sales manager (William H. Macy, a great actor) is getting interviewed by an investigator about his book-keeping, the way he performs acting so scared because he knows he's guilty, while trying to not show his emotions to the investigator... that is incredible acting. I don't know if Macy won an award for his role, but his acting really stuck out in my mind. But actually, excellent acting all the way around. I just love the way he keeps trying to act innocent, you can't really tell if he is lying or not, even though the viewer knows the truth.",
712,7 November 1999,Brooklyn-10,10," Good movie, not brainwashed","Someone made the comment that this movie must have been hyped to death for it to be rated so highly, that people must have been brainwashed. I have to relate my own experience. I saw this movie in March of 1996, when it was only in limited release, and there certainly had not yet been any hype, because so few people had seen it. I had gotten a gut feeling from seeing the previews that it was going to be good, mostly from the people involved and the fact that so little was given away in the trailers, which is so rare these days. I drove 50 miles to see this movie on one of the few screens showing it in the country. The theater was full, and it was obvious the vast majority was enjoying it immensely, as did I. So, sorry, the ""Brainwashed"" theory just doesn't apply here. That only works with movies like ""Star Wars: Episode I"". ""Fargo"" was as far from the world of hype as Minnesota is from Naboo. ""Fargo""- 10 out of 10, and that's MY opinion.",
713,23 October 2008,royals794,9, Difficult to say exactly why... but this movie is FANTASTIC!,"Fargo is not a straight up thriller. Nor is it a straight up comedy. It is not a drama, a romance, an action flick, or a story of redemption. What makes it so difficult to gauge is that it does not slip easily into one film genre or another. Perhaps that is why I see more threads about Fargo devoted to why this movie rocks or why it sucks than to any other movie. Some people go into it expecting a comedy and are disappointed. Others go in expecting a riveting thriller and also exit displeased. Those who go into this film simply expecting a great movie, however, will leave having watched one of the greatest pieces of art offered in the 1990's.",
714,29 November 1998,choppy,9, WOW this film is subtle.,"Fargo took me a few viewings to really appreciate, and judging by some of the other ecstatic reactions to this film, I still don't fully ""get"" it. Hidden in amongst what at first seems to be merely a quirky twist on the heist gone wrong staple is what I think is a strong message about the moral fibre of today's society.  Compare the money-hungry, deceitful, anti-social behaviour of the perennially miserable Macy and Buscemi to the constantly honest, happy, content and perennially cheerful nature of McDormand.",
715,9 March 1999,bart-44,10, My favourite film of the last five years,"Some of the 'experts' say this film will become very dated very quickly. But then, so what?  These characters are etched in my brain and I can't even think about some of the classic lines without laughing.  You don't have to analyze it too deeply -- just enjoy it.",
716,2 September 1999,JMann,10, a great example of realism,"I first saw Fargo in a grand, opulent, and beatifully restored 1920s movie theatre, now used for ""special screening"" films and the more accessible arthouse flicks.  Seeing Fargo was my first time in this theatre, and I return on a semi-regular basis.  I am glad to have had such a wonderful introduction, both to the theatre and to the film.  In both respects, Fargo is classic cinema: worthy of being seen in the palatial grandeur of the best movie houses, and the kind of movie that is well-remembered when discovering such wonderful old places.  Like the best output of the Coen Brothers, this is a remarkable character study relying on dark humor and cold realism (no pun intended) in creating a complicated and troubled scene of human emotions, troubles, and motives.  Its greatest success is in attributing each of its characters with a complexity of characteristics: each one can be liked in his or her own way, and each is presented with such realistic vision that the viewer is suspended in his predicaments.  The ability to capture the viewer is one attribute of a film that makes it great, and Fargo brilliantly displays that ability in the most subtle and quietly profound ways.",

718,5 January 2007,spencer10,10, A brilliant Masterpiece,"I had watched this movie last night for free on-demand on Comcast because I had heard it was excellent. I had also seen a few clips of it on the AFI's 100 years 100 movies. I usually don't listen to the critics or other people but they were right. This is a brilliant film. It deals with a car salesman (William H. Macy) who meets with two con-men (Steve Buscemi, I don't know the other guy's name). Anyway Macy hires Buscemi and his friend to kidnap his wife so his wealthy father-in law can pay a ransom. It then leads to the con-men going to Brainerd Minnesota after they kidnap her and a local cop (Frances McDormand) tries to investigate (after she is murdered) the murders of Macy's wife and other people. There are no complaints I have about this film. It has a little too much violence and profanity but oh well. I love McDormand's brilliant Minnesotan accent! She definitely deserved an Oscar. I demand you to check on-demand if you have it and watch this. It is under the free movies section. Enjoy the show!",
719,5 January 2002,philatwell,10, The Coen Brothers' best film,"""Fargo"" was the best film of 1996 in my opinion and the Coen Brothers best film. The film is a masterpiece that works as a thriller, a comedy, and a morality tale. The acting is superb lead by William H.

720,18 September 2010,willrasmussen-617-992319,10, A big yeah,This is one the most original movies of the 90s. The Coen Brothers do a excellent job in making this film.The acting is very clever. The plot is so original. I love how the story is so simple. It starts off as a simple non violent kidnapping that goes completely wrong. Jerry Lundegard works for a car dealership with his father in law and is an need of money for financial problems. So he hires two small time criminals to kidnapped his wife so his father in law can pay the ransom. Fargo is an excellent film and I highly recommend this movie to those that haven't seen it. It is filled with action.It is filled with suspense.It is also filled with some humor. Fargo is one of those types of movies that they don't make anymore. I give it a big thumbs up.,
721,18 January 2013,SchimoCro,9," Simply, every element of this film is excellent","Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is a car salesman who is convinced that he has a brilliant business plan that will ensure the life of his family, but there is one problem, he needs $ 750,000 that he, of course dosn't have. His wealthy father-in-law has repeatedly refused to help him so Jerry hatches an ingenious plan of kidnapping his own wife, after which he would be richer by $ 960,000 ransom which will be paid by his father-in-law and the kidnappers will get $ 40,000 and a new car that he stole from his own company, while kidnappers (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) are convinced that the total ransom is $ 80.000 and that they are sharing half of profit with Jerry. So, Jerry thought that plan, which includes kidnapping of his wife (which should be done by people unknown to him), car theft in the company he works for, extorting ransom from his father in law, fraud of kidnappers and if all goes according to plan the purchase of a large plot for $ 750.000 dollars and opening a parking is ingenious. But it all went wrong when shortly after making a deal with kidnappers he decided to give up from his plan but could not make a contact with the kidnappers who needed minimum time to turn this easy job into chaos. On the other hand we have Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), who as head of the district police department is investigating murders that lead her to Jerry and kidnappers. Marge is pregnant, sweet, intelligent and capable police officer who represents typical Minnesota resident. This story about easy non-violent crime that has grown into a bloodbath is presented with a large dose of humor, primarily through caricature characters. Even the description Buscemi's character is funny-looking guy. However, the characters are wonderfully characterized and memorable, just like their dialogues, which are often filmed in one shot what was possible only because of the brilliant acting (especially Frances McDormand, who was also awarded an Oscar for this role) and the phenomenal directing of Joel Coen while his brother Ethan took the role of producer. Although it was said at the beginning of the movie that it was filmed on a true story that is not true, but just a marketing trick by the Coen brothers. The truth is that almost all the events in the film took place in Minnesota in second half of 20. century but separated and unrelated. Coens collected few bizarre stories and urban legends and incorporated them in Fargo, which has become one of the best films ever made. Phenomenal photography, soundtrack that is almost perfect for this story, cold and snowy atmosphere that swallows the viewer, memorable characters, powerful dialogues, brilliant directing and superb acting. Simply, every element of this film is excellent.",
722,27 January 2016,joshvonhousen,4," Not Bad, But...","Well, as a ""film buff"", I've set out to watch anything and everything. And, after hearing a ton of hype for Fargo, I decided to give it a try. Now, the first half of the movie was actually pretty interesting. William H. Macy's character is one that is convincing, and is the kind of character that you just love to hate. His character is interesting, and I was getting invested. But, then the movie makes a big misstep in my opinion. That is, making Marge Gunderson the main character of this movie.I don't like this character at all. I think the performance is stiff, lifeless and her character is just so annoying. I expected this movie to be kind of similar to A Clockwork Orange, that being that even though this man is a criminal and kind of vicious, you still want to see him succeed. But, Marge is not interesting. There is zero development for her, and I don't care about her. Now, there is a lot said about the dark humor in this movie. I hear people saying that you don't know whether to humored or shocked by this movie. Well, outside of the scene where Marge is talking to the prostitutes, nothing was really humorous, and nothing in this movie was shocking. I dunno. I was born after this movie came out, so maybe it was shocking at the time, but nowadays, this is actually pretty tame. Actually, no! There was no way this was shocking to anyone even then because movies like A clockwork Orange and Reservoir Dogs had already come out by then! Look, this film does have some good performances, and the cinematography is decent, but I really can't see myself watching it more than the 2 times I already have! By no means a bad movie, and if you like it, that's fine, but i just didn't get the appeal of it.",

726,31 October 2013,jinmo2010,6," A good caricature of the white Midwest, but with a fly in the ointment","Fargo is a satire of the blankness and bleakness of the American Midwest. The movie is set as a crime story, but actually the Cohen brothers are poking fun at the monotonous, unimaginative, and humdrum life there under veneer of well-to-do. The thing is that the brothers are Jewish, and they were concerned that the white populace there would take the movie as what it really is—a social commentary on the goy way of life. Hence the solution, which is a racist solution—As a sop, create a nerdy and contemptible character and cast a colored person for the role, and balance it out. The Cohens picked an Asian because Asian Americans do not have an NAACP and would not picket the movie or create a ruckus unlike the blacks would have. That is why an Asian appears out of the blue in a movie set in Minnesota where less than 1% of the population is Asian. In other words, in a perverse way the Cohen brothers chose a racial solution to the political-correctness problem of their own movie. The dastardly solution speaks volumes for the Jewish brothers' essential cowardice, despite their apparent claim for making a social statement clothed in a crime story.",

It is one of those rare films which can have you talking about it the next week. So much of the credit goes to Daniel Day-Lewis who was do devoted to his role and made his character what he was. As you watch the movie, you will start to identify the traits of his character, which may be disguised at first. In my opinion, the whole film is about this man's character. It's about what will satisfy him in the end and how cold he is. Many people will choose to ignore the meaning in movies, and if you are this kind of viewer then don't bother. This is for people who take a lot of interest into films.",

731,3 September 2002,devon_chris,7, It was all going so nicely...,"This film is a fine, fine, piece of cinema from a couple of the neatest, slickest and most original directors in the business. Only one thing stops it from claiming its rightful place among the industry's finest - that makes it a great film rather than a classic film - and that's that it's too damn short! Admittedly, it doesn't cut you off with the same degree of frustrating incompletion that, say, 'Unbreakable' does, but to compare the two films at all would be insulting to the Coens. All the same though, the style and quality of the film just makes its brevity all the worse. Frances McDormand turns in one of the finest acting performances of recent years as the just-too-damn-smart detective, and the whole film is staged superbly - the Coen brothers' creation of a very dark movie in a very white setting is slick to the point of arty, but engaging enough to become too over-indulgently picturesque. The film is neat, clipped and wonderfully aesthetic. The comedy is as dark as it comes, but all the same entertaining - you find yourself laughing out loud at stuff you might feel you really shouldn't; it's more of an atmosphere of set-piece humour at times in the film, rather than anything deliberately comic about the script. So hey, maybe I'm being slightly picky about criticising the abrupt end to the film. Maybe it shouldn't really be any longer - perhaps to be longer would be to be make 'Fargo' less well-formed, and that would be unforgivable. I suppose it's just a personal thing - as a tragic product of the MTV generation I was hoping for a more dramatic ending, though the classic 'disposal' scene certainly added a certain uniqueness to the film, though it would be shame if such a fine work were to be remembered for just a woodchipper. Again coming from an MTV-generation point of view, I suppose the one thing this film lacks is a feeling of suspense, an adrenalin rush of some kind. But then a film doesn't need that sort of thrill factor to be good. This is not a film you see if you want the kind of high-octane entertainment that, say, 'Bad Boys' or 'Terminator' will supply. Having said that, I can think of few people who would crack open the beers and watch 'Schindler's List' with a pizza - this is a film treat, an artistic, phenomenally slick and polished work with a well-picked, select cast that features not a single wooden line, and along with McDormand's masterful performance there are fine roles by Buscemi and Macy as the cuss-filled crook and the chirpy-to-the-point-of-irritating loser car salesman who hires him. A great lesson in how to make a film - the plot is very simple, but the way it unravels, as well as the style of the piece as a whole, make Fargo a winner. Watch with a glass of something warming, while in a contemplative, patient mood for best results.",
732,28 February 2010,Useful_Reviewer,9," Dark, but well done","Fargo is a dark crime drama. There is some subtle Coen Brothers humor mixed in, but ultimately it's a story about bad people doing a bad thing, and a good cop investigating it. The Coens' masterful direction somehow seems to convey two perspectives at once, as you can clearly see the action through Jerry's (William H. Macy) eyes, but you can also see it through Marge's (Frances McDormand) eyes: two very different viewpoints.",
733,2 May 2010,aeboynton,6, Fargo,"Acting in this movie was almost mocking the Minnesota accent at first but at the end of the movie, you realize the simplicity of their lifestyle is critical to the impact of the story. It adds drama and creates a more violent story line. There was symbolism in the life of the police woman versus her job. she seemed able to to separate her personal emotions from the crime and bloodshed, however in the end we see that it does finally effect her. This movie also shows how things in life cannot be planned and life has a way of not following the original path one sets out.

With a great blend of thrills and comedy Fargo in my opinion offers something most movies fail to offer and it succeeds on every level. The film is perfectly cast. McDormand as the police office was hilarious. Just the way the talk and the lines the characters say makes this movie worth it. It's as if they don't take what they're doing seriously but you know they do.

738,28 February 2008,Biglebowski1,9, Yah,"Fargo is arguably the Coen Brothers' best movie (though personally I think it's their second-best, after No Country For Old Men). I was pleasantly surprised by the simplicity of the storyline, as many movies concerning crime are often too fast paced and reliant on plot twists. Instead, Fargo's plot develops more through the characters than through what is actually occurring on the screen. The characters themselves, especially Jerry Lundegard, are very well thought out and work in perfect unison with the simplicity of the story. There are no hard-boiled, cynical detectives here, just a simple policewoman who uses basic techniques to outwit her inexperienced counterparts. While I believe William H Macy's performance was stronger than Frances McDormand's, he also had more to work with. The Coen Brother's dialog and direction must be noticed here, as they create many moments of subtle humor which are very entertaining without distracting from the plot. Examples of this include the bartender's ""crazy down there by the lake"" story, and the infamous wood-chipper scene. The ending is very satisfying, as the bad guys get what they deserve, and life goes on.",

Everything about this movie is amazing, but what intrigued me the most was the dialog.  I'm from a province in Canada that is located directly above North Dakota and am therefore familiar, and sometimes find myself using, the dialog style or accent that was used superbly in this film.  Not only is the dialog amazing, but the performances of Bill Macey and Frances McDormand  are two of the best I have ever seen.  To truly appreciate the accuracy of the screenplay and performances in Fargo you should visit North Dakota or Western Canada someday.  I'm sure you'll laugh if you happen to overhear the smalltalk (it's pretty darn cold eh). Besides the incredible originality and accuracy of the settings and characters, the Coen brothers create this plot that seems so out of place in this small quiet community of farmers and shop owners.  And yet what makes it so intriguing is the fact that such evil and deceit could occur in such a harmless environment.  I recommend that everybody see this movie and appreciate it for the many things (little and  big) that it does so well.",

Mike's tale is woeful indeed ... but as we learn later, it's all an elaborate ruse. The same can be said for ""Fargo,"" but who cares? This is one movie I can watch over and over and NEVER get tired of.

748,31 March 2017,iollann,6, Review-Fargo,"Review: 'Fargo' Another film by the Coen brothers, Fargo, starring William H. Macy, Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, is about a man in financial problems who devises to hire men to kidnap his wife so his wealthy father in law will pay for her release and in turn pay off his debt. Fargo is a crime, drama and a thriller. It was released in 1996. To be completely honest I didn't really like this film I had seen 'The Big Lebowski' before going into this film and just had such high hopes. I thought 'The Big Lebowski' was far superior. Although I thought that having Steve Buscemi as a major character was better than how he is in 'The Big Lebowski' with him only having a couple of lines, even still he was very funny in 'The Big Lebowski'. His performance as Carl is very good. He plays a very violent, crazy guy. His partner in crime Gaear played by Peter Stormare is also portrayed very well and its actually quite funny watching him grimace at the violence of Buscemi's character. One of the reasons I thought 'The Big Lebowski' is better is because I thought it was far funnier. In 'Fargo' I felt that too many times the comedy was centred on the characters accents. It was funny the first time but it got old quick. Especially for Frances McDormand's character I felt that most of the humour was just the accent. Apart from one scene I didn't really like her character. When she is interviewing one of the criminals and he drives off and she exclaims 'oh for Pete's sake, he's fleein' the interview' I thought that was her standout scene to be honest. I thought she over did the 'Yas' throughout the film. I especially found it hard to relate to her and sympathize with her. I felt the overuse of the accent again was the cause of that. I think the jokes with the accent went over my head because I've never been to Minnesota. One thing that really worked for me was the visuals. For me the setting is the reason for this. The snow really makes everything look great. The contrast between the dark clothes of the characters and the snow looked really good. I think the most iconic thing for me is the scene where the car drives past the statue of the lumberjack. This for some reason just really stuck out in my mind. Whenever I think of Fargo I think of that statue. In conclusion the story is decent, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are excellent along with William H. Macy. Frances McDormand is a bit hit and miss as well as most of the humour in the film. In the end, I give it a 6/10. I found it very hard to like it especially in comparison with 'The Big Lebowski'.",
749,3 February 2006,kamas716,6, interesting,"Fargo? Let's face it, the Cohen's didn't think ""Bemidji"" made a good sounding title. Being from Fargo, I remember when they were shooting the outdoor scenes (it was a warm winter and they were having trouble finding snow). The only scene in Fargo (and it wasn't even shot here) is at the very beginning. Everything else takes place in Minnesota. Some people criticized the accents (but I've been in a lot of little towns where the people sound exactly like that).",
750,9 January 2000,Dietrich,10, The Coens' Best,"This is without a doubt the Coen Bros' best film. Splendid cinematography, a chilling score, clever script, and brilliant performances make this quirky dark comedy a modern classic. Frances McDormand and William H. Macy are especially memorable. BTW to those who say the scene in the bar with Marge and her high-school chum Mikey was unnecessary, this is not so. Mikey tells Marge how he has married and had children, and that her wife had recently passed away. Marge believes her good friend. But several scenes later she finds out that everything he told her was a lie. This makes Marge question the sincerity of Jerry Lundengard when she first interviewed him, because if a sweet good-natured guy like Mikey can concoct such a lie then so could Lundengard. She finds out Mikey lied to her, the VERY NEXT SCENE she returns to the car dealership to re-interview Lundengard who realizes she may have put the pieces together, so he flees the scene. If Marge never met up with Mikey, she wouldn't have exposed Lundengard as a conspirator. This is the reason that amusing scene is so important. Got it? Good. Have a nice day.",

I join with those who gave negative votes in this movie, my vote is rational about what the film I had transmitted. 4/10 gravely insufficient. why? because I understand that in the end they wanted to create a bizarre story, humorous or something like this, but I really do not understand what can be fun. I will not love this kind of humor behind the lines (some scenes I appreciated and I understood the meaning behind it) but overall it was boring and too foolish to say the least. many unnecessary scenes and despite this a film that barely exceeds the hour and a half of life, incredible. I do not know how to evaluate the Oscars to McDormand surely be a good test of acting, (but also other Buscemi in the first place) but not having seen all the films nominated can not do a real comparison. For the rest I do not know, when a film so short you can not wait for it to finish or that you look at him as if to say ""so what's the point,"" there's something wrong.",

Generally i like movies which scenes are laid in a cold, drear land, but although the film had some stunning scenes, it's rather dull and uninteresting, that contains incomprehensible characters without any sympathy. It's actually quite boring and overrated. Could have told a better story. There's so many other films, that has much more potential difference. I don't see the hype(?) either.

766,29 August 2020,Rebul21,8, A wacky but fun murder film,"Fargo is set in a very unique environment, with snow all around and some very awkward and odd characters. Where this film shines is in its fairly interesting plot and well written characters. The Coen brothers showed off their intelligent and bizarre writing with a kidnapping goes wrong plot. It had great pacing and a clever set of events with the story shown from different perspectives in a refreshing way. While I found the key instigator character to this plot, Jerry Lundegaard, frustrating and irritating, other characters had some charm. Steve Buscemi's character, Carl, was particularly well done. The acting was on point, as you'd expect from Buscemi, and the character had some odd charm to him, he was comedic, down to earth and this created for an interesting sort of bad-guy. He was complimented nicely by the not-so-talkative Gaear, played by Peter Stormare. Gaear was a more typical bad-guy in being clearly ruthless and without remorse; but the pair made for an oddly fun couple of bad-guys. Marge Gunderson, played by Frances McDormand, was another well thought out character. She almost personified the town in her awkwardness and relationship with her husband but was funny and copper that fitted with the film very well.",

The matter of factualness of people to what is going on and the overall plot made for a good movie. This movie makes my top 10 list. Unfortunately it isn't easily availible on DVD :(.

Partly because it was such an odd story and partly because the people of North Dakota were portrayed so inaccurately. As I was watching, I was looking forward to seeing how they would present these totally unique people to me and I was sorely disappointed. Perhaps it's because much of my family originates from North Dakota, but i was hoping to see a part of someone I could recognize, but all the people were just simple, everyday stereotypes of Midwestern folk. Still, the story was intriguing, and though the people didn't seem entirely real to me, they made an amusing spoof. I'd say that it's about a 7/10. Not perfect, but still worth the watch",

Well, it just keeps you in front of the screen, waiting to see what happens next. And you will be surprised, believe me.

The only saving grace of this movie is steve buscemi as he is somewhat entertaining in this. Overall this movie is a boring mess and one i hope that i never have to watch again.,
775,31 March 2012,rileyedwardcowan,10, Should you watch Fargo? You betcha!,"Fargo is a very rare occurrence in films. It is a perfect storm of actors, writers/directors, cinematographers, and an amazing plot. Each character has their own unique traits that fit together so well that you wonder if the story is actually based on a true story.  As the plot twists around in a very entertaining way, you are brought on a ride you won't forget. The genius writing of the Coen brothers has never been this good. 'The Big Lebowski' was one of the best films I have ever seen but it doesn't have the same effect that Fargo has.  Movies like this are the reason I watch movies in the first place. It connects with you on a personal level no matter who you are, but especially if you are from the Midwest. If you have ever seen a film in your life you should have seen this one. No chance of disappointment.",
776,11 February 2005,niklas-krogerus,10, Extra points for making me feel like an asshole,"Fargo, for me, was quite a powerful experience, some of it, admittedly, on account of the latitude factor. You see, I happen to live a bit to the north, and quite a lot to the east of the movie setting (and Fargo is proof that an ocean cannot separate two nations united by hockey!). As such, I have seen for myself how the obsessive mentality of the west fuses with the ""conditioned-by-the-elements"" type characters of the north, to create some very confused individuals (this is stereotyping, but you get the idea).",
777,19 September 2019,jayparenteau,8, I'm biased but..,"Fargo is a hilarious depiction of my home state and it's people. Some characters accents I thought, were very exaggerated but if you're not from there you wouldn't know that, (so they needed to be). William H. Macy does a phenomenal job balancing the accent with tone, he gives a frantic performance that is true to his character and is honestly from an acting standpoint VERY hard to juggle. Apart from the stories dark nature, a lot is shown in its lightest moments, it is a fine line between comedy and tragedy and the Coen brothers rode it the whole way. One characteristic that makes this film stand out to me is it's ability to let dialogue alone carry a scene, I'm a huge advocate for less bells and whistles and more interesting conversations. A particular scene in which this is illustrated is when Steve Buscemi's character is cussing out his partner for being silent in the car. A. It's a long take and B. His lines are stagnant and choppy. This allows the viewer to experience his frustrations in real time, something that a lot of films tend to scrape out. In conclusion I'd tell you to see this film primarily for the acting, however the story itself is interesting and worthy of your time, especially if you know something about Minnesota/North Dakota.",

780,19 August 2001,JFrEaken,10, Brilliant doesn't even begin to describe this film.,"Brilliant doesn't even begin to describe this film. Each character has been drawn so carefully and with so much delicacy that we must be interested. Who can NOT identify with William H. Macy's amazing Jerry and his feeling of being in a hole so deep, you'll do whatever you can to dig yourself out, regardless of how extreme it may be. And then when your hole just gets deeper and deeper, it's just so very tragic. Macy is terrific at playing these types of characters, (and if you haven't seen his 2000 movie, ""Panic"" shame on you) where he's in trouble and he can't seem to find his way out, no matter how hard he tries. Next up is Marge, played with amazing subtlety by Frances McDormand, who is just a great actress. While she doesn't seem to say ALL that much in the movie, I wouldn't call her character simple by any means. She is thinking. Should we force this cop to talk about everything she's discovering and realizing just because she's in a movie? That's ridiculous. And, here's what I read about the Asian man, and it makes perfect sense. (Warning: This kindof reveals some stuff that I think is common knowledge, but all who haven't seen this great film may not know. Yeah, don't read this without seeing the movie) The scene with them at the restaurant takes place just after she talks to Jerry the first time, and nothing happens. She talks with the Asian man and finds out that all that stuff he had told her was a lie. So then she realizes that Hey! this could be the case with Jerry as well, so she goes back and interrogates him once more, and discovers she was right. There you go. It makes perfect sense. I love the way that the grisly aspects in Fargo are treated as not so much hilarious as they are peculiar and bizarre, such as the kidnapping. It's funny, but in a peculiar way. I think that is the best way to describe this movie. It is engaging, fascinating, to me just plain irresistable, and peculiar.",

So I couldn't say that I liked it.

The wood chipper sequence, the cruel laugh Carl screamed when Gene fell in the snow, and of course the idea of kidnapping your own wife. The movie also was funny because it didn't try to be. For instance when Carl was being beaten up by Shep or when he was shot in the face or when blew a fuse on the parking man. The movie was made in a way that seemed funny yet mixed it in with death.

791,27 May 2018,mattchamplain,8, The true story that is a true story.,"The Second movie directed by Joel Cohen ""Fargo"", is a story of a terrible husband who intentionally put his wife up for ransom may not have been a true story but it is an entertaining and at times intriguing watch nonetheless. Jerry Lundegaard(Played by William Macy) is a poverty stricken car salesman who devised a plan to have his wife Jean Lundegaard, (played by Kristin Rudrüd)kidnapped and held for a million dollar ransom to make a quick buck from his father in law(played by Harvey Presnell). All according to plan until the ""funny looking"" thugs hired by Jerry (played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) out of sheer incompetence, murder a police officer who pulls them over and two ordinary people passing through who where at the wrong place, at the wrong time. The best part of this film has to be how the movie intrigues with each turn of events in the story that only increase the tension between the viewers and the main character jerry, as his whole plan comes crashing down on him especially when he learns that his ransom will have to be raised to 80,000 to compensate for the unnecessary deaths. Not only that but he also has to worry about the intrusive police officer Marge, (played by Frances McDormand) investigating the triple homicide. The only shortcoming of Fargo have to be the simple dialogue, the almost static camera angles and little character growth but overall, Fargo is a stellar movie and well deserving of the cult-appeal it has received following its initial release in 1996.",

From the way the characters are introduced to the way the plot develops to the great acting of all actors involved, this movie delivers a great 1h30 (just a little over that) piece of entertainment. It is the kind of movie that from the beginning will catch your attention and wont let go until the credits start rolling on the screen.
Frances Mcdormand (won an oscar for her role), Steve Buscemi and William Macy are specially good in their respective roles. The writing and directing from the Coen brothers is exceptional and deserved all the awards and nominations, in my opinion it should have won not only best writing but best picture as well.
If you like thrillers about crime this is a must watch, do not miss it.",
799,10 January 2019,palermocarlos,9, Genuis of the Cohen's.,"This is a very good, darkly comic film. Its maybe a bit too short and rushed at the end, but then most Cohen films are that way. It has two great performances, by Steve Buscemi and Frances McDormand. The rest of the cast are good, but not quite as up to the standard. Follwing a vagurly sinister beginning, the plot gets way and it is a crazy one, crazy like Raising Arizona and the Big Lebowski. What follows is violence (one scene involving a woodchipper), the odd moment of humour, and a whole lot of whacky scenes, making for an entertaining film.",
800,21 December 1998,mebhere,10, Should be higher on da list?,"FARGO - This is an excellent movie with lots of atmosphere.  It really puts you in a kind of a silly/surreal MinneKota dreamland.  Superb performances by all actors lead and supporting, along with some beautiful camera-work. Nice to watch on a dark, cold, snowy night with the lights out. There's a strong morality message interwoven into the tale.  But, it's not biting your head off, it is subtle, abstract perhaps?  It is beautiful > Dark, Hilarious, Absurd, Gorey, Warm.  One of the finest films of the 90s that I have seen.  Definitely the Coen Brothers masterpiece, with Raising Arizona a bit behind.",
801,8 September 2000,Coffin Conan,10, One of the best American movie ever!,The greatness of this movie was evident the first time I saw it but it continued to grow with each viewing. The character development is nothing short of amazing and should be used as a medium in film school for years to come. If your a true movie fan or really into the process of film making take the time to study this movie. It's a prime example that relatively unknown (but good) actors and a score instead of a lame modern sound track can change everything. Well that and an amazing script and direction.,

It is, granted, an acquired taste, as are most Coen Bros. movies (""Big Lebowski"" more so than most).  One of the things that brings me back to this film over and over again is the realistic portrayal, particularly with regard to the accent, of upper-midwesterners. There's not much more frustrating to me than films that purportedly are set in a locale, yet the characters do or say nothing that people who actually live there would (""Stigmata"" is a particularly egriegous example that takes place right here in Pittsburgh).

Some time after, I decided to give another chance to the writer, then I found Fargo. A very well rated movie, quoted on many other productions, soon I was dying to watch it. When I finally did, I struggled to keep myself awake just to be sure I wasn't being unfair. The narrative is slow and boring, the story is just dull. Not even the good actors could save this piece from total disaster.

From it's beautiful snow covered landscapes to it's cast of amazing actors, Fargo is a thrilling crime drama with a fair amount of humor. The snowy lands of Minnesota are a pleasure to the eyes, with many shots being almost completely white. The snow helps highlight what's going on. For example, when the cop is shot, his blood stains the snow, making his splatter almost art-like. The actors are pretty funny, all of their cheesy accents truly do help the humor. Frances, the main protagonist, won an award for best lead actress for her humorous delivery of her lines and especially for her silly accent. One actor from Fargo that is easily in my top 3 would be Steve Buscemi. He looks funny, he is funny, he's just a funny guy and makes Fargo the comedy it is. Fargo is a blend of drama, comedy, and perfect shots from the ingenious Coen Brothers.",

Ethan Cohen did an incredible job of making the movie so brutal and cold. You can feel the dark tension while watching the kidnappers in the car as well as the cabin. All the performances were great but Frances McDormand and William H. Macy were the best. Frances McDormand performance was remarkable as the detective and deserved the academy award. She was the constant moral individual in a setting of immoral people. Macy's performance was equally impressive. One aspect of this movie that sets the haunting tone is the score which was was perfect for the movie. If you like drama's you will thoroughly enjoy this film.",

Frances McDormand was perfect and deserved her Oscar, the plot was well put together, and the pace flowed well. However, I have to say that this film is just a little bit overrated. It is an excellent comedy, but when I first saw it, I was expecting a little more. It was hilarious (those accents), however the ending was weak and I don't think it was an Oscar caliber movie. I also can't see why it is on the top 100 films of all time list according to AFI. It was like 90 or something. Comedy wise, it's right up there, but poignant films such as American Beauty, Almost Famous and Traffic are much more deserving of being on a 100 Greatest list.

It hasn't aged a jot and is as memorable as I well, remembered it! Watched on a crappy old TV but listened to through a decent HiFi (I've kept an excellent example of VHS HiFiness for such purposes) the standard stereo soundtrack to this film (as with all the CB's films) is superb, bringing hidden depths to the surface as the music envelopes the ratcheting tension. If only more recent movies could be as precise with their soundtracks instead of ruining them with overblown sound! Then of course, there's the excellent cast with a story that's so compelling in its telling that you become quickly absorbed and just don't want it to end!

I will not give any spoilers to those who have not been fortunate to catch this classic, but watching the caper unfold and progressively get worse and worse is one of the most arresting experiences I have ever had in cinema. The plot revolves around Jerry Lundergard (Macy) hiring two thugs (Beschemi and Stormare) to kidnap his wife. He plans then to get the ransom from his over-powering father in-law and escape the crushing debt of both financial and emotional proportions. Of course nothing goes as planned and the caper takes deeper and darker turns. If you are a fan of the Coen Brothers I would put this at the top of the list!",

Taking a guessable plot and planting it into the imposing vastness of a North Dakota-Minnesota winter and coming up with a perfect cast, impeccable timing, unforgettable score (by Carter Burwell) and a world of everyday eccentricities, Joel and Ethan Coen create a gripping dark comedy that we often fail to see beyond the local news. And this is what great movie makers are all about, showing us things our perceptions remain short of imagining as we read, hear or watch them happening around.

You watch the story of this bungling car salesman unfold, watch as we are taken deeper into his sad, shallow and cowardly mind, and see how his ""simple plan"" slowly strangles him as the circumstances spin out of his control. The body count grows and we get more and more a feeling of senselessness to it all, which the hero sums up so well with her lecture to the criminal at the end. The barren and unforgiving wasteland in which the movie is set is a perfect backdrop to this story of isolation, but the hero's constantly perky disposition is the perfect antidote, a reminder that human nature can be as good as it wants to be.",

Fargo was hands down the best movie of 1996 (against The English Patient, Jerry Maguire, and Independence Day) and from all the movies I've seen, about the last original movie made. Think about it, what genre is Fargo under, comedy, drama, crime, thriller. It is all of them. And now that the 90s are over, I can say Fargo is the 3rd best of the decade (#1 Schindler's List, #2 Forrest  Gump) and deserved more at the Academy Awards, William H.

Steve Buscemi played a delightful and a strong role and it was his ever the best role in this film and the energy of his speech delivery was unbelievably done and had matched the character correctly and lastly for Peter Stormare's role was much mature and he really got so in to the role that it was like its his real life attitude and I was so great full to watch this film it's a mind-blowing crime classic that I ever watch.And if you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favour and see it and It is very well put together and the plot is constantly evolving into a deeper shade of creepiness.",

William H. Macy and Peter Stormare were very good too. I have not much to say about the soundtrack, it was not a big deal.

853,26 November 2014,kchiabai,10, Middle America Spirit,"Of all the Cohen Brother's tremendously entertaining movies, this is the best. This is the one that they will be remembered for. William H. Macy plays Jerry Lundegaard, a man in a spot. He's a used car salesman that has been securing loans for cars that are not really in his lot. The bank is calling in the loans, threatening legal action, and he needs money fast. He forms a plan to have his own wife kidnapped, thereby splitting the ransom money between himself and the kidnappers. It's a terrible plan, and it quickly unravels into a bloody mess of murder and betrayal. When bodies begin to mount, a local police officer, Marge Gunderson, is called in. Frances McDormand plays Marge Gunderson, and she makes the movie magical. McDormand won an Oscar for the role, and this is one instance when the recipient deserved the award. She plays ""Margie"" with a huge dose of humanity. She is a character that sneaks up on you. When she is introduced, you wonder if perhaps she is just a small town officer in way over her head. She is pregnant, speaks in small town (Minnesota) idioms, and throws up from morning sickness when investigating the first brutal murders. She seems more like a nice, Minnesotan housewife than a cop. But early you get the feeling that there is something special about her. The killings involve a traffic cop that was killed while issuing a ticket for a missing plate. In his log book, he was written DLR. When Marge's fellow officer says that he has run a search for all tags starting with DLR, Marge says gently, ""I'm not sure I agree with you 100 percent on your police work there, Irv."" She explains to Irv that DLR means that it was a new car, a dealer's car. ""Oooh"" says Irv, staring into space. Then Marge tells Irv a joke about the guy that couldn't afford a vanity license plate, so he changed his name to FGS1135. ""That's a good one,"" says Irv, but it is clear Marge's wit has gone over his head. The brilliance of the scene is that Marge is never cruel or condescending to Irv, never thinks less of him, and is not making fun of him. She is simply enjoying her own intelligence, and we can see the very private sparkle in her eyes. Marge also has a core of steel. Watch the scene where she gets information from a menacing suspect by reminding him, with almost motherly concern, about all the trouble he has been in with the law, and the fact that he is actually in violation of his parole. She cracks him like an egg without ever loosing her smile. All actors concerned give great performances. Steve Buscemi brings his pitch-perfect snide larceny to the table, playing one of the kidnappers; and Peter Stormare (who once played Hamlet in an Igmar Bergman production) utters perhaps 15 words in a terrifying performance as the other kidnapper. And, of course, William H. Macey couldn't have played it Better. His Jerry Lundegaard is so full of stress and fear, you can't watch him without squirming. I have read where this film has been criticized for making fun of the people of Minnesota, poking fun at their accents and manners. This is not true. The Coen Brothers grew up in Minneapolis, and this is their homage to their own people. The folks in Minnesota may talk funny to the reviewers watching movies in New York and Los Angeles, but this film in no way makes fun of them. At the end of the day, Marge and her husband are happily going to sleep in their bed, in love with one another and content with their shared life. How many other couples portrayed in a Coen Brother's film can make this claim? How anyone can watch Marge Gunderson in action and think the Coen's were making fun of her is beyond me. Like Marge, they are simply enjoying their own intelligence.",

I have watched it many times, and sometimes I feel like crying in every scene, and others I bust out laughing in all of them.

It has a few known stars and was filmed almost all in Minnesota and North Dakota except for a few scenes in a set. The film is a short flick, 99 Minutes. But in that time changed Hollywood's perspective of film. Just for a note, the humor I say is mostly comedy drama, because only a few murders happen, but when they are really funny. The filming is beautiful, from a scene in a bar, to a scene in the middle of a field. For 7000K, that's pretty good. Yes this film is better then Avatar or any film in that concept.

As a 14 year old, one might think this movie's subtle humor and nuances and relatively relaxed pace may bore my agegroup, but I believe that this movie has a little something for everyone. SPOILER!!!!!!   From the beautiful scenery and ND/MN winter, to Steve Buscemi's fateful scene of being fed through the wood chipper, this is truly the coen's masterpiece. Frances Mcdormand does a beautiful job as margie, the (very) pregnant cop in perpetual marital bliss. She does a great job throughout, culminating with her ""for a little bit o' money"" righteous speech. William H. Macy, one of the most underappreciated actors in hollywood in my opinion, does an extraordinary job exploring the complex role of a desperate man pushed to a seemingly innocent crime, the whole time with a heavy northern midwest accent. The Coens pepper the entire thing with wonderfully subtle humour, from Mcdormand's talk to an old high school classmate to many quiet bloody jokes. The brothers directing is as usual outstanding, their intuition shines through. My favorite character of this movie is Steve Buscemi's. His foul-mouthed, chain-smoking, just me character is one of the best roles I have seen in any movie in my life. There's simply no way to describe his masterful performance that will do him service. the cream of the crop. 10/10",

I remember I liked the film back then...however I recently saw the film again, and I like it even more. In my opinion, ""Fargo"" is the perfect example of a dark comedy. Although some scenes may be more serious and even graphic in some cases, there were a few times where I laughed out loud...especially due to Steve Buscemi's character. Frances McDormand gives an outstanding role, as does William H. Macy. And the team of Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi gives the movie what it needs to be my favorite film of 1996. I recommend this film to people who want an easy to follow, yet clever plot to a serious, yet sometimes dark humorous filled film.",

875,14 February 2016,tcf1281,7, Great dark comedy you betcha!,"Believe it or not I finally got around to watching this movie last night at a midnight movie showing at a local movie theater. I knew going in it was a Coen bros. film, set somewhere up north, that starred Steve Buscemi. Other than that I had no clue about the plot or other characters, or the Oscar wins and high ratings on this site. That being said, this is a good dark comedy, a little on the violent side in some parts, but very well done. CONTAINS SPOILERS The movie is set in a bone-chilling, Minnesota/North Dakota, in the late 1980's, supposedly based on a true story. It is about Jerry Lundergan(William H. Macy), a weaselly car salesman that is having money problems(that is never really explained), who comes up with a plan to have his wife kidnapped and for his wealthy father-in-law to pay the ransom, with most of the money actually going to him. Once the plan is in motion, very little goes right and quite a bit of blood, mayhem and comedy occur. The atmosphere and screen shots are what I liked most about this film. The Coen's did a wonderful job of making you feel the cold and wilderness of the upper Midwest. The camera work was stunning and IMO is what really makes this movie great. The plot itself is good, a little slow at first, but really ramps up as the movie goes on. It is a dark comedy, with humor peppered in just the right amount. Some of the characters are over-the-top with heavy mid-western accents, some are just plain over-the-top. My only beef with the movie is the blood and violence. I think they could have made this movie just as good without the gore. I also think some of the character development was a little rushed, with a few characters adding very little to the story or plot. Overall a beautifully filmed dark comedy, and a must see! 7/10",

Great movie.","Independent film makers, the Coen brothers have achieved critical and box-office success with their two-time Oscar award winning film, Fargo. ¬The ""homespun murder mystery"" is an amalgamation of genres: crime drama, violent thriller, neo-noir, and, satirical comedy. The offbeat narrative juxtaposes small town pleasantries and lightheartedness with macabre violence, in an absurdly humorous tale of debauchery. Critical distance is a key element of ¬Fargo, which is a result of the frequent use of farce in their depictions of ""everyday violence in US culture"" (Lewis 2002). Through this, an ""original social commentary"" emerges, amongst the crazy, sardonic, approaches to style and narrative. The cult and spectacle of violence in American society is epitomized in the film, depicted through the thoughtless killings, and most, notably, in the infamous wood chipper scene. ",

881,15 June 2021,alexfioren,8, Not the masterpiece most people think it is,"""Fargo"" is a highly overrated film which I assume is mainly due to the manipulation of the Coen Brothers claiming it was not only a true story but that it was also being told exactly as the actual events occurred. When you snap yourself out of being manipulated into believing it is true you see the film is highly flawed and unbuyable. We are expected to believe that the police would question someone and just fall for what he pulled on them with no questions asked and completely forget about the lead altogether. Then we are to believe that an out of the blue phone call from an old schoolmate just happened to result in a get together that somehow brings upon thoughts that she was being duped in the initial interview prompting her to go back with more gumption and do her job the way it should have been done to begin with. That is just one of many flaws in the film and do not get me started on the cartoonish film work. The greatness of the performances is also over exaggerated and should not have won Oscar gold. As far as the screenplay I suppose when you take in to account that they gave that Oscar to ""The Usual Suspects"" the year before, which also was highly manipulative and a much worse movie - in fact it is by far the worst movie to ever make it to the Oscars, it seems par for the course.",

But Fargo leaped right in at the number one slot just as soon as the credits finished rolling. This is a flawless film. The dialogue is outstanding, staying just the right side of quirky colloquialism with out sounding too cornball. The performances are perfect (How William H.

The performances of the two who play the kidnappers is truely something to be marveled at. On one hand, you have the silent, dark , brooding type, then you get to the other, a loud extrovert who gets so frightened when the first murder of the officer happens, it's just so contradicatry. The whole of the film is centered about the comical thriller aspect of the narration, mainly being omniscient when the scene cuts back to Jerry and Wade, but being balanced between restrictive and omniscient when the kidnappers are featured. If the film has any bad points, I for one, certainly can't see them. Ok, so I may like this sort of film, but it's because it's a change from the usual. It's funny, and scary at the same time, much like Psycho after the 2nd viewing and seeing all the in-jokes.

The kidnap was supposed to be the clean cut and no one was supposed to be hurt. By the end of the film people were killed and no one ended up with the ransom money as planned. The kidnap was a disaster from the beginning, when Carl and Gaear met up with Jerry he showed up late at the bar and they were upset. Then when they went to kidnap Jean, she ended up knocking herself out by getting wrapped in a shower curtain and falling down the stairs. After that it goes from bad to worse, they have to kill a highway patrol and an innocent person who just happen to be riding by. The movie was filled with drama but also comical, because of some of the events that took place. Like Jean getting wrapped in the shower curtain, the investigating sheriff Marge being pregnant and also Marge's voice seem so high pitch and nonchalant. Another comical scene was when she met her friend Mike in the restaurant for lunch, that scene was funny to me but I didn't understand how it related to the film at all. The lighting in the film was very mild; although it was winter and there was white snow outside it was still a cloud look throughout the film. There weren't any bright moments in the film they were always a dim look in the scenes. The light wasn't bright most like to make the plot of the crime look more interesting and unexcited. I think if there would have been bright lighting in the film it would have gave the audience the same effect as with the dim lighting.",

The editing and cinematography is seamless and carries the story forward. Especially loved Frances McDormand in this movie and the trademark Coen-brothers-style character quirks make certain scenes truly unforgettable. Overall, the movie plays out very beautifully. Definitely worth a watch!",
912,15 April 2013,jonathan-hanson27,9, Wacky crime drama,"I saw this film with my wife just after we were married but not yet had kids. We saw quite a few very good films during that 2/3 year period. This certainly is up there with the best! I would recommend this to anyone who likes slightly offbeat films with a few twists along the way. William H Macey and Frances McDormand in particular give superb performances. It is a typical Coen brothers effort, actually it is one of their best in my opinion. Although it states in the titles that this was a true story I don't believe that it actually was. However it is a very entertaining if slightly unbelievable story. Go and see it but not if you are squeamish!",
