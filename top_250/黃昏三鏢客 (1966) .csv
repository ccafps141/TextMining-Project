0,29 June 2006,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," For a girl who doesn't enjoy westerns much, this was one of the greatest films ever!","Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.",/
1,1 January 2004,Quinoa1984,10, Sergio Leone's penultimate Italian-western; a film that gets better with each passing year...,"...and though those last several words could also be attributed to Leone's ""Once Upon a Time"" films (West and America) as well as the other pieces in his trilogy of films with Clint Eastwood- Fistful of Dollars and For a Few More Dollars- arguably this is the most ambitious and spellbinding one of the bunch, and one that has inspired (i.e. Quentin Tarantino, Sam Raimi, Robert Rodriguez) and will most likely continue to inspire filmmakers and fans into the 21st century. There's something in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly that's nearly (or perhaps is) mythical in it's craft, certain scenes come off as being more than relevant and exquisite for that scene/sequence- it transcends into aspects of humanity.",r
2,16 April 2001,MadReviewer,10," Brutal, brilliant, and one of the best Westerns ever made","A sprawling Western epic that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen gold, Sergio Leone's `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is a masterpiece, one that continues to get better and better with each viewing.  In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in a realistic manner.  Sometimes, crime does pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good does go unrewarded. This film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional John Wayne `White Hat/Black Hat' Western.",e
3,19 February 2009,murtaza_mma,10," The Good, the Better, the Best","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly or the Good, the Better and the Best, as I prefer calling it, is a bizarrely sublime and a uniquely aesthetic masterpiece. The actors in title roles have given such extraordinarily superb performances, that it would be impertinent and disparaging to merely regard their swell work as acting. In fact their brilliant portrayals have immortalized Blondie, Sentenza/ Angel Eyes and the enigmatic Tuco. Lee Van Cleef is fiendishly unforgiving as the merciless Angel Eyes. Clint Eastwood is rugged yet suave, cocky yet adorable as laconic cigar-smoker Blondie, a role that laid the foundations of his illustrious career. But it is Eli Wallach, who steals the show with his captivating portrayal of Tuco, a portrayal that is as entrancing as it is enlightening. Wallach is amusing, capricious, nonchalant, uncanny and yet tenacious as Tuco, perturbed by his insecurities and dampened by his solitude. It is the tacit amicability between Blondie and Tuco and their mutual hostility towards the evil Angel Eyes owing to the vestiges of virtue present in them, redolent of their moribund morality, which gives the story, the impetus and the characters, a screen presence that is not only awe inspiring but also unparalleled.",v
4,25 November 2006,Steffi_P,10," ""There are two kinds of people in this world, my friend""","Sergio Leone always wanted every picture he made to be, in every way, bigger than the one which preceded it.

6,11 February 2018,gogoschka-1,10, A Cinematic Masterpiece - And Also The Most Entertaining Western Of All Time,"I'll keep this brief: This is simply one of the most entertaining and best looking westerns ever. Director Sergio Leone's unique use of the camera - long, uninterrupted shots in wide angle alternating with extreme close-ups - and Ennio Morricone's unique, wildly inventive soundtrack are blended to perfection. The career-making performances by Eli Wallach (hilarious), Lee Van Cleef (chilling) and Clint Eastwood (cool) are nothing short of iconic, and the film's finale is so good it will send shivers of cinematic joy down your spine. It's a movie of epic proportions; it's funny and violent, but underneath it all there is a strong anti-war message. It's a cinematic masterpiece and one of the most influential movies of all time. Oh, and it's also tons of fun, and you should see it on the biggest screen possible. 10 stars out of 10.",w
7,21 August 2006,dr_foreman,10, The King of Cool,"On a partial first viewing, I didn't like ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" I thought it was a slow, tedious story about a bunch of unpleasant jerk characters involved in a bog-standard conflict over money. It all seemed very macho and self-consciously cool, and it had obviously inspired all the overrated macho directors I don't like in my own generation - Tarantino, for example, and Robert Rodriguez. In short, I was unimpressed.",/
8,20 July 2018,perica-43151,10, The best Western ever made,"Filmed in Spain by Italian filmmaker, this is the best Western ever made. With Hollywood actors but fittingly, not made in Hollywood, it was despised by the mainstream at the time, but also recognized for its genius and is the most famous part of the most famous Western trilogy. Building on a rich Italian storytelling and film making tradition, with unforgettable score, this movie has justly taken the place it now holds. If you have not seen it yet, do it. Equally subversive and authentic, this is just one master piece nobody should miss.",r

12,3 October 2003,MovieAddict2016,9, Sergio Leone's most visionary film...,Sergio Leone is arguably the most visionary director of all time. They say that before he even had a written script he could picture exactly what was to be on screen and the camera's direction in leading his characters. It was Sergio's World - an alternate place in an alternate time that he was free to control. He controlled the audience and his story like no other director.,9

While I don't even think it's the best thing Sergio Leone made, it's a solid Spaghetti Western that has all but transcended the sub-genre. There are images, such as Clint Eastwood in the poncho, and music, like the main title theme, that are known by people who have never seen the movie. I also know people who wouldn't be caught dead watching a movie made outside of the USA who love The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. I can't think of another Italian made film, let alone an Italian made Western, that has become so universally known and enjoyed.",9

17,28 September 1998,slayer-3,10, Classic,"Rather than a review of a 30 year old movie, here is my recollection of a 30 year old movie. When was the first time you saw this movie? I remember the first time I saw this movie. Back in the '70s, one night there was 2 things on TV to choose from, this movie or a baseball game.  How do I remember a baseball game, it was the night Hank Aaron was going after Babe Ruth's homerun record. Baseball or a movie. Tuned into the the baseball game, flipped to the movie -a western, cool. 'Uh, what is this no one is talking it makes no sense'. After what seemed like an eternity somebody finally spoke, Lee van Cleef. The rest is Movie History. Since then I have seen this movie well over 25 times. Numerous lines that have been etched into my memory. Forget whatever minor flaws this movie has. Put yourself in the movie. Sergio Leon, John Ford these are the people that defined ""The Western"". On a scale of 1-10, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is nothing less than a 10. Plop the tape into the VCR, sit back and experience a classic.",/
18,28 May 1999,NachoDaddie,10, The world is not black and white,"Ok- first, as mentioned in another review, the geographic/historical errors in this film are GLARING. You've got men carrying revolvers that look like old style cap-and-ball pistols, but they're loading them with metallic cartridges- historically about five years early. Eastwood carries a rifle that hasn't been invented yet, Tuco assembles a ""superpistol"" out of a Colt, a Remington, and a Smith and Wesson- impossible. And there was nothing of merit taking place between the North and South during the Civil War in the Southwest. Now, that aside, I must say that this is the Greatest western ever. I first saw this film when I was about ten. I'd never sat through an entire Western befor, even though my Dad watched them constantly. Since then, I've been through film school, watched hundreds of Westerns, learned to appreciate them- but NOTHING matches up to this. The Searchers, Stagecoach, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, The Gunfighter, High Noon, Shane- all great films, but saddled with the standard American Western morality- the good guy never takes liberties with the eastern schoolmarm, the bad guy wears a black hat, etc. Coming from Italy, TG,TB &TU isn't bound by these conventions. Blondie's the ""good guy""- but he's also a bounty hunter. He makes a living in a highly immoral way, but is obviously the ""good""- not because we're told, but from small acts- giving the dying soldier a cigar, making sure the Captain knows to hold on till he hears the bridge blow, the genuine regret he feel for having to let Shorty die. And while Angel Eyes may be the Bad, we at least know he has prinicpals- when he's hired for a job, he always sees the job through. And Tuco may be more immoral than the other two, but he's so savvy and his role so humorous that one can't bring oneself to look upon him disfavorably. In other words, historical inaccuracies aside, TG, TB, & TU maybe one of the most accurate portrayals of the West ever put on film- there are no clear-cut lines of conduct, no black and white, or even grey, but just a swirled palette of various facets of the human condition.",?
19,23 August 2006,planktonrules,10," Among the finest Westerns, though not for all tastes","While I have given some pretty long reviews to Clint Eastwood's Westerns--particularly the wonderful FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, I will only give a brief review of this movie because there are so many reviews already I doubt if my pontificating will actually influence many people. After all, this is widely seen as one of the greatest Westerns ever made and since I liked it immensely, there isn't much need to say more.",r
20,25 December 2007,basrutten,10, Wonderful,"I must admit that I had some doubts prior to seeing this movie, considering its length and some people's comments that it is slow as molasses. Well, they were mostly right about that. GB & U is indeed a movie that does not always move very fast, and it does take a little getting used to. Yet if you manage to look past the slowness, this is easily one of the best movies ever made.",e
21,19 December 2022,Xstal,9, Several Fistfuls of Cadavers...,"It's a story of three people on the run, from themselves, from poverty and from the gun, all chasing golden riches, in their saddle weary breeches, one-upmanship prevents, being outdone. Angel Eyes is a hardened mercenary, always finishes a job, he won't miscarry, has his sights set on a bounty, buried in, a cemetery, but two others will become, adversaries. Tuco is a cunning, cagey outlaw, never satisfied, wanting a few dollars more, devious and double crossing, scornful, sneering, often scoffing, wears a noose more than he'd like, below his jaw. Blondie plays it cool most of the time, makes his living freeing Tuco for his crimes, with his cigar and his poncho, he's an independent honcho, though a walk around the desert leaves him begrimed.",f
22,9 December 1998,vonjenk,10, One of the Best of all Time,"This film probably had the largest impact on my life. It set the tone for everything I then got interested in. American Civil War. Film Music. Clint Eastwood. Real Westerns. This is the best of the Dollars Trilogy and by far one of the best Westerns of all time. It has drama, comedy, cracking dialogue, some of the most brutal battle scenes - especially around the bridge - that I'd seen up to then, music to die for and set pieces that just ooze atmosphere and tension. I have never forgotten the end shoot-out. This was unique; 3 people?! You can't do that. But Leone did, and he did it brilliantly - all cameras and music. I have now seen this film too many times to count but I'll be back for another blast of buono, brutto, cattivo, someday. My son owes his name to this film. Yep, that there is Clinton.",_
23,28 April 2010,johnnyboyz,10," Masterfully shot; masterfully scored; masterfully directed, Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a stunning and highly involving piece - just masterful.","Sergio Leone's 1966 Western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly unfolds under this hostile, violent and hate filled umbrella of Civil War America; a fitting backdrop of ongoing warfare and hostilities to which two American men and a Mexican bandit strive to find a large box full of valuable coins buried out in the big country somewhere behind Confederate Army lines. In using a plot item as routine as said example and applying it to a relatively routine singular strand arc for the film's narrative to take, Leone essentially breathes so much life into a set up and plot plan that about half way through you forget the basic bare bones of the movie and find yourself going with it, utterly immersed in the tale the director's laying out in front of you. So much has been written and said about the film, like other such examples at the top of each genre, that further comment and analysis may seem futile. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly may very well be the pinnacle to the western as Psycho might be to horror or Apocalypse Now to the war, for instance. If it isn't, or either of the said examples aren't, then there will still be a large cluster of individuals that would sternly argue otherwise.",=

25,18 February 2008,smatysia,10, Eastwood's iconic anti-hero,"There's not a lot to say about this one that hasn't been said. You have to enjoy the sweeping, desolate Spanish vistas. And, as it has been pointed out as a plot hole, it is an interesting technique that what ever is out of the frame, is unnoticed by the characters, such as Angel Eyes making it all the way to the Stanton grave without being noticed approaching (on horseback) over open land. I found it distracting the way many characters spoke in Spanish or Italian and were dubbed into English. I have always disliked dubbed movies and preferred subtitles, but this one was odd, with some characters speaking English, and some not. It must have made for interesting rehearsals and filming. I would have to agree with others that Eli Wallach largely stole the show. And does anyone know if Lee Van Cleef really was short part of his right middle finger, or did they splice in someone else's hand for that shootout scene?",t
26,10 August 2003,Angry_Arguer,9, Visual Literature,"Sergio Leone is an underappreciated talent.  His skill, in most cases, exceeds what he actually puts on the screen.  This is, by far, his crowning achievement and the culmination of both his work and Clint Eastwood's career.  After this, it is only pushing the plateau without success.",_
27,10 July 2007,Hancock_the_Superb,9," Fantastic, legendary masterpiece","In New Mexico Territory circa 1862, a mysterious bounty-killer known as ""Blondie"" (Clint Eastwood) and a shifty Mexican bandit, Tuco Ramirez (Eli Wallach), run a con job wherein Blondie turns Tuco in for money and then rescues him, splitting the reward money. However, the two engage in numerous double-crossings against each other, until stumbling across a dying Confederate soldier (Antonio Casale) who gives each man a clue to the location of a hidden cache of gold. Tuco and Blondie re-form their alliance to find the gold, only to find that Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless hired gun, is already after the gold. The three men form a frequently-changing series of alliances to get at the gold, and they must avoid the Union and Confederate armies operating in the region.",u
28,9 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," Nothing bad or ugly about this movie, all is good","Well what do you know? Another amazing movie from Sergio Leone. The Good, The Bad and the Ugly has so much good about it, and quintessentially it is one of the best westerns ever made. There may be nothing new about the story at first glance, but that's the point, Leone is paying homage to the Hollywood western, and despite the initial simplicity there is also a complexity mainly in the film's characters. Regardless of whether simple or complex it is, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly does have a compelling and brilliantly written story.",r
29,9 June 2014,Mr-Fusion,7," Grandiose, I'll give it that","There's a meandering nature about ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" that keeps me from enjoying it as highly as I think I should. It's certainly not as tight as ""For a Few Dollars More"", and it really tends to drag during the desert torture and the army scenes (which pop up with surprising frequency). Even the final shootout was too much; I just wanted Leone to get on with it. It's ""epic"" scope just seems to topple in on itself.",v
30,26 September 2008,dvc5159,9, Cinematic brilliance.,"A big, bravado, bold and exquisite film for its time, Sergio Leone's ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" remains one of the most seminal, influential, and exciting films of all time. With its superb cast, its beautiful and wide scenery, and its superior action sequences, this film is a masterpiece. A picture that embodies the perfect personification of masculinity. A true man's picture, and one that will stand tall among most movies today.",
31,14 August 2019,Hitchcoc,10, The Absolute Essence of Film,"Since there isn't much original that I can add, I just want to make sure that no stone is unturned. The three principles in this epic are so well developed. There are no really ""good"" guys, despite the title. But they are so well drawn that we are intrigued by the clash of spirits. It is very much like reading the Iliad. When Achilles dons the armor, he is going after another hero and must defeat one he respects. Here, respect may be the wrong word, but viable adversaries have a kind of sense of immovable object and irresistible force. There is so much violence and so many confrontations, it works so well. It, of course, got us away from the horse opera, or even the white hat of John Wayne (not to diminish the joy of those films) and created an opening for the anti-hero. What a piece of cinema.",
32,2 December 2019,umlaziking,10, This blew me away,"Why don't we get unique films like this anymore.Films that will make u think,films that will make your heart pound fast out of fear cuz of how unpredictable they are,well this movie,the good the bad and the ugly has all that.Great story,amazing characters,amazing dialogue and the amazing soundtrack from ennio,he really nailed it.This film deserves to be in imdbs top ten films of all time it surprised me so much,greatest western ever made and definitely one of the greatest films ever made.I love this movie 10 out of 10, I really hope they don't remake this masterpiece cuz it's perfect the way it is",
33,10 January 2007,Maciste_Brother,10, One of the greatest films ever made!,"And Sergio Leone had to show Hollywood how a western should be done. Earthy, gritty, moody, rambling, funny and just plain nasty too. One thing most people forget about the Sergio Leone Dollar trilogy films is that they were made when westerns were really staid and boring, with zero atmosphere and very mechanical. Then came these movies, with THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY being the last and the greatest of the three Dollar films. Cinema wasn't the same after it was released. And to show influential this film is, it transcended its ""western"" genre and influenced practically every type of films made after that. Heck, I'm not even a western fan and I thoroughly admire what Leone and the gang created here. It's big, bold, melancholic, lusty, giddy and operatic.",

35,27 November 2019,droog-56936,10, A Cultural Phenomenon,"This sprawling epic changed the way the western and cinematic gunplay was shown on film. Brutal, funny and packed with characters that flow in and out of the narrative without ever feeling disjointed or dashed together. Sergio Leone pushed the boundaries of his previous two westerns and told a tale of three men and their travails through the end of the civil war in search of the hidden gold maguffin.
The result was so revolutionary that this movie is burned in the quilt of our culture.The iconic music..Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name...the closeups..everything here is classic. Arguably the best western ever made and certainly the most ambitious.",

In TREASURE, the three men searching for the gold worked as a team. The team broke down because of external pressure (the bandits) and internal pressure (Fred C. Dobb's paranoia). In THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, the three men searching for the gold never team up. They are kept apart by internal pressure (the fact that one of them is a murdering sadist) and external pressure (the ebb and flow of the Civil War).",
38,13 August 2005,gottogorunning,10, One Of The Best Westerns Ever Made!,"This movie has style - in a very elemental way - so to speak. You get an idea of the deadly, dreary desert, the deadlier bounty hunters and the deadliest of 'em all - Clint Eastwood - the man with no name! The story is a simple one to follow and is brilliantly executed by Sergio Leone using just the right landscapes along with some pretty good sets too (like the one featuring the Civil War sequence).

Blondie and Tuco had a scam where Blondie would bring in Tuco for the reward. Just when Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie would shot Tuco down off the noose. Except the last time when Blondie double crossed Tuco and left him behind. So comrades in crime turn into enemies.

40,23 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, Epic spaghetti western with the best set-piece climax ever,"Leone's conclusion to his DOLLARS trilogy once again shows how he had progressed as a director from the previous two films - with his style now evident and developed, his pacing slowed down to a gentle speed and exactly the right combination of editing, photography, and art direction, Leone was ready to make what many consider to be his greatest film - ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. Unfortunately, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is sometimes overlooked in place of that film, and although it's only the third of a trilogy, the film still has an epic feel to it.",
41,17 July 2006,pgruendler-1,8, The Blood of Human Kindness,"Eight of Ten Stars. I was so enamored of this movie as a teen that my Northwestern University freshman dorm wall was papered with big B&W posters of mssrs. Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef in the Fall of 1968. I was quite the little existentialist then; ""If it feels good, DO IT!"" was the mantra of my high school Senior English teacher. Well, it felt good, and bad, and ugly. I ended up dropping out of Northwestern after Kent State and, taking the soundtrack of GBU (in my head) with me to Vietnam in 1971, I proceeded to get a real-world education in the old 'ultra-violence' as an infantryman in the AMERICAL Division... WHAT you may ask does this have to do with an American Civil War movie, directed and written by an Italian Communist? (Sergio Leone's daddy may have been more of a commie than Sergio was, but the fact is that ""A Fistful of Dollars"" was STOLEN from Kurosawa, while ""The Magnificent Seven"" was PURCHASED years before. The end justifies the means? Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery?) http://www.fistful-of-leone.com/classic/articles/prof.html I found out firsthand the moral ambiguities of war. If only I had paid attention to the subtext in GBU! If only I had studied the Matthew Henry battlefield dead tintypes as Leone so obviously had! His hideous, rotting carcases of Union and Confederate soldiers, bloating in direct sunlight, would have sufficiently revulsed me from any notion that I could 'play soldier' and survive! But here I am, having just barely survived.... and I just got out of the fabulous Fox Theater here in Atlanta where the restored GBU was projected in all its Technicolor/Technirama glory at fully loaded, screaming Morricone volume.... there must have been at least a thousand people there, and hardly anyone moved. INCREDIBLE. It is said that the movie was made to the tunes Morricone made prior to production's start; i.e. Leone played the music while shooting the scenes! Hence, these epics are giant music videos - fantasias - symphonic cinema- they are huge, elegiac tone poems! And, God help me, I still love this movie.",
42,28 February 2007,mjg32,9, The west as a piece of art...,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly has a very basic storyline - 3 cowboys trying to collect a fortune in gold. Sergio Leone then set this story against a backdrop of the American civil war. It is visually stunning, and has enough action for 10 films, let alone 1. Okay, so its not geographically or historically correct, but seriously, if you care about those things so much that you don't like the film, then you are just plain sad. The 3 main characters are excellent; Clint Eastwood as the laid back hero, Eli Wallach as his dirty Mexican partner and Lee van Cleef as the evil gunman who kills for a living. The whole film is like a work of art, leading up to the final gunfight in a stadium like cemetery, 1 of the best scenes in film history. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly isn't one of those films that is thought provoking, but it is one of the best simply because for 3 hours it is very entertaining, and a thing of beauty.",
43,4 July 2010,Rectangular_businessman,10, The best movie ever made,"Sergio Leone's massive epic is one of my favorite films, pitting a manic Eli Wallach as Tuco against an autistic Clint Eastwood (Leone: Eastwood has two acting emotions, with hat on and hat off). Lee Van Cleef hovers around the the center of the film menacing everyone, although his performance fades between the tension of Wallach and Eastwood. Ostensibly a story about the search for buried gold, GBU undercuts its exploitative surface by giving us almost Beckett-like relationship between a man that is wanted for murder and his partner who turns him in for the reward and then shoots the rope off his neck, a droll comment on human existence if there ever was one. Other existential moments occur in this rich film, such as the beautiful song the confederate prisoners sing while Angel-Eyes tortures Tuco, and the essay on the nature of the futility and pointless brutality of war appears when Tuco and Blondie witness a battle on a bridge they must cross.",

I love this epic movie. Patiently shot and created , it exudes a scent of eternal beauty. This is my friends every movie goer's delight. A movie which can't be bettered.

46,22 July 2006,Robert_duder,8, A simple classic and a must see by every Eastwood fan,"I have been a Clint Eastwood fan for years. But I have NEVER watched his Westerns. That's kind of idiotic isn't it?? Well suddenly I'm having an Eastwood movement and sinking myself into Westerns for the first time in my life and it only made sense that I start with what some critics and fans call ""The Greatest Western ever made."" In some respects I agree with that because it embodies everything that the Western is...even if you have never seen a Western you know the way they are supposed to go and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly encompasses every aspect of the stereotypical Western. Also a film like this has to be judged by it's release time as well and for 1966, this film's violent and gritty story would have made heads explode and Eastwood's trademark Man with No Name made Eastwood the gosh darned coolest, slickest man in history. The story explodes into an epic 3 + hour (extended cut) film about three man of completely different personalities, backgrounds, and goals trying to find a hidden treasure by a Civil War soldier and stay alive while basically beating the living daylights out of each other.

48,26 August 2010,TheUnknown837-1,10, Never before has two hours and forty minutes whipped by so fast,"""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is one of the pinnacles of my experiences of a moviegoer. Not only is it my all-time favorite Western and therefore, one of my all-time favorite movies regardless of genre, but is a landmark in the history of cinema itself. First of all, it is proof that oftentimes the simplest ideas are the best ones. The plot is fairly simple: three men try to reach a buried fortune of Army gold coins while the Civil War erupts around them. The story is even simpler and yet the audience gets wrapped around in it as 160 minutes and those 160 minutes just seem to whip by so fast that when the movie does end, we're craving for more. The film is also evidence that the Western is not a dying genre, for this landmark film from Italian director Sergio Leone has aged like wine; time has done nothing to varnish its style and authority. And it is also proof that Spaghetti Westerns, which are low in budget and oftentimes flamboyant and over-the-top, can be art, too.",
49,24 February 2006,johno-21,10, A Classic,"There are hundreds of comments here on this movie and most of them are of high acclaim which comes as no surprise to me. Many have included this in their all-time top 10 films and again it comes as no surprise. With those I agree, this is a great film. There is little I can add that hasn't been said here but I will go back to the beginning. I was a Clint Eastwood fan when I was a kid from his role as Rowdy Yates in Rawhide. When he made the Spaghetti Westerns as they were called, I of course had to see him on the big screen. A Fistfull of Dollars and A Few Dollars More were unlike the typical Hollywood Westerns of the 50's and 60's. Italian and American actors in low budget productions with overdubbed dialog filmed in Spain which was supposed to be Mexico or the US Soutwest. Heavy on style with strange music. Raw realism emerged from this strange brew and I loved them. Then this came out. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Just the title itself was so impressive you knew this was going to go to another level from the first two. And it did. Ennio Morricone's music was so different and wonderfully strange and remains so even today. It was the perfect soundtrack score for this film. Sergio Leone's direction and his story and screenplay along with Luciano Vincenzoni and cinematography by Tonio Delli Colli are superb. A great cast with Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach. Eastwood's Hang Em High and High Plains Drifter that would follow were good but they couldn't top this. I've seen this dozens of times on TV but I haven't seen it on the big screen since it's initial release. This film ran a little long but it didn't matter because this was clearly a masterpiece. And so it remains. I would give this a 10 and highly recommend it. I'd love to see it on the big screen again.",

54,19 May 2019,weezeralfalfa,8," The bad, the badder and the baddest","I submit that my review title is a more accurate descriptor of the 3 stars than the given film title. Clint Eastwood, as ""Blondie"", may be the justified ultimate victor, but I see little in him that is good. I don't like westerns with too much gun play, and too many corpses piling up. There is an abundance of both here, some justified, some not. Blondie, on several occasions just mows down a bunch of people for no reason. He tries to get extra bounty money by collaborating with escaped Mexican bandit Tuco(Eli Wallach), to deliver him to peace officers in exchange for a bounty reward, which he would later share with Tuco, after he had cut the suspending rope tied around Tuco's neck with a gun shot. Tuco would ride off on the horse he was sitting on. When they reconvened, they went to the next town and tried the same trick. But something was bound to go wrong eventually. So, Tuco stuck up Blondie and made him walk a long way across a desert with no water, and no protection from the sun. When Blondie was virtually dead, they came upon a closed wagon full of dead or nearly dead bodies. While Tuco is getting water for the one barely alive man, this man tells Blondie the name on the grave where a fortune in gold is hidden. Blondie tells Tuco he knows the relevant grave site, but not which graveyard it's in. Tuco then gives Blondie some water and shade, and they agree to eventually share the 2 parts of the puzzle..........After they have found the cache of gold coins, Blondie, not trusting Tuco, ties his hands behind his back, fashions a hanging rope, has him stand on a rickety grave cross, and puts the noose around his neck. Blondie leaves Tuco's share of gold at his feet, then rides off. Responding to Tuco's pleading, Blondie turns around , and from some distance, breaks the rope with a single shot, thus completing this redundant gag, after which Blondie continues to ride off into the sunset, while Tuco is left in this bleak waterless desert, with his hands tied behind his back,, and no horse. This was Blondie's way of extracting revenge for several transgressions of Tuco. Tuco had nearly succeeded in hanging Blondie, except for a traumatic interruption. Also, for Tuco nearly killing him by making him walk across that waterless desert. Tuco showed his sadistic side by tempting Blondie with some water, then throwing it away. Also, Tuco had tried to get to the relevant grave before Blondie, after Blondie told him where it was. Crafty Blondie told him wrong in case he had the idea to make off with all the gold. .......The occasional switch between 2 of the 3 main characters being reluctant buddies to being outright enemies is an important factor in making this an interesting western.........Angel Eyes(Lee Van Cleef) has some encounters with the other two relating to finding the treasure. At last, Blondie writes the name of the relevant grave on a rock(?), and places it in middle of a triangle formed by the 3 men. A three-way duel ensues. Blondie shoots Angel Eyes dead, and previously unloaded Tuco's gun. Thus, he is the winner, sparing Tuco's life, for the present, and awarding him half the gold, but as I previously described, Blondie imposes severe restrictions of Tuco's ability to make use of all that gold...........I think the film could have been tightened by about 30min.,to make it seem less daunting. The 3 main actors did an excellent job. Incidentally, Eastwood was a non-smoker, thus objected to having a cigarillo in the corner of his mouth in nearly every scene. However, this did contribute to his charisma.",

But another half of my mind said, ""Dude, you can't afford miss an IMDb #4 movie. So, I saw the movie and till date I have watched it at least 25 times. Hats off to Sergio Leone for making such a great and legendary movie and that too in 1966 with limited resources. None of the ""Spagetti Westerns"" are close such brilliance, not even the other 2 in this series. Leone has extracted out a stupendous performance from ""Eli Wallach"". Clint Eastwood was good as usual. Shooting locations are brilliant and the supportive background score is very catchy. The movie is a bit slow in the beginning, but once it catches pace, it deeply involves the audience. Some people have argued that #4 is too high for this movie, but its not 'some' who make the IMDb list, its the majority. Speaking of Leone, I believe that he was at least 15-20 years ahead of time. He has served as inspirations for such genre in all parts of the world, be it 'Sholay' in India, 'El Desaro' in Spain, and many more.

68,22 April 2014,ironhorse_iv,9," Hands down, the best Spaghetti Western movie ever! ""When you have to shoot, shoot! Don't talk."" Sergio Leone knows how to shoot a Spaghetti Western.","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is just amazing to watch. I'm watching the 2004 extended version, with all the delete scenes in it. Directed by Sergio Leone, this movie is the third film in the Dollars Trilogy following 1964's A Fistful of Dollars and 1965's For a Few Dollars More, serving as a prequel to them. Thank Goodness, the movie wasn't call 'The Two Magnificent Tramps', its working title. In the United States, United Artists considered using the original Italian translation, River of Dollars, or The Man with No Name, but decided on The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The title, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly suite the plot so well. The plot revolves around three gunslingers, 'the Good' AKA 'Brodie' AKA 'The Man with no name (Clint Eastwood), 'The Bad' AKA 'Angel Eyes' (Lee Van Cleef) and 'The Ugly"" Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez (Eli Wallach). All three are competing to find a fortune in buried Confederate gold during the American Civil War. All the actors in this film are great. Clint Eastwood is great. I love that the producers finally explain where his character got his trademark poncho. Granted, the other two were morally worse than him, but Blondie's not exactly a nice guy, too. It's more like 'the good enough'. I love, how Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach work with each other. Lots of chemistry there, yet a lot of backstabbing triathlon with the trio. Tuco is the only one of the trio, the audience really gets to know all about. We meet his brother and find out where he came from and why he became a bandit. The other two are more of a mysteries. The names ""Blondie"" and ""Angel Eyes"" aren't exactly threatening, but workable. Blondie's hair is sandy brown. This is due to imperfect translation from the original Italian. Mad props to Eli Wallach for doing all the dangerous stunts as he almost got killed in real life like three times during the making of this movie. Eli Wallach pretty much steals the movie with his character. Originally, Leone wanted Charles Bronson to play Angel Eyes but he was already committed to another movie, and Leone choose Lee Van Cleef as the villain, playing opposite to the character, he plays in the 'For a Few Dollars More'. I glad, Lee Van Cleef was chosen for the film. He was best as the villain. Still, it does get kinda confusing, story wise seeing how the films are supposedly connect to each other. In the theatrical trailer, Angel Eyes is referred to as The Ugly and Tuco as The Bad. This is due to a translation error; the original Italian title translates literally to ""The Good, the Ugly, the Bad"". Still, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly had tons of memorable lines, funny scenes, and epic action, but the movie is really long. It takes forever to get to the buried treasure part of the movie, even if you watching a way cut down version. Angel Eyes besides the opening, doesn't show up, until half way to the film. Lots of desert scenes that they add in the 2004 version was cut out for a good reason. The movie takes a lot of side steps missions like blowing a strategic bridge, bounty hunters, and money-schemes that were entertaining, but kinda distracting as the gold plot takes a backseat, most of the first act and second. The movie has a great sweeping widescreen cinematography by Director of photography Tonino Delli Colli. The Cemetery showdown is intense. I love how the movie is shot with all the dramatic extreme close ups to give the audience, a sense of tensed. The movie got tense, due to falling out between Leone and Clint Eastwood, as Eastwood got tired of all the camera shooting in different angles, sweeping long shots, and extreme close ups. Both never work together again, after this. I can see why Eastwood might had got upset. There is a bit too much artsy in the film, but it's not too bad. Many of Leone's trademarks, hugely influential to modern filmmakers. Unlike A Fistful of Dollars nor For a Few Dollars More, this film had a bigger budget and its shows. Mad props to the people had to build the bridge in the blowing up scene, it had to be filmed and build twice due to the camera being destroy in the first shot. Another to the crew building a cemetery, just for the Sad Hill shootout scene. The money was well-used. I love the Civil War theme. The theme shows how brutal the backdrop, the Civil War was during that time and how absurd it was. The dubbing on my version was really good. Love the Curse Cut Beep. Ennio Morricone composed the soundtrack. The main theme is turned into one for each protagonist: The Good's has a whistle, The Bad's an ocarina, and The Ugly's screamed. It works so well. 'Story of a soldier' is beautiful. It's eerily in a way, since it play during the torture scene. I also love the score, Ecstasy of Gold. It's haunting at the beginning, it draws you in, slowly. Then it smacks you in the face like a ton of bricks and voila! Depending on what version, you're watching this movie. It can take from 161 min to 186 min. The 186 minute is dubbed. If you find the 2002 extended, it's in English, but cut to 179 min. Then you have an old copy, like the 1984's version, its 142, but its cut as hell. In my opinion, just get the 2004 DVD. Tons of special features on the behind the scene production, documentaries, and additional footages like too badly damaged film negative. All of them are worth the price of 2004 DVD. Overall: One of the best cinematic film. Worth watching if haven't yet saw.",

This was my second viewing ‚Äì the first being in 2006, when my interest in cinema was still in its infancy ‚Äì and, just as Leone's film gained status only in subsequent decades, my admiration has since grown substantially. By the early 1960s, the Western had become a tired genre, and even the best American entries {such as Ford's 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)'} could more closely be described as somber rather than thrilling. Leone's low-budget Italian productions breathed new life into the Western, the director's highly-stylised (and purely cinematic) film-making style tackling the recently-emerged Revisionist Western sub-genre with a cheekily-parodic sense of humour.",
73,17 September 2010,estebangonzalez10,10, A Western Masterpiece!,"¬®You see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend, those with loaded guns, and those who dig. You dig.¬® I wonder what would've been of Clint Eastwood's career if it weren't for the ¬®Dollars¬® trilogy. Before working with Italian filmmaker, Sergio Leone, he had a career as a television actor in Rawhide, a western based TV series, but he couldn't get a decent job in Hollywood so he began to look for work abroad. He reached international success thanks to Leone's reinvented spaghetti westerns: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1966), known as the ¬®Dollars¬® trilogy. He proved producers wrong because they thought that people wouldn't pay to see movies of actors they could see for free on television, but audiences were more than willing to see him in the big screen. His pairing with Leone couldn't have worked out better for him since the director's trademark was combining long wide shots with extreme close-ups. These wide shots couldn't have been enjoyed as much on the small television sets at home. Eastwood's rough features and manly charisma also contributed to Leone's success, and both seemed destined to work with each other. There is no need to see the previous ¬®Dollars¬® movies as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly stands out on its own and is actually a prequel since the movie takes place during the Civil War in the early 1860's before the other plots take place and they are all separate stories that only have Clint Eastwood's character in common. When I see Eastwood's latest films as a director I can't help but think how much he was influenced by the great Sergio Leone. He must have learned a great deal working with the Italian director in this masterpiece. It is just shot beautifully and to perfection by Leone, the cinematography and scenery are amazing and feel real, and the score is perfect. Eastwood may be a different director than Leone was, but he pays close detail to his craft and also knows how to shoot beautifully.",

85,8 January 2020,andrewmerritt-31652,9," Not a big fan of westerns, but I like this one","The Good the Bad, and the Ugly is a spaghetti western film starring Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef. The film is directed by Sergio Leone and is the conclusion to the Dollars Trilogy, which also starred Clint Eastwood. The film centers on three outlaws who are on the hunt to find a fortune in gold buried in a cemetery. To kick-start this review off I will mention that this is the final chapter in the Dollars Trilogy. The Dollars Trilogy are three spaghetti films starring Clint Eastwood as the Man with No Name. And these three movies are major influences that have inspired countless western films to come. But unlike the first two films, I think I speak for everyone in saying that this is the film that brings a breath of fresh air to the western genre. Even though the movie is called The Good the Bad, and the Ugly, the movie does display its good, bad, and ugly side to things. I don't know if it was Sergio Leone's intention to go all out in the final chapter and have this be his magnum opus, but he needs to work on the run time. This movie is three hours and in those three hours the movie felt like it was all over the place as we focus on these three outlaws hunting for buried treasure, but then it jumps to the American Civil War. There just needed to be some common ground on whoever wrote the script, but I didn't feel any connection. And when this movie was released, people didn't like it and received criticism as well. And in a way I feel like I fit that category because I didn't like it after it was finished, but it grew on me after. But ignoring its three-hour run time, the movie does make up for its brilliant dialogue, acting, and the music department. The music does a great job building that suspense feeling and I as I was watching this zoning in and out, as soon as that theme song kicked in, I knew I was in for a ride. And that last scene alone is enough for me to say that you should definitely watch this if you're not a fan of the western genre. I'm not the biggest fan of western genres, but Clint Eastwood makes any western movie enjoyable to watch that no other western character can top Clint Eastwood's charm and charisma. So in the end, even though this movie is three hours long to the point where it bore me to tears, the movie grew on me to the point that I realize while it may not be the best movie of the western genre, its still the one western movie I would recommend watching regardless if you hate western movies.",

Personnally, I found that the synergy between Tuco and Blondie was more powerful and interesting than the two protagonists in that film. You care for Tuco, but in the same way Blondie does. In my opinion, his actor performed the best out of the trio. While I watching I couldn't stop thinking about how many newer films got inspired by his character.

(with a few exceptions...) Usually, Spaghetti westerns annoy me do to the cheesy noises, unrealistic shooting, and lots of bore. But this movie was different. Unlike the other two, this movie had lots of simple comedy. (Most from Eli Wallach's silliness and stupidity as Tuco adds a perfect sense of comic relief and Clint Eastwood's slickness and intelligence as Blondie makes him so.... cool. Lee Van Cleef does a perfect job as the villain giving a sinister performance. Instead of the fact that the slow parts in the first two movies were boring, this movie took advantage of long shots for suspense and to get a sense of things which is a great directing tool. (Kudos to Sergio Leone) I can surely see why this is #4 on the IMDb top 250. It feels more realistic than the other two movies. No whistling noises when things fall, suspenseful music(and very famous), stellar acting, and nice shoot outs. One of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies and one of my favorite westerns ever! A+. 10/10 Watch this one right away.

96,24 August 2010,zardoz-13,10, Leone's Civil War Epic with Clint Eastwood,"Italian-born film director Sergio Leone completed his western trilogy with Clint Eastwood in what constituted a prequel to the ""Dollars"" movies. ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" qualifies as a sprawling tale of greed about three men and their tenacious search for a Confederate strong box containing $200-thousand dollars in gold coins. This memorable United Artists continued a trend in Leone's filmmaking. He kept making films that were bigger and bigger. Eventually, he would make an even bigger western than ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" entitled ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" Previously, Leone's first oater ""Fistful of Dollars"" had been produced on a shoestring budget and shared sets with another Continental western lensed in Spain. When Leone produced ""For Few Dollars More,"" he imported a second American actor, veteran heavy Lee Van Cleef, and commissioned art director Carlo Simi to construct an entire western town in Almeria, Spain. Reportedly, the El Paso town set cost more than the budget for ""Fistful of Dollars."" Meanwhile, Van Cleef reunited with Leone and Eastwood for ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" and Leone imported yet another American actor. Eli Wallach, who had played the bandit chieftain in John Sturges' classic ""The Magnificent Seven,"" signed on as the third American actor. Essentially, Leone cast Eastwood again as a bounty hunter designated as ""The Good"" and called him 'Blondie,"" while Van Cleef played ""the Bad,"" and Wallach appeared as ""the Ugly."" ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" became Leone's most expensive western to date and he set the action against the American Civil War. Naturally, all three eponymous characters are a little larger than life themselves. The relationship between the Eastwood as well as the Van Cleef character changed drastically because Van Cleef was not playing Colonel Douglas Mortimer. Ironically, Van Cleef's character was named 'Angel Eyes,' and he made his living as a man who hunts down other men and kills them for a price. No, ""the Bad"" isn't a bounty hunter. Meantime, ""the Good"" brings in a slimy, profane Mexican bandit named Tuco. He collects the reward on Tuco's head, and later shoots the noose from around Tuco's neck, so the slippery Mexican can escape. Later, Blondie and Tuco split the money. This relationship comes to an end because Blondie doesn't think that Tuco will be worth more than $3-thousand. Clocking in at 180 minutes, ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" bristles with shoot-outs. Live is cheap in the world of the Italian western and the horses outnumber the corpses. Money means everything. The three protagonists refuse to let a national catastrophe like the Civil War interfere with their plans to find the cashbox. Eventually, they do and confront each other in a massive graveyard to shoot it out. Anybody who considers himself or herself a connoisseur of Spaghetti westerns must watch ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" This savage western made quite an impression on audiences when it was released and Grammy Award-winning composer Ennio Morricone's orchestral soundtrack emerged as a hit on American music charts.",

Van Cleef as Angel eyes is pure perfection as the villain ( The Bad) and the brilliant Eastwood was born to play the role of Blondie ( The Good ). It has one of the greatest movie scores in history by the fantastic Moraccone (RIP) and gives you goosebumps when watching certain scenes when the music hits.

It's an epic, the wide frame capturing both the sweeping vistas of war-torn America and the weary lines snaking across the faces of its seedy inhabitants, and it's masterfully helmed throughout. Another big draw of the long-winded narrative - which loses all but a modicum of its steam when the feature takes an extended detour into an admittedly visually stunning yet narratively unnecessary large-scale battle just before the final confrontation - is the amorality of the three equally charismatic leads, the titular labelling of whom is thankfully rather arbitrary (given that Eastwood's nameless protagonist is awarded the 'good' moniker 28-minutes in after he's just left a man for dead in the middle of the desert), and their constant double-crosses and back-stabs makes for an interestingly unpredictable ride.

Now that's what i call Real Men's Cinema. No love story, no melodrama, no emotions just the bullets and machoism till the last stage. A real man would love this film more than any other love triangle story with women and Romance involved in it or a happy go lucky film because this is stuff made only and only for Men. I doubt any such particular film was ever made for Women or will ever be made. We Men are lucky, aren't we? Possibly, it is the Spaghetti western which was better than many big budget films in the genre. I can sense so many nuances in the screenplay where the hero proves that this is how a real man should be. The other 2 guys doesn't care much about anything but money. Clint Eastwood as The Good proves what the real Good means even in bad encounter. Lee Van Cleef as the Bad brings the cruelty into the character whereas Eli Wallach as Tuco AKA the Ugly did exceptionally well. If i have to mention some iconic scenes then i would go with the introduction scene of all 3 guys in the film. One can do anything if he is paid, other one is lusty for money and the 3rd guy is one hell of a good fella, doesn't matter what the situation is. Other than that, there are multiple situations which i can say are influential and iconic and have inspired so many action films over the years. The Background score which is still giving me chills. The Good The Bad and The Ugly is well known as Sergio Leone most hard-hitting work and totally different vision to look at a western film. The distinctive use of violence, cold blooded encounters, stylistic bullets fires and machoism of the lead hero all these things surely makes The Good The Bad and The Ugly a Classic Western Action film. And like i said, if you're bored of typical romance, unnecessary melodrama and mainstream dramas then this film is the most different experience for you just like it was for entire generation of 60s Cinema Lovers.

121,2 August 2019,Horst_In_Translation,8," The good, the better and the best","""Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo"" or ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is an Italian co-production that is in the original also in the English language and was released back in 1966, so this one is over half a century old now already, which sadly means that almost all of the people working on it are (long) gone. But first things first. The director here is Sergio Leone and he is also one of many people working on the screenplay here. The movie runs for considerably over 2 hours and there are many versions out there, one of them even crossing the 3-hour mark. The cast includes many well-established actors and the big name by today's standards is of course Clint Eastwood who was in his mid-30s when this was made. Maybe Eli Wallach (who almost turned 100 before his death not too long ago) is also still known to many and maybe even Lee Van Cleef, who did not get as old as the other two. These three play the main characters in this movie we got here, the three mentioned in the title. And there is a nice introduction so we know who is who. And the ugly even gets another quick mention near the end, maybe because his one at the beginning was so short. Honestly we learn a lot more about the ugly in the introduction of the good than in his own introduction. Or maybe he gets the one at the end because in my opinion he was just the most memorable of the three and Eli Wallach also gave the best performance in the movie. Already how effortlessly he looked like a Hispanic was impressive because he really was a Jew. And he is also the one who kept this film from becoming too serious because his character always brought in some comedy value and even during these moments when Eastwood makes a short funny one-liner like along the lines of ""idiots they are talking to you"" Wallach is present and his body language adds a lot to the fun element. But people should not mistake Tuco for a fool. He may not be educated or a leader, but he makes up for it with grit determination and also ruthlessness. And there is also a soft side to him, he is not as cold-blooded as Sentenza, who would kill anybody if he had to. Tuco's soft side is especially brought out by his brother as we see during one scene and despite being a ruthless killer he believes in God and salvation it seems. He also mostly really only kills those who did something bad to him first, such as Eastwood's character, but also Sentenza's big henchman.",

A few years ago it all clicked. I became a big fan of Spaghetti Westerns and the genius of Sergio Leone. Leone was a true master. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is great epic filmmaking. There are tons of classic moments in this movie. If this movie has a flaw, it's the running time. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is a long movie that feels long at times.

Just spent the last few nights watching the Dollars ""Trilogy"" for the first time and only because they're deemed classics.

It certainly was and tremendously better than ""Part 2,"" FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. Interesting story, some unexpected humor, a fantastic score and real good characters portrayed by both Eastwood and Wallach. Definitely went on too long, as each movie in the sorta trilogy got progressively, and unnecessarily, longer. Probably by minor opinions, UNFORGIVEN was my first Clint Eastwood western and remains my favorite of his. On a side note, it sometimes makes for unintentional hilarity, when your first introduction to either a theme or clich√© in a spoof or homage. Much like: I watched the AUSTIN POWERS movies first and repeatedly long before I watched all of the James Bond movies they mimicked and unfortunately, that made the Bond movies often hilarious when they weren't meant to be.

Naturally, Leone regulars Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef bring the goods as remotely feuding foils with a penchant for sharp, icy glares; though I preferred their dynamic in the preceding For a Few Dollars More, the two make for a stunning combination whenever they share the screen and it's a shame this marks the end of that brief partnership.

135,14 November 2011,dee.reid,10," Good, better, best!","The legendary ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" It was a long time coming - ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (1964) was good, ""For a Few Dollars More"" (1965) was better but the best of Sergio Leone's ""spaghetti western"" ""Dollars trilogy"" was/is ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" released in 1967. The last film in Leone's ""Dollars"" trilogy is best remembered for two things: for truly being the best film Leone was capable of directing at that time, and for making star Clint Eastwood a household name (he'd been rising overseas due to his starring roles in the two previous ""Dollars"" films). (Eastwood, of course, wouldn't become a big-league Hollywood star until ""Dirty Harry"" in 1971.) The legendary ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is set during the Civil War, and concerns three men's quest for a fortune in Confederate gold buried somewhere in a cemetery. The three men are: The Man With No Name/Blondie/""The Good"" (Eastwood), Angel Eyes/""The Bad"" (Lee Van Cleef), and Tuco/""The Ugly"" (Eli Wallach). All three have itchy trigger fingers but therein lies the problem: they all know the secret to the location of the buried Confederate gold (one knows the cemetery, but not the grave; another knows the name of the grave but not the cemetery). This film, in its full-length unedited 179-minute running time, may very well be the first epic (spaghetti) western, or at least, the first epic western that I've seen. It's one of the most thoroughly engaging, action-packed, and provocative films I've ever had the pleasure of watching. At center stage is star Clint Eastwood, playing the ""Man With No Name"" for the third and probably last time, and he's at the top of his game here as a truly bad-a** anti-hero. Sure, he speaks softly, but he carries a big six-shooter and he knows how to use it! But don't overlook the contributions of co-stars Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach. It's been a while since I've been so thoroughly captivated by someone as truly evil and sadistic as Van Cleef's steely-eyed killer Angel Eyes; there is also something to be said about Eli Wallach's portrayal of the unkempt, desperate con man Tuco, who also serves as this film's comic relief. Leone was at the peak of his skill in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" clearly the best film of his ""Dollars trilogy."" His love of wide-angle shots to capture the oppressive desert landscape, and intense close-ups of the actor's faces were unmatched here. It's also the best film of his to make truly excellent use of the extensive talents of the brilliant Italian composer Ennio Morricone (I'm listening to his score for this film right now as I type this up).",
136,23 November 2010,mjneu59,9, the yardstick used for measuring Spaghetti Westerns,"The quintessential Spaghetti Western put some teeth back into a dying genre, recognizing the American Frontier for what it really was: a patchwork of legends and lies best recreated through broad exaggeration. The result here is a ruthless, violent, oddly skewed facsimile, spread out across a Techniscope landscape with enough dramatic flourishes to suggest a larger-than-life parody. The title roles are played, respectively, by Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach, who steals the film with his brash comic performance, but the real star to emerge from the film was director Sergio Leone himself. All of his now familiar stylistic tics are on display: the portentous wide-angle compositions; the sweaty close-ups; and the director's trademark, patented gun duels, featuring ten minutes of relentless crosscutting between beady eyes and itchy trigger fingers, while Ennio Morricone's classic music score builds to a typically overwrought frenzy on the soundtrack. The body count is surprisingly low (not including the soldiers killed during the geographically imprecise Civil War battle scene), and Leone was already learning the power of myth, testing the waters for his next and last great Western epic: 'Once Upon A Time in the West'.",

The plot line is meandering and it's simply too long for the content. By the time that both Eastwood and Leoni had gotten this far, they had both ""made it"" in professional terms. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly was the first studio (UA) financed film that Eastwood had starred in and Leoni had produced/directed. Eastwood's role as the man with no name was beginning to jump the shark in this movie and he correctly decided not to appear in Leoni's following movie, Once Upon A Time in the West. For sure it contains iconic scenes, which are often beautifully photographed, but also contains sadistic violence, which even now I find shocking.

It's simply one of the greatest comedic performances in film history.

Much of this is due to the fact that Wallach is, simply put, one of the best and most versatile actors of the last six decades, but much also has to be granted to the film's screenplay, penned by Leone, Agenore Incrocci, and Furio Scarpelli, from a story by Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni.

He is ruthless in his fad moments, but like the other two characters, he is incapable of making plans. Bad is the dictionary meaning of charisma. Disciplined enough to do his job properly.

190,22 October 2022,tiantianmk,7, It can be better,"I think it can be better. The story is meant to be unfolded with 3 protagonists, but actually only two are the actual heroes (antiheroes). I don't really see the correspondence between the Bad and the other two, which made it quite confusing when I was expecting three persons' story intertwined. The Bad is quite static and two dimensional. Tuco is a successful character though. I see his personality fully elaborated and almost all of his behaviors are explained with his history. The best part is when he met his priest brother and said something like ""from where we were born, the only ways to survive are either to be a priest or a bandit."" It is like a response to Stendhal's The Red and The black where the situation is either to be a priest or an aristocrat. The time sets in civil war America, where aristocracy life is out of the picture. That plot alone evolved Tuco from a dumb gangster to a complex and somewhat lovely character who we can sympathize. While the Good, although better depicted than the Bad, is not very successful neither. The storyteller apparently wanted to make his line a crucial thread, but we still don't know why he is the good one. He is not any better than Tuco, because they all kill people for a living. Sometimes he cares for others but that's not enough to turn our perspective on him from bad to good. Yup, he is attractive, but still - not enough. None of his history is told, so we don't have any evidence to understand his conducts as a whole. It's a pretty nice western though, but I do think there can be more. It can be so much better.",

3. The set and costume design is brilliant thus making the world-building perfect and entirely immersive.

5. Both Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach (Tuco) give great performances.
6. The action scenes are wholly entrancing and they're brilliantly choreographed.
7. The humour is dry but hilarious, and it's intelligently placed thus it never feels forced or inappropriate.
8. The atrocities and horrors of the American Civil War (1861-1865) are handled deftly, which allows for some genuinely heart-warming and tender moments.
9. The last 15 minutes can be summarised as succinctly as this: perfect cinema.",
193,27 September 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,9," A great western, but drags a little too much, especially on repeated viewings","This, the third and final part of Sergio Leone's famous ""Dollars"" or ""Man with no name"" Trilogy was promised to be the epic chapter; that proves to be entirely true. However, despite Leone's talented direction, the film seems to drag in some scenes, and the length is almost unbearable on multiple viewings. The plot is very good, intricate, yet simple enough for the mainstream crowd; the way it keeps developing through twists and unexpected situations is also great. It keeps your interest, at least the first few times you see it. The pace is bad in some scenes, where the movie seems to drag on endlessly. I don't think I've been able to sit through the whole thing more than once(granted, technically that's enough, but a film should have some re-watch value, I think). The acting is very good; Clint Eastwood is the embodiment of the spaghetti-western spirit. Lee Van Cleef is excellent as well, as is Eli Wallach. The characters are well-written, interesting and credible. The direction is, as always when it comes to Leone's films, excellent. Apart from the few scenes where the plot drags, Leone keeps a great atmosphere and mood throughout the film. The action is about as good as it gets when it comes to spaghetti-western: excellent, intense and very, very cool. The dialog is excellent. The script is well-written. The soundtrack is among Ennio Morricone's best work. All in all, if you're into westerns at all, this is pretty much *the* western. It drags a little too much in a few scenes, though, and is probably best enjoyed if you only see it once. I recommend it to any fan of westerns, particularly spaghetti-westerns, as well as any of the three main actors, or Sergio Leone. 9/10",

I was sick and tired of that little piece used for blondie. It got old quickly. The other main issue with it was the whole war scene. It felt so out of place and I feel as if it gave Leone a reason to throw a schmaltzy anti-war message into the film. I did not enjoy that scene and it felt forced and out of character for both the characters and did not fit into the movie. I did enjoy the little quips between blondie and ""the ugly"". Their dynamic was enjoyable. I do enjoy the sweeping epics with huge shots showing off the landscape. I watched this movie when it was 90 out and I felt like I could really feel the oppressive heat. The desert actually felt like the fourth character in a way that does not happen that often. The acting was alright even though it was over the top. I did enjoy all of the movie with the exception of the one scene. I really liked the opening and it really showed how to slowly build tension. The movie as a whole was extremely well paced with bits of action thrown in there to keep up an overall slow movie. It never felt slow to me and I really just enjoyed looking around.

As usual Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone are indescribable, in particular the last 15 minutes are outstanding as far as direction, score and also editing. And that final showdown is fantastic: 5 minutes of music and looks that keeps you on the edge of your seat, really memorable. The only complaint I have is that even if the movie is a great time, in some points I felt its length. Everything is necessary, I wouldn't have cut anything because of the setting in the middle of the secessionist war and so the movie takes its time to show the repercussions of it. But as I said sometimes I felt it too long. But that's not a big problem, indeed I really enjoyed ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" and if you like the genere you should definitely watch it.",

I have been a devout fan of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY for the better part of fifty years. Basically, it's a tale of human nature at its worst, and under the worst conditions possible --the desert expanse. In rides the legendary Man With No Name, superbly played by another screen legend, Clint Eastwood, who must deal with two bandidos, equally played to the hilt by Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. The rest is cinematic history. A morality play, true, and then some, but an exercise in film-making at its very best, with superb character development, a dynamic script and excellent casting, right down to the bit players. A true labor of love. An interesting side note is that Italian director Sergio Leone may have taken notes from Alfred Hitchcock's films, and incorporated them into his western series, as there is, most definitely, a black comedy side to this classic that will stick with you for awhile. Indeed! Best line goes to Eli Wallach, delivered while he is in a bathtub(!) no less.... ""If you're going to shoot, shoot! Don't talk!"" See to believe, if you haven't already.",

The story is exciting. There is never a dull moment. The movie is long, but Leoni's direction is so good that one can enjoy this movie for three hours. If you haven't seen this movie, rent it.

Angel Eyes, is a hit-man who always gets his assignment done...usually in a sadistic manner. Tuco is a Mexican bandito always looking out for his own interest...without a conscience. These three are looking for Confederate gold worth $200,000. The cache is buried in a nameless grave...but who will be the first to get his hands on it? The finale proves borderline hypnotic as Tuco pathetically runs in circles through the graveyard looking for the hidden treasure. This surely ranks with the best westerns of all time.

230,6 March 2007,drystyx,3," Except for music, Wallach, and Van Cleef, how not to make a Western","This isn't the worst of the spaghetti films, but it is a terrible films. If you don't know what a spaghetti film is, it means, great exciting music trying to make up for a weak stupid plot, uninteresting, unlikable characters, silly comic book style gunfights, terrible writing, terrible directing, and slow paced boredom. This film isn't a complete bomb because of the efforts of some of the actors. It's no secret that Eastwood wasn't a gifted actor, and he had to be surrounded by superior actors such as Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. Those two, and the supporting cast almost make this bearable. It involves three men. One is good, one is bad, and one is the guy who took your last girlfriend away from you. But which is which? The film literally has to tell you. Eastwood is supposed to be good, but the only two not completely vicious things he does are try to save a handicapped from hanging (so he can take him to be executed again), and offering a dying soldier a puff from his cigar-not trying to stop his bleeding or even give him some pain killer, but to just do a cigarette commercial in the middle of a movie. There's no reason to care about him at all. In fact, the guy who stole your girlfriend comes across as almost sympathetic (almost.) The plot is the three are after a decent amount of gold. The trouble they go through, they could've much easier just stolen that much cash somewhere is. So the plot is ludicrous. The characters are just an example of that era's movie making in which movie makers tried to outdo each other with evil characters. Billed as anti-heroes, they don't come close to filling that role. True anti-heroes are self absorbed, maybe somewhat selfish, probably anti-social, such as in ""Hombre"", ""The Lost Continent"", and the Edmond O'Brien version of ""DOA"". These guys are just vicious punks who you would not want to be your boss, your law enforcement official, your anything. That said, there is some great music, which doesn't match up at all with the mundane events and characters. The shootout scenes are ridiculous, probably comical, and unfortunately they paved the way for a multitude of later movies that copied these inferior techniques. For exciting shootouts you really need to go way back before these movies, or to more modern movies that know better. This cannot be construed in any way as a good movie, much less a classic. You will be bored to tears if you let one of these guys talk you into watching it. These are the same guys who would take you on a snipe hunt.",

Was this the consummate 'spaghetti western?' Hell ‚Äì I don't know, and I really don't give a rat's rear. There were so many of these flicks made and they all had some sort of redeeming quality (usually lots of gun-play.) This movie is the last of the ""Dollars Trilogy"", directed by Sergio Leone (at least that is what ""Wikipedia"" is telling me). I really can't remember what the movie was about - I just know I enjoyed it. Oh I guess I should try and remember what the plot of this film actually was. Hmmmm, let me see, I think the story was about bad guys shooting at the good guys, good guys shooting at the bad guys¬ÖBUT no one ever shot at Clint. If you did, he would chew on his cigar a little, and then blow you away. Mr. Eastwood could hit anything with his six-gun. Six-gun? What a misnomer ‚Äì he never had to reload. He always shot the straightest and fastest. No one stood a chance. And that is about it. That is pretty much the plot and the story of, ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.""

237,5 November 2006,tonyjackie,10, The greatest western ever,"The first thing to say about this movie is that it is probably a prequel to the first two dollar movies.I say this because towards the end of the movie Clint Eastwood's character actually finds the poncho that he wears in the first two films. This is a great movie and in my opinion the finest western ever.I think that it has gained respect critically with each passing decade and rightly so.It comes in at almost three hours and it really does need to be that long. What is so great?The three leading actor's are all top notch here.Clint Eastwood fits the role to perfection,Lee Van Cleef oozes menace and Eli Wallach chews up every scene he is in in probably his best loved role.The story is basically a hunt for missing gold set against the backdrop of the American Civil War and is beautifully told.Then there is the music which is tremendous throughout. This is a pretty long and violent journey but boy is it worth it.The final 30 minutes of the film are tremendous and the final shoot out grips with tension.I remember the first time I saw it and couldn't believe that Clint could possibly leave poor old Tuco to hang in the middle of the graveyard and even though the character of Tuco is a bit of a swine I was really pleased Clint decided to save him after all.",
238,15 November 2005,jboothmillard,10," The Good, the Bad and the Ugly","I had not seen the ""Spaghetti"" Western Trilogy, directed by Sergio Leone (A Fistful of Dollars, Once Upon a Time in the West, Once Upon a Time in America), for many years, and it made perfect sense to watch them again during the 90th birthday of the leading star. Basically, set during the American Civil War, a trio of bounty hunters attempt to kill fugitive Mexican bandit Tuco Ram√≠rez, ""the Ugly"" (Eli Wallach). Tuco shoots the three bounty hunters and escapes on horseback. Elsewhere, mercenary Angel Eyes, ""the Bad"" (Lee Van Cleef) interrogates former Confederate soldier Stevens (Antonio Casas), to find out about the new name of Jackson, a fugitive who has stolen and hidden bags of gold. Steven tells Angel Eyes that Jackson is using the new name Bill Carson. Stevens offers the bounty hunter $1,000 to kill Baker (Livio Lorenzon), his employer. Angel Eyes takes the money, but kills Stevens, fulfilling his contract. He then returns to Baker, collects his fee for killing Stevens, and then, shoots Baker. Meanwhile, Tuco is rescued from three bounty hunters by a drifter, a ""Man with No Name"" to whom Tuco refers as ""Blondie"" (Clint Eastwood), who takes him to the local Sheriff (John Bartha) to collect his $2,000 bounty. As Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie sets Tuco fre, shooting the noose. The two escape on horseback and split the bounty in a lucrative money-making scheme. They repeat the process in another town for more reward money. Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints and abandons him without horse or water in the desert. Tuco manages to walk to a village, and tracks Blondie down. He plans to force him to hang himself before Union forces distract him, and Blondie is able to escape. Tuco manages to recapture Blondie and forces to walk across the desert until he collapses from dehydration. As Tuco prepares to shoot him, he sees a runaway carriage. Inside are several dead Confederate soldiers and a near-death Bill Carson (Antonio Casale), who promises Tuco $200,000 in gold, buried in a grave in Sad Hill Cemetery. Tuco demands to know the name on the grave, but Carson collapses from thirst before answering. When Tuco returns with water, Carson has died, but Blondie, slumped next to him, reveals that Carson told him the name on the grave before dying. Tuco is now motivated to keep Blondie alive, he gives him water and takes him to a nearby mission to recover. After Blondie's recovery, the two leave in Confederate uniforms from Carson's carriage, but Union soldiers capture them and take them to the prisoner of war camp of Batterville. Tuco answers to the name ""Bill Carson"" during roll call, gaining the attention of Angel Eyes, disguised as a Union sergeant. Angel Eyes tortures Tuco, who reveals the name of the cemetery, but confesses that only Blondie knows the name on the grave. Knowing he will not talk if tortured, Angel Eyes offer Blondie an equal share of the gold and a partnership. Blondie agrees and rides out with Angel Eyes and his gang. Tuco is packed on a train to be executed, but escapes. Blondie, Angel Eyes, and his henchmen arrive in an evacuated town; Tuco eventually makes his way to the same town. Tuco takes a bath, during which he is surprised by one of the earlier three bounty hunters, Elam (Al Mulock), but he manages to shoot him dead. Blondie investigates the gunshots and finds Tuco, they agree to resume their old partnership. The pair kill Angel Eyes's men, but Angel Eyes himself has escaped. Tuco and Blondie travel toward Sad Hill, but their way is blocked by a battle between Union troops and the Confederates. Blondie decides to destroy the bridge to disperse the two armies and allow them access to the cemetery. As they wire the bridge with explosives, Tuco suggests they share information, in case one person dies before he can help the other. Tuco reveals the name of the cemetery, while Blondie says ""Arch Stanton"" is the name on the grave where the gold is buried. After the bridge explodes, the armies disperse. On their way, Blondie finds a dying soldier, but is unable to help him, he takes a poncho following the young man's death. Tuco steals a horse and rides to Sad Hill to claim the gold for himself, but Blondie fires a cannon, causing him to fall, and fires further to intimidate him. Tuco eventually makes it to the cemetery and runs, passing the various graves, to find the named grave marker. He finds the name Arch Stanton and begins digging, and Blondie arrives and encourages him at gunpoint to continue. Moments later, Angel Eyes surprises them both. Blondie opens Stanton's grave, revealing only a skeleton, no gold. Blondie states that he lied and offers to write the real name of the grave on a rock, placing it face-down in the courtyard of the cemetery, challenging Tuco and Angel Eyes to a three-way duel. The trio stare each other down in a Mexican standoff. Everyone draws, and Blondie shoots and kills Angel Eyes, while Tuco discovers that his own gun was unloaded by Blondie the night before. Blondie reveals that the gold is actually in the grave beside Arch Stanton's, marked ""Unknown"". Tuco digs and elated to find the six bags of gold pieces, but Blondie holds him at gunpoint. He orders him into a hangman's noose, standing balanced precariously on top of an unsteady grave marker beneath a tree. Blondie takes half the gold and rides away. As Tuco screams for mercy, Blondie returns into sight. From the distance, Blondie fires a rifle shot at the rope, dropping Tuco, alive but tied up, onto his share of the gold. Tuco curses loudly while Blondie rides off into the horizon. Eastwood as the iconic ""Man with No Name"" is cool, looking steely eyed, smoking cigars, wearing a few different costumes, ending in his iconic poncho, it is said most of his dialogue was cut to make him more mysterious, this third and final film cemented him as an international superstar. The film does have lip-sync and dubbing issues, it is admittedly long, but for Eastwood, the likeable Wallach, the Civil War battle sequence, the violence, the final showdown, and the memorable score by Ennio Morricone, this is a fantastic classic western. Clint Eastwood was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and the film was number 46 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!",

241,28 November 1999,Bob-45,9, Best Film ABOUT the Civil War Ever Made,"During his 25 years as a director, Sergio Leone directed only eleven films.  Remarkably, eight rate a 7.0 or better among IMDB members, and five are the on the IMDB Top 250 film all time best list!  GB&U is the highest rated of Leone films by IMDB subscribers.  GB&U is also the final segment of the most successful western trilogy ever made, the ""man with no name"" series; though GB&U is a prequel to the first film, A FISTFULL OF DOLLARS.  Narratively, I've always felt GB&U is the weakest of the series.  However, now that I have seen the DVD version with the excised scenes, I believe it is the strongest.  Two scenes in particular tie the film together.  The first, and most crucial, is a scene where Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) visits a battle-damaged Confederate fort and is told the best place to find ""Bill Carson"" (if he is alive) is in the Union P.O.W. camp. So Angel Eyes appearance later in the film at the camp as the chief jailer makes sense.  The second excised scene shows Tuco (Eli Wallach) taking the horribly dehydrated Blondie (Clint Eastwood) to the nearest confederate camp, and finding out the mission where his brother lives is nearby.  Now, Tuco's assuming the identity of ""Bill Carson"" makes much more sense.",

Because If you haven't seen one of those films before, there is an intimidating side of them, you just feel apprehensive. To an outsider, they all look similar, as if every image you have seen about any western film belongs to one single film. They look kind of boring. And now that I have seen this film, I can tell that it was a great experience. Of course, I cannot make general statements about the genre just because I've seen one film. But seeing this broke my prejudice. And even if you feel like you can never enjoy western, you should make an exception to see this one. Having said that, I must warn you it is a slow burner. First half hour was a challenge for me, but after that it started to get interesting. So I advice patience.",
244,15 June 2007,glenxxvi,10, probably the best western ever made,"i first saw this film in about 2003. i had seen A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE on the television and i thought they were really good so i decided to buy them on DVD. Searching the shops for them i found that they came in a box set with a third film, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY. I hadn't seen THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY at the time but I liked the first two so I thought that I would buy the whole box set, as that was all that was available at the time. What I didn't realise until after I watched all three was how great THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was and I thought that the first two were good. it turned out that THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was the best of the three. THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was probably the only film I had ever bought on DVD without having seen it before and I'm SO glad I did. This film is excellent and although i have seen it many times it still stands up well after multiple viewings. it may be nearly three hours long but it is never boring. all the elements work so well (music, acting, dialogue, setting etc...) i can't really find fault in it. i liked it so much i bought the special edition DVD just to see the extra footage incorporated into the film. if you've not seen this, then rent it because i guarantee you'll soon be buying it shortly afterwards",
245,8 August 2009,johnmschofield,10, Superbly Atmospheric,This is one those films that most people could watch today and it wouldn't matter that it was made over forty years ago. For me it is almost three hours of excellent entertainment. I watch it every now and then but not obsessively. It is like an old reliable friend who comes round and is completely welcome. You know how pleasurable it is going to be while the friend is around and you enjoy the company immensely. You can watch this film twenty times and still notice something which you had missed previously. I enjoy this film for how it is I am not concerned or irritated by the historical errors or any other errors which may have been made. It is just so atmospheric you can almost feel the emotions on screen. In order to appreciate it more maybe you should watch the other two films first 'a fistful of dollars' and 'a few dollars more' but only because they were made in that order. There is violence in the film but the mere fact that the action is set during the American Civil War period is enough of a guide as to the content. In conclusion it is visual treat and is one of the best films ever made. Please watch it and enjoy the experience.,

Director Sergio Leone (Dollars trilogy, Once upon a time in the west) takes his time to tell the story. He uses different types of camera angles, extreme close ups etc. The close ups are amazing. Facial expressions are very key to this movie which has very little dialogue at times. When I saw this first on a VHS as a kid, i was blown away by Ennio morricones score.

253,30 April 2008,Aomalle27,10, The Definitive western....,"A truly magnificent 3 hour long tale of three bandits, on the trail of half a million dollars in stolen confederate gold. Clint Eastwood is Blondie, a mercenary gunman who partners up with the Mexican bandit Tucco (Eli Wallach) to play a con on several different western towns. Tucco plays the part of captured bandit, Blondie the part of bounty hunter who has captured the wanted criminal. Subsequently he collects the reward, and Tucco is to be hung. But being a con, naturally Blondie just shoots Tuccon down off the hangman's rope, and into the sunset they ride to their next con job. Into the fray rides Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef playing the role to menacing perfection), a ruthless killer on the trail of the stolen gold after two of the thieves turn on each other, both hiring Angel Eyes to murder the other. He may be a ruthless killer, but he does have a perverted sense of honor, and thus fulfills both contracts, but not before one of the men tells him the story of the stolen gold, and whom he should seek out to get it, another thief in on the heist, who has now joined up with the Confederate army. As the broad backdrop of the Civil War rages on, we are given a microcosm of the conflict with not two, but three competing sides. What's interesting here is the dichotomy of the characters being almost mirror images of one another. Each a skilled gunman, and proficient killer. However, what separates the three is the degree of morality each has; Blondie killing only when necessary, when he's confronted with no other choice. Tucco kills for convenience, his life of crime has made him many enemies, so he's often faced with the end result, those out for revenge. But Tucco has a softer side, and we see several revelations about his upbringing that place him in a somewhat more heroic light than he first comes across as. Finally, there's Angel Eyes, a demonic killer with no empathy, sympathy or moral direction. He's out to get everything in life for himself, and will sell out anyone that tries to stop him. He delights in torture, but seldom sullies his own hands. He prefers to let others do the dirty work, and enjoys the spoils. I really think he's a representation of the Devil. Someone that enjoys manipulating, killing and causing chaos. A being totally involved with the pleasures of life regardless of the cost to others. The film's climax with a Mexican standoff is priceless, and the entire film is a enjoyable, riveting experience that should be on the beginners list for Western film viewing. Interestingly enough, it is so deep and nuanced, it can easily go onto an Experts list for WEstern viewing as well.",

Consistently witty, often moving, brutally realistically ugly, and one of the most beautiful films ever shot, set to one of the most beautiful scores. The 's paghetti' label on the can means that these westerns will never get the consideration and respect they deserve. If you fancy thinking a little differently about 'T he Good, The Bad and The Ugly', try the following. Look past Clint Eastwood's legend-founding performance and suppose that the central character is actually Eli Wallach's Tuco, the Ugly. A gross rogue, guilty of every possible vice, Tuco is after all the character we see and hear the most, about who m we learn the most, and through whom we experience much of the action. Eli Wallach makes him comic, poignant, and plausible - certainly compared to the unrestrained darkness of Lee Van Cleef and the impossible cool of Eastwood. The film is largely Tuco's struggle to survive, and to earn a little on the side, constantly battered between Eastwood's ""blo nd Angel"" and Van Cleef's angel of death. Angels? Indeed: Tuco is ultimately human, and Tuco is all of us - grubby, corrupt, uncomfortable and slightly desperate humans, veering between the good and the bad, subject to a perplexing God and an unrelenting Devil, and just trying to muddle along.",

This film also has one of the best villains of all time angle eyes also Tuco does a great job too. I must this film is a true masterpiece due to it's classic feel to and having the best gunfight ever. I highly recommend this film to anyone and if you like this one I highly recommend Sergio Leone Other Films.",

270,6 November 2020,mikavir,10," ""How is you digestion now?""","The third part of Dollars Trilogy The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is the longest and maybe the most profound of them. Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone have created very versatile movie by using emotional music and exciting situations at the same time. The Actors are the best quality you can get.
A bounty hunter Blondie (Eastwood), a bandit Tuco (Wallach) and a mercenary Angel Eyes (Cleef) are main characters. Blondie and Tuco hear about a big sum of hidden Confederate coins. They don't trust each other and both don't tell their own part of secret to another. Angel Eyes who is a member of Union Army hears about the coins too. At Sad Hill Cemetary where the coins are the trio determines who will take the coins by guns.
The last gunfight is the best scene in Western movies. Music and direction of that scene are absolutely perfect. The American Civil War has very big role in this movie. The war shows its brutal sides for example torture in a prisoner of war camp. Confederate soldiers' music is very sad to hear. Angel Eyes's violence is very sadistic. Tuco shows his ugly side memorably. Sometimes he has some good sides too. Blondie isn't hero or antihero.
This kind of masterpieces isn't done very often. 10/10",

272,26 April 2022,guskeller,10, One of the best films ever,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is iconic. Its plot of bandits searching for treasure is seemingly simple, but deconstructs many ideals. The film examines notions of heroes, violence, war, and greed by presenting honest complexities. Protagonists are cruel, immorality is explained through backstories, violence is brutal, and war tragically destroys everything in its path. Thus, the self-interested characters are understandable reflections of their decaying world. Eastwood isn't deep, but Wallach counterbalances that with shifty desperation. Ultimately, this movie challenges viewers to reconsider romanticized ideals of action heroes who glorify violence in morally simplistic stories.",

It is one of the best western films of all time, in my opinion the best. After this film, Clint Eastwood began to be recognized as an International film star. The film opens with a very familiar theme song composed by Ennio Morricone. I have heard this soundtrack a lot of times in other films, commercials and games. This instrumental soundtrack is one of the most iconic scores in the film history. When this theme song is combined with the presence of Clint Eastwood, as Blondie, it is even more meaningful. After the two films of the trilogy, I became familiar with Sergio Leone and his directing style. He uses extreme facial close-ups to express the feelings of a person without using conversations. He also uses long shots for the same purpose. Just by looking at the face of the actor from up close, you get to understand how he feels. In his films you get to see a lot of silent but expressive scenes. Take the last scene in the cemetery as an example. Before shooting starts, camera moves from one face to another, from one pistol to another. This scene starts with full long body shots and ends with extreme close ups to the eyes. This takes more than 4 minutes, and creates one of the most iconic scene of the film.",

The 'Once upon a time ...' movies would see Leone's films take on a much darker turn but although there is quite a lot of violence and death on display here, this is an almost jovial epic, (the humour comes from Leone's subversion of traditional western clich√©s).

These three are caught up in the hunt of the treasure worth 200 thousand dollars and what you get as an audience is the treasure of dialogs, acting, action, storytelling, music, back ground score, screenplay, camera work, immersing western atmosphere and in summary an extraordinary entertainer which relies on it wits just not its charm. Directed by western specialist Sergio Leone, the movie is funny, witty, clever, stylish and unforgettable from start to end. There are numerous scenes and conversations which you would like to revisit again and again. Ellie Wallach gives you a delicious portrayal of cunning and clever Tuco who befriends good guy Blondie in the hope of reaching to the treasure. Lee Van Cleef as bad guy gets less scenes and action but all are done with lots of style. All in all, coming from the old school of western thriller, this one is ageless entertainment.

This is just a great movie. It is the best western. Sergio Leone is a great director. He can make a scene really suspenseful and engaging with just silence and closes ups on the actors faces. He can make a characters face tell a story. The score by Ennio Morricone can elevate those scenes and moments to another level. His music and score is iconic and memorable. Leone and Morricone are fantastic and shouldn't be overlooked. The pacing is great. It doesn't slow down to much in this almost three hour film. Nothing dragged or felt out of place. The main trio of actors are amazing. Clint Eastwood as Blondie or The Man with No Name and his co star's Eli Wallach as Tuco and Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes respectful. Each actor was very unique in there roles. Wallach is a huge stand out. He plays this very dirty and ugly character with such energy and fun. Cleef is the perfect casting as the main antagonist. Eastwood is a stoic wanderer, he plays his character with a cool calm collective manner whilst being a smart badass gunslinger. The dialogue is great with many memorable lines. The characters are memorable and unique. The cinematography is very solid. The way some shots are framed is very creative. And the final is easily the most memorable and iconic western imagery in the western genres and film in general. The music elevates this moment so much. It's gripping and intense and will leave you satisfied. A great film everyone should watch!",

302,18 April 2020,DemonKiki,8, Nostalgic moment,"The beginning of the film is the vast desert. The three cowboys are silent and close to each other. The lens is pulled very close, and it is basically a close-up of the face. This distance is uncomfortable and produces a sense of depression. There are no lines here, only background sounds, rendering a strong tension, a precursor to the war. A large number of close-up close-ups are one of the features of this film. The director intends to highlight the character's character through body language and expression close-ups. From the beginning to 10:37 seconds, there is no line at all, I thought it was a color silent film. This shooting technique that only uses music, body language and expression is full of ritual and a little stage drama feeling (here I am also picking up teeth). ""The ugly"", ""the bad"" and ""the good"" characters appeared on the side with subtitles. This is also very classic in the history of movies. There are no lines in early movies. When the characters and plots are not rich enough , The director needs to add subtitles in the post-editing to illustrate the character identity and enrich the character image; when he was a child, he often saw it in the martial arts movies that watched the Shaw Brothers movie. In this audio film, we already know the characters (the director used a large amount of ink to describe the three people). Why should we use subtitles to show their identity? This way of emphasizing precisely expresses the sense of ritual. It can be said that in this rough ore-like western film, there is a hint of literary art.",

Blondie (Clint Eastwood), Tuco (Eli Wallach) and Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) are three men who are in search of gold coins that are buried in a cemetery. However, each man only knows a certain amount of information as to where the gold is and are therefore dependent on each other.",

And I can tell you now-Tarantino wasn't wrong! A Fistful Of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More are excellent films in their own right, but The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is more than just an excellent film-it is a major artistic achievement. The reasons for this permeate every aspect of the film.",

The quintessential Trio of film including Eastwood's The Good, Lee Van Cleef's The Bad, and Eli Wallace's The Ugly make the film incredibly entertaining, tense, and Thrilling. The post world war 2 backdrop where people were still fighting even though the war had ended adds a very interesting component to the film. Two specific scenes are perfect, peak cinema, masterpieces. Those two scenes are the Tuco Graveyard scene and the famous stand-off scene. These scenes hit incredibly hard and give me chills every time. One last thing to bring up is the beautiful score by Ennio Morricone, the theme The Ecstasy of Gold is one of the greatest pieces of classical music ever.

The spaghetti western trilogy not only launched a modern icon, Clint Eastwood, into stardom but by doing so ushered in a whole new era of film making. Even with the dubbed dialog and dated effects, it manages to remain a favorite of so many fans. That defines classic. I remember when I first saw this film. I wanted to be the man with no name. I wanted to wear the cape, wear the hat and ride the horse. It has stuck in mind for over 40 yrs. Now legendary composer Ennio Morricone demonstrated why he became what he is today. The international theme has been used countless times in countless forms of art. The film has staying power. It's classic good verses evil. Themes of greed, lust, power all reflect the human condition. And it is every bit as relevant today as it was set during the civil war times the movie is set in.

I've seen a lot of western movies in my life, and I enjoyed the majority of them. But, none of them have ever come close to matching this one. Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects and a perfect soundtrack. The story at first glance just sounds like your typical hunt for gold. But, I assure you that it's presented in such a very fresh and unique way. One thing to point out, most western films usually have a duel scene at some point during the movie. This film has a three-way duel at the end, you're probably wondering: ""how does that work?"" Well, that's all I'm going to say about that. You'll have to watch the movie and see for yourself! The acting is nothing short of sublime from the whole cast. Clint Eastwood puts on a flawless performance as Blondie. Eli Wallach is fantastic as Tuco, the friend/enemy of Blondie. Lee Van Cleef is exceptional as Angel Eyes, the main villain. As for the rest of the cast, they are just as exceptional. The sets/locations are spectacular and give this movie a great atmosphere. All of the special effects are very well-done, and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Ennio Morricone is phenomenal. It is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of my top 10 all-time favorite film scores. My personal favorite parts of the soundtrack are: ""The Ecstasy of Gold"", ""The Trio"" and the main theme song is one of my top 10 favorite opening theme songs in any movie. The film score sets the tone right from beginning to end. That's one way you can tell that you have a phenomenal soundtrack, when you play it at any random point in the song itself and recognize what movie, or show, it's from. The soundtrack for this movie is nothing short of memorable and iconic, kudos to you, Ennio Morricone! ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is a cinematic masterpiece. Another thing, it's just shy of three hours long. But, I can promise you, the three hours go by in a flash. It doesn't even feel like three hours, yet it is. What more can I say? I could watch this film 1,000 times in a row and never get bored with it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars.

360,24 January 2021,nikolacringeking,10," infinite/10, Please watch it","I've chosen to review a very amazing movie whose directors, players and music artists are pure legends, I am talking about the Sergio Leone, Eli Wallach, Lee Van Clef, Clint Eastwood and Ennio Morricone and the movie ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (Italian: Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo, lit. '""The good, the ugly, the bad""').
First, I would like to stress out the movie setting and its history. In the 1960's Western movies were becoming very popular, the Hollywood Westerns included heroes that were often well groomed, had nice clothing, had charismatic voices and shiny new guns, often times very good gunslingers that fought the bad guys and always won. The Spaghetti Western on the other hand was usually a low budget movie recorded in Italy, most often in Sicily, hence the name. Spaghetti Westerns were usually very violent and included not heroes but anti-heroes who usually worked for their own personal gain, this made the movies appear way more realistic. It is also noteworthy to say that that the music in the Hollywood Westerns was much simpler, chilling and relaxing, the music of the Spaghetti Westerns was almost always really energetic, took a lot of effort and increased in tone and frequency as the time went by. The last thing I would like to add is that we often think that the US Civil war was an entirely moral war, with the North being the good guys and the south the bad ones but even though most Hollywood Westerns' timeline happened in 1860's, the US Civil War was almost entirely ignored, this is contrasted by the Spaghetti Westerns who saw the neither side as good, they would show that both sides were bleeding each other dry and both sides committed atrocities, denying the enemy basic human rights. In this movie we find 3 main characters, the ""Good"", we do not know his name but he is often called ""Blondie"" by the ""Ugly"" who's known as ""Tuco"". The third character, ""The Bad"" is known by his alias ""Angel Eyes"". All of these 3 characters are excellent gunslingers and have 1 goal in life; personal gain. All the characters interact with each other in the movie, sometimes working together and sometimes trying to kill each other, often times by outwitting instead of using blunt force. The characters in the movie often don't use too much dialogue, but say more by saying less thus stressing out the important part. Lastly, I would like to talk about this movie's scenography and music. The music was mostly composed by 1 man; Ennio Morricone. The music rarely overlaps with the dialogue, which leaves the viewer to listen to what the characters say better. The director and the music artist had a talent of working together, there are scenes in the movie where the music is used primarily to build up tension and to incite action, for this reason the music is only used when the characters are or are acting silent for example: when characters are sneaking or are under threat.
Overall, the movie is widely recognised as a masterpiece and I agree, every single moment is either deeply embedded to the storyline or is action based, one can start watching this movie from any timeline and still find it interesting. For all these unique factors the movie offers I can do nothing but recommend it for everyone to watch.",

363,17 July 2002,Ghenghy,6," The funniest, but not the best","C'mon people, time for a little objectivity here. OK, I understand the deconstructionists love this movie for obvious reasons, but to call this the ""best western ever""??? Hell, it ain't even in Clint's top three! OK we have three great characters, great cinematography, a unique, quirky, and sometimes powerful score, the first ten minutes, and the last ten minutes of the movie that are all dynamite...but then there's all that crap in between! Apparently, after 'A Few Dollars More' somebody convinced Leone he was a great maker of CINEMA(rhymes with enema) and so he set out to create this interesting but overlong sojourn to a Civil War ravaged New Mexico where bandits roamed freely between the Union and Confederate armies. Nice premise but everything drags and drags and drags-JEEZ! Each scene develops on an excruciating timeline and if you view this as a serious Western you'll be asleep 30 minutes into it...that's always the effect it had on me-even when I was 16 on it's release. But if you plant your tongue in cheek and forget about the artistic grandeur of it all then you might enjoy this thing. For example-let's dissect the famous ""bridge"" scene. (spoiler alert) So we got a drunken Union commander leading the charge (and he even looks a little like Grant but he never led any charges except to the bar at the Appomattox Holiday Inn) back and forth, to and fro...cannon fire.. boom boom...drag the dead back...yawn! Now Blondie and Tuco got to get to the other side of the river, but there's this battle raging on and on and on over this bridge so it's logical that our heroes have to blow up the bridge right? We don't know WHY but we want to see Clint blow the hell out of something don't we?? Me, I would have forded the river, which appears to be about waist deep, somewhere downstream of all the fighting but that wouldn't suit our purpose here. I fall out of my chair everytime I see our boys knock that poor wounded yankee off his stretcher so the can load it up with dynamite to haul it down to the river. So the boys wait for an intermission in the battle, wire the bridge while no one on either side is looking, blow said bridge, jump behind the sandbags for cover but one of our heroes-Tuco, has his butt stuck up in the air just waiting for one of the Rebels to shoot it off. More cannon fire..boom boom...now EVERYBODY is dead, except of course our two boys who miraculously survived. Even Tuco's ass survived all the shelling which took out everybody and everything in sight! Now with everyone dead it's safe to walk across the river to get the gold. Oh, did I forget to mention that? Yeah, they're after $200,000 in gold and there's another character in hot pursuit but I'm getting to that. First Clint/Blondie finds a cannon that hasn't been fired yet pointing in the opposite direction of the battle which suits him just fine cause it's aimed towards Tuco who is racing off to find the gold. Now Clint is so cool he never even so much as flinches when he lights the fuse with his cheroot...without a doubt the coolest scene in the film. The three finally converge at the location of the gold, there's some witty repartee' between our hero/villains, and then we all square off for a three way gunfight. Tuco, Blondie, and Angel Eyes.......eyes, guns, fingers, eyes, teeth, guns, twitching fingers, more eyes, jeez get on with it! I'm sorry people but this is not a serious western and I laugh my ass off everytime I see it. Not only is this not the ""greatest"" of all time, hell it ain't even in the top 25 IMHO. I will give the director his due for a number of innovations that have been roundly lauded here, hell I even thought the Confederate Pep Band at the prison camp was a cute idea-silly as it was. They really needed a tuba though and the woodwind section was sorely in need of beefing up, but other than that? This thing is at least an hour too long but as a satire of the western genre I can live with it. I can't however live with this ""best ever"" tag which is an insult to the genre and to the myth, which is a myth to begin with. 6/10 but only for making me laugh.",

370,2 July 2007,reservoirclerk,10, A true epic and one of the greatest films of all time.,"I saw this movie for the first time on my tiny 15 inch screen of my TV/DVD player, and even on this minuscule format I was still simply amazed by the sheer scope of it. Now I understand and acknowledge the usual complaints against the film, namely the fact that the movie is almost three hours long with many scenes that tend to drag on for minutes with little dialog or action, however it is these scenes that make the movie the masterpiece that it is. Every shot whether it be an expansive landscape or an extreme close-up Sergio Leone draws you into his own version of the old west. A world where three men chase each other across the desert in search of 100,000 dollars worth of Confederate gold. Along the way they encounter Yankee and Confederate soldiers, Mexican bandits, bounty hunters in a journey that culminates in one of the most riveting showdowns in cinema history. What I found most interesting about this film however was the influence it obviously had on modern filmmaker Quentin Tarentino. Many of his trademarks (very memorable characters, long shots centered on a single character, intense standoffs involving multiple characters) can be found in abundance in this film as well. In fact Tarentino's Kun Fu epic Kill Bill goes so far as to barrow multiple songs from Leone's Dollars Trilogy. In the end all this adds up to make The Good the Bad and the Ugly in my opinion one of the greatest films of all time.",

'the good' has more humor, action and plot twists in it, but less scenes that make me shiver (except from the final shootout, which tremendously builds suspense). This is surely a 'must'.",

Though dubbed ""the Good,"" Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster.

If you haven`t seen this film I strongly recommand this film because it`s by far the most ambitious, unflinchingly graphic and stylistically influential western ever mounted. The film is an engrossing actioner shot through with a volatile mix of myth and realism. Clint Eastwood returns as the invincible ""Man with No Name,"" this time teaming with two gunslingers (Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef) to pursue a cache of $200,000 and letting no one, not even warring factions in a civil war, stand in their way. From sun-drenched panoramas to bold, hard closeups, exceptional camera work captures the beauty and cruelty of the barren landscape and the hardened characters who stride unwaveringly through it. Forging a vibrant and yet detached style of action that had not been seen before, and has never been matched since, ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" shatters the western mold in true Clint Eastwood style. Now with the plot being said all I have yet to say is that Clint Eastwood surpasses John Wayne in each film.

There is a back and forth relationship between the characters and a, literally, long journey for all of them, specifically the 'Good' and the 'Ugly' characters. The action scenes are well executed and fairly exciting. Some of the cinematography and editing is top notch, the end scene specifically comes to mind. The score by Ennio Morricone is legendary and adds suspense and intrigue to a film that could otherwise suffer from slow pacing. Where the film falls a bit flat for me is the depth of the characters. The three title characters are actually not all that different, even though the title would suggest otherwise. While these characters do differ in style and personality, which does create some contrasts, their convictions and morals are quite clich√© (although maybe less so in the year the film was made) as they all want one thing and they are all willing to commit the same deeds to get there. Due to the lack of depth and sympathy in these characters this created a scenario where I did not really care what happened to any of them, or who won out in the eventual end to the tale. Having said this, the characters do very much compliment each other with the few subtle differences they have, specifically in personality; they all have their own unique charm, while sustaining a ruthlessness that is needed to succeed in the wild West...",

There are several reasons for this. For one thing, it has never really dated at all in all these years. The immorality of its central three characters is a factor of course. The black and white moral certainties of the traditional American western are nowhere to be found here. One of the reasons for this is the film's Italian origins. The movies of Italy had no qualms with projecting morally ambiguous heroes onto the screen. Nor did they see any issue with and filling their stories with plenty of violence. Add to this, the Italian tradition of operatic drama and you have the basic ingredients of the spaghetti western. The immorality, cynicism, violence and operatic sense of drama were the template where this most American of genres was filtered through, the result was a somewhat distinctive sub-genre.",

It shows you the three guys that have found themselves in war between blue guys and grey guys and how they proceed in their missions. After a short period of time you start to feel like movie just wraps everything around and like everything is connected and then it just shows you that they cross their paths multiple times. Then scene where Blondie is pushed over the limit by The Ugly you are in shock as you can't believe it's happening but then it all just shifts around and suddenly one need the other to find all the buried money and then they are going on a mission in finding the gold. Suddenly you realize it's going to be bad as they get to the graveyard and it's absolutely huge. Then in all motion and looking for grave The Bad comes to the door and gets them to listen him after finding gold isn't there he is forced to take a challenge by The Good and it was so tense that you just start feeling anxious and just break little by little. Shootout is happening and you are stunned just in the moment you realize what happened and everything is getting to it's place. The end is coming and just once again just don't believe The Good is going to leave The Ugly hanging there, then he comes out and shots the rope and leaves leaving you just amazed. Movie was so intelligently written and characters are also very smart, building tension was huge in couple of scenes and it just gets you to the edge and also all connections and deception creates a perfect movie. 4/4",

Everything about it is perfect, Acting, Filming, not to mention the genius director Sergio Leone.

I had heard The Good, The Bad, And the Ugly was he best, but i had no idea how they could top the first 2 off. Trust me, they did. This film is darker than the first two, and also very funny. for Example when Blondie rescues Tuco from getting hung the second time and leaves him the desert for no reason what-so-ever. Than when Tuco finds a Town and goes to the gun shop, and the funniest part is when he is target practicing and shoots the first two in the head and shots em off.

Eastwood plays his part with excellence as do the other two actors. Especially Eli Wallach is perfect in his role of Tuco. The music of Ennio Morricone is also the best!

Sure, there's a lot that can be said about what's not right about it like the much debated behind the camera scenes not getting noticed till the characters are supposed to and about a dozen other things, but I think that's unimportant compared to what IS right about it. As someone else already mentioned, the last 20 minutes or so, from when Tuco does his running to the shoot-out climax is like an emotion. It's Opera, it's every comic book, every great song, every fairytale, it's what every movie is supposed to do, it's well....everything. Call me a woos but it can still almost make me cry every time I see it, it's that beautiful.

However, it is visually and audibly superior to most other films, even though it is short on content. Satire is a difficult thing to do in film; and doing it in a Western is seldom done well. Offhand, only Blazing Saddles and this film (or all spaghetti Westerns) make that distinction. Only young teens would believe any of these characters could exist in real life, and there is nothing wrong with fantasy in film. However, most adults will be laughing in spots where teens would most likely be enthralled. The film is a lot like an episode of Seinfeld (a story about nothing).

They're all one-dimensional with some simple character traits but the acting was very good, especially Eli Wallach's performance. Another gripe I have with this movie is the sound editing.

474,14 September 2020,Diegbl,10, Seems Just Like Old Times,"Clint Eastwood. Lee Van Cleef. Eli Wallach. Sad Hill Cemetery. Hidden Gold. With these five elements, Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone build what for many of us is the best ending in Seventh Art history. But before talking about the ending, it is essential that we review the events that have led us to such a situation and, what is even more important, the characters who, in one way or another, are predestined to face each other. On the one hand, we have Tuco, played by Eli Wallach, who is probably the character that viewers will most easily sympathize with. His motivation is simple: making money, and he has no problem about crawling on the floor or being humiliated to get it. Sergio Leone is in charge of constantly emphasizing these personal traits, summarized in the following sentence: where we were born, in order not to die of hunger, we had to choose, be a priest or a bandit. Next to him, we have Blondie, played by Clint Eastwood. No one doubts that his main motivation is to earn money, but it is undeniable that he is a character with greater pride, it means that he is not willing to take the money if he must kneel for it. He is a cold, calculating and intelligent character, and those adjectives are also useful when talking about Sentenza, played by Lee Van Cleef, who is not much different from Rubio, but with an even more evil and perverse background. The construction of characters throughout the film is simply wonderful, the picture shows us different scenes and situations in which we can draw conclusions about the behavior of each of the protagonists. The photography follows a very similar style to that of Leone's other films, with its characteristic zooms to the faces of the characters, which somehow help us to understand the emotions they express even more easily. Leone is also capable of managing the narrative tempo and tightening the dramatic chord in certain scenes, without forgetting that we are watching a Spaghetti Western and that, by definition, it should be entertaining for the viewer. The soundtrack should not even be commented, because Ennio Morricone once again creates one of those soundtracks that remain in the public's head for centuries, being part of popular culture and representing an entire cinematographic genre such as the Spaghetti Western. However, and although it is undeniable that the first two hours and twenty minutes of the film are of impressive quality, it is the last twenty minutes that make it one of the greatest classics in Seventh Art history. The ending is so good that we don't have to talk deeply about technical topics to understand and analyze its greatness, I think it seems unfair to have to talk about photography, editing, performances, music, etc. when talking about this ending. And the thing is, I truly believe that the magic of the ending is that, unlike in many other so charged with drama endings, the characters end up behaving as planned, just as the script has shown us throughout the film, being faithful to the script and, consequently, to the viewers. In that instant, you realized that The Good behaves as good fellows do, The Bad ends as bad guys end, and The Ugly ends up depending on the honor of good men. It is at that moment that Clint Eastwood looks at Eli Wallach and says: it seems just like old times. It is at that moment that you understand that everything fits, and then the music, photography and editing merge into a same element, and each character ends as the title of the picture suggests: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.",

It's enjoyable landscapes, scenes, costuming, and gunfights do make it a timeless western. Clint Eastwood's performance is stellar like always. He alone makes the movie worth watching.

Eli Wallach gives one of the greatest supporting performances ever in a movie; in truth, he's really the star of this film. The direction is top notch with a gritty, funny and tender script. It is also a tribute to a different school of film-making, that which used the dubbing technique. The audio is a separate entity by itself, enabled to its height by Ennio Morricone's legendary soundtrack. I sometimes run the movie just to listen to it. There is a lot to talk about when discussing this film. Clint's hero seems to emerge at the same time in the 60's that John Wayne's hero seems a little out of touch - coincidence? I think not.

The ""dollar trilogy"" (1964 - 1966) of which ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is the last one and The ""Once upon a time trilogy"" (1968 - 1984) of which ""Once upon a time in the West"" was the first one.",
489,17 December 2016,TheOneThatYouWanted,10, Possibly the greatest movie ever made,"I can see why this is considered one of the greatest films ever made. The film is about three very different men in the old West looking for a two thousand dollar treasure. The acting is a tour de force, especially coming from the actor playing The Ugly. The soundtrack is famously outstanding. The gun play and action is so real and visceral. The build up works with the tension and a million other things to bring the story to life. This is practically a three hour movie but it seems like just an hour because you're having a great time watching; and you are so invested in the characters and plot. I can not say enough about this film, it is brilliant.",
490,3 April 2020,karladavisio,10, Good movie,"The film directed by Sergio Leone occupies the top places in the lists of ""Best Films of All Time"", and Quentin Tarantino considers it the standard of direction. But in 1966, when the picture was released, it was perceived very ambiguously.
Good (an unnamed shooter nicknamed ""Blonde"" - Clint Eastwood), ""Bad"" (Sentenz's killer nicknamed ""Angel Eyes"" - Lee Van Cleef) and ""Angry"" (a scammer Tuko - Illai Wallak) continue to crank up their machinations to help they get hold of large amounts of cash.
While Sentenza is looking for Confederate gold worth $ 200 thousand, the Blonde releases Tuko, whom the bounty hunters wanted to hand over to the authorities for a fee, and he himself hands it over to justice.
But at the time of execution the Blonde shoots the rope on which Tuko was supposed to hang, saves him, and the money received for his head is divided equally. With this number, they go around several other cities. At some point, all the lines of the heroes intersect ...
Leone set himself the task of showing the absurdity of the war and the complete absence of any good motives in them.
The budget of the last film of the trilogy was significantly larger than the first two parts. And Clint Eastwood received for his role not only a decent fee, but also a percentage of the fees.",

While it's made clear which characters are the good, the bad and the ugly, There's no real 'good' in the film: all of the three main characters have their 'good' side (except maybe the bad, who seems the only really cruel character). The first really good thing is the setting. With the civil war background, it gave quite realism to the whole story. The film could make feel the horror of thew civil war much better than 'gone with the wind' did, simply because it showed one single battle. Tuco's character is maybe the most interesting one. Ennio Morricone's music felt sometimes too peaceful respect the scenes it was meant for, but was still really good. The best thing about the good, the bad and the ugly is that despite it's 2h 40m long, and there's not too much action, it keeps you on. While I'm not really happy with extended violence, and this movie has plenty of violence and cruelty, I really enjoyed this film.

Clint Eastwood for the third time dons his trademark multicoloured poncho to mark his place in the international hall of fame, while Sergio Leone imprints himself as one of the greats of world cinema. After a poorly remade ""Yojimbo"" and a barely passable ""For a Few Dollars More"" Leone manages to take hold of all that worked in his previous movie (long focused eyeshots, Enrio Morricone's soundtrack, quirky but memorable one-liners, the Eastwood character) and molds it together with a very good plot, great cast, witty dialogue and a markedly improved budget. The end product is an absolute classic Western. Despite a wacked-up moral compass it permeates with a sense of profound humanity, which manages to entice in between the wit and humour of the main action. Running a mere 3 hours in the extended version time flies by unnoticed, which says a lot about how well and how entertaining this movie is.",

Even though the movie is pretty long and slow moving, it still keeps you engaged till the end with its many, unexpected twists and turns. The background music is brilliant and conveys the feel of an anarchic and violent climate. The actors fit their character roles perfectly, especially Eli Wallach as Tuco.

Watching the movie feels like listening to a long musical composition, watching it build and build into a heart pounding crescendo, at the same time basking in the scenes where time feels like it slows down so we could soak in the beauty that this ugly, fragile world has to offer.",
509,16 January 2006,jdoan-4,10, Not a wasted shot,"I haven't watched this film many times. Yet, I think I can safely say that there is not a wasted shot in the whole film. Leone is able to use each scene to perfection. He uses wide shots at the right time. He uses close-ups when he needs to. He puts in long shots for the perfect effect. This is such a well constructed movie. Many people might consider it sloppy and rough. I think it is amazing. There are many shots in which Leone isolates the characters. I don't remember many shots where more than one character are in the frame at the same time. When they are, there is almost always space between them. His characters are out for themselves, and for no one else. Their connection with other characters exist only in their desire and drive for gold. There are many shots in which a character stands surrounded by vast nothingness. Leone's characters are in control of their own wills, but they are not in control of their destinies. Consider the scene where Tuco is about to kill Blondie in the hotel. A canon hits the room before he can accomplish this. Blondie seems to be the only person who controls his fate, and he doesn't have ultimate control. The acting is superb. Eastwood doesn't little enough to give his character tremendous depth and mystery. He isn't merely stoic and squinting. He is a true character with many levels. Wallach is extreme and not other the top. It would be very easy for the character to be cartoonish. Yet Leone and Wallach are able to give him many different facets. Angel Eyes is truly evil. I like the hat that van Cleef wears. It makes his face seem very slim and his eyes very narrow, very snake-like. The music is good as well. This is a masterpiece.",

In this case you will not only enjoy spending quality time with this movie but visit the days of the Wild West from different points of view.

This movie does something I always look for i.e. memorable scenes which is the reason to ""comeback"" and view this movie several times in addition to wanting it for your personal collection. Its a sure thing for your viewing pleasure. The characters in this movie make us believe without effort that this is really happening and we can relate to it because it is so close to real human nature. Survival instincts, greed, vanity, betrayal, trust, and so many other human nature points are all acted out making us relate. I like to eat while watching a movie and there are some eating scenes that make you want to ""eat-a-long"". Highly recommend a stew type meal, bread and a tasty drink or Turkey legs for this movie.

I think (and many would probably disagree with this) that most, if not all of the Civil War scenes, tend to,make the film less flowing. Certainly they make it unnecessarily long. If Leone had chosen to not concentrate so much on creating a spectacle or epic, but focused on the key point of the movie (i.e the gold) I would have personally enjoyed it more. Heck, I would have given it a 7, or 8 even. All three leads do a good job, with Wallach providing the comic relief, and Eastwood most of its cool factor.

Most of them were done on the kinds of budgets that wouldn't even cover the catering costs of most big budget Hollywood extravaganzas of today. And, truth be told, most of them weren't very good, with badly dubbed voices, and sadistic violence. But Sergio Leone, though he loathed the term ""spaghetti western"", was different. In his famous ""Dollars"" trilogy, he not only became a director of international renown, but he also elevated his star Clint Eastwood from the Rowdy Yates years of ""Rawhide"" to immortality as The Man With No Name. The first two films of that trilogy were 1964's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and 1965's FOR A FEW DOLLARS more, both of which were released in America in 1967. The final, and best, film of that trilogy was the mercurial THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, made in 1966 and released here in America at the end of 1967.

Since 1967, color has practically covered all of the screens. Perhaps symptomatically, on my personal list of best films of the year only one was made in Technicolor. It was not the Leone spaghetti-western, it was Fred Zinnemann's Man for all seasons. TV was also b&w, and '66 was the year of the last of the 271 episodes in the fine series Perry Mason , started in '57.",

From what I remember of the last time I saw it, which was in French with English subs, I enjoyed it a hell of a lot more. One of the key parts of what made the film entertaining was the score. 99 times out of 100 it fitted the scene in question perfectly, and added to the feeling of the moment perfectly. The camera work was actually surprisingly good too, the use of cameras created tension and build up with out the use of massivley expensive special effects. The one particular scene which I feel sums up the film is the amazing showdown scene in the cemetry. The use of music, cameras and the brilliant acting of our three leads. The scene is awesome, it keeps your eyes stuck to the screen and makes you feel a part of what's taking place. Even if you've seen the picture before and know what's going to happen, you still think it could turn out differently... That is the brilliance of the film.",

When you go to a fine restaurant and spend half your paycheck on a piece of meat, you unconsciously force yourself into denial that that piece of meat is the best you've ever eaten. Even if you would have been more content with McDonald's. Why? Because you just spent half your paycheck on it, and some French guy somewhere says it's fine meat, thus you have to agree. You HAVE to. You're unwilling to admit your disappointment. You tell yourself that your taste buds just aren't evolved enough, even though that is just stupid. It works the same way with movies. Once you've seen 500 pages of perfect reviews, read that the film received 100% rating from professional critics, admitting to yourself that you weren't content with the film isn't easy. It's even harder to admit it to other people. It's nearly impossible to write a review stating it. This opening paragraph can apply to thousands of movies. But this is how I felt about The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. It wasn't bad, but it lacked the full contentment I expected.",

People Cannot call themselves 'Movie buffs' until they have watched 'The good the bad and the ugly'. Clint Eastwood plays his role as 'The man with no name' Elegantly, keeping the mysterious tone the character had in the previous films whilst still showing different emotions as the movie progresses, this is one of Clint Eastwoods' finest roles. Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach also played their roles tremendously with each of them displaying their characters emotions and motives clearly and beautifly. The movie has some of the most suspenseful and engaging action sequences in movie history and I was left at the edge of my seat at the end of most of them, as for the final showdown; let's just say it's one of the greatest scenes in Cinema history. The movie also has a brilliantly written script and some of the finest cinematography ever, this makes the already engaging and action packed story even better. The good The bad and The ugly ticks all the boxes when it comes to doing things right, directors from today need to remember how geniuses like Sergio Leone crafted pieces of art like the good the bad and the ugly, with an fantastic story, brilliant actors, incredible script, suspenseful action scenes, beautiful cinematography and one of the finest soundtrack of all time, not only is 'the good the bad and the ugly' the greatest western of all time...

561,27 August 2021,Cartoonyloonie,10, It is THE western film from some time ago,"The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly directed by Sergio Leone is often regarded as one of the best films ever made, well a lot of films that serve a great inspiration to movies of the same genre past it, are often labeled under that category. However, whether you have seen this picture or not, you have most likely heard its theme song in the past, even if you are not necessarily into movies. The main narrative, revolves around three men, on the search for Bill Carson $200,000 worth of gold buried in Sad Hill Cemetery with each one, wanting all of the prize to themselves, or so it seems. Before the release of this film, Sergio was known for his work on silence motion pictures, which explains the lack of dullness and exposition present in this movie. Instead Sergio is more known as a director that prefers situation over story lines, the characters find out about their problems around the same time, that the audiences do which makes it feel like you are also part of the situation. The cinematography of this picture, also compliments this point, as what ever is not included in the frame of the shot, not only can't the audiences see it, but the characters within the frame will not be able to see anyone that lays outside it. This is a great technique to subvert the audiences expectations of the given moment, when the viewers see a character surrounded by an obstacle that just so happens to seem unescapable, they may never know for sure, if the character time is up until its really over for them, as their help could easily be a couple inches away from the frame of the camera. The same thing goes for when the characters appear to be in a favourable and safe position, the danger could just be a few feet away, which also subverts our expectations, as if the characters feel like they are in control, it will make the viewers go under a false sense of security, therefore if the danger does approach, it tricks both the audience and the people within the frame.",

Like Sergio's Once Upon a Time in the West, this film is drenched in memorable style (spaghetti Western art direction and that iconic Morricone score) but lacks genuine substance. I don't think there's a single thing this film does better than the two previous entries. If anything it doubles down on all the worst parts of the first two. This is the Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End of the ""Dollars Trilogy"" - tons of ambition, drenched in the style of the first two, but it never feels substantive or clicks like the earlier ones. The plot is a cat and mouse chase for Confederate gold with the Civil War in the backdrop.

It should be a world with it's own point of view.  It's own morality and rules.  It should then stick by those rules and force the audience to see the world through the eyes of it's director. Sergio Leone's ""The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly"" fits all of those qualifications as well as any movie I have ever seen.

There's the score by Ennio Morricone which has the spirit of the West all over it. There's the acting core of Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef. And there's Sergio. Out of all the Sergio Leone films that I've seen, this is the most complete (even more complete since I've seen the remastered DVD). It has a story that is more than revenge and has subtle humanistic and political messages (POW camp, references to Andersonville prison, the meaningless bridge war, the missionary hospital, the dying confederate soldier,etc). Of course the most refined was Fistful of Dynamite (a.k.a - Duck, You Sucker), but it didn't have Eastwood and has a different ""feel"" from the first three. Also in that same light as Once Upon in America (also politically charged and Eastwood-less). It is safely the most refined of the Eastwood-Leone trilogy. It has a protagonist that is not the classical hero type. He is more of an anti-hero. You have the villain that is ruthless beyond measure and in between there's the dangerous comic relief brute. This is a must see film for anyone that likes movies. The best scene is the duel scene at the end with all 3 of our protagonists dueling each other in a Mexican standoff/chess game.",
572,21 January 2015,disinterested_spectator,10, An Amoral Treasure Hunt,"Prior to the release of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" whenever a bunch of people in a movie embarked on a project to obtain a great deal of money, something always went wrong. In some cases, the project was illegal, and given the Production Code in force at the time, the criminals had to die or be arrested, as in ""The Killing"" (1956). In ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" (1963), the treasure hunters are not criminals, but the buried treasure was stolen loot, so they all had to be arrested in the end. But even when the enterprise was entirely legal, there was an unwritten rule that it must fail, that pursuing money per se was wrong in some way and must not be rewarded. For example, in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1948), there was nothing illegal about the three men prospecting for gold, but it had to fail nevertheless. When the two surviving members of the team realize that all their gold has been lost, they laugh about it. Presumably, even when the search for money was legal, it had to fail, as a way of making those in the audience content with their lot. One slight exception is ""King Solomon's Mines"" (1950 et al.). They do manage to keep a handful of gems, but the vast treasure is lost for good.",

What keeps us coming back to this movie time and time again is the wry humor and the MUSIC!! Along with Jaws, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly elevates itself to the level of the greatest motion picture score of all time. It has become a clich√© now when the opening whistle melody embodies the Western shootout in movies, TV, commercials, you name it. Keep in mind, before this, the western ideal for music was always the large orchestral scores with sweeping melodies ala Copland, Korngold, Moross, Elmer Bernstein, etc. Ennio Morricone used electric guitars, whistling and hyena howls!!

The scenery especially is strong in this movie, with a lot of travel through gorgeous midwest/western settings, and only a few scenes in towns. The setting of the movie during the civil war adds a lot of opportunities for war scenes, which are interspersed throughout the movie, and help create a constant atmosphere of tension and suspicious. The acting is great ,especially for the three main characters, and especially for Van Cleef. All three are compelling enough that I wasn't even sure who I wanted to win in the end.

You can almost feel you're there,trying to avoid bullets. This is Leone's final western from the trilogy, and clearly the best.Here, he showed all of his directorial techniques,the legendary close-ups,the 10-minutes-of-silence-and-tension scenes and similar. Ennio Morricone composed a truly remarkable soundtrack for this film,and,as a musician,I would say it perfectly fits in the whole story.Every character has its specific tune played with another instrument every time(Man With No Name-flute,Angel Eyes-organ,Tuco-human voice). Clint Eastwood shows us what we'll see from him in the future with his smooth talking, laconic speech, mean looks, and that ever persistent cigarillo in his mouth.Don't forget the legendary one-liners he is saying throughout the film such as- Man With No Name: You see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig. I laugh every time I see it. Lee Van Cleef gives his best performance here.His little,piercing eyes make him ideal for this role. Eli Wallach is also perfect as Tuco, the nosy bandit who never stops talking and has a key role in the film. Finally,I think everybody should see this film, simply because of its greatness,magnificence and cinematic significance.It defines the word ""cool""-and makes you wonder every time you see it.It holds 4th place on IMDb 250,it deserves it in every aspect,but for me,damn it,it's the best movie ever made.Seriously.",

GBU has amazing cinematography and acting and writing and directing. it is epic in its significance and plot. clint is at his best, with few words but subtle expressions that speak volumes. my favorite scenes are the interactions b/n duco and clint at the beginning, the civil war scene, and the scene where duco is running around the cemetary. sergio leone is amazing; however, i didn't think the other 2 ""man with no name"" titles were that spectacular. my 2nd favorite movie of his is once upon a time in america (the full-length version of course)",

The three-dimensionality of the characters in the film is unmatched. Fifty years before the MCU, Sergio Leone laid the foundation for epic action films that successfully amalgamate comedy in an organic way and feature antiheroes capable of connecting with the audience in a natural way, as we see him more frequently today in movies of James Gunn or Taika Waititi.",
601,29 August 2013,pat_mar,9, Perfect in every way,"The best western ever made period! In the last and the best installment of his so-called ""Dollars"" trilogy of Sergio Leone-directed ""spaghetti westerns,"" Clint Eastwood reposed the role of a taciturn, enigmatic loner. Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly (Eli Wallach), a Mexican bandit. Though dubbed ""the Good,"" Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster. The film's title reveals its ironic attitude toward the canonized heroes of the classical western. ""The real West was the world of violence, fear, and brutal instincts,"" claimed Leone. ""In pursuit of profit there is no such thing as good and evil, generosity or deviousness; everything depends on chance, and not the best wins but the luckiest."" Immensely entertaining and beautifully shot in Techniscope by Tonino Delli Colli, the movie is a virtually definitive ""spaghetti western,"" rivaled only by Leone's own Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).",
602,16 December 2014,sn319,8, Hypnotic and Entertaining,"While I believe Once Upon a Time in the West to be a better film overall, I still believe that The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is one of the finest westerns ever made. It's hypnotic directing and story, combined with the grittiness and operatic nature of the music compound to create an absolute treat. If that's not enough for you, the performances in the film are entrancing. Clint Eastwood as the Man With no Name is as good as it gets and Lee Van Cleef is as excellent here as he was in the previous film. Add in Tuco, a character who has some real memorable lines, and you have one heck of a movie.",

605,6 May 2007,Stu-42,8," The good, the really good and the not-so-good","If this were the only movie Leone made there wouldn't be enough praise you could lavish on it. It is amazing and fans of this genre will be thoroughly pleased. However, this is not only not Leone's best, but actually is his third best! Yes, I am aware Fistful of $ is a remake- doesn't matter, watch the movie, it's mesmerizing. You had the classic opening 10 minutes with no dialogue, the clever storyline where each character knows something the other doesn't and the climactic gunfight. One mustn't forget the wonderful Morricone score. There were some problems though that we might not want to face because we love Sergio and Clint, but let's face them just the same shall we? Brutal violence is a trademark of this genre, but here it was done over the line where it was unnecessarily vicious. It worked in Fistful because there was a sort of logic to it whereas here in scenes like the shot through the pillow and the abandoning of Tuco it came off as being just too cruel to justify. Slapping of women and leaving people to hang are tough elements, but ones that had a feel that they belonged. As for the gunfights, they were good of course, but you get the feeling that they could have been better or more convincing. Also, I must agree with those who say it's a trifle long and before you say ""Hey, you have to get the feel of the movie and you don't understand what Leone's trying to do"" remember I'm a huge fan and am merely saying that there wasn't quite enough here to fill out 3 hours worth of movie. To say this movie was awesome doesn't really do anyone any good because we all know that. What we don't seem to know judging by the fact that this is #4 on IMDb is that there are better movies out there that didn't have these kinds of problems. Leone took his concepts and gelled them into the masterpiece that followed called Once Upon a Time in the West. I dare you to watch that one and then still give GBU a 10. OUATITW does all the things exactly right that this movie almost got right and then some. Even Morricone's score gets better in that one if you can believe it.",

630,15 November 2001,Cherubin,10, you won¬¥t even notice that it¬¥s more than 3 hours long,"I saw ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" when I was still in my early teens and didn¬¥t like it much then. I thought it was like an action movie but without the comforting elements usually associated with action movies like moral clarity and extremely spectacular fight scenes. However, recently, I saw it again on video and liked it for this exact same reason and more. The movie begins with a credit sequence of gun shots, grainy photos from the movie, and great music by Ennio Morricone that already tells you to expect a trip that¬¥s exciting and fun. Then it rushes straight into a set of fight scenes which introduce the three main characters very dramatically (complete with titles to let you know which adjective in the title each character represents). Each of these characters is a morally flawed person who makes a living off of death. The ""Bad"" Angel Eyes makes his living as a soldier and a mercenary. The ""Good"" Blondie makes his living by making a travesty of hangings by always freeing the convicted men he turns in for reward money just before the rope should kill them. His ""goodness"" is only relative. The ""Ugly"" Tuco basically makes his living any way he can and his list of crimes is absurdly varied (ranging from all kinds of violence to statutory rape). He is a true opportunist without overriding morals but not entirely without a conscience. Played by Eli Wallach, Tuco actually steals the show from his 2 more famous costars because while they are almost superhuman in their skills, he is strikingly human in all his flaws. All three of these men, on individual terms, eventually come to know of a fortune buried in a graveyard and constantly keep fighting each other for knowledge of its exact location since each man only knows a different hint of where it is hidden and not the whole story. While such a plot does not seem too great, Sergio Leone choreographs every scene (violent or otherwise)to make it as suspenseful and expertly made as possible. The film also gets a lot of its entertainment value from Tarantinoishly holding nothing sacred. The three heroes scheme against other characters with a joyfully effortless malevolence, and  not even the American Civil War is held sacred as the men try to manipulate the ""senseless"" conflict full of hopelessly drunken soldiers to make their quest for the treasure easier. The result of all this is that although ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is more than 3 hours long, there is never a dull moment, making it seem about an hour or so shorter than it actually is. What¬¥s most important, though, is that it is a thinking person¬¥s action movie which unpretentiously demonstrates the absurdity of real life and helps us to laugh at it. If there is such a thing as a perfect western, this is the one. 10 stars out of 10 !",

In this movie he's a liar, a thief and is more interested in money; compare this to the first movie where he is more of a quiet hero who ends up giving his money away to a girl, her husband and son and leaves town with nothing more than he came in with (although the town is cleaned up) and the second where, although less of a benefactor, he helps take down a vicious madman.

TGBU is the final part of Sergio Leone's 'Dollar Trilogy' and if you've seen the previous two films, TGBU seems a lot more polished.

Allow me to surmise a bit of history: having created two of the greatest westerns ever with ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and ""For A Few Dollars More"", some unscrupulous soul was able to convince Sergio Leone that he was a creator of great cinema, instead of a creator of great westerns; this movie was the result. Gone are the brilliantly set-up action sequences, replaced with senseless and dull confrontations, with size, not even quantity, trying to make up for the lost quality. Gone are the witty and interesting characters and the deep character development, replaced with annoying, inconsistent, and flat caricatures. As to just what Leone was trying to say with this movie, for clearly he felt it had a message, it is either horribly unclear or completely and pathetically trite. In his quest to make a movie with meaning, Leone cast aside what had made this movie's ""predecessors"" so wonderful, and found that not only did he lose the bird in his hand, but he couldn't catch the ones in the bush and fell in a pile of excrement in trying.",

What amazes me about this movie is that it doesn't feel like it's made in 1966 to me. The shootings are so timeless. Settings are great. There are many iconic scenes. And I must say Ennio Mocorelli made the soundtrack so perfect that I still listen to some of those iconic songs today.,

I am a huge fan of Italian Horror films and leone is making me a fan of the spaghetti westerns. My father was always a huge fan of the dollars trilogy and had many times told me that the good the bad and ugly was the best. Perhaps the best thing about this film is the many ways it has influenced the film makers of today. I think many of my favorite films would not be the same at all with out a leone influence and his great films raising the bar.,

Boasts an unforgettable Morricone score, a typically charismatic performance from Clint Eastwood and stately direction from the master of the genre, Sergio Leone With A Fistful of Dollars (1964), Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone gave birth to the spaghetti western. So it is appropriate that he should take the helm for the quintessential example of the genre with this, the best and last of the Dollars trilogy (after 1965's For A Few Dollars More).",

It took an Italian director to get the Old West right, at least on screen, dumping the hokey musical scores and make believe good guy/bad guy cowboys and indians hokum that killed a lot of Hollywood westerns, while retaining the epic scope that the vast landscapes evoke (even if it was really Spain). This 3rd movie centering on the Man with No Name (not exactly true, but its catchy) was the 1st that Leone got the inimitable Ennio Morricone to score from the outset, and that score has such an impact there's no doubt it has a lot to do with TGTBTU's attraction through almost 40 years. It really sticks with you! This Ultimate Spaghetti Western was also elevated by a bigger budget and much stronger screen presence of its principal characters. Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef are true screen legends, competing any which way they can for the stolen bags of gold, culminating in the most famous gunfight in moviedom.",

I don't want to give away the story, but as you watch it you'll will find the story very easy to understand indeed. the director Sergio Leone in my opinion has to go down as one of the finest directors in the history especially the 1960s era.",

I mean, the amount of charisma of the main trio is immeasurable, loved it! Loved the characters, loved the setup, loved the atmosphere, and especially the score - Morricone is a genius, but that's a well-known fact. So why not a full rating? The events with the civil war were kinda slow and it just decelerated the movie a lot. The tempo was broken off and it did concern me a bit. Yeah, we got some of the important information in this phase of the movie, but yeah, it is a flaw. I love this movie anyway, I think it's better than Once Upon a Time in the West and I was in love with the zooms and stuff - it's obvious that Tarantino was inspired by spaghetti western in Django Unchained - one of my favs of all time. So yeah, it is definitely that good and I'm sure that I'll watch more westerns in the future because this genre has a lot to offer. So yeah, watch it if you don't and remember - this is the cinema.",

When interviewed by the Beeb in 1989, film scholar and Leone expert Christopher Frayling remarked that Leone wanted to deploy a sense of 'flamboyant rhetoric' which went beyond the traditional US western oater style. Clint Eastwood's performance as a taciturn supercool gunslinger has great flair. Memorable scenes include Wallach's shooting of a baddie while he is in a a bath - 'If you're gonna shoot - shoot!'; the poignant prisoner-of-war scenes with the choir comprised of wretched Confederate soldiers which conjure visions of violence and brutality and the equally moving scene when Eastwood shows compassion to a dying young soldier by offering him a puff of a cigarillo.

But this film was different. The acting was awsome, and the thing I enjoy the most about western films is all that you can see a lot when you are looking at the actors faces. For example when Tuco is following Blondie's trail, he finds multiple, dead cigars untill he finds one that still have fire in it, and at that moment you can see the joy on his face because he knows hes close. And this is truly amazing! That last duel in the end is the best cowboy duel the world ever saw. Its a amazing sequence of face and body language acting. Just the moment Angeleye try to go for his gun and Blondie gives him that one look and he moves his hand away. Just this one small moment shows how got the performance and the script was. Talking about this movie without talking about Ennio Morricone's music would be a sin. This is probably has perfect has a movie soundtrack can get. We could spend hours talking about just the music.

It is unlikely that will ever to gather team of artists to shoot something! This film can be the younger film makers serve as an example on how the film should be.

700,25 December 2006,Ismaninb,10, Philosophy and art,"With more than 40 pages of reviews, what can I add? Let me focus on a few sides I haven't read about. The first one is philosophy. Movies, which aspire to be philosophical usually are boring and pompous. Probably Leone did not have such ambitions. Still philosophy - together with myth and religion, as pointed out by others - plays an important role. Since the antique times of the Greeks and Romans philosophers ask themselves the question: how can one lead a virtuous life in difficult circumstances? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is Leone's answer. There is no doubt about the Bad (Lee van Cleef). His name Angel Eyes must refer to the Fallen Angel, as he represents Evil. I don't know Italian, but I would not be surprised if the correct translation of Il Brutto should have been the Hypocrite. Tuco's (Eli Wallach) ways are ugly, only doing good when it is in his own interest. But what about the Good (Clint Eastwood)? His name, Blondie, refers to medieval characters like the Lady in the Tower with the Golden Hair, or Siegfried from the Nibelungen saga. Blondie certainly does not represent good the way all religions would like to see it. He is cynical, mean, ruthless, violent. He only shows compassion when he can afford it. I think the final scene of the movie gives the answer: in a lawless world being virtuous means being in a position of power and then apply a rudimentary kind of justice. Can anyone assume, that Tuco will have nice memories of Blondie? We can turn this argument around. If Blondie is good, what kind of world is he living in? I guess, we all must be grateful to live in an orderly society and not in a free for all.",

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. The performances of the good, the bad, and the ugly characters. Clint Eastwood shines in this classic western as he and Sergio Leone have done it again! The most impressive Man with No Name western, without a doubt. There is plenty of action going on in this western, be it gunfights or Civil War battles. Three gunslingers go on a hunt for $200,000, and let me tell you: this expedition for money has been the most entertaining journey I've seen. Twists and turns everywhere, anybody would love this classic. Unfortunately, this is the conclusion of the adventures of Clint Eastwood's character, the Man with No Name. But the conclusion has been his greatest adventure of the trilogy. I give this film a score of 10/10. Classic western beauty as Eastwood travels through the western frontier in search of priceless cash. There is also a bit of humor in this film, for those who seek mirth in western films. This movie has been a very inspiring film to me and I'm positive that it will inspire many other audiences in the future.  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is an immortal classic that will stay as a classic for generations to come. Bravo, once again, Eastwood and Leone. Bravo.",

GBU is been the inspiration of film makers all around the world and still lives in the heart of film makers. after seeing this film i became a fan of Leone and collected all his films, but still i believe this is his best work. some movies fade away from our memories but some would live in our memories for ever, this is the best of them...",

Ugly survives, wants vengence. The Bad wants to find the gold chest, tries to find Bill Carson. Ugly makes Good hang himself, but the house they are in explodes, Good runs away. Ugly finds out that Carson is in army. Ugly finds Good, makes him walk in desert. Then a random car comes from nowhere, inside there is Bill Carson, tells Ugly that he can make him rich by telling where the treasure is. He tells the place as a graveyard, but doesn't tell which grave it is. He tells it to the Good, Ugly didn't hear it, so he can't kill good. Carries Good to the church and heals him there.

The epic, magnificent ending for the Dollars trilogy by Sergio Leone is also the best film. You can find everything you can expect from a western movie: gun challenges, tricks, frauds, deserts, the hunt for treasure, bandits, all brilliantly directed by Leone. Action, irony, thrilling. Clint Eastwood is, as always, perfect as the ""man with no name"": mysterious, no past, no emotions, the only thing we know is that he wants money. Lee van Cleef is also great for his ""bad guy"" role, it fits him so very well that now I can't imagine him in a different role than Angel Eyes. But the best of the three is maybe Eli Wallach: his acting performance is simply impressive. This film gave us so many famous phrases that we keep using them even now. The scenes have a perfect synchronicity. And the music is a masterpiece by Ennio Morricone.

The movie itself had a decent storyline. The problem with this movie, however, was that it is the longest, drawn out movie known to mankind. This movie could have been played out in literally 20 minutes based on what all happened in the movie. Instead, viewers get to wait 30 minutes while it shows Clint Eastwood crawl 20 feet through the sand not saying a word. Against my better judgment, I continue watching, waiting for something spectacular to happen in the end. As the end approaches, viewers get to wait through yet another drawn out scene, of 3 men standing in a triangle pointing guns at each other. After, 10 minutes of watching that, I lost interest of who was going to die anyway. It literally switches cameras more times than I can count. Then, the finale comes.

736,1 September 2019,FrankNSteinSinatra,9, Illogical but it works,"Here is why I dropped one star. The praising critics for this movie don't realize that plot is after all full of holes and the movie in general hard to swallow. Of course, the cast and the music, everything you hear and see is admirable, but the esthetics are precisely why audience let them be manipulated. For instance, how Van Cleef was recruited to the army as a sargeant? Secondly, the handgun accuracy (compare to ""Assassination of Jeese James (2009)"". There are some ultrarealistic shots (woman fainting after his husband and son are murdered, or the execution scene) but the film is not after all about cynical realism but pop fiction similar to Tarantino's Pulp Fiction: continuation of incredible timing and coincidences. Entertaining though.
In other words, this film with other music score and with less-known stars, and everybody would attack the weakness and details of the plot... So this is more comic book and farce (Eastwood shooting Wallach with cannon!) than realism.
But the film is still 9/10 fiction adventure. After re-watching this I understood how much there are mediocre films, and they are many.",

Also interesting is just how many great films came to be influenced by this so-called ""spaghetti"" western. Tarantino's KILL BILL films are one of the most recent and obvious examples.

And arguably even better, because the movie is simply perfect and always leaves me with a good feeling. Eli Wallach's best performance ever. And the most iconic soundtrack ever by legendary composer Ennio Morricone. It describes the civil war. I know some critics call this a spaghetti western, because it is kind of made within that genre if you look at the financing and location, but this is far, far better than any spaghetti western, any western, or any movie. This is simply another masterpiece of the master himself Sergio Leone. Of course there is no Leone without Ennio Morricone, and let us not forget the whole crew especially the camera man. Perfect props, completely according to the time and place, Leone would study history, pictures from those days, etc etc and went to great difficulty to get all the details right and it shows. Frankly speaking there has never been any movie, save and accept Leone's movies, that come close to the historical details like this movie (except, perhaps, Barry Lyndon from Kubrick). And that is nothing compared to the acting, and the story. This is not only part of American film history, and a classic, this movie is painstakingly describing a part of history, the civil war in the U.S., in a way that has never been seen.

Not to take anything away from John Ford, but Leone brought a style to audiences in his ""spaghetti westerns"" that no one else could have thought possible. He stays true to the rugged, gritty feel of American westerns, but his obvious inspiration from Kurosawa's samurai films, and Leone's own personal style come together in a fascinating way that I feel is too individualistic for anyone else to have created. The characters in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly seem so alive, so rich and developed. It all seems so real that watching this can make you feel like you have stumbled upon another world, and certainly, another way of life, that has been going on forever, and will continue on long after you have left. Clint Eastwood's iconic performance as Blondie is brilliant. His unflinching confidence in every move he makes tells you right away that this is not a man to be trifled with. He never cracks under pressure, and he seems to have such a tight grasp of every situation that one would be a fool NOT to side with him. Blondie is every bit as cool, calm, and collected as Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon, and also every bit as rewarding to watch! Lee Van Cleef is menacing as Angel Eyes, a bounty hunter who gives the impression that he never met a man who could come close to making him feel threatened. Then, there is Tuco, played by Eli Wallach. Tuco, as dastardly as he is, serves as the comic relief, which is important in a film like this that is filled with tension (the montage in the cemetery is classic!). This movie has action, suspense, drama, and humor, all of which are flavored with Ennio Morricone's famous score and the brilliant cinematography of Tonino Delli Colli. I have not seen enough of Leone's films to say that this is his best, but I can say that this is an excellent film, worthy of all of the praise it has received since its release!",

I'm not trying to say the movie is bad but it ultimately fails in comparison to Fistfull of Dollars. First of all this movie is way too long. About 3 hours long which is way too long for a movie such as this. The story is basically about three guys who are seeking confederate gold hidden in a cemetery. The story is simple but also effective. But for such a simple story why would the movie be so long and drawn out? Scenes seem to take forever to progress forward. Another thing is that Lee Van Cleef is scarcely shown on screen which just leaves Eli and Eastwood on screen most of the time. The music is spectacular. Ennio Morricone has some of the greatest western scores ever composed on the silver screen. Honestly the themes are too epic for the movie to handle. The final duel in the cemetery is nothing short of amazing but the battle ends poorly. I was waiting for Leone to pull a trick out of his sleeve for this final duel like in Fistfull of Dollars but instead he just decided to make it standard. If you have three hours to blow then definitely check it out or just skip to the end of the movie because the build up in the duel is so effin' epic!!",

This adventure movie is able to address so many different conflicts throughout its run time. These conflicts include; family struggles, friendship, and the struggle of soldiers during the war. This movie also has my favorite soundtrack in it, composed by Ennio Morricone. The songs in this movie add to the beauty of some scenes and are definitely recognizable.

Clint Eastwood plays the Man with No Name who along with Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach hunt for a stolen cash box filled with gold coins buried in a cemetery during the American Civil War. They each know only one part of where the gold is buried so they have to keep each other alive despite the fact they want to kill each other. This 3 hour movie moves along gracefully and never gets boring. The final cemetery scene and standoff between the three main characters is riveting. Once again the score is unforgettable.

Lee van Cleef does an excellent job, too, though in his case it's as much thanks to physiognomy as acting. Of the three title characters, Clint Eastwood's is by far the least interesting. Eastwood is also the weakest actor by a mile. The first half of the film is really very good. The dubbing is a tad distracting, but you get used to it after a bit. The second half, from the moment the kitsch, totally anachronistic and overly sentimental music comes on -- made even worse by the fact that we're supposed to believe it's a bunch of ragged POWs playing it -- the entire thing starts to derail.

The technique used here is called DIRECTING. it is a lost art that has been replaced by EDITING. The difference can be seen by comparing the two minutes uncut scenes in this film with the three second splice-o-rama flicks seen today. Guess what, to be a good director you might have to think ahead thirty seconds. imagine that! I watched this today and it put to shame every movie I've seen in the last ten years. when you have a movie where no one speaks and the camera angle doesn't change for 90 seconds yet you are completely riveted to the screen, then you have made something worth watching.

I first saw this film when I was a kid about eight or nine years old, and even though it is three hours long, I was transfixed to the screen for the duration. Now I am not a big western fan. In fact I hate those corny John Wayne and Ronald Reagan movies where cowboys are either good or bad and the women are even more obedient than the horses. Nobody in this film has any morals and they all inhabit a dog-eat-dog vision of the west that not even the civil war can civilize. And that's the other great thing about this movie. It weaves in the U.S. civil war as effortlessly as other westerns introduce the Stetson hat. Lee van Cleef,Eli Wallach and Clint Eastwood are the men who personify the good,bad and ugly of the title.

The music is good, but for some reason there were major sound problems on the DVD I rented. It was not the Collector's edition that came out in 2005 - it was a single disc that had the movie only, from MGM-UA Home Video. Some of the music had a tinny, low-fidelity, transistor-radio quality. There was also a lack of sync between the soundtrack and the video for the entire movie. The actors' lips were not in sync with the words on the soundtrack. Better rent the Collector's edition instead.",

850,3 January 2010,Shinzons,10, Superb. Could possibly be the perfect movie.,"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is one of the most famous and well known movie titles ever, and for good reason: The movie that it titles could just be perfect. When i say perfect i mean to say that it's narrative and plot, the way it develops and unfolds, and the way it concludes itself is probably the ideal way any movie should be shaped. For half of the film we don't even know what the plot is; things simply happen and build up, and then in the second half the goal of the characters comes into being. The filmmakers do this in such a way that the film, plot less at first, could go any direction, and we are taken happily along for the ride. And when it does go into a direction, we are ready to set out on it. It isn't plot less in a bad way, actually the best way possible, because we are entertained and engrossed, and at the same time have a sense of possibility. The famous score is incredible and actually sounds pretty modern, so there isn't that feeling of dated music. The acting is excellent, Clint is as always very cool, and there is even a good anti-war message that materializes in the last act, one that is very touching. If you want to see a perfectly made movie, then you should see this. and soon.",

What I liked the most about the movie (excluding the soundtrack, which was terrific) is the character of Tuco, and the relation he had with Blondie. There were moments when I hated Tuco, and a few minutes later I feeled sorry for him... He was the most balanced or more human character in the movie. He was bad yeah, but not entirely bad. Blondie liked him but didn't thrust him completly, and that was the right thing to do. I loved that sometimes they helped eachother, and sometimes they wanted to kill eachother guts.

869,3 August 2017,gudduabi,10, 3 hours of magnificence that is exquisite and unsurpassed,"TGTBATU is one of my personal favorites and nearly flawless. This is by far the most brutal, ruthless, stylish, macho western ever made with outstanding cinematography and perfect score. The original poster of the movie exemplifies the theme "" For three men civil war was not hell it was practice. The movie delineates the story of three men with ulterior motives behind a $2,00,000 fortune in a far off cemetery. 3 hours may seem daunting but no scene is worth jettisoning. Sergio leone,s penultimate western manifests his class and truly elevates Leone- Eastwood team to that of Ford and his tutelage John Wayne thought the former has not received their fair share of credit. The movie is overwhelmed with long action sequences, one liner retorts , glorious scripting and breathtaking landscape. The immaculate Ennio Morricone theme deserves a special encomium which proliferated intensity and an uncomfortable tense to the film. The film establishes it is not the number of characters but the performance that matter. The bad is a vicious union officer who ruthlessly pursues his objective. The Good is not necessarily good barring a few acts of kindness but with his riposte and style proved to outwit others and makes him a standout bounty hunter. The ugly who forms the crux of the movie is a ragged, poor and a bandit who is humorous. Tuco stole the show with his riveting performance but neither Angel Eyes or Blondie lagged. Angel eyes manifests brutality and thought Eastwood does not have a strong presence as it,s predecessors he makes a case for why he is one of the most complete actors of his generation. 3 hours never create a mundane atmosphere as each scene is meticulously taken. The opening scene, the Mexican standoff, the bare landscapes portrayed are stand offs of a truly great movie. It is sad to see spaghetti westerns were never acclaimed as American westerns despite works like these. 3 hours, 3 stellar performances, the final standoff, the theme, the screenplay all backed up with the visionary direction of Sergio Leone make this the greatest spaghetti western of all time and one of the greatest movies ever made.",

A lot has been written about it already, so I'll just make it very short: Leone wanted to make a cool, gritty, badass drama, so he casted Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, respectively. Brilliant choices, brilliant concept, brilliant finale. Greed has led three men into a deadly scramble for a chest of gold. The standoff takes place at Sad Hill Cemetery, and it is the most memorable standoff in movie history, with 'The Ecstasy of Gold' the icing on this cake of perfection. Gives me goosebumps every time just thinking about Tuco running over that cemetery. 10/10",

And I really don't know how many times I have seen this movie again and again. A perfect movie. Each shot is without any mistake. I love each shot of this movie. Sergio has taken 200% of all the characters in movie. Unforgettable close-ups, sets, music, acting and direction is nothing but the core of this movie. Try to recall demolition of bridge! My all time favorite character is Tuco, what a greedy character, I haven't seen such a character in any movie. Tuco gargles his mouth with water in desert, spitts in his hand and then puts his wet hand on his face, just to protect himself from sun, I have never seen such acting or imagination in any movie. The way he says ""Blondie dont die blondie"" when he realized that blondie knows the name of grave. The way he eats with Angle eye when he gets caught. He doesn't eat until Angel eye eats from his plate, just to make sure that nothing is mixed (poison may be) in his food. And his expression "" I know I know (food is clean) when Angel eye eats from his plate. The way he tries to convince Blondie in his priest brother's place. ""Blondie we both are alone, you have me and I have you...... the way Tuco tries to get name of grave, it is unforgettable. And the way he joins Blondie again and kills Angel Eye's five men, he doesnt care about his own death when it comes to $200,000 gold coins. And finally he runs runs and runs in circle in semetary, that kind of scene is never seen before, again what an imagination of sergio and what an acting of Tuco. And in last shot 3 men with guns and gold coins, unbelievable. And finally Tuco with half gold, or half gold with Tuco. I have never seen characters like Blondie( a real hero) and Angel Eye( the greatest villain of all the time). Just recall your memory and see the way Angel eye looks at everybody, sharp look with sharp direction. This movie is a real tribute to cinema. You can learn so many things from it.",
873,13 August 2000,Bandithaze,10, The good the Bad and the Brilliant,This is probably one the finest westerns ever made. From beginning to the end it is simply brilliant. The story of the man with no name continues in the third installment of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. Clint Eastwood is at his best Lee Van Cleef is always impressive but Eli Walach's portrayal of Tuco was the best. What I like most about the film is that it is 2 and half hours long and does not have a single wasted scene. It stays intense throughout the entire film right from the opening scene with to the very last. This is of cause partly to do with Ennio Morrocone's haunting musical score.,

I was sceptical to watch this film at first mainly because it is a 'spaghetti western' which isn't my favourite genre. As soon as the film started, I was captivated and engrossed in this, quite simply, timeless classic. The acting from Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef is truly sublime for it's time. The way the actors used their characters to appeal to the viewer and to allow the viewer to explore the characteristics of each character is a very intelligent decision made by Sergio Leone in this third installment of these 'Spaghetti Westerns'. In truth, I was incredibly impressed and enamoured by the cinematography and the story-line and given that it was at least 30-45 minutes longer than it should have been, it did not bother me in the slightest. This is truly an epic film and unsurprising that it is considered the 8th best film of all time.",

I think i saw it at least 2 or 3 more times in theaters over time and countless TV viewings before the home video age made it possible to view any time i wanted. It was my first DVD purchase after getting a player a few years back. It is interesting how it has become a critical favorite over that time. On its initial release critics(those that paid attention) sloughed it off as just another spaghetti western albeit with a bigger budget.

893,21 February 2005,dreaddy2,10, Definitely in the best western ever made.,"I grew up watching westerns and war movies. In our book there are cowboy movies and there are westerns. In cowboy movies the star is always neat, well bathed, and every hair in place even after a bar room brawl. In comparison, the western characters are rugged, dirty, dusty, tattered hat, and generally reflect the rugged outdoor, saddle bound life that tough guys endured in those days (consider a Terrence Hill movie where he takes off his hat and one can see where the dirt stops and his real skin starts.) The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is definitely a western and has everything one would want in a movie: a solid and interesting story plot, excellent acting, a ground-breaking director with wide sweeping shots and interesting close-ups, and one of the best music scores one would hear in a movie by the master Enio Morricone. The only western coming anywhere close to GBU is Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. And a race between these two would would still result with GBU ahead for best picture prize because of the fantastic Morricone music score. See the revised version now out on DVD which includes scenes previously cut from the cinema version in the Western World. Some complained this movie is too long. Even with the added scenes it's still too short for me. I wish this movie would be granted a belated Oscar for best western ever made.",

This movie is a Western (as opposed to ""cowboy movies made by John Wayne where the men are always clean and hair well combed even after a fistfight). It focuses on three characters, none of whom is really good. It's characters are real and the scenery stark and harsh as is the style of Sergio Leone.  What takes this movie over the top is the superb music score by Ennio Mirricone whose theme song for this movie was whistled for decades. Westerns don't get better than this. A must see.",

It's probably the best movie with Mr. Clint Eastwood aka Blonde. Sergio Leone's magnificent and ingenious direction in synergy with Ennio Morricone's surreal music, Tonino Delli Colli's breathtaking cinematography and Joe D'Augustine's punctilious editing makes the movie, a treat to watch and ineffably unforgettable. Initially aimed to be a tongue-in-cheek satire on run-of-the-mill westerns, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, continues to stand the test of time in its endeavor to attain apotheosis (if it hasn't attained it yet).

Well years later and seen again this movie has gotten better. It keeps getting better as one matures. How many movies do that? Have ever done that? Even the critics matured to worship this wonderful film. Anything else I say is merely repeating what others have said.

I am in awe at practically everything about this movie. The story is indelible -- a chase across the wild Civil War laden frontier for a supposed $200,000 of stolen Confederate gold buried in a cemetery somewhere. All sorts of gunshots fired, men fallen, twists and turns of faith within the plot -- you never know what to expect next. The relationship between Blondie (Clint Eastwood) and Tuco (Eli Wallach) is so ambivalent that it's entertaining. Each strands the other in the middle of a vast desert, each has opportunities to kill the other. But ultimately they team up with the common goal of acquiring great riches - - though you never know when someone may turn on the other.",

The movie is fun to watch, has the classic bad guys, good guys, plenty of gun-slinging as well as an actual plot woven into it. The acting is very good by the primary actors; Eastwood, Wallach and Cleef. The directing is typical of Leone with lot's of close-ups to get the facial expressions, adding to the 'feel' of the moment. TGTBTU does contain some minor historical gaffs, but to the untrained eye, they are mostly subtle enough to not distract from the movie. TGTBTU never slows down enough to let a viewer become lost or distracted by other things; if viewing in-home, keep the 'pause button' handy. Another feature that I enjoyed is the loose connection between TGTBTU and the two previous films: Fist Full of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More.",

The duel-scene at the end of the movie is legendary, but my favorite scene of the movie is Tuco's Run for Gold, the music is absolutely haunting. The movie has epical scenes countered by a fantastic musical score by Morricone. Ik know the movie by heart just waiting for every scene that has become legendary in movie history. One of my all time favorites!!!!!!",

This movie is outstanding and should never be a remake(i heard there would be, sigh) because it needs to be preserved like other rop movies that have had sequels that do not live up to it(The Manchurian Candidiate).

The soundtrack is just out of this world and over the top wonderful, and the story is just so classic ""western"" mythology. This film has so obviously influenced so many creations since, from ""Star Wars"" to ""Cowboy Beebop."" The main characters are such archetypes of the classic American male, but none of them is truly a stereotype; they all have crystal clear dimension and personality. They definitely do not make films like this any more!

I've not seen many things with Eastwood that varied from this however. If you are into gratuitous violence and bloodshed, then this film certainly has that.

921,27 September 2014,sakrtheeagle,10, great story in this era,"In the last and the best installment of his so-called ""Dollars"" trilogy of Sergio Leone-directed ""spaghetti westerns,"" Clint Eastwood re-prised the role of a taciturn, enigmatic loner. Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly (Eli Wallach), a Mexican bandit. Though dubbed ""the Good,"" Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster. The film's title reveals its ironic attitude toward the canonized heroes of the classical western. ""The real West was the world of violence, fear, and brutal instincts,"" claimed Leone. ""In pursuit of profit there is no such thing as good and evil, generosity or deviousness; everything depends on chance, and not the best wins but the luckiest."" Immensely entertaining and beautifully shot in Techniscope by Tonino Delli Colli, the movie is a virtually definitive ""spaghetti western,"" rivaled only by Leone's own Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). The main musical theme by Ennio Morricone hit #1 on the British pop charts. Originally released in Italy at 177 minutes, the movie was later cut for its international release. ~ Yuri German, Rovi",
922,3 May 2004,mtiller12,10, Film making perfection,"""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" was Sergio Leone's third film in the Dollar trilogy and is easily the best. Taking place around the Civil War, the film revolves around three men, The Good in Blondie (Clint Eastwood), The Bad in Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) and The Ugly in Tuco (Eli Wallach). All three men have knowledge about a grave of gold and the uneasy alliances formed to achieve their goal in retrieving the cash is what the film is about. ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is sometimes touted as the pinacle in Leone's career but this film is where he will be remembered. Nearly every scene in this film is a classic and defines everything about Leone's skills, talents and his style of directing and story telling. Cinematography is excellent with gritty locations and vast green landscapes capturing the screen. Performances are perfect with Wallach leading the way, playing a character who is not just the film's comic point but a complete character and not just someone to laugh at to loosen tension. Eastwood's Man With No Name (he adopts Blondie) shows new depth to his acting and his delivery never falters, playing a character now iconic. Lastly Van Cleef plays Angel Eyes in one of the best villain turns in history. Memorable, slick and chilling he is a person you struggle to hold your nerve around, Cleef holds the character together and with little screen time shows what an effect he can have on an audience. Characters in a Leone film are people you will never forget, lines, stances, the eyes. Characters very core are not left exposed and stay with you. Morricone is genius in music and his most memorable score is here, I think ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is his best score but this is his most unforgettable and has the greatest theme in any picture. Morricone is a man on par with Leone for excellence and does the film credit. Now onto the greatest achievment, the directing. Sergio Leone made in total about seven films, this stands as his best in his field. Some directors take in favour style over substance or vice versa, Leone takes both into maximum consideration and is why his films are unique. What you see is as important as what you hear, this applies to viewers who dislike his observing technique. Leone respects the viewer and entices them in every scene to be a part of the action on screen. ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" has that great quality, the acting is perfect, the writing is perfect, the cinematography, sets, sound, editing and directing I can honestly say this film does not lack and is cinimatically perfect.",

There are enormous battle scenes intermixed with the more usual operatic shootouts and epic shots of blank, desert expanses. There are tons of anachronisms in the film, but this isn't really any fault. Leone is not trying to come anywhere close to any form of realism and instead is working with melodrama and stylized acting that creates a well-conceived and detailed western fantasy world that is purely a joy to immerse yourself in.",

928,6 January 2002,Trespassers Will,9, The ultimate western!,"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a classic for the ages. It follows three men, Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes, as they violently move through the U.S. during the Civil War. What motivates these men? $200,000 in stolen gold that is buried in a grave at a cemetery. This movie is a non-stop action ride with one of the greatest and most memorable soundtracks in movie history. This film was also years ahead of it's time, with much more swearing and violence than was acceptable in 1967. Made in Italy, it pretty much beats the crap out of many American westerns out there. There isn't one boring or lagging scene in this movie. If you like westerns, watch it. If you like action movies, watch it. Hell, if you just like movies, watch it. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly does not disappoint. 9/10",
929,17 November 2007,redram91,7, One of the best? No. Potentially one of the best? Absolutely.,"OK, I read most of the reviews on the board for over two weeks now. I am dismayed by the amount of viewers who give this a 10/10 and say nothing poignant or useful. Similarly, ones who give it a 1/10 just say it's overrated. I will try to give depth to why I give this movie a 7/10. The cinematography is spectacular; this movie really does contain some of the best shots I have and ever will see in a movie. The length does not bother me, although there are certainly a few scenes that could have been cut down like the final showdown or some of the Civil War scenes. Now the plot. And here arrives the main problem. Historically and contextually, almost all the weapons and battle scenes are out of their time and place in history. I'm sorry, but I can't award a movie a 10/10 for messing up so many basic historical facts. Besides that, there are scenes that just don't mesh well, and I believe the film is somewhat poor on its pacing such as the scene in the monastery vs. the civil war bridge scene. The acting is decent, but seriously how much depth can any of the actors give with these one sided characters. And here, the next problem arises: The characters themselves have NO depth. One is ugly and greedy, the other is bad and....wicked, the last one is good...and a good shot. There's nothing else about them! At least in some of his other movies like A Fistful of Dollars or Once Upon a Time in the West, all the characters are multi-faceted. Moving right along, the production is fairly decent, but how does it help with so many historical errors? The music......is not that good. I have never understood why so many people think it's amazing. It's very simple and....rather childish to be blunt. Sergio Leone is certainly a qualified and somewhat talented director, but this is not his best movie or even one of his better ones. For a good Leone movie, check out Once Upon a Time in the West. That's my favorite. Again, this is not a bad movie, just not ""the best western"" or ""one of the greatest films ever made"".",

At that time you are watching a 3 hr movie only waiting for Clint's appearances....and the good tune. Now it is a movie about Eli Wallach's character and Clint is more like great background. I also appreciate the entire score more than only the title score. Anybody would have to wonder why is Clint the Good? He leaves Eli in the desert and he is working the law and profiting.Bad Eli has to work so hard to get what falls so easily into Good Clint's hands.But does one really deserve the gold more than the other?For me the hero has become Eli Wallach.One fantastic moment for me is Eli running through the cemetery looking for the grave with the gold.The music is excellent and the editing captures the moment when Eli is gold crazy...I feel sympathy and hope and a lot of things for Eli at that moment.This is so important to him it is tragic.Anyways a happy ending follows and all is well. Always felt this movie lended itself to a prequil in that a history was alluded to in the film between The Good The Bad and The Ugly.,

Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef give 3 iconic performances. There is no good, there is only bad. Although film is named 'The good', none of the characters are heroic. Eastwood is a backstabbing fraud. Wallach is a dirty rebel. And Van Cleef is a lying bounty hunter. The story is the first of its kind, an undeniably iconic story in fact. The soundtrack is one of the best ever made, Ennio Morricone has made countless other iconic tunes, but absolutely none of them can beat his incredible 'Ecstasy of gold'. The film has loads of quotable dialogue such as ""There are 2 kinds of people in this world... Those with loaded pistols... And those who dig... You dig."" Its 3 hour run time flies by, it has a fantastic 3 act structure and a truly unforgettable ending. Strongly recommend this one.",

Every time I hear it, all I can think about is Eli Wallach's great grin, Clint Eastwood's stoic gaze, and Lee Van Cleef's evil eyes. All in great fun, Director Sergio Leone's western epic marked the high point for this genre, and showed that you could do a classy movie in which the leading characters do awful things such as: 1) Double-cross each other constantly; 2) Kill more than their share of men; 3) Condone greed at its fullest form.",

The pathos, character studies, separate story lines and acting draw the viewers in to such a degree that one forgets the genre and gets immersed in the richness of the script and its diversity. Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the Man With No Name is his signature role. Eli Wallach makes Tuco the man you love to hate, and Lee Van Cleef is simply evil (and ""ugly""). The score of Ennio Morricone has become iconic and the core and side show to film festivals featuring director Sergio Leone's other films. The quest for greed and the twist at the end are enough for anyone to identify with who has bought a lottery ticket. The grittiness of the Civil War battle scene and the actions of ""Blondie"" and Tuco to both end the bloodshed and clear the way for their treasure are effective to convey the sense of agony of the Civil War. The prisoner scene and the music played during the torture scene is macabre and surreal.",

940,17 December 2007,travised87,8," The old, gritty West and life in general","A great many people of our current iPod generation have missed out on some of the most brilliant, daring and artistic endeavours in film during the sixties and seventies. That was a period when film still held onto its artistic impulse, when the modern day blockbuster, complete with stunning visual effects, mind-bogglingly fast action sequences, and miraculously thin story lines and characterisations was still in its infancy. Over time, as some nostalgic folk of the 'then' would say, 'the world has become too fast, and kids today don't give a damn about deeper stuff'. Indeed it has; through the development of film over the decades, we see - at least a glimpse of - this seemingly reductive summarisation of the vast social and cultural changes in the world. The legendary final scene of this film, where the three principal characters face, is roughly about five minutes long, from the time they implicitly agree to this 'solution' to the first 'bang' of Eastwood's pistol. In these five minutes, Leone uses music and recurring shots of the men to create the tension, engineering a sense of finality and fatality in the situation that could quite possibly take all their lives. At that critical moment, greater importance is given to this all-encompassing tension, where the entire film's plot and the journey must culminate in a decisive end, than to the eventual outcome, which would be revealed in all eventuality. As audience, Leone wants us to participate in this tension, to completely transport ourselves into the simmering, immoral West, and feel the presence of death as the characters do, and therefore to achieve a cinematic orgasm that involves both the intellectual and visceral, in turn immortalising it. This painstaking attention to detail, the need to go beyond the bare plot and action, and the urge to create a cinematic environment that transcends, is something that we see too little of today. Indeed, we are privy to this intellectual desire from the very start. ",

955,5 May 2004,DavidRobinson10,10, what may I say that hasn't already been said.....,"I first saw this film in 1968 in Sydney, I was 18. I had seen many westerns before and I had seen the first two Leone's in New Zealand the year before. I had also been a fan of CE and LvC for a very long time. The version I saw was cut and many key scenes were truncated or left out completely(I had read the paperback in NZ-great paperback!!!!). Still, I was inspired enough to write a musical composition based on CE's character. This piece was recorded in 1970 and featured on a hit LP I had with my band Blackfeather - it was called Manco's Theme. I recommended the film to everybody I knew at the time. The point to all this, this movie, although wearing 'western' clothes, is the closest thing I've seen to real art in the cinema. Like all great art , it has a life of its own. A++++++ (highest rating I can give)",
956,25 February 2005,Cineman187,9, Better than what you may think,"Sergio Leone is obviously a talented director and he has produced many memorable films in his career. His westerns include the 'spaghetti' trilogy and the very impressive 'Once upon a time in the West'. He also orchestrated a fascinating and enjoyable film later on in the 80's with 'Once upon a time in America'. These are a few of his films and all were very entertaining with their complex and intricate story lines. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is no exception, as we venture into the dry and sandy landscape (filmed in Spain), the characters each find themselves caught in the firing line of the Civil War. Leone has focused on this as he clearly opposed and disliked the war (he felt it was wrong and unjust)and he makes an effort to portray the Civil War as meaningless and conflicting with what should be progression for America. Aside from the political aspect of the film we find a superb story that tells a tale of how three rogue individuals cross paths while searching for a prize more than any 'Wanted' poster could bore. The sum of $200,000 requires all three to form some kind of co - operation and, despite the tense conflict, we are led along their paths to the breathtaking finale where we see the last dance of death between the three gunslingers. Hugely entertaining with its slick dialogue and vast yet intriguing surroundings, we find ourselves in the mist of ferocious gun fights between enemies and old foes. The marvellous score composed by Ennio Morricone is one of the most recognised in film history and it certainly delivers a special added bonus to an already superb film.",

Now, from the time I'm reviewing this film, I've only seen a few westerns including the Magnificent Seven reboot(2016) and the Searchers(1956). The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is my favorite out of all of them. Now this film has by far some of the best one-liners; they are just so good and after they say the line the theme plays! It's just done really well! This film is also very intimidating. There are a lot of scenes were your just waiting for something to happen, and it isn't too predictable about it either. I love the characters! The good, Joe, is a mysterious character and does care about his partner, whom they both team up to get money in a very hilarious way. The ugly, Tuco, is the most expressive and fun character here. Joe doesn't trust him yet at the end they are both partners and have entertaining chemistry throughout the movie. The villain, the bad, is threatening even if he doesn't get too much screen time, which I'm fine with because there are other stuff that make this movie for me. Ultimately, this is one of my favorites and one of the most recognizable classics ever made. I give this movie a: 10/10",

The camera shot when Angel Eyes is holding the candle holds amazing likeness to the shot that introduces Frank (Fonda) in Once Upon a Time in The West. Sergio Leone really takes his time to make the characters three dimensional, the amount of character he gives to Blondie, Angel Eyes and Tuco Ramirez is astounding. This film is about two things, the civil war and the three mens search for gold. The weird humour in it is absolutely brilliant. You can tell Leone put some real elbow grease into this movie.

Watch it a few times more and it will be indelibly imprinted on your soul forever! Such is the power of cinema when it is harnessed in such an incredible way. Pretty much everything has already been said about this film by previous reviewers so I won't rehash it all. However, just 10 seconds or so of one scene - the final three way gunfight(The trio) - sums it up for me: Blondie is already waiting, gun at the ready in the middle, Angel Eyes slowly struts like a peacock towards him. He stops as he comes by Tuco and looks at him, Tuco looks back at him and VERY slowly removes his gun from his pocket with a wry smile as if to say ""someone's going to die here, but I'm in anyway"". Angel eyes just looks back at him and almost imperceptibly acknowledges this and walks on in to the 'arena', but you can see there is a mutual respect between them. Not a word spoken, as if to prove beyond any doubt that cinema is a visual medium!",

Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly (Eli Wallach), a Mexican bandit. Though dubbed ""the Good,"" Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster. The film's title reveals its ironic attitude toward the canonized heroes of the classical western. ""The real West was the world of violence, fear, and brutal instincts,"" claimed Leone. ""In pursuit of profit there is no such thing as good and evil, generosity or deviousness; everything depends on chance, and not the best wins but the luckiest.""

1014,1 June 2004,carydog,10, Greatest...western...ever.,"Without a doubt, this film is a masterpiece. In storytelling, in cinematography, in scope, all in all a great great work. Eastwood, Cleef and Wallach are absolutely superb in their respective roles, and each plays their character to the max. Sergio Leone is simply a genius at work here, and from the moment the film begins to the moment it ends, you will be mesmerized and captivated. This definitely ranks just above Eastwoods' ""Unforgiven"" in the all-time great western film category, as well as the character ""Blondie"" is definitely one of the great characters of all time. Once you've seen this film (hopefully on DVD), you will compare every western movie you've seen and every one you will see to it, and chances are they will fail the test. A must-have for serious DVD collectors.",

Truth is this movie has No Genre, it has everything in it, Action, Comedy, Drama and . . . For Example it has a Black Comedy scene when Blondie (Good) is going for money with Tuco (Ugly) and their caught by north army because they were saying bad things about them, and all of it because the color of North Army uniforms was hidden because of dirt. Sergio Leone, put a lot of word in his great masterpiece, he show a part of history the way it actually was, not the way in suppose to look. The title maybe says ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" and maybe in the movie characters has nicknames like that, But the ugly truth behind this words is that all of those three people are ugly, they kill, they cheat, they murder and they only care about money. The nicknames mostly are about their personality not what they actually do, for example, good is fair, and he is smart and he care about other people either (if you watched the movie with ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and know that Clint Eastwood is the same person). So, if there is a movie that you want to watch and Learn, this is your movie, but, if you want to just see a western movie, you can easily go and watch ""Wild Wild West""",

What really sets it off is that Clint Eastwood is the good guy. the characters playing the bad and the ugly fit right into what they are suppose to be like. They couldn't of picked a better actor for that part. I like how the movie starts off and easily progress up to the end. towards the end when they find all that money and its a stand off, it made the main character look good in winning. But in all in 1966, i would say this is the number one movie of its time starring with Clint Eastwood. This is also one of the best movie Clint Eastwood played in.",

Sergio Leone is showing everyone that he made the best western films ever. His way of making it is unforgettable, a simple plot, low ranking actors, a slow-motion film and the best soundtrack ever. That is his thing in this film. Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef never got the same high status as Clint Eastwood did, and that is a big shame because they are both fantastic, especially Eli Wallach. He got the main role in this film and he is doing it so great, that your starting to like him a lot, although he is a villain, but in the end all the three man are villains. Everyone knows the soundtrack of this movie, some people never saw the movie but they know the music. And it fits perfectly in every scene.

1027,17 September 2003,vitalprince,10, Third in my top 10 movies list of all time.,"I am a big movie fan and i have seen over 10,000 movies. When i made the list of my top ten favorite movies of all time i found this classic western Sergio Leone fame movie on third position, the other two movies (1 ""Gone with wind"" ) and (2 ""Lawrence of Arabia""). I first saw this movie in 1989 when i was just 15 years old and recommended this to my favorites. So why this movie so impressed me, because of the direction, extra ordinary camera work, accurate sets and the magnificent music of the movie. The story is about the three different types of characters. Only one thing which is the common between these three character is seeking to find the buried treasure. Other then these main characters the other co actors also Performed wary well Specially the Storekeeper ""Enzo Petito"" is in so Laughable seen when tuco ""Eli Wallach"" demand him to open the mouth and then put the close sign in to his mid open mouth. this movie is the last epic of the Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood combination and its our bad luck that they never made another movie together.",
1028,6 December 2002,eido888,10, Perfect Western,The late Italian director Sergoi Leone shot through this film a mix of myth and realism which truly adds a new dimension to the style of classic western. All three actors played the role in a perfect way showing a professional and beautiful acting of western action unbeatable till now. The unholy pursuit of these three desperados of the $200'000 in the time of the great civil war makes the story more interesting and not like any other western where all they do is shoot each other. The movie may seem long (2 hours and 42 min) but is worth every minute of it. The music on the other hand is found on a higher level and is worth the Oscar it got. The suspense with the music was integrated together perfectly. A good example of the suspension is at the end when all three players stand facing each other in a trio showdown. I say that if somebody likes westerns then this is the best movie to start with. There are similar movies such as 'A Fistful of Dollars' and 'For a few Dollars more'.,

I have seen other Clint Eastwood westerns, which are usually good entertainment, but I think this is the best Eastwood western that I've seen. The cinematography was great, and the soundtrack was well suited to the scenery. Clint was strong and silent in this movie. Also worth noting is Eli Wallach's performance as ""the ugly"", which I felt was very good. I suppose having a European director is what made it a different movie from most of the western. The Movie looked at times like a European movie that should have subtitles, of course that could be because I already knew that it was filmed by an Italian director in Spain. Mix that with the fact that the theme is American (cowboy western) theme, and it comes out superbly. Bottom line is, it's definitely a movie worth seeing.",

1039,4 August 2014,DarthRater,10, The best Western of all times on so many levels,"""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"" is one of the earliest films I can remember and is probably the only film I would never get sick of watching over and over. IMO, it's not only the best 'Western' ever made, but one of the best films of all time. Not for the picture quality... as it can be a little rough and grainy. Not for the dialog over-dubbing, which is often out of sync due to the range of languages spoken when it was shot. And not for the historical inaccuracies or feasibility of the physical burdens endured by the characters (it's way more realistic than James Bond anyway). Those are what give the film its charm and retro appeal! Personally, I think this film is great because of the overall 'mood' it creates, both visually and audibly. It has, by far, one of the most unusual and recognizable music scores in movie history, blending the traditionally-used orchestral brass section with human whistles, cackles, grunts, and an electric guitar, to create a tapestry of sound that strangely fits perfectly (even though the time period depicted predates the electric guitar by more than half a century). Then, in the spaces, the wind-blown desolation in the sound track really gives you the sense of being there with the characters in that barren desert. It's the dynamic range in both the soundtrack and the pacing of the story that sets such a great undercurrent for the talented trio to do their magic. All three seasoned actors with impressive credits both before and after this film seemed to cross paths at just the right time in their careers to face off in their most memorable performances to date. And rather than a typical Western--one wronged man against a whole town; a masked hero and his trusty sidekick; or a rag-tag posse banding together only to get killed off one by one by bandits--this is three distinct personalities going head to head to head, each with a little good, a little bad, and a little ugly in them to varying degrees. On the script side, it's really more of a human interest story than an action film. And it poignantly bullet-points (no pun intended) that often the ""good guy"" really only needs to be the ""least bad"" of the bunch to obtain that moniker, which has all sorts of parallels in all walks of life. To fully rave about all the intricacies of this masterpiece would take a novel. But these are just a few aspects that make it a timeless classic and well worth watching.",

What I failed to get out of my expectation is the sense of morality. Surely, in the west you don't expect anyone behave like a citizen. But there was something in the protagonists of the previous two films that makes them respectable and distinguished from the ""just villains"" - they live by a code, which I have not seen too much in this film. With the heroic macho melodies, the thing you are supposed to appreciate is not the noble soul, but purely power, physical, skilly or cunningly speaking. Seeing men who have been through life and death together now betraying, lying and setting up each other, you cannot really relate them to macho or ""cool"". Sure you can say Sergio has made his moral judgment by building the character ""the good"" (and even he betrayed Tuco the ugly at first). But the lack of creed in each figure has generally made the film less enjoyable.",

What I would say is that once upon a time in the west also directed by Sergio is better especially to a film buff. But this like all of Sergio's spaghetti westerns (called so because they were made by Italians yet often filmed in Spain) is fantastic, quite often the guns used maybe historically inaccurate but Sergio did this on purpose, and was more interested in the western films that influenced him and payed tribute to them in some way which is now called intertextuality or post modern directing on Sergio's behalf.

An impressive combination of great humor and hard violence that works just perfect, impressive because it never feels awkward like one might fear it would get. The style of the action is perfectly done and like stated it is quite violent maybe more than one might suspect if you don't know anything about the movie. The characters are superb, Clint Eastwood is of course the best and the coolest. The bad is a really brilliant villain and the ugly is great comic relief.

The scene where Tuco and Blondie destroy the bridge with dynamite is fantastic. It truly is amazing how Tuco and Blondie become partners and enemies at the same time and figure out a way to work together and defeat Angel Eyes for the gold.

This movie breaks all of those stereotypes. It supports a cast that couldn't be better suited for who they played. This movie has three important characters that everything else revolves around. It creates a unique situation where two of those characters are forced to ally. Tuco tries to hide his true feelings from Blondie so he can get the gold, but Blondie knows better and uses his knowledge to keep himself alive. The Ugly will stop at nothing to get the gold for himself, which leads up to one of the best movie scenes ever: the three man shoot out. The men guessing and second guessing in their minds who to shoot, because they know they get only one shot. When they decide to take out The Ugly, Blondie holds a gun up to Tuco and tells him to put his head in a noose, he leaves him half the gold, but rides off as if to let him die in the noose, but returns and shoots the rope, thus showing that they really did have a friendship.

Any typical Western clich√© that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling. Of special mention is Ennio Morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect.

It definitely deserves its very high reviews and I don't expect them to go down any time soon. It's really easy to get a hold of because its free on amazon prime so you can watch it.

Interesting plot with a lot of twisted,as road in Poland, situations that were used not only in other movies but in some cult computer games too ( for example in Fallout ). Actors that do they best. I like each of them but for some reasons I like tuco most. maybe because he is more ""human"" than other two? The operator work... I love these moments when he is showing only eyes.

I remember the first time I saw this movie. Back in the '70s, one night there was 2 things on TV to choose from, this movie or a baseball game. How do I remember a baseball game, it was the night Hank Aaron was going after Babe Ruth's homerun record. Baseball or a movie. Tuned into the the baseball game, flipped to the movie -a western, cool. 'Uh, what is this no one is talking it makes no sense'. After what seemed like an eternity somebody finally spoke, Lee van Cleef. The rest is Movie History. Since then I have seen this movie well over 25 times. Numerous lines that have been etched into my memory. Forget whatever minor flaws this movie has. Put yourself in the movie. Sergio Leon, John Ford these are the people that defined ""The Western"". On a scale of 1-10, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is nothing less than a 10. Plop the tape into the VCR, sit back and experience a classic.",

When I first saw it, I was drawn in by the imaginative camrea angles, the massive battle scene, the quest for gold, and the character of Blondie himself, a man of mythical proportions. The music perfectly compliments this sprawling atmosphere with one of the most memorable tunes ever. To put it simply this movie has everything, a great plot, great characters, eerily beautiful landscapes, wonderful music, and fantastic scenes. Even though their is come geographical errors in this movie( Its set in the Western U.S., but there are battles between the Union and the Confederates?), they don't bring it down. In fact i think they fuel its mythological feel, like this is a legend that isn't bound to historical accuracy. A geat movie that i highly recommend to everyone",

A movie full of Ironic twists of fate that reaches the dimensions of an ancient drama,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a movie par excellence. Not only does Sergio Leone in close cooperation with Ennio Morricone and his groundbreaking score manage to create a masterpiece of modern movie history. He also revolutionizes the Western by shifting the clean and glorified image of the west that existed so far and changing it into a dirty, often ugly and very brutal face. Furthermore he underlines some of the motives that kept this era going as they do today. Greed, violence and the absolute fight for survival and sometimes the strongest one revenge (which is a dominant factor in his movie Once Upon a Time in the West). ",

A lot of camera shots and music have been copied over and over again in other various movies, even if film-directors didn't know it. Cinema has been strongly influenced by Leone. Many reviews are very well written about the good the bad a the ugly here and elsewhere. Even people who don't like westerns should, no must see this movie because of the complete cinema picture.

The directors slowly piecing everything together while still keeping the audience interested. There was also a bit of comedy for the viewers. Of course, it doesn't have the special effects of new movies, but I didn't find that too annoying.

A hypothetical adventure is the best way to describe the plot. Imagine a setting of the west during the civil war. Imagine three characters that embody man's natural inhibitions allowed to roam free without restrain. Even the Good would have to be a little bad just to keep up. Or in this case, the Good better be real ""good"". These men are searching for a treasure, and anyone that gets in their way is in danger. The characters are masterfully cast.

Clint Eastwood is as cool as ever, as the man with no name, Lee Van Cleef is sinister as the evil gunslinger, but it is Eli Wallach who steals the film with his portrayal of the street fighter, willing to try any ruse to get his hands on the gold. The action takes place amid the carnage being caused by the 2 sides in the American Civil War, with all 3 gunmen using the situation to best further their own goals.

1113,2 February 2006,ClintsUnforgiven,10, Excellent Storytelling,"I may have seen a few movies equal to The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly but i have never seen a movie that i would claim was better. Commenting first on the story. Intricate plot connections with character and human nature pushing the story along with a war playing a significant supporting character make this one of the greatest stories ever shown on film. Leone does an excellent job of not jumping right into the treasure hunt aspect of he film but instead lets the characters develop and interact and then fall upon the main story line. It is often said that Leone was special due to the fact that he realized the face as a landscape. This is ever evident in the opening shot of the film in which we see one of Tuco's many enemies, but only the very front of his face at first showing a worn, torn, mean side of the previously over glorified American West. The character appears mean and tough and as though anyone who crosses him is sure to meet a hasty end. This is not the case however when ""the Ugly"" Tuco Ramirez bests him and his comrades even when matched against he element of surprise. Here is evident part of the humor of the film, the unassuming Tuco, however flawed he may be, is never the less a master of armed combat. It is his character, made lovable with such contradictions, that pushes the plot along. Many people look to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid as the father of all buddy movies but this was released earlier and while Tuco and Eastwood's characters aren't exactly friends(it seems that Blondie just favorites Tuco as a partner due to the fact that he can easily be out witted) they have some very entertaining interaction and really start the whole unwanted partnership theme so oft copied by the movies that would follow. This them has developed to the point of being the almost exclusive relationship appearing in todays animated films such as Shrek and Ice Age. This film does so much with story yet doesn't compromise an ounce of style. The camera work is phenomenal and creates a mood so strong that even if you don't care for a specific character you can still be fearful for the situation he is in. The music is unforgettable and has remained in pop culture to this day. This movie has something for everyone, it is epic, has comedy, has action, drama, character driven plot, and just plain looks stunning.",

Lee Van Cleef ('The Bad') is evil personified. Totally ruthless, he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Clint Eastwood ('The Good') is the Man With No Name, not really 'good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing. (Watch the scene when he gives a dying Confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up everything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single word.) Eli Wallach ('The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film.

Morricone's music is at its highs and perfectly follow the images. The screenplay is complex but, as it interweaves humor and drama, it is not boring.

The career-making performances by Eli Wallach (hilarious), Lee Van Cleef (chilling) and Clint Eastwood (cool) are nothing short of iconic, and the film's finale is so good it will send shivers of cinematic joy down your spine. It's a movie of epic proportions; it's funny and violent, but underneath it all there is a strong anti-war message. It's a cinematic masterpiece and one of the most influential movies of all time.

A western of epic proportions and of epic length despite being shot on a very low budget.

Leone, the king of the Spaghetti Western, and one of the all time greatest filmmakers truly outdoes himself with his classic, 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly'. With this installment of the ""Dollars"" trilogy, during the Civil War, we find Blondie (Clint Eastwood), ""the man with no name"", in a not so morally sound partnership with an outlaw/bandit, Tuco (Eli Wallach). The two characters go from town to town performing a genius scheme that is Blondie catching Tuco and turning him in for money, and then setting him free the day of the execution. They split the reward and prosper, until one day Blondie ends the partnership, causing Tuco to begin a hunt for Blondie, until they cross paths with deadly bounty killer, Angel Eyes. Now its a three man witch hunt, and to make matters worse, they all get word of buried Union gold. Now a race for buried gold, and vengeance, is underway as the three men will do anything to prosper. With classic Leone intense close-ups, shootouts, and unique dialogue. 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' is one for the ages, and will forever go down as one of the most phenomenal films in history.",

From the opening scene where hit men gather in a deserted town, saying nothing, but express determination in fulfilling their objective, to the last duel where every tiny detail is filmed from eyes to fingertips. This in combination with greatly build sets (without CGI at the time) like a POW camp, a mysterious cemetery in the middle of nowhere, but above all the real naturalistic recordings at deserts and desert mountain areas. It really gives you the feeling of the real deal, outside Hollywood studies and that's what makes a spaghetti western great. You almost wish to be a cowboy yourself.

It was only behind Godfather 1 & 2, and this makes them seem like a soap opera compared to a Best Picture Oscar nominee. Speaking of which, this is the best movie ever made to have never recieved a single oscar nomination. Nowadays, Clint Eastwood would've gotten Best Actor. Eli Wallach would've gotten Best Supporting Actor. Lee Van Cleef would've gotten a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Sergio Leone, Best Director. Screenplay, cinematography, musical score, the list goes on. It's not only the definitive western, but it has several other elements and plot lines. It's also a drama, a suspense film, a war film, an action flick, and a treasure hunt movie. With no details, it also has the greatest ending to a film ever put on screen. But everything about this movie is what makes it an all-time classic. Especially the reason it could never be successfully remade.

In a time of Hollywood heroes, horrifying villains and not many people in between, Leone submits one of his many masterpieces to exhibition, at a time when America had given up on the western because it had nowhere else to go. This film offers no heroes, gives you a villain and places a slimy little dog like tuco into the midst of the most realistic portrayal of the west the way it was. Sad, lonely and most certainly devoid of John Ford colour. Ironic really that one of the most loved westerns of all time was made in Europe. Good job really, though. The Americans never could get their history right. Clint has never been so squinty, Wallach so perfectly cast and Leone so frankly plain. Film fans, this is a must see.

That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Eli Wallach, Lee Van Cleef, Clint Eastwood are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful direction from legend Sergio Leone as well. This film probably had the largest impact on my life. It set the tone for everything I then got interested in. American Civil War. Film Music. Clint Eastwood. Real Westerns. This is the best of the Dollars Trilogy and by far one of the best Westerns of all time. It has drama, comedy, cracking dialog, some of the most brutal battle scenes - especially around the bridge - that I'd seen up to then, music to die for and set pieces that just ooze atmosphere and tension. I have never forgotten the end shoot-out. It was just simply incredible.",
1186,2 October 2004,vincentrizzo,10, Timeless Classic,Having watched this film originally in the early 70's it was easy to distinguish this as a serious attempt at a spaghetti Western unlike the comical Trinity movies with Henry Fonda. There are so many scenes that are interwoven masterfully with one of the best musical scores from legend Morricone. The cassette tape of the score made excellent driving music in its time. I did see this in Italy in the 80's where it has always been intermittently screened since its original release but was a tad disappointed at the condition of the print. The new double disc DVD finally does this film justice as it blows up well in a big screen HT. They added stereo to the mono soundtrack and even managed to tune up the picture quality a bit from the previous anamorphic DVD. (If only they would enhance the other 2 films in Sergio's trilogy).,

1189,22 November 2004,jleoussis,10, The other West,"I first watched Leone's trilogy when i was 12 years old. For the past 10 years, i have remained faithful and watched them at least once a month. One word could sum up this director's work: masterpiece. The very simplicity of the sceneries and the scenario, the chasteness of the characters, the alternative view on the West, even the minor faults in the shootings represent the reasons why Leone's movies are still the benchmark of all westerns. In this last film of the trilogy, the masterpiece concludes by portraying an image of the Far West that American western directors could've never even dreamt of. The pursuit for gold, the atrocities of the Civil War, human vices, all brilliantly presented by Leone. And all the above come in a movie that has no room for fresh, clean, crispy shirts that characters in various other westerns wear; And no, the sheriff is not a brave hero that shoots the bad Indians but only a man trying to make a living, the cities in Far West are not full of posh-ladies and righteous people, and above all when people get shot at surprisingly they get hurt! The picture of the West althoug not a rosy, happy one still is as real as it gets. And by featuring one of the coolest picture characters (Eastwood), a bad character whose just the voice gives u the creeps (Cliff), and one of the funniest characters ever to appear on a western (Tuco), this movie resembles perfection in its kind.",

1191,11 December 2004,sergiomena,10, this movie is under rated,"This movie is terribly under rated. This movie seems to have almost everything. Leone makes it so that we feel such compassion for his characters. One of the best parts of the films may be when Tuco is talking to his brother and when he's talking to Blondie about the great relationship he has with his brother, the priest. This movie is set on an epic scale and Leone steps up to the challenge of directing what Tarantino calls the 'best movie ever directed.' The opening sequence of credits may be the best I've ever seen. Setting the characters' faces in a monochromatic style while playing Ennio's main theme song for the movie was great. Perhaps this movie is under rated because Westerns haven't enjoyed the same prestige as other genres. It is true that most Westerns are usually drawn out, but Leone is able to keep with that sluggish pace and long running time, while keeping the audience excited and anxious for more. This movie is more than the greatest Western of all time, it is THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!! 'If only I had time to tell you.'",
1192,19 January 2016,sspina95,10, masterpiece,"the good, the bad and the ugly is a film directed in 1966 by Sergio Leone. the film belongs to the spaghetti wester current, a current that inspired a lot of director of today. the film has renewed the icon of the hero, in fact Clint Eastwood in not interested in justice or peace, but he acts only for money compensation. the film starts with a introduction of the main protagonists, and the story became more intricate because all of the protagonists want a treasure but only the blonde know it position. the title is very important because it's like a parody, in fact the good (blonde) isn't very good but he's similar to the other people of the film. the good, the bad and the ugly in the third film of the dollar trilogy composed by ""for a fistful of dollars"" and ""for a few dollars more""",
1193,25 June 2013,Gonzalez-KimCC,9, Classic Spaghetti Western!,"This movie was the first of three masterpieces by the great Italian director Sergio Leone and the last of a trilogy of westerns which he made with Clint Eastwood, this marked a significant step-forward on the two previous films on which they had collaborated, (""A Fistfull of Dollars"" and ""For a Few Dollars More""). The 'Once upon a time ...' movies would see Leone's films take on a much darker turn but although there is quite a lot of violence and death on display here, this is an almost jovial epic, (the humour comes from Leone's subversion of traditional western clich√©s). Almost every sequence feels, and looks, like a classic, (the climatic gunfight has the choreographed precision of a ballet), Tonino Delli Colli's widescreen cinematography is magnificent, and although dubbed, (very effectively), the English translation of the Italian script is first-class.",

Let me tell you this is an absolute classic. This movie got me hooked into watching a series of Spaghetti Westerns. All three actors are a almost made for their respective roles, and their dialogues can be repeated in other movie but never have the same effect as they did in this movie. It was surprising for me to see the level of patience I had to to watch this long movie because there were moments where i know i would have stopped watching it. But this movie always made sure they kept the viewers interesting. Even in the last scene the director's idea of the last show down was brilliant! It kept me on my toes.",

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is on top of my very best film list, even knowing that ""Terminator 2 : Judgement Day"" was my favorite film for at least 4 years. The actors, the history, the last duel..... words for what? This movie is a must, even people whom aren't western fans, will love this movie for sure. After this movie, I started to collect old movies, specially Clint Eastwood's old movies, like ""For a few dollars more"" , ""Fistfull of dollars"" , ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" .... and I may mention the '92 ""Unforgiven"" as well.",
1196,9 July 2016,samkeogh86,9," Masterful, immersive, and showing off all that is cool about a western with a bit of Eastwood swagger.","This classic western Film by legendary director Sergio Leone remains to this day as one of the greatest westerns of all time. the characters, story and filming itself still to this day hold up against modern film making and storytelling and considering this was made in the mid 60's that is quite a feat, with special effects not quite coming into their own yet. The film is the third and final installment to the Leone spaghetti western trilogy with the star of each film in Clint Eastwood, the famed outlaw of no name. in this film he takes on the character of Blondie, ""the Good"", working with Eli Wallach's Character Tuco, ""the Ugly"", until of course the partnership they hold falls apart when Tuco a wanted outlaw reaches the peak of his value to Blondie, a partnership of money grabs from sheriffs of different towns by pretending to hand in Tuco to the authorities to be hung before Blondie after receiving the reward sets Tuco free at the hangers rope. Finally there is the character of Lee Van Cleef, ""the Bad"" who is a cruel sadistic bounty hunter, a killer in every respect whose tag line is ""when I'm paid I see the job through"". These men all come together in the pursuit of hidden gold, when soldiers fighting the civil war, tell Tuco and Blondie of a cemetery with $200,000 of hidden Gold, they again form a begrudging alliance after Tuco has tried to Kill Blondie. Meanwhile Angel Eyes, ""the Bad"" is searching his confederate connections where he learns of the hidden gold, and in-turn intercepts Tuco and Blondie as a Yankee in disguise in a prison camp where Tuco and Blondie have been taken, when they dress in Confederate army uniform and are captured. This then brings us to Angel eyes forming somewhat of an alliance with Blondie after he frees him of his capture in the prison camp after he sends Tuco to be killed. Yet again however , alliances fail with Tuco escaping his Yankee captor and Blondie staying defensive of Angel Eyes, fully aware of his dangerous potential. Tuco meets up gain with Blondie in a small town where they together kill angel eyes's men, with Angel eyes escaping and the pair making off together in pursuit of the gold. before they reach the cemetery the final hurdle for the Good and the Ugly comes with them running into the heart of the civil war, the bridge over the river is the final obstacle with fierce fighting taking place in order to protect it, so Blondie and Tuco go forth and destroy it after they agree to tell each other's part of the secret, which cemetery and which grave, yet once across the river Tuco makes a break for it, but the composed Blondie with Classic Eastwood cool again meets up with Tuco at the supposed grave site, where too Angel eyes again appears making for an epic showdown in the centre of the cemetery over discovering the name of the grave, with Blondie being the only one with actual knowledge of said grave. The epic showdown accompanied with the epic score of Ennino Moriconne to back it up like was done throughout the film, see's angel eyes taken down by the quick drawing Blondie and Tuco again beaten by Blondie who emptied Tuco's gun barrel the night before, allowing for Blondie to be the one with all the advantage. the final scene is where Blondie with gold on horseback with Tuco strung up in a tree like he did to Blondie, Blondie like he always has done shoots the rope freeing Tuco for the last time to have his share of the money and to have Blondie ride off into the distance unbeaten and victorious. The 3hr long epic is to this day one of the best ever films and one of if not the best western ever made, it was made in the golden era of westerns which extended into the 70's with other classics many of which starred Eastwood himself. The actors, the writing, the filming and the music all make for the most unforgettable western ever made and like i said, despite its age, and the quality of film at the time, everything about this film all the way down to the sets and costumes is accurate to the time portrayed in the film and holds up against modern films and indeed modern westerns. after watching the film many times over it is fair to say they simply don't make movies like this anymore, movies with character, movies that are in so many ways imaginative and inventive in style and structure, the acting and scenarios never seem forced the actors never seem insincere and the tone of the film is entirely engaging throughout the film. the greatest scene of course is the final shootout, but like most westerns it is the proper conclusion of the film, though you may think it typical, i guarantee the final scene is anything but typical, it is dramatic it is tense and the music that carry's it completely immerses you into the fear and focus of the characters and I personally believe that few other westerns achieve such an intense and engaging finale and indeed an intense and engaging film throughout.",
1197,27 March 2005,SalvadorDali_666,10, The art of a western,"The trilogy of movies the Mr.Leone gave us, changed the way we will forever look at a western. Before his time John Wayne would ride on his horse and save the day and then ride off into the sunset, and once again it would just be our typical Cowboy hero movie with an occasion white man playing an Indian. But then one day Sergio Leone wanted us to get off our high horse and look at how corrupt the west real could be, give us the sense that our heroes in this world are by no means perfect in any way; in other words I honestly believe that until Leone's movies, we didn't get a real good artist in depth look at the WILD West. He made the hero of his three movies rough, tough, corrupt, deadly, and by no means innocent. The only thing that separated him from a bad guy was his heart. He basically didn't like anyone that was worse of a man than him, which you must admire. The sad thing is that until these movies, all of our heroes were clean cut, nice, do-gooders, always around to save the day and get the girls. Client Eastwood was the first western good guy to even have a beard, and thats just crazy... These three movies are to me are the most realistic interpretation of the Wild West the we have ever gotten. From the directors realistic views, to the realistic acting. These movies have even given artistic inspiration to the great directors of today, like Robert Rodriguez and Quinten Tarantino, so there is much to be thankful to there. Bottom line is that this trilogy has revolutionized directing, acting, and the way we will forever look at the Wild West.",

This includes not only in the trilogy itself, but also every Western I've seen thus far. Both a commentary on war and an adventure story, The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is about a hit-man called ""Angel Eyes""(Lee Van Cleef), a bandit named Tuco(Eli Wallach), and the Man With No Name(Clint Eastwood), who go to find gold hidden by a soldier during the American Civil War. The movie has some of the best directing I've seen in a movie and has some great music to go along with it.",
1201,4 February 2015,shanecaseya,10, typical spaghetti Western,"The movie ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" was written By Incrocci Agenore, Furio Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni. Sergio Leone directed the western. The film is set in the south western desert area of the United States during the civil war. There are three characters all of which are outlaws but some are at times much more brutal and violent than the others. Frist there is Blondie (Clint Eastwood) the There is Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleff) and Finally Pablo (Eli Wallach). In an abstract way this is a classic story of good versus evil, but as all three are outlaws and bandits at times it is hard to tell who is good, bad or ugly. This trio fight and taunt each other across the war torn south west in search of buried union gold. During this quest they stack bodies everywhere. Until the final show down and yes you guessed it Blondie wins and kill Angel Eyes and holds Pablo at gun point and makes him dig the gold up for him. Then he rides off into the sunset as it were. It seems that this is a western explanation of yin and yang as in this movie nothing is 100% bad or 100% good. It seems that most of Eastwood's movies follow this path. I found strong story ties between this movie and ""A fist Full of Dollars"". A scene that stands out as a picture of good versus evil and the yin and yang theme is at one point Blondie and Pablo wonder on to a battle field and talk to a union captain and then watch a battle where the killing is no stop. During a lull in the fight these two, who could have went around the battle sneak onto it and blow a bridge so that the two sides cannot get to each other to fight.",

The camera-work, the direction and the descriptions of the three main characters is just remarkable.

Eastwood is such a PIMP in this movie. I loved the format and I love the theme. Best theme in movie history in my opinion as well. It is by far my favorite movie right next to Shawshank Redemption. It is a tad lengthy but worth it. The mix of western, action, adventure, and even a little comedy mixed in is fabulous! The revamped version on DVD (in color) is wonderful. The way that the movie is put together in general is wonderful. The catch to the movie is simply spectacular. The cast is perfect. Clint Eastwood as ""The Good"" is perfect. His changing relationship with Tuco (The Ugly) throughout the entire movie is well thought out and can be quite humorous at times. And ""The Bad"" is your prototypical bad guy. He'll do anything to get the money...as will everyone else in the movie. Hands-down awesome movie. 10/10",

And on more most important thing I'd like to add is that the characters in the movies are the epitome of so called GOOD, BAD AND THE UGLY. And in this epic the good, bad and ugly side of human life is perfectly depicted without and err. And there are certainly some dialogues from the movie that would intrigue you while enjoying the movie. And one of them I'd like to share in order to grasp you a better understand of the context in which I'm talking about. The dialogue of the ugly guy- ""There are two type of man in this world....""

In a film that runs 180 minutes in its current restored version, that is not enough plot, but Leone has no shortage of other ideas. There is the opening shootout, involving unrelated characters. There is the con game in which Wallach plays a wanted man, Eastwood turns him in for the reward, and then Eastwood waits until he is about to be hanged and severs the rope with a well-aimed shot. There is the magnificent desert sequence, after Eastwood abandons Wallach in the desert, and then Wallach does the same to Eastwood, and the sun burns down like a scene from ""Greed.""

Ever since I first watched it, Mr. Wallach has made an impression on me. I absolutely love his acting and his character is oddly fun to watch. The three actors really make the movie. It is an honor still to see Wallach acting. His performance in an E.R. episode and his theatrical background show his true ability to be flexible and his talents are first rate. What an honor to be even able to talk to him once! His characters are always memorable. His expressions in this film go beyond what seems to be a minimum called for by that day's directors. With a score by the famous Ennio Morricone, supporting actors that have a real-life grittiness to them, really compliment one another. His best role is this one of ""Tuco"" as he really gets carried away. I HIGHLY recommend this must-see movie for it's raw performances and breathtaking landscape, epic shots. This, as well, compliments the pauses of thought as well as the never-ending feel to this one of a three part trilogy. Also recommend ""Aces High.""

1215,5 September 2018,jaftc,10, A Masterclass in Filmmaking,"My favorite movie of all time is The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. 
Most critics and audiences tend to agree that this movie is exceptional. It's had a continued impact on the way films are made. And even over 50 years after its release, it has been able to entertain and influence a Gen-Z kid like me.
What makes this amazing? There are so many things. I love treasure hunting, I love westerns, and I love the civil war, and the plot manages to seamlessly create a perfect story. The three titular characters are all interesting and beg for your attention from beginning to end. Blondie is a mysterious hero with a cowboy's charisma. He's just so cool that you have to root for him. Tuco delivers comic relief perfectly and his constant change of allegiance keeps me guessing. And finally, Angel Eyes is an impeccable antagonist; a dark, enigmatic hitman who's willing to do anything to get his prize. The three are portrayed perfectly by Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef. These are all dynamite performances, and it behooves any actor to study them. 
The gritty and violent western vibe is heightened in intensity by the backdrop of the civil war, giving it historical significance and a great background for the main characters to interact with. 
And let's not forget the music. This movie also has my favorite film score of all time. Ennio Morricone delivers impeccable music. It's soft and reflective when it needs to be, and it's epic and dramatic when the action builds up.
Overall, I could go on and on about why The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly takes the crown for my favorite movie, but I think the movie speaks for itself. When I first saw it in 2014, I was struck. I was in awe. I was completely satisfied. There's absolutely no problem with it that I can name.
There are a lot of great westerns, but Sergio Leone's masterpiece stands out because it uses so many interesting elements, and converts them into a realistic and impeccable story that I could never forget. A remarkable achievement in film history and art history, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is rightfully my favorite movie of all time.",

From the ever-punned soundtrack to the over-quoted quotes this movie is one of the classics that will open your eyes to the redone, over processed, plagiarized drivel that steals $10 from your pocket every visit to the local cinema.

When will another movie of this caliber come to the big screen. I know that Clint Eastwood directed ""Unforgiven,"" and did a good job, but it wasn't as believable as ""Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo"" Maybe it was the age of the film itself, the dustiness, the yellowish hues, the darkness of camera.
