1,19 May 2015,Horst_In_Translation,10," Masterpiece, a unique lesson on humanity","This is the first full feature film by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck and won him a Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award as well as an uncountable number of other awards all around the world. The film runs for roughly 2 hours and 15 minutes and does not drag a single second. The reason for this is FHvD's outstanding script and a cast that delivers 100% from minute 1, also including all the actors in smaller roles such as Thomas Thieme, who gives a great performance of an influential figure not scared of using his political power to his own sexual advantage. The standout is Ulrich Mühe showing us his character's transformation from a ruthless Stasi (secret police) agent into a caring human being who puts his own freedom at risk in order to oppose a political system built on fear that is as rotten as it gets and protect the people suffering from it. Merely from the political perspective, in my opinion, this is a movie that everybody needs to see, especially those with an interest in history. And even for those who are not particularly fond of political films, this is highly recommended as the characters and their interaction are written and portrayed with such wit and accuracy that I am not shy of calling it the best German movie ever made. And I have seen lots.",r
2,26 March 2007,Red-125,10, We all have something to hide.,Das Leben der Anderen (2006) (The Lives of Others) was brilliantly written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. The film is a taut thriller. It's also a dramatization of what happened in East Germany--and could happen here--if we allow the government access to every aspect of our lives. Ulrich Mühe stars as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler of the Stasi--the dreaded secret police. The Captain is so talented in interrogation that he gives lectures on interrogation techniques to Stasi cadets.,e

4,20 May 2006,hareck,10, Excellent,"I do agree with all the other positive comments, and just need to add that this is the very first movie about the former GDR I saw that is not something like a comedy. Flicks like ""Sonnenallee"" or ""Good bye Lenin"" definitely were great and funny, but unconsciously left myself (a West German) with the impression that the GDR has been a sort of ""Mickey Mouse State"" full of stupid but charming characters, not really to be taken seriously. After seeing ""Das Leben der Anderen"" this impression shifted quite a bit: there actually was suffering, killing desperation and a terribly claustrophobic atmosphere behind that wall. This might well be the most realistic depiction of the dark side of the former East Germany. Thanks to the Producers, actors and director for making this movie. 10 out of 10.",i

7,9 March 2007,johno-21,10, Sonata for a Good Man,"This film is set in the Orlwellian year of 1984 in the old German Democratic Republic of what was known as East Berlin. The Stasi are the ""Shield and the Sword"" of the ruling party of this soviet bloc nation, a secret police force of 100,000 that subjugates another 300,000 to spy for them. This totalitarian system is based on a need to know everything about the countries populace of 16 million. Everything is meticulously documented. Big Brother keeps tabs on any it deems worthy of investigation. Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is a button-down bureaucratic establishmentarian who works as a Stasi interrogator and as an instructor in the school for Stasi. His old schoolmate Lt. Col Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) is now his immediate superior. In an attempt to further his career, Grubitz wants to impress Cultural Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) and orders Wiesler to set up an elaborate eavesdropping stakeout to gather information on playwright George Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). Dreyman is a playwright loyal to the party but most his contemporaries have not been including his favorite director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Leinert) who has been blacklisted. Dreyman's live-in girlfriend is the popular stage actress Christina- Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) who is also the object of amorous affection from the sinister, shades of gestapo-like Hemph. This is no ordinary spy thriller. Writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck in his feature film debut gives the screen this wonderfully compelling story of life behind the Iron Curtain in the years leading to the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall and continues into 1991 after the reunification of Germany. Wonderful camera work from cinematographer Hagen Bogdanski enhances the stark realism of this film. This is the Academy Award winning Best Foreign Language Film of 2006. I had to see this since it beat out the highly favored Pan's Labyrinth for the Oscar. It's evident to me that Lives of Others is the superior film and the Academy got it right. This film flows so smoothly and your eyes are constantly on every movement on the screen that it's hard to believe you are reading subtitles too. Gabriel Yared's original composition for the film ""Sonata for a Good Man"" is a pivotal piece of it's storyline. I can't help but give this film my highest rating of a 10 out of 10 and I would highly recommend it.",/
8,14 January 2016,bkrauser-81-311064,10," A Quiet, Meticulous, Well-Made Thriller","In the very first minutes of The Lives of Others, the unassuming Captain Gerd Wiesler (Muhe) sits in a small office interrogating a prisoner of the East German Stasi. He records his progress on tape and within hours Wiesler exhausts his prisoner to the point of confession, The tape stops; Wiesler is in a classroom teaching pupils at the university how to do the same. Within those first minutes we get a strong impression of his character; calculated, reserved and above all meticulous. It's those traits along with his dedication to Communism that make him a perfect surveillance man, at least according to Grubitz (Tukur) his supervisor.",r
9,22 February 2016,Hitchcoc,10, Think Twice Before You Hand Over Too Much to Government,"The Cold War is the center of all this. We were guilty of allowing the division of Germany and the splitting of the city of Berlin. What transpired was a Soviet controlled city with as many informants as citizens (exaggeration, but not that great a one). Of course, the true journalist is going to be the first to go. Don't say anything against the government. The focuses of this film is a young author who has to keep a low profile, and a man who lives right next to him, whose job is to use heavy surveillance on him. Eventually, this man begins to realize the results of his actions and he tries to pull back his invasiveness. The scariest part of this film involves the tactics used to get confessions out of those singled out. Of course, when they can't get to the person, they threaten their wives and children. Of course, since this takes place in 1980, we are in the wake of the destruction of the Berlin Wall. Everyone should see this and think about its implications. There is alo a subtlety and a reserved presentation that makes this work well.",w

I've seen everything---60 films. This was one of the last 3 films that I saw---because I was completely unfamiliar with the title. This film slowly gripped me, but by the end, the grip was merciless. The lead actor, who should be doing The Life Story Of Peter Jennings, was wonderful. Everybody was terrific. Congratulations to the writers for their perfect structure---and to the director for his flawless storytelling---and his eliciting of top performances from his actors. How well cast it was. ",0

The Minister of Culture Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) and former lover of Christa orders the ambitious Chief of Police Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) to find evidences that Georg is not loyal to the party to get rid off him and stay with Christa, and the efficient agent Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is assigned to conduct surveillance on Georg's apartment. Wiesler does not find any evidence that could compromise Georg, until the day of his blacklisted friend and director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert) commits suicide.

15,17 May 2007,sissoed,9," Excellent film, insightful character studies","This film, set in the theater world of the mid-1980s, was particularly satisfying to me because I was a producer of avant-garde theater through the 1980s, based in San Francisco but often on tour -- including to international theater festivals in West Germany, communist Poland and communist Yugoslavia in 1987. Although my experience as an American was of course very different than the experience of these East Berliners, there is a mood and sense of personalities in this film that I found authentic and familiar. The people in this film feel like the people I met in the festival bars and refreshment centers for participating artists and on panel discussions in those festivals. ",4
16,17 April 2007,Cloudmeister,9, Every positive word written about this movie is absolutely true,"I am still quite speechless. Overwhelmed by how utterly compelling the story was and by how emotive the acting story was. Floored by the unbelievably great character development. This film is close to perfect. It is a spiritual cousin to 2004's magnificent Downfall and shares a lot of similarities with Paul Verhoeven's stunning Black Book from last year, not just because these films share two actors. This multi-faceted character driven masterpiece really is as good as it's hype says.",3
17,19 October 2006,rkj-3,10, Brilliant movie,"Germany has produced some very good movies recently ... but this one is in a class of its own. The main power of a quality movie, for me, has always been two things, a good story and mood - and this film has both. The story keeps you interested through all 139 minutes. You actually feel yourself transported to the 1980s of the former German republic. They have carefully chosen locations that looks east-germanish ... lots of ""Trabant"" cars on the streets :-) and the general grayish mood is very well recreated. The ordinary peoples fear of the Stasi is realistically portrayed. And i just love the twist in the story in the last 20 minutes or so. A brilliant movie that anyone even remotely interested in non-mainstream movies should see.",/

Full disclosure: I'm a German born (Munich born) German-American who left Germany in 1986, before the wall came down. I cannot describe the feeling I felt as the last few words were spoken on the screen. I could not look at the subtitles ( a habit of speaking two languages ) because my eyes were so full of tears. I cannot tell you how I was so sorry I did not experience the wall coming down. This film healed a wound that may have been left by the nightmare years of 1938-1945, my own great uncle being a Nazi war criminal, convicted in Nuremberg in 1946. Yes, we are mensch too. We have the potential for greatness (of character) in spite of our history. Thank you Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, for giving me back half of my lost soul in this single ""es ist für mich"". I am reminded again that the difference between ourselves and beasts is that we have a choice.",?
19,24 September 2007,Galina_movie_fan,10," 1984, East Germany - Shield and Sword of the Party know everything","""The Lives of Others"", the 2007 very deserving Oscar winner for the Best Foreign Film is IMO, the best film of last year regardless of the country it was made in. It took its writer/director several years first to thoroughly research still very painful events of the recent German history, the ones that deal with infamous and evil STASI (State Secret Police) and how it infiltrated and affected almost every aspect of GDR life. Before the collapse of the Soviet system and its most ominous and infamous symbol, the wall in the end of the 80s, life in East Germany of 1984 had imitated art precisely like in the prophetic and terrifying George Orwell's novel. Each citizen could have and majority were closely monitored by STASI which motto was ""Shield and Sword of the Party"" and its goal, ""To know everything"". By the time East Germany collapsed in 1989, STASI employed an estimated 91,000 employees and 300,000 informants; about one in fifty East Germans collaborated with the powerful and Omni-present Secret Police, one of the most extensive infiltrations of a police apparatus in history. The STASI monitored political behavior among GDR citizens, and is known to have used torture and intimidation to mute, corrupt, and destroy dissent. Even those who believed they were above suspicion due to their closeness to the prominent members of the government were not safe. The film explores the lives of those who watched and listened and those on the other side of the wire.",r

Of course it never made it to a cinema near me and so when it came up in the TV listings it became a 'must see' for me. I'm really glad I saw it, it's somewhat different to what I was expecting (in a good way). I know there are a few out there that are afraid of subtitles, so I should tell you that yes, it's in German with subtitles. For me, this isn't a problem, but with a long film (as this is), I find I sometimes have to take a break to rest the brain for a few minutes. I found it to be a really engaging drama that has some truly powerful scenes and some great performances. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.",_

33,10 February 2007,Chris Knipp,9, Beautifully restrained study of moral complexity and totalitarianism,"The Lives of Others/Das Leben der Anderenthe title of this striking German film points to the vicariousness of a world dominated by suspicion and surveillance. In East Germany before the Berlin Wall came down the STASI, the state police, wanted to watch everyone. In 1984 a file is opened and STASI men are set to work watching a man and a woman who are above reproach. In the paranoid world of the eastern zone, innocence itself, as in Kafka, is suspicious. In charge of the case, code name ""Laszlo,"" is a certain Weisler (Ulrich Mühe). And those thoroughly bugged and listened to day and night are Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a noted playwright, friend of the Chancellor, politically correct in the eyes of the regime, and his beloved girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), a famous actress. Behind this particular project are political higher-ups, sly and manipulative, jealous of each other's positions, kingpins of a system that in a few years will toss them out. This is a paranoid 1984 not far from the one Orwell imagined. When Weisler's men bug Dreyman's flat, the lady across the hall sees them. Weisler tells her if she speaks a word to anybody, her daughter will be thrown out of the university. One of the officials wants Christa-Maria. Now that she is vulnerable, on the examination table, so to speak, he can move in on her. It's only a matter of time before somebody will be begging for mercy.",

39,23 August 2014,classicsoncall,9," ""If you don't take a stand, you're not human.""","Set in 1984 East Berlin, ""The Lives of Others"" focuses on a man, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe), who undergoes a gradual transformation that ultimately ends in tragedy for the 'enemies of socialism' he originally sets out to investigate. That transformation occurs painstakingly over time and with no single event to make him change his mind. Instead, Weisler gains a gradual understanding of human beings who value artistic creativity and freedom along with an insight into what makes them tick. The story takes a remarkable turn when the investigator becomes part of the investigation, and is exiled to a proletarian job within the bureaucracy of the Stasi controlled government. Filmed less than a decade ago, the ironies consistent with present day surveillance techniques of the NSA, Google-mapping, and insidious tracking of every keystroke (including these) are a chilling prophecy of mind and thought control unimaginable even in ""1984"".",

As a great cinema-goer and a genuine admirer of the European cinematography, I was overwhelmed with a notion that a succession of thought-provoking German films would be continued with this moving insight into the lives of others at a very delicate period of the 80s in East Germany.

The introduction of the characters Dreyman and Sieland is also nice, especially if, like me, you watch the movie without any prior knowledge toward this movie. The transition that Wiesler undergoes during the movie is portrayed nicely. This is even better because the movie uses less scene montages. The depiction of Grubitz's dangerous character through bits and pieces scattered along this movie is also nice.

The Stasi are everywhere, watching everyone and punishing in brutal or subtle ways anyone who might be even an implied threat to the government. Their greatest tool is the system of informers that reaches everywhere, people who may relay indiscretions to the Stasi because they believe in what they are doing, but more often are compromised into doing so. People are given terrible choices to either work with the Stasi as informers or see their careers or their children's futures destroyed.

49,4 May 2007,Asa_Nisi_Masa2,9," ""Sonate vom guten Menschen"" also made this reviewer dewy-eyed!","A deserving Oscar winner if ever there was one, though I was never one to pay special attention to the Oscars, I was almost shocked by how perfect this debut movie by a 34-year-old director very nearly was. Set in East Berlin in the mid-80s, some five years before the infamous Wall crumbled, it follows the STASI as they plot to find incriminating evidence against playwright Georg Dreyman, who'd been the regime's darling until a ruthless minister frivolously develops a lecherous desire to possess his girlfriend, renowned stage actress Christa-Maria Sieland. Though both Sebastian Koch (last seen by me as the Nazi Captain Müntze in Verhoeven's Black Book) and Martina Gedeck are excellent as the central couple trapped within the STASI's web of eavesdropping and paranoia tactics, the real hero and star of the movie is without a doubt Ulrich Mühe. I had last seen in Michael Haneke's Funny Games, where he played Georg, the unfortunate husband and dad who comes to a sticky end. In The Lives of Others, Mühe memorably fills the shoes of the STASI agent Gerd Wiesler who listened to Dreyman's daily life through the bugs in his flat. Balding, physically non-descript Wiesler conveys more with one subtle shift of an eyeball than the whole stellar cast of an Oliver Stone movie. This actor is so charismatic, he blows even the undeniably talented and handsome Sebastian Koch clear off the screen.

A man working for such an organization can be A GOOD MAN (moral,compassionate,human,unbiased,tolerant....) ? How many of them they had a conscience ? It is hard to say that agent (whatever his codename was) is torn by guilt , conscience or simply love for beautiful actress . Who knows ? For me that is an enigma . More people who voted positively for this movie are from eastern Europe ; is normal they witnessed those events (as myself) you can forget those times , with bad things , good things filtered of course by personal opinion and personal experience . I did not know then the time flew , I was enthralled , enchanted , even if I kind of had guessed some things they gonna end up bad . A very moving and humane movie !",

52,5 December 2009,yris2002,9, Terrific screenplay and solid performances for a powerfully gripping drama,"It is the second time I have seen this movie. When I first saw it I remember feeling upset by the idea that just a little more than 20 years ago, in the heart of a civilized and enlightened Europe, there dominated such cultural repression and such terroristic means of questioning. Not that history of the former DDR was unknown to me, but probably because undeveloped at school, or probably because a little disregarded also by cinematography, it was rather upsetting. On a second watching, having assimilated the strong impact of the first one, I could better analyze the quality of the movie from a cinematographic point of view, and really appreciate it. It has a solid structure which makes every shot perfectly match with the whole, and contributes to an overall clear, lucid and perfectly built drama. The story proceeds with a quick pace, each scene is the preparation for the next one, everything is under control and follows a well marked and gripping path. The cast is simply outstanding: the actress playing Christa Maria is truly convincing in showing her deep inner laceration between her love for the stage and her love for Georg, the handsome and attractive dramatist, who knows where the right side lies, but finds it hard to assert it explicitly. But who leaves the most emotionally powerful mark is Ulrich Muhe interpreting Wiesler: he stirs thought and emotion, he is so dramatically contained, as his character requires, but, in a single hint at a smile (whe he reads Brecht's poems), conveys such a desperate yearning for true life, I think an Oscar deserving interpretation. In the end, a movie I would absolutely advise: it is intelligently thought-provoking, intellectually honest, and solidly built: a high-level piece of cinema. Really worth seeing.",

I wonder why we say that? Is there something magical about privacy? Something that lets the spirit free? Our story starts before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Stasi, East Germany's Secret Police, has refined its way of dealing with artists. No violence. Psychology. Persuasion. Surveillance. The lives of others are not their own. Most artists give up. Many commit suicide. Your best friend. Your lover. Georg Dreyman is lucky. He survives.",
54,3 July 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, The watchers and the observed,"This is a spell-binding film. Absolutely captivating. Before the Berlin Wall fell, Stasi conducted surveillance on anyone they suspected of harboring thoughts and opinions against the Communist rule of Eastern Germany. We follow a man employed by the DDR to listen in on a specific household, and how he gradually becomes emotionally attached to these two people that he, unbeknownst to them, is recording the actions of. This gives a psychological and realistic look at not only the people who are the subject of a constant invasion of privacy, but also those who are responsible for it. There is tremendous authenticity, in this. It is dramatic, engaging, suspenseful, and, frankly, beautiful. The plot is excellent, and develops rather well. This has spot-on pacing, and it's never boring. The acting is beyond reproach, every single performance in this is stunning. All of the music and score fits. The writing is incredible, the credibility, the characters, the dialog, the scenes... I could go on. Since I only followed what was said from the subtitles, I cannot comment on whether or not there is harsh language in this. There is sexuality and nudity, and I would say that a certain maturity level is necessary to appreciate this anyway. The DVD holds a trailer, some previews for other movies, a showcase of the actual equipment used and several interviews, all of them worth the time. I recommend this to anyone who has a chance to see it. 10/10",

It is a tense yet balanced work by newcomer writer and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who manages to present a tense story of espionage, suspense, intrigue, and political danger without the need for car chases, explosions, gunfire, or any of the usual accoutrements that pulse through other stories of this nature. Instead von Donnersmarck shows us the interior lives of his characters, both those working with the East German government and Secret Police and those who struggled to survive individuality. One of the primary jobs of the Secret Police (Stasi) was to spy on informers and those who would leak information about East Germany to the West. One fact that was kept under lock and key was the high rate of suicide, especially among artists who could not bear the crushing eye of the Eastern police, that would be devastating information if leaked into the press of the West: this forms the nidus for the story of this film.",

64,13 November 2012,toqtaqiya2,9, An interesting character study with excellent performances.,"West German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck crafted an engaging drama in The Lives Of Others, his first feature film. At the center of this film is the impressive performance by Ulrich Muhe as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, an officer of the Stasi. Wiesler is an efficient and loyal employee who goes through changes he didn't expect. After listening in on Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) and Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), two fine artists whose lifestyle is different from his he begins to doubt his work. In addition to the excellent performances from the cast and Donnersmarck's effective direction the film is aided by Hagen Bogdanski's expert cinematography. Some reviewers stressed the feeling of paranoia in The Lives Of Others but my opinion is that instead the film amplifies the relationships that all people have every day. By picking these characters Donnersmarck stresses humanity. This approach leads to a satisfying emotional ending. While The Lives Of Others is a very good piece of filmmaking it's certainly not a history lesson. The German Democratic Republic was perhaps the state with the most surveillance in the Eastern Bloc but even there there were only a few Wieslers and personal or even erotic motifs played a somewhat subordinate role in the musty atmosphere of East German socialism. The film is not an accurate presentation of life in the Eastern Bloc, and it was intentionally made to look gray. Another factor is the film's Best Picture win at the 2006 Academy Awards, which by the way is a tentacle of American propaganda. The film that should have won was Pan's Labyrinth, but instead The Lives Of Others was picked for ideological reasons. Despite these obvious flaws and problems The Lives Of Others is still one of the best German films of recent years, and internationally it grossed an impressive $77 million.",

66,12 August 2009,gurkpeter,7, Valid story from the Communist era,"The story presents an era of total surveillance where anything not in line with the will of the party leaders is punished. Arguments do not exist, just the use of power. I think the story is valid. However it only reflects how people from the West can imagine, interpret and understand life in East Germany. During watching this film I had ambivalent feelings. Ulrich Mühe's performance really gives an authentic example of a Stasi officer and gives us a real feeling what the totalitarian system means. However I think the film lacks authenticity in some sense. Only those feel this subtle lack who have lived in an Easter European country. As a verification I guessed which actor has grown up in East Germany and which not. Then I checked their biographies that 90% confirmed my guesses. Those who have not grown up in East Germany only act. Those who lived in the totalitarian system really give us the authenticity. In summary, I think this is a very good film and the only I know of that exposes the surveillance of totalitarian systems. The performance of Ulrich Mühe as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler alone make this film worth seeing. For those who might be interested in the topic I recommend reading the book Celestial Harmonies: A Novel from Péter Esterházy and its second part (Celestial Harmonies: A Novel (P.S.)).

69,20 October 2007,bandw,10, Outstanding,"Artists are dangerous to dictatorships as this film so ably proves. A work of art, such as this film about life in the GDR, has the power to influence opinion in a way that history books cannot. In the interview with director Donnersmarck on the DVD extras he mentions that he spent a year and a half doing research for this. He read everything he could on the GDR and conducted extensive interviews with former GDR people, including ex-Stasi agents. Many of the actors are East Germans including Ulrich Mühe who was himself under surveillance by the Stasi. All of this reflects Donnersmark's stated desire for authenticity, down to using original surveillance equipment and filming some of the final scenes in the actual Stasi archives. In any case, if we were to abstract this story from any basis in reality and view it as fiction, it is still powerful. By concentrating on a few individuals it presents a chilling view of the effects of living in a repressive dictatorship. I found this movie to have a keener effect on me than Wells' ""1984.""",

Basically it is 1984, where in East Germany, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (BAFTA nominated Ulrich Mühe) is a skilled interrogator assigned by his superior Lt. Col. Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) to bug the house of playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his long term partner, actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). At first Grubitz disagrees that Georg is worth ""watching"", well, there are things that should be heard, but he still agrees to go along with it. It turns out though that Grubitz, forced at first to listen to them, becomes fascinated by the conversations of Georg and Christa-Maria, he doesn't want to be substituted. Soon though Georg becomes even more interesting when it turns out there is a reason to be listening, but Grubitz is the only one hearing it, so he is writing false information on the audio surveillance log, and checking it out himself. It becomes really intense when Georg does something really big, and Christa-Maria has to be interrogated by Grubitz, and soon after commits suicide for betrayal. In the end, Georg finds out about the surveillance ripping all the wires, and he finds Grubitz's logs, and in appreciation, his recent playwright work gets a thank you message written to Grubitz, which he of course buys. Also starring Thomas Thieme as Minister Bruno Hempf, Hans-Uwe Bauer as Paul Hauser, Volkmar Kleinert as Albert Jerska, Matthias Brenner as Karl Wallner, Charly Hübner as Udo and Herbert Knaup as Gregor Hessenstein. I will say I really wish that Pan's Labyrinth won the Oscar instead, but I can see some reasons why this film beat it, it is quite an engaging near comedic at times drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and it was nominated for Best Director for Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck, Best Film and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

This in my point of view is the real thread of the movie, moral choices. What's the right thing to do? To who we owe a good moral act? Can we be part of something that might be immoral and feel good about it? This movie is superb! The final line of the movie almost made me cry alone in my room.

Far from being a simple propaganda film, it is a subtle, powerful, brilliant, intelligent and pulled by a jaw dropping acting too, though the actors are known outside Germany. I am not surprised that it was so widely seen over the world. It is accurate and thrilling, scary and poignant in the same time. It is impossible to think about something else after watching this film. Another movie, however, was also a pure masterpiece, but told on a lighter way: GOOD BYE LENIN, speaking of a cousin subject, related to the East West Germany problem, but told from another angle.",

We all have our agendas, apolar from Gods' will. What a sad existence our characters found themselves in as East Germany was artistic quicksand.

I wish I could add something to the whole host of superlatives made by previous posters. This is a truly awesome film, at the very least a mini masterpiece and possibly even a fully-fledged one. With the best will in the world people in the West can never really KNOW what it was like to live in a state of constant long-distance supervision but this film - made by a native of West Germany who, by definition, has never known it either - comes as close as any to making us privy to that sensation. All the credits are impeccable from Writing, Directing down to the smallest 'extra' and it is wonderful to see Martina Gedeck, so great as Bella Martha, and Sebastian Koch, equally good in Black Book, once more but excellent as both are they are outshone by Ulrich Muhe as the Stasi official charged with monitoring their lives. Weighing in at a little over two hours and with no sex or violence to speak of the film nevertheless rivets the attention by - if not in spite of - the very grayness which informs it with Muhe, himself a victim of Stasi surveillance, outstanding as he mutates from automaton to human being but totally from WITHIN (no dramatic histrionics here to symbolize his volte-face, just acting of the most subtle kind).

The era of paranoia, suppression of free speech, and total state control of everything and everyone is masterfully displayed here in the intertwining stories of the Stasi police officer, his morally questionable superiors, and the actress and playwright they are spying on. Once again, the German people's love affair with authoritarianism and meticulously detailed records is featured here as the most intimate details of these people's lives are examined and we see the quiet tragedies of their everyday life stemming from their bizarrely married desires for freedom and attempts to rationalize their place and survive in the State and the Socialist movement.

Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe, giving the film's best performance) is assigned surveillance duties, and stakes himself out in the attic of Dreyman's apartment building, listening in on Dreyman's conversations and numerous intimacies. Dreyman is not a subversive, at least not in deed, until a beloved friend in the theatre commits suicide because of a ruined career brought about by the GDR officials. This loss compels Dreyman to action, and he writes a scathing indictment of the GDR which he publishes anonymously in a West German liberal magazine. Wiesler knows that Dreyman is the author, but has become so fascinated by Dreyman and his life, and so doubtful as to the moral motives of the GDR, that instead of turning Dreyman into the authorities, he becomes his secret accomplice.",

Das Leben der Anderen tells a story of a Stasi officer who is absolutely perfect at his job; he can crack anyone and he knows every bit of human psychology there is to know about to do the job well done, but the only person he wasn't able to have cracked turned out to be himself. There are a lot of things that we regret to have done but there are just as many that we regret we haven't and our whole life builds up on those deeds, right and wrong turns, and in the end all that's really left to ask yourself is if you can live with yourself despite everything you've done.

94,23 September 2007,EUyeshima,9," Suspenseful, Nuanced Character Study Puts a Spotlight on a Little Known Aspect of the Cold War","Five long years before the Berlin Wall fell, the Stasi, East Germany's secret police, was at the height of its infiltrative power with one in every fifty citizens cooperating with them in sniffing out any scent of political dissidence. To the Western world, it's a relatively unknown piece of Cold War history, but the Stasi's repressive force permeated all aspects of German society. First-time director and screenwriter Florian Henckel von Donnersmark makes a most auspicious debut with this mesmerizing, epic-length 2006 study of the Stasi's devastating impact on a trio of characters in pre-glasnost East Berlin.",

This is one of the best movies ever to be made! I guess the Academy think's that a Foreign Language movie can't be better than the American movie!

As a viewer, this is like unwrapping 2 surprise gifts in one package that complement one another. One being I enjoyed the re-creation of the later-aged communist bloc and two being the characters of government and society who inhabited them - most especially, the lead Stasi played by Ulrich Muhe , whose own character's growth and metamorphosis through the length of the film is emblematic of the plight of the state. Brilliantly done. We go from despising him to understanding and finally empathizing with him. Direction is first class and focused and the cast is determined and full of energy. This is truly an example of how good a movie can strive and it's awards and acclaim are highly merited.",

If I were to comment much on the story, it would become overly political so I restrain. The movie is political but it says more about conflict of conscious and redemption than it does about political beliefs. A powerful story of tragedy and triumph, of greed and grace, of love and deception. It is a story about the cost of sacrifice and the cost of compromise. ",
98,18 March 2007,jaredmobarak,8, The 40th Anniversary PlayThe Lives of Others,"Many people were startled by the fact that Pan's Labyrinth lost the Best Foreign Film Oscar to its fellow nominee The Lives of Others. Granted, many hadn't seen the German film yet, however, I think the push that the Spanish fantasy had, while also taking a few technical Oscars in the process, surprised a lot of people. The shock led to numerous movie folk on the internet describing the voting process for that award, how a select group, not the entire Academy, screens the foreign films. Therefore many thought that this more dramatic and adult story was chosen because that group was probably a very pretentious bunch and couldn't in their right mind vote a fantasy film as a winner above it. Whether this is true or not, Buffalo now has the opportunity to see the award winning film for itself, to decide if it was deserving or not. I must say, while I don't think it was better than Pan's I am totally fine with the fact that it won. The Lives of Others is an expertly told thriller, tense throughout, as we never quite know what our protagonist or antagonist will do, or even if they are on opposite sides of the movie's coin to begin with.",

As a matter of fact, when I first started watching this film, I was thinking that it wasn't going to be worth over two hours of my time. I soon discovered that it is worth far more. It turned out to be a deeply personal experience for me as it reminded me of certain shattering events in my own life. I actually had nightmares last night relating to those events which, I'm sure, were aroused by viewing this extraordinary film set in East Germany a few years before the fall of The Wall.",

Director von Donnersmarck engages us in the life of a cold, dispassionate character then takes us on a journey that transforms him from detached observer to involved partisan. The film is careful to avoid overt melodrama, but at the same time, it engages the emotions. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the movie is the complexity and intelligence evident in the screenplay. The unique angle of the film is in itself unusual, a thriller that follows the villains.

At the risk of oversimplifying things, plot-heavy movies tend to ignore character development, and character-study movies ignore a streamlined plot for the sake of a series of episodes.

A free-thinking but cautious playwright, Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), is targeted by the Stasi, the notorious East German secret police, because a powerful minister, Hempf (Thomas Thieme), wants to have the noted actress and Dreyman's live-in girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), available to him sexually whenever he wants. A Stasi officer, Gerd Wiesler, (Ulrich Muhe) is assigned by his superior, Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), the task of wiring Dreyman's apartment and collecting the necessary incriminating evidence. Interplay between Hempf, Grubitz, and Wiesler displays a menacing hierarchical relationship while Dreyman goes about his business believing he is free of suspicion. Meanwhile, Ms. Sieland is under direct pressure from oily Minister Hempf to surrender her body as the price of being allowed to perform her craft. Wiesler's growing sympathy for Ms. Sieland and for Dreyman seems highly improbable and the outcome is melodramatic -- but it is a movie, after all, and improbabilities and melodrama are coin of the realm. The writer and director, Florian Henckel von Donnenmarck, deserves all the honors he won for this film, including a best foreign film Oscar",

They don't believe his intentions. The East German government assigns Captin Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler to tap the wires of playwright Georg Dreyman and his lover Christa Marie Sieland's apartment. Wiesler is a pitiful character who has no life to begin with. He is the ideal Stasi, during a lecture his students at the beginning of the film we see cut aways to a brutal interrogation scene. This case is different for Wiesler though, for some reason he finds himself intrigued by Dreyman. He begins to wonder if he truly believes in Socialism. and when Dreyman writes a critical article dealing with East Germany's suicide epidemic, Wiesler leaves the traitorous news out of the report. He becomes entangled between the government and his morals.",

I was always fascinated by the irony that Soviet Russia reacted to the fall of the 3rd Reich with a socialist mask upon their fascist faces. This movie was a wonderfully intimate look at the grim reality of the Iron Curtain, and the humanity that simmered under the surface eventually leading to the wall collapse.

But are naive in thinking that their own little world will not change along with it. This is a must see. I believe it even beats out any Hollywood film contender this award season. This should have been placed in the best picture category even if its in a foreign language. Realistic and not melodramatic. Hope we see more films of this caliber. Truly exceptional!,

115,8 February 2008,luke-346,9, A highly masterful rendition of good old-fashioned human decency that is both compelling and thought provoking!,"Set mostly in the 1980s and during the cold war, Das Leben der Anderen tells of the world created by the Stasi (the internal army by which the Socialist Unity Party kept control of the German Democratic Republic, aka GDR) and how GDR citizens lived in a world of repression. A state security captain, Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhn), is an expert in interrogating dissidents and is assigned the case of spying on a playwright called Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). It is for this reason (of being a playwright) that he is put under surveillance. As Weisler's investigation progresses he becomes unwittingly aware of his own limited existence and empathy for those he watches ensues, taking precedence over his obedience and loyalty to the Stasi  so much so that he begins to falsify documents and lie about events in Dreyman's life. Regarding the films treatment of the Stasi, Das Leben der Anderen has caused controversy upon its release, especially in Germany with people comparing the members of the Stasi to that of the Gestapo, 40 years previous. Recent German history is littered with examples of the Stasi's uncompromising approach  some of which are still coming to fruition. In brief the Stasi spied on, imprisoned, and ruined the lives of anyone it chose and in the immediate aftermath of the war there were a lot of deaths or ""liquidations"" of opponents. In later years the Stasi abandoned this approach in favour of psychological torture and exile. They would routinely brake into peoples flats, steal underwear (to be bottled as odour samples) for identification purposes and use psychotropic drugs on those under house arrest, this would mostly happen due to tip offs from fellow GDR citizens turned informers, as once an informer certain liberties would follow. Artists and those of a creative nature (writers, poets, journalist etc) were a favoured choice of the Stasi and their work was often either stifled, scrutinised, compromised or even destroyed  similarities with the manner in which Nazi's burned books are blatantly apparent; the film also makes plenty of references to books being a source of provocation. Because of all this GDR citizens lived in world of fear and paranoia, as individuals they were afraid and suspicious of all those they met. It was, without question, a totalitarian society.",

In a world full of suspicion and secret services entering every people's life, the STASI officer risks his job for a noble cause, which the communists hated at that time - THE CULTURE.

It's difficult to think of any American director, even our finest, who made a true milestone during their first time in the director's chair. The Lives of Others is seamless. The pace of the film is intense, steady, fixated, allowing smaller things, technical situations, difficult to imagine on film, to become riveting moments integrated into the film as a whole. The drama of the movie's story is sternly realized with an almost cold perspective that allows realism that is impartial, though the film's stance is very obvious and clear. The historical detail of the look and feel of East Berlin during the time of the Berlin Wall in the 1980s is very bleak and clearly portrayed as such by the impeccable camera. According to a friend who saw this movie with me, who was studying abroad at one point in East Berlin during the time it takes place, the realization of setting and time period is perfectly realistic.",

The cast does an incredible especially the male roles including the Captain who eavesdrops on the German playwright. He is torn between his country and doing the right thing. The film is surprising. Martina Gedeck is the best German actress alive in my opinion. She plays Christa with conviction and believability. Her character is the actress and playwright's lover. There is lot going on here since life under Communism was strictly under surveillance. Anything could get you locked up and imprisoned even the most innocent offenses. It's no wonder life under Communism was paranoid and frightening situation. It was all about control and lack of decision making. For anybody like myself whose parents were raised in Communist Poland, East Germany appeared to have everything under it's control much like George Orwell's novel, 1984. You don't want to be caught or even suspect under East German rule during this time. The film's almost perfect except I would like have seen a more solid ending.",

128,27 March 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, A conversation or two.,"Set primarily in the 80s, 'The Lives Of Others (2006)' tells the story of a writer who finds himself on the wrong side of the East German government via the man whom has been assigned to listen into his every word. The movie is interesting in that we're essentially watching someone watch someone. Each story can only exist within the context of the other, which leads to a complex and mature experience that touches on resonant themes of privacy, loneliness and personal freedom. The protagonist is a bit of a blank slate. However, as he slowly becomes more and more invested in the lives of those he monitors, he definitely undergoes a full character arc. The movie itself is often surprisingly suspenseful, brilliantly constructed to eek the most out of each potential moment of tension. Its main asset is, I suppose, its natural dramatic irony, which is used wonderfully throughout. Sometimes, the thing is a little too slow for its own good. It also has an extended denouement that seeps the life out of its otherwise superb climax. These final moments do provide a nice bit of closure but they mostly recycle old information and don't feel efficient at all. The decision to end on, essentially, a joke is questionable, too. Still, the piece is an entertaining and effective thriller overall. 7/10",

While the basic premise of the story is interesting, von Donnersmarck (great name!) does little to enliven the film or tap into the potential for suspense.

So much that we see the East German socialists do, the ones in the highest ranks of over-dominant power, is to make sure everyone is in check by means of fear and tactics of interrogation and surveillance, in The Lives of Others concerns why certain basic freedoms are important, especially in the arts, and that change is not only possible, but paramount for people in bad circumstances.",
146,23 August 2021,briancham1994,9, Chilling tale of paranoia,"This film perfectly encapsulates the dull, grey existence of life in East Germany, not just physically but also the spiritual paranoia that comes with totalitarian rule. The intelligence agency Stasi is terrifying in this film not just because of the reach of its surveillance, but the way it dictates everyone's lives - travel permits, career promotions, educational graduation and so on. The end result for the protagonist is a paranoid life punctuated by constantly watching every word and scrutinising every companion for potential betrayal. The direction and cinematography complement this with oppressive and inhuman looking imagery to deny any warmth in the characters.",

It's a shame that Communism has not been examined and discredited as thoroughly as the equally evil Nazism. It's a little hard to comprehend the tyranny, from a place as free as the United States. The risks these people were taking, to accomplish such a minor thing, publishing an article that was fairly mildly critical of the government, should really strike home for those of us living in free countries. The only problem with the portrayal is that the two main characters, who seem at the start to be committed Communists, both turn away, showing their humanity, when in reality I think that this must have been fairly rare, from fear if not for logic or conscience. But even so the showing of an unapologetic taste of Communist tyranny is unusual, even to this day, and all the more powerful for that.",

Set in the fascist era of Germany, Das Leben Der Anderen depicts a surveyor's (Wieser) interaction with a seemingly loyal writer (Dreyman) through suspicions from the Minister.

He, though, has had to alter his writings to keep the Party off his back and keep in business, and she has to give herself regularly to a repulsive culture 'boss'. At the same time, Donnersmarck makes the link with the machinations of the system as we see first, Stasi spies at the theatre, then star interrogator Captain Wiesler (Muhe) mercilessly extract the wrong information from a prisoner at great length before lecturing young party workers on his good work. The story's, and Wiesler's, snapping point comes when the truly nasty Colonel Grubitz (Tukur) verbally tortures a student in the office canteen after hearing his joke about Erich Honecker, East German premier. The tiny seed of doubt is planted in the mind of this perfect automaton. It's, on the face of it, a complex thriller, and the camera-work and overall feel would be well suited to black and white, so 'noir' is it. All the performances are excellent, from the villainous party leaders to the confused neighbour, but it's really Ulrich Muhe's film. The transfiguration from unfeeling loner to all-out mensch is physical. He starts out looking gaunt like a Giacometti 'walker' and ends as a lonesome teddy bear. It's a tragic story on many levels, but there is that strand of redemption. It's possible to save your own soul. CLIFF HANLEY",

The acting was unbelievable, especially the performance of the actor who played Wiesler His communication of the changes this man went through, how we went from being a lonely automaton to risking everything ""for others"" was a landmark of acting, the transition was made through his expressions and his actions, without any speeches or lightning bolts from heaven. All of the acting was superb, even the ""villains"" in the chain of command who epitomized the banality of evil and the mindset of someone who ""goes along to get along"" The arc of the relationship between the playwright and his mistress the actress was poignant and showed the pressures people can give in to when they feel they have no where else to turn. The complexity of the plot requires close attention, but it doesn't drag or get tedious. Finally the poignancy of the situation was heightened by our knowledge, but not that of the protagonists, that within just a few years this whole rotten structure would come tumbling down.

What was this all about? Well I know what it was about, not much, nearly three hours of not much to be precise. Long, grey and boring the cast, especially the Stasi officer (who spend most of the film sat at a desk) must have loved that pay check, quite literally money for nothing. Now there was a nice little thing at the end and the odd bit here and there but that should have taken no more than say twenty minutes to do. Maybe if each showing came with a lecture first filling in the history of the piece it may have been a little different, after all if you didn't live in Germany in 1984 and didn't know all about how the Stasi monitored everyone including each other during that period frequently bugging flats, phones and conducting surveillances then like me you would have been quite lost as the film throws you into to the story. Basically a playwright is being watched by an officer, playwright decides to write some propaganda, officer covers for him because under that evil interrogating exterior beats a heart of grey. That took me less than a minute to write how the hell did they string it out for so long? Anyway this has to be one of the worst foreign films I have seen in a long time, the story is slight, the actors underused, the idea overused and it was just too long. But like I say I might be missing something here as I seem to be in a minority, most reviews have given full stars, one said it wasn't just the best foreign film of the year but the best film period. I'm not sure they see enough films to be honest and I would question if they are actually qualified to do reviews?

If one is familiar with ""Goodbye, Lenin!""'s comic approach on the issue of the fall of the Berlin Wall, he will find the treatment of the story of the characters in ""The Lives of Others"" far more intense and frightening yet endearing as the secret agent in charge of spying on an artist and his lover becomes too involved in the couple's secret lives. Being a very vigilant servant of the System, Wiesler, the agent, knows that his risk of saving the artists who are attacking the GDR whom he has served for almost all his life is akin to throwing everything that matters to him.

I'm sure I would have ended up in prison there. Nice cinematography, and a bunch of good actors, although I didn't know most of them, like Ulrich Mühe for example, that did a great job by the way. Sebastian Koch on the other hand is known by everybody, especially if you watch German movies every now and then, as it seems he plays in all of them, at least the ones I watched. The story is most enjoyable to follow, makes you realize we are lucky we didn't have to live in that horrible atmosphere.

226,11 November 2007,Lejink,9, How the other half lived...,"A marvellous feature, completely drawing the viewer into the gray, grubby world of state surveillance employed in the East German state prior to the collapse of Communism in 1989. The movie portrays the emotional journey of a cold hearted Stasi officer, played brilliantly by the late Ulrich Muhe, ruthlessly efficient in spying and interrogation techniques, who finds that his latest operation, the scrutiny of a suspected rebel playwright and his actress wife, unexpectedly humanises him to the point where he turns against his masters but not before tragedy befalls the couple. The recreation of the soul-less streets of mid 80's East Berlin seems entirely life-like, where every day bland state-sponsored TV attempts to neutralise individual expression of its citizens in a way that George Orwell only imagined some 40 years earlier. The ensemble acting is excellent, especially Muhe in the key role of the worm that turns, his face moving from an emotion-less blank canvas to anguished self-loathing as he transfers allegiance at the film's low-key but marvellously effective climax. All told, you really do feel that this is a slice of life you're watching and not fiction, my only gripe might be the that the writer could perhaps have made his point better by taking as the central subjects a more mundane couple than the slightly rarified examples of a distinguished writer and his famous actress wife. But for a sentiment-free picture of the de-humanising impact of Soviet Bloc tyranny this film is an important and ultimately uplifting testament.",

There are obvious parallels in McCarthyism; but the difference is one of scale. 'The Lives of Others' tells an entertaining, and ultimately moving, story set in East Germany's secret police. What I liked about the film is that it accepts the notion that everyone is compromised (and compromising) in some way in any society; compromise is what we do to survive. Again, the difference is in the degree, and this can change over time. What is less strong is the characterisation; it's not awful, and the lead protagonists do what is necessary to drive the plot, but I've seen deeper movies. Also, there is a lengthy epilogue after the film's emotional climax which seems to exist primarily to provide (unnecessary) feel-good vibes for the audience (structurally, there's a similarity to the ending of 'The Shawshank Redemption' in the way that this works). It's still a good film, both thought-provoking and enjoyable to watch; if the idea of collaboration interests you further, I recommend Kieslowski's early movies, particularly 'No End'.",

The movie's first opening scene shows us Weiseler's unwavering loyalty towards the party and he suspects Georg Dreyman, a writer, of sedition when he is thought to be an ideal citizen by many others. Henceforth a secret operation is ordered by the minister of culture at Dreyman's house with Weiseler in charge of it. From that point he starts to intervene in the lives of Dreyman and his girlfriend Chirsta Maria Seiland and gets to know every personal thing in their lives. He eventually comes to know that the cultural minister is nothing but a competitor of Dreyman and misuses his power to get Christa. When he comes to know that the communist party head (the cultural minister) behaves like a bourgeois and moulds the communist rules according to his whims and fancies, his loyalty which was entirely directed towards the government becomes divided and he empathizes with the lives of Dreyman and Christa Maria Seiland. He becomes a soft- hearted man and tries to save them at every possible opportunity. He does not report that Dreyman has written an article about the movie director, Jerska's death which is prohibited by the law. He also removes the typewriter from under the door sill which would have been a concrete proof that Dreyman is anti-national and he would have punished or killed. After a few years, the communist regime breaks up and he no longer is a stasi official, but a commoner. I liked the last part when he goes to the bookstore to buy a book by Georg Dreyman and the owner asks ""Should I pack it?"" He tells ""No, It is for me."" which has double meanings. One is that he bought the book for himself, another is that the book was written by Dreyman about him, the Stasi official who saved his life.",

Hard in a country where freedom of expression is inevitably challenged by a bully seeking to threaten any form of legitimacy. Be the least suspected of going against the party, could jeopardize their lives forever. The price was very high, and especially for intellectuals was living in this suffocating atmosphere of constant tension, as people of culture were the most frequently considered as possible conspirators. Proponent of this disturbing ""McCarthyism backwards"" was the Stasi, the state police, which with its numerous agents scattered throughout the morbidly crept into the lives of others, collecting fragments of everyday life, the frantic search for subtle clues that can can destroy a life, isolating indefinitely. This is the work you do Gerd Wiesler, the Stasi captain unyielding, icy eyes and attitude severe. One day he is ordered to spy on the famous writer George Dreyman at his home, as it may be a dissident. Wiesler then from his position of control begins to take the role of interlocutor. The first feature of the novice Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck is an undisputed masterpiece. It is primarily a film for his unsettling topicality. In times like this where the violation of privacy is relentless oppression, ""The Lives of Others"" is necessary to shake the conscience. A crude metaphor concerning contamination spreads to levels paroxysmal, like wildfire as a terrible epidemic: the Stasi through its microscopic settlements. Parasite. Inanimate being able to take nourishment only through the domination of living organisms immersed in their peaceful habitat. A constant threat, active and never worn. ""The Lives of Others"" is an intense film, realistic and never redundant: very good Henckel Von Donnersmarck that propels us into a specific historical context, never a show those events, unlike other directors who use history to romanticize silly fiction. ""The Lives of Others"" has the great merit of calligraphy are never, even in the final sequence after the collapse of the wall, nor ever falls into rhetoric. Directed lucid and simple (absent virtuosity space fields, reverse shot, extreme close-ups important) ensure an atmosphere of unrelenting coldness to the film, in full harmony with the troubled air that you breathe in those years. Prey to paranoia, uncontrollable, incurable physical and psychological abuse, the man conscious of no longer master of himself, he tries to put a stop to all this: that is Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe that provides an extraordinary eye) tired subjection of psychology and existential bleakness which is limited, based on pre-cooked meals and embraces a fee, he decided to change was a turning point in his life, taking a key role within the situation. ""The Lives of Others"" is a morality tale about human dignity, the tangible proof that despite the abuse that a totalitarian regime imposes humanity of the individual surfaces, and the burden of consciousness has a decisive role, because a dictatorship can annihilate the mind and body, but not the soul. The essence of ourselves involves the consequences of actions we do. Excellent screenplay never verbose, striking suspense that never falls in rhythm, exceptional performers. And in the end, in the blue eyes of Wiesler once menacing but now full of goodness, finally glimpsed a glimmer of hope and redemption for mankind. Moving.",

It is intelligent, suspenseful, claustrophobic and above all, profoundly moving in a manner that is devoid of cheap sentimentality and refreshingly understated. The cinematography and dialogue often seem inspired by the film noir of Fritz Lang and others. The performances, all from veteran German actors of film and stage, are convincing and haunting. 1984 East Germany is brilliantly recreated in its architecture, fashions and soundtrack. Not only does the movie convey the incredibly sad and pointless destruction of so many wasted lives under a corrupt totalitarian regime, but at its core, depicts the gradual disillusionment of its central character, a Stasi true believer, as he painfully reclaims his humanity at immense personal cost to his life and career. The ending rings true and is not in the superficially overdone style of too much of what comes out of Hollywood these days. This film left me under its spell for days after I watched it. I look forward to seeing it again and again. Its amazing that this is the director's first film and it richly deserved the foreign film Oscar and other accolades it has won. Highly recommended.",

There is nothing negative to say about this movie because it is just one of those films that sticks with you and shows you the dangers of a socialist government when freedom of expression is dismissed. After seeing this political thriller, you will never feel the same way about freedom and privacy. This is not one of those boring political movies, it actually has a great script and the story unfolds at a good pace. The movie actually ranks at 55 in the top 250 movies of all time according to IMDb so it is amongst good company. This is one film you will not want to miss and it exposes everything that is wrong with an authoritarian government.",

The oppressive feeling is there, the indiscriminate distrust, the mutilated human relationships. The second pair of eyes, the hamstrung friendship, the crippled love, the despair, the humiliation.

It starts with as usual German interrogation scene, you would think that this is what gonna happen throughout the whole movie. But Ehh! It introduces to a new artistic couple(George as a play writer and Christa as an actress).The real movie starts here, An avaricious minister gets into the picture who believes George is not the person what he seems on the outside. He engages an officer to bug his house, and find out about his unrevealed secrets.For this work, Wiesler is chosen, who is very good at interrogation as well as at collecting information all by your behaviour patterns. According to me, I won't consider Wiesler to be a bad guy. He gets attached to this couple and forms a well-respected image of them. The point here was about right and wrong and he chooses the right one by helping the couple without being noticed. He was more of a loner.He does good, even sacrifices his own life/job by saving George. Sudden calamities were faced by them. In the end, George came to know that Wiesler helped him someway somehow, so he decides to thank him by writing a novel truly dedicated to him. I've rarely seen movies with this good content, which provoked me to write this. Although it's my first review,and I babbled a lot. Thank You if you read my review.

I resided in Venezuela during the iron fisted dictatorship of Marcos Perez Jimenez. Watching this film I kept thinking of the situations I personally witnessed. It was practically impossible to speak to anyone about anything, except maybe the weather forecast. Nothing to taxi drivers - waiters- hair dressers etc.. You even had to be extremely cautious with people you assumed were close friends. Just one word that wasn't acceptable and away you would go to one one the lovely prisons or if a foreigner out of the country on the next plane.

It's the most comprehensive mirror of that time period that I've ever seen. Whether the name was STB, Securitate, KGB or Stasi - in this case, the movie contains a very realistic portray of the secret police and the surveillance methods used. The movie deserves a better score, is a 9+ movie, I think some people gave it a lower score only because of the dark atmosphere, which I consider is very realistic. Ulrich Mühe, who unfortunately died in 2007, gave here one of the best portrayals of the 'watchdog', a policeman without a personal life, that lives only to spy 'other people lives'.",

262,14 March 2021,judemcrobbie,8, A very good foreign film,"Ulrich Mühe is incredible. That scene that al Pacino rightfully gets a lot of praise in the godfather (the one where just by his eyes we see him decide to kill the man), Ulrich Mühe has that all through the movie. Through the use of mere facial expressions and body language, as he has about 10 lines in the whole thing, portrays all his character's quirks and changes.
The plot is a bit meh: the inciting incident is basically non existent and so we feel no real reason to root for either side or want to know more, however except for this the plot is fine, nothing special but just ok. This is not to say that the concept of the plot is bad, because this is probably one of the most ambitious and entertaining screenplays I've seen so far, have a man be changed just through witnessing the conversations of these people.
The development of Ulrich Mühe's character (Hauptmann Gerd Weisler) is so interesting and gripping. The more he changes to the way we think he should be, going from an almost gestapo type character to the average human just wanting peace, the more no win situations he gets put in. At the start everything is easy and simple and by the end everything is like Sophie's choice. This creates the compelling character and narrative as he keeps this up despite the angst it puts him through.

A striking drama concerning an agent (Ulrich Mühe) of the Eastern Germany Stasi and the man he is spying, a famous writer (Sebastian Koch). The plot is top quality, very well written and captivating. The Stasi suspects of Dreyman (the writer)'s political position, and as the influent person he is, his house is immediately wired and all his steps and breaths are controlled. The agent in charge of the operation, agent Wiesler, is this very tough, cold and incredibly loyal to the government, who slowly starts gaining sympathy towards the Dreyman and his wife, an actress who was keeping a sexual relationship with the minister, afraid to lose her job and reputation, and note that this minister was the one who had ordered the whole operation concerning Dreyman. Wiesler slowly falls back and suddenly, when a friends ""commits suicide"", Dreyman starts planning to write an article about the strange suiciding rate taking place in Eastern Germany, to be sent to the western press. Wiesler covers the whole thing, pretending they were preparing a piece, until the article arrives to West Germany as a bomb and invades the media. In fact, one o the best German movies I've seen, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (both director and writer) actually surprised me, questioning how was it possible to succeed this with The Tourist (2010).

266,25 April 2007,Andy-296,9, Great movie - just a notch down a complete masterpiece,"The Lives of Others is a great, even excellent movie. I can't give it a 10 out of 10 rating, though. On the plus side, the director has a total command of the medium, he knows how to make a suspenseful, thoughtful, entertaining movie, that holds the interest of the audience even at a running time that exceeds 2 hours. What's more, the acting is uniformly extraordinary. Let's talk now about the main reason why I can't give the movie a 10. The emotional heart of the movie is when the Stasi officer in charge of spying the playwright and his girlfriend, a very tough and experienced individual who presumably has worked in many similar cases before, decides instead to protect them. Why he would do that, risking an end to his career and even a charge of treason?. Though his motivations are not altogether clear (he is an extremely reserved man), the change of heart seems to happen in part after listening the playwright playing a sonata on the piano after learning one of his colleagues committed suicide, after years of harassment by the government (he is also uneasy after finding out the Stasi is going for the playwright not for ideological reasons but in order that his beautiful girlfriend would then be available for the repellent minister of culture). As a metaphor from his newly found sensibility, he even steals a book from Brecht from the playwright's house, and is seen reading it. Is this believable? As much as the audience would be moved by a story of redemption, I think it's not. This is not a minor quibble, since this change of heart is really the main plot twist of the movie, on which all the film is build. The ending has a great closing line, but is also a bit difficult to accept. From what I know, few if any Stasi officers have expressed any remorse from what they did, and continue to defend their actions. That aside, this is a great film, from a young director that really knows how to make a movie that is both highly entertaining and thought provoking. And it has many great scenes that you vividly remember later. The best one: the young Stasi officer making a ill-timed Honecker joke in the cafeteria. It's a scene that's so good on so many levels.",

As a viewer I could really believe that I am looking into Eastern Germany in the 1980s. The wiring and the ensuing connection between the artist's flat and the cold, drafty attic with the listening post perfectly showed the perverseness and the absurdity of that particular totalitarian system. The highlight for me was, when a guest in the apartment, an enthusiastic journalist from the West, pops the cork of a bottle of champagne. The cork hits a light switch in which a hearing device is hidden, a very quick and short cut to the attic shows how the guy with the headphones winces in silent pain. The movie also makes it very clear that the Socialist systems outmaneuvered themselves with their paranoia  what remains of them are vestiges of Russian style secret service systems (but that is older then Socialism and probably has little to do with it).",

286,9 June 2015,aiggpm,7, Truth is stranger than fiction,"Can you imagine a world where people are continuously spied on, where the police set up surveillance equipment in the attics, where even typewriters are registered and, in spite of this,a world accepting of refugees? I am not talking about science fiction. I am talking about real life, the real events that took place in East Germany before the Fall of the Wall.While I was watching 'The lives of others'I couldn't help comparing it to another film, 'Good Bye, Lenin'; both are widely applauded approaches to the recent history of East Germany. But I think one of them is definitely superior to the other; read on if you'd like to know which.Both films are German and were released more or less at the same time -around 2005- and they share factual accuracy and the atmosphere of that historical period, although the first one takes place mainly in the years before the Fall of the Wall and the second, in the years immediately after. Both films have a lot in common, such as an appealing theme, plausible dialogues, lots of moving scenes and convincing acting. In spite of sharing a common theme, they have different approaches, since 'The lives of others' shows the story of a playwright who is being spied on by 'the Party'. What is a cold relationship at the beginning of the story turns into sympathy, what seems love turns into treason, what should have been informing on somebody turns into respect and admiration. On the other hand, 'Good bye, Lenin!'is very innovative mainly because it has a large dose of comedy, which is remarkably powerful. When his mother suffers a heart attack and awakes from a coma seriously weakened, Alex, the main character has to pretend that nothing has changed, that East Berlin is the same as it was before the Fall of the Wall, because a great shock like that could cause her death, so there he goes doing the impossible to keep the 'status quo'. This situation leads to entertaining scenes and appealing dialogue. In addition, both films were recorded on set and on location -we can enjoy watching what Karl Marx Allee looked like almost thirty years ago.However, although both films portray our recent history very convincingly, I strongly recommend 'Good bye, Lenin!'because it is funny, moving and grabs your attention from the very first moment.

289,25 August 2007,Buddy-51,8, fine drama despite a gaping hole in the screenplay,"It seems somehow appropriate that ""The Lives of Others"" should be set in 1984, since it takes us to a world where George Orwell's fictional Big Brother has become an all-too-real fact of everyday life. The place is East Germany, five years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, where not just every action but virtually every thought can be surveyed and monitored by the secret police agency known as STASI. As self-appointed ""voices of the people,"" artists suffer an even more intense level of scrutiny than the average, everyday citizen. As a result, many of them have either fled the country, committed suicide, or compromised their artistic vision in exchange for security and safety. Georg Dreyman, a successful writer and dramatist, has chosen the latter course of action, towing the party line in his works better than most of his fellow artists. Nevertheless, Wiesler, a security agent with STASI, suspects that Dreyman may not be quite the ideological purist Wiesler's fellow officers believe him to be (Wiesler may also be motivated by the fact that he is attracted to Dreyman's beautiful girlfriend, a well-known stage actress named Christa-Marie Sieland, and, thus, has reasons of his own for wanting Dreyman out of the picture). To confirm his suspicions, Wiesler has Dreyman's apartment bugged so that he and Sieland can be kept under surveillance twenty-four hours a day. After awhile, however, Wiesler begins to soften in his stance towards Dreyman and, before long, he is betraying his own vows to the state by whitewashing his official reports on the writer.",

300,26 October 2016,matthewmeyerhuber,10, A heart-wrenching window into the workings of the Stasi and the GDR,"The Lives of Others shows the ways in which the Stasi manipulated and intruded on the lives of East German citizens. The strength of this portrait is in its portrayal of Haupmann Gerd Wiesler as surprisingly human. But: what does it mean to be human? A recurring theme in German history is that of humanity and evil: are evil people human, or monsters? Or are humans really just evil? Such questions come up repeatedly throughout the film. Georg Dreymann and his girlfriend Christa-Marie Sieland are the primary objects of surveillance throughout the movie. Dreymann is a playwright known for his humanistic portrayals—his plays are, in the words of Minister Hempf, optimistic and full of hope. Hempf replies to this by telling Dreymann that ""people don't change (themselves)."" The tension between Dreymann's worldview and that of Hempf plays out in Wiesler's character development. At the beginning of the film, Wiesler matches Hempf, as he tirelessly and zealously seeks out ""arrogant"" enemies of the state. His perception of humanity is that they must be monitored carefully. It is as if Wiesler considers himself something inhuman, and this is evidenced by his Spartan existence. Even his haircut appears severe; his apartment is empty, and his kitchen bare. Wiesler knows nothing of the comforts of home, or family, or love. Yet, as the film develops, he begins to desperately seek the things he encounters in the lives of others. First, he seeks substitutes and living vicariously, hiring a prostitute and entering Dreymann's and Sieland's apartment just to experience it. However, he later takes on a more active role, sympathizing with Dreymann and the other playwrights, and even their subversive activities. The climax of Wiesler's development comes at the death of Dreymann's friend and colleague Albert Jerska. Dreymann plays The Sonata for a Good Man. ""Can anyone who has heard this music— really heard it—be a bad person?,"" Dreymann asks. Wiesler, with a tear streaming down his face as he hears the music through his headphones, has heard the music. Wiesler eventually pays the price for his sympathy with his career. At the fall of the Berlin Wall, he is found opening letters in a windowless basement; when he learns of the end of the wall, he walks out, abandoning the GDR for good. Meanwhile, in the coming years, Dreymann discovers that whoever was monitoring him had helped him escape certain imprisonment—a man identified only by his name HGW XX/7. He dedicates a novel, The Sonata for a Good Man, to HGW XX/7. Wiesler, working as a postman, sees the book in a bookstore and reads the note from Dreymann. As Wiesler takes the book up to the counter, the cashier asks if he wants it gift wrapped. ""No,"" Wiesler says, ""it's for me."" ",
301,30 March 2007,mmunier,8," You may not be paranoid, but they're really after you","Well those well wishers who wanted the film to go abroad, your wish is on the other side of the globe I presume. I have just seen it in Sydney Australia, mind you not in the big theatres, in an independent theatre with a modest crowd too. As for our viewing experience...Wondurbar (excuse my German attempt). Yes wonderful, I won't go over the plot, the characters etc. for two reasons. 1)I'm not too gifted in that domain, 2) It's all there many times in many pages if you care! What I can talk about is the way I felt during the screening and after. I was totally engrossed by the story, and for the story itself too, not for its credibility although I'm convinced it's in the scope of reality but for the way it was delivered. I did meet someone in relation to my job who told me what it was like to live in these days and this situation. He was from Hungary, if you've seen the film you might appreciate what Hungary must have been like in comparison to East Germany. Well yes in the final analysis it's a feel good movie but thanks to the clever direction it receives and takes. I appreciated so much the way the end is handled. I recently started to do something different with my visit to IMDb before ""putting my 5 cents"" I read the default setting comments that is best first. Then I change the filter to ""Hated it"" Because it's interesting to read why some people don't like a mostly popular movie. I did not tick their comments as helpful, yet in someway they were but I don't think they put their comments to win a popularity contest and I have little knowledge about the subject to take side, yet I can imagine the difficulty one would have to appreciate a work that portrays something quite different to what one believes to know very well. As for me the story worked very well the characters were so well represented and the ending somehow contributed to restored some faith in human beings",
302,12 November 2016,marissalozser,10," Informative, Sad, Well-done","This movie reveals the detail and depth the Stasi went in to intruding and spying on the lives of the citizens of the DDR. It is eye-opening and very informative for those who do not know a lot about the DDR. Two themes of this movie, love and watching, are present throughout the entire film. Wiesler is desperate for love or even just a human connection. Dreymann and Christa-Maria have a strong relationship, even after it is tested by Christa's questionable actions. Wiesler longs for this kind of love after observing it day after day. Wiesler observes Dreymann from afar at the play, and the Stasi soon begins to spy on him as well. The neighbor across the hall watches out her peephole at what has been done to Dreymann's apartment. Another theme is change. Hempf says that people can never truly change, but we see that this is not the case through Wiesler's softening and sympathy for Georg and Christa Maria. Wiesler begins to care truly care for the writer and his girlfriend whom he spies on. He takes risks that could cost him his job because of the empathy he has gained through intruding on their lives. He even makes a point to tell Christa Maria that she is a great actress and that many people love her when he gets the chance. This movie is very well done and thoughtful. The only downfall to this film, perhaps, is how sad it is, particularly the ending.",
303,27 October 2016,dancer-27792,10," An Unexpected, yet Intriguing Story","For those who love history, this movie is for you. As a college student in the United States I only knew about the DDR from what I had learned in history classes and the little I learned from traveling in Europe. I could never fully imagine the effects that the wall and the Stasi had on the people of Germany. Das Leben der Anderen gives an outsider an inside look as to what East Germany was like. Wiesler is a Stasi captain who has been assigned to monitor Georg Dreymann, a German playwright who is trying to get support for his friend Jerska who has been blacklisted by the German government. Wiesler bugs Dreymann's apartment, and he is soon thrust into the world of the writer. Though this starts out as a simple mission, Wiesler begins to see how the government has affected these people. He begins to care about Dreymann, especially towards the end of the movie. One of the main arguments that is brought to attention in the film is that people never change. Obviously that is not true. The most significant change throughout the film is Wiesler. He doesn't view his job as a simple mission anymore. He has to protect the people that he has grown to care about, even if it ends up costing him his job. The film shows that people can change. Wielser is always associated with the color gray, a very neutral color. This shows that not everything can be black and white. One must dig deeper to see the true nature of people. It shows the darkness that was within Germany, parts that those who didn't live in the time may not fully understand until seeing the film. I think everyone should see this film because it brings history to life. There are so many layers to every aspect of this film. Each time you watch you can find something new that you didn't notice before. It truly makes you think.",

306,21 August 2010,Jay_Exiomo,10, Multifaceted spy drama,"With The Lives of Others (Das Leben der Anderen), debuting director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck crafts a simultaneously gripping and intelligent political drama about an agent for East Germany's secret police. Just as a Stasi agent finds himself irrevocably drawn into the lives of the couple he's spying on, so does Donnersmarck compel his viewers into an oh-so meticulously crafted piece set in pre-unified Germany, five years before the Berlin Wall's crumbling. Capt. Wiesler, played by the late Ulrich Mühe with an eerie adeptness, is assigned to conduct a covert surveillance on playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Wiesler initially carries out his task with such calculated efficiency, but gradually finds himself pulled into an emotional web that slowly peels away his impassive facade. In the same way, Donnersmarck lets The Lives of Others unfold into a beautifully structured story that's powerfully told and populated with richly defined characters. It's at once a chilling reminiscence of a recent part in German history and a touching portrait of the human social network.",
307,2 May 2007,tnrcooper,10, Incredible study of corrosive effect of eavesdropping,"This film won the Oscar for best foreign film in 2007 and from my point-of-view is quite deserving of the Oscar. I hear Pan's Labyrinth was fantastic and I heard also that ""Water"" was very good. That said, I do not think it would be a pox on the judgment of the Academy in the future that Das Leben was awarded the Oscar because I imagine it compares favorably, or at least is in the same class, as two of those other films, and probably the other nominees as well. The film covers the lives and activities of those on both sides of the Stasi (East German secret police) from 1984 over a period of several years and then tracks the fallout from this activity through the period around the fall of the Berlin Wall and into the early 1990s. The premise for the film is intriguing and unlike anything I have ever seen before. It follows one East German Stasi agent named Wiesler (a very controlled and seething and fantastic Ulrich Muehe) as he eavesdrops on the wiretapped apartment of a prominent playwright, Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) who the Secret Police wants to oversee because of concerns about his loyalty to the state. The do not have more specific suspicions than that, but the Stasi is feeling more pressured to uphold the image of Communism in East Germany and so they are cracking down on supposed heterodoxy in whatever form it takes.

308,3 April 2022,demiurgiac,10, On my first trip to Europe...,"In 1983 as a young male U. S. citizen, I took a train from West Berlin to East Berlin one day. After enjoying most of the day there it was early afternoon and I decided to return to West Berlin via Check Point Charie but didn't know how to get there. I found a kind park and asked 3 or 4 other men if they could direct me to Check Point Charlie. No one seemed to be able to help me (I didn't speak German). Then a very attractive young woman approached me and asked (in good English) if she could help me. Long story sort we ended up have coffee at place she recommended. Probably spent 3-4 hours with her. Loved it. After watching this movie I thought about that experience and couldn't help wondering if...",
