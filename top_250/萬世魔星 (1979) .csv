0,16 December 2013,gogoschka-1,10, One of the most intelligent comedies ever made,"Personally, I believe this to be one of the most intelligent comedies ever made. It might not appear that way at first because the film does have its share of simple slapstick and ""naughty"" moments, but generally, the topics the Pythons tackle here are very serious - albeit dealt with in a way that makes this a true contender for the funniest film of all time. ",/
1,24 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10, Utterly hilarious from start to finish!,"Life of Brian may have caused controversy on release, but this has always been my personal favourite of the Monty Python movies. Why? Because it is hilarious! True, the story isn't the best component of the film, but everything else works wonders. It is essentially an irreverent and inspired send up of religious epics, and is helped brilliantly by gags and a script that is so joyfully juvenile, if extremely rude, and quotable. Quotes such as ""He's not the Messiah. He is a very naughty boy"" and ""Welease Wodewick"" had me literally peeing my pants. The sets are realistic and all of the Pythons who here take several pot shots at their favourite targets, especially Terry Jones, Graham Chapman and Michael Palin are on top form. Overall, irreverent and hilarious, a must see! 10/10 Bethany Cox",r
2,7 March 2022,filmbuff-05706,10, I'm A Christian And This Is My Favorite Comedy Of All Time.,"Monty Python's The Life of Brian is notorious for offending many Christians- especially at the time of it's release 43 years ago- despite many of these protesters being non-viewers. However, I'm a Christian and this is my favorite comedy movie. (Admittedly, my love for Bible-themed movies plays a factor in that.)",e
3,10 October 2005,lee_eisenberg,10, Ave Monty Python!,"This is, in my opinion, the best religious movie ever made. Monty Python's Flying Circus knows how to do everything hilariously. Focusing on Brian Cohen (Graham Chapman), who gets mistaken for the messiah in Judea in 33 AD, the movie pokes fun at everything: Romans, Jews, imperialism, even extraterrestrials. With sardonic lines almost every minute, they play religious fundamentalism for what it is: silly. I don't even know which scene was my favorite; every part was so funny. You'll never forget the song at the end. This is comedy in its greatest form, and it makes sense that it would come from the guys who brought us the ""parrot sketch"". Absolutely a hoot.",v
4,16 May 2020,gbill-74877,8," Razor sharp, and still holds up","Marvelous satire of religion and its followers - how the message is distorted, how factions invariably form and fight one another, and how blind worship quickly replaces reason (and even kindness). After the Sermon on the Mount is delivered to a crowd who mostly can't hear Jesus and squabble among themselves, one guy walks off commenting ""What Jesus fails to appreciate is that it's the meek who are the problem,"" in shades of the conservative view in 1979 and today. Mostly it's just good, sacrilegious fun, sometimes venturing into territory that's now frowned upon (like making fun of a speech impediment), but overall very creative and intelligent. Here's another funny bit:",i
5,13 October 1999,alice liddell,10, Still one of the funniest films of all time.,"It's impossible for me to be objective about this film.  I know every scene and line by heart.  Not because I'm one of those ghastly Python nerds, whose anal obsessiveness sucks the whole spirit out of everything they did, and actually misses the joke, which is on them; they are the perfect subjects for a Python lampoon.  No.  I only know LIFE OF BRIAN so intimately because I've seen it so often, it's still one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen, and persists in being hilarious despite familiarity, which, as in so much Python did, is the reverse of what comedy is 'supposed' to be made of (i.e. surprise).",e
6,21 December 2016,Hitchcoc,10, A Comment on Our Gullibility,"This is such a fine movie. It involves a guy who was born just down the street in Bethlehem. The Magi go to him first and then realize they are confused and leave. He tries to lead a normal life, but word gets out that he is the Messiah. He does everything he can to get this off his back, but a group of followers begin interpreting his words as great wisdom and godliness. It gets so bad that when they are sent to check out ""the other Guy"" they ultimately find his pronouncement (actually non-pronouncements) to be much more impressive. There is a hilarious scene where he tries to make a statement about the Romans, but his Latin is so bad he is force to write it over and over on the walls, like an American schoolboy. The final scene is incredible. If you've never heard the song or seen the images, check it out. I would imaging there are some people who find this movie blasphemous. I consider it one of the greatest parodies ever produced.",w
7,21 March 2019,the_barnacle,10, 'Do you find it wisible...when I say the name...Biggus...Dickus?',"Famous lines from Michael Palin as Pontius Pilate...and also my favourite lines from this wondrous film. This is not a piece of criticism, just an exhibition of love. For those of you who believe that Holy Grail is better - I'm sorry to inform you that you're wrong. Life of Brian has such good consistent humour that really can't be beaten. The variety and range of characters the Pythons play is sublime. The chemistry they have with each of other is what makes the film work so well. I won't ramble on anymore because most of what I want to say has already been said!",/
8,29 June 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," Still funny, after 25 years","When a film is still funny 25 years after it's made, and doesn't feel particularly aged, even a quarter of a century later, then you know that you've struck gold. The famous Monty Python crew once again take a well-known subject and make a lot of fun of it. This time, the subject is religion, or, more specifically, Christianity. Everyone who knows at least a little about Christianity, which is pretty much anyone from the western world, will probably be able to laugh at something in this movie. Unless, of course, you are very Christian yourself, in that case you will probably feel that the film is blasphemous(I don't personally think so, since it makes fun of the followers and the general stupidity of people and organizations back in 30-something A.D., rather than Jesus and his teachings). The plot is about as incoherent as the usual Monty Python team film, though it should be noted that, like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it is an actual film, and not a series of sketches, like, for example, the Meaning of Life. It's about as paced as they usually are, most of the scenes contain a lot of jokes, and then they move on to the next scene, after about five minutes of jokes and sight gags. This is, unfortunately, the problem with their films; if you don't like the jokes, the film might seem extremely slow to you; of course, one could argue that Monty Python mainly make movies for the jokes sake, but they could do better on the pacing, for the sake of viewers who don't like all those repeated jokes. That's not to say that I don't like them, I laugh at them most of the time, heck, I laughed so hard that I almost got stomach ache from it at one particular instant. But, I guess that a lot of people won't like them for this way of making movies. Oh well. You can't please everyone. The humor is great, it's standard Python wacky, crazy humor, so every Python fan should enjoy it. People who don't like Monty Python should give this a chance too, if they have at least a little humor, and they aren't Christian extremists. Christian ""believers"" can probably laugh at it too, like I said, it's not the religion itself, it's more the brainwashed followers that the film makes fun of. All in all, a great film for fans of the Python crew, and people who have a sense of humor about religion(a dark sense of humor, that is). I recommend it to fans of Monty Python, people who enjoy dark humor and people who can laugh a little at the less intelligent parts of Christianity. I fall into all three categories, and I loved it. 8/10",r
9,20 December 2004,j30bell,9, A Masterwork of British Comedy,"In Life of Brian, Python created what John Cleese called simply ""our masterpiece"". As a piece of writing, it is the most impressive of the three feature length Python movies. The scenes remain episodic, but there is a much more coherent narrative than in the earlier Holy Grail  I loved HG too, but for different reasons. The characters (well about one or two of the characters) have acquired some subtle shading, which is rare in comedy and, alas, rare in British comedy in particular. The plight of Chapman's Brian is one that I really cared about (although his death is also extremely funny, upbeat and one of the truly iconic moments in British cinema).",w

11,21 June 2004,Quinoa1984,10," Not necessarily laugh-out-loud every minute, but it's satirical edge and wit is as clever as the technical side of the film","Monty Python's follow-up to their cult smash Holy Grail was Life of Brian, a film that takes on (if not always with the utmost seriousness, then usually with a mix of silliness and slight intellectualism) the believers in religions, the zealous nature that belief brings out in people.  I first saw the film in the theater upon its re-release last month, and I found it very funny, though not with the kind of belly laughs that I had on my first reaction to Holy Grail.  It's not without it's scenes that stick out as some of Python's finest (the Stoning, Pilate's scenes, the Spaceship sequence), even as sometimes it goes a little too broad for comfort (part of the colisseum).",1

20,24 August 2019,ThomasDrufke,9, Still Holds Up,"I don't think I was of the right age to appreciate Monty Python and the Holy Grail when I first watched it. It takes a certain kind of mindset to be ready for the extravagant humor that these guys bring, and boy was I ready this time for Life of Brian. Insane, irreverent, and offensive humor are just sprinkles on top of this wonderfully ridiculous adventure comedy. Heck, this is a spoof of a biblical film with a spaceship that pops in for about 30 seconds, a stoning scene that just keeps getting funnier and funnier, and a joke about male genitalia that somehow holds up 40 something years later. This is one of the funniest films of all time.",e
21,11 February 2002,ptpenry,10, Stunningly funny,"One of my fave films of all time, this film has so many laugh-out-loud jokes and ridiculous thought processes that it would probably be unfair to pick out just a few. Tough - I'm going to: John Cleese as the legionnary Latin teacher rebuking Brian not for daring to use graffiti on the Roman fort but for using the wrong tense, Michael Palin trying to find his place in life as an ex-leper, Terry Jones as Brian's mother trying to protect him from myrrh - let's face it, we've all wondered what myrrh is ! The bit that always makes me laugh without fail is something that isn't always noticed - when Michael Palin is having a go at the guards; ""Do you find it risible when I say the name of my friend Biggus Diccus ?"" if you look carefully you'll see that Palin is trying really hard not to laugh.",f

24,19 May 2019,waltersjon,10, Life of Brian is Monty Python's greatest work,Life of Brian was radical at the time and it's still a great anti establishment and anti authority film. Which pokes fun at politics and religion and status. It's so funny and some of the scenes are so sharp with lots of historical in jokes. As someone involved in politics I particularly love the idea that Reg 'our glorious leader' can't go on the raid as 'he has a bad back' yet he's happy to martyr the rest of the team. And when they call for a meeting and pass motions it is as Judith says 'perfectly simple Reg' that they should just go and try and stop the Romans' 'nailing him up.' And Brian's success is greeted with shocked surprise and the announcement that 'we need doers in our movement' (unlike Reg). Another highlight has to be Reg asking 'what have the Romans ever done for us.' And as the film ends tunefully there's a message for us all 'Always look on the bright side of life.',t
25,27 December 2005,MrVibrating,10, One of my all-time favourites,"While Quest for the Holy Grail was funny because it was so low-budgetty and silly, Life of Brian is more advanced and with a greater variation of humour.

34,17 December 2011,rmax304823,7, Cheerful Nihilism.,"There's a scene in this send up of Biblical movies and stories that always gets a chuckle out of me. At the end, there are a dozen or so men strung up there and left to die on crosses. Brian, the protagonist, is one of them. He's done nothing to deserve it. His friends and rescuers have failed him. But his crucified neighbor sums up the most apt attitude by cheerfully advising Brian not to be so glum about it all. He begins to sing and whistle a song, ""Always Look On The Bright Side of Life,"" that contains incongruous lyrics that are too vulgar to reproduce here. Not only, ""Always look on the bright side of Death/ Just before you draw your terminal breath,"" but ""Life's a piece of s***/ When you look at it...."" Monty Python seem to me to have been entirely serious, amid the gaggle of gags, in skewering all of our intense dispositions to follow one or another social or religious movement. As far as I know they were only explicit about it in the penultimate scene of ""The Meaning of Life,"" which wound up with an actor in drag advising us to try to be nice to one another. I think it was meant seriously.",

Life Of Brian loses some of the Monty Python's originality compare to The Holy Grail, not that i say Life Of Brian should be the same like The Holy Grail, like breaking the rules and all that stuff, Life Of Brian did more of like a real movie than The Holy Grail, but it's just the story that not as engaging as before, not awful, but it's not as engaging, i enjoy the first 30 minutes of the film though the comedy didn't work completely, the 15 minutes after that i was completely lost, and the rest is the helpful one, because the rest is the one works perfectly fine with me, i enjoy it and the comedy works perfectly, so overall though Life Of Brian did has pretty lot of flaws but the movie still mostly enjoyable and mostly funny.",
39,3 April 2007,jluis1984,10, Probably Monty Python's movie masterpiece...,"Story says that after the enormous success of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", a reporter asked the comedy troupe about their next film project. Not having an answer for that, Eric Idle answered ""Jesus Christ - Lust for Glory"" as a joke, and it became their typical answer to questions about the Python's future projects. Fortunately, what started as a joke soon began to be taken seriously by the comedians as an interesting project to make, and they began working in a movie, not about the life and times of Jesus Christ (as they were unable to find anything to mock about it), but about the credulity and hysteria of those who follow messianic saviors. ""Life of Brian"" was the name of the movie, and as soon as it was released quickly became known as one of the funniest and most controversial works done by the Pythons, and not without a reason!",
40,15 January 2022,nickenchuggets,10, The bright side of life,"As sacrilegious as it may be, there's no denying the fact that Monty Python's Life of Brian is one of the most acclaimed comedy films ever. Because this movie bears MP's name, that alone should tell you that it's going to be absolutely brilliant. It has a simple enough premise, but still manages to be witty and complex via its expertly written scenes and highly original gags, which are often still funny to witness decades later. The reason why this film drew such heavy criticism back in the 70s when it came out is apparent right from the beginning. The movie's plot centers around a man named Brian (Graham Chapman), who just so happens to be born in the stable next to baby Jesus in ancient Judea (now israel). When Brian becomes an adult, he starts to hate the Roman Empire for occupying his land and oppressing its inhabitants. This is a rather problematic mental dilemma for him to be in, considering he was born to a roman father and jewish mother. Later on, Brian joins a quasi-terrorist organization called the People's Front of Judea, and John Cleese is a member of it. The PFJ enlists Brian's help in order to try and capture the wife of the roman governor Pontius Pilate, who would later go on to allow Jesus' crucifixion. However, Brian is captured and brought before Pilate and some of his guards. Pontius explains how his cousin named Biggus Dickus (I'm serious) is coming to visit soon, and in the ensuing hilarity, Brian manages to escape captivity. Soon, people around Judea start to follow him wherever he goes, mistaking him for a holy figure like Jesus. They follow him to his mother's house, then out into a barren wasteland, even keeping their faith in him when he tells them to go away. Meanwhile, the PFJ hatches a new plot to use Brian's mistaken identity to their advantage by saying he is able to cure any ailment. Brian is recaptured by roman soldiers and is now going to be crucified. A large amount of civilians gather outside Pilate's palace, who has agreed to set a prisoner of their choosing free. Everyone says that they want Brian to be let go, but it's too late, and he's already in the process of being bound to a cross. Guards arrive at Brian's crucifixion site and tell him he's been pardoned, but everyone else being crucified shouts that their names are Brian as well, and thus deserve to be let go. Brian ends up staying on the cross with the other condemned men, and eventually suffers a slow, horrible death. This movie is just hilarious. Back then, it's easy to see why it was considered so offensive, but in today's less religious world, it can easily be said that Life of Brian is possibly the best comedy ever. Some things in it weren't funny to me, but mostly, the movie has very smart writing and relies on complex humor to make people laugh. One thing I found especially funny was when one of the roman guards comes to two men in a room to find where Brian is, and they can't answer him because both of them have speech impediments. As soon as the guard leaves, they resume a conversation they were having and talk normally. Another standout is when a ""suicide team"" is sent to Brian in order to rescue him, but all they do upon reaching him is literally commit suicide all at once as a form of protest. I know the scene where Pilate talks about his cousin is probably the most famous, but I wanted to discuss some other funny scenes that I feel are more neglected. The ending to this movie is quite depressing, as no one manages to rescue Brian, but everyone being crucified sings about how important it is to not be negative, and everything in the world seems right. To make a long story short, Life of Brian is arguably Monty Python's best film, even more so than Holy Grail. Both are good, but I found that Holy Grail is more laid back and doesn't try as hard to be offensive. The characters in Life of Brian definitely curse a lot more. Doing it really often gets annoying, but the movie knows when to restrain itself. Due to its ability to parody a relatively taboo subject such as Jesus' crucifixion and get away with it, I have no choice but to consider Life of Brian as one of the best comedy films.",

Brilliantly written dialogue proves once more that Monty Python guys have something different from others but unique and so great that will get you in tears from laughing. Sarcasm and making fun of things must not be taken hardly but with this great way of putting things it never gets boring and always gives you something new to look for. Even when it feels like it's going to be serious in part of second it turns into a huge joke which will keep you wondering what next they have to prove how magnificent they are. Only thing that was over limit was scene with spaceship and it was somewhat fun but it seemed like dull idea and finally movie could go without that easily and still be great. Idea was quite original but how they did it was not so good otherwise everything was pretty original and fabulous. 4/4,

If God created the world and everything in it, then as a part of that creation came laughter, and I suspect that even the bible has good things about laughter, and the joy that such laughter brings. In many cases when I think about religion all I tend to see are sad and glum people, much like the flagellates, who forever whip themselves believing that by inflicting pain upon themselves they can bring themselves closer to God. I think the opposite is true though because in reality it is not pain that will bring you closer to God, but laughter.",

57,7 June 2018,CIDMoosa,8, Classic British Comedy !,"Coming from the Monty Python group, Life of Brian is classic British comedy at its best - perhaps one of the most intellectual comedies made. Downright sardonic and profane in its making, Life of Brian is all about Brian who is born on Christmas day in a stable next to Jesus and spends his life being mistaken for a messiah. Brian's life is sketched parallel to that of Jesus, cleverly letting the filmmakers lampoon everything from religious zealotry, mob hysteria, sword/sandal epic movies and some hard hitting political travesty. All the gags and sequences could appear a bit juvenile to those not familiar with the Monty python style of comedy , but the movie is indeed a laugh riot and the makers live up to their earlier hit Monty Python and the Holy Grail with downright clever satirical wit and commentary on totalitarianism, history, politics and most importantly religion. Some scenes to watch out for would be of Brian dropping a gourd and a shoe, his followers absurdly split into two groups, each worshipping a different relic - a hilarious take on the multi sectarian worshipping practices existing today or Brian uttering some gibberish to a crowd out of fear wrapped in some enigma that makes a blind mob follow him as the next prophet. That said and done my favorite part of the movie would be the blatantly original caricature of left-wing resistance groups with their endless subgroups, internal politics, conflicting agendas and vain ideology / speech without any results (ala Sankaradi in Sandesam!). Quite understandably, this flick was banned in many a European country until recent times for the supposedly sacrilegious take on religion (unsurprising with so with many parts parodying nativity, crucifixion et al). However on close watch, it never makes fun of Jesus - but it does thwart the blind, fanatic followers of any political movement or religion in a quite comical fashion. A controversial piece of comedy - a remainder to the critics that banning movies or cutting movie scenes based on religious pretexts exists in Hollywood / British movies as well as early as 1979, and is not limited to the Asian market of Viswaroopam, Padmavat etc.",

Phrases like conjugate the verb don't lose their appeal. Watching it with fresh eyes, the film has a pace to it which never falters. The perfection in the acting, for example Palin's hopping walk whilst begging, just sublime. Again Palin steals the show with his speech impediment, its not so much the speech , but the way he glances at the guards, make the scene work on a higher level than it first appears.

In Life of Brian, the comedians go after the one institution that has always had trouble accepting satire: religion, specifically the Christian Church. Seen as blasphemous, Life of Brian needed an eleventh hour rescue for Beatle George Harrison to finish the film. The church was wise to wonder what the Pythons were doing. Life of Brian is filled with questions of the role of religion in society, why people often feel they need religion, and the age old question of ""What would happen if the 3 wise men went to the wrong stable on that night they brought gifts to the young savior?"" There is typical Python silliness throughout the movie, set up early where listeners at one of Jesus' sermons (held at ""tea time,"" of course) think they hear that ""blessed are the cheese makers."" But the most important part of this film, and it's charm, are the questions of religion. No matter your faith, you will find scenes in Life of Brian unsettling, provocative, and humorous, possibly all three at once. While not wall-to-wall as funny as Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Life of Brian is a humorous look at civilization's oldest and dearest institutions, and asks us to consider what we are doing.",

Written by the six members of the Monty Python troupe (who collectively play forty roles), the humour is hit-and-miss as per the troupe's norm. There is nothing especially funny about Terry Jones in drag, the lisping of Michael Palin as Pontius Pilate goes on for far too long and other parts are simply silly (mentally handicapped jailer). The jokes that do work are admittedly excellent though. A lesson on how to haggle is a particular highlight, same goes for a stoning scene in which all participants are actually women in disguise, plus the politics of the various rebel factions in Judea are great. The second half of the movie also works better than the buildup to it as the title character finds himself unable to rid himself of followers mistaking him for their saviour and no matter what he says, he cannot get them to change their view. The film is also topped off with the most memorable ending of all four Monty Python movies with its celebration of optimism in the face of adversity.",

This is in comparison with the Holy Grail's beats which mostly depend on instant laughter with shorter builds, being more practical even in the dialog part jokes. Life of Brian offers the jokes more intelligently built with enough build up time that makes the laughs even more logical and relate-able.

I know it was lambasted as sacrilegious by the Christian Right, and the Jewish Right too (for its cynical treatment of the Judean resistance groups), but those people never did have any sense of humor. In fact there's no disrespect shown to the teachings of anybody's religion. I lived not far from the ""mount"" of the Sermon on the Mount (in America it would be only a ""hill""), and the scene of onlookers at the back of the crowd not quite able to hear, and having their own personal encounters, just fits the actual layout perfectly.

Graham Chapman is in top form as the beleaguered would be rebel Brian, and later on as Biggus Dickus. John Cleese is unforgettable too as both PFJ (or was it JPF?) leader Reg and the Roman centurion and the Jewish official at the stoning. Michael Palin's lampooning of the controversial figure of Pontius Pilate was simply hilarious and in fact not too inaccurate, take away the speech impediment and you have a ruthless governor, which most historians agree that's what the real Pilate was. Eric Idle, in my opinion was probably the funniest of all, ""Oh shut up big nose"" ""I want you all to call me Loreta"" ""He's deee he's deee he's deeaffff and mamama mad sir"" had me in tears, also Terry Jones as Brian's overbearing mother was simply outstanding Terry Gilliam's role was one of the smaller ones as he doesn't appear as much but he also does well in the roles he plays. so all in all the acting was perfect for this type of movie. Now onto the elephant in the room, does this movie lampoon Christ or insult religion, well no it doesn't as Kenneth Colley plays the small role of Jesus Christ straight and respectfully so it doesn't mock him and Brian isn't a metaphor or representation of him as its established early on that they're two different people. If anything it lampoons the time period that the movie was set and the one historical figure who is directly lampooned was Pontius Pilate. The movie ends on an upbeat note which is appropriate for a comedy like this, all in all you have funny jokes, witty and memorable dialogue and an ending which will leave you feeling glad you watched it. 10/10",

Brian just happens to be born in the stable next to Jesus and gained accidental recognition for a revolution against the Romans. Christians may find this content disturbing however it is difficult not to laugh at the hysterical viewpoint of Monty Python. Brian is thrown into a life of complete misunderstanding until he is hanging on a cross joining others in the singing of ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life."" Directed by fellow Python Terry Jones in mock documentary style. Graham Chapman plays off the anguish and confusion of Brian who only wishes to be left alone. Michael Palin plays Pontius Pilate who is mocked with regards to his speech impairment. Eric Idle plays a criminal who relishes the idea of being crucified and even leads the vocals in the famous concluding sing-along. John Cleese leads the revolutionary group that harasses Brian and ultimately lead him into trouble. Jones provides the shrieking demeanor of mother who informs a mob that her son has been ""a very naughty boy!"" Terry Gilliam handles the visual appeal particularly the noted title sequence. Controversial satire of the misinterpretations of the disciples of Jesus but Jesus came to deliver mankind from a fate that even Brian would dread. Score: 9 / 10",

After the success of the Python's last movie which at the time was Monty Python and the Holy Grail, he had been asked what their next feature would be with which he flippantly responded with Jesus Christ - Lust for Glory. Who would have thought that such an offhand quip would eventually lead to their most celebrated and critically praised works being brought to the cinema theaters. At least those which were brave enough to screen it given the immediate controversy that was to follow. Shrewdly however they chose not to actually focus on lampooning Jesus himself, as they felt there was nothing funny about his life and subsequent death. Any attempts at humour at his expense would have seemed shallow and taking mere potshots. However they set their sights on organized religion which the team had a combined mistrust of.

There's an awful lot of shouting, sometimes all at once from extras, and even with subtitles it's difficult to follow along. I'm sure there's some quality writing buried somewhere under all the noise and chaos, but parsing it from the subtitles to the action seems like work instead of entertainment.

Some of Monty Python's humor comes through, but it doesn't seem to work too well in this setting.  I think that if it wasn't in reference to Jesus Christ they could have made this movie funny.  The movie itself does not make fun of christians or Jesus but rather things in the time like stonings, lepers, and the Romans.

Story is (if you care, because its not about that) a boy is born to a man dressed up as a woman who shrieks all the time and gets on your nerves till they are stretched to the limits. As a matter of fact most of the characters in this movie squeal a lot to the effect that I almost thought that this is a move about pigs disguised as humans. So yeah Brian is born to a man dressed up as a woman on the same day as Christ in a stable adjacent to the stable where Christ is born. And Jesus Christ does it get worse from there. He grows up to hate the Romans and joins a group of liberalists who are plotting against the Romans. From there on Brian finds himself at the wrong place and the wrong time usually to eventually become a messiah of sorts to eventually be strung up for crucifixion to eventually sing his way into the sunset.

Christianity is a soft target.And this movie does lampoon Christianity despite the clever - clever Oxbridge sophistry employed by Cleese and Co. to the contrary.I don't have a problem with that per se,my problem is that the makers lacked the courage to admit it.Surely a group as daring and innovative as the Pythons should have the balls to say ""yes,this is a movie that takes the pxss out of Christianity - and we don't care"". I went to see ""The Life of Brian"" in the West End with a group of middle - aged schoolteachers and social workers all of whom were determined to demonstrate how unoffended they were by guffawing heartily at the drop of a hat.There was no one under 30 in the audience,perhaps an indication that the Pythons' appeal was to a demographic that found their humour familiar from years of being subjected to it from the original sources i.e. The Goon Show,Round the Horne,Marty Feldman and of course the great Spike Milligan who surely must have felt just a little rueful at accepting a small part in the movie that would never have existed had he not more or less single - handedly invented surreal radio thirty years earlier. Yes it is a funny movie,and I did laugh a lot,but daring and original it most certainly isn't.""Carry on Cleo"" was funnier without the pretension and the faux daring. It is probably becoming clear that I am not a particular admirer of Pythonesque (the very word sends a shudder up my spine) humour. To me the whole group seem like smug,sniggering,cocky overgrown schoolboys who have been told how clever they are for so long that they have - for years -believed in their own publicity.Occasionally,one - like Michael Palin - will make a genuine effort to do something completely different(to coin a phrase) but even he cannot resist referring to his time with The Organisation on a regular basis. Terry Gilliam,perhaps the most talented of them all,broke free to make ""The Twelve Monkeys"",one of the most dazzling of all 1990s movies,a creation of real daring and panache. If the boys really want to be brave and outrageous perhaps they should consider making ""The Life of Mohamed"" but I really don't think they will,do you?",

Life of Brian on the other hand is extremely watchable and quite funny for the Monty Python crew where the humour still isn't the sharpest but it doesn't need to be. My favourite part has to be when Brian is being took away by the Roman soldiers and Judith starts to smack the back of John Cleese's Roman centurion character and her final smack knocks his helmet crooked and he turns round and says ""stop it"" but it was the way he said it which had be laughing my head off! Just little things like that which makes this the best Python movie. Graham Chapman as Brian is great as he plays his charachter in a similar way as he did Arthur in Holy Grail (being funny by being serious), shame he died a while back as he is one of my favourite Pythons. Has to be admired for its originality and i think Life Of Brian is for anyone and yeah the song at the end 'Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life' is a nice way from stopping the movie having a tragic end which would have been a terrible thing for a comedy spoof flick but the song is annoying so why they released it into the British pop charts in the early 90's is beyond me even though Eric Idle's performance on Top Of The Pops was funny.

It's not like I was dying of laughter the entire time but that's the point. It's not just joke after joke with this one.

Later, when Brian (Graham Chapman) has grown, he is only known as a stadium snack seller, but it is there that he meets and joins the Peoples' Front of Judea, who do nothing, but really hate the Romans. Later, after carrying out a job for them, and escaping from lisping Pontius Pilate (Michael Palin) (""Welease Wodewick""), he says wise words to some pilgrims on the streets. It is after this that suddenly people start following him, believing he is the Messiah. The film concludes with the controversial crucifixion of Brian, and many other characters. Also starring John Cleese in many of the cooperative roles, Chapman also playing some small roles including lisping Biggus Dickus (""Thomething I Thaid?""), Terry Gilliam playing ugly cooperatives, Eric Idle playing cheerful, questioning and reasoning roles, Terry Jones as the Pepperpot mother of Brian and other smaller roles, Palin takes quite a lot of the supporting roles, Sue Jones-Davies as Judith, and a cameo by Spike Milligan. The highlights for me are Brian opening the window (naked) to a crowd, and his mother says ""He is not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy"", and Idle asks ""Are you a virgin"", and of course, the great end to the film with the song by Idle, number 6 on 50 Greatest One Hit Wonders, ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"". It may have been controversial at the time, but it is now no match for The Passion of the Christ. John Cleese was number 14 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, John Cleese was number 14 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Eric Idle was number 21, and Cleese number 2 on The Comedians' Comedian, the film was number 13 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments, it was number 1 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and it was number 23 on The 100 Greatest Films.

Perhaps the least-funny of all characters is Brian himself, but even here, Chapman's acting is superb in playing the straight man for all the jokes (which must have been tough for him!). Blasphemy? Don't be ridiculous. Even the most dogmatic would see that the movie does not poke fun at Christ; rather, it pokes fun at all of us who follow blindly, regardless of the contrary evidence put before us.",

155,11 January 2007,de_niro_2001,5, What was all the fuss about- it's an Almighty Laugh!,"I'm not a Python fan but I thought this film was hilarious. I am also a communicating member of the Church of Scotland and attend church fairly regularly. I might point out that I have heard a minister make mention of this film in his sermon and he was not condemning it. Even now, supporters of this film have to keep on driving home the point that this film is NOT about Jesus. Yes, Jesus does appear and is portrayed reverentially in the film (what the Pythons say about not being afraid of the blasphemy laws is a load of big talk). The laughs come thick and fast. If mishearing Jesus's words as ""Blessed are the cheesemakers"" is blasphemous then schoolchildren all over the world commit blasphemy when they sing ""Dance then, wherever you may be. I am the Lord of the Dance Settee"". If creating a fictional character whose life runs parallel to that of Jesus is blasphemous then Lew Wallace committed a blasphemy when he wrote Ben Hur. In a recent Channel 4 documentary about the film Polly Toynbee said there is a great humour vacumn at the heart of religion. It's true. The way some religious groups got so hot under their clerical collars about it takes your breath away. When the film opened in Glasgow, the late Pastor Jack Glass, well known arch enemy of Billy Connolly, presented the cinema manager with four nails. Glass told the manager this was because he was crucifying Jesus all over again. Much as he would have disliked it,Glass had a few things in common with Billy Connolly. Both came from a Glaswegian working class background, both had beards and expressed their strongly held views irrespective of what other people thought. Glass also had a bit of a knack for making people laugh although unlike Billy Connolly this was not intentional. Most of the religious nuts who opposed and continue to oppose this film have never seen it but these people aren't noted for their broad mindedness. Some have seen it and probably would have sat their scowling and not laughing as it was what they saw as their Christian duty. But frankly, it's very hard to sit through this film and not laugh. Brian's ride in the spaceship is hilarious. There are also some brilliant lines in the film. Come on, you religious fanatics. Get a life. Have a laugh. Your faith must be very flimsy if it is harmed by a film that is just meant as a joke.",

Scene after scene, the whole film is a cascade of humor of the best, finest quality. For me, the funniest scenes are: with the Roman soldiers who can't help but laugh when Pilate pronounces a certain name that I will reveal later, when the two jailers, one of whom stutters and the other deaf, start talking and hearing normally, when Pilate struggles to find a person condemned to crucifixion to forgive and, when the

Though it might not be as immediately gratifying as its peers, I've come to appreciate ""Brian"" as the Pythons' best-written picture over the years, with a razor-sharp wit playing excellently alongside the requisite amounts of lunacy and brow-furrowing topics of conversation. And, though it's clearly a product of the late '70s in many ways, its not-so-subtle warnings against blind faith in any organization (or the men at the helm) is still very relevant in today's world.

This is perhaps the defining one.,"""Life of Brian"" is a British comedy movie from 1979 and the most known effort most likely by the comedy troup Monty Python. Do I even need to say that? I think everybody knows. Anyway, this one has its 40th anniversary now and on that occasion, even if some devout Christians may not have liked it, especially for the Easter holidays, it returned to theaters again and yesterday I was lucky enough to be in a viewing. The director is Terry Jones and he is also one of the many writers. I will spare you most of the names, but of course Terry Gilliam, a really successful filmmaker in his own right, deserves a mention too and he is also acting in here obviously. I would also like to mention John Cleese, who probably gave my favorite performance from everybody in here, and he was just great fun and had amazing screen presence and he was also more handsome than I thought and I am writing this as a heterosexual male. Fittingly, back then that was half his life as he turns 80 later this year. The main character is played by Graham Chapman, who was perhaps the unluckiest from the Monty Python bunch as he died relatively early from cancer. And while some are dead, others managed great careers, including Oscar nominations, like Cleese. There were also some that ended up forgotten mostly like the Judith actress.

They are stuffed so full of self-righteous piety and bumptious arrogance, that they are themselves the best comedic subject, just ripe for lampooning.",
211,8 January 2008,guybishopp,9, Best Python by far,"The most hilarious film I have ever seen. It is funnier then some of the comedies we watch in todays day and age. I laughed throughout the entire film, especially at the line ""He's not the Masiah he's a very naughty boy"". All the characters are funny in their own different way. Like I say in the title this is the best Python by far, even over the holy grail and that also had me in stitches. The best scene is when Brian looks out of his window and sees this big crowd waiting for him because they think he is the Masiah even though he keeps saying he isn't. If there was a DVD boxset with the title best of British films this will definitely be in the collection hands down.",
212,17 March 2007,RiffRaffMcKinley,10," ""Holy Grail"" Part Two-- Another Python Triumph!","Monty Python's ridiculously offensive ""Life of Brian"" ranks definitely as one of the ten best comedies ever made. It's a good life for them, with their ""Holy Grail"" occupying another of those spots. In reality, if you're easily offended-- well, who are you kidding? You shouldn't be watching Monty Python anyway! But Graham Chapman and the gang-- particularly Terry Jones and John Cleese, as well as Chapman-- turn in what is perhaps their best work of all time (including non-Python fare), delivering cutting satire, piercing wit, and outta-here sight gags that would make any slapstick aficionado cry tears of joy. Perhaps the funniest and most under-appreciated bit of all in this film is Michael Palin's magnificent ""Crucifixion Line"": ""line on the left, one cross each, thank you."" One line like ""No one stones anyone till I blow this whistle"" and even the Killer Rabbit seems dated.",
213,1 February 2019,shakercoola,7, Lampoon of public ministry and religious attitudes,"A British comedy film; A story about Roman-occupied Judea and a man who joins a revolutionary movement. His efforts to overthrow the established order are complicated when he is repeatedly mistaken for the Messiah, becoming a reluctant figure of worship. It's a shambling story with some very funny juvenile gags. The London accented vernacular of the characters in particular makes the subject matter wacky and funny. As an aside, the story set against a historical background of ancient Galilee, was seen as a comedy taboo and even blasphemous by some religious groups when it was released.",

No one I can think of that can say this is not the best in the money Python series",
215,10 May 2002,Howlin Wolf,9, Contains moments of inspired lunacy...,"Don't let the more fanatical Python acolytes fool you that the duration of ""Life of Brian"" is ALL tea and biscuits, but it's certainly a more ORGANISED affair than ""Holy Grail"", and, like that film, contains some truly ingenious moments.  I have the nagging feeling that the production values were perhaps TOO good on this one, though, as such lending the film an inappropriately solemn feel even as you're doubling up on the floor laughing at one of the team's astute observations.  I suspect if the Pythons were at their peak today, the resulting 'spoof' would have been much sharper and less gentle.",
216,26 September 2016,miguelneto-74936,10, the best comedy already made.,"Life of Brian is simply the best comedy already made after the British group has made great Monty Python and the Holy Grail, they excel and do incredible Life of Brian, even the film mess with religion, and pass the time of Jesus Christ, in the moments that Christ appears, they respect, and no moments make fun of Jesus, and it was great, the direction is excellent, has scenes hilarious, such as Pontius Pilate, or stoning which is very funny, the final scene is amazing, the cast is spectacular, Graham Chapman this excellent, Terry Gilliam this great John Cleese excellent, Michael Palin was what but made me to laugh, Eric Idle great, Terry Jones also this great, the script is good, one of the best already done, Life of Brian is my favorite comedy, highly recommend it, and remember Always look the Bright Side of Life. Note 10",
217,3 October 2020,stimpy_tr,5, Too local a humour!,Am I the only one that didn't enjoy the movie? I think the British humour is too local and too cold to entertain globally. The movie is outdated and not funny at all.,
218,5 May 2009,OldAle1,9, Always look on the silly side of belief,"Three wise men wend their way to a small hut in a small town, 2000 years ago. They are in search of the Messiah and they come bearing gifts...but first they make a small mistake and deliver them to He who is not the Savior, Brian, who happens to be born on the same day, just down the alley from that Jesus fella. Brian grows up a fairly oblivious and apolitical mama's boy, though with less interesting in stonings than is usual. Alas, events lead him to work with the People's Front of Judea, the attempted kidnapping of Pilate's wife, accidental prophet-hood, and eventual crucifixion to the tune of ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life."" The conventional wisdom on 'Life of Brian' is that it's the Python crew's most ""polished"" or ""competent"" film as a team, and I'd probably agree with that, though I find 'Holy Grail' funnier. It's still scatter-shot and somewhat inconsistent of course - I for one found the whole Pilate/Biggus Dickus thing a bit overlong, and the alien abduction while fun doesn't really add anything besides giving Terry Gilliam more to do - but it does actually feel like a moderately cohesive film, and of course it takes the typical Python over-the-top methods on attacking organized religion to a point which all but the most humor-challenged Christians ought to be able to admit to at least chuckling over - it's a bit more pointed and narrow in its humor. Of course, the film isn't really anti-Christian, or anti-Jewish, but rather anti-stupid. Maybe that was it's biggest problem....",
219,16 November 2015,Enderman887,10, One of the funniest movies of all time,This movie is a masterpiece it is a brilliant satire. A outrageous comedy. A well acted movie one of the funniest films of all time. This is my favorite out of the three Python films. If you like comedy this is a movie you have to see. Brilliant the second funniest British film of all time the funniest being death at a funeral third being a fish called Wanda 4th being holy grail and 5th being in Bruges which is also a very good crime movie as well as black comedy. Anyways I'm getting side traced. The life of Brian is one of the greatest movies of all time. I loved every frame of it. Even if you are a Christian you will still enjoy this movie because it is just that funny. It's almost funny the same way South Park bigger longer and uncut of tropic thunder are funny ( 2 of the funniest American films ) this is so amazing if you like humid you will love this. If you hate comedy you will love comedy after watching this movie .,
220,11 June 2001,riversol,6, Not their best,"I bit disappointed especially since I am a Brian myself.  The religious satire does not go far enough. Some chuckle scenes, but only the closing song Look on the Bright Side of Life is thoroughly worthy of Monty's stamp.",
221,19 February 2021,someokiedude,10, One of Python's Best,"While I still prefer Holy Grail and find that it's Python at their silliest, I find that Life of Brian is Python at their most profound. Life of Brian is also different from Holy Grail and The Meaning of Life, as it has a more cohesive narrative than the other two. Perhaps one could make the argument that Holy Grail has a narrative as well, but I'd say that Grail's narrative is pretty loose, not that it's a bad thing, considering Holy Grail is my favorite of the Python films. But I find that Life of Brian achieves a sense of solidarity that the other two don't have, though of course with Python's signature oddball comedy thrown in for good measure.",
222,2 June 2018,topmandrake,9, Still valuable comedy!,"It's been decades since the last's viewing of The Life of Brian, and it is just as funny today. Is also interesting to think that this may be more socially relevant today than I was in 1979!",

This is classic Python, funny from first to last, and often hysterically so. It's probably the most seamless of their films, and displays an intelligence quite rare in comedy.",
226,30 April 2006,stefj3,10, Nothing is sacred,Absolutely one of the best comedies of all time. The Python cast puts it all out there for you to enjoy.,
227,6 March 2001,thehumanduvet,9, Classic scandal-mongering from the Pythons,"An awesome achievement from the Monty Python team, creating a biting yet hilarious satire on religion and politics and getting exactly the response hoped for - the film was condemned by godbotherers at the time as blaspheming the life of Christ, when in fact it is quite respectful towards the actual story of Jesus, but uses the life of an ordinary man living in the same time and place to lambast religion as a whole. Right-wing christianity thereby condemned itself as reactionary and unable to take any hint of criticism without the cries of 'Unbeliever!?Persecute him!' that greet the first critic of the fledgling Brian religion in the film. The Life of Brian is a plea for tolerance and common sense in all things, and although religion is its main target, it hits on many other human failings, particularly in politics and bureaucracy, without ever losing sight of the fact that it is above all a comedy. Packed with visual and verbal hilarity in the best Python style, and carrying a vital message that people should think for themselves and not take things too seriously, this is a great and important film which could, if enough people watched it properly, and took in what it has to say without mindlessly condemning, make the world a kinder and happier place. Damn funny too.",

229,15 March 2002,Captain Ed,9, Brilliant -- the best of Python,"From concept to execution, this qualifies as the best of the Python films. It features a solid plot structure and many hilarious and memorable set pieces, such as The Stoning, The PFJ vs the JPF, etc, that previous comments have specified.  There are still some slow spots, and a ridiculous interlude with an alien ship that almost screams that they needed to pad the movie out for length; these detract slightly from the overall product, but it's a worthy addition to your DVD or video collection.",
230,1 February 1999,jll,8, Monty Python's Best Film,"Actually, this is Monty Python's only film in the sense that it, unlike ""Holy Grail"" and ""Meaning of Life"", has a continuous story and persistent characters.  What also raises this film above the afore-mentioned two is its brilliant (and quite wicked) humor.  The scene where Brian paints anti-Roman slogans on a wall and ends up getting an impromptu Latin lesson (at the point of a sword, no less!) is, well, what can I say, a moment of comedic genius.",
231,15 October 2022,eagandersongil,8, for over 40 years being current and funny,"Praising Monty Python is a cliché, but it's amazing how funny, current, critical and sarcastic his humor is ""The Life of Brian"" is over 40 years old and remains an extremely up-to-date work, both in its humor and in its message, with a impeccable direction, a text that wanders between allegories and criticism, extremely original and unique production design details, such as its soundtrack, costumes, set elements and even its quick editing -very characteristic of English humor cinema-, in addition to the great and comical performances. Not to say that ""Brian's Life"" is perfect, I feel an unnecessary lengthening of the second act, which breaks the rhythm a little, but that doesn't harm the work so much. 8.5/10.",

Much less an attack on spirituality or even Jesus Christ than on small-minded religious bigotry, Life Of Brian emerged to charges of blasphemy from small-minded religious bigots - and joyous, life-affirming waves of laughter from everybody else: the Surgeon General should prescribe this film as an additional compound in the treatment of depression.

237,5 August 2014,greenf74,1, Foul,"Whenever I say this film revolted me, people look knowingly, or smugly, or even pityingly at me, and say, ah, it offended your religious beliefs, you thought it blasphemy. No, I say, I don't have any religious beliefs and it was something far worse than blasphemous. It was inhuman. For the record, this film is a blatant and obvious con-trick, and was always meant to be that. By making schoolboy jokes about supposed Christianity, and the clichés of Biblical epic movies, the Monty Python gang could pretend that they were being terribly daring, that they were prepared to risk their reputations by taking on the might of the Church. They did nothing of the sort. The jokes are just stupid, and often very nasty, demeaning to common humanity; they're not in the least satirical or brave or savage. They're also not funny. But, because jokes about religious matters were uncommon in dumb comedies in 1979, the brain-dead idolaters of the team could tell themselves that it was real cutting-edge stuff, and then the Pythons could add to their unmerited lustre by pretending they were somehow ""more than merely funny"". More than funny? Come off it. I smiled momentarily maybe four times, mostly thanks to the uncredited Spike Milligan, who, in a few seconds of screen-time, was better value than the whole of the rest of the cast. The film reeks of contempt for its own fans; you will find this hilarious, it commands us, because we tell you it is, and you will be grateful that we have condescended to entertain you. It is, in fact, vulgar swill which cheapens us all, and its admirers should be ashamed of themselves.",
238,26 November 2021,melwinbauer,4, Always look on the bright side of life,Monty Python's Life of Brian is significantly worse than it's predecessor Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Even with a couple of hilarious scenes it still disappoints. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a far superior movie.,
239,14 April 2004,halloweenbikini,8, The best of the Python Movies,"Look, I can't say I'm a big Python fan, but of all the movies they have made I find this to be the one with the most heart. Some of the set ups and jokes might not be as funny as those in some of the other films, but it is the most cohesive in terms of plot, theme and political content. Also, the performances are outstanding. And while most of the other endings of the other films feel like an anticlimax, the ending of ""Brian"" left me with a smile on my face and extremely satisfied. It's a pity that this film still courts controversy, it's message is a valid one and not executed in a cruel or unfair manner. And bear in mind, it's still funny in it's ridiculousness. I loved every minute of it and regret that there will be no more Python movies.",
240,1 September 2004,Ferdinand_the_Barbarian,10, Blasphemous? I think not.,"Life of Brian is, undoubtedly, the best religious satire I have ever laid eyes on. It's authentic, has good acting, and is biting in its commentary. It rivals some of the great parody work of Mel Brooks for the greatest comedy of all time (Young Frankenstein may trump Life of Brian). And this comes from somebody who is a Christian, and holds to a very strict interpretation of the Bible. Maybe, though, that's why it's so funny.",
241,9 November 2002,OttoVonB,10, This Will Make You A Better Person!,"Monty Python are the grand masters of silliness, something they have elevated to an art over the course of numerous skits, shows and now a second feature film.

Stonings, blasphemy, Roman leaders with speech impediments, it's all here with absolute historical accuracy. It's goofy, it's absurd, it's hilarious at times and gets better each time you watch it. When I first saw this years ago I thought it was a let-down compared to ""The Holy Grail"" and ""The Meaning of Life"" (also by the Python gang), mostly because my college roommate used to get drunk and recite lines from it before I had ever watched it, so when the funny parts came, I already knew them. But with each viewing since I've enjoyed it more even though I still know when they're coming. After you've carved out your heart with a pitchfork this Easter season by watching ""The Passion of the Christ"", watch this for a little levity and reclamation of your soul.

But the ending ruined it.
I don't see how showing people abandoning you in your time of need and leaving you to die is meant to be funny.
I find it disgusting that it is shown as comedy. I know the movie isn't meant to be taken seriously, but that stuff at the end shouldn't be used to make people laugh!

It is so ahead of its time that it makes uncomfortable viewing for many of today's viewers. It tackles many subjects from religious intolerance to gender transience. Watching it today it is as funny and even more pertinent than when it was first shown and banned all those years ago. I'm glad that it still upsets some people, whose unyielding views on life are otherwise feted. To me it symbolises rebellion against societal norms, which unfortunately has been knocked out of many of today's populace. I love it and will continue to watch it over and over again.",

Besides that, I think ""Life Of Brian"" is more blasphemous than funny.  I got about 2/3 of the way through the film when it started going downhill.  By the end of the film, I was glad it was over.  Jesus Christ is the most revered person in all of human history and it is hard for me to watch a parody of his life.  The men of Monty Python made a somewhat funny film but it wasn't as funny as ""Holy Grail"".  Besides being shocked by the entire film, I also realize there are much worse films out there.  Overall, this is a pretty daring work by the famous comedy troupe as blasphemous as it was despite it not being their intention for the film.  I give it an 8 out of 10.",

I have to admit that I still like ""Holy Grail"" the most from the Monty Python movies. I didn't like ""The Meaning of Life"" so much and I think it's the worst one of the three movies, though it isn't that bad after all. The story tells about..

Probably the most coherent of all the Python films, the film centres upon the unfortunate Brian, born in the stable next door to Jesus, who is burdened with a ridiculous mother (""he's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!""), an large nose and a crowd of people who believe is the Messiah. One of my favourite films of all time because it contains side splitting scenes such as the Pontius Pilot scene in which Pilot discusses his friend Bigus Diccus and his wife Incontinentia Buttocks. This humour is not sophisticated, but schoolboy humour is exactly what's expected of Monty Python isn't it? I originally saw it because I heard it had been controversial with the Christian right, this is the same reason I watched Jerry Springer the opera and read the Da Vinci code, and I can easily see why. Some of the scenes could cause offence but they aren't meant to and they are extremely funny.

Its done with a sarcastic wit and in good fun. I've showed this film to many of my friends, some of whom are very religious, but they all seemed to think it a riot!

My father also watched them with me and he always looked blank at the TV screen and probably wondered why I was rolling about the floor in fits of laughter. Of the people I have come across over the years who have seen the film they drop into two distinct groups the lovers and the 'just isn't funny' group. I genuinely cannot recall anybody saying it was a bad film and perhaps more relevant cannot recall anyone upset by the so called blasphemy. I am not interested in the acting or lighting or the other ingredients that go to make up the film.

One thing that also brings it down is the fact that so many religious people are ranting about how it's ""an affront to God"" or ""It's sacrilege and ""Monty Python is an agent from Satan"" etc. I didn't see any of that in the movie. The Sermon on the Mount scene or the line ""He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!"" may be a little touchy to some people but that's it. The rest of the movie is not funny at all. The ""we're supposed to haggle!"" scene is funny and the ""Always look on the Bright Side of Life"" music number is great but that's it.

I watched Ben Hur the whole way through for the first time the other day, and the only thing that made it's turgid portents bearable was picturing Charlton Heston asking ""what have the Romans ever done for us?"" The big irony is that in spite of deliberately placing modern characters and attitudes into a historical setting for the sake of comedy, Life of Brian is in many ways the more historically sensitive film. Ben Hur is typical Hollywood history, turning the Judeans into proto-liberal nationalists on a quest for freedom from oppression every bit as anachronistic and spurious as that of Mel Gibson's William Wallace. At least Braveheart has only the single-whammy of glib, historically insensitive, self-congratulatory, judgemental retrospect.

Even the most religious or political person alive can't deny that this topic is as relevant today as it was when the film was first made. This world is full of fanatics. The movie is full of the gang's usual, well-argued fallacies. The Pythons really did their homework on this one. They make a complete mockery of serious geographical, religious and historical events and customs. According to Monty Python's history, many rejected Jesus as the Messiah because Brian was born in the stable next door. That's only the beginning of the confusion. Pontius Pilate has a speech impediment, Roman gladiatorial events have a children's matinée, Roman soldiers are Latin professors, and terrorists wanting to be freed from Roman bondage can't agree on why they hate Rome in the first place.

How could Jesus speak to the multitudes? And of course, what part did Biggus Dickus play in the political history of Rome. After tackling the local Mythology of Briton with Holy Grail, the Pythons go after bigger game with the major mythology of western civilization.

A talented writing team bounced ideas off each other and fueled each other to really come up with a winner. The desert location filming really made this film, it would not have been the same on fake back-lot sets. The faith of George Harrison in the Python team ensured that adequate finance was put into the production. Our lives would not have been the same without the Life of Brian always there to watch again on a rainy Sunday afternoon with our feet up!",

The jokes are mostly intelligent and it's comments on religion should not be ignored.",
331,7 April 2021,incurableflame,5, Not to be THAT person but...,"I was disappointed at how many jokes in this film have been made at the expense of disabled people, with lisps and mental disabilities being the butt of the joke. Over and over again and drawn out. It's something a mean bully would do. I'm not sure what kind of person would think to make fun of a disability, regardless of whether the character is a Roman governor or a lowly servant (who were pretending the whole time anyway). Rape is also made fun of, which is really what propels the story forward and Brian's need to fight the Romans (which is fine on its own, but not the way the revelation is presented). I feel like at times the film was too eager to express its own political stance, which was unnecessary, and detracted from the film's inherent absurdity and juvenile humor. Aside from all of that, it was brilliant. It didn't age as well as you would expect though, which is the main problem with it, as I have described.",

Along the way, we are treated to aliens, complete breakdowns of communication (a favorite Python theme), i.e., ""Blessed are the cheesemakers..."", and, astoundingly, a hilarious lesson in Latin grammar!",

And: It is a brilliant outstanding satire on organised religion without hurting religious feelings of the audience. Oh yes, it would have been very easy to do some kind of a Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker-parody on classics as ""The 10 Commandments"" or ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"". But the Pythons never went that way, they invented their own vision of a sandal-opera in the time of Jesus Christ. With a Pythonesque Pilate, a friendly centurio organizing a crucification, an important roman called Biggus...erm, yes, you know, what I mean. And of course with one of the biggest songs ever in a comedy. So all please whistle now: ""Always look at the bright side of life...""",

This is the only truly complete Monty Python film - The Holy Grail, while having some achingly hilarious moments, never really hangs together and loses direction completely in the last quarter, while The Meaning of Life and And Now For Something Completely Different are both extended sketch shows.

354,1 July 1999,Slos,10, Widiculous Wibaldry,"This, my friends, is simply as good as it gets. Monty Python tear to pieces anything and everything in the name of humour; oh, MARVEL at the humour. In my opinion, no movie can match this for insight and intelligence [even Dr. Strangelove is left wanting] If you have half a brain and really listen to what is going on then you will appreciate the jokes. However, it is unlike the gang's T.V appearances and Grail; it is not completely without plot! This film rips to shreds all religion and the stupidity of rulers I think that you must be atheist to be able to stomach the message. If you can handle the deep end of humour then you surely have to watch, and concentrate on, this masterpiece. The late, great, Graham Chapman in his best ever role; he IS the greatest - a sadly overlooked talent who was much, much better than that Cleese fellow.",

That alone was one of my defining moments, when it really hit home how easy it is to get amazingly large numbers of people to do incredibly stupid things.  And that was BEFORE seeing the movie, which, in case you're still wondering, is more a satire on those folks picketing, instead of the J-man.

But I have to say the best scene is when John Cleese, as Centurion, stands at the door of the secret meeting place and converses w/ Mathias.  Mathias says Crucifiction isn't so bad, at least it gets you in the open air, and so then John Cleese says, ""Your weird!"" In the funniest way.

I was disappointed with ""The Meaning of Life"" and although ""The Holy Grail"" had some fantastically funny scenes, there was too much of their traditional silliness to keep me laughing all the way through.  ""Life of Brian"" is my favourite comedy film.  The humour is sarcastic, daring and consistent pretty much until the end.  There are very few films that can be watched repeatedly and still make you laugh out loud but this is one of them.  I'm disappointed more of my friends here (America) haven't seen it.

361,13 April 2004,s-d-janowski,10, One of the greatest comedies.,"Take a break from the gloom and doom of Gibson's ""Passion Of The Christ"". Lighten up a little and have some fun.  The first big scene after the credits is Brian and his Mother listening to Jesus' ""Sermon on the Mount"". So Brian is immediately identified as a poor slob of misunderstanding and circumstance.  In a documentary about the film, Eric Idle said they knew they can't really make fun of Christ, but it was just a unique opportunity to do comedy about a period of time that nobody ever thought of doing comedy on before.  So, before you kick your TV, run to your bible and curse the Monty Python guys.  Relax, grab a beer and remember to ""Always look on the bright side of Life"".",
362,14 November 2003,PythnFan84,10, This movie really isn't blasphemous when you look at it!!!,"As you know, when Life Of Brian came out in 79, there was a big hell storm of controversy and such, from churches and religious groups, shunning the ""anti-religious comedy"". And it is still looked down upon by religious groups to this day. OK, so there is a big musical number at the end of the movie involving people hanging on a bunch of crosses singing, but you will notice that in no way it makes fun of Jesus Christ. Crucifixion existed before Jesus did, so it's not fair to say that showing that scene is disrespecting Jesus Christ. It's all nonsense. And as for everything else in the movie, it's not like it's trying to say these events never really happened. Like at the very beginning of the film, the three wise men travel to Jerusalem to bring gifts to the virgin Mary's son, only they choose the wrong manger, the one next door to the infant Christ. Hmmm, no sign of any anti-religious message here. Or how about the scene when Jesus is giving the sermon on the mound, and a fight breaks out between two couples in the very back not being able to hear the message. Ummm, what's so bad about this??? The point that I am trying to make here is that this movie does not try to say these events never happened!!!!! Thank you.",

So, as I begun to watch it, in starting, I was like, ""okay, it seems like fun, but weird, I mean, WHAT!"", then I start to chuckle a bit, then soon I became like, ""OH MY GOD!"" ""OHHH MY GOOOD!"" and the movie just didn't give me a chance not to laugh. Everything was just so stupidly arranged, that you could never expect what next? And keep on wondering ""what the hell is going on""? But it doesn't matter what the hell is going on. It just keeps on happening in a direction-less direction. And you are bound to go with it.

So my step mom and I decided that it would be a good idea to go see it. We haven't laughed as much at a movie in the Theaters for a long time. I think overall it was better than Holy Grail because it wasn't as scatter shot and had a better ending. I personally thought the end in Holy Grail was the dumbest cop-out way to end a movie.
