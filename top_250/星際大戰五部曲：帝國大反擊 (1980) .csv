0,25 April 2016,ivo-cobra8,10," Excellent timeless classic, the best sequel of all time!","Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is an excellent timeless classic that it is the best sequel of all time. I love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the Star Wars franchise that I love. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels I can think of, it is right there with Aliens (1986), it is right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish The Empire as a value treat. Empire Strikes Back is still and excellent film which I really believe is a timeless classic. This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday.",/
1,16 January 2020,UniqueParticle,10, I enjoy this one more than A New Hope,"So much amazing action and beautiful cinematography makes for such an enlightening experience! In The Empire Strikes Back you know who everyone is which is great plus Yoda is introduced! I love this movie the music is soothing, there's romance, more of Darth Vader, and introduces Emperor Palpatine what more can you ask for? A lot to relish and get excited about; it's such a classic gem.",r
2,26 October 1999,Spleen,10, It's NOT the darkest of the trilogy - it's the most mature,"`It avoids having the standard shoot-'em-up ending,' says a friend of mine, `by not having an ending.'  I suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me.  I'm therefore inclined to think it DOES have an ending.  Obviously, I can't discuss this without giving things away to those few who don't know what happens.  If you're one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film.  Stop reading now.",e
3,6 August 2002,Anonymous_Maxine,10," Even though he wasn't at the director's helm this time, George Lucas has done it again.","In a film like The Empire Strikes Back, especially a few years on the heels of such a mind-bogglingly great film like the original Star Wars, there is something that comes immediately to mind that would at first seem to count against the film, but instead only winds up increasing the respect that it commands. In the 1977 Star Wars, there is a clear reliance on simplicity in some parts. Obviously, it is much more than a simply made science fiction film, but like I said in my review of it, there was a lot of highly effective reliance on things that were not put on screen, such as Obi Wan's description of The Force to Luke. In The Empire Strike Back, the first thing that we are treated to is the traditional scrolling text along a background of stars, depicting what has happened between the last film and this one, and reminding us of the things that were mentioned in the last film but never explained.",v

5,22 May 2005,TheNorthernMonkee,10, finest of the trilogy because Lucas didn't write the script,"SPOILERS Three years after ""Star Wars"", creator George Lucas released the second part of his trilogy. Giving scripting credits to Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasden, as well as directing to Irvin Kershner, Lucas made his smartest ever decision and as a result was able to release the finest film of the trilogy by a mile. Considerably darker and more mature than it's predecessor, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a masterpiece of modern film. It is an intense, powerful, entertaining film with the ultimate cinema twist and with a script worthy of it's potential.",e
6,29 November 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10," Manages to be even better than New Hope, and that was just as brilliant","The original trilogy of Star Wars contain three films, all of which are sophisticated, imaginative and enormous fun. I feared it wouldn't be my thing, but it was exactly that. I loved the original trilogy for all those reasons. Empire Strikes Back maintains all the fun of its predecessor, while even darker and more mature. Visually it's a marvel to look at, with the stunning special effects and highly imaginative-looking sets. John Williams's score is just outstanding, epic and monumental in every way. The story is darker than that of New Hope and perhaps more sophisticated, and I loved the fact the filmmakers made the romance between Leia and Han more developed. The battle sequences are mesmerising, the beginning is bound to have you on the edge of your seat, but the battle between Luke and Darth Vader was simply out of this world. The script is still as affectionate as ever, the pace is fast and the acting is great. Mark Hamill is ever as likable as Luke, and Carrie Fisher still has her spunk and vivacity. Harrison Ford is noticeably more subdued, but he is still terrific, and Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda. Chewabacca is hilarious, and Darth Vader is a fantastic villain, especially when voiced so magnificently by James Earl Jones. All in all, a perfect successor to an already brilliant first film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",w

The storyline picks up where Star Wars left off with the rebellion building their army and the evil Empire rebounding from losing the Death Star.

10,13 December 2015,claudio_carvalho,10, Fantastic Sequel,"The rebels' new base is hidden in the icy planet Hoth and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) commands a unit with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). During the investigation of a meteor crash, Luke is wounded and captured by a creature but succeeds to escape. While dying on the snow, he has a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi telling him to go to the Dagobah system to be trained by the Jedi Master Yoda. Later he is saved by Han and they are rescued in the morning by the rebels. Meanwhile Darth Vader (David Prowse) sends probe droids through the galaxy to find the location of the base. The rebels are located and they need to leave the planet under the attack of the Imperial Fleet. However Luke heads to Dagobah to find Yoda while Leia, Han, Chewbacca and C-3PO travel to the planet Bespin to meet his friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and repair the Millennium Falcon. However, they are betrayed by Lando and captured by Darth Vader. Meanwhile Luke has a premonition with his friends in danger and he decides to interrupt his training with Yoda to save them, despite the warning of Obi-Wan and Yoda. Will Luke be ready to face Darth Vader and save his friends? ",0
11,4 September 2022,nickenchuggets,10," ""It is your destiny""","It's obvious to most movie fans that Star Wars Episode IV deserves tons of praise for being the first in its respective series and also for spawning one of the biggest cultural phenomenons of all time, but in my view, The Empire Strikes Back is superior. I have seen someone state this already, but I will say it again here, as it is a very good reason why this movie is arguably better: character development. We get introduced to the main cast in A New Hope, but even by the end of that film, they're not fully fleshed out yet. We never really get to see how adept Luke is at using The Force, and Darth Vader, one of the most feared men in the galaxy, appears completely subservient to Peter Cushing's character, Grand Moff Tarkin. Episode V takes Star Wars in a risky direction, as Luke is separated from his friends for most of the runtime, but this decision totally paid off and I don't think the movie could have gone any better. The story picks up 3 whole years after Luke has destroyed the Death Star: the Empire's feared space station capable of obliterating entire planets. Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine, the two most powerful men in the Empire, send floating droids all over the galaxy to locate the secret base of the Rebel Alliance (the empire's enemy), under the command of Luke's sister Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Vader eventually finds what he's looking for and locates what looks like a stronghold on the frigid planet of Hoth. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is investigating an area around the rebel base and is attacked and nearly killed by a yeti-esque creature called a Wampa. Luke manages to slice off one of its arms with his lightsaber and is then rescued by Han Solo (Harrison Ford). Before being saved, Luke sees a vision of his late trainer, Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness) telling him to travel to a planet called Dagobah for some reason. Confident they have the rebel base in their sights, the Imperials launch a brutal onslaught on it using huge, walking, mechanized assault vehicles called AT AT's that decimate everything in their path. Luke and a few other rebels pilot rather slow spaceships known as snowspeeders in order to destroy the imperial walkers by tying their legs with tow cables and then blasting the weak armor on their neck joints. Despite their best efforts, the base is hit too hard and has to evacuate. Leia, Han, C-3PO, Chewbacca and R2D2 pile into the Millennium Falcon, Solo's rather mediocre but dependable starship, and fly off just as Vader enters the hangar. Luke doesn't regroup with his allies right away, and instead flies to the planet Dagobah as Obi-Wan's ghost told him to. Upon arriving in the planet's atmosphere, he loses control of his X-Wing and crashes into a swamp. Here, he meets Yoda, a centuries old Jedi Master who trains Luke in the way of the force. While Han and the others try to elude Vader's fleet of ships and star destroyers by weaving through asteroid fields, Luke expresses frustration at the difficulty of his training. He knows the force seems to be a magical aura of divine, supernatural energy that surrounds everything and inhabits all living beings, but he is not willing to put up with the time required to bend it to his will. Yoda makes things easier for him and uses his mastery over the force to easily lift Luke's crashed spaceship out of the swamp using only his mind. Luke quits his training early to pursue his friends to a planet called Bespin, since he can tell they're walking into a trap. Concurrently, Han Solo and the others arrive at Cloud City on bespin; a huge floating metropolis situated entirely in the sky. There, they meet Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), who is a no good smuggler (like Han) and an old acquaintance of his. While on cloud city, Lando reveals to the group that he's actually betrayed them to the empire. Vader, accompanied by the ruthless bounty hunter Boba Fett, take Han to a specialized chamber where he is frozen in carbonite so Boba can transport him to Jabba the Hutt for a reward. As the group (minus Solo) tries to fight their way out of cloud city, Luke comes face to face with Vader. Even with the force training he has received, Luke is no match for the dark lord's lightsaber proficiency and powerful strikes. Vader corners Luke, severs his hand, and reveals he is actually his father. Vader wants his son to join him so they can kill Palpatine together and end this galactic war, but Luke refuses and lets himself fall down a waste disposal chute that leads directly out of cloud city. Barely managing to hang on to a flimsy piece of metal, Leia senses something isn't right and flies underneath cloud city to rescue her brother. The ship jumps to hyperspace, slipping out of Vader's grasp once again. Back on a rebel medical ship, Luke receives an artificial right hand, and Lando promises to look for his friend Solo. Aside from the fact that this is a star wars movie, there are no doubt a ton of other reasons why it is worthy of adoration. Probably the most visually obvious reason are the special effects. Despite being over 4 decades old, this movie still looks great, and the effects will always look good no matter what year it is. The battle on hoth is amazing. We see the empire's enormous AT AT tanks, and how even their footsteps cause destruction. We see the millennium falcon get chased by massive, dagger shaped spaceships. Most of all, we see much appreciated character development. Luke still hasn't mastered all his force powers by the end of this movie, but he's come a long way thanks to Yoda. Speaking of which, Frank Oz did a great job puppeteering him and basically created one of cinema's most beloved characters. Even the villains are interesting and likable. Vader I believe needs no introduction, but he contrasts heavily with how he was in the first film. He's completely in control here and does what he wants, unlike in episode IV where Tarkin bosses him around, and episode VI where Palpatine does. While still a cool bad guy, it's always annoyed me how Boba Fett is consistently ranked as one of star wars' most popular characters, mostly just because of how he looks. He only has 4 lines in this entire movie, but he's still memorable for being one of the few people who can talk back to Vader and still be alive afterwards. It's not like I need to state the obvious, but John Williams' score really serves to make an epic film even more epic. All I have to say for my closing remark is that The Empire Strikes Back has clearly secured its place as one of the most well made star wars films, which should be common knowledge for any fan of this immortal franchise.",1
12,21 August 2018,morfunkel,10, Greatest Movie Ever,"This film changed the game forever. The people behind the scenes took an exciting science fiction adventure film with a happy tone where the heroes have a happy tone throughout and throwing that on its side. Throughout the film the rebels are in a constant rush and panic, pushing the viewers to the edge of their seat wondering if the heroes would make it to the end okay. This is done brilliantly by splitting up the heroes putting them in a worried state for one another. As well as that the rebels are all tested as they go through their own personal trails and try to find their way through.
Even though this might put you on a constant worry for the characters the movie is paced perfectly with breathers and amazing storytelling by the characters to fill in anything we need answers for.
That is just the story, the film also has gorgeous cinematography, going from the AT-ATs on Hoth, to the Imperial pursuit of the Falcon through the asteroid field, all the way down to the beautiful shots of the final battle in Cloud city. Even though we as viewers are worried for the rebels, the imagery is jaw dropping. 
The imagery is further enhanced by the most popular score of all time, John Williams delivers his best work ever as it has stuck with people their entire lives and is recognizable by even those who haven't seen the film. 
The film was released in 1980 and all of the set design and special effects still hold up to this day as they are just as convincing now as it was apon first watch for everyone in the past 38 years.",7
13,17 December 2004,Ithaqua1987,9, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,"An excellent sequel to Star Wars, this is easily the darkest and most serious out of all the Star Wars films, at least until Revenge of the Sith comes out. This movie benefits from the introduction of Yoda, a diminutive yet wise Jedi master who helps Luke prepare for his showdown with Darth Vader. It also introduces Lando Calrissian, Han's old gambling and smuggling buddy played very well by Billy Dee Williams. Empire is more character driven than the original and relies more on comic relief to help lighten the mood, but it doesn't go overboard with the humor. The story is more refined and the acting is better as well. Despite all of this I can't really say that I enjoyed Empire more than the original. The original Star Wars has a certain charm to it that none of the sequels (or prequels) have captured. I'd say that it is at least on par with the original though and is a fitting follow up in what is probably the greatest series of movies in the history of cinema.",5
14,3 March 2007,BA_Harrison,10, Why can't they make them like this any more?,"From it's opening scenes on the bleak ice-ball that is the planet Hoth, to its exciting finale on the cloud city of Bespin, The Empire Strikes back is a worthy sequel to the magnificent Star Wars.

17,7 July 2022,RonellSowes,10, Possibly The Best,"After the sensation that Star Wars was, it would seem impossible to make a worthy follow up but somehow Lucas and his team did. In fact, there's a strong argument to be made that Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back even surpassed its predecessor and is the best of the franchise/hexalogy. While I may not propound that myself, I couldn't exactly reject it either. All I can add is it does contain the best cinematography of all the films, courtesy of Peter Suschitzky.",/
18,20 November 2007,Dagobah_Man,10, Best of the best,"I cannot believe some people out there didn't like this film, yet claim to have enjoyed Episode One. No comparison whatsoever. ""The Empire Strike Back"" is George Lucas' best contribution to human history, and it will be remembered long after most other science fiction films have gone the way of the Do-Do Bird. The optical effects still stand the test of time, and the acting is superb. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher are all better than they we in the original Star Wars, having fully developed and grown into their characters, and the story just keeps going and going, from asteroid fields to swamp planets to cities in the sky, everything in this film works. So ignore anyone who claims to dislike it, and see it for yourself if you haven't already done so. 20 out of 10!!",?

Often times the second movie of a trilogy feels more like a step that was needed to reach the conclusion rather than an adventure of its own. Empire succeeded where so many others failed, even in the modern trilogies. The characters are further developed, the special effects are ground breaking and the universe in which this is based is rich.",f

The first was perfectly encapsulated by Aliens in the ""bigger is better"" school. You expand the stakes, scale, and number of character to create a bigger, bolder experience.

Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Anthony Daniels and Carrie Fisher are all incredible. James Earl Jones is even better as a more threatening and ruthless Darth Vader and Frank Oz is excellent as Yoda. Billy Dee Williams is a welcome addition in a effortlessly charismatic performance. John Williams' musical score is perfect once again. It's expertly paced and Irvin Kershner's direction is incredible. The action sequences are extremely thrilling and it has the best lightsaber fight in the franchise so far, in my opinion.

The fact that George Lucas did this movie on his own with his own money should tell you everything you need to know about how amazingly tenacious he is, not only that, he brought the characters to life..making them memorable, believable and most importantly relatable. Yes it's an old movie, yes it feels out dated...but trust me, if you look really past that and focus on its level of storytelling and the amazing writing of the story, you will understand why this movie has a rating of 8.7...most movies today and even in the last decade haven't even gotten close to that.

39,27 May 2007,blanbrn,10, Well Done. One of the best sci-fi films ever. It almost equals the 1977 original in terms of quality and popularity.,"Episode V ""The Empire Strikes Back"" released in 1980 in my opinion was a great sequel to the 1977 original. As far as quality it closely ranks to the original, and in terms of character development, and plot and as far as the storytelling goes it's probably better than the 1977 original. Directed this time around by Irvin Kershner he does just as good a job with the sets, characters, and special effects work as Lucas did making it just as good as 1977's. Here the saga now has a setting on the ice planet of Hoth, a place that the Rebels have hid from the evil empire in pursuit, with the real goal they have is to reach the fabulous city of Bespin nicknamed Cloud City for it's airy view. Here's when this installment becomes a real coming of age sequel in which the central character Luke Skywalker comes of age both in terms of skill and mind, and that's when he makes a stop in the swamp of Dagobah. It is in the swamps that hold an important part of the saga and the development of the Skywalker character is found here by training with the appearance of the Jedi master Yoda(hey, nice little green puppet!) as Luke's skill of mind and fighting ability is formed making one reason that Episode V is so important. Later a dark secret is revealed, by Darth Vader in the climax at cloud city, and it was just great to see the fierce battle between Luke and Vader to close out this installment. Overall ""The Empire Strikes Back"" might be the best of the saga in terms of the coming of age development of the central character(Luke). Also the plot finally reveals the hidden truth that's a very dark secret, and the introduction of a new and unique character(Yoda) holds the saga together just great. This really is just as good as the 1977 original simply because more key elements are shown and discovered, the only rule of law is I usually don't rank sequels over the original.",
40,15 February 2022,Tweetienator,9, Maybe the Best of Them All,"Every time I revisit the good old first trilogy I wonder: did Georg Lucas spend all this creativity on the first three movies or did he have some ghost writer or maybe he got the story dictated by a supernatural being? Without any doubt, those three first movies of the ST franchise are still and maybe for all eternity gems and milestones to the sci-fi genre, but almost everything else that was produced and published after Return of the Jedi is in comparison bad, really bad, with a very few exceptions (Rogue One was good). But maybe the saying even a blind hen sometimes finds a grain of corn just fits too well to Mr. Lucas. Anyway, he gave us these three epic movies, and for these treasures I am grateful in all eternity, and the rest I can just ignore. Amen.",
41,29 May 2016,filipemanuelneto,10, The saga thickens and matures,"This film is the continuation of the story of the first.

42,10 September 1998,up2u,10, My 8th favorite film of all time!,"This is my favorite of the classic Star Wars trilogy! It is the most suspenseful of the three and, as great as the other two are, they don't flow like this one does. This one explores the relationships instead of just action sequences (which are good in all three, though). The romance between Han and Leia and the one between Luke and Yoda, for example. This does have the best action sequence of the three of them, though; the lightsaber duel between Luke and Darth Vader. Pure brilliance!",

Here the rebellion is put on the back burner. This is less the story of a grand rebellion and more the story of one young man's growth as he continues to fulfill his destiny.",

There is no try.""","The summary line is one of my favorite movie quotes of all time because it embodies a philosophy and a discipline. Whenever I hear someone say 'I'll try', I already know it's a cop out with no intention of getting involved with the task in question. Had George Lucas 'tried' to make the movie, it would never have gotten done. I guess that's why Yoda is my favorite Star Wars character. Yeah OK, he's a puppet, but the character of Yoda is like the Spock of the SW universe, a stabilizing force (Force?) who helps Luke remain grounded and in control of his emotions.",
51,18 October 2017,gab-14712,10, My Favorite Star Wars Adventure!,"In 1977, a cultural revolution began with the little-known science-fiction film called Star Wars created by visionary director George Lucas. It ended up being the highest-grossing film of all-time and it still ranks very high in the midst of today's blockbusters. It was a very enjoyable movie and it created memorable characters that will live on for eternity. So of course we would get a sequel. In fact, Lucas created a whole world around his baby -an ambition that was not normal in 1980. With the sequel-The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas handed the directorial duties to his former college film professor Irvin Kershner because of his duties with his rising visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic, but of course he was very involved with this film. But enough of the background, let's talk about this film. This sequel is much darker in tone, more mysterious, and quite frankly the best film in the franchise. Our favorite characters like Luke and Leia Skywalker and Han Solo are back and we are introduced to more characters that are stored away in our hearts forever such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian. This is also the movie where we have the famous battle and reveal between Luke and Darth Vaderor shall I say between father and son, but more on that later.",
52,28 May 2022,ethanwissmann,10, Perfect Star Wars Film in an Imperfect Saga,"The Empire Strikes Back brings the viewer further into the galaxy of Star Wars. Following the events of Episode IV: A New Hope, this darker chapter brings newer characters and adventures to the table. We learn more about who we have already come to love in the previous installment and we are able to enjoy a much more well-rounded and fleshed out idea of what Lucas' galaxy far far away should look and feel like. Harrison Ford's portrayal of Han Solo steals the show alongside his companion Chewbacca, played by the late Peter Mayhew. Mark Hamill really ups his game with Luke, making him into a less adolescent and sheltered farm kid, he's learning more about his past and the life he never knew. Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa is the perfect mixture of sass and whit as she shows us that not all space royalty is uppity and useless. Billy Dee Williams knocks it out of the park with his performance as the suave and charismatic Lando Calrissian. With the success of A New Hope, this movie boasts and impressive budget increase. This is shown in the care and detail taken into consideration when seeing all of the creatures and vehicles shown throughout the film. Simply put, this movie CARES. The people involved put forth their best work to bring what the world needed in a constant rotation of mundane and bad sci-fi action flicks coming out around the same time. The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect Star Wars movie in an otherwise very flawed saga. I recommend it for anyone that wants to go on a wild and fun ride through the stars!",

Again as I said in my review for a New Hope, film criticism from me is practically irrelevant since I love the original 3 movies. The Empire Strikes Back is still one of the most shocking film experiences of my life, mainly in how it ended, in which the good guys lost, Darth Vader was Luke's father and it ended on such a somber note. It also led to extreme debate as to where they would go from here and many kids at the lunch table wondered how this twist came to be. I still stand by A New Hope being my personal favorite, but this is a better overall film, the snow walkers in particular are still breathtaking and Cloud City while not as spectacular in 1980, still holds up really well. At the time this was out of this world and I left the theater crushed at the film's finale, but eagerly anticipating Star Wars 3.",
54,13 June 2022,PCC0921,9," This film was released wide in the USA on June 20th, 1980","Before the release of Star Wars (1977], in the theaters, it still had to go through the same steps as any other movie. It too was considered a one shot deal, just like any other movie. It too, like every other film, had to pass the big test at the box office first, before anything else could happen. As everyone knows, this George Lucas directed film, was a huge box office smash, becoming the highest grossing movie of all time. It still held the record in 1980, thus giving the green-light for Lucas to develop a trilogy of films. What makes Empire Strikes Back (1980), so good, is the fact that, the film is one of those bridge-films. It bridges the gap from the first film to the third film. Some number two films in a trilogy, are susceptible to taxing pacing, caused by the need to be a set-up for the big finale in the third film. If done correctly, the film can be a successful bridge-film, while still completing its goal of being an exciting entry in the trilogy. This film accomplishes the goal of being an exciting adventure, full of maturing characters and it comes with a more darker side to it. It also successfully bridges the gap to the third film, Return of the Jedi (1983). It creates major implications for the main cast of characters. It is a cliff-hanger of a story.",

Yes, even better than the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. 'Lord of the Rings' is fine work but the characters aren't as well developed as in 'Star Wars' and they are too long. Also, each 'Star Wars' film stands out better than each 'Lord of the Rings' film. Three chapters in 'Lord of the Rings' is one big movie while 'Star Wars' is a space western, 'The Empire Strikes Back' is a dark, attractive and Gothic work of art and 'Return of the Jedi' is like a Disney film.

The Empire Strikes Back brings back the incredible original heroes, gives them even more depth and story and still finds time to bring in new timeless characters that become legends in their own right. Even with a new director at the helm, Irvin Kershner, the story and the world that made the first Star Wars so incredible is in tact and even better. The only problem really with the first Star Wars is it felt like only the beginning. Like there were layers of detail that we didn't get and The Empire Strikes Back burst into those layers and put us deep into the world and the story never to turn back. On top of that the film delivers the first and most infamous twist in film history...family connections so to speak. I won't give it away if you have existed under a rock for the last three decades.

68,5 December 2012,drqshadow-reviews,10," A Timeless Space Opera, The Perfect Sci-Fi Epic","Top of the line for a majority of Star Wars geeks, and for good reason. It's the ideal melting pot of George Lucas's vast, quirky imagination, his influences' knack for dark, large-scale epics, and his key contributors' determined efforts to retain a central humanism amidst all the creatures, effects and operatic indulgences. A wildly ambitious picture, it's genuinely amazing just how much territory is covered over the course of two hours. Lucas and company manage to leap from the Hoth battle to Yoda on Dagobah, the asteroid field to Lando and Cloud City, before finally climaxing with the classic Luke / Vader showdown and revelation. That's an awful lot of set pieces, not to mention some seriously powerful plot points, but smooth talking and a few outstanding performances keep the film from feeling over-stuffed or under-explored. The cast, too, grows on an individual basis almost universally, with Luke wrapping himself in the wisdom of the Jedi, Han and Leia developing genuine chemistry and Darth Vader, in a surprise twist that should never have been so effective, actually showing some signs of humanity. Although it can be hammy from time to time, those moments are balanced expertly by a wonderful series of mountains and valleys, to the point that they stop being seen as negatives and instead contribute to the picture's eccentricity. A legendary effort that's just as monumental, entrancing and electric thirty years later, it's damn near perfect.",

70,14 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,10, Stop me if you've heard this before--The best of the Star Wars movies,"Generally regarded as the best of the 5 Star Wars movies(so far, the sixth and final one comes out in May 2005), The Empire Strikes Back is everything Star Wars wasn't. Back in 1977, George Lucas brought us the first story from a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, Star Wars (Now known as ""A New Hope""), and it was a bright, cheerful Saturday afternoon serial with some great special effects. Three years later, George Lucas' story about Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo took a decidedly darker tone in The Empire Strikes Back. None of the good guys win in this second chapter of the 3 film saga that makes up the Original Star Wars Trilogy, the film acts as a dark bridge from the light, fun action of A New Hope to the concluding Return of the Jedi. Even the last scene of this film reeks of ""To Be Continued,"" without actually saying it. The rebel forces, after blowing up the Death Star, are forced to hide out on a the ice planet Hoth. Darth Vader tracks them down, and our heroes are forced to flee. Han and Leia go one way, Luke has to find the Jedi Master Yoda on his secluded swamp planet (voice of Frank Oz). Yoda may be the most lifelike character in ""Empire,"" and that's a pretty good compliment to a Muppet. We see Luke fail to master his Jedi powers, and we see him leave in haste to try to save Han and Leia who walk into a trap while visiting Han's old card playing friend, Lando Carisian (Billy Dee Williams). How Luke tries to save his friends is unimportant, as the single most shocking movie revelation comes during the final duel of the movie between Luke and Darth Vader. Unsuspecting movie goers have been blindsided by this scene for decades now. The tone, set by director Irvin Kershner, is darker and more serious, lends an adult feel to what is basically a kid's movie. The special effects are again top-notch, especially in the beautiful Cloud City and the fantastic looking asteroid field chase. Who knew in 1980 George Lucas had reached the pinnacle of his Star Wars franchise with a movie starring a green little troll voiced by the same guy who voices Miss Piggy?",
71,8 June 2005,arthurclay,10, The most highly anticipated sequel of all time,"And damn if it didn't deliver the goods and a helluvalot more. It is so dark in theme it almost enters horror flick territory and that is brilliance in and of itself to go from one extreme to the other so fluidly and poetically. It worked in a way that The Temple of Doom just didn't with moviegoers. I suppose that was due in part to the cool suspenseful plot developments, particularly Yoda, Han and Leia's budding romance, but largely due to the Earth-shattering ""the world is not flat it's round"" surprise ending. I would bet when George Lucas wrote that scene down on paper he must have been either laughing maniacally and saying ""Nobody could ever have seen that coming in two billion light years!"" or crying with joy all the while with the one idea that ""This will be so golden that it will be remembered til the end of time and even after that."" As Hamill said so eloquently, ""In the Empire Strikes Back, everyone has problems. Luke has problems, Leia has problems, they turned Han into a coffee table!"" I must also include Silent Bob's quote ""She says 'I love you.' and like a pimp he says 'I know'."" It was the equivalent of dropping burning napalm on the audience. They must have been more stunned than people leaving the theaters after seeing the Exorcist for the first time. It was pure 100% movie magic and worthy of the original in every aspect.",
72,21 February 2007,Marx_Bros_Fan86,10, Just as good as the first!,"Since its release The Empire Strikes Back has gained a lot of popularity, and it is now widely considered to be the best of the series. Initially many people were disappointed with its cliffhanger ending. I know I wouldn't want to wait three years for the answer to the ""big question"" that was surely on everyone's minds! Anyway, I think Empire has become widely respected for its maturity in comparison to the other Star Wars movies. It's much more dramatic than A New Hope, and it doesn't have the cutesy aspects of Return of the Jedi. Until Revenge of the Sith, Empire was the darkest Star Wars movie. Empire clearly beats it in the execution department though. All of the characters are put into the worst situations imaginable and have to fight their way out.",

Sympathy is induced when we see the back of Darth Vader's scarred and pasty head.

The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film. The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series.

It's weird to think that Yoda was only introduced here; he's been such a central character in the series that it's easy to forget that he didn't star in Episode 4! In some ways, watching ""TESB"", you get the feeling that the people behind the scenes realized how lucky the series was making them, and so they decided to go all out. And they do just that.

He is by far one of the best villains of all movie history, he is menacing, mysterious, then when he tells Luke, ""I am your father"", that completely changes how we first watched A New Hope. Effects are good for that time, also two others characters that I need to mention are Boba Fett and Lando Calrissian, these two characters really showed me that this is such a great movie franchise, Lando with huge charisma, and Boba being silent badass, so out of ten I would give this incredible movie a 10/10. Perfection.",

It combines an appreciably high level of character development with some genuinely exciting and riveting scenes, and introduced the well loved character of diminutive Jedi master Yoda into the formula. Villainous Darth Vader is brought to the forefront rather than being a lackey to somebody else. The relationship between cocky spaceship pilot Han Solo and serious minded rebel leader Princess Leia evolves to where romance can finally take place. And Luke Skywalker becomes more than just the naive and idealistic farm boy, letting his emotions get the better of him.",

What is going on inside that man.. ""A modern age Genius"". How does he come up with all that weird but super-cool stuff! And John Williams music..!!

107,1 February 2021,judemcrobbie,10," It's Star Wars, you know how good it is","The cultural and technological significance of The Empire Strikes Back speaks for itself. It revolutionised CGI and practical effects to a whole new level.
The characters are so good, no wonder why they're so iconic. Everything points to the director having an idea of the characters created: Yoda's monologue about the force is so beautiful, it embodies the love Yoda has for it. And Han Solo's ""I know"" is so to character, keeping that arrogant and boastful persona as he would.
The use of the force is the epitome of subtlety as it creates this beautiful living organism.
It's a cinematic masterpiece: where the CGI might not hold up today, the cinematography certainly does, clearly inspiring movies to come.
Obviously it's one of the greatest action movies, let alone movies in total.

125,24 January 2008,scott-sw,10, Probably better than Star Wars,"Call me blasphemous, but cinematically, The Empire Strikes back is far superior to the original Star Wars. We pick up shortly after the destruction of the Death Star. The Empire has dispatched probe droids to find the rebels. One probot finds a base on the remote world of Hoth. Frustrated, the rebels must bug out. Commander Luke Skywalker and his flight team make their stand against giant AT-AT Walkers and Imperial Snow Stormtroopers. Meanwhile, Leia cannot get to her transport, so Han Solo must get her out on the Millennium Falcon. Darth Vader is obsessed with finding Skywalker so he wants the Falcon. He will stop at nothing--even asteroids. Vader tracks them to Bespin where Han hopes an old friend, Lando can help out. However, Vader beat them there and force Lando to turn them over. Luke ventures to Dagobah to meet Yoda, the Jedi Master. There he undergoes training to be a Jedi. As he learns to focus the Force, he has a vision of Han and Leia suffering in a city in the clouds. He leaves training prematurely to face Vader. He is not ready. And he learns of Vader's secret. Star Wars was an introduction and The Empire Strikes Back goes deeper. At the outset, we learn more about the Force and how it can help. It was only vaguely touched on in the first one. We also learn more of Vader's sinister side. In the first one, his presence and appearance exuded evil. In this one, he demonstrates it through dispatching the Empire officers who fail him. We also get to see Leia and Han grow closer. Their love blossoms and grows. They had real chemistry. Finally, Luke really grows. He is the impatient, naive, and adventurous boy. He suffers for his decision. This forces him to mature. While some people found Chewabaca's incessant howling over the fate of Han Solo, I found it touching, giving the great side-kick alien depth and soul. The magic of Star Wars is unmeasurable. It was great swashbuckling fun with age old themes of good triumphing over evil. It allowed us to escape and be struck with wonder and awe. Empire, though, is thoughtful, deep, analytical, and fun. The audience will identify with Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie all the more because of their suffering. At this point, they were no longer larger than life, but human. I compare this to falling in love. With Star Wars, the infatuation and lust begins. With Empire, the love deepens and becomes solid. If it never happened, the love would not mature. This is Lucas truly at his best. I hope he recaptures this someday.",

132,25 November 2015,sharky_55,10, Much anger in him...like his father.,"Empire Strikes Back took everything that was revolutionary from Star Wars and improved it, and then some. It is deeper, more mature, and asks more questions of the world. R2D2 and Chewbacca, who became lovable fan favourites from the moment they hit the screen in 1977, did so without speaking a single word, but here they are much more than just accessories to the plot. In their grunts and roars and beeps, they now became beacons of loyalty for our group. The iconic opening crawl speaks of the events in between the two films - a time skip has occurred and the rebels are in hiding. The strengths of the characterisations show us exactly what has happened in these months unseen; Luke has become a respected fighter and commander, Han a captain, and his bickering and romantic tension with Leia only growing stronger (and which results in one of the most iconic confessions of love of all time). We see the bonds of friendship so much stronger in this sequel, and as Chewie attempts to repair CP3O and carries him around like a backpack, we recognise this is as an emotion of universality. No wonder Lucas used it again with Luke and Yoda. ",

From repeatedly re-watching it over the years, it's come to my attention that Empire is very different in comparison to the rest of the films. Sure it has its humor and all, but overall it's much more dramatic. My favorite films are those that depict the story before it has been shown, and the title alone, clearly foreshadows what's to expect in this film. It reveals a tragedy in which we see the first glimpse of victory for the Galactic Empire since the fall of the dreaded Death Star.",
166,30 August 2021,dormesher-21565,10, Episode 5,Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back. Another Masterpiece in the Star Wars Universe and this is definitely my favourite in the franchise and is definitely the best story they told.,

But that doesn't bring down the fact that it's one of the best sequels of all time and of my personal favorite star wars movies, everything that happens after this revolves around the twist in this movie, and then they made the prequels and revenge of the sith explains everything, I prefer the empire strikes back over revenge of the sith as a sequel, but as a movie, I prefer revenge of the sith, this movie also has a lot heart and stakes. So it's not perfect but it's still great.",

171,4 March 2005,jboothmillard,10, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,"One of the best film sequels ever made (along with The Godfather, Part II and Terminator 2), this is the second part to great original trilogy, and saga, from writer/creator George Lucas and director Irvin Kershner. ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" on the ice world of Hoth, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is investigating possible Empire activity, only to be attacked by a snow monster. He manages to escape with the help of the Force and his light sabre, but he is still stuck in the blizzard, and before going unconscious and being rescued by Han Solo (Harrison Ford), he sees a vision of Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness) telling him to go to the Degobah system and find Jedi master Yoda. So after a quick battle between the Rebels and the Empire, Luke, with R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) heads to this planet, and eventually he finds Yoda (a Muppet style creature voiced and performed by Muppet member Frank Oz, aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear), and they start training. Meanwhile, Han, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are in the Millennium Falcon, pursued by the Empire (because of a tracking device), and hide for a while in what they thought was the inside of a near meteor, but it was in fact the belly of a giant worm alien. When they do get out, they head for their destination to fix the ship, the planet Bespin, where they are greeted by Han's old shifty gambler friend (and original Millennium Falcon owner), Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). But what they didn't know is that Darth Vader (acted by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) and the stormtroopers arrived before them, and they are the bait of Vader's trap to get Luke, who he has become obsessed with finding. As a prize for finding them, Han Solo is frozen in carbonate and (when confirmed he is alive) is give to bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) to be delivered to crime lord Jabba the Hutt (who you saw in the first film). Eventually, Luke does land on the planet, and he and Darth have a long and exciting light sabre fight, while Leih's gang escape in the Millennium Falcon. The pinnacle twist and great quote of the film is, after cutting Luke's hand off, Darth Vader revealing the truth about his father's death, he says ""I am your father!"" After this he is eventually rescued, has his hand replaced, and Lando and Chewbacca fly away in the Millennium Falcon, a more more obvious 'to be continued' moment. Also starring Julian Glover as General Veers. It won the Oscar for Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music for John Williams and a Special Achievement Award (for visual effects), it won the BAFTA for Best Original Film Music for John Williams, and it was nominated for Best Production Design/Art Direction and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 67 on The Ultimate Film, and along with the Episode IV: A New Hope, both were number 1 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!",

The special effects are as good if not better than the first film and the characters are much better than in the first.  Though George Lucas didn't direct this enstallment, I think that's good because it gives the chance for Irvin Kershner a chance to see what he can put on the screen for us to watch.  And it is actually quite good.  With a terrific soundtrack by John Williams, the character Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz who is my favorite puppetter ever beside Jim Henson) and a startling revelation (this is the film where we find out Darth Vader's secret), this film is a dark, enchanting and great movie experience.",

The settings for the entire movie are outstanding from Hoth to Cloud City. As always the score from John Williams was on point more so than ever in my opinion. The movie is set between episodes 4 and 6 doing a perfect job of not only carrying through the success of the first movie and surpassing it in my opinion but also does an amazing job of setting up episode 6 to conclude the trilogy without leaving an annoying cliffhanger at the last minute. The characters really establish themselves with more famous moments such as Han Solo's ""I know"" line towards the end of the movie and we get to see Luke's agony as he hangs from cloud city.",

But it did deliver! This movie went to even darker places this time around, and the characters are left at the lowest point by the end of the film. Great action sequences, great acting and above all the biggest twist of all time! ",
177,10 June 2005,cookiesap,10, Probably one of the most influential movies on my life,"ESB is one of the best science fiction movies of all time. In most circles, there tend to be a division between 'regular' movies and science fiction ones, but the Empire Strikes Back not only wrote the importance of the previously establish Star Wars saga into history, but borough the Joneses and Kims and N'Danou's and Guptas and everyone else from all over the world a re-lived curiosity about a genre that often is exclusively reserved to geeks, gamers, and goblins. The first star wars movie was a feat in special effects and something quite new. The Empire Strikes back, however, drew us into a new world with an amazing conviction. We were all so very much standing next to Luke and Han, so that they have almost helped share their world with us, but also influence popular culture today in a somewhat surrealistic concept, where the actors/actresses step out of the TV/silver screen and dictate the 'real' world, using their 'fantasy' world to justify for their candor - in an almost 'emperor's new clothes' fashion. Only the greatest movies have the ability to enmesh reality and the fiction on the screen. Lord of the Rings did it, Hitchcock did it, and Lucas did it! Lucas made us believe in a world far away, long long time ago, which any other creator would have made seem like another Star Trek or Stargate episode (like the prequels).",

180,17 October 2005,JamesHitchcock,7," Entertaining Adventure, Not to Be Taken Too Seriously","""The Empire Strikes Back"" clearly has the feel of the middle episode of a trilogy. The beginning carries on from the original ""Star Wars"" film; although the Death Star has been destroyed, the Empire remains strong and the evil Darth Vader continues to hunt down the rebels on their base on the icy planet of Hoth. There is no really definite ending; the film might just as well have ended with the words, familiar from old Saturday morning serials, ""To Be Continued""- which of course it was in ""Return of the Jedi"". In between, the mix is much the same as it was in the first ""Star Wars""- a science-fiction adventure incorporating elements of other film genres, notably the war film but also the western, the oriental martial arts film, sword-and-sorcery type fantasy and the Robin Hood type of mediaeval adventure, all topped off with a helping of mystical religion.",

This film wins this monicker because - unlike most sequels that try to repeat the original & fail - Empire, as most Star Wars fans affectionately call it, delves deeper into the character's psychology & the film introduces new, cool characters such Yoda, Boba Fett, & Lando Calrissian that spark our interest!! The film takes us in different directions & to different planets & one of the things - in an odd way that is satisfying to the audience - is that on the surface the evil Empire WINS in the end making this one of the few American movies to my knowledge where this happens!! Extremely well directed by Star Wars creator George Lucas' late mentor the late Irvin Kershner, Empire has outstanding performances by all its actors with classic lines that still permeate American culture today!! Excellent special effects, a soundtrack that is second-to-none by legend John Williams and a set up for a very satisfying sequel film make The Empire Strikes Back the strongest film of the franchise!!

190,18 June 1999,GuyCC,10, This film goes well beyond sci-fi. A true cinematic masterpiece.,"The Empire Strikes Back represents everything that I've come to expect from a film: Brave heroes, menacing villains, a well-written story, fantastic action scenes, a strong supporting cast, drama, romance, surprises, and a beautiful musical score. ""Empire"" focuses heavily on developing the characters from the first film, rounding out their personalities, and introduces several great new characters (Yoda, Lando Calrissian, Boba Fett). The special effects still hold up well to today's standards, the dialogue is witty and intelligent, and the character dynamic allows the actors to play well off of each other. It's a very different kind of film in that the ""good guys always win"" theory is proved wrong, and Darth Vader's surprise revelation at the end of the movie is still one of the best movie moments ever, which was shocking for its time.

As for the 2004 DVD version, it still has the original flavor of the theatrical cut, the touches are few, and still has most shots from the original version. Also, may I add that all of the characters are perfectly developed and lovable, villain or hero. Han Solo is a great character in this, all because of his charming and awesome performance by Harrison Ford. My favorite character from Star Wars is Chewbacca, and there is no exception here. The stop motion animation done with the AT-ATs and the Taun-Tauns still are amazing today, and the wonders of the ship battles are just as beautiful. Overall, Empire is my favorite Star Wars, and one of my favorite movies. It has everything- heart, humor, action, drama, suspense.

The effects 45 years later are still pretty amazing with amazing sets and puppetry work by Frank Oz, an amazing opening scene with tons of action and an ending that ends bitter sweet yet somber.

She is also so much different from New Hope. When New hope was a happy and bright movie, Empire strikes back was dark and not afraid to do something new and dark. Also this is the first movie that Yoda is in. Special affect in this film is amazing during the 1980s, everything that happens in space is amazing and the practical affect in this film is gg.

While the original film has grown somewhat dated in appearance, and Return of the Jedi feels a bit silly now, Empire has maintained remarkable staying power. The effects in the film feel as fresh now as they did in 1980, and as importantly the story and tone of the film still hold an ominous feel and lend the series the grandeur that made it so lasting. Without Empire, Star Wars would have been remembered but not nearly in the same way. Everything that was begun in Star Wars was expanded and improved upon here, right down to the score Remember, this was the movie that introduced the now-famous and ridiculously overplayed Imperial March composed by John Williams. And virtually every scene is now iconic--the Imperial Walkers in the snow, Luke's training in the swamp, the asteroid field chase of the Millennium Falcon, the Cloud City, Luke's lightsaber battle with Vader. When I think of ""Star Wars"", most of the images that come to mind first are from Empire. The colors and textures of the film are so sharp and rich.",

Luke Skywalker is instructed to seek Jedi training from Yoda. An attack by Imperial forces leaves the Rebel base in ruins but Han Solo, Princess Leia and company narrowly escape in the Millennium Falcon. They venture to Cloud City where Lando Calrissian betrays them thus setting a trap for Skywalker. Cliffhanger ending hinders it in standing on its own but director Irwin Kershner explores darker aspects. Mark Hamill returns as Luke who learns endurance, concentration, priorities, friendship, and very hard truths that leave him literally dangling for survival. Harrison Ford as Han learns to put the needs of others ahead of his own particularly when sacrifices arise. Carrie Fisher return as Leia who strengthens her leadership. Billy Dee Williams as Lando realizes his mistakes and hopes correction is possible. David Prowse dons the suit and presents the intimidating presence of Darth Vader who presents those ever famous hard hitting words to Luke. Special effects are just as electrifying with the appearance of Yoda among other creatures and landscapes. The film serves as a follow up to Star Wars with intriguing suspense and imagination.

220,23 June 2020,alene-56179,10," ""No, I am your father""","The Empire Strikes Back expands upon the established world of Star Wars without forgetting what made the first movie so amazing. The effects are just as enthralling as they were in Star Wars (if not more so), as shown in the amazing new worlds that Empire introduces (Hoth, Cloud City, Dagobah), and John Williams once again blows us away with a score that is on par with his work in the previous movie.
The story takes us in a different direction than Star Wars, giving the audience a greater insight into the workings of the Empire and Darth Vader's character. Vader's arc culminates in his iconic confrontation with Luke Skywalker at Cloud City, which ends with possibly the greatest twist in movie history.
Empire's story is more mature than its predecessor, and leading actors have matured and greatly improved as well (props to Mark Hamill, who did about half of his scenes with a puppet and still made them believable). The dialogue is sharp, the camera work is clean, and new iconic characters get to shine in this movie. I especially loved when Yoda gave his explanation of what the force is, increasing the audience's understanding without removing any its mysticism.
Overall, this movie expertly balances pretty much every aspect it should. The acting, the visual set pieces, the sound design, the score, and the story all shine, combining to create a masterpiece of a movie.",

'The Empire Strikes Back' manages to do so by being less of a sequel than it is a new film on its own. The story begun in 'Star Wars' is advanced, the characters & their relationships with one another are deepened and the film itself abandons much of the easy spirit of the first film in favour of a darker and more uncertain tone. If the first film was largely about heroism, the second is largely concerned with struggle. The main characters are soundly tested in this film and for the most part, they come up short.",
223,5 August 2007,KlinePatsy,10, The dark heart of Star Wars,"Star wars is a Saturday morning breakfast serial, with the upbeat 'let's have an Olympic medal ceremony' ending...Empire discards the fluffiness and moves away from its simplistic predecessor's obvious appeal to the child fanbase, without scaring everybody away in the process. The 2nd Star Wars film takes the original cast and subjects them to 2 hours of major discomfort...A forbidding icy planet replete with nasty creatures. There are ugly bounty hunters, monsters hiding out in the depths of asteroid fields, and Luke's foray into the black swamp of the Degobah system. It's a more taut, curiously downbeat film that slows almost to a halt in places, as Luke meets the Jedi Master who will teach him the ways of the force. The set pieces more than make up for the lack of pace...The opening battle on the Ice planet is a visually effective affair, and the stormtroopers have never looked as cool when they don their winter outfits. The asteroid chase and cloud city sequence are visual treats, that take you into the mysterious heart of the Star Wars Universe. The character development glues everything together. Luke's maturing process in the darkness of Degobah..Han and Leia's romantic chemistry, the droids comic relief and interplay with Chewbacca solidifies the group together and establishes a team spirit that was coming together at the end of Episode IV. The centrepiece of the film is the epic showdown between Luke and Vader,with that massive revelation, which inevitably ranks as one of Cinema's all time memorable moments. And it's a great sequence, from Vader's sobering welcome 'The force is with you young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet' to the almost surreal climax. The forces of darkness loom large at every turn of the film...you get the feeling that the rebels are just slightly out of their depth. There is an underlying menace at work that heightens the dramatic tension..Vader is never as beautifully evil as he is in Empire. We finally see just why he is (Emperor aside) the top dog in the galaxy, as he lays waste to his own generals in ruthless fashion. We get some great new characters...Han's old buddy Lando Calrissien (sp?) is the slimy administrator of cloud city, who finds himself in a no-win situation, and there's the legendary Boba Fett..bounty hunter with balls of steel, and an outfit so cool it instantly establishes him as a Star Wars icon. And of course, the emperor rears his ugly head, and we get a taster of his malevolance. Any faults? It's hard to find much complaint. Some of the dialogue strays into cheeseland, the pace is interrupted with the curious but necessary Degobah scenes, but all in all, the sum of the parts adds up to a supremely effective, tightly woven sci-fi drama, the most deliciously dark of all Star Wars movies, and the most mature. Classic entertainment, stuck in a time capsule of its own, with enough memorable moments to ensure its place in the higher echelons of cinema history.",

225,3 February 2016,Horst_In_Translation,6," Okay movie, but not an epic","""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is the second film from the ""Star Wars"" franchise and the fifth in terms of chronology of the contents depicted in there. It was directed by Irvin Kershner over 35 years ago and had some success with the Academy Awards, even if not nearly as much as the first film. And I myself must say that I found it not better than the first (even if the IMDb rating says so), but also not much worse. Once again, it delivers especially on the visual side in terms of sets, cinematography and special effects while coming a bit short in terms of the story. The characters are all fairly memorable though, the humans and the others. There are many many characters that appeared in the first film already, for example Obi Wan Kenobi is even back for one scene, but there are also some interesting new additions, most of all the uber-famous Yoda. And Darth Vader is the main villain in here while being just one of several villains in the first film. A great light saber sequence is included here too.",

I remember going to see this when this was released theatrically as a little kid with my grandma. Empire is one of the rare cases where the sequel blows away the original. Creator George Lucas got some very good help in making this with writer Lawrence Kasdan and hiring a director that actually knows what he was doing, Irvin Kershner. With outsourcing some good help, this collaboration turned out to being a winning team to bring (and improve upon) George Lucas's vision. The film looks incredible to this day and the groundbreaking special effects from the 1st film are improved upon and look better here. The story in this installment is darker(and better suited to my tastes), but is also stronger and better as a whole. The characters are better fleshed out then the original film, the chemistry between the actors and performance are also much better. Not only is Empire Strikes Back the best in the series, but I also would argue that it's the foundation on which the franchise continued to explode and why it holds up today.",

In The Empire Strikes Back, George Lucas allows his story outline to be scripted and directed by other hands (Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan on the screenplay, Irvin Kershner on directorial duties). It is a triumphant science fiction epic, a film of great invention and excitement, with remarkable set pieces and tremendous special effects. The film has a darker quality than its predecessor which lends a more complex and mature feel to the proceedings. It also manages the near-impossible job of being a thoroughly satisfying ""transitory"" movie  you have to remember that this movie doesn't have a start in the normal sense of the word since it continues a story already begun in an earlier film, nor does it have an end as such because much of the plot is left unresolved in preparation for the next movie.",
230,12 January 2003,jennifer_litchfield,4, Star rating: 2 out of 5,"Star Wars - Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, rather suffers from 'middle child' syndrome.  Being the second of the original trilogy it has neither the fresh appeal of originality that marked its predecessor, nor is it required to reach any conclusions.  The result is a film with decidedly minimalist plot development.  The Empire is still hunting down the Rebel Alliance, Luke Skywalker is still training to be a Jedi knight, and. . . . .. . . . . well, that's pretty much it.  Instead of a solid storyline, the viewer is treated to 122 minutes of cobbled-together battle sequences (although watch for the impressive Imperial walker troop carriers, which resemble out-sized armoured elephants).

It's much more enjoyable and interesting when you know what everyone's talking about! This being the second of the ""original"" films, coming after the mega-success of the first movie, there was obviously more money spent on the sequel and it shows.

The rest compared to that scene is pretty good, including Yoda's first appearance, Cloud City, and of course, ""I am your father."" It's interesting that this Irvin Kershner replaces George Lucas for the directing (I almost assumed Lucas directed all six films).

That honor goes to STAR WARS:EPISODE V,THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (ESB)(1980). ESB is that rare sequel that manages to top it's predecessor. Make no mistake, though, ANH is still as magical, pure, and fun a flick as it was in 1977 when I first saw it as a kid! But ESB ups the ante and succeeds in it's own depiction of the Star Wars universe. In reality, ESB is in basic tone the antithesis of ANH, which is a big reason why I think that BOTH films stand the test of time! If your in the mood for a fast-paced, imaginative adrenaline-rush of pure action-adventure, then pop in ANH! But if you want imagination combined with character depth and detail, mystery, mood, and atmosphere, then ESB is more your cup of tea! ",
236,5 July 2008,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, The best of all six,"Where the first was an introduction to this vast universe, this is a further adventure in it, and an expansion of it. New worlds, creatures and technologies. Like its predecessor, this has something for everyone, and this is a stronger film... perhaps the most so, of the entire series. Kershner is undoubtedly at least part of the reason... he worked to make the characters realistic and credible beyond what they were, and it pays off. The various relationships are more believable than in the others, and the developments are very natural. This offers an emotional connection to the material, for the viewer, in addition to all the entertaining aspects. The plot remains interesting throughout and it never stands still. The pacing is spot-on, there isn't a boring moment in the two hour running time. The effects are impeccable, and Lucas had the crew push themselves to the limit, and it shows... big time. The score is yet again fantastic, Williams adds to what he created for IV. The acting is good, and seldom poor. The tone gets darker, setting up a sequel. The episode before this was a solid story even if it would be the only in the franchise, and this is a perfect middle part. This has by far the greatest light-saber action in the Original Trilogy. This is exciting and masterful with dialog and tension of high quality. The DVD features a commentary track well worth a listen, with several speakers, including Irvin. I recommend this to fans of Star Wars(regardless of what exactly you take that to mean), science fiction and movies. 10/10",

Now I have sat down to watch back-to-back both the theatrical and updated versions of the second movie, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and my verdict is still unanimous on that one as well: this is one of the best science-fiction movies ever made and it still baffles me how critic John Simon could comprehend of saying that a movie this bold and imaginative and daring and thrilling is junk and is dehumanizing to the younger generation. It certainly isn't to me. And the reason why I primarily admire ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is not the fact that its special effects are first-class or that they are used with imagination, but that its dominated by a superb science-fiction story, memorable characters, smart dialogue, and a true foreboding and mysterious atmosphere totally alien to the cheerful opera-like personality of the first movie.",

And let's just say that I hadn't seen it in years just before I voted. And a 10 sounded so, well, unreal, especially when you should actually presume that it's the original Star Wars which deserves a 10. If one of the movies should have one. But it was this one I found right. I still do. I am sure that this is the absolutely greatest adventure movie of all time. Of all Star Wars movies. Of the Indiana Jones movies. And of the Lord Of The Rings movies. Of every adventure movie I have seen, this one is the very best. Why, you will probably ask. Most people I know either prefer Star Wars IV or VI to this one. But I think they forget to take acquintance to the amazing chemistry there is between all the cast in this movie. And the classic scenes, there are many more than in the other movies. Luke meeting Yoda, and Yoda's amazing wisdom for such a small, little green alien. Vader confronts Luke. The truth revealed. Han and Leia's first kiss, and C-3POs interference. The introduction of Lando. Boba Fett. Admiral Piett's absurd rise to great Imperial stature. The battle of Hoth. Han frozen into carbonite. Just about everything of the dialogue, acting, everything of it is so classic, so climatic, so absolutely real. The Empire Strikes Back is the absolutely finest film in the entire Star Wars series.

As a brief summary, The Empire Strikes Back is a classic example of a movie that the critics of the time got very wrong. Initially receiving mixed reviews and being slammed by some is nowadays considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time and the best Star Wars film overall...and its not hard to see why! The Empire Strikes Back continues on from the events of Star Wars revisiting the characters of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo. The Empire Strikes Back is known to be the much darker sequel, with much more character depth, vulnerability and emotion. Lucas continues to develop his beloved characters in all the right ways with the Han-Leia relationship, the more powerful feeling of friendship and of course the biggest, most shocking twist in cinematic history with Vader and Luke in the final act of the film. The Empire Strikes Back also continues to evolve the world introducing us to new places, new characters such as the legendary Jedi master, Yoda, improving the special effects and an even more beautiful soundtrack, provided by John Williams. The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect example of a sequel done right, equal and at times even better than the original. Epic battles, intense space chases, powerful emotional character development, shocking twists, thought-provoking ideas, themes and messages and finally groundbreaking sequences and special effects. In terms of flaws The Empire Strikes Back virtually has none whatsoever, other than an unfortunate twist which has had a negative response later on in the franchise, a few unnecessarily long scenes of Luke's training, and in my opinion a slightly weaker general plot than the original story.

Not only did this sequel have a tougher job to live to its original counterpart (a box office phenomenon that would forever change marketing, merchandising, and film-making for generations to come), but this sequel quite frankly did the unthinkable by changing the tone, raising the stakes, and not promising a happy-go-lucky ending that usually associates with sequels. Empire Strikes Back is yet another Star Wars movie that broke the rules of how to make a film and also ushered a new style and technique of film-making.",

The exotic names and grotesque creatures become hard to digest after a while. Lightsaber duels afford opportunities to doze. I saw this movie because I saw the one before it.

Hoth was great but did not see why we had to spend first ten mins watching Luke get captured by the yeti type monster. The chase in the asteroid field was all a bit yawn.

In this chapter, the empire is closing in on the rebels and Luke must go learn from a mysterious Jedi named Yoda, while Han Solo and the rest of the rebels must dodge Darth Vader. The beauty of the first Star Wars is all here, the elements of destiny and fate, the terrifying scenes of Darth Vader, the powerful visuals, and the well-timed comic relief.

If you haven't, I would definitely suggest looking up some of these documentaries in order to see what the project was actually like when it was first made.

Once the picture premiered, it didn't seem to matter to the faithful that it was missing the frisky spirit of ""Star Wars"", as well as a solid finish. Mark Hamill returns as Luke Skywalker, being educated by mystical Yoda and facing off against Darth Vader, who reveals an unanticipated secret. Irvin Kershner's direction is thoughtful--he brings to the action sequences a deep undercurrent of purpose--but he's also mechanical, perhaps spending too much time with Luke (who, due to a car accident suffered in real-life by Hamill, has a perplexed, dour appearance). Harrison Ford provides lots of old-fashioned charm, the special effects and music are wonderful, but the cliffhanger finale wasn't really fair (at the time, it felt like a slap in the face).

But how did they know they'd fight against walking moto-quadrupeds? Well, they didn't. It dawned on me that that was nothing more than lazy storytelling.

309,7 April 2020,deloudelouvain,7, Better than the first one.,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, and A New Hope it's now time for The Empire Strikes Back. I thought A New Hope was the weakest one, okay it's the oldest one and so the special effects are not of the same level as more recent ones but the truth is that the later ones are just of better quality in every domain. the Empire Strikes Back was already a bit better but still not of the same quality as the others. I probably watched it as a kid and gave up after that as it's just not that good. I don't know why this one gets such a high rating, it's definitely not better than any of the previous titles mentioned. I agree that the used special effects at that time might have looked good for 1980 but still it doesn't make it better. For that the story and the acting were just not of the same quality. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing.The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the seventh movie of eleven in barely 72 hours for me, next one today will be Return of the Jedi in the hope the quality still continues to improve, looking forward to it.",

Luke Skywalker is getting Jedi training by Yoda (his first appearance in the series). We see a determined Skywalker trying to master the technique of being a Jedi, and attempt to rescue his friends. What results is another film full with imagination, character development, action and suspense. One of the best heroic scenes, I think, in the movie is when Skywalker tries to master the technique of moving and lifting objects using the Force. The element of friendship and love continue in this film, as we see a growing teamwork bond between C-3PO and Chewbacca, and a love interest between Princecss Leia and Han Solo; all the human drama blends in well with the sci-fi action.

334,7 June 2023,CinemaSerf,9, The Empire Strikes Back,"I have reviewed this film before but I thought that it deserved an extra special mention. Yesterday, this was the first film I saw in a cinema since we were all confined to barracks - and boy what a cracker. Where to start with the superlatives? It's fantastic - right from the opening bars of John Williams' score; on through the three mini-adventures rolled into one, we are treated to a marvellous feast of well-written, snappily directed, entertaining action packed adventure. Picking up from the first film, our rebels are holed up on a frozen planet being relentlessly pursued by Darth Vader. When one of his probes discovers their icebound base, they've got to get the hell out of there. Now sure, the CGI suffers a bit after 40 years; and can someone please tell me what the point of these lumbering Imperial Walkers is? They are like metal polar bears that constantly trip over their own shoelaces, but aside from those most minor of criticisms we have a great story; characters that we care about (personally, I'm an huge Vader fan) and who develop plausible, credible personalities; the detailed animations of ""Yoda"" are superb to see again on the big screen and it builds excellently to a sword fight the like of which has not been seen since ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938). It is, I think, better then the first film and for my money is the best sci-fi film ever made. Made for the big screen - and brilliantly made at that!",

336,19 July 2013,lesleyharris30,10, Sci-Fi at its Very Finest,"Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's an impressive sequel that manages to surpass the expectations of its predecessor, this is the standards that every film maker should aim towards when considering a sequel, the first one is fun and introduces the characters in a light hearted manner, but this one further develops them and their universe in a much darker tone. It's definitely the bleakest film in the series, showing the main characters succeed the least, and even the ending isn't particularly joyous, let's just say the title suits the overall tone of the movie perfectly. The cast are still in great form here, in fact several of them have improved between the three year gap of the first movie, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher have certainly improved as actors and, overall, they seem much more comfortable in their roles. We are also introduced to some great new characters in this film, such as Lando and Boba Fett, but the one who stands out the most for me is Yoda, one of my favourite characters of the franchise, Frank Oz perfectly portrays the wise and woeful personality of this master Jedi. There are so many noteworthy moments here, whether it be the wise words from Yoda, the battle between Vader and Luke or Han's farewell to Leia, every scene makes me smile, it's a piece of film history that will be remembered for years to come. Terrific performances, a thrilling storyline and special effects that still hold up today, fans of Star Wars and sci-fi in general will not be disappointed by Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back, I would recommend it to all moviegoers.

I've seen many sequels over the years, Terminator 2, Aliens, RoboCop2, Shrek 2, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings (bare with me on those two since I know they're book series), etc. and yet none of them seem to hit the beats of the development of the characters and plot alongside the action so perfectly balanced. I don't know, my review may seem a little ramble like but it's just one of my all time favorite movies and I'm kind of at a loss of words for how to talk about it professionally.",
339,4 April 2014,ironhorse_iv,9, The sequel that strikes back and was pretty good.,"Directed by Irvin Kershner, The Empire Strikes Back, like the original movie came out with mixed reviews with a difficult production, it's since then became considered one of the greatest film ever made. The film is set three years after the events of Star Wars IV: A New Hope where Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has studying the Force under exile Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). Mid while, Darth Vader (voice by James Earl Jones), is in pursuit of him and the rest of the Rebel Alliance. When his friends are capture, Luke Skywalker must confront the man that kill his mentor, and save his comrades. This gritty movie was once criticize for its darker tone, and cliffhanger ending, but I love it, it really put all the characters to their limits both physically and emotionally, dealing with deceptive allies and make you want to watch the next movie. That's great filmmaking. Like its predecessor, The Empire Strikes Back draw from mythologist Joseph Campbell's book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, directly in it's tales that is taken right off from several mythological like Arthurian, classical Greco-Roman and others. There are similar motifs taken from other films and television shows like 1936's Flash Gordon, 1975's Dersu Uzala, and others worth noticing in the film. The movie even took influence from historic events like Nazism, the Wild West, and Samurai culture. It even dig into world religions. Some people might seeing the teaching of Yoda as boring scenes, but I love them. The movie really makes good on explaining more about what the Force is. The Force remind me of a new age amalgam of various eastern religious and western philosophical sources. A sense of Manichaeism, mixed with elements of Ralph Waldo Emerson's Romantic nature worship, Pantheism and Western-influenced Buddhism. Luke is not as annoying as the previous movie, as the film is mostly about his growth to maturation and self-discovery, but he does have some awful whining in this movie that makes you want to slap his face. Yoda in this movie works with the puppetry. The way Frank Oz performed and voiced him, made this character stand out. Not once, did I think it was a puppet. I would say, this was way better than the CGI Yoda or the puppet from Episode 1, big time! Industrial Light and Magic really pull it off, the action scenes in this film. This movie really make the Hoth Battle look real and intense. Another big prop to them is how great, Cloud City looks. As the technology has improved, Lucas has continued to tinker with the films, adding more creatures and more detail to the backgrounds and even reshooting certain scenes to get them closer to his ideal vision. In my opinion, this is one of the film that didn't get ruin by the 1997's Special Edition with pointless added scenes or badly done 1990's CGI. Glad, they didn't add the bad delete Wampa scenes. The Special Edition in my opinion, honestly, made it better. A good example of this is Cloud City. You really see more of the city than the original. It's beautiful. The 2004 version hurt the film a bit, changing Boba Fett's voice, but at less they add the real Emperor. The music by John Williams is great. I love the Imperial march introduced in The Empire Strikes Back as the theme music for Vader's pursuit of Han and Leia. The march's rhythm is driving and relentless, capturing Vader's own relentless progress through the story. For action, it's not as epic as 1977's Star Wars, but the story is way better than that movie. The love story in this film seem more realistic than the fairy tale love affair in Episode 2. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fischer) are just amazing in their roles, and give the movie, it's really needed humor. You know that they kinda dislike each other, but slowly they found caring for each other. That's realistic. The love affair had a shade of grey to it. One memorable exchange of dialogue was partially ad-libbed in which the character professed their love with Han Solo given a badass reply. That was amazing! Without spoiling it, the whole cliffhanger about Han Solo was at least in part due to the fact that they were not sure that Harrison Ford would return for a third film. I glad he did. Another thing, good about the writing is that there isn't a lot of dumb things that question logic in this film, like the other films. I did find a few. I don't like the whole Leia kissing Luke thing. It makes no sense even if Episode VI wasn't made at the time. It's still gross. Another one is how Ben Obi Won Kenobi (Alec Guinness) hide the truth from Luke, throughout the film for no good reason. Why!? You would have thought that information would help Luke deeply before heading to Cloud City! It doesn't make any sense. Once again, without spoiling it. During production, there was great secrecy surrounded the truth about Darth Vader & Luke Skywalker's relationship, to the point that most of the crew didn't know about it. I like how George Lucas fought for this movie. To preserve the dramatic opening sequences of his films, Lucas put the screen credits in the end. Even though this is more common now, this was a highly unusual choice at the time as the Writers and Directors Guilds felt that the credits should be shown first. They fined him and attempted to pull the movie out of theaters. Due to the controversy, he left the Guilds, and the Motion Picture Association. He also left 20th Century Fox over controversy when the President Alan Ladd Jr. got fired for helping fund the sequel, which cause Fox to lose Raiders of the Lost Ark's film rights. Overall: George Lucas change movie history with this film and the world is better because of it.",

Episode IV's introduction to George Lucas' world of aliens, droids and intergalactic war struck a chord with audiences back in 1977, and continues to do so today. It is a fun good vs. evil story that only touches upon the spiritual elements of the 'Force' that we now know so well, and on the vastness of the universe it is set within. Personally, I have to agree with Dante's argument that Empire offers a darker and richer experience, which not only develops the series' mythology even further, but paints its characters with far more layers than seen before.",

Mature and thoughtful in a way the first film never was (though still chock full of the kinds of critters and fx that most fans of the original took to), this first sequel remains the best (by far) to date. For once in this series, the viewer feels s/he's in the hands of a genuine STORYTELLER. While Lucas himself may have written the script, it's Kershner who gives EMPIRE life, whose taut direction lifts what might've been just another also-ran sequel to a much higher plane than the original ever attained. (For every step forward, there is a step backward: the next film in the series would turn out to be the worst of the lot.)",

It is usually common for a follow-up to an original to be a let-down, but THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is not one such example. Directed by Irvin Kirschner, this new chapter in the saga doesn't just live up to its predecessor, it surpasses it--and then some. The storyline takes a darker, more heavy-handed spin as Luke, Han, Leia, and the Rebel Forces find themselves under assault from Darth Vader and the Imperial troops. As the movie progresses, we root for our heroes to prevail--only to find ourselves downcast when we come to the somewhat sad (yet hopeful) conclusion. Yet the movie is all the more magnificent for it.",

You can definitely see that they hadn't planned for this film in advance because there's a lot of new stuff.

Actually he's knocked unconscious and taken captive by a horrifying Yeti-like predator to be savagely devoured. Immediately, the tone is set in stark opposition to the movie's predecessor. We're on Hoth, a planet blanketed entirely by snow and ice, routinely pummeled by countless meteorites from a neighboring asteroid belt, but the craters are fleeting as the planet is in a perpetual snow drift. The only native creatures to our knowledge are the tauntaun, camel-like creatures, and the Yeti-like ones. The latter eat the former.

When Luke Skywalker is on Planet Hoth, it would quite resemble Antartica in a way. The Tauntauns are the fine animals that would endure the harsh cold there. And the Wampas are so fierce they would catch any victim off guard. Luke Jedi instincts paid off against the Wampa. I liked th part where Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew) snickers at Han Solo(Harrison Ford) where Princess Leia Organa(Carrie Fisher) tells him off. There were a lot more characters in the movie, too long to list, but I know that in the swamp scene, where Yoda teaches Luke more about the Force. And getting that X-wing fighter jet out of the swamp needed more work. Then there's the battle between Vader and Skywalker. That fight scene would take the storyline further and further to the truth of Anakin Skywalker; Luke's father! This movie has a lot to show, and it's just as fun as the fourth one. Which I thought was the first. Still, I enjoyed this all the way through. 5 Stars!",

365,28 May 2006,dee.reid,10, I know it's a little late but...,"...What can I say? I wasn't even alive when ""The Empire Strikes Back"" came out in 1980; I wouldn't be around for another five years after its release and even then, I still couldn't comment on it like this until I had learned to read and write. But it's 26 years later and we can't change what has already happened. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is considered the best (if not the best) movie sequel of all time and here's why: it just can't be topped; it's that good, it's that awesome. Bigger and bleaker than its 1977 George Lucas-directed predecessor, ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" this time directed by Irvin Kershner, is an example of a movie sequel done right. It's completely different from the original and does not try to repeat formulas or details or ideas from the predecessor and most importantly, it's just too damned good and much better than ""Star Wars."" Some time after ""Star Wars,"" the Rebel Alliance has retreated to the ice planet Hoth while the Galactic Empire has sent imperial probe droids all over the galaxy and luck out when one reports back data from Hoth. The Empire, now under the command of Darth Vader (played by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), sends effects wizard Phil Tippett's AT-AT walkers to the planet to lay siege to the Rebel base. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) must journey (with unwilling robot ally R2-D2 accompanying him) to the swamp planet Dagobah to begin his training with venerable Jedi master Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz). In the meantime, swashbuckling pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is on the verge of leaving the Rebel Alliance behind in favor of repaying his debts to intergalactic gangster Jabba the Hutt but his growing affections for Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) keep him, his ship the Millennium Falcon, and Wookie co-pilot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) around and in service. After the Rebel base evacuation, Solo, Leia, Chewbacca, and droid C-3PO journey to Bespin's Cloud City to reunite with Han's old buddy Lando Calrissian (trilogy newcomer Billy Dee Williams). ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the definition of a fantastic movie sequel. As stated, it's bigger and full of more surprises than the first entry. With more shootouts reminiscent of our favorite westerns, fearsome bounty hunters (including Boba Fett), more Force philosophy and a climatic lightsaber battle (that reveals a secret so big it deserves its own movie), it's everything a proper ""Star Wars"" picture should be.

Introduced are many well-done stop motion animation sequences and Yoda created by the Jim Henson people and the voice being his counterpart, Frank Oz. What this movie does(which was originally the 2nd star wars film) is takes the good formula of the space cowboys epic and gets you to care about the people involved. A nice little love triangle is hinted at between Leia, Han and Luke and the bantering between the stars seems more natural than in the 1st movie. We are also setup for the next entry with a rather hokey ending but nevertheless the movie, for the most part, is fun like the original with slightly different settings, and the same battle between the good side of the force(the rebels) and the dark side(the empire) with Darth Vader taking over greater control and becoming more obsessed with his personal issues(mainly the turning of Luke to the dark side).

Amplifying all we had shown earlier and presenting new facts of great importance for the entire series of films in cinema, The Empire Strikes Back, even without a beginning and an end, is regarded by most fans as the best of all movies.",
375,19 April 2005,MinorityReporter,9, Much better than the original,The second instalment of the original trilogy is in my opinion far better than the original film. The original film introduced something brand new to the movie scene back in the 70's but aside from being an instant classic and being very original it had some problems. The characters were very badly drawn up making them nothing more than card board cutt-outs and in the end that felt very unfulfilled. This problem is rectified in Empire Strikes Back. Its very obvious that George Lucas has had more fun writing the characters in the second movie. He begins to give them edge and more depth. The story in the second film is also far more fulfilling than that in the original and the twitch at the end is still one of the most interesting and well-thought-out twitches in movie history.,

377,19 October 2020,rtrnt,9," Best Star Wars sequel, doesn't quite exceed the original","I could watch this many times and re-evaluate Luke Skywalker and Han Solo's character development. But I still think the original is probably the best. It's a debate that anyone who has seen all the Star Wars films could have any time. Even so, I thought this was a mesmerizing that held my attention from start to finish. It's also a great film about building up courage and fortitude for a challenge that lies ahead, specifically Skywalker's storyline in this film. Give me Darth Vader's best scenes in this film, give my Han Solo's best lines and Skywalker's training with Yoda and I'll tell you about a film for the ages. The Empire does strike back. And what a strike it is! Highly recommended",
378,30 April 2002,Agent10,10, The best movie of the series......until further notice,"Until Episode II comes out, this will rank as the best in the series. Not only are we introduced to Yoda, we're introduced to a darker side of the series, a film that doesn't feel like it is a part of the group collective. I think this is why so many fans regard this as the better film. This movie also gave us one of the best sword fights in the history of cinema, culminating in a climax that seemed improbable at first, but quickly made a lot of sense. This was easily Lucas' most witty edition to the series, and it tends to stand up better than most would think.",
379,6 June 2008,gcd70,7, Best of three?,"Episode V in the ""Star Wars"" trilogy will always be remembered as the film that introduced a serious plot line to proceedings. After the rebels' success in Episode IV, the Empire chased them throughout the galaxy, finally confronting them on the ice world of Hoth. The group escapes and Luke goes to train as a Jedi under Yoda. Lando Calrissian betrays them to Lord Vader, and the evil master of the dark side has a startling revelation for Luke. Captain Solo is sold to Boba Fett who takes him to Jabba the Hutt. All of this leaves us hanging for Episode VI. Though thick on storyline, and revered by critics, it was probably the least entertaining for the kiddies with its meandering middle and sparse action. The AT-AT Imperial Walkers and the Millennium Falcon's flight through the asteroid field are the definite highlights.",

Larger than life battles such as the Hoth invasion and the final lightsaber duel between father and son strike this film home and being bigger and better than the original, with a darker and more brooding villainous plot that leads into the third chapter of the saga, it keeps viewers entertained and captivated. The story beats aren't forced and each character is given time to become fully realized, even side characters like the bounty hunter Boba Fett, who doesn't need a lot of dialogue for us to know his intentions. ""A New Hope"" is us being introduced to the force, while Empire Strikes Back sees us believing in the power of the force, through characters like Yoda and Ben Kenobi, and the all too real Luke who struggles with the belief, we are transported to this galaxy and I definitely don't want to leave any time soon.",

When I was a teenager, i was gratefully exposed to possibly the finest special effects (for it's time) in cinema history. The advantage of sequels is that all the characters have been previously introduced and so you are straight into the action, on a thrill ride (to outta space and beyond). The musical score was brilliant and most effective, when coupled with an already iconic baddie 'Darth Vader'. The general feeling from the 'Star Wars' faithful, is 'Episode V' is the very best and I totally agree.

Most people who saw Star Wars A New Hope thought that Darth Vader was Luke's foe, but when Empire came out, near the very end of the film, Darth Vader revealed his true identity to Luke by saying these immortal words...""I Am Your Father."" To add insult to injury, Luke's right hand gets cut off by his dad's light-saber and Han Solo gets carbonated!!! Once Jedi opened 3 years later, everything was solved and they lived happily ever after. The End. Out of all the Star Wars movies that have came out, this one is the best.",

You could take a pre-existing story, expand upon it greatly and STILL make it a well-rounded and debatably self-contained movie. Empire reprises the stars of the original Star Wars movie and makes them all shine; Mark Hamill is great as a self-doubting yet well-meaning hero, Harrison Ford again gives a great take on cinema's most loveable scoundrel Han Solo, and the late Carrie Fisher gives Princess Leia a post-Alien sci-fi feminist makeover in that she's no longer anyone's damsel, but her own strong-hearted woman.",

I already pointed out that I won't be seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi in a theater because Star Wars: The Force Awakens really disappointed me. The Force Awakens is perhaps the most shallow, uninspired piece of filmmaking that I've ever seen in my life. Actually, recently, I got a lot of enjoyment out of reading user reviews of The Force Awakens on IMDb. Almost all the popular reviews on IMDb gave this film a rating of one out of a possible ten stars. On the other hand, almost all paid film critics praised The Force Awakens when it was released. As some people pointed out, this shows that film critics working for popular newspapers and websites can't be trusted. They praised The Force Awakens because they were paid by Walt Disney Studios or because they were pressured. There is a word in the English language that describes this situation. It's corruption. What's interesting is that Disney has been pressuring movie theaters into showing The Last Jedi in all the largest auditoriums when the film will be released. In other words, it seems that Disney wants to make as much money as possible in as little time as possible with the release of The Last Jedi. Make of this what you will. Possibly, The Last Jedi is a disappointing film, just like The Force Awakens. Therefore, Disney wants to make as much money as possible before negative reviews by honest film critics begin appearing on the internet. I'm sure that The Last Jedi will be showered with overwhelming praise by paid film critics upon release, just like the awful The Force Awakens was. I'm not saying that The Last Jedi will be just as bad as The Force Awakens. Rian Johnson probably managed to make a better film than The Force Awakens. But it's possible, maybe probable, that The Last Jedi will also turn out to be a disappointment and a cash grab.",

416,25 December 2000,stamper,9, The Saga continues...,"with this masterpiece of the Star Wars saga, which in my opinion is the best part of the whole series. I always thought that way and I guess that will never change. Of course I got some criticism, but it is basically the same I have for Episode IV and that would be that the special effects seem not as good as they once did, which is basically due to the enormous change and improvement on the special effects department. Besides that though I do not have any criticism on this film. As with the other Episode I also am talking about the Special Edition here and I must say that Lucas has done some good improvement with this Episode as well. There were a bunch of altered or added effects, like explosions and a few scenes in the city in the clouds, but the part that was altered best, I think, was the one in the beginning involving the creature in the snow. There were really some good scenes integrated here, which all looked very real. Maybe besides the fact that there was just a little blood when Luke gave the creature that stroke with the saber. That might be another criticism of this film. I mean there is quite a bit of lightsaber action in which someone is hit (three scenes) and it just appears that there is almost no blood lost. This might be regarded as a bit unreal by some people, but I was satisfied with that, for I am used of it since I was just a little kid and I think it was much better than the stuff that happened for instance in Indiana Jones (which I saw when I was about 11 or so) . For those scenes at the end of the first Indiana Jones really gave me the creeps when I watched that film for the first time and I had quite a couple of nightmares afterward.

418,29 April 2006,tom-darwin,10, The Most Spectacular Outer Space Fantasy Ever Made,"Although ""Star Wars"" set a new, spectacularly high standard for movie effects & action, it was also a remake that featured a cast of unknowns & semi-retired character actors. Even with a big budget and built-in audience, it would have been easy to make a second-rate follow-up or even a dud bad enough to kill the franchise. Leigh Brackett's clever script, Irvin Kerschner's directorial craft, George Lucas's unprecedented production values & the energy & intensity of the cast allowed ""The Empire Strikes Back"" to set a standard for outer-space adventure that has never been equaled. Lucas's first original ""Star Wars"" story emphasizes the series's two great strengths: fantastic action & the wily, wicked Galactic Empire. After their hidden base is found & destroyed, the Rebel Alliance flees in disarray, with Solo (Ford), Princess Leia (Fisher), Chewbacca & the droids hotly pursued in the damaged Millennium Falcon by an Imperial fleet. Luke (Hamill) vanishes into a jungle planet to find Jedi mentor Yoda & complete his training. Story flaws, including the fact that Luke's training takes place in the same amount of time as the Millennium Falcon's pursuit & the introduction of important characters near the end of the film, are unnoticeable unless you're looking for them. The action starts early & never lets up, with the battle of the ice planet alone more than enough for any action film. But there's plenty more where that came from, with the amazing flight through the asteroid field & the lightsaber duel in the cloud city standing out. Ford makes the most of his opportunity of developing Solo as a charming ""scoundrel,"" with Fisher game as his reluctant love interest. Hamill, who isn't really leading-man material, is sufficiently believable as the peasant hero growing into an elite warrior. The New Age, Oriental ""Force"" (rarely called a ""religion"") gets more prominence in ""Empire"" but never bogs down into hokiness or boredom. All these elements combine to give the film a never-failing theme of harried heroes hounded by an evil force that is so vast, powerful & diabolically clever that the viewer is moved almost, but not quite, to despair--exactly where Kerschner wants us. This is outer-space fantasy, not science fiction, so don't look for any science. And despite ""The Force"" as a plot device, there's no point in looking too deeply for Heavy Themes or Subtle Meanings. In fact, subtlety of any kind was pretty much killed off by this and other Lucas & Spielberg films. All you get with ""Empire"" is a couple of hours of straightforward, nonstop, matchless thrills without condescension or manipulation that you can enjoy again & again without ever getting tired of it.",

430,7 August 2017,dexmajor,8, Best film!,"The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action. It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development. The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film. The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series. This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional. This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish.",

432,3 April 2005,DarthVoorhees,10, Sequels this good don't come often...,"The original Star Wars was a spectacular movie.When you watch it,you are hooked from beginning to end.Star Wars didn't drag.It is an amazing film to look at too,the aliens,droids,and the fantastic planets.Doing a sequel would not be an easy task.Watching Empire Strikes Back you get the same experience while watching Star Wars,maybe even more so.All though Star Wars is a without a doubt a great film,it had some flaws,mainly in the character development/dialogue areas.Empire Strikes Back soars in these areas.You didn't really know much about Darth Vader in the original Star Wars,except he was a former Jedi who became a Sith lord,and helped start the Galatic Empire.Empire Strikes Back gives him an all new edge,he is eviler,angrier,and obsessed with finding Luke Skywalker.Luke earlier in the film has a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi,his slain Jedi Master from the original Star Wars,telling him to seek out Yoda on the Dagobah system to complete his Jedi training.Luke does so after Imperial forces drive out the Rebels from their base on the Hoth system.Han Solo has grown more from Star Wars as well.He isn't the tough guy he used to be.He is softer and is falling madly in love with Princess Leia.The character of Han is given much more character development,he is maturing from the Smuggler he once was.He is afraid of being chased around the galaxy by the Empire,and Jabba the Hutt's bounty hunters but he knows he must do what is right.Han,Leia,C-3PO,and Chewie are being chased by The Empire most of the film.Vader knows Luke loves his friends,and that they are his weakness,if he finds them,and tortures them Luke will do his bidding.Luke learns The Force from Yoda on the swamp planet of Dagobah.Yoda is an interesting character.We all know he is a rubber puppet but for most of the time is very life like and you forget about it,because the character works so well.Another benefit of the Yoda character is that we learn much more about the concept of The Force from him,the concept hasn't really been fully explained but you get the basic idea.Luke is getting pesky he wants to become a Jedi and grows tired of Yoda's methods of training.Yoda explains that a Jedi doesn't want excitement,and that they must be patient.He also tells Luke that the Jedi aren't Warriors.Through a vision of the Future,Luke senses what could happen to his friends by Vader's hand.He rushes to save them abandoning his Jedi training.Han meets with Lando Calarissan,an old friend of his,on Bespin for a place to hide.The Empire is there waiting for Han,they turn him over to the Bounty Hunter,Boba Fett.Han is put into Carbon Freeze.Just when you think anything couldn't possibly be worse,Luke arrives to save his friends,falling directly into Vader's trap.Luke arms himself with his lightsaber and challenges Vader to a duel.The Duel in the original was badly done,partially because of Alec Guiness' age at the time.The duel between Vader and Luke is so much better because it is darker and thrilling.The battle lasts very long but eventually Luke is defeated after Vader chops off his fighting hand.And this is when possibly one of the most memorable lines in film history is said.Vader asks Luke if Obi-Wan ever told him what happened to his father,Luke replies in a rageful voice,he told me you killed him,Vader replies No Luke I am your Father.I would have loved to been alive in 1980 to see Empire Strikes Back,and the reaction to that line.",

436,16 September 2021,connormurf,10, One of the most breathtaking and exciting films of all time,"Straight up, this movie is just so enjoyable to watch. I couldn't tell you the amount of quotable moments or movie influence this film has had at the time of its release. The characters, as if they weren't good enough already, are thrown into completely different scenarios to what they were presented with in 'A New Hope', and it's because of that, we as the audience only grow to love them more. Han Solo's character in this film has changed significantly from the last film, and we are now presented with this half rebel, half scoundrel character that is trying to become a better person and leave his life of smuggling behind, only for him to be chased by the galactic empire across the galaxy alongside Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO. Luke skywalker begins training to become a Jedi, but still has this reckless trait about him that ultimately leads to his defeat in an impulsive and deadly duel against Darth Vader, who reveals to Luke in one of the most memorable parts of the movie that he is Luke's father. Combined with breathtaking special effects and immersive storytelling, this film has risen to become one of the most influential films of all time, inspiring captivating and exciting storytelling and giving birth to the modern cliffhanger ending that many blockbuster films utilise to this very day. It is without any doubt, that Star Wars episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, is an iconic piece of cinema that continues to be treasured and adored by many, and a film many would agree to be one of the greatest of all time.",

442,21 May 2006,Bogmeister,8, Zooming Through Those Asteroid Belts,"Episode 5, or the middle one of the first (now second?) trilogy of the Star Wars saga, has a great rep these days. It wasn't met with the same delight when it first came out in 1980 and I still don't believe it's quite as good as the original Star Wars (or episode 4-A New Hope). Somehow, despite a much larger budget, the epic scope and fabulous feel of a new universe (a new galaxy far away) is not quite there with this entry. Maybe you can accomplish such a feeling only once. The rebels and heroes flit from the icy world of Hoth through an asteroid belt and end up in the cloud city of Bespin, but it strikes me as a very small, enclosed universe here. I also noted some overacting on the part of the main characters during the first sequence on Hoth, especially from Ford and Fisher - or maybe their lines were just poorly written. The easygoing charm of the first film was gone; yes, this episode was meant to be darker, more somber by comparison. But that doesn't mean the characters need to be awkward, rough shadows of their previous incarnations.",

This might be the best of the 80's, well maybe tied with Scarface or well maybe even tied with Return of the Jedi. The action was actually very cool and impressive too and Han Solo again is hilarious with his pal Chewbacca. Carrie Fisher was pretty hott in that one dress.

Darth Vader is as memorable as ever, including that dramatic jaw dropping moment when he tells Luke he is his father, leading it to be one of cinema's most memorable moments and probably my favorite movie moment! The movie opens up with the planet Hoth and an assault on the rebels, marking yet another marvel of cinema.

453,8 June 2019,andrewroy-04316,8," Much like its predecessor, Episode V is epic and excellent technically, with more clear character and plot arcs","The Empire Strikes Back has the same grand feel of A New Hope, but brings a bit more consistency in the arc of the story. While A New Hope was exceptional for its world building and ambition in throwing us into this fascinating world. The Empire Strikes Back is more measured and has a clear primary focus on Luke's growth vs. Vader's determination to capture him, with Han and Leia's rebellion goals and relationship as secondary pieces. The plot felt a bit jumbled in A New Hope, particularly due to the abrupt shift in focus from rescuing Leia to destroying the Death Star, which was a sloppy transition. Here, we have a much more consistent plot culminating in a climax that is fitting and is likely the biggest moment of the series. I would dispute the notion that it's an all-time great twist - while it's absolutely surprising and impactful, the greatest twists add deeper layers and comprehension to prior events. We didn't know Vader well enough for the reveal to really click anything into place or imply anything deeper about either of them, aside from explaining how Luke is strong with the force. There's some minor silliness as always (really? they just made him a new hand?) but I think the plot is effective and exciting.",

Admittedly, I'm kind of slanted towards this one, since this is one of my early childhood moviegoing memories, since my mom took my brothers and I to a really big theater in New Jersey to see it.  This film explores the central characters deeper without sacrificing thrills and excitement, and while it's a more obvious set-up for the next movie than the first one was, it's still got a good climax scene that allows you to take away something good.  Ford and Fisher are able to create something together too, and Mark Hamill comes off better than in either the first or third ones.  In the book I read on the STAR WARS movies, it said Lucas liked this least of all, but I think he's wrong.",

There is no try.""","With the stage set in A New Hope, and with a cast of fresh likable characters in a vast galaxy, The Empire Strikes Back provides a follow-up that many consider to be the best Star Wars film in the franchise. The film definitely pumps up the stakes as the Rebels are driven away in a massive battle, before the characters become hunted, and ultimately entangled in a web of treachery. This film will probably always be memorable for its big reveal towards the end though; an epic twist of fate that undoubtedly surprised everybody back in 1981. Overall, this film is darker than its predecessor, much more serious than any of the other films, and has a certain theatrical flair that could supersede every other film in the series.",

But it has amplified everything that the first movie did to 11. Better effects, better costumes, better pacing, some interesting air battles, the addition of the legendary Yoda and the iconic revelation about Darth Vader and Luke.

A simple story and impressive special effects for its time seems to have had an amazing impact in its day (which is long before mine) but should in hindsight be seen in a new light. It is no coincidence that the new Star Wars films receive such low marks (even though much of the acting and special effects are better) because they can't live up to those old childhood memories. Lucas wasn't even that original, given that Star Trek (and many other science fiction films) came before this. The Star Wars films pass for their special effects and level of entertainment but are clearly over-hyped and definitely overrated..",
466,18 September 2020,xiaoli7377,10, The Greatest Fantasy of All Time,"Note: this review is based on the 2019 version of the film available on Disney+. There have been many different versions of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" released through the decades, and the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy is infamous in the fact that the original theatrical versions of the films are not widely available to the public. With this in mind, I believe that denoting which version of the film that I am watching to write this review should be taken into account. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the least altered of the original movies, with only a few very minor shots, special effects, and continuity changes made to the movie. It is commonly believed that this is because George Lucas had the least amount of involvement in the production of this one. I honestly don't mind any of the changes made to the second film at all: the continuity changes help bring the movie in line with other films in the franchise, and the updated special effects at Cloud City are nowhere near as jarring and annoying as the changes to Mos Eisley in the first movie, or Jabba's Palace in ""Return of the Jedi."" That all being said, I would still prefer the option from Disney to watch whichever version of the movies that I want to watch.

Perhaps this can also be attributed to the fact that even before watching this film, I already know about the spoilers given that I'm watching this so many years after the very famous plot twist occurred.

481,5 March 2018,buckikris,10," The Adventure Continues, In The Empire Strikes Back","Several years after the Battle of Yavin, Luke ( Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and Leia ( Carrie Fisher) are back. Their friendship has grown stronger for one another; especially Leia and Han's. The Rebellion have found and formed a rebel base on the ice planet of Hoth. It seems to be going well, until an Imperial Probe Droid is dispatched out to the planet. It locates the rebel base, sends the report to Vader( James Earl Jones). Once the findings are complete the droid automatically self-destructs. The Battle of Hoth begins, with the successful flight of the first transport off of Hoth. Leia is reluctant to leave until Han says she has to go, he successfully gets her aboard the Falcon just in time. The fighting continues, but eventually dwindles down. The rebels tell Luke they will see him eventually at the rendezvous.
Luke has other plans he and R2( Kenny Davis) set a new course for the Degobah System. Once there Luke will track down Yoda( Frank Oz ) to begin his Jedi Training. Meanwhile, Han, Leia, Chewbacca( Peter Mayhew ), and C-3PO( Anthony Daniels )are having trouble trying to escape the Imperials. The Star Destroyer Avenger is right on their tail, along with a ton of TIE fighters right into an asteroid field. Han is slick he fly's through the field like a pro. He realizes he must find one that he can land on for awhile. As soon as he can, he moves close to this huge asteroid. It seems like they have found a safe place to lie low. The Millennium Falcon has taken a lot of hits and is in need of repairs soon. Han and Leia at times seem to be at each others throats, but deep down they strongly have feelings for one another.
On the Star Destroyer Avenger, The Emperor Palpatine( Ian McDiarmid), makes contact with Vader. He warns him of their new enemy, Luke Skywalker. Vader believes if he could be turned to the dark side he would be a powerful ally, a great asset. Luke's training on Dagobah is tough and sometimes turbulent. Yoda gives him advice, but Luke sometimes fails to listen. This is particularly noticeable when his X-Wing sinks deeper into the swamp and his failure through the cave. He is angry, feels hopeless, until Yoda talks to him more about the Force. Yoda proves his might by helping get Luke's X-Wing free, using his Jedi skills.
Han and Leia still stuck on the Asteroid, discover a terrifying fact. They are not on the asteroid, but inside a worm creature that dwells in the rock. They are able to get back on board and fly out just in time. As soon as they are free, they are met with enemy fire from TIE fighters and The Star Destroyer Avenger. Han turns the Falcon around, makes a bluff and proceeds into attack mode. Captain Needa( Michael Culver) on board the Avenger is shocked. The Falcon is there one second then gone. Upon seeing this , he realizes he has make a fatal error; and must report to Vader. The Falcon has docked aboard The Avenger until they can fly away undetected to a safe place. Han tells Leia the way they will escape is when the Avenger dumps it's trash, then we will float away undetected along with the rest of the trash. In the meantime they must search for a safe port to land, in The Onenid system. They find Bespin, which is home to Cloud City. Han is familiar with it's administrator, Lando Calrissian ( Billy Dee Williams). Inside The Avenger, Darth Vader employs a few bounty hunters to find the Falcon. A substantial reward await the one who finds it. Among them is Boba Fett ( Jeremy Bulloch). He is the Mandorolian, who vows to make good on Vader's promise. When the trash is released, The Falcon detaches; and heads for Cloud City, not realizing Boba Fett is behind them, in Slave 1.
Luke's is now training successfully, but it is suddenly interrupted when he sees visions of the future. He tells Yoda he must go and save them, but Yoda demands he must stay and complete his training. Luke promises he will return, and fly's off.
Once The Falcon arrives in Bespin Air space, the four are met with numerous Cloud City pod cars. They are authorizing them for a landing permit which they don't have. It gets a little uneasy, but finally they get permission to land. They are instructed to land on Platform A, I believe. Once they get out of the Falcon there is no one there to greet them-strange. This makes Leia very uneasy, and Han gets upset with her. A few minutes pass, finally Lando along with his trusted aide Lobot( Jack Hollis ) arrive. At first, it looks like it could be an angry reunion, but Lando welcomes them, especially Leia. While in Cloud City Han and Lando catch up on old times, Han tells Lando the Falcon needs repairs. Leia senses something is wrong especially when 3PO goes missing. When Han and Leia are alone waiting for Lando, she tells Han something just isn't right. When Chewy comes in he is carring C-3PO, he's been blown into parts. Leia hopes Chewy can fix him fast.
Lando comes in notices the droid and says something, but he wanted Han and Leia to join him in a refreshment first. Once they arrive to dine, the door opens up. There is Vader, Fett, and stromtroopers and they surround them. Lando said he had no choice but to turn them in, Lando was offered a deal to fix his own problems.",

He's ruthless, insightful, powerful, ambitious, and devious. Most importantly, we find out why he is so evil--he wants to take over the galaxy!  His ambitions are no different than the rebel's, except he wants to be emperor.  He doesn't care about Han, Laeia, Chewbacca, or the rebels--they are just pawns in his ambitious game to depose the emperor.  Of course in episode VI, we find out where his true sympathies lie.",
483,17 October 2010,s_daad,1, Grossly overrated,"This film is bad in the sense that it is hardly a film at all. It has no structure, no dialogue, no screenplay, a threadbare story, but one that is not told because of non-existent direction, etc. It continues where the original left off, and just notches off plot elements one by one without any urge to tell a story, or develop characters, relationships, etc. The makers probably conceived this as a filler between numbers one and three and didn't bother with it. Of course, that's all right. I don't have any problem with that. But what really does disturb me is the high praise meted out to this ""film"" from almost every quarter – from viewers and critics alike. On this board it's being rated as the 17th best movie of all time. I've consulted quite a few film guides, and they all tag maximum, or near maximum, stars to this film. Even more bizarrely, they consider it to be the best of the series, and in my mind it's clearly the worst. What is going on? Of course, it's not difficult to see why this film is idolized. The first film was both good and a milestone. Not great, but it was the perfect statement for an age. It was a fairy tale that was confused as science fiction. The ""Force"" embodied morality, even religion, for the space age. It is set in the distant past and therefore pertains to origins rather than where technology is going. Spaceships and laser guns are just the backdrop, and have nothing to do with the story or the subject matter. When this film appeared in the middle of the crisis-ridden seventies, it really must have been a beacon of ""new hope"". And to put the ground-breaking special effects into its proper context, they symbolized optimism. There is no doubt that the effects served the story well, but they served even better the mood of the age. And with all this going, Star Wars rightly became a tremendous hit, and the focus of fanatic devotion. It was to be expected that any sequel would have been gobbled up by the fan base, as long as it didn't spoil the original. Empire doesn't spoil the original. It not only continues the war between good and evil, it does so with more spectacle, more aplomb, more special effects.",

Being the second film in the old trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back works in a much darker way then the original Star Wars. The film starts out with our heroes on Hoth, an icy planet, while the empire chases after the Rebels. After an awesome land battle and a rebel defeat, Luke flees to seek help from a Jedi Master and Han and Leia are chased by Darth Vader in an asteroid field.",
485,8 September 2004,InpraiseofFolly,3, Overrated,"I decided to watch this trilogy with a completely open mind to see what the fuss was all about. I was rather embarrassed by the fact that I had never seen any of these movies which were heralded as great cinematic classics. Instead of the masterpiece I was promised however , I was left with a great mediocrity. The characters were barely 2 dimensional , the plot was riddled with holes and horribly rushed and the dialogue was cheesy . Episode V was perhaps the least painful to watch but still isn't close to being good. I don't know if it's a case of a movie aging very badly but I can't for the life of me understand the allure of it. To each their own , I guess.",

I praise this film as having the best soundtrack and the best battle sequences. Plus we get some new faces in new and exotic locations. And that revelation (you'll see what I mean). From what I heard, this was the least successful film of the saga but it's still good as the secondary film. And that lightsaber duel between the main hero and the main villain. I recommend watching A New Hope first just to see how everything starts, then watching this. I should warn you, it gets a little dark, but it's nothing too scary.",
487,22 April 2007,RiffRaffMcKinley,10," Dark, gritty, and depressing-- and it couldn't be much better","We do not need to mention Luke's bout of horrific acting in the Cloud City lightsaber battle. Somewhere, it has been dealt with accordingly. The fact of the matter is, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is even better than its predecessor-- and by a country mile. Instead of wasting time with pointless exposition (title crawl excepted, of course), the film starts right in with two of the main stories-- Vader's pursuit of Luke and the Rebel forces going on the run after an astoundingly impressive battle scene between heavily armored walkers and the hopelessly out-gunned Alliance. Luke learns the way of the Jedi from Yoda, a wise, green, raspy alien who looks like the child of Kermit and Miss Piggy (which makes sense, considering Miss Piggy was also voiced by Frank Oz).",
488,12 February 2012,nickmesafilms,10, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) - I Am Your Father!,"The fifth (or second) installment of the highly successful ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" really took me along for the ride. Set three years after the original, the Galactic Empire, in the clutches of Darth Vader, are still in pursuit of tracking down Luke Skywalker and his small band of friends, including Han Solo and Princess Leia. When Luke tries to learn the Force from Jedi Master Yoda, and his friends are captured by Vader, he must decide whether to complete his training to become a Jedi master, or confront Vader to save his friends. Wow, what a movie. As a big fan of the original, I'm an even bigger fan of ""Empire Strikes Back"". This movie blew me away with everything new. The characters are still memorable, the visual effects are still awesome, the environment is breathtaking, the story just got better, and the character of Yoda was just plain awesome. But my favorite part in the whole movie was the final confrontation between Luke and Vader, and the climatic ending, that's better to be left unspoiled, is one of the greatest endings ever seen in a movie. Also, this movie was actually very dark, due to containing some graphic moments of blood, killings, and even torture. I was just thinking the same exact thing: ""awesome""! I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish, and I was blown away by how better the series gets. This is the most darkest, thrilling, and jaw-dropping movie of the whole series so far. Again, this is so far, my favorite Star Wars movie in the series. ""The Empire Strikes Back"", in my review, ""an entertaining spectacle, truly an excellent masterpiece"".",
489,3 May 2016,tankace,10," One of the best movies ,period!","Empire Strikes Back is no doubt one of the best movies in history. Just everything in here was better of the previous installment.

If I could give it 11 /10 ,I would but ,that it might created problem in the IMDb system ,so 10/ 10 is good enough. It is said that like the New Hope, the production of the Empire had a ton of issues, for example Carry Fisher was high on cocaine during all of the shootings of the movie and the majority of the crew was not in more clear state of mind ,if you know what I mean. Fortunately the Force was strong and the movie was excellent, which by itself that fact considering the production problems is a miracle. I love this flick and as a very picky person ( not in food anyway) I want the best possible and here I got it, I highly recommended it for watching immediately. May the Force be with you!",

491,24 August 2022,Drawmort,7," The film's reputation is clearly justified, although it's not a masterpiece either",In this Episode V the prologue has much more logic. It's a good context for the beginning of the film and not an omission of a sequence that cannot be allowed.,
492,4 December 2001,ecatalan98,10, I Agree with you all: Empire RULES!!!,"Having read most of the comments herein, I must agree that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the best movie from the original Trilogy. The acting, effects, story and most noticeably, the music, surpass far and away the original (and that is saying a lot!!!). Though it's obvious ""Empire"" would not be the classic it is were not for the first STAR WARS, it still manages to stand high on its own. As a music lover, I must say the the original ""Empire"" Soundtrack has to be John Willimas BEST musical score EVER. The ominous ""Imperial March"" (also known as Darth Vader's theme) was SO strong, that its motif has appeared in ALL subsequent films, including ""The Phantom Menace"". Same goes for the love theme of Han and Leia, Yoda's theme, and the list goes on. On the acting side, Harrison Ford's acting on this one was his most mature performance out of all STAR WARS movies. His performance on ""Return of the Jedi"" looked watered down compared to this one. Same goes for Carrie Fisher's performance. In ""Return"" she looks tamed and subdued, a far cry from the bossy, devil-may-care attitude of the first one and ""Empire"". And Mark Hammil's acting on this one was his most solid and convincing. It's weird that ""Empire"" worked so well, since most of director Irving Keshner's movies are always a bit contrived. He also did ""Robocop 2"", but that was a mess (thanx in part to the plotless script and last minute re-writes). ""Empire"" is a movie that I saw when I was 12 years old, and to this date, it still amazes me. Let's hope that George Lucas comes to his senses and do the new trilogy justice with the upcoming ""Episode II"".",

496,31 July 2002,Dockelektro,10," The definition of the word ""unmissable""","This movie is probably the reason why so many people devoted their lives to worshiping the saga George Lucas had started three years earlier. Here the adventure continues, but with a twist - after having the basic characters thrown in the first one, here we get a souping-up, and everything and every one is multiplied by 100. The result is the best movie in the Star Wars saga. Here we have some rawness typical of A New Hope, and we still don't have the excesses of Return of the Jedi. The result is a brutally touching movie, where its characters are the main theme and not the battles or the special effects. Magnificent work by everyone involved, the movie is a triumph, and one of the best movies ever. John Williams also suceeds to beat his own work, and present us with a richly crafted score.",

498,27 October 2015,troyputland,10, Better than the first?,"The Empire Strikes Back does not suffer from 'middle film syndrome'. It greatly enhances the Star Wars universe. Luke Skywalker's (Hamill) adventures take us to the ice planet Hoth, where the Rebels are hiding from the Imperials. They're eventually rooted out by Darth Vader and his army. Luke, Leia (Fisher) and Han (Ford) and the droids make their escape, the former heading to Dagobah for Jedi training, whilst the others seek help from an old friend. TESB is full of blistering action; the battle of Hoth, with the AT-AT walkers and Luke's first Jedi experiences making the back of the neck tingle. A now heightened romance between Han and Leia plays out to stunning effect. New characters are introduced, but only a few so that Empire never detracts from the main trio. Then there's the twist. If you don't know about it then you should, otherwise start watching Star Wars now. There's no need to be a fan of science fiction, just excellent entertainment.",

Who are we to question any aspect of the definitive masterpiece of all of human existence? Every technology breakthrough-from fire or the wheel, all the way to the computer or the internet-is merely a means to this end. If there were an asteroid aimed at annihilating all of human history, and we could only save one cultural artifact, it had dang well better be this movie. It represents the high point of human achievement. It is so mind bogglingly good that George Lucas should probably be etched in stone as his own version of Mt. Rushmore.

Looking at the Star Wars 'franchise' (hate that word) as it stands now, this is the film that made the life and longevity of the thing possible. Empire is truly the best of the Star Wars films and a strong contender for best sequel ever made. It's a film about relationships and growing and learning who you are. It's about finding your place in the world/galaxy and understanding how your impulses,as strong as they are sometimes, are not always the path to progression and betterment. I understand Empires power now, it's a film that teaches if you let it. Its also an amazing spectacle of the imagination that furthers something that was already brilliant and groundbreaking.

520,25 January 2021,Jackblyth8,9, Film Poetry,"When George Lucas was asked which was the worst Star Wars film, he responded with 'The Empire Strikes Back', one of the only original films from the saga that he did not direct. Episode 5 was proven to not be the worst episode and instead, was rather flattered by the critics, gaining 94% on Rotten Tomatoes and 8.7/10 on IMDb. The ensemble cast is carried over from The first film released 3 years before Episode 5, 'A New Hope' and produces a thrilling encounter of the Rebellion' resurrection. It is evident that the titles are almost back and forth for the Rebellion's sake, whenever a title is in their favour, the next Episode pushes them back. It has been 3 years since the destruction of the Death Star and the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia, has set up a new base on the ice planet Hoth, a desolate, low-temperature, snow-blizzard land. The Imperial fleet, led by merciless Darth Vader, hunts for the new Rebel base by dispatching probe droids across the Galaxy. Luke Skywalker, struggling to control himself in the cold, is captured by a wampa while investigating one such probe. He finds himself tied up, hanging from above in a dark cage, the newly named Jedi is able to escape by using the Force and his lightsaber. Before Luke succumbs to hypothermia, the Force spirit of his deceased mentor, Obi Wan Kenobi, instructs him to go to the swamp planet Dagobah to train under Jedi Master Yoda. Han Solo discovers Luke and keeps him alive by keeping him under the body fat of his dead Tauntaun mount, and the two are rescued by a search party the following morning. Luke as clearly matured in the three years he has been present in the Rebellion, and he see his character develop throughout. Being more independent, wiser and learning to take matters into his own hands, moulding into the Jedi that Obi Wan formerly was. The probe alerts the Imperial fleet to the Rebel's location . The Empire launches a large-scale attack using AT-AT walkers to capture the base, it was admitted that scenes featuring the large walkers took the longest to film, reasoning their slow and lethargic movements. The Rebels manage to evacuate, Han and Leia escape with C-3PO and Chewbacca on the Millennium Falcon, but the ship's hyperdrive malfunctions. They hide in an asteroid field, where Han and Leia grow closer amidst the tensions, the pair seem to attract quite easily to one another. Several Bounty Hunters, summoned by Vader, assist in searching for the the Falcon. Meanwhile, Luke travels with R2-D2 in his X-Wing to Dagobah where he crash-lands in the middle of an eerie swamp. The X-Wing used by Luke is named AA-59 and is a T-65B model. The star fighter is armoured with 4 laser cannons, 2 proton torpedo launchers and 6 proton torpedoes (crucial in the act of destroying the Death Star), weighing 110kg its class 1 hyperdrive rating allows it to be extremely flexible, fitting into narrow spaces. Luke meets with a diminutive creature whilst first plays with young Skywalker, joking around him and confusing him with his distinctive speech. He later reveals himself as Yoda, who reluctantly accepts Luke as his apprentice after conferring with Obi Wan's spirit. We visualise for the first time, the wise Jedi legend Yoda, who appears unique in his aspects. His small frame supports him as a Jedi, with his low space tee of gravity proving for good balance. His wrinkled face is deceiving to the Sith at first, but inside him is a ruthless nature. His wisdom of the Force is beyond any other Jedi, his experience manifests this. The character itself is a puppet, performed by Frank Oz who also supplies his voice, Oz is also the puppeteer behind the famous Miss Piggy, from 'The Muppets'. Luke learns more about the force from Yoda, who lifts his X-Wing out of the swamp using the power of the Force. After evading the Imperial fleet, Han's group travels to the floating Cloud City on the planet Bespin, which is governed by Han's old friend Lando Calrissian. Bounty Hunter Boba Fett, son of Jango, tracks the Falcon and, with Vader, forces Lando to hand the group over to the Empire. Boba is similar to Jango apart from his improved suit design, he aims to continue his father's legacy as a Bounty Hunter, and has a personal hatred toward the Jedi, following Jango's decapitation from Mace Windu. Vader plans to use the group as bait to lure Luke, intending to capture him and turn him to the dark side of the Force. Luke experiences a premonition of Han and Leia in pain, Yoda explains to him the importance of patience and that learning the ways of the Force takes time to master, against his and Obi Wan's wishes, Luke abandons his training to rescue them. Vader intends to hold Luke in suspended animation by imprisoning him in carbonate, selecting Han to be frozen as trial experiment, this, much to Chewbacca's discontent, taking his anger out on Lando. Han survives the process and is given to Fett, who plans to collect a bounty on him from Jabba the Hutt. The term Bounty Hunter originates from South Africa, coming from the search for HMS Bounty, the famous ship captained by William Bligh that mutinies in April 1789. This could infer to Boba Fett's armour, embodying the traditional South African colours of green and yellow. Lando, still loyal to Han, frees Leia and Chewbacca, but they are too late to stop Fett from departing with Solo. Under attack from numerous stormtroopers, they fight their way back to the Falcon and flee the city. Meanwhile, Luke arrives and engages Vader in a tense lightsaber duel that leads them to the city's central air shaft, Vader appearing more defensive than offensive. Vader severs Luke's right arm, significant as the same happened to Anakin when in combat with Dooku. After Darth Vader disarms the young Jedi, he tempts him to embrace his anger and join the Dark side of the Force. Luke reiterates Obi Wan's telling, accusing the Sith Lord of murdering his father, metaphorically speaking that is true. Vader reveals that he is Luke's father, in 'four words' best known to the film. Horrified, Luke drops into the air shaft and is ejected beneath the floating city, hanging from an antenna. In a mixture of mental states, he reaches out telepathically to Leia, who senses him and persuades Lando and Chewy to turn back. After Luke is brought aboard, they are chased by TIE fighters towards Vader on his Star Destroyer and finds out that the Falcon's hyperdrive has been tampered with, but the confident, intelligent droid R2-D2 reactivates it, allowing them to escape. Luke rejoins the Rebel fleet and his severed hand is replaced with a robotic prosthesis, just like his father's previously. Lando and Chewbacca begin their quest to save Han, as the other Rebels watch in unison as the Falcon departs. Episode 5 sees the first confrontation of Luke and his father, Darth Vader and makes for an exciting next chapter to how he, being the only accessible Jedi left, will go about defeating the evil Sith Lord. Leia and Han's relationship expands in the screenplay, but of course is cut short due to Vader's experiment involving the pilot. This situation isn't resolved in the film and supplies a strong costarring base for the next chapter. An incredibly directed film, shows the Rebel alliance growing stronger and replacing the former 'Republic', allowing it to compete with the Galactic Empire. Vader's truth is out and just like Palpatine, his quest to turn Luke to the Dark Side, is his priority.",

523,6 August 2010,philthegreatone-786-63058,10, This is a true masterpiece,"This is in my opinion the best of the original trilogy. Luke is becoming aware of him having Jedi powers. His spaceship gets stuck in the swamp and he can't get it out. He meets a new interesting wise character called Yoda. Yoda asks Luke if he can levitate the spaceship out of the swamp. Luke says ill try. Yoda then say's do or do not there is no try.. this explains the power of positive thinking. Yoda is able to lift the spaceship out of the swamp. Now onto our friend Darth Vadar who is arguably the best villain of all time.He wants Luke to join him and rule the galaxy with the dark side. Luke doesn't want this and resists Vadar's attempt to turn Luke. There are so many great sequences in this film. For example when Han Solo fly's through the wave of asteroids. The special effects at the time were revolutionary. The performances are solid Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fischer as Princess Leia and Harrison Ford as Han Solo. This is a true masterpiece of cinema that will live through the ages. If you haven't experienced this saga then I suggest you go out and rent or even buy the trilogy now",

527,25 October 2019,MrPupkin,10, By far the best of the Star Wars saga.,"Proof that if George Lucas wants his intellectual property to grow and flourish, he should lay the ground work and then take a step back and let it develop on its own. This is evident in the leap in story depth and character development from A New Hope to Empire Strikes Back. Maybe he should have let someone else take over screenplay writing and directing after Phantom Menace. This film really does get deeper into the characters and is definitely the best film in the first trilogy. Sets are extraordinary and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian (aka the only black guy in George Lucas's universe) was excellent. They ended the film in a perfect place making the audience crave to know what happens next. The film gives us a chance to grow even more with the characters from A New Hope and has a massive reveal toward the end (at least to those that saw it in the 80s).",
528,30 March 2020,krational66,8, An excellent sequel.,"This one proves why the Star Wars series can last. What Lucas did was not only show the most advanced special effects technology at the time, but also not only build a complicated galaxy world, but actually did it.
Everything an epic movie should have:the most classic elements of slapstick, joyful enemies, father and son, and apprenticeship between master and apprentice are cleverly combined.

The stand alone sequel brings together events that will unfold for the rest of the series. The special effects are a tremendous highlight, the story tells itself with power, darkness and grit. we get our first look at the manical AT-AT walkers and their abilities to destroy. we also get a first look at Dagoba and the isolation Yoda has put himself in. The realism of who Luke's father comes to light and how he battles that jolt is intensified in the next film. I certainly rate this with a 9.",
530,6 December 2000,Indy-52,10, BEST action/adventure film ever!,"THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK totally surprised me after the disappointment that was STAR WARS. I rented the film as a curiosity item, but found it very boring and uninteresting. So I wasn't so keen on renting the next episode, but since so many people said it was so much better than the first, I tried it. And I was blown away by it. It was so good, I even bought it. Now I've seen it dozens of times. I never expected it to be so good! I was totally amazed by the effects (great for their time!), the action & adventure and the exciting story. This one moves much faster than STAR WARS. Irvin Kershner is a much better storyteller than George Lucas. I still wonder why he chose not to direct this one and leave it in the hands of someone else. It's the same thing Steven Spielberg directing all of the Indiana Jones films. But I'm happy Lucas made that choice. This movie probably wouldn't have turned as good as it did. It's hard to describe what's so good about this movie and the way it makes you feel as you're watching it. The most important feeling it gives me is the sense of wonder. The space battles are truly breathtaking, and are better than anything else you see in movies today. I think it's safe to say that they truly don't make them like they used to. Hollywood forgot that the most important thing in an action & adventure film is caring about the people who are in danger and creating interesting characters. I don't think we'll ever see another movie like TESB again.",
531,6 November 1999,Indy-52,10, BIG improvement over the first one,"this movie had much more imagination than the first film. It has a lot of action and it explores the feelings of the characters and many other planets of the Galaxy. Great sets, great sword fights, great cruel Darth Vader and lots of new characters. Interesting relationship between Luke and Yoda. A darker more serious tone, with good people becoming evil. These are the good parts of the movie. A great disappointment was the ending, because there wasn't one. The battle scenes on Cloud City were  too long. All in all, the second best of the trilogy, after Return of the Jedi.",

537,23 March 2005,freaky_dave,10, Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars,"The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars. They are two of the best Science Fiction Films of all time, so I found it hard to decide which was the better film. Upon reviewing both for the umpteenth time, I discovered that The Empire Strikes Back had a more rounded storyline. We also found out the mystery of Darth Vader along with better development of all the other characters in the movie. And lets not forget that we were introduced to Yoda as well. I give both films a 10, but if I had to decide, The Empire Strikes Back would win hands down. It was too bad that George Lucas sold out a little with Return Of The Jedi, but I still found that the entire trilogy is one of the best in Science Fiction. Yes, The Empire Strikes Back was much darker, but that was likely why it was the better movie, and Return Of The Jedi the lesser of the three. Still, all three are better than the newer films, but Revenge of The Sith hasn't been released yet, and it sounds real good. So I'm on wait and see mode for the final film. Here's hoping it's better than Phantom Menace and Attack of The Clones. Two films that I still enjoyed, but not as much as the earlier ones.",
538,20 August 2008,kyle-cruse,10, The greatest sequel of all time,"Like the original ""Star Wars"" film, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" always finds itself inside my top ten. It's extremely close in quality to ""A New Hope,"" but I place this film just slightly below that one. This is however, in my opinion, the greatest sequel ever made. Like all great sequels, it doesn't try to be too much like its original. This film has a completely different feel to it, and it proves to be far more dramatic and intense than the last film. In this film we are introduced to one of the most well-known and most-imitated characters of the saga (and movies in general), Yoda. This character brings about not only some of the most humorous bits of the movie, but also some of the most important and challenging ones. It has a bit of a slow start, which is really the only reason I rate it less than the original. I'm not really sure why I prefer the original, but there are few circumstances when I like a sequel almost as much as the first film. The lightsaber battle at the end is probably the most intense one in the entire saga, and if you are unaware of how it turns out, watch it now and find out. This is the only perfect sequel in movie history, in my opinion. A definite favorite of mine.",

As every true geek knows, George Lucas liked the book ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"" by Joseph Campbell so much that he incorporated many influences from it into the Star Wars script. Campbell studied myths and religions from around the world and he realized that there is a story that is repeated insistently in many cultures because it seems to convey a very important knowledge about the human soul. It is what has been called the ""Hero's Journey"" or ""Monomyth"". So Lucas wrote the Star Wars script following the steps of this mythical story.",

541,18 September 2014,orourkec-292-269155,7," Thrilling, but it needs to dig deeper into the idea of the Force.","Well, well. Not bad at all this film. I thought that Empire Strikes Back was a good motion picture and an improvement over A New Hope which I completely disliked. What's good about Empire Strikes Back is that it is more involving than its predecessor, it is fresh, dark, sinister, emotional and unpredictable in an original and great way but what comes as a particularly interesting subplot in this film is the daring, slick, ironic, manipulative, show-off and comedic dialog shared between Han Solo and Princess Leia. We witness awesome moments whenever it is only the two of them talking together alone in what looks like a romance moment between the two of them. And also the good thing is that the romance and dialogs between them is not over-the-top as some people might expect from a part romance film. And Harrison Ford is impeccably well cast as Han Solo in this movie, both in his acting and his looks and he is ultimately an exceptionally interesting character. And Darth Vader he isn't bad either. He is perfect as a villain: he is obsessed to catch the rebels that won a victory over his Galactic Empire three years earlier and he also punishes his commanders that involuntarily fail him in his attempt to catch the rebels by strangling them by the use of the Force. And he is also beautifully voiced by James Earl Jones though to be honest his small accent bothered me a bit and it harmed his beautiful and haunting voice as Darth Vader a bit. Actually, I think I will not consider it as a flaw as a matter of fact because of his beautiful and haunting voice and I think that his beautiful and haunting voice is enough to undo the flaw. Well done on all that. And last but not least...the sound. The sound was absolutely fantastic in this movie and it arguably deserved the Academy Award for Best Sound which it won. One thing I think should have been improved in this Star Wars movie would have been to dig deeper into the idea of the Force. My rating for Empire Strikes Back is 7.2/10",

This film is a follow up to one of the biggest grossing movies of all time.  To tell you the truth, this movie was not that great.

547,16 May 2019,PCT1970,9, Hands Down The Best In The Star Wars Saga To This Day,"Any ""Star Wars"" fan will tell you this film is hands down the best in the saga. Kershner and Kasden created a masterpiece. The direction, cinematography, screenplay, special effects, score and acting are superlative. The score plays just as an important role as the characters as it adds to the intensity, and adventurous tone of the film. The story continues between the rebel forces and the evil empire. Luke is introduced to Yoda who tutors him in the way of the Jedi. The rebel forces are in immenent danger and Luke cuts his training short to join the rebels in their battle. He encounters the ominous Darth Vader and family secrets are finally revealed. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film it is almost impossible to choose a favorite. If I had to it would be the scene where Luke must decide on accepting the truth or risk plunging to his death. The plot is crisp, insightful, duplicitous, thrilling, cathartic and has an ambiguous ending. It is an ingenious film and remains one of the very best films in the science fiction genre. This film influenced this viewer to remain a fan even after having to endure the inferior Episodes 1, 2 and 3.",
548,22 December 2016,cdjh-81125,10, The Definitive Step Up Sequel,"When talking about sequels that improved ten fold over their originals The Empire Strikes Back will always rightfully be mentioned because this is a film that takes its characters to whole new levels of intrigue and development and places them in a vulnerable position and is a masterpiece. For one this films opening is possibly the best of the entire franchise, we are perfectly re introduced to these characters and understand were they all are, we see exactly how they are dealing with the events of the first film and they brilliantly spend this first act building up to the Empires attack in Hoth which gives the battle itself a whole new level of intensity. This first battle is incredible, we feel the scale and power of the empire from all perspectives making you realise just how powerful they really are and how much the Rebel Alliance are up against. When we get past this battle the film is split into two separate arcs that are cut together and told perfectly, there's never a moment we're the audience is bored with either story as the characters along with the storytelling make both of them just as entertaining and satisfying as each other. Luke's time on Dagobah is incredibly intriguing, the way this film talks about the Jedi and The Force is extremely well done it makes them seem more deeper than mere warriors and the inclusion of Jedi Master Yoda was a very good way of emphasising this as it shows the enlightenment The Force can bring. The other arc of this movie cantering around Han Solo and Princess Leia on the run from the empire is extremely entertaining with seamless special effects and a much more intimate and character driven story than the previous instalment, the romance that eventually develops is done just right it feels natural as well as not forced and the chemistry between the two is impeccable. When we finally get to the last act of this film it's all come together perfectly to create for a nail baiting final show down. The fight between Darth Vader and Luke is absolutely incredible, not only the mental but physical war that goes on between the two is so satisfying, the famous reveal doesn't see out of field but plausible and the ending was not entirely satisfactory as it left the characters in a questionable position that sets up for a better place for a sequel.

I prefer The Empire Strikes Back to Star Wars because there is a twist in the tale which shocked me to the core. The special effects are just so awesome that they just hold your attention. All the regulars return Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia etc but there are some new ones too, like Lando Clarissan. In my opinion George Lucas should have stopped at number 3 because it has become more of a money making machine. The Phanthom Menace was OK, Attack of the Clones was bad whilst Revenge of the Sith was an improvement. Empire Strikes Back was easily the best of the Star Wars Franchise.",

Perhaps the writing in The Empire Strikes Back is the most iconic over any other Star Wars film. On this last rewatch I was still so amazed with how well the special effects were.

Also Harrison Ford, Mark Hammil and Carrie Fisher are more comfortable in their roles, probably because they are more confident in this films quality than the first one, because they seen the outcome of Star Wars finished product. I love this film and I hope Episode 2 Attack of the Clones can top it (fingers crossed!). Billy Dee Williams role also makes a great addition to the cast, oh and of course Boba Fett first appears in this one, and that character is the coolest of all the Star Wars characters, ***SPOILER*** just a pity he was killed so cheaply in Return of the Jedi. Maybe Star Wars films are better off when Lucas himself doesn't direct them?, I hope not what with as I write this less than a month from Episode 2.

563,2 August 2019,reddragonhero17,10, The Dark Side of the Universe is the finest in the saga,"I've been watching Star Wars movies since the age of 5 and though I regard Return of the Jedi as my favorite of the entire series (even topping off the prequel and sequel series), I cannot deny the amount of artistry and storytelling ability this one has. There's a lot of character development and pathos between all the heroes we love and the villains that we want them to confront. I like the fact that the heroes don't always win, gives them a greater chance for us to root for them. rather than have an invincible boring set of heroes. The show stealer here is Yoda himself. Forget the CGI versions, the puppetry and wisdom he exudes in his words are timeless, my favorite is the famous line ""Do or do not, there is not try"". Truer words never said better. When Darth Vader says the famous line, you're going to be wondering what decision Luke will have to do next. I won't reveal anything, but from all of what I have said you'll return to this movie time and time again.",

565,4 July 2005,kagrisier,9," For me, the weakest of the Originals, but the most enjoyable...","Face it. Once you see ""Star Wars"" (or Episode IV, for all you ""Special"" Edition lovers) at least 54 times, everything sort of drags on. Once you see ""Return of the Jedi"", it kind of drags along, but, even though it is the longest, it seems to be the shortest. While ""Empire"" is VERY slow, it is easily the darkest and most enjoyable movie from the Original Trilogy, but for me, the least. As with ""Star Wars"" I'm gonna start the review with the Special Edition stuff. We don't need to see the ""VERY"" interesting approach to the Star Destroyer. The extra Wampa scene builds MUCH more tension than the original. And making Luke scream like a baby was Definitely cool. So, like the original ""Star Wars"" DON'T BUY OR WATCH THE SPECIAL EDITION! Again, I am proud to be the lucky owner of the original 3 movies unwrapped, and in mint condition after my success on ebay. I think it is obvious that The Empire Strikes Back is the darkest, including the fact that it has the stunning (MAJOR spoilers ahead!) ""I am your father!"" by James Earl Jones. As for the acting in this movie, second strongest, (Return of the Jedi has the strongest,in my opinion). Best actor/actress here- Frank Oz as Yoda. Well, he didn't really act, but oh, well. Againg, the effects in the Original Edition don't stick out like a sore thumb like in the Special Edition. The sets have gone a small, almost unnoticeable change: They don't look used! While many may argue that snow and woods can't look used (and I agree with them), Cloud City certainly can, and I think that there wasn't a scuff mark until the Stormtroopers attacked! Again, the music is GREAT! This time, my second favorite track, ""The Imperial March"" is introduced, and my fifth favorite, ""Yoda's Theme"" is introduced. Again, the DVD is fine (Luke doesn't scream), and I recommend it over the ""Special"" Edition. But, I recommend the Original Edition above all. May the Force be with you as you watch this movie!",

There's much more character devolopment and the characters are fleshed out more. The movie takes a darker tone with the fate of Han Solo and the big revelation regarding Luke and Darth Vader.

A disappointing movie becomes an unholy dumpster fire and a solid sequel becomes an undisputed masterpiece. The Empire Strikes Back is certainly overrated. It's a great film, as are all the Star Wars movies (the six that count anyway), but Episode V is not a dramatic step up from A New Hope or any of the other films in the saga. The movie has become so overrated that many say it's not just the best Star Wars movie, but the only Star Wars movie that is any good at all. People are dumb. And I want to take the contrarian stance, but let's face facts, The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect sequel to the landmark movie event that was Star Wars. It deepens the mythology, lending George Lucas' world a gravity and psychological weight not seen in the buoyant original. It's also just as quirky and clunky as any other Star Wars film, so let us not rewrite history. TESB is a great film, a great Star Wars film, possibly the best of the six, but not the overwhelming triumph of the series that SO many people claim it to be.",

Topping the first film (A New Hope) seemed impossible, but George Lucas and Irvin Kershner did it in 1980 with EMPIRE. A darker, deeper, more elaborate action packed film that skillfully tells two inter-connected stories as characters from the original movie are powerfully developed.  Luke Skywalker comes of age and realizes a terrible family secret.  Princess Liea and Han Solo try every means of evading the Empire but eventually end up in Darth Vader's hands.  The climax of the film is unforgettable and the special effects are not only impressive even by today's standards, but perfectly serve to tell this incredible story.

Producer/writer George Lucas (who also directed the first film) decided to pass the directorial duties over to semi-avant guard director Irvin Kershner (best known at the time for 1970's LOVING and 1972's UP THE SANDBOX), which proved to be an ingenious move. Kershner's dramatic background serves him well in helming the complex plot, and he pulls fully-rounded characterizations from the entire cast.

The acting, the effects, directing, plot, everything was just perfect. The acting is great and these characters were already likable in the previous movie, but here there is much more chemistry between them, they feel like they are real and you care about them much, much more. George Lucas isn't directing this time, but Irvin Kershner did a great job and directed the best Star Wars movie of all time! About the effects, I mostly think the same I thought about the previous movie. They are ahead of it's time, they aged well, and it was all practical, but it's so hard to believe. John Williams made a perfect score to the movie and here we are introduced to a theme of the Empire. There is especially that one unforgettable scene when that music plays and it fits perfectly. The plot is emotional, intense and that twist at the end will stick with you for a long time (of course, if someone didn't already spoil it to you). It's foreshadowing the next movie and sets it up in such a good way that it's impossible to top it. While the other movies have their flaws, this one is flawless and watchable over and over again.

This film has interesting elements like the Lightsaber fight between Darth Vader and Luke; the secret romance of Leia and Han Solo that is expressed in the end, etc. A balancing counterpart of the earlier part this shows First Order on the higher side while resistance tries to gain through Luke as the last hope. Luke find his way to Dagobah where he has interesting meet with Master Yoda who begins his training but that does not complete due to the his call on saving his friends Leia and Han. Luke manages to escape after a breathtaking fight as Leia helps with his rescue.

I have heard some people say that The Empire Strikes Back is the weakest of the trilogy, and that it suffers for being in the middle. I would dispute this utterly. For one thing, the plot has a slightly different format to the other two: instead of the old destroy-a-death-star scenario, we have the chance to learn more about the galaxy in general and to explore the characters in more depth. This is the film in which a lot of key character relationships are forged in earnest. It also includes, in my opinion, the best light sabre sequences: Alec Guiness may be a super actor, but he's not desperately nimble, whilst we do not have the same confidence in Luke as we do in Return of the Jedi.",

602,5 December 2016,MustafaDilek,6, Sorry not for our Generations (After Nineties),"The story (if you can speak of one)in this movie is very boring. There isn't any tension-building or climax whatsoever. The movie just stops after 2 hours. There is hardly any character building, and to my opinion there aren't many strong personalities. The only character that has won my sympathy is Han Solo,(Harrison Ford) but after being frozen he just disappears out of the movie, and no one seems to care about him anymore. Luke Skywalker is a w***er who is supposed to be a jedi knight, but instead he needs to be rescued all the time. I wouldn't have cared less if he had crashed in his plane, had been eaten by that snowmonster, had frozen to death, he got shot by the ATATs, if his father had killed him, or he had fallen of that tower. The music score is well composed, though I think a classical symphony isn't very suitable for a sci-fi movie. I believe they should have used synthetic music to create the right atmosphere.

We see that Darth Vader is evil, but not as pure evil as we might have expected in the first movie.

Darth Vader tells Luke he's his daddy, Han Solo is frozen in cryptanite, we are introduced to Yoda, and more is learned about Jedi. I think George Lucas put this trilogy out first because the twists are too good to already know they are coming. He does such a good job putting all this on the screen, i can't believe he didn't win Best Director, and it's even more shocking that neither this nor it's predecessor won Best Picture. What was the Academy thinking? Anyway, most of the cast returns and the special effects, while now severely outdated, are good for it's time. The Special Edition has to be the best thing to ever come to Star Wars fans (until the highly anticipated DVDs). The sfx are redone and the picture quality is enhanced. The Battle on Hoth and the escape from Cloud City are two of the best scenes ever filmed. Empire Strikes Back is the best in the series and one the best films of all time. 10/10",

Story, character development, special effects, and musical score. The ability to create an entire universe that still pulls in an audience over 25 years later.

This is truly one of the best sequels I have ever seen, not only as a Star Wars film, but as one of the best sequels in the history of film making. Like the granddaddy of all sequels, The Godfather Part II, The Empire Strikes Back takes the original, develops it and continues with it but is not afraid to go into darker places. We have Hans Solo being frozen alive, Luke being told that Darth Vader is his actual father and to top it all of he has his arm chopped of by him. As kid's films go, this is brilliant and dark. If the first film was like the magician's trick, this is more like a Shakespearean play, a hint of tragedy taking hold of proceedings. The characters are taken on more darker paths throughout the narrative that leads to a frightening downbeat cliffhanger. There is a sense of maturity in the proceedings here. Maybe it comes with a different director using the special effects tools in a more mature manner of different writers, but the more superficial problems that the first film had are gone here. The acting is much, much better, Mark Hamill putting in a brilliant portrayal of a Luke that is finding his life taking a more darker turn than before. The chemistry between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford retains some of the more fun and light hearted aspects, but then this leads to a darker pay off and a scene of sheer emotional intensity it is almost blinding.

""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" ranks as my second favorite ""Star Wars"" film, following closely behind ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"". Most fans would disagree with my arrangement of favorites, yet I don't believe any would disagree with this film getting an outrageous score. That's right.

The opening snow battle (with those insanely elephantine Imperial Walkers) and the chase scene amidst the asteroids are as thrilling as any scenes in the ""quadrilogy"". But what especially draws me in is the heaviness that seems to imbue just about every frame and every line the actors speak. This is quite a (welcome) jolt from the whiz bang frivolity that wins over Episodes 1, 4 & 6. I don't know how much of this tonal change (if you will) was brought to the material by director Irvin Kershner or how much it had to do with the necessary downturn in the script that was pre-ordained to end in the Darth Vader's favor. Whatever or whoever was responsible added psychological muscle to an already hyperactive story. I also loved the deepening relationship between Princess Leia and Han Solo. Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford generate some real electricity, albeit confused and awkward (until the end, of course), in the middle of all the other excitement. In fact I think that one of the most romantic scenes in movie history comes when the Princess declares her love for Han just before he gets carbonized and he replies that he knows her feelings. What could have come off as terribly smart alecky and arrogant instead resonates with reciprocation and desparation the way Ford says his line. This romance is what really carries this movie for me. Finally John William's score is among his all-time best and with or without the movie absolutely soars.",

The same argument does not (indeed, can not) apply to The Empire Strikes Back. It starts on an exciting note, and the excitement never slows down. What's wrong then? The beginning is just too confusing! A while passed between the two films, and Luke's voice sounds somewhat different. So for about the first 10 minutes of the movie, (where no faces are shown, and only Han Solo's name was mentioned) I was wondering: ""Is it really him? Or was it someone else?"" Omitting that confusing first 10 minutes, this movie was, to be perfectly honest, amazing. The acting really improved, I think, from the original. I positively loved Billy Dee Williams (who should've played Two-Face in Batman III) in this movie. James Earl Jones, who delivered a fantastic performance in the original, was even better here. (Darth Vader's sardonic line ""Apology accepted"" was just amazingly delivered!) He was even scarier, I'd say. Harrison Ford's character was a little more developed, as was Carrie Fisher's. Mark Hamill did a great job, too.",

The film series, consisting of two trilogies (and an upcoming third), has spawned an extensive media franchise called the Expanded Universe including books, television series, computer and video games, and comic books. These supplements to the franchise resulted in significant development of the series' fictional universe, keeping the franchise active in the 16- year interim between the two film trilogies. The franchise depicts a galaxy described as ""far, far away"" in the distant past, and commonly portrays Jedi as a representation of good, in conflict with the Sith, their evil counterpart.

While I can't personally say it's the best film of the Saga, it comes pretty darn close.",

684,28 August 2020,andrewnmiller,10, A sequel done right.,"Following the massive success for the first Star Wars film, George Lucas had hoped to become independent from the Hollywood system in choosing to finance the budget from the other two sequels himself. To develop the story for Empire Strikes Back, Lucas brought on sci-fi writer Leah Brackett to write the screenplay. In the first draft, Brackett would have Luke's father appear as a spirit to Luke thus tying into the backstory provided in A New Hope. Upon reading Leah's screenplay, George was less than pleased but before he could meet with her and fix the script, Brackett passed away thus leaving Lucas to write the next draft himself but he brought on Lawrence Kasden to reanalyze the screenplay. Unlike A New Hope, Lucas chose not to direct Empire Strikes Back because he was focused on running Lucasfilm as a business, overseeing the VFX company Industrial Light and Magic, and financing other Lucasfilm projects. George then offered the director's chair to his old film mentor, Irvin Kirschner. Known for more character-driven films like The Eyes of Laura Mars, Kirschner had never directed a blockbuster before and he originally rejected the offer, fearing the sequel wouldn't match the standard of the original film. When he called his agent, though, he later accepted the job at his agent's behest. Shooting for Empire Strikes Back began in Norway in early 1979 where they encountered the worst storm in 50 years with temperatures of -20 degrees and 18 feet of snow. On one occasion, the crew were unable to leave their hotel to shoot a scene of Luke escaping the Wampa cave so Irvin was able to achieve a shot involving Luke's exit of the Wampa cave by opening the hotel's doors and filming Mark Hamill running out into the snow while the crew remained warm inside. When the film opened in June of 1980, it did incredibly well at the box office and with moviegoers, but critics were mixed on the film, but over time, the film has been received far more positively and is now considered by many to be the best out of the entire Star Wars saga.",

The action scenes are put together very well. This is one of my favorite movie sequels. If you love Star Wars or sci/fi's or movies period, you should have this in your movie collection very soon.

696,4 November 2001,watto124,10, A taste of film and imagination heaven.,"""The Empire Strikes Back"", if not the best film ever made, is merely the best Star Wars film ever made. I seriously doubt Lucas will top this. Ever. The way the story is told continues to astound me. The darkness of it all. The adventure, danger, and drama that consists in the film's universe has yet to be paralelled (I don't it will be). In terms of acting, its pretty well orchestrated. In terms of special effects, it's amazing. In terms of music, it has some of Williams' best. In terms of script, it's wonderous (at least after the ""laser-brain"" scene). In terms of story, it's the best. In terms of characters? Well, lets just say it's uncanny. The way the characters unfold in their adventures and the true revealing of Vader's mind is fascinating. The film won't please impatient kids all that much. It is a mature movie through and through. Not in terms of content, but in terms of understanding. There's no Jar Jar, Jawas, or Ewoks in this one. The title explains it all and the end result leaves one in a semi-depressed stupor while also giving the viewer a sense of hope. Everything works in this one somehow, whether it's the story, locations, characters (Boba Fett and Yoda, for example), music, or awesomesness of the villains. It all accumulates into one word: fantastic.",

699,10 October 2017,skoloman,7, Improved but not perfect,"i wanted to see the star wars trilogy and look at it with a critical eye. so when i watched this movie i expected anything. the movie was pretty fine and definitely an improvement over the previous one. though i don't have too much to say about this movie. i'd mostly say the same that i said about the first (fourth) one. so this review will be more or less minimal 1. the story: what i appreciate is that this is a ,,good'' sequel. it's what a sequel should be: a continuation. this is a pretty good continuation. it's not a rehash of the first one and the story itself is quite decent. also the most iconic star wars moments come from this movie. 2. the characters: the characters are for the most part. just like in the last one (especially the best character Han solo) but in this part Luke's character has actually grown a bit as he was learning to become a Jedi and use the ,,force'' or basically to become an omnipotent space wizard. Darth Vader and Chewbacca got to really shine in this movie and were infinitely better than in the predecessor. also Yoda was introduced and he was fine i guess. 3. the action: thankfully this movie didn't have a lot of storm-trooper shootout scenes. this is probably the biggest improvement over the last movie. the last movie had very boring action with no stakes since the storm-troopers literally miss every shot they take. here we only had one storm-trooper shootout and it was pretty quick. summary: fine movie. better than the last one but still grossly overrated. the biggest problem with these movies is that they are in the middle of kids movies and adult sci-fi",

This was the Star Wars I wanted with the original, and it was extremely satisfying. In The Empire Strikes Back, the Galactic empire is on the hunt for Luke Skywalker and the rest of the Rebel Alliance. While Darth Vader is chasing Han Solo, Princess Leia and others across the galaxy, Luke studies the force under Jedi Master Yoda. Structurally, the film isn't as controlled as A New Hope, featuring long action scenes intertwined with dialog-heavy scenes of characterization, but that's an easily forgiven issue. The intense action scenes and darker plot make this a more involving film than its predecessor, and the young actors seemed a lot more confident in their roles. The Empire Strikes Back is an exciting film from start to finish, especially during the final thirty minutes when Luke faces off with Darth Vader. George Lucas really knows how to make a memorable climax. Although it does get a little cheesy right at the end, The Empire Strikes Back is a great improvement to its predecessor, and it set a high bar for movie sequels.",

This film fleshes out its main characters, giving them so much more depth. Luke's training with the incredible Yoda, allowed him to learn important lessons and wisdom.

With a huge success like A New Hope, making a sequel worthy to it was very tough...unless the makers put their mind to it...and they did. George Lucas did not direct this and he found a great direct with Irvin K. who made this film more human in nature than the first film. In fact, character expression here is the best and so is the character development...both the best in the series.

740,29 November 2000,stiv-7,10," If Episode II is this good, I can't wait","This one will always be my personal favourite of the original Star Wars Trilogy, mostly because it is the best. Everything really came together here; so much so, that even George Lucas didn't change that much for the Special Edition, and what he did change only served to enhance the greatness that was already there. Probably the most notable difference between this one and the original Star Wars was in the writing, by the late Leigh Brackett and the then-neophyte Lawrence Kasdan. Brackett had a great way with a putdown, but not to the point of simply being snarky. Lines like ""I'd just as soon kiss a Wookie!"""" I can easily arrange that; you could use a good kiss!"" serve as punctuation, and not the entire point of the film. This is why irony is dying its currently slow and painful death: a lack of skill and judgement in the use of insults, sarcasm, and other putdowns. This film has the great banter of an old Bogart-Bacall film, which also gave it an edge back in 1980, when so few intelligent films were being released. When the best banter of the year is coming from a space opera, that's pretty dire, but I digress. To critics of my point of view, yes this film is a downer, but that's what makes it so great. As the middle act, it shouldn't have a happy ending, and that's what will be so cool about Episodes II and III.

The movie goes light years ahead from the first in every way; special effects that to this day even look better those modern sci/fi movies of today. The characters are defined and the saga really begins in this epic story. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Leia suffer difficult and effective changes though out the movie. The introduction of Yoda as the tinny Jedi master was amazing, the former smuggler, and Solo's best friend Lando as a two face allied was perfect. The fearsome and imposing Darth Vader with his deep voice is for me the best performance of James Earl Jones ever. The light saber duel between Luke and Vader was dramatic and surprising. And the revelation ""no, I am your father"" it has become a pop culture phenomenon. Empire is the best of all the 6 film succeeding where others have failed.",

The battles were cool and led to many videogames. Han's romance with Leia had nice progress. Yoda was awesome as a teacher. I would prefer just a better training to Luke. It felt rushed and the results were bad because of it. A great movie anyway that makes you want to see how the trilogy will end. If the purpose was to make the heroes seem in a very bad situation with no hope of winning it succeeded its course. For some reason I enjoyed New Hope more. Maybe I don't like bad guys winning idk,

Lucas proves himself to be the master of story once again, and the performances are all classic: Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, James Earl Jones, Carrie Fischer, and many others are all classic portrayals now. The romance is well built, the action holds up well, and the stakes feel real in a gripping third act. The dark tone boosts the gritty aspect of the film even more.

747,24 January 2016,darioilg,7, One of the best sequels in the history of cinema,"The incredible, universal success of ""Star Wars"" in 1977 was a big incentive for George Lucas and his squad to deliver a sequel that could cover them in money just like the first did and that could satisfy fans and critics. The final result was (and is) a fantastic movie, arguably the best sequel ever in this kind of cinematic experience. As Lucas left the writing job to his fellow storyteller Lawrence Kasdan (very possibly the real mastermind behind the most amusing lines, considering the awful job Lucas did all alone with the prequels), the adventure is just as iconic as ""A New Hope"", but with a darker and somewhat more mature mood, as the title suggests. If ""Star Wars"" was an epic poem, and in some ways it is, this film should be considered its ""discentio ad inferos"", that is the lowest moment for the hero, who then rises from its ashes and manages to win once and for all (""Return of the Jedi""): both Han Solo and Luke Skywalker find themselves in great danger at the hands of Darth Vader, a character that immediately grows in depth after one of the last scenes, which is also one of the most famous scenes (and worst quoted lines) in the history of cinema and possibly the best idea to come from George Lucas's mind. One possible mistake could have been to recycle our beloved characters in cheap fashion, but instead everyone of them grows and gets more defined through the story and we are introduced to yet some other iconic members of this wonderful universe, like Master Yoda, Lando Calrissian and the baddest bounty hunter ever, Boba Fett. On top of all that, John Williams's music is just as fantastic as the first time around, modelling itself to the more grim atmosphere.",

The Empire Strikes Back is a much darker, more interesting and more action-packed version of A New Hope. The lightsaber duels are much more intense and interesting. It's much more of a sword fight than tapping lightsabers like the last movie. I also love how threatening the empire was in this movie. In the last movie, they weren't all that intimidating. Here however, they were a little scary! All the new characters are just as amazing as the characters introduced in the last movie. Boba Fett is memorable, the emperor is awesome, Lando Calrissian is interesting and Yoda is a classic character. The old characters are also very well developed. Luke is learning more about the ways of the Jedi, a romance is blooming between Han Solo and Leia and Darth Vader is much more intimidating. The scenes with Yoda and even Obi Wan teaching Luke the ways of the Jedi are extremely interesting to the audience. It's some really clever world- building. I won't spoil the huge twist in this movie for the 3 people who haven't seen this movie but I will say that your mind will be blown!

I think it is almost as good. I think that the only reason that you guys think this is the best is because Lucas did not direct. But this one has great dialogue, and some of the acting is better. It introduces a lot more of unforgettable characters like Yoda, and Lando, and the emperor. Yoda rocks. So does the emperor. and Lando. It is the darkest of all 6 films in my opinion and the most mature. So, It is a great movie and the greatest sequel ever. MPAA Rating:PG. My MPAA Rating:PG-13.

It has been chanted from the highest hilltops and the most well known critic sites on the internet. It has been said time and time again. Star Wars Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back is not only the best Star Wars movie, but the best movie sequel ever made, and a prime example of how follow ups can match up and even prevail over their predecessors. While I like the prequels and the film that started it all in 77, The Empire Strikes Back has always been the SW film that glowed the most for me and had the best scenes out of the entire saga. It also introduced my all time favorite Star Wars character and my favorite movie character in general, brought to life by a man who based the character's look and facial expressions off his own. The Empire Strikes Back is the ideal Star Wars film for me, and although it received a mixed reception when it was first released, it has garnished a monstrosity of a following these last couple decades and it shines as one of the greatest sci-fi thrillers with loads of twists and turns to quench your thirst.

The Yoda we see here is a wise mystic who lives on a far off planet and teaches young Luke Skywalker to be a Jedi. Unlike the Yoda we've seen in the recent prequels, this Yoda is far better and is believable that he is a true Jedi Master.

So as we're closing the LOTR trilogy this season, I was reminded of another trilogy - one that sparked the imaginations of many filmmakers to come, and really made films like RETURN OF THE KING possible. After all, if the second Star Wars movie had bombed, trilogies in big budget filmmaking would probably not have been a popular consideration afterward.

784,21 May 2019,nirome,10, Amazing follow up and a master class in how to make a sequel,"Although, if we're being fair, this is definitely the movie that made me fall in love with the saga. True, I'd already seen the original Star Wars and even though I'd quite liked that movie, it wasn't until I'd seen this one that I really fell for the saga. And all of this, mainly because, in almost every level, this movie is clearly superior to the original. The tone is darker, the characters' story arcs are better developed ( the love triangle only hinted at in the first movie is finally resolved, Luke's path as a Jedi and his ultimate and painful discovery of his origins), and the multiple twists and turns of the plot takes the story to very interesting places. It's this journey of love and self-discovery, coupled with the amazing use of its visual elements ( production values on this one were clearly taken up a notch) that makes this, not only the ultimate Star Wars movie, but also the ultimate sequel. John William's score is ,once again, astounding. Due to, not in small measure, a very well written script by Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett, George Lucas's involvement only being in the general plotting of the storyline, the movie gains a level of mastery sadly never achieved with the following sequels. Of special significance are the Planet Hoth battle, the Millenium Falcon chase by the Imperial Fleet through an asteroid field and the ultimate confrontation between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker on the Cloud City of Bespin, where it takes place one of the most shocking reveals in cinematographic history.
This is clearly an example of the sequel being quite superior to the original. I put it up there with The Godfather 2 and Terminator 2, to name just two of the most popular examples. Great movie and an absolute blast of enjoyment.",

Darth Vader telling Luke he is his Father never gets old no matter how many times you watch it. You do see Luke becoming more mature in this movie,Mark Hamil did such a great job with him.Even after all these years the effects are still great,they don't look dated and never takes you away from the story. Something I think many filmmakers could use a lesson in,effects should be used to enhance a story,not be the base of the story. While the effects were cool,that's not what I remember about Star Wars.

The genius of the trilogy(yes-it remains a trilogy until Lucas makes up for that Phantom Menace crap) is the way it effortlessly draws you in and immediately makes you forget you're watching a mere""movie"".  The Empire Strikes Back, more than any of the others, is responsible for bringing the whole drama of the saga into people's minds.",
802,11 September 2005,delanenoel,10, The Best of Them All !!!,"Without a doubt the empire strikes back is the best star wars film out of the lot, even the new ones which in my opinion devalue the saga. From beginning to end you watch Luke learn to use the force and become a jedi, you also see the return of a very significant character in obi-wan kenobi. To learn the truth of Luke's father and who he is, is the shock of the decade. From the swamps of the degobah system to the sky's of cloud city this film is an adventure of mass proportions with an ending to rival any film, old or new. Lukes quest to become a jedi takes a twist when he faces darth vader for the first time, when vader breaks him mentally and physically you cant see a way back for our hero. Smuggler han solo is frozen in carbonite and taken to jabas tower on tatooine where we await the next instalment. All in all this is one of the best films ever, what makes it good is the shock of some unwanted news. This film doesn't fail to deliver and is a work of magic.!!!!!!!!!!!!",

And I admit that it's better structured than my favorite film in this movie series, A New Hope.

It is so amazing that movies become such perfect masterpieces sometimes. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is jammed full of character growth, drama, evil. The best part is... this is a cliffhanger movie. What will they do? How will they escape? Will they survive? Perhaps it's a great film that can leave you wanting more. But while leaving you wanting answers, you will want to watch the movie over and over to re-experience the pure darkness and discoveries. So many backdrops in this film personify this movie. The Matte paintings and/or sets of Dagobah seem very dark and almost ominous. Just a hint of the sublime add a lot to what was not there before. if anything, the movie is unparalelled in it's mastery of what the cinema was originally intended to show.

But I do have to say that it is very difficult to make a sequel better than the original and Empire surely did that. In many ways it is the very example of what a sequel should be; something that carries the characters further and in a more serious direction without loosing the feel of the original.  That is, of course, the main problem with The Phantom Menace. It completely looses the mood of all of the previous films.  Empire is dark, rich, and a wonderful piece of work to watch.",
813,20 October 2018,JimmWard,7, Very good,"Very well done film with some great directing, likeable characters, and the most famous plot twist in cinema.

With ""Star Wars"" already engrained into popular culture shortly after its release (much like ""The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"" is today), fans were left to ponder what the sequel could offer. Three years after the release of the original, they found out.  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" delivers a strong emotional punch.  Unlike its predecessor however it is not an uplifting and feelgood film.  Far from it in fact. ""Empire"" is a dark, brooding and somewhat surreal film, bristling with conflict and drama.  As a result it stands head and shoulders above its prequels and sequel.",

The thing that follows almost every time is a sequel! And 80 percent of the time it sucks... 15 percent of the time it's alright... And 5 percent of the time it's awesome and arguably better than the original! For me, The Empire Strikes Back is one of those 5 percent! And for me it is slightly better than the original, and one of my all time favorite movies! Following the worldwide success of Star Wars, Lucas quickly published that he would be writing a sequel, using ideas he couldn't fit in the original movie. This time Irvin Kershner would be directing the Star Wars flick. It went on to gross about as much money as the original, and it preceded the expectations for a Star Wars sequel! ",

819,12 February 2012,KrazzyDJ,10, The perfect Star Wars movie. The perfect action adventure flick. The perfect film.,"It's now an accepted fact that the first Star Wars is regarded as one of the most, or amongst some communities, the most successful movie of all time both in terms of critical acclaim and box office gross. Attempting a sequel to a movie of such magnitude, while an exciting prospect from the movie goers' perspective, is a suicidal task for the crew behind the same. One can only imagine the immense pressure of expectations that the makers of this film would have gone through while making this movie and even more so when the movie eventually saw the light. However, this movie not only fulfills all such hopes that fans of the first movie would have from the sequel but takes the Star Wars franchise into an even better and exciting territory, and improving upon the minor flaws of the first, turns out to be an adventure that can be regarded as good as perfect in all aspects of film-making. Although I had gotten a slight hint of this from the forums and internet talk, I now realize why this is regarded as the best movie in the Star Wars universe.",
820,7 January 2003,bigtgm,7, honest account,It really does seem that over time some movies do tend to take on an aura that is not worthy of them. The fact that the Empire Strikes back has gained such a following is evidence to this. The film has holes in its story the size of its budget and many of the roles are painfully one dimensional. If this movie was released today it would receive the same rubbishing that the two newer installments received and it would be well deserved.,

827,21 January 2003,mt7176,10, This is not a film. This is a fantasy.,"In 1977 when Star Wars came out it was the biggest thing to happen to movies in a very long time.  Star Wars was a science fiction film that focused on escapism rather than scientific lore that usually weighs down other sci-fi films.  Instead of explaining everything through the actors dialogue Lucas just showed us with sophisticated direction, set designs, and special effects.  Still if it was not for Empires Strikes Back the Star Wars saga would not have achieved the level of pop culture status that it now enjoys, for if it was Star Wars that introduced us to the worlds and the main characters of the original trilogy it was Empire Strikes back that gave us the entire theme of Star Wars saga.  It clearly showed us the struggles of the good and power of the evil.  The empire is just not a government body to be despised but to be feared as well.  The Empire is a collected evil who iss everywhere.  The story also reveals much more in terms of who Luke actually is, of his gifts, and how he could be a candidate for either good or evil.  As well it hints at the connection between Luke and Leia and of course reveals the Luke and Vader connection.  ",

New characters were introduced as Han and Leia's love grew. It was especially hard to say goodbye. But then the ending Darth Vader being Luke's father was just an amazing plot twist!!

There is more suspense than in ""Star Wars"" (1977), there are deeper developed characters than in ""Star Wars"" and it is better written (Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett no less!) than ""Star Wars"". After all, and especially after that computer animated waste of anyone´s time called, among other things, ""The Phantom Menace"" (1999), the suspicion that George Lucas might have invented the Star-Wars-Universe but isn´t its major artistic force is rooted in evidence.",

These 3 Films have great Music, great characters, Great special effects that still hold up today, great story, great action and great world building. Now let's talk specific about this movie. The opening of this movie is spectacular. And in this movie we're introduced to Yoda who is one of the best movie characters of all time. We also have the greatest plot twist of all time. And this movie just does exactly what a sequel should do: Raising the stakes for our heroes and battle them to their lowest point.

I still imagine putting myself in the action at the Battle of Hoth and meeting the cool and lovable Yoda that many even non star wars fans have come to adore and just the intensity when Luke fought Darth Vader and found out he was his father changed the way I looked at films made me want more and I still find this better than the first and will ever praise this film.",

But the duel between Vader and Skywalker is one of the best sword fights EVER! If there is anyone out there who is reading this and hasn't seen this movie or Starwars, then see them all NOW.

It expanded the world of Star Wars giving us new planets and new ideas to explore and also made the characters more interesting by adding more layers to them and adding new characters who are also interesting. It also expanded the Star Wars universe more by making the villains more interesting and relatable as well. The action and music as well is step up from the first giving you so much more in this amazing universe. Overall it's not just a perfect sequel but a perfect film as well with nothing wrong about it's perfectly paced, perfectly acted, perfectly written, and just perfect that's really how I describe this movie and it's one of the best of all time. Overall grade= A+",
842,9 April 2005,ztruk2001,10, Perfect blend of sci-fi and fantasy. Light years above the other Star Wars pictures.,"How do you follow up the most successful science fiction/fantasy film of all time? Make a sequel that's bigger and better than the original. Not only is The Empire Strikes Back better than A New Hope, but it completely blows it out of the water. The first Star Wars film started it all and paved the way for the second installment, but essentially it was a fairly bland and simple space adventure with great special effects. Return of the Jedi, which followed The Empire Strikes Back, was also a weaker film. Empire is clearly the best film of the original trilogy. So much in fact it transcends the other films and it's easy to appreciate the film out of the context of the Star Wars universe. While the first film was too cartoonish and the third too unbalance, the second hit exactly the right note. The story picks up several years after A New Hope. The Death Star is destroyed and the rebels are hiding at their base on the ice planet of Hoth. The Empire is hot on their trail with a zealous Darth Vader combing the galaxy in search of them. From the very start of the movie it's one big giant chase. Unlike the other two films, Empire gets the big battle out of the way in the beginning so that it can slowly build down until the climax. It's a reversal of the typical adventure film arc and it works perfectly. In Empire all of the characters are fleshed out and become as real people, whereas in A New Hope they just served the storyline. There's the classic Greek mythology pathos going on with the battle between good and evil. There are also many shades of gray in the film, as the characters drift in out and of good and evil, and face difficult decisions. Out of the entire trilogy the middle film also features the most impressive and elaborate sets. Over the course of two hours we are taken into four different worlds, the ice planet Hoth, the swamp world of Dagobah, an asteroid field in space, and Cloud City. All four locales are entirely impressive. The lighting is another key factor in the film's vibrant look. Lighting becomes the most flamboyant towards the end of the film during the dusk looking scenes at Cloud City. Finally something must be said of the epic lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader that makes up the film's climax. It's the best duel in any of the films. Storywise there's a lot on the line, but it's choreographed and filmed so well it wouldn't matter how it ties into the story. It's the dirtiest and grungiest of all the duels. It's nice to actually see the physical effects of fighting for a change. In the other films the characters are pretty much stoic but here we get to see Luke grow out of breath, tire, bleed, and have his cloths torn. He stumbles around, expresses emotion, and even gets a few nice on-uppers on Vader when he's underestimated. Ultimately it's a wonderful way to finish a great film. Also I should mention the good performances from Billy Dee Williams, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford.",
843,16 November 2015,charleswjoke,8, A fantastic epic,"I am a Star Wars fan since I was a kid and it's very hard to watch this film critically after all these years. What I was wondering throughout this viewing is why does this movie work as well as it does. It really shouldn't... The dialogue and acting is average, the special effects aren't picture perfect, the plot is as old as plots come yet I felt compelled to watch and be entertained. I was enthralled with this movie once again. Perhaps, its the simple cinematography that doesn't really try to do anything special but just works, maybe its the simple hero story of growth and learning, maybe its the chance to live in this entertaining and strange world where meeting a green little creature can change the tide of the film. This movie instills a sense of hope to the viewer. We somehow know everything will be OK, the heroes will live another day, which is really strange as the plot of this Star Wars is all about the failures of the heroes, the failure of Luke, the failure of the rebels... but the movie leaves a slight glimmer of hope that makes all the difference. This film hearkens back to a simpler time, where films were simple and enjoyable and people liked that with a childish sense of naivety, but hey, we should all be children once in a while.",

I have yet to see attack of the Clones, but if TESB is any indication AotC will be the best of the prequel trilogy.  The Empire Strikes back provides much more action than the first, and provides some much more interesting landscapes than Tatooine did.  Bespin provides a nice look into the technology and spledor of the SW universe.  The introduction of Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian pays off big, as the audience is given a better development of Han Solo.  In addition, the character development continues, and gives more insight into the desperation of the Rebel Alliance.  The Battle of Hoth is very well done, and easily outdoes the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Endor.  If, for some reason you have been living on the moon for the past 22 years, SILENTLY get a copy and watch it, for the ending is one that no man should be told in advance.

It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action. It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development. The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film. The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series. This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional. This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish.",

857,15 October 1998,Pinkfish-2,10, Praise for The Empire Strikes Back,"The Empire Strikes back is the second film in the renowned Star Wars trilogy.  Being the second part in a three part saga, it was naturally the darkest of the films.  But, that does not make it any less a part of film history. It was one of the most successful sequels ever, continuing the story of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo.  It also included many key points in the story. In this film, Luke Skywalker truly begins his Jedi training, and cuts it short, something that will plague him for years to come.  Luke also confronts Darth Vader, and finds out that Vader is his father, the most dramatic moment in the film, and when he loses his hand. Princess Leia and Han Solo finally fall in love, only to be captured and separated when Han is frozen in carbonite. Leia is driven by her love for Han for the next year, unable to let him go.  Han is frozen, unable to move, in the clutches of Jabba the Hutt.  This is the beginning of a wonderful romance. This movie has done a superb job of continuing the Star Wars saga, and deserves every ounce of praise that has been thrown at it.  Then again, I'm probably a little partial.",

859,30 November 2001,palpatine89,10, Almost as good as the first.,"This one is exelent and almost as good as A New Hope.  The only thing that brought it down for me was the fact that it was so depresing. In this one the Rebles have been driven onto a remote planet called Hoth. The Impeials find the base and lay seige to it.  Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammiel) gose to Dagobah to complete his jedi training by master Yoda (Frank Oz), while Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mahew), and C3P-O (Anthony Daniels) flee to Cloud City which is owned by an old ""friend"" of Han's, Lando Calrision (Billy Dee Wiliams).  The climax much more intense than the last (so is the rest of the movie). Again exelent preformances by Mark Hammiel, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Billy Dee Williams, along whith the rest of the cast.  Again George Lucus is an exelent story-teller. This isn't as good as the last just because it's so dark.  I give Star Wars Episode 5 The Empire Striks Back 10/10",

Harrison Ford is perfect for the role of Han Solo and creates most of the character atmosphere.

Least appealing action, no great up-close one-on-one battle, and definitely does not meet the standard of Return of the Jedi. It was a necessary aspect of the trilogy and can't be left out because of many necessary plot lines, but similar to Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers, drawn out. I don't even believe it would rank second in the new episodes that have been released in the past ten years that are far more revolutionary.

887,28 November 2019,Cinemagoer77,10, Lucas is some kinda genius in the world,"In a new hope, the wizard behind the scenes capable of using special effects tricks on a lower budget to create a mythological world from his mind was a suspected genius. Well, Empire confirms that Lucas wasn't a one trick pony and confirms he is a genius in the cinematic world through vision and special effects. This time with Empire we get to see more of the rich galaxy from Lucas's mind and a better emotional tone than the first film which i felt was too lacking considering the genocidal actions of the imperial forces. While some people defend the lack of better emotional reactions in a new hope i argue that emotional reactions validate cinematic hardships. Well, In a new hope, Luke had begun to develop a bond (he wanted to be a Jedi like his father) or tie to his father who had fallen but he doesn't know the revelation ahead of him. Obi Wan the only person to truly help Luke understand who he is and where he comes from has died but his tie to Luke is still there helping him early before Han rescues him. We begin to see more of what the force is and Hans character development too in the rescue. The musical score also adds to the films tone which is something the first film didn't have enough of..i know for some the beautiful music as luke looks toward the sunset was enough in a new hope but since the emotion was off everywhere else i thought a musical score could have helped out or even a pensive stare later lol In empire strikes back we have the dreaded empire theme preceding Vaders 1st appearance in the film. Iconic music!. Before Luke uses the force in the beginning we hear soft music that precedes Lukes force use in a life or death situation.its actually emotional..we begin to see the force is about feeling. Later on Yoda hints to young Luke of the force, all of it and how scary it can get. Force users can succumb to darkness. Vader was once a decent person. Yoda tells luke you will..you will be.. (afraid)..Yoda warns naive Luke basically to help him on his journey because the road ahead is extremely arduous, physically and emotionally. Every force user faces fear..yoda trains luke as much as possible given the time..luke knows his friends are in danger yet despite all warning luke chooses his friends over yodas and obi wans warning. Luke is actually seen as reckless but imo he is facing fear and runs to it actually. I can go on and on how empire strikes back is a fantasy masterpiece in space..everything has been said about this film and why it is historic. There are cinematic moments the world will never see or hear again. Period. Yes the plot isn't perfect, but it is how the story was told..even better than the first film mind you fantasy films are difficult to pull off..The only fantasy world that i can think of off the top of my head with decent characters was the earlier seasons of game of thrones. Fantasy films are not easy to pull off given the 2 to 3 hours time given. Lucas created a masterpiece in over 2 hours.
With all being stated, Empire strikes back revealed that at his best George Lucas is a visionary genius and the world will likely never see such an original story told on the big screen like this one.",

This film is every bit the masterpiece it was when I was 14, & it still keeps me entranced at 44. It also bears some very unhappy truths as to where this franchise has gone over the years. This was the film out of the original trilogy that Lucas had very little to do with and it shows. It shines above all the rest as the fans favorite of all favorites. One of the main things that are forgotten about the original trilogy is that these films had very wonderful characters. Those cardboard creations of so called characters in the new films cannot stand up to the band of ragged rebels struggling against the oppressive Empire. The action is brilliant & helps the story instead of being pointless & an excuse for CGI overkill. I can only hope that once the Lucas legacy is passed on, new blood will continue on to breathe fresh air into this awesome vehicle of fantasy. That the directors of tomorrow won't be so self gratifying & think of the responsibility to fans foremost. Every time I see another Clone Wars rehash I wonder what happened to X-wings, Tiefighters, the Millennium Falcon. Han, Leia, Chewie & Luke. Where are MY characters?

903,12 January 1999,Gen S2rt,10," This film is no less spectacular than ""A New Hope""","Of all the movies that have had follow-ups to the original, many just had sequels made only because the first was successful enough for it.  First thing to know: ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is NOT a sequel.  A standard ""sequel"" is simply the same or similar characters from one movie put in the same or similar situation to the one of the original movie, which is complete without any sequel (Jurassic Park, Speed).  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was pre-planned, and while ""Star Wars"" did seem like a complete story by itself, that was a result of creator George Lucas' uncertainty of whether or not they'd be given the opportunity to complete his saga of stories. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" did an excellent job as the film following ""Star Wars: A New Hope"", because it strived toward the same excellence the first one achieved, while the mood of this chapter contrasted that of the first entirely.  The first one definitely had a lighter sort of mood to it, as far as the action among the rebels.  This film concentrates more on the war itself, and how tough it is on the rebellion.  It also has more establishment of the imperials and their ruthlessness, which definitely adds a darker tone to it.  Score composer John Williams helps give this feeling to the film, with the now famous Imperial March that is so closely associated with villain Darth Vader (James Earl Jones).  For a mood this dark, there sure is a lot of really nice scenery in the film, from the glaciers of the planet Hoth to the spanning cloudscape of Bespin.  The special effects remain as amazing as those in ""A New Hope"", and have been re-done with a ""Special Edition"" as well as the first one, although not as much has changed in this film.  The acting is also just as good as it was in the first one, with the addition of Yoda (Frank Oz) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams).  The emotion of this film definitely surpasses those in ""A New Hope"", with the characters' personalities and relationships explored more deeply, such as between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and even Luke (Mark Hamill) and Darth Vader, who for the first time have an actual face-to-face confrontation with each other in the unforgettable lightsaber duel.  This film is even more suspenseful and action-packed, with an incredible climax and other very high points as well. Of all the intense and breathtaking aspects of this film, the one that everyone has remembered since, and will be remembered for as long as ""Star Wars"" itself, is the revelation by Vader to Luke, which most people already know by now.  If you are one of the very few who don't, don't do anything until you see this film (and the first one, too) and find out from the movie, not from some loud-mouthed friend, the way many of us did.  As hard as it would be to make a film as great as ""A New Hope"" after it changed the standards of filmmaking forever, this film definitely meets and surpasses the first one.  It will also leave you hanging for the trilogy's final film, ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983), which also does not disappoint in any way.  A SECOND must-see for science fiction fans, or movie fans in general.",

In this, we get a startling revelation (well, at least in 1980 it would have been startling; that thing's been so spoofed, you'd have to live in a hole in the ground to miss it; but anyway, I digress), a question to tickle us for the next sequal, the best battle in all of the Star Wars movies, and a love story between Han and Leia.  This was more of an original story than the other sequals, since the story line revolved more around the individual characters than a great threat to the galaxy or a planet(Ep. 6:  A Death Star, how original; Ep. 1:  Naboo under attack).  The acting was good and the special effects were good even for an '80s movie (especially for an '80s movie).  Overall, best of the 5.",

After a really cool Snow Speeder vs. Imperial AT-AT and AT-STs, the movie takes an entirely different course from the first, and at the end, revealing a secretthat would rock Star Wars devotees worlds (as to what the secret is, we know it's that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father). This ""episode"", not written by Lucas, but by Leigh Brackett, is, what some may call, the one that broke the rule.  That rule being that ""Sequels are never as good as the original.""  I'll admit, I differ from them slightly.  Toward the end, I found myself anxious for it to end (probably because I had to use the restroom).  Upon further viewing (and time alotted for restroom breaks), I found it much more enjoyable. The enstallment offers a lot more than the forementioned surprise, but it introduces several characters, a small, swamp dwelling Jedi Master named Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz), the sleazy ruler of the cloud city of Bespin, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), and a faceless bounty hunter, hired by Jabba the Hutt to capture Han Solo, named Bobba Fett.

In this episode, the relationship between Han Solo, the coolest freighter pilot ever, and Princess Leia is beginning to evolve into a love story, Darth Vader's master is at long last revealed, Yoda, the wise Jedi master is sought out by Luke Skywalker at the instruction of Obi-Wan, and Darth Vader makes an announcement that will forever change young Luke's life.  The lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke is one of my personal favorite action sequences in the Star Wars universe.

913,15 May 2002,Sean_Thorniley,9, An even more fluid and fun ride than the first one.,"Tomorrow night at Midnight I will see the next chapter in the saga that is Star Wars.  Tonight I watched them all again to refresh my memory of what it is all about to give a better viewing of Episode II: Attack of the Clones tomorrow night at 12 am. 	I initially saw Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on its opening weekend in a small theater in Crescent City, CA as a touch more than a neophyte movie aficionado.  Hitchcock flicks were my favorite at that time.  Hitch is still one of my favorite past filmmaker with Hawks and Capra close seconds. These days my tastes lean to Scorsese, Aronofsky and the Coen Brothers. Coppola, Speilburg and Lucas are very good, but to me are more great craftsman than great artists.  All have had artistic successes (The Godfather, Schindler's List and THX 1138), but I think they are better craftsman than artists over all. 	Lucas is by far one of the greatest producers and craftsman of all time and has done more for true independent film than possibly any director/producer since Chaplin.  I also feel strongly that Empire is a far better film than Star Wars with tighter pacing, dialog and performances all around.  The was a fluidity that the first one lacked and feel that was built in was not only what was ""tight about it"". 	The ""weaknesses"" of Star Wars as a piece of ""art"", or even craft is dwarfed by its emotional impact and timing of release.  I was ten when I saw it the first time (several weeks after it was released) and I had to share a seat in the front row with my younger brother who didn't like me much at the time.  Once the music started and the words rolled up the screen we didn't care and loved every single second!  All we told our dad when he met us out front afterwards was ""can we see  it again dad, can we see it again dad..."". I saw it eleven time in the theater that summer including three time in a row on a great day.  This is amazing since my town had only one theatre/screen and it was exceptional that it stayed around long enough for me see it as often as I  did.   The Trilogy was the first VHS I ever owned (my mother paid $70 each in 85). 	My point is that emotional attachment, or detachment to a film is equally important to what a person may think of it critically as a piece of art, or entertainment.  I have loved all the Star Wars films and have seen them all except for the first one on its opening day and even the first show of that day with the last two!  All that said however, I wouldn't call any of them ""great films"".  Important and amazing films, ""Hell Ya!"".  Some of the best rides I have ever had, ""Hell Ya!"".  Worth watching all in a row every now and again, you bet. 	Episode V is more of a love story and character developing episode IV which is why it tends to be many folks favorite thus far.  Knowing it will be a blast and finding out that Vader is really Luke's dads only bolsters it.  I think Jedi is the best still and part of that may be the fact that I knew that Blue Harvest was really Star Wars III (episode VI) when they shot all the wonderful ""forest"" scenes.  I didn't watch them do it, but knowing it was happening and that the speeder chases were truly impossible (since I lived and played Star Wars in those woods), yet there they were right in front of my eyes. This may be why it still has the strongest hold on my heart!  I don't think that the story of Jedi significantly better than Empire, but I am more into temptation, redemption and what is and is not destiny which is more deeply explored and acted out in Jedi. 	Love one, love them all it is tough to chose.",

Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Chewbacca are all back in this installment and in top form. Lando Calrissian and Yoda make for some welcome additions to the series. The plot keeps the audience of edge the whole time as the Rebel Alliance is dealt a devastating blow by a vicious attack by the Galactic Empire. While Luke Skywalker furthers his quest to become a full fledged Jedi, his friends Han and Leia are desperately trying to out-maneuver the scheming Darth Vader who holds a dark secret in Luke's past.

Empire is a lot darker than its predecessor and this helps to heighten the drama and make the story more compelling as now we truly see the threat the empire can impose. It becomes more though provoking as a philosophical side to the force is introduced. New, equally iconic and beloved characters are introduced, characters like Yoda, Lando and Boba Fett. This is also the film that truly defined Darth Vader as one of the greatest villains of all time as not only is he made more intimidating but also more complex thanks largely to the infamous twist. Yet the film still manages to be just as fun as the original as we have great space battles and the greatest lightsaber duel of the entire saga. Yet what makes these action scenes so cowling and exciting is our emotional investment we have with the story and characters, you will laugh, cry, feel tense and cheer, once the end credits roll you'll be emotionally drained.",

Luckily, the decision was made and Kershner turned in what is, by a long stretch, the best of the series. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a breathless chase movie but, unusually for this series, plot is allowed to intrude on action and the actors seem to have suddenly found some character. The whole thing is infused with a wonderfully dark operatic quality, greatly assisted by the rich and imaginative visuals. Movies like this need a good hissable villain and Dave Prowse and James Earl Jones as (respectively) the body and voice of Darth Vader turn him into a truly frightening nemesis (rather than the cardboard cut-out he is in the other films), all of which serves to give the whole enterprise a weighty centre that was completely absent from its predecessor.",

The characters are great, and it just feels a good aftertaste. Great twists. Unlike in the new movies (I don't mean the prequels, but the new movie trilogy) where character arcs just jump ahead whenever it's required by the story, in this movie, you see the characters progress and become different.

Think about the limited resources they had at the time. Well you need not. It can be compared to any contemporary film sci-fi or otherwise. True, people who cannot watch sci-fi movies won't appreciate star wars to its true value. But then, can they appreciate cinema as a whole? Casting this unsolicited attack aside, those who are not experts in the field and I would include myself as one, should start with star wars series. Star Wars IV a new hope was a very good start but the special effects and plot was not as refined. You could see the lack means as a first major project for George Lucas. But it is easily forgiven since Star wars V is the gem in the crown. I have to rate this film as a masterpiece, if not by its incredibly credible special effects (even by 2009 standards), but by a story which keeps the mystery till the end. The epic fighting and tight situations keep us on the edge of our seats throughout. It is fast paced. But I watch this film at least once every year. And every time I know I am going to watch it again. I know the story, I surely remember almost all the scenes of the movie. It is the atmosphere in which we are cast from the minute the small written resume rolls up the screen with the background music, that doesn't leave us. George Lucas, as confirmed Steven Spielberg is a master at story telling. He adds the spices to an already good sauce to make it sublime. Hans Solo is in the same vein as Indy in Indiana Jones, but we just never get tired of it. The two droids add an uncanny sense of humour; the unity of the whole rebel group; the love hate relationship of Hans Solo and Leia, all very simple ingredients mixed together by the genius of George Lucas, whether he did it purposely or not. We are projected in a well oiled machine working at optimal capacity, and all we can do is follow, no questions asked. It goes without saying that I recommend buying the collection.",
957,8 May 2003,purpobandit,10, Best of the Star Wars epics,"The best of the Star Wars epics! When I was younger I use to like Jedi the best because it concluded the trilogy, but looking back this is the best of all 5 in the series. Great new characters introduced, secrets revealed, a darker tone, and great direction by Irvin Kirshner.",
958,11 January 2006,Evil_Chihuahua,9, Better than the original,"As we already know, sequels are rubbish. They are nothing more than someone taking the characters from the original and putting them into a new setting that no one really cares about (see Men in Black 2, Neverending Story 2, etc). But every so often a sequel comes along that is just as good, if not better than the original, such as Aliens, Termenator 2, X-men 2 and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. But the Empire Strikes Back is the GREASTEST sequel in film history.",

960,23 May 1999,zorchmag,9, Best of the Star Wars line.,"Better than Star Wars. Better than Return of the Jedi. And do you know why? Because it spends more time on character development and dramatic buildup than either of its siblings. While The Empire Strikes Back does include its share of space battles and lightsaber duels, the big focus isn't on special effects, but on relationships between characters. The heroes and villains are both developed in interesting ways, plus there's that surprise twist which you probably already know about, but which I won't risk spoiling for you.",
961,13 October 1999,KJMill25,10, The Best of Them All,"Well I watched the whole trilogy over the weekend just to get a better feel for things.  I must say that this was the best of the three.  Lucas touched on every subject and more within the Star Wars universe.  This story actually leads directly into The Return of the Jedi.  Unlike Star Wars which basically could have stood alone and gotten its point across.  The movie needs Jedi as a follow up or it just doesn't work.  But that doesn't diminish from the quality of the movie.  And I must also say that even though I was watching the Special Edition.  The ORIGINAL effects were superb.   So to sum up, if you want to see the best out of the four Star Wars movies, please watch this one.  It's definately(sp?) worth it.",
962,21 January 2001,theshuttlewoods,9, Best Star Wars film made,"Although it is argued that 'A New Hope' was more original and revolutionary (Which it is), I believe that 'Empire' is a better film. While the first film touches on Luke's destiny, in 'Empire' Luke begins to see the potential of his power, and also sees the temptation of the dark side. Where this film succeeds where the others fail is in the psychology of the film. Luke realises that his own worst enemy is himself, not Vader. Vader too is given far more scope in this film. We see his full range of his powers, his relationships with Imperial Officers, and more importantly with the Emperor. The climax of the film (Which I won't give away, just in case you've been living under a rock since 1980), ties up a lot of loose ends and intertwining stories from the film. Ultimately it sets up a great start for the final part of the trilogy (Unfortunatley it wasn't lived up to). A very solid 9/10",
963,29 May 2002,Zebula77,10, The Best Film I Have Ever Seen!,"What can I say about a film I've seen more than 30 times? This is my favourite of all Star Wars films and as I'm a huge SW fan, it is also my favourite film of all time. It has my favourite soundtrack of any film. I especially like 'The Empirial March' and the Han and Leia Love them which ends the film so beautifully, it brings tears to my eyes.",
