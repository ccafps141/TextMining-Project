0,29 September 2008,ccthemovieman-1,10," Just As Intriguing The Second Time, Too!","I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.",/
1,30 May 2018,NpMoviez,10, Fantastic.,"I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other ""popular"" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with ""Memento"" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of ""Memento"" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full ""interchange"" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more ""wrong"" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most ""complex"" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of ""Prisoners"" (2013) and ""Logan"" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special ""10/10"" and an ""A+"".",r
2,7 September 2009,murtaza_mma,10, Are you watching closely?,"The Prestige, adapted from an award winning novel of the same name by Christopher Priest, is an intricate tale of passion, intrigue, deceit and obsession about two illusionists, whose morbid covetousness for absolute supremacy in their profession engenders a fierce rivalry that turns internecine and ultimately consumes them. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) at the start of their careers are highly ambitious young men assisting an elderly illusionist named Milton. Borden's incessant longing for innovation leads to the accidental death of Angier's wife. Borden marries Sarah and his apparent happiness further aggravates the sense of revulsion in Angier's heart. Angier's vindictive intervention during a bullet catch trick causes Borden to lose his two fingers. Though these events sowed the seeds of implacable hatred, but it is the unremitting yearning of their perpetually insatiable egos to outperform each other that eventually drives them to perdition.",e
3,20 October 2006,DICK STEEL,10, A Nutshell Review: The Prestige,"I've said it before, but I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan can do no  wrong.  Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and  Michael Caine, and joined with the Scoop team consisting of X-Men's  Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson, the stellar (eye candy)  cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they'll be able to live  up to the hype of Nolan's long awaited movie directly challenging the  other picture about Victorian magicians, The Illusionist.  The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick, with the first and  second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to  its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out, it's like a huge  magic trick, with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds, getting  the suspicion on how it's done, but yet sitting through it thorough  engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It  tells the story of how two magicians, fellow apprentices turned  unfortunate rivals, plod down the slow path of jealous obsession,  revenge, and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each  other's ideas, to go one up against the other, a fight in romance, life  and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are  perfect explanations of the value of secrets, and how secrets can  sometimes be used as tools for deceit.  What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the  notion of how ""magic"" actually worked. Besides the better understanding  of the common body of scientific knowledge, things like having pretty  assistants to distract, and having planted staff amongst the audience,  somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions, and try harder to  spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More  importantly, it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal  engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely  for the magician's use, and how having disloyal staff can indeed be  detrimental to any leaks of secrets.  And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter, responsible  for assisting Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) with loyalty and conviction  that they could, as a team, beat Christian Bale's Alfred Borden. I  thought the cast in general were superb, with Christian Bale leading  the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark  character, as the two leads tackled their characters' theme of  sacrifice, arrogance, and ultimately redemption, especially for Rupert  Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of  penance to what happened in the beginning, hoping to kill two birds  with a single stone, to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly  muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that  there is no right or wrong, no hero or villain. It's always a shade of  grey in what they do, and for Alfred Borden, I felt it's more for  survival and the provision for family, which is a strong subplot  running through the film. I just have to mention though, that Scarlett  Johansson being Esquire's Sexiest Woman Alive, gets to play a flower  vase role here as a magician's assistant, though her role as the pawn  between the rivals added a little gravitas.  The atmosphere was set up great, and so were the costumes and sets. The  soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing, capturing the look and mood  appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie's appearance as a Serbian  scientist!   I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the  non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to  use placeholders, or flashback sequences, colours etc, here, time is so  fluid, but yet the audience will know precisely which era they're in,  without being explicitly told, or working too much of the noodle. You  just know, and it's just that feeling of being totally transparent with  time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours,  you don't feel its length at all.  At the end of the movie, one quote popped into mind: Misdirection -  what the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Quite apt to  describe how things work out during the movie, or to describe in  general, Nolan 's films so far. That added richness to lift the movie  to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour, if there's one movie you  absolutely must watch this week, then Prestige must be your natural  choice. It's smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none  other.  P.S. Is it just me, or are notebooks a common feature in Nolan's  movies?",v
4,16 October 2006,iohefy-2,9, Outstanding acting performances worth price of admission,"I went to see a critics preview of The Prestige this afternoon and to  my surprise I found the film to be one of the best I have seen all year  so far, and that writers can come up with an excellent script it they  would only try a little harder. The acting performances by Hugh  Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in  a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a  little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film  and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the  way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for  some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as  soon as you can, you will not be disappointed.",i
5,28 October 2006,gavin6942,10, Give This Film Time to Sink In...,"Leaving the theater, I thought the film was just okay. An hour later, I thought it was pretty clever. And now, the next day, I think it was amazing. Why the change? It took that long for most or all of the subtle hints to sink in and the real twists to be discovered. The film doesn't end when you leave, it begins.",e
6,26 May 2015,Horst_In_Translation,8, So glad this movie did not stay an illusion...,"In the filmmakers' minds. Instead, it became one of the finest films of the year 2006. ""The Prestige"" is a perfect example of what a movie should be like if it does not rely on you liking and cheering for the central characters. Neither Angier (Jackman), nor Borden (Bale) are likable characters at all. And yet you are completely under their spell as this film goes on. This may be a bit of a subjective take as I quite like Hugh Jackman and find Bale a joy to watch most of the time as well. And Johansson and Hall are among my favorite actresses as well. But it's not only the cast that makes it so much worth watching. It's also the visual side. Art direction, set decoration, cinematography and costumes are top-notch and even the rare special effects are pretty nice. The film managed two Academy Award nominations for its visual side, both of them very deserved and I actually would not have minded if it had won one of these over ""Pan's Labyrinth"".",w
7,23 October 2006,Hitchcoc,10, A Film with Intellect,"I thought this was an amazing film. It takes a period before the advent of the illusionist pyrotechnics of modern times and shows us the magic. Not only does it have the magic working for it, it has a great story of revenge, hatred, one-upsmanship, genius, you name it. The story teaches us about illusion which is a much more accurate term for what we see. I will never look at David Copperfield the same way again. There is incredible scenic effluence. The acting is impeccable and the direction and cinematography is unrivaled. For once a film that lives up to its hype. Using David Bowie as Tesla is marvelous. I've always thought that he should have had a much greater career as an actor than he has realized. Michael Caine is the voice of reason, but his voice is seldom listened to. Revenge is one of the oldest motives and it poisons one of the characters. Stay with this one; then see it again. It is a masterpiece.",/

Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson play other love interests.",r
9,27 December 2006,Flagrant-Baronessa,9, Webby meshwork of magic and mystery,"Director Christopher Nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives (Memento) and in The Prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale, puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices. With his remarkably sleight-of-hand direction, he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in Victorian-era London, creating a cerebrally stimulating 2 hour long mise-en-scene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behind-the-stage intrigue.",w
10,21 October 2006,Surecure,8, Storytelling at its best!,"The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast.

17,13 July 2019,orko_dutta,8, Fantastic!,The final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances. I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the non linear narrative so flawlessly. What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist - very unique.,/
18,25 June 2019,FeastMode,10, my notes,Omg. possibly the greatest film ever made. the most genius story ever put to film. I keep saying it's hard for me to believe that it's even possible to come up with such a smart story. Amazing acting throughout. Intense throughout.

20,27 November 2011,classicsoncall,8," ""It is very rare to see... real magic.""","Oh man, this one had me right up to the part with the transporter/duplicator machine. Until then it was a compelling and complex tale dealing in murder, mystery and intrigue with a clever backdrop of magicians attempting to outdo each other with the grandest illusion of all time. What I'm not going to do is go back and watch this three times in a row like I did with ""Memento"" because when all is said and done, I won't be any better off. In a way I felt cheated that an 1880's era film would bring in a fictional sci-fi element the way it did. It seems to me the story could have gotten around that contrivance to come up with a more realistic resolution that confined itself to existing science and techniques of illusion. Then, when Borden (Christian Bale) had his final showdown with Angier (Hugh Jackman), he could have caught the bullet to end the picture on a more promising note. I don't really mean to sound so harsh on the film because like I said, up to the Tesla part this story was going great guns. Maybe because the guy portraying Tesla looked so much like David Bowie, it kept me off stride for a while as well. Then it turned out to be Bowie when the credits rolled, and I was back to thinking about that business with the cats and the hats. Maybe the whole thing was an illusion.",e

The great production design, the fabulous acting, the great cinematography, the superb writing, the awesome directing ... I really don't know. But I do know, that this is another Nolan movie.

26,29 February 2012,ceeingred13,10, Remarkable. Nolan's best,"This movie was truly a game-changer for me. I initially saw it simply because I enjoyed some members of the cast so much (Bale, Caine, Bowie), but I left the theatre in awe. It is such a well-written, layered, intense, character driven story on par with Faustus or Jekyll and Hyde in terms of characters that are overly driven by their obsessions. It invites you to watch in the first lines of dialogue and from that point forward, you hardly have a choice. One of Nolan's strengths is that he doesn't shy away from difficult stories to tell. None of the characters are entirely likable. It's hard to pick someone to root for, but that is one of the things that makes them so human. Jackman and Bale are both fine actors that attack their roles with tremendous capability and Rebecca Hall is one of the best discoveries I've had in movies. Even Johansson, who is easily the weakest link, was used sparingly and didn't detract from the movie. The plot is fascinating and leads to an immensely satisfying ending. I can't watch this enough times.",_

While on one hand it just seems to be a film about a couple of stage magicians who are bitter rivals, there is actually much more going on, and of course the time line doesn't move in a linear way either, which is something that Nolan definitely seems to like doing in this films.",u

This was a great movie when it came out 15 years ago, is a great movie now, and will be a great movie 30 years from now too. My only knock is that it requires some intentional ""suspension of disbelief"" in a few spots in order to make it work, but otherwise it's perfect. It is so good that it merits multiple viewings and I still look forward to watching it again. I put it in league with ""The Sixth Sense"" where the first time you watch it is superb but you have to watch it at least twice in order to really appreciate how good it is.",v

Yes, it is an adaptation, from a book, but many viewers will probably not know that until they actually begin to watch the movie, like this reviewer.

I went to see it, as a result, with mixed expectations. On one hand, I think Christian Bale is the next great method actor and I firmly believe Christopher Nolan is on the pathway to really carving out a name for himself in Hollywood (beyond the fanboy audiences). He's still being advertised as ""The Director of Memento and Batman Begins"" but soon it will just be ""From Director Christopher Nolan."" ",

Most movies have me leave the theater feeling like I wasted 8 dollars or so. So many movies lately have left me feeling like I wasted away precious hors of my life that could have been spent doing better things. Yet this movie was truly a masterpiece and kept me guessing the whole time. The acting was superb and so was the plot. I usually can predict the outcomes of movies pretty early on. And usually I can see the twist the writer planned. With this movie I was still left wondering into the last 5 minutes of the movie. I can't wait to own this on DVD.,
37,23 June 2009,sddavis63,5, It Had Its Moments,"I found the most interesting part of this movie to be the behind the scenes look at some of the tricks used by illusionists and magicians. The broader story has great potential. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play rival illusionists in late 19th century London, whose rivalry goes beyond just a fun competition and becomes dangerously obsessive with ultimately tragic results. All that sounds pretty good, and both Jackman and Bale were solid in their roles as Angier and Borden respectively, as was Michael Caine as Cutter, Angeirs' assistant. Spoiling the story somewhat for me was a sort of mini-subplot about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. Edison is never depicted in the movie, while Tesla is played by David Bowie of all people. That rivalry was very real of course but dissolves into a bit of a farce here, as Tesla has supposedly invented some sort of teleportation device that Angier wants to use in his show. A simple and obsessive rivalry would have been quite sufficient without that dive into sci-fi silliness. I also have to say that while the movie certainly had its strong points, for the most part the story just didn't take hold of me. I found it a little long and slow-paced at times, and in the last 15-20 minutes there just seemed to be too many twists and turns happening, which again took away from the story's credibility. In the end, my reaction was that this was OK, but nothing more. 5/10",

Over the years I have learned so much about the movie making process -- about how stunts and special effects are done -- that movies just don't amaze me quite as much any more.

Well, this is my second film of the same genre and they were both released in the same year, with my favourite actors - Hugh Jackman & Edward Norton.

46,18 May 2016,Horror-yo,6, Over-complicated mess of a Nolan,"Christopher Nolan, the co-writer/director, loves to over-complicate his films a lot, especially in his twists in the endings, and counts on the simplicity of the masses to get confused and be called a genius despite failing to deliver in his films' ultimate goals: the twists at the end, because most of his films rely on those heavily to be given any meaning or quality at all. In this fairly long-running drama, Bale (as usual) and Jackman produce high quality performances, and special credit given to Bale's wife in the film and David Bowie (who can really act !); in an otherwise strong cinematography flick. The main issue is that the film builds up a great momentum, with lots of twists and turns, but as we're held in suspense for the grande finale at the end, lots of if not everything that's been mounted before seems to crumble as we discover the truth unfolded in the dying, yes *dying*, moments of this disappointment.

48,16 May 2009,tburke85,9, The Prestige An Entertaining Thriller,"The Prestige is an entertaining thriller from writer/director Christpher Nothan the man behind films like Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. The Prestige is about two magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden whose friendship turns into an intense rivalry that leads them on a life long battle for supremacy. Hugh Jackman stars as Angier and Christian Bale plays Borden who also worked with Nolan on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Jackman and Bale are great in their roles portraying men who are driven to be the greatest magician in the world. Michael Caine is fantastic as always playing Cutter a man who builds and constructs illusion tricks. Scarlet Johannssan is strikingly beautiful as both Angier's and Borden's lover assistant Olivia. She brings a lot to the small role she does have in the film. David Bowie also does a solid job with his role as brilliant scientist Nikola Tesla. The rest of the cast including Piper Perabo as Angier's wife Julia, Rebecca Hall as Bordens wife Sarah, and Andy Serkis as Telsa's friend Allie are believable in their supporting roles. Director Christopher Nolan does a great job with the period setting and the mood of the film. Even with a running time of 130 minutes the film is never slow which helps draw the audience into the story. The plot for the most part is complex but never complicated but does require a couple of viewings to full understand what the movie was all about. From the twists and turns to the superb acting The Prestige is an entertaining thriller that is sure to please anyone looking for a good film to watch.",

The brilliance of this film comes from many different areas - the acting performances and the professionalism of the film shown throughout go a long way towards ensuring that The Prestige is an excellent film, but really it is the story that makes this one stand out. The film is based on a novel by Christopher Priest and focuses on magicians in nineteenth century London. Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are magicians and friends working as assistants to another successful magician. Their friendship turns sour, however, when Alfred makes a mistake that leads to the death of Robert's girlfriend on stage. This leads to a fierce rivalry between the two magicians, and after each one sabotages the others' magic show; the rivalry takes a new turn as they battle to see who can carry out the greatest magic trick...",

""The Prestige"" takes place in the Victorian era, where two rival magicians battle it out for each other's magic secrets, to create a more better magic trick, which will soon lead to serious consequences. The movie leads into unexpected moments, serious flashbacks, and edge-on-your-seat thrills. This film really tricked up my mind really well. There were many scenes in the movie that lead to twists and turns later on. Christopher Nolan is the only person that has a mind to trick the audience, and has a power to make a difficult puzzle of a movie that entertains audiences, and make them watch it over and over to understand the concept. The effects are glorious, the performances were superb, the music is dark, the film editing is super, the art direction is superb and the cinematography is golden. With a brilliant cast portrayed by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Michael Caine, & David Bowie, a mind-bending script by the Nolan Brothers, and a powerful plot containing twists and turns, ""The Prestige"" is a marvelous Nolan masterpiece, and it never disappoints!

Co-writer/director Christopher Nolan is very much in his territory here with this picture, and the sort of jigsaw-figure-out effect he had on his breakthrough Memento is redeployed here in a style that is never too deterring. He focuses so well on the two main characters, and the people focused around them, that there's no need to really feel as if one is being pulled away from the real emotional drive of each character. It's basically one big game that becomes something very dangerous once obsession becomes part of it (as Michael Caine's character notes is what children do). But all the while I went along totally well with what the story went through, in all its twists and pulling seemingly simple little turns out of a hat, because Nolan made the storytelling seamless and has actors that are utterly dependable and pitch-perfect in their roles.",

The Prestige refers to the Third Act of a magic trick. In Act One: The Pledge shows the ordinary. In Act Two: The Turn, the ordinary becomes extraordinary. In Act Three: The Prestige, the twist occurs and we see something shocking. Writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's ""The Prestige"", based on Christopher Priest's novel, embodies these three acts. The third act of ""The Prestige"" is a shocking surprise. While watching ""The Prestige"" I guessed half of the twist, but not everything, and was completely mesmerized by the end.

It's not so much a case of ""how did they do that, it's impossible"" as ""that IS impossible"". There's no magic trick at all, the whole conceit relies on a sci-fi teleporter/cloning machine which does not and never has existed. Well acted, well staged and filmed but the whole idea of the magic trick ending with a ""prestige"" is lost because, in this film, the trick has no prestige, just a sparkly device which, you feel, has been invented by the film-makers because they couldn't think up a clever ending. Twists and tricks are great in movies, provided they are believable and inventive. Doing the impossible is merely treating the audience as idiots.",

The story is okay, but what really took my breath away was the atmosphere (much like in Memento). He creates the perfect atmosphere for his movies, his style is brilliant. The shots are just gorgeous.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play rival magicians with a life long rivalry bent on figuring out the other. Controversy rises when a female apprentice drowns in a tank in a trick that backfired. Christopher Nolan previously made the best of the Batman series in Batman Begins as well as directing the clever thriller Memento. Here he examines the explanations and challenges of magic with tremendous sets and acts to overwhelm the mind. Jackman is excellent as an accomplished magician out to perfect the transporting act. Bale as the rival is married and has a daughter but spends much time in prison for murder. Scarlett Johansson plays an apprentice of Jackman's sent to achieve Bale's secrets. Finally there is Michael Caine who voices reason and the mystery behind it all. Rebecca Hall plays Bale's wife while Piper Perabo plays the wife of the Jackman character. Nolan is among the most intelligent of directors and seems confident in creating suspense as well as leave audiences guessing but the ending here may be questionable to some if not brilliantly vengeful. It doesn't believe magic so much as believe its illusion and utter disappointment. Score: 9 / 10",

He has the ability to create mood and deep, well rounded characters better than almost anyone in the thriller genre, ever. For my money, only Hitchcock was better. And the Prestige was something worthy of the Master himself. Its is a dark, twisty, surreal film that truly goes unexpected places. Nothing is what it seems. And Nolan manages to pull of the twists, turns and surprises expertly, never once make a jump in logic that you don't take with him without question. The acting is phenomenal, Bale, Jackman and Caine are all excellent. But it is Jackman who owns this film. Between this and The Fountain (which I still don't know if I liked or not) he has really come into his own as an actor. Its a shame he was completely ignored at awards time this year. Towards the end of the year, there were some truly great films, but this is unquestionably the best. Its a well paced, thoughtful, intricate thriller that is better written than almost anything I have seen in years. Nolan is one of the most talented directors of his generation, something he continues to prove film after film. Howmany of todays ""franchise"" directors take a break in the middle of a superhero franchise to make a moody, dark period thriller about dueling magicians?

The cutting back and forth, at first, is a little hard to follow but then suddenly it becomes much easier and clearer as the movie slows down. The critics who thought that it was too slow in parts were wrong. It has to slow down in order to let the audience catch up. this movie allowed itself to be suspenseful, sad, funny and thought provoking all at the same time.

85,24 February 2011,jboothmillard,8, The Prestige,"From director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight, Inception), released near about the same time as The Illusionist starring Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, both films have strong similarities, I was interested to see which of the two I'd find better. Basically, in 19th Century London, famous magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is on trial for the suspected murder of rival magician Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), and through flashback we see how their story played out all the way to the trial. So Alfred and Robert were originally good friends working as magician assistants for performer Milton (Ricky Jay), and their engineer for all the tricks and illusions on stage was Cutter (Sir Michael Caine). Their friendship turns into strong rivalry between each other when Robert's wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo) is put in the glass box of water to perform the famous escape trick, but Alfred supposedly tied a different knot for her to untie, therefore Robert blames him for her death from drowning. Separately they both become magician performers with their own stage show acts, Borden calls himself The Professor, while Angier becomes The Great Danton, and trying to ruin each other's performance, and maybe get new ideas for astonishing acts, they both disguise themselves once or twice to do just this. Robert has a new wife Sarah (Rebecca Hall) who gives him a daughter, and he has Cutter and his new assistant Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson), but he is looking for a new and revolutionary illusion. In disguise he attends the performance of his Rival, and he astonishes the audience with his new act, The Transported Man, and he wants to try and recreate the act, i.e. steal it, for himself, so Cutter finds him a very convincing lookalike to achieve this. But Robert wants to find out the real way to do the trick, or better create his own extraordinary alternative to it, and he finds that with some new technological marvel for real transportation, almost like teleportation. When he has perfected the act, and he knows Albert will be disguised in the audience and watching, that is when he lures him backstage to witness him fall through the trap door for the trick, and drown in the below water tank. That is how Albert is caught and imprisoned for the ""murder"", however he is shocked when he finds out that Robert is still alive, in disguise, and that he framed him. The film mentions the three important magic trick components: 1) the setup - show the something ordinary, 2) the performance, make something change, and 3) the prestige, bring the something back. The final shock of the film is not Robert being alive, but being killed by Albert, and the revelation that he has an identical twin brother, and that the real man is not the one in prison, oh, and that's how The Transported Man worked. Also starring Samantha Mahurin as Jess Borden, David Bowie as Tesla, Andy Serkis as Alley, Daniel Davis as Judge and Roger Rees as Owens. Jackman and Bale are equally matched as the mentally duelling magicians, Caine is really good as the man in amongst it all, Johansson gets her moments too, and the direction by Nolan is perfectly timed. The special effects for the magic is really good, the tricks themselves look as though they could be done for real, and the story is engaging, as for whether this is better than The Illusionist, it is, a terrific period mystery thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography. Very good!",

Well, I was pretty much floored because it's one of the most enjoyable and intriguing films I've seen in the last few years. With the exception of Johansson who doesn't seem to know what to do with her role, every performance was memorable. Bale finally convinced me that he's a leading man, Jackman was for once as good as his talent would make you think he should be, and it was especially refreshing to see Bowie and Michael Caine in a movie that's actually good for a change. The direction is very stylish but at the same time always appropriate. The twin diary narrative really serves the film well. I always love that moment when the story catches up to the narrator and you never really know if the narrator has all the clues up to that point.

Already, we are arguing with the person who was sitting beside us: how was it all accomplished?

This is only his fourth major film (following the neoclassic ""Memento,"" the haunting ""Insomnia,"" and the refreshingly dark ""Batman Begins""), but Christopher Nolan has developed clear visual stamps (i.e. panning crane shots of cold, snow covered locales and close-ups of the protagonist working with his hands), complex thematic elements (getting revenge through acts of showmanship or becoming someone/something else, protagonists riddled with guilt over horrible things beyond their control), and delicate and intricate handling of plot/scripting (folding in on time, multiple points of view, and disjointed chronology) that make him one of the most compelling up-and-coming auteurs working in film today.",

Yes, it is well done by in the end I don't care about any of its main characters because more than anything, their story reminds of Atreus and Thyestes, two brothers from the Greek Mythology where each would go very far to hurt and to humiliate the sibling.

The Nolans strike again with their very favorite subject; obsession. I won't make a crack about how they can't let that go. This and its ad campaign asks you to ""watch closely"", and frankly, it's because of me doing that that I figured out nearly every major twist. I'm not bragging; I honestly wish that there had been more surprises left. No, I'm warning you to not try to figure the secrets of this out before they are revealed to you, or at least not too hard. I also do agree with Ebert's complaint that they cheated in this. With that said, this is engaging, interesting and compelling from start to finish. The plot is marvelous, and this is well-paced. This is psychologically deep and accurate. The acting is amazing. This has a non-linear time-line, and utilizes it well. The story is fairly complicated, and you do need to pay attention. Script and dialog are well-written. This has fun moments, and the tone isn't all dark. Johansson looks incredibly hot as usual, and this does have some(albeit well-integrated and natural-seeming) eye-candy for males. There is a bit of bloody violence, a little mild to moderate language and plenty of disturbing content in this.

In essence, this makes him a bit like the drunk uncle who occasionally has something of import or interest to say. In any case, The Prestige, an intriguing concept that escaped my notice during its theatrical run, is one of the more interesting pieces to come out of the major studios during 2006. Naturally, the title makes no sense to anyone who is unfamiliar with the profession of the central characters, but a masterfully-delivered monologue by Michael Caine explains it all in a manner that leaves one unable to help thinking that it all works beautifully.

Using rather obvious ploys (like phony beards and wigs, not to mention Scarlett Johansson as an assistant/secret agent), they each work as much on sabotaging the other's latest success as developing their own skills. This fantastic tale, directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan from the novel by Christopher Priest, might have bowled us over with a few cunning twists; unfortunately, the baffling screenplay reminds one more of H. G. Wells than ""Sleuth"", coming up with a bag of tricks so far-fetched it removes the film's core of inherent reality. The film is remarkably well-dressed and crafted, although the jumpy editing at the start (darting around in time before settling into a more conventional mode of storytelling) is rather a nuisance.

Most of the performances are strong; the best, in my opinion, is Jackman's. Bale is just a step lower. What didn't convince me is the script. It use a series of cross flashbacks which didn't always work well. The plot, very convoluted, is sometimes repetitive. The ""surpise ending"" is not that big surprise if you have paid attention.

That is lesson incorporated in this dark fantasy period piece starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as rival magicians in an intensifying battle to discover the truth of each other. Set with an intelligent, but convoluted plot and a visually alluring design of nineteenth century England, this movie sees director Christopher Nolan delivering his signature filmmaking tropes and bringing them together to form a dazzling mix of fantasy, suspense, and mystery elements in a story that like most of Nolan's works, drives with a fair amount of complexity and emotional twist; though suffers some occasional blemishes in the narrative department. Based on the novel by British author Christopher Priest, the film tells the story of Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Bordon (played by Christian Bale), two magicians who sustain a friendship as assistants for their town's magic shows run by master magician John Cutter (played by Michael Caine).

150,17 August 2008,CitizenCaine,9, Prestigious Film About Magic,"Christopher Nolan always seems to satisfy us with a unique story or way of telling the story. In The Prestige, he does a bit of both. This film about competing magicians who grow increasingly contemptuous of each other is set during the spiritualist craze of Victorian London. Like a Sherlock Holmes story, it feeds us hidden clues carefully woven into its dialog and plot. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are equally compelling and reprehensible as the two competing magicians, and Piper Perabo and Rebecca Hall are the two hapless women in their respective lives. Michael Caine is the marketer and mentor of Hugh Jackman. Scarlett Johansson is the young girl who shifts from one to the other, playing an assistant and mistress. David Bowie is the enigmatic Tesla, disappearing almost completely into character. As with his last film, Batman Begins, Nolan's film contains sumptuous art and set direction, cinematography, and costumes. The soundtrack is also not intrusive, although the audibility of the dialog and volume of the sound throughout the film seem quite low. The film is Hitchcock-like in that its success relies more upon how its executed than individual actors and/or plot points. The film-maker tries distracting us like a magician with shifts in time and points of view changes. It's truly a mesmerizing, multi-layered, and thought-provoking film. Although the film's puzzle may ultimately be deciphered by the discerning viewer, it should not spoil the enjoyment the film provides.

Two magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) compete for the greatest illusion. The stage manager Cutter (Michael Caine) accuses Alfred of attempting to steal Angier's trick but murdering him instead and sends him to jail in the furthest forward storyline. The film operates on multiple story lines, one that follows Robert searching for the great inventor Tesla (David Bowie) and his assistant Alley (Andy Serkis) in Colorado, and another storyline that tells the history of Angier and Borden as young magicians. These stories come from diaries that the men read of each other. Alfred meets Sarah (Rebecca Hall) at a magic show and falls for her quickly. ",

Seeing a few of Chris Nolan's movies, I knew it was going to be good. Boy, it blew me way away! i'll try not to give too much of the story away, (for it is so cunning and amazing with scheming). It's about two magicians in competition (Jackman) and (Bale) who try to gain fortune and glory, but also learn and reveal to the masses of the ultimate magic trick. both set off in a face/off of lies, deceit, obsession, greed, pride, and murder that can lead to serious consequences. That's all I'm going to reveal of the story, for it is so cunning and amazing with scheming that when yo think you've figured it out...think again! It has a powerful all-star cast. Hugh Jacman and Christain Bale were an awesome couple of foes, who deserve some recognition in the Oscars. especially Jackman, for he plays a very ambivalent character; not to mention the rest, Scarlett Johansen was both good-looking and had talent, Michael Caine was absolutely fabulous, which he always was, and a surprise guest star of Andy Serkis was also really decent in his role.",

It is about deception. By the end, Robert Angier (Jackman) is a magician for totally different reasons than when he started, and I think this quote shows his obsession not just to be a better magician than Borden (Bale), but to make Borden crash and burn.

The rivalry becomes soul intuitive with each others lives that there ended up sacrifice in their social lives and sabotaging one another to the point that they even show up in disguises. The choice to set it in the 19 century was a good decision given that this was the golden age of showman and magicians, The production design is wonderful,costumes are appropriate for the time.

I didn't pay much attention to my date. I was completely entranced by this movie. Normally I can detect upcoming plot twists and foreshadowing gives everything away to me. But in The Prestige... it's an exceptionally excellent plot. I was terribly surprised... not that it was terrible... it was exciting. The acting is superb. Absolutely and powerfully believable. I get very into things, like books, video games, and especially movies. Watching this movie got rather intense. The effects are amazing. It's a bit of a fairy tale but it seems so real. As someone put it, The Prestige is ""storytelling at it's best."" I concur, 100%. I am making a list of movies you must see before you die. The Prestige is definitely on it.

There is not much to say that this is an extremely entertaining film, that does everything right. With all of the twists most of which I did not see coming. I had a feeling about the twin, but not 100% percent sure. Since Cutter was a character outside of the movie I was sure he was right about the body double and that could only be achieved by his brother, but as a viewer I wanted to believe that part was magic. I just read a few arguments that people have about the movie and I try to instigate discussions at the end of movies (like I like to do with Pan's Labrynth), but I think this movie really did a good job of remember that this was just a movie and listening to Christopher Nolan's commentary on the making of the film, but tells me that the whole point of this movie was to trick the viewer into believing what we saw was real, not because we actually believe, but because we want to. I think the end with Jackman's character was unnecessary and conflicted with the character and it should have been left that Bale's character was not only the better magician, but the better human being. The performances were great especially Caine's. The accent's slipped a few times on the main characters, but still over all a great 2 hours of my life.

In addition to showing the historical Tesla, we see a little about the world of illusions from the late eighteenth century, such a surreal way that now seem magical, talking about magic, it's cool as the film makes clear that the real magic is the science and that the obsessions are not worth the price of those we love.

Magic is a hard subject to resist. There is a part within all of us that has an avid curiosity and need to know how to explain the unexplainable. Of course, once it's revealed, almost all interest is lost, and it seems it's time to move onto the next thing. The Prestige tells a lot. I won't venture too far for fear of giving too much away, but while much is revealed in this film, there is still a lot to scratch your head over as the final credits roll (to a magnificent Thom Yorke song I might add).

182,30 October 2006,colonel_green,10, A marvelously intricate construction.,"Christopher Nolan's previous films show him to be a master of plotting and misdirection, even in a relatively straightforward superhero film like ""Batman Begins."" Here, with Batman and Wolverine headlining his production (Batman, amusingly, plays a character named Alfred), he weaves another elaborate mystery set in Victorian Britain, as two stage magicians vie for prominence (when I first heard about this film, it reminded me of the novel ""Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"", which was set in the Regency). Bale and Jackman bring little trace of their previous roles (especially Jackman), and have able support from Michael Caine, Scarlett Johanssen (in a rather throwaway part), and Rebecca Hall. However, the real surprise of the film is an astonishing performance from David Bowie as inventor Nikola Tesla; Bowie is incredible in this part, and one almost wishes for a movie about him. Much like a J.K. Rowling novel, the delight of this movie is the way in which Nolan scatters numerous clues to what is really going on through the proceedings, only to pull out a series of fantastic plot twists the cast a whole new light on everything we've see happen previous to this. There are several huge twists at the end of this film, any one of which alone would seem to be enough, until Nolan contorts the plot again, and things still hold together. I highly recommend this stellar production.",

In a lot of interviews, he mentioned that most movies anymore aren't even stories, but rather a single circumstance that the director just lives up to for two hours. And that's exactly the problem The Prestige and every other Nolan film has. Nolan just takes one boring concept, then attempts to stretch it out into a long-winded, boring movie by use of his watered-down metafiction directing style. If The Prestige would have been the idea of any other director, they would have at least added SOMETHING to the one-track story or cut it down to half the time so it would have at least been slightly less tedious to sit though.",

191,28 February 2007,timhayes-1,9, The magic is in not knowing,"The Prestige is for my money, one of the best films on the subject of magic. Christopher Nolan has created a film that, like his earlier film Memento, plays on audience perception. The film is even presented like a magic trick. In magic there is the pledge in which the audience is shown something ordinary. At the start of the film we are shown a trick gone wrong as Hugh Jackman dies, drowning in a glass cage. The turn is where the magician performs the trick. For this film, the turn is the bulk of the storyline as we bounce back and forth through time following Angiers (Jackman) and fellow magician Borden (Christian Bale) as they study and master magic tricks. A tragic accident causes Angiers wife to die and a rivalry to grow between the two magicians. We watch as Angiers grows increasingly obsessed in his search for the secrets of Borden's tricks. Borden in the present tense of the story is on trial and sentenced to hang for Angiers death. Mixing these events, Nolan tantalizes the audience with many sleights of hand which will leave you guessing. It is only the end, or the prestige of the trick that all is revealed and we see how this story has truly played out. While I won't give up the twist, it is a very fun twist that does nothing to dampen the rest of the film. The Prestige is dark to be sure but there have been darker films over the years. Kudos go to Michael Caine, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale for standout performances and to Nolan for a superb script and nuanced direction. Give this one a go.",

I hate movies that leave you with a bad taste in your mouth and this one certainly did for me. It seems stupid to me that Borden had a twin brother that nobody knew about.

209,28 September 2017,spencergrande6,9," The film works, it really does, even when it's less than artful",Rewatching this makes it pretty clear what Nolan's primary focus is in storytelling (if it wasn't obvious before) - perspective and the subjective nature of it. What better way to expound on that than in a story about dueling magicians hiding their secrets from one another.,

The third outing to come (The Prestige), however, is his real follow-up to Memento, in my own honest little opinion, both in quality as well as in depth.",
215,24 April 2007,merklekranz,3, The Prestige vs The Illusionist,"Although both movies have certain similarities, Victorian, magicians, beautiful people, twist endings, there is one huge difference, ""The Illusionist"" is enjoyable while ""The Prestige"" is a pretentious, manipulated, confusing, mess. The character development is especially weak, the accents barely intelligible, and the time jumps annoying. If the movie had played out in an orderly fashion, it might have proved more enjoyable. I cannot recommend ""The Prestige"". If you must see a magical movie, and enjoy being manipulated toward a twist ending, then ""The Illusionist"" is your movie. At least it makes a little bit of sense. Rate ""The Illusionist"" 7.0, ""The Prestige"" 3.0 - MERK",
216,21 October 2006,DJAkin,1, Not THAT Presgious,"I went to this movie expecting to be blown away. After the amazing movie with EDWARD NORTON, I was expecting too much. This movie was OK, don't get me wrong. The scene at the end when Wolverine is talking to Christian Bale was Oscar WORTHY to say the least. However, I grew tired of the cockney accent that Bale had through the entire flick. The ending was a bit contrived. Sure, this movie had a good ending but it was a little too strange with the entire TWIN thing. I didn't see that coming. I guess I should have read the book, no? Oh where should I begin on the plot? It was very strange to see Tesla being portrayed by David Bowie. That was a very weird part of this entire movie. Did Tesla really build stuff in the mountains of Colorado? Who knows. All I know is that Michael Caine was so so in this movie and the plot was not that great.",
217,23 October 2006,moviegeek310,9," Prestige a fun, well made, dark film.","If you compare the book to the movie, the book is actually better. A month before ""The Prestige"" was released I started reading Christopher Priest's award winning book of the same name. I was totally engrossed in it, not only was it a page turner, but it also was an extremely fun read. Not once did I think, ""Oh wow, this is getting boring,"" like most books I read. I was even thinking of writing a review of it because it was so well written, but instead I'll tell you now, READ IT! The book was extremely different from the film, director Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins) took a lot of liberties. But since the two are so different I won't compare them anymore, I'll just talk about the movie. ",
218,28 October 2006,gaiderdraco,3, The Prestige doesn't work due to acute predictability,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" is a very good looking movie and is very well acted. That having been said Chris Nolan plants so many winks toward the audience and little hints everywhere so that the ""not so average"" movie goer could see where it is leading one hour into the film. I did and so I am greatly disappointed.",

Throughout that journey it is secretly building up to something that will make you shiver, make your jaw drop, but most of all make you absolutely love this movie. There's no stage where you find yourself wondering can I continue to sit through this, even at 130 minutes. Every scene, every line, every last word is acted out perfectly. I'm not sure whether it was the brilliant acting or simply the gripping, intriguing storyline itself which made this film so enjoyable throughout and not just when the twist is eventually revealed. Possibly it was both.",
225,12 January 2021,Harry_Gleeson,9, Nolan's Magic Trick,"Overall, The Prestige is a mind-boggling but special film. Christopher Nolan performs his own magic on the audience by consuming us in a world that is filled with twists and turns at every corner. Everything about the film is genius in my view, although it will take multiple viewings to fully understand the point of the film. However, when I understood what had happened, I has amazed. The performances, music, writing is superb, and this is a very underrated film that is not talked about in the way other Nolan films are. This is a great film that every film lover should see, go treat yourself!",

Most satisfying if you're up to following the unexpected details, but it must have been frustrating for the releasing studio to try and figure our how to SELL the film when it first came out.",
229,11 September 2022,RonellSowes,5, More Intricate Than Clever,"The Prestige is a bag of tricks, an enigma inside another that misdirects and, at least tries to, suprise you till the end. However, while it's certainly intricately put together it's more complex than clever. The core twist isn't that hard to guess and the only part you might not expect if you aren't to familiar with it is the aspect which classifies it as a fantasy. Although in a movie that's almost entirely 'real' it's almost out of place to inject sci-fi.",
230,26 January 2021,davidmvining,8, More than just clever,"A combination of John McTiernan, Brian DePalma, and Stanley Kubrick with Christopher Nolan's signature brand of non-linear storytelling, The Prestige is a tale of obsession, narrative storytelling, and trickery. Having the advantage of over a decade and several viewings, I feel bad for those tasked with the assignment to write about this film upon its initial release. This is a very clever movie, and it can be hard to discern, on an initial viewing, if there's more than the cleverness so clearly on display. I would say that yes, very firmly there is more than just the trickery.",
231,22 February 2007,jpintar,5, overrated,"A better title for this movie should have been ""Two Jerks as Magicians."" This movie contained two of the most unlikable characters maybe in movie history. Hugh Jackman and Christian play rival magicians who try to outdo each other. Both sacrifice personally for their actions. Scarlett Johansson play the woman caught between th two. She realizes that both of these guys are jerks. So why does the movie tack some kind of mega happy ending where one character lives happily ever after. This film cries out for a darker ending in which both Bale and Jackman get their comeuppance at the end. If you want a story about magic, watch The Illusionist instead. It is superior to this movie in every way shape and form.",
232,22 December 2006,dingoberserk,2, Oh what a tangled web...,"When I left the cinema after watching 'The Prestige', I tried to make head or tail of its storyline and eventually had to give up. This movie is a hotchpotch of unclear situations, flashbacks, mysterious allusions to the extent that in the end nothing makes much sense. Some of the comments on this website did help clarify a number of issues, but in the end the tortuous plot and the all-too-frequent twists and turns had me throw in the towel. It is to be regretted that, in order to ensure the success (?) of a movie, film directors have to resort to irritating 'postmodern' techniques requiring an above-average IQ and a PhD in cinema studies. Oh, for the simplicity and directness of 'Snowwhite and the seven dwarfs'! Among the many unresolved issues, one detail continues to exercise my mind: what is the significance of the small red ball which continues to be thrown at some of the characters and is then thrown back to the sender?",
233,23 August 2008,RagingR2,7," Nice movie, but the ""twist"" effect is growing a beard","I liked this movie in that it's a nice story with interesting characters, beautiful imagery and decent actors. But like many other movies in the last years, this movie has a surprising plot twist at the end. In this movie I didn't particularly like it, and probably for two reasons. The first and main one is, the whole ""plot twist"" thing is getting rather old if you ask me. We've seen so many of these movies lately (The Sixth Sense, The Others, The Village, The Usual Suspects, Memento, The Illusionist, The Score, Unbreakable, etc. etc.) that it doesn't really impress anymore. Oh sure, it's nice to catch the viewers by surprise and say ""Ha! You didn't see that coming, did you?"" But then again, is it really that hard? In a world where the viewer is *expected* to ""suspend his disbelief"" and the writer has all the power to either show or not show information, you can make your viewers believe anything. In the beginning, or at least what was the beginning of this ""genre"" for me (The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects), it was still funny and unexpected. You felt tricked and kinda stupid when you learned the truth. But the more of these films you see, the more you realize how easy it is to surprise someone if you have absolute control over what information is or isn't shown. And, the more far-fetched the plot twists seem to get, which is the 2nd reason I wasn't really impressed by the ending of this film. It seems to have become a silly game among film makers much like the game in this film: a match to see who is best able to trick their audience, and who can come up with an even more insane plot twist. In this case it is insane indeed, or rather an insult the viewers intelligence if you want my opinion. Sure, just pull a proverbial bunny out of a hat by the end of the film like ""Hey, what about THIS then eh?"". Yeah, unexpected indeed, but cheap, really cheap. As someone else commented on this film: the makers seem to have worried more about delivering the best plot twist to date, than about making a good film, and executing the twist properly and credibly. Half way through the film, I was no longer really bothered by the issue that, at the end of the film, the plot twist appeared to offer a solution for. Part of this is because my ""suspension of disbelief"" had pushed the whole issue to the background. And part of it is because the film just doesn't keep you focused. There's so much other stuff going on that you aren't really sure what to look for. At a certain point I was waiting for unexpected answers when I didn't know what the question was.",

It is beautifully designed and crafted, with lush and never too eye-popping cinematography while still remaining quietly beautiful. All the set and costume design perfectly emulates the Victorian time period without ever seeming like it's trying to hard. On the contrary  as a historic presentation, it is a very fascinating portrayal of a form of entertainment that reached indescribable peaks of popularity during this particular time period. From a technical standpoint, the film is a sleek and stylish success.",
237,1 January 2007,dwpollar,9," Amazing, complex story of trickery and deception...","1st watched 1/1/2007 - 9 out of 10(Dir-Christopher Nolan): Amazing, complex story of trickery and deception put together by a Director who appears to be becoming a master in this field, which he started in his first movie, Memento. Christopher Nolan starts off with a simple story of a man accused of the murder of another man. They both happen to be in the same field of magic and we're major competitors in this arena. We then are taken backwards to the events that led up to this supposed murder. This is where the movie becomes extremely complex and is driven by the wonderful subtle performances of everyone involved. This is one of those movies where you don't want to miss any points of dialogue because you're afraid you'll miss out on something important, and with Nolan, you will be. He is able to sustain a mostly dialogue-driven movie for over two hours and your mind is still racing as the final credits roll. The magicians', played by Hugh Jackman & Christian Bale, personal battles are the major focus which started when Jackman's character's wife is killed during a failed magic trick where he blames Bale's character. But also entering unto the scene is the idea of performing the ultimate illusion by possible using ""real magic"", which in this case is electricity re-directed to transpose a person from one place to another. This is being tested by a man named Tesla, played wonderfully by the rock star/actor David Bowie, as the government & Thomas Edison vehemently tries to pull the plug & funding to shutdown the experiments. This subplot was a personal revelation to me because of a song by a group coincidentally called Tesla, called ""Edison's medicine"", which suggests trickery & under-handed things being done so he could gain the rights to electricity. Anyway, back to the movie--- All of these elements are blended together so well that the only reason I didn't give the movie a 10 is because of the confusion at the end(wish was actually part of the fun of the movie, but could be distracting to some). It would amaze me if a better movie was made in 2006, but it probably won't win the Oscar because it's too thought-provoking, which is too bad. I will be anxiously awaiting another Christopher Nolan movie though, as I'm sure many other people are as well.",
238,8 June 2007,dromasca,7," good, but slightly over-rated","By now we know that the unexpected would be for Christopher Nolan to make an expected film. Yet, 'The Prestige' is to some extend the most expected film of Nolan until now. It is an adaptation of a novel about the rivalry between two magicians turned into a life long obsessive fight, and although we do find interesting issues like the relationship between perception and reality and the border between life and illusion for an artist, the overall script is too much conventional in structure. The most disappointing is the ending, sure, we get an explanation for much of what we have seen, and the explanation makes sense, but then the magic is gone. You do not explain magic and expect for magic to stay.",
239,18 March 2020,Mnemosyne15,8, The trickiest magic in the world is the knot in your heart.,"If the magic in the magician is called magic, then the magic in this movie can only be called acrobatics. This movie is tearing through the magical secrets from beginning to end. All the mysteries are so bland after being broken, but they paid too much to know the bland results. At the last moments of the two magicians, I don't know if there will be remorse in their hearts. I guess they will regret it for a moment, but they will do it again. In one breath, it is sometimes harder to swallow than to swallow a bullet.",
240,18 August 2009,Vishal_s_kumar,9, Are you watching closely??,"When Christopher Nolan made his debut into American cinemas with Memento, film-lovers witnessed the first rumblings of a creative genius who brought innovation and artistic flair to theaters with his unique visual and narrative style. Since that time, I've eagerly awaited each of his subsequent films with the hope that his unique cinematic style would continue to develop. I haven't been disappointed. In 2005, Mr. Nolan directed what many fans believe to be, arguably, the best of the Batman films, finding both critical and box-office success. As a surprise to those expecting a sequel to Batman Begins, Mr. Nolan has instead produced a subtly staggering film about personal and professional rivalry between two magicians. The Prestige finds Mr. Nolan again in top form and re-teaming with his Batman Begins star, Christian Bale.",

The second act is called ""The Turn""; The magician makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary.

Christopher Nolan makes yet another remarkable achievement after the groundbreaking Memento and the extraordinary Batman Begins. Once again, Nolan does not for a moment prioritize the ""Ooohs!"" and ""Ahhhs!"" before strong character development and plot. By the end, Nolan can use these powerful cinematic tools to create those audience reactions instead of fantastical elements. Nolan is not the only one, however, that makes this movie work as a whole. With his brother, Jonathan Nolan, at the hands of the screenplay, and Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as the leads, people reading this review are only getting the tip of the iceberg with understanding the quality of this movie.

Here is a film based on literature, on vibrant and original characters, with actors who can show others what is like to inhabit their roles and do their best every time they on screen. Both Bale and Jackman are at the top of their game, complementing what the other does in order to put on quite a show, pretty much like the protagonists in the story, they appear to be outdoing each other, but in reality they are just both doing work that enhances and makes the entire film a joy to watch.",

251,31 January 2007,manicman84,9, this stylish thriller perfectly works on many levels,"The Prestige is a stylish thriller, story about obsession, magic trick and metaphor of a film art at the same time. Thanks to director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins) the movie perfectly works on every level. On the most obvious level - it is a superbly shot thriller keeping in a heart-pounding suspense with numerous twists and turns. As regards psychology, we have a dangerous obsession with searching for something new and an intense rivalry between two different personalities, which is reliable owing to excellent performances by two leads - Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. Their characters are not only obsessed with personal ambitions, but they also resign from family life by hurting people they love. In the allegorical sense, the flick is an overt metaphor of the magic trick in which creators show more things than actually communicate and viewers' aim is to decipher a riddle. Besides, they often reveal secrets concerning the enchantment. Finally, Nolan focuses on a labourious creation process. Filmmakers, just like illusionists in this movie, do everything within their power in order to amuse viewers and the effect is sometimes incommensurate to their hard work and devoted time. To conclude, The Prestige is a first-rate cinematic experience which both criticizes and glorifies film-making.",

Christian Bale puts on an acting clinic. Nolan flips everything on its head with the non-linear storytelling and perfectly lines up the story's secrets to be revealed. The story is structured just like a magic trick. Nolan reveals a normal rivalry. He then shows something peculiar about the rivalry, a murder. Then Nolan brings the character back in the prestige. He does this not once but twice! He does it so cleverly that the audience does not know what has happened till its already over. Possibly the greatest twist in cinematic history!",
256,16 March 2009,lopcar1993,10, Amazing film!! One of the best of the decade!!,"I've seen some movies that try to blow your mind, I've seen some movies that try to challenge you and make you believe in the unimaginable. The Prestige does both, it challenges you while making you think you know what is going on and just when you have it all figured out it throws a Monkey wrench into your plans and leaves you totally baffled and dumbfounded even after the ending, so the real question is what is true in this film? and what is a lie? The Prestige Is brilliant, taunt, dark, sinister, sadistic, malicious, vicious need I go on? It's a film that you can revile in and admire for it's complex nature and dark themes. It's one of the most convincing and thought provoking period pieces I've ever seen since Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. It enters your mind and slowly but surely starts to poke at your brain and make you think what you know and believe is nothing but an elaborate hoax, a smoke screen to blind you from the truth that is buried underneath the complexity of this film it brings out the first basic law of life. Kill or be killed. And this film takes that meaning to a whole new extreme it uses treachery, betrayal, murder and deception to fully tell and improve the main basis of the plot and to bring out the dark nature that revenge has on a man's soul. All in all this film is nothing short of a brilliant and taunt masterpiece.",
257,24 January 2008,hannah8700-1,9, Abracadabra!,"What a fantastic, suspenseful, exciting film! This movie kept you on the edge of your sit the entire time. It made you ask yourself questions and second guess yourself. You can't just watch this movie once. You have to watch it again and again to figure out who is who, what they're doing, and why they're doing it. The tag-line on the front cover of the DVD pins it perfectly: ""You want to see it again the second it's over!"" I think I've finally got everything figured out now that I've watched it about five times. You learn something new that you missed or didn't see every time you watched it before. But that's why it's so great! Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors and he was phenomenal as the mysterious Alfred Borden. His was the most versatile and dynamic role and he truly made the movie a success. I liked him more as the real Alfred Borden, the one who loved Sarah, rather than his ""twin."" It was just so amazing how he was able to play both different versions of himself simultaneously. Christian Bale is a very talented actor- one of the best. You also see the dark side of Hugh Jackman and honestly I really didn't like his character much. He really lost sight of what was important and just went too far. In the end he was a completely different person, evil almost. The movie had a fair but just ending. And I thought Rebecca Hall also deserves an honorable mention for her small role in the film as Borden's wife. She played a key role in helping to determine exactly which ""Alfred Borden"" it was on screen at the time and I thought it was very unique how they did that. All in all, this movie was genius- magical even!",

It's reliance on impossible, rather than speculative, science making it ever so slightly ridiculous to this confirmed rationalist. The best feature of the book by far was the complicated narrative methods it used. Needless to say this is totally lost in Nolan's tricksy film. The narrative here is disjointed, not for any obvious effect, but seemingly because this is now Nolan's style, a style he will use regardless of how appropriate it is to the film. What we end up with though is an uninteresting tale badly told, devoid of humour or life. Christian Bale is as mannered as ever, after several films in which he got to use his unconvincing American accent he now sounds equally unconvincing as a cockney. Hugh Jackman is slightly more watchable but Scarlett Johannson is wasted and Bowie as embarrassing as ever. Watching this back to back with the less feted ""The Illusionist"" is instructive, that film was as predictable and old fashioned as could be, it was at least entertaining and Edward Norton runs rings round Bale.",

We had the obligatory Scorsese film a couple weeks ago and now we have the return of one of Hollywood's new favorite sons (who also began with intelligent and original indie visions like Marty) with Christopher Nolan's The Prestige. Known for uniquely dark and smart suspense thrillers, Nolan has crafted a tale of mysterious intrigue concerning two rival magicians vying to be the greatest to have ever lived. One is a performer of high esteem (Hugh Jackman), if not talented enough to create his own tricks, and the other a wizard with sleight of hand (Christian Bale) yet stoic and matter-of-fact with his audience.

If you watch the previews to both, you'll find it nearly impossible to tell apart, since they're both about magicians in 1890s England, both starring dark haired men, women with full lips, and an older mentor gentleman.

The story is about the twist and turns, flash-backs and magic-tricks. The plot is set up in early 20th century London. The direction is good. By the time the movie is little bit more than half  way over, you will realize the possibility of the mystery that the director is trying to evade your eyes. Than the remaining movie you will watch just to see whether the director brings a new turn to the story, and does it not match your sense of analysis. To mine it matched  but the movie is a bit beyond our knowing director's mystery.

It's not necessarily bad though. The Prestige is typical Nolan filmmaking. There are no notable performances even though the cast consists of some of the most famous actors working today. Only David Bowie and Hugh Jackman make somewhat of an impression. The film is heavy-going and long. Nolan continues to aim for the noir look, but he can't capture it well in his film projects. So the film ends up being too dark and somber for its own good. The ending is meant to be clever, but with Nolan's direction it doesn't feel that way. Still, it's a solid release overall. There's nothing to distinguish it, however. Like all other films by Nolan it's overrated. He is not a great filmmaker. This is a man who's been influenced by Ridley Scott and the Wachowski brothers. He rarely comes up with anything original, and just continues to copy them. I don't recommend watching The Prestige. The magic tricks here are nothing to get excited about. Nolan erroneously aims for realism, but this approach leaves a bad taste in the mouth. This is far from being anywhere near Steven Spielberg's genius.",

Angier and Borden, one chose the inhuman technology and since then kept wondering whether he is real or a substitute, and the other chose the inhuman life, living two people into one person. In the values of this movie, the greatest sacrifice should be to endure the life, not to die. Once people get caught in the excessive obsession, it is equivalent to the active exposure of their weaknesses. Borden made use of Angier's obsession with magic to send him to the US. Angier made use of Borden's obsession to trick him into the background and completed his murder.

It seems that in most Nolan's film, the ending scene always appears at the opening but his narrative style however manages to make audiences to forget that regardless on the complexity of the content he tries to confuse us, it is actually a straightforward plot with the key answers already revealed indirectly at the first scene. The performances of Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are extremely outstanding, thanks to the character developments that allow them to be both the antagonist and protagonist at the same time due to their eagerness for glory that they have eroded not only the morality of this magical great art, but to sacrifice their own lives and the one they love. The duality is a brilliant central concept of the film extracted in two different ways on both leads, it never stops engaging but to challenge the mindset of the viewers with several dark twisted plots and ambiguity. Although with a bit of weaker scores (due to no Hans Zimmer), Nolan's smart piece of magical art is interesting to stress that the trick of victory comes only when a person overlook and think that he has already won the rival.",

Having enjoyed Nolan's first two films immensely, being slightly disappointed by his third ( though I have this feeling I need to give it a second chance) and totally digging his fourth.come one Bale as Batman it's a no brainer! Needless to say I didn't quite know what to expect. Part of me felt this was a little side film in the interim between Bat flicks (stupidI know that now) Part of me was hoping he hadn't completely gone Hollywood. Literally 30 seconds into The Prestige and all doubts just floated away. Nolan is back in a big way, and I cant emphasize this next statement enough.if you haven't seen this film get off you're a$$ right now and see it. Stop reading this review and just go!! What can I say? I was utterly blown away by this film. Everything was amazing about it, the story ( who knew a film about magicians could be this good), the cinematography, the editing/pacing, the performances all top notch. It is a film that is at least on par w/his previous work and arguably his best so far. One of the best times I've had at the movies everand I see a lot of films. You see I went in not knowing much other than this was a new Nolan film and the cast. I hadn't even a seen a trailer yet. Perhaps this was why I was in such awe of the story. Though that's not it entirely, the story combined with its non linear presentation has this way of grabbing hold of you and not letting go until the finale. The structure is brilliant, with out giving to much away the film is for the most part told from journal entries being read by the films two leads. The story is told in a non-linear fashion that is a bit confusing but you will quickly get a a handle on things. Or maybe I'm just slower than everyone else lol. I could go on forever about how ever aspect of the film was brilliant but that would just be time your not watching the filmand quite honestly if you've already seen it then you already know. Or maybe you don't and you think I'm a complete dork for digging this silly film about magicians.",
296,31 January 2007,demon-drifter,10, A Masterpiece of Originality,"It is not often that we are given the privilege to see a truly original story, not a remake with different faces and effects but instead a unique tale. It is a regular complaint by movie enthusiasts that the business is dominated by copied or reworked story lines. This film has consistently pushed the boundaries just as the Matrix did when it was first released. Not many movies can boast such a debate over the tiny details or the implications of the actions of each character. When the machine is first seen in its detail, the ruthlessness of Angier is truly discovered. While movies such as the Sixth Day attempt to debate the ethics of such a device, The Prestige simply uses it to highlight the greed and burning ambition of a man. This movie is very complex in its themes and plot and it is encouraging to see a film that forces the viewer to think and review the storyline again and again to try and determine the truth. Is it not also ironic that while we the viewers are attempting to seek the truth, so the characters are seeking to disillusion us, just like a magic act. We are forced, in a sense, into volunteering for the magician which shows us in the end how incredibly well thought out this storyline really is. Cutter seems to sum it all up for us - 'Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it because you're not really looking. You don't really want to know the secret... You want to be fooled.'",

Who ever thought that a story on eighteenth century magicians could be so interesting, involving and damn it, I have to agree it was deceptive, it does not fit in with the mind boggling sci-fi movie category but the script was so well written, that one cant just appreciate the movie if he does not get involved with it. The logic for a part of the ending can be conceived with many possible start points, but the beauty of this movie is, whatever be the start point and whatever be the path of your reasoning, you'll end up saying ""wow"" to the end.

The story is deeply personal and the characters are easy to sympathize with. My problem with this film is the ending, it's rather weak and feels like it was put together at the last minute. A dying Hugh Jackman miraculously has the time and energy to narrate a long, complicated soliloquy wrapping things up for Christian Bale, who also contributes with a corny soap opera plot contrivance about being a twin. The other thing that bothered me was that they found an exact duplicate for Hugh Jackman. See what I mean, corny. I knew there would be a twist ending, I expected it to be that their doubles killed each other and the original magicians were both still alive, that would have made more sense. The ending to Nolan's films appear to be generally weak, the ending to Interstallar was unsatisfying, and The Dark Knight just seems to end, and Inception is sort of lame.

304,13 March 2007,diac228,6, Seems like some of the film is missing..because not everything adds up...,"In a magic trick it usually consists of a hook, line, and sinker. The magician presents the scenario, proves its impossibility, and then defies the odds. How the trick is pulled off, magicians usually don't reveal. In movie-making however, it doesn't quite work in the same fashion. If you present a film that raises questions and the end of the final act does not answer them, then you have yourself a panned and wildly criticized film. The only kinds of questions that can remain unanswered are that which bare little importance to the main plot itself. Tarantino mastered this, by giving unanswered questions to almost all his films (Best example: Briefcase in Pulp Fiction). The Prestige however, suffers awfully from being unable to answer important questions. While the movie itself is entertaining, albeit a bit long, it fails to wrap up the story the way really good films do, like its rival 2006 magician hit The Illusionist. The hook and line are bearable to watch, but the sinker fails to satisfy. While it did give its nice twists and turns, The Prestige does not leave a satisfying finish.",

The layered narrative worked quite well for me, especially since it contributes to the plot twists, and I never felt confused at all. I loved that it was as much horror as fantasy or drama.

The movie says nothing about ambition or the quest for perfection or any of the other deep stuff people pretend to see in it.

309,20 February 2017,filipemanuelneto,6, An interesting story about two disgusting characters.,"This film addresses the intense rivalry between two illusionists who try to overcome and injure each other after a serious and fatal accident in a joint show. It's a story of unbridled rivalry, revenge, pride and vanity. The film has many merits but the main one is the script, the story that tells us. There are some more predictable parts, others seem initially incomprehensible until the movie explains everything. The ending is one of the most positive aspects as it's totally unexpected and, in fact, makes everything else worthwhile. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman played the main characters, working very well together and showing us the best of each other. They are brilliantly aided by veteran Michael Caine and by Scarlett Johansson. David Bowie is a surprise, but was quite reasonable in the role of the famous physicist Tesla. In fact, the whole cast did a good job and met expectations, at times when it failed to shine. However, the great problem of this film is precisely the characters. They are detestable, especially the magicians. No one was able to deserve my sympathy and, deep down, I was glad to see both of them being punished for their wickedness. Caine, in his character, mirrored this repulsion very well at certain scenes. And while Tesla's machine allowed a good increment to the story, the way it was done was so far-fetched that it spoiled the movie a bit, too. Anyway, it's a good movie with a very interesting story, fulfilling well its mission to entertain and surprise the public.",

And everything else in the lives of the two must submit to this situation.",

As you might have gathered already, there are revelations at the end that force you to reinterpret everything you've already seen. The second time through, it's a different movie. Now, this trick has been pulled off before (most famously by THE SIXTH SENSE), but what makes THE PRESTIGE unique is that our identification with the characters changes once we know what was really going on, and the movie, which on first viewing is flawed only by a slight coldness, becomes profoundly emotional.",

I thoroughly enjoyed it. It had so many twists and turns and kept me guessing until the very end! Christian Bale plays Alfred Borden, a gifted magician who's tricks are so mind-boggling that they seem almost impossible to perform. Hugh Jackman plays Robert Angier, an equally talented magician who is good friends with Borden. But one night during a show one of Angier's tricks goes horribly wrong and his wife Julia, played by Piper Perabo, is killed. And Borden is partially blamed for the accident because he tied the ropes on Julia's hands differently. As a result of the accident Angier and Borden become rivals. They show up at each other's shows and make their tricks malfunction. One night Borden performs a trick so mind-boggling and visual that Angier sets out on a quest to find out how exactly he did it. His search for the answer delves him deeper into the mind of Borden and what really happened to his wife during that fateful trick.",

Still, if there's one criticism I'd level at THE PRESTIGE, it's this: magic there is here but no poetry (the closest it comes is in the scene where the snow is 'lit' up and when Hugh Jackman stumbles upon the transported hats); having just rewatched Georges Franju's JUDEX (1963), I felt this most strongly - what it needed, perhaps, was a more evocative score (a' la Maurice Jarre's haunting theme for that film). Likewise, I somewhat regret the fact that the settings and the detail had to be so realistic - but I can see how this was vital to the psychology (which is, basically, what drives the plot in the first place!).",

It starts with a simple magic act going wrong due to certain circumstances in which like every trick, there is a disguise, someone who moves our concentration from the real thing.In this case,The rival magician is present at the place of the unfortunate act, due to which he is accused of being the spoil sport and hence the murderer.This first act takes the viewers to the next act,which apparently in this film is set in the flashback of these rival magicians life.This act is full of contriving twists that feels like magic tricks(confusing).Here you really hope that the writer better have some good reasons for the unfolding events and good reasons he has which is the final act and that is The prestige.Just when you feel that justice is not done,the dark twist actually makes you feel good at the end and you are given an unintentional message that magic tricks are eventually small illusion which should not be delved in deeper studies with science as the fulcrum. They are all illusions and should remain as the acts and art(not science) of illusion. All in all a great film and a perfect magic act.Good to see that it has already entered in the list of top 250 films of all time.",

I mean genuinely surprised me. The film is about rival stage magicians, rife with their lingo and culture, but more importantly, the film works much like a magic trick or illusion, offering its own misdirections while showing you everything. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were both superb as the obsessed magicians. Scarlett Johansson and Piper Perabo were very good as supporting female leads, though one of the best performances in the film was from Rebecca Hall. She made me want to look up her filmography. Michael Caine and the few others in immediate supporting roles were all good. I've heard mixed things about David Bowie's appearance in this film, but I think he was just fine; his appearance is more an extended cameo than anything else. The sets are authentic looking for the period, the writing is excellent, and even the music was excellent, if a bit subtle. The direction was superb, as was the editing. This is the rare film that gets everything right while telling a compelling story. It combines solid drama with an intriguing mystery and more than a hint of the fantastic I am hesitant to say anything about the plot, other than it concerns rival stage magicians in late nineteenth century London. Even the trailers for the film show precious little, probably for the same reason. Well worth the price of admission, I urge those interested to see it while its on the big screen.",

335,23 August 2011,nunoaraujoduarte,10, movieinthepark.blogspot.com,"Back in town, Chris Nolan gave the world one of his best masterpieces. He's without any doubt one of the best directors of the current times. There ain't who does better breathtaking mysteries and sharp thrillers that just delight who ever enjoys mind breaking stories. With The Prestige, Nolan explores the fruitful world of magics. The story's about two magicians, somewhere around 1900. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). At first they were helping a magician performing his acts. The major act consisted in tying Angier's wife's hands (Julia (Piper Perabo)) and drop her in a cage filled with water. A huge cloth would came down covering it and when it was pushed back up Julia should have already untied the knot and escaped from the cage. Before a show, Angier, Borden and the engineer of illusions, Cutter (Michael Caine) argued about which knot should be used, as Borden defended that another knot to replace the one being used, but both Angier and Cutter refused. In that exact show, Julia drowns inside the cage. Angier immediately blames Borden. Angier and Borden take different paths, Angier hires Cutter as his engineer and Borden Bernard Fallon as his. Angier also hires Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson) to help him on stage. Meanwhile, Borden meets and marries Sarah (Rebecca Hall). Performing a trick that Borden called The Bullet Catch, Angier shows up in a Borded's show offering himself to volunteer and tricks Borden, injuring him severely on two fingers. Progressively, competitiveness grows between both. The plot develops with this competition, as each one of them creates the most elaborate and schemer acts of London and try to uncover the partner's in order to beat him. It's amazing how Nolan concentrates the mystery of the tricks until the very last moments, focusing all the answers in the end. If the viewer focuses on certain details he might find possible to unveil the actual solution but my own experience tells me that is not very likely to happen. Hugh Jack is good, better that he accustomed us, but Chritian Bale ruled. I'm not his biggest fan but the truth is there ain't a lot of actors doing better than him nowadays. The truth is that this movie actually has some historical accuracy. For example, Nikola Tesla did in fact experiment in Colorado Springs, building including the Magnifying Transmitter, shown in the movie. But I didn't like some aspects of the tricks, mostly about using impossible magic in this movie. It really works against the movie. In spite of that, this mystery thriller is one of the best I've seen. And yes it's true. You want to see it again the second it's over. 10/10",

The problem is the plot and the script which simply have too many holes, compounded by confusing presentation which jumps back and forth through time and expects the audience to keep up.

350,5 October 2020,Ianmcane,3, Thoroughly flaccid,"What is it with the hero-worshipping of Christopher Nolan? Directors are often criticised for style-over-substance and in a weird way Nolan's films suffer the opposite - he's so committed to delivering his convoluted plots, twists and big reveals that he forgets about all the other elements that make a film work. 'The Prestige' is an exceptionally boring, long film populated by dull, unlikeable characters. I don't mind Christian Bale but he was really poor in this, not at all helped by the textbook cockney accent which, whilst good for an (unintentional) laugh at times, really grated on me and felt so disconnected to the character he was portraying. It was as if someone had dubbed a Bob Hoskins voiceover on his parts. Hugh Jackman should stick to action/comic-book films, he's not great at drama and has about three facial expressions. Scarlet Johansson is the same. Her attempt at an English accent rivalled Christian Bale's character for cringe factor. She kept oscillating between Received Pronunciation and Cockney, and occasionally slipped back into American English. The dialect coach must of been tearing their hair out. There was just so much bad acting and unrealistic dialogue in this film that I found it difficult to care about the characters or what was going on. In the scene where Hugh Jackman got shot and then conveniently delivered a load of exposition just before dying was straight out of the Cartoon Villain Death Scene Handbook™. I swear I was covering my mouth to contain the laughter. Just ridiculous. Anyway like most of Christopher Nolan's films the ending draws you back in and did elicit a bit of intrigue but I was so far gone by that point I just didn't care enough.

Multiple mean-spirited characters doing nasty things to one another for over two hours does not constitute a good story. The only message I could possibly see here was that mean poor people should triumph over mean rich people. There was not one character that I felt any sympathy or empathy for by the end of the film. They all double crossed each other and sold each other out repeatedly. On top of that, the film makers double crossed the audience, by strategically leaving things out only to reveal the true facts of various interactions later on just to fool the viewer. How could anyone walk away from this feeling even okay, much less good, about the film? The high rating it is getting is an absolute amazement to me. The trend in films now seems to be if you can have enough screwy twists to keep the audience thinking about the twists, character development, moral lessons, decent plots and story lines don't need to exist. This really took off with ""The Sixth Sense"" (which was actually a pretty decent movie)and continues to be the trend.

The Prestige deserves to be right up there with those classics. I love magic and films about them, and I was not disappointed in this one. The King of Masks is my favorite all time magic film. This film comes close; the performances are impeccable, the direction is on the nose, and the production values are first-rate. The screenplay is erudite, and should be appreciated by the intelligent viewer. The really great magician in this film is neither of the leading actors, however. It is Tesla, one of the greatest scientific minds of all time; hounded by the heinous Thomas Edison, a person we were taught to revere in school. It is only now, in the information age, that we have found out what a despicable person Edison really was. There is no relation to reality and the Spencer Tracy film about Edison. He was a criminal. But the film is about magic, not criminal acts, or even Tesla (although we surely could use a good film about him).

Caine fares better, although he seems to be still playing Batman's butler. Johansson is wasted in a negligible role.

But this is my conservative approach. Actually its among the all the time. The story was not a story. It was reflection of different human natures shown flawlessly through competition between two magicians - played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. The movie has several twists backed by logical sense that kept the interest alive for 2 hour length. The ending blew me away. I was shocked when secret of Christian Bale revealed in the end. On the technical side, art direction and camera work was stand out. Locations were so real, one could actually feel. On side role, Scarlett Johansson confidently played Magician's helper. She is hauntingly beautiful. Her little presence was noticeable.",

But I did understand that it went back and forth in time and I understood most of what happened, I'm just not sure if it was compelling enough to really care about what happens during the whole thing. Now Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine were fine as were Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie in a small role. Maybe if I were to watch again with a more alert eye I'd give this one a better rating but for now I'm giving this one a 5.",

I really like the thought of the ""its all about the sacrifices you make"" plot but it just doesn't last. Up until Nikola Tesla did his cloning/teleport thingey I still had some hopes for the movie and I sat hoping that Tesla had faked the cloning just to get some more money when i saw the hats and cats on the ground. I genuinely hoped the filmmakers illustrated Tesla as a hoax, it sure seemed better than the movie getting all Star Trek!

I didn't care what happened to any of them. I was hoping the third act would at least be exciting. But it was just more nonsense and it ends with a total anticlimax. One of the most nonsensical things in the film is that it never explains why the two protagonists are obsessed with doing harm to one another. What is even more nonsensical is that while these two men are extremely intelligent and know each other very well, they never take necessary precautions to prevent the other from subverting them. It's laughable. At the end you are just glad you don't have to endure any more nonsense. I don't know how I endured watching this film. Positive reviews here are by people who are content to watch utter nonsense if it is well shot and has magic tricks thrown in. One thing I did like was Bowie as the genius Tesla.

When I first saw Nolan's fifth feature (and his second working with his brother and occasional writing partner Jonathan), its 'big reveal' seemed obvious to me early on in the third act, so when the grand revelations came at the climax, I was left feeling somewhat underwhelmed. In the years since, The Prestige has emerged as a firm favourite amongst Nolanites, so I was eager to re-visit it without the added pressure of trying to navigate through the film's many smokes and mirrors. Without this on my back, I could only sit back and admire a true craftsman at work, even though the narrative pushes the boundaries of credibility.",

The pledge: setting up something that seems ordinary (a bird), the turn: making that thing do something extraordinary (the bird disappears), and the prestige: restoring that thing to reality (the bird reappears). The final of the three, which is meant to be the hardest to achieve, is the key to the trick working. It's eerie then that the film collapses within the most crucial area. Its own prestige. ",

My favorite part was when Robert does this amazing trick that is really hard to explain unless you've seen the movie. But, they used a person that looks just like him(even though it was really him)I expected it to be kind of boring but it didn't bore me one bit. I was interested in the movie from the beginning.

382,1 January 2007,vasco_cid,10, A Truly Intelligent and Gripping Piece of Art,"Over these last few years, I have been increasingly against the critics opinions on the quality of movies, whether it is on their criticism of blockbusters and lack of originality, or studio's greed for money on detriment of quality. These past year, i have to start to agree with them. That was until the Prestige came on. It has been a really long time since I have seen a movie that truly made me care about the characters and their motivations, and most importantly it has been a really long time since I have seen a movie that made me totally forget about the hectic life outside, and make me devout myself entirely without looking at my watch at least once. Obviously that isn't a coincidence, this only happens when true cinematic geniuses are behind the camera, either Christopher Nolan's passionate and intelligent direction and skillful writing adaptation capabilities, or Pfister's lighting and Julyan's score. That combined with a top-notch cast leading this peace of cinematic brilliance presented as a magic trick itself makes it a as enjoyable as possible. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman battle themselves character and acting-wise, because you never know which one has the advantage over the other, and to make the recipe perfect Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and David Bowie support the duo not over shadowing them but composing a colorful and deep canvas. I guess what I like the most about the Prestige is the fact that the movie is about magicians composing magic tricks and the three steps to complete them; and the movie is actually presented to us audience in that way: You have The Pledge (Who the characters are, their motives and backgrounds), The Turn (you realize nothing is what it seems, twists keep on coming and you never know who has leverage) and The Prestige (the most interesting of them all, because you are given an explanation for the events, which explains all of its ""cientific impossibilities"") But are they really impossible. Were all the explanations given to you the reality?.....Did you watch it closely? Make sure you did. Because the explanation is not what it seems. That is the real Prestige of ""The Prestige"".",

387,21 October 2006,nived84,10, Nolan delivers more than just smoke and mirrors,"It's now official in my book; Christopher Nolan is the Hitchcock of the twenty-first century. His films are often dark, psychological and mysterious and always intelligent and carefully planned out; he's a real pro of both direction and misdirection. From his early film, Following, to last summer's blockbuster hit, Batman Begins, his films also usually require some intelligence and maybe even a second viewing to put all the jig-saw piece together. His latest thriller, entitled The Prestige, is a combination of the gloomy cinematography of Batman Begins and the swift and often disorienting editing of Following. Yes, it's a thinker, and yes I'm sure some will easily confuse this film with The Illusionist, but these two films couldn't be anymore different. Where as The Illusionist was a romantic-mystery set in Vienna, The Prestige is a dark mystery-thriller set in Victorian era London. This is a darker, meaner and a much more emotionally colder film about two men's obsession with fame and greatness, and to what lengths they will desperately go to get it.",

A prefabricated universe dominated by figures with no soul and lungs: his audience likes the excitement of drowning their little imagination again and again; for them, films have to be that deadening and useless - and once they have watched them, they might say 'that was really good' a great many time before they get reanimated - lol! that is all right, because their understanding is so nimble to realize their error, which will be forgotten much more quickly than a dream.",

It's a lie: man's grasp exceeds his nerve."" 🎩","What might audiences find when peeking behind the curtain on this vaudeville act? A tense period piece, maybe a transcontinental thriller or perhaps a meditation on movie magic? This dense turn-of-the-century tale is all of those and more, proving Christopher Nolan to be a Hollywood heavy-hitter way back in 2006, and captivating audiences with its spell-binding and complex method for nearly two decades. Assembling his A-team of now-celebrated collaborators for this study on stage sleight-of-hand, such as cinematographer Wally Pfister and production designer Nathan Crowley, the British director is in true command of his craft for the film's somewhat-bloated 130 minutes, at times confounding and confusing viewers due in no small part to its marquee misdirection and sluggish pace. Leading lads Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale steal the show in dual roles as duelling magicians across three acts, daring audiences to sympathise with each protagonist as they pursue Faustian-like pacts with deadly consequences. Michael Caine and David Bowie are deserving of much praise, but sadly Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson find their talents wasted in under-written roles, did someone say dead wife trope? One-upmanship, pride and obsession are the name of the game during the pledge, turn and eponymous prestige, but the film flounders as it covers far too much thematic territory for its own good, and refuses to settle for any singular focus. Peeling back its layers reveals a fractal filmmaking style, trademark elliptical editing and marvellous use of mise en abyme, all of which would be improved in later Nolan features, yet this experience does demand your attention and encourage repeat viewings where keen eyes hope to spot every trick.

Both Bale and Jackman played their parts quite well, but the flip-flopping of scenes between past and present were ambiguous at best and nearly every twist was foreseeable (if not obvious) long before it was discovered by the characters. For a movie about two magicians I would've expected the ending to reveal a secret I wasn't anticipating the entire second half, which for obvious reasons made the last hour drag on waiting for the inevitable. In short, wait for the DVD. It certainly isn't worth paying $10 at the theater, for the acting is decent but not outstanding, the magic marginal, and the eventual revealing fairly obvious.

And that's okay. Movie goers accept premises and then follow the action without any need to examine the premise further. However I think that director Christopher Nolan might have looked more closely at the consequences of his premise. Replicating objects with electricity (pretty far-fetched of course) and moving them some distance from the replicating point is quite a feat even in the imagination.

He's now four for four, following up the solid efforts of ""Following,"" ""Memento"" and ""Batman Begins"" with the equally fantastic ""The Prestige."" When's the last time a writer or director managed four consecutive films under their belt that were each fiercely distinctive and creatively successful? Nolan added further insult to the incompetent and lazy of Hollywood by actually improving upon the source novel. The eye-rolling one experienced while reading Christopher Priest's prose became gasps while watching Nolan's skilled adaptation. Nolan not only ""fixed"" Priest's novel, but turned it up to 11, conceptually. Good direction and especially good writing are invisible -- people expect a competent job. Only the truly great and truly terrible stick out. Nolan's accomplished something truly great on both levels. Superb actors (especially one bit of stunt-casting comes as a wonderful surprise; usually these types of cameos detract from a picture but Nolan's steady hand delivered), lush production design and careful attention to the thematic bedrock make for a contemporary classic. The only shortcoming, which is minor, might be the show's abrupt cutting around during the first act, which could seem a bit confusing. The unique layered non-linear continuity (diary-within-diary-within-story, etc) works flawlessly when Nolan's taking his time. Keep the film's curious first image in mind while the narrative untangles and keep your mind open when things turn toward steampunk. And you fanboys who were miffed because Nolan ""wasted time"" on this feature between Batman blockbusters should rejoice. The guy has more than enough juice for the Dark Knight.",

I love the plot's perfect, crystalline construction. I love the counter-intuitive way it gains in power with each re-watch. First time around you tend to assume that now you know what's really going on, there's no point in revisiting. Instead you discover that watching it with an awareness of all this, of what's truly at stake, elevates the film from an intriguing mystery to a film of genuine emotional and thematic power. We're left increasingly gripped and increasingly uneasy each time; maybe, as we gain understanding, we could call it a horror film of sorts. Not one that scares conventionally, but that certainly leaves us with increasingly chilling reflections on humanity - but all whilst being endlessly gripped and entertained.",

I'm not quite sure why such talent agreed to be in this film after reading the script, unless they figured that most Americans are dolts and wouldn't realize how inane this movie actually is (which apparently is true).

The story is disjointed and confusing in that it keeps jumping back and forth in time so much that you lose the time line, and it all gets muddled. You're not sure what is taking place when. The dialogue is lacking and the direction is not nearly as inspired as I'd hoped. Christian Bale is more effective playing Americans than Brits somehow, and his Cockney accent is not very convincing. Jackman is underwhelming. The major secret of the film is so absurd and deflating that I felt cheated as the credits popped up.

What begins as a friendship, then becomes a competition, eventually turns into a maddening and psychotic race to defeat another person and to destroy the other person's entire existence. In doing so, it dehumanizes everyone involved, and is frightening in terms of what it says about our inability to contain our pain.

The movie plays like a magicians' version of ""The Duellists"", with Jackman and Bale vying to pull off the perfect disappearing act on the Edwardian stage. To make such a thin premise the basis for a whole movie takes some doing and it's to Nolan's credit that he pretty much pulls it off. I did find the constant change of narrative perspective somewhat confusing and the ""reveal"" at the end far fetched to say the least (unless I'm wrong Bale's disappearing device is actually a duplicating or cloning machine, with the doppelganger dying every night) but the journey along the way is well purveyed, helped by a stellar cast on good form. Michael Caine as elder statesman and lead narrator holds the story together, the stunts are effectively conveyed and throughout the dark cinematography holds your attention. As I stated above though, the implausibility of the piece ultimately detracts from the end result. Derren Brown does it better on TV!",

447,21 August 2021,dilipbts,10, The Prestige,"I've said it before, but I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan can do no wrong. Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and Michael Caine, and joined with the Scoop team consisting of X-Men's Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson, the stellar (eye candy) cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they'll be able to live up to the hype of Nolan's long awaited movie directly challenging the other picture about Victorian magicians, The Illusionist. The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick, with the first and second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out, it's like a huge magic trick, with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds, getting the suspicion on how it's done, but yet sitting through it thorough engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It tells the story of how two magicians, fellow apprentices turned unfortunate rivals, plod down the slow path of jealous obsession, revenge, and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each other's ideas, to go one up against the other, a fight in romance, life and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are perfect explanations of the value of secrets, and how secrets can sometimes be used as tools for deceit. What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the notion of how ""magic"" actually worked. Besides the better understanding of the common body of scientific knowledge, things like having pretty assistants to distract, and having planted staff amongst the audience, somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions, and try harder to spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More importantly, it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely for the magician's use, and how having disloyal staff can indeed be detrimental to any leaks of secrets. And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter, responsible for assisting Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) with loyalty and conviction that they could, as a team, beat Christian Bale's Alfred Borden. I thought the cast in general were superb, with Christian Bale leading the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark character, as the two leads tackled their characters' theme of sacrifice, arrogance, and ultimately redemption, especially for Rupert Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of penance to what happened in the beginning, hoping to kill two birds with a single stone, to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that there is no right or wrong, no hero or villain. It's always a shade of grey in what they do, and for Alfred Borden, I felt it's more for survival and the provision for family, which is a strong subplot running through the film. I just have to mention though, that Scarlett Johansson being Esquire's Sexiest Woman Alive, gets to play a flower vase role here as a magician's assistant, though her role as the pawn between the rivals added a little gravitas. The atmosphere was set up great, and so were the costumes and sets. The soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing, capturing the look and mood appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie's appearance as a Serbian scientist! I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to use placeholders, or flashback sequences, colours etc, here, time is so fluid, but yet the audience will know precisely which era they're in, without being explicitly told, or working too much of the noodle. You just know, and it's just that feeling of being totally transparent with time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours, you don't feel its length at all. At the end of the movie, one quote popped into mind: Misdirection - what the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Quite apt to describe how things work out during the movie, or to describe in general, Nolan 's films so far. That added richness to lift the movie to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour, if there's one movie you absolutely must watch this week, then Prestige must be your natural choice. It's smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none other. P. S. Is it just me, or are notebooks a common feature in Nolan's movies?",

Of cause we've got to give credits to Christopher Priest who came up with a great story and Nolan's brother Jonathan for helping hem. So it's about a... I don't know... a war I guess between two magicians. One is more of a showman and the other is obsessed with tricks. Well don't get me wrong they both obsessed but Christian Bales character is really obsessed. So for the most part the story runs in London in 19 century. Oh yeah good old London. And it's great because the city is beautiful. So the plot is incredible. I know you've heared it a lot but there are twists after twists. And when you think that there possibly can't be more they give you more. So that's that. The acting is great again as always in Nolan's film. He knows who to hire. I liked Bale and Caine the most.

I hesitate to employ the phrase 'rip-off' but no one writes in a vacuum and the similarities between the novel and the film are akin to those that would obtain at a convention of Siamese Twins. Both are 'period' works, Carter is set roughly eighty years ago, Prestige roughly one hundred; both revolve around rival magicians - or 'illusionists' - a rivalry so intense that even murder is countenanced; in both novel and film a magician loses a wife (in the film, as if anxious to avoid rip-off claims, each magician loses a wife, albeit the second one is a suicide). For that matter we could also be in David Mamet country, specifically the Mamet of The Spanish Prisoner.

""The Prestige"" is not nearly as challenging as ""Memento"" but is more intelligent than the average fare. You don't need a PHD to get it. Nolan has now made enough films that we can begin psychoanalyzing him. He seems to be attracted to stories that include obsession, revenge and deceit (self and otherwise.) All of these elements are crucial to the plots of ""The Prestige"", ""Memento"" and ""Batman Begins."" The ending is a bit ambiguous but this is the world of magic where nothing is apparent. It's hard to take sides in this film. There is ruthless conflict between Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale's characters but neither is completely the hero nor the villain.

One of the things I loved about this film was that it never felt like either Huge Jackman's or Christian Bale's character was more important than the other. Both of them are equally as interesting and well performed. The way Christopher Nolan doesn't tell the story in in a typical way and instead decided to jump back and forth from different parts in the story was a genius move. He did it in a way so that it was confusing but never too confusing, how he managed to do that is beyond me. It also never focused too much on the actually magic and was always about the rival between Huge Jackman and Christian Bale. All the performances are great as well. the only bad thing was Scarlett Johansson's British accent which was pretty awful.",

The audience is mesmerized by the magic acts, the romantic entanglements, but at the same time, is left utterly cold by the complete lack of warmth and humanity.

David Bowie played Nikola Tesla so well that I cant stop thinking of tesla with Bowies face since I have seen this ( a month ago).,
472,27 February 2021,judemcrobbie,10, Needs to be talked about more!,"Nolan has an incredible list of movies. Everyone knows about The Dark Knight (2008), Inception (2010) and Interstellar (2014) but it took a Nolan marathon to find this masterpiece.
The movie emanates the opening monologue; the first act being 'the pledge', promising that there is something interesting to come: the second act being 'the turn', making an ordinary whodunnit into a magical mystery: and finally the final and third act being 'the prestige', bringing back the idea in one of the best twists of a tale ever. The thing that sets this and fight club and the best plot twists is one the rewatch it can be seen but on the first time around you are none the wiser no movie does this better than the prestige as it just shows it the whole way through so subtly.
One of the best 2 handers in my opinion as both of the protagonists are equally the others antagonist making a brilliantly compelling story.
It has 2 of the greatest actors of this generation, and probably the best actress. Christian Bale is sublime as per, managing to show the multiple sides of his personality, to the point where you can guess when he is saying it (If you've seen it then you know, if not I don't want to spoil it) just from line delivery itself. Hugh Jackman is masterful in showing his discontent towards his counterpart and his professional quest to be the best. Scarlett Johanson brings an uncanny ability to create a sense of two faced-ness the characters requires. Top it with amazing supporting performances from the great Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, David Bowie, Piper Perabo and Andy Serkis. And both Bale and Jackman play 2 roles each which is stunning. My only gripe with the acting is Scarlett Johansson's British accent. It's not very good in short.
This is probably Nolan's most drama-ry movie and least sci fi. He executes the mystery nature in a way that through the whole movie grips you making you want to know how to do it.
A complete story of twists and turns from the classic friends to enemy's movie
Must watch!",
473,14 November 2006,monk_e_fish,9, Magic movie,"Christopher Nolan is a director who seems preoccupied by the human mind and psychological troubles. Each of his dark, thriller type movies has focused on one such a thing, fear, insomnia, memory, stalking. As befits the subject matter, The Prestige is a slippery kind of film, full of disguise (the array of false beards used by the two central magicians is quite dazzling) twists and turns and revelations. Like his breakthrough masterpiece Memento, Nolan uses a non-linear time scheme to great effect in disguising where the plot is going and where it has come from. As in Memento, the time of the scene is shown through the character's physical scarrings (Leonard Shelby's facial scars here become Robert Angier's limp) that suggest an earlier mental scarring not yet revealed in the film. Drawing an obvious parallel with his own profession, performance is also a central theme of the film for Nolan. Hugh Jackman's Robert Angier (AKA The Great Danton) is a consummate performer, a showman who is able to pull in huge theatre crowds while rival Alfred Borden shies from the limelight and from dressing up his tricks and thus often finds himself playing to small rooms of people. Angier is driven by performance so much that even ""Robert Angier"" is as much of a persona as ""The Great Danton"". He needs the acclaim of his audience, this is what defines him as a character. Jackman's charisma as a leading man has never been in doubt since he strapped on the claws and sideburns of Wolverine and this charisma is perfectly used for his stage performances as Danton, expertly selling the tricks. Meanwhile, as the obsessive Angier, Jackman brings a great range from the pain and anger after the death of his wife to the dangerous obsession and desire to discover the secret to his rival's trick. Even despite the cruel and slightly mentally disturbed things that Angier does, Jackman maintains the audience's sympathy for the most part and this is to his great credit. In his second feature with Nolan, after the superb Batman Begins, Christian Bale delivers an equally impressive performance as Borden, an intense, brooding but brilliant man who is able to spot the secret to Angier's and others' tricks with ease while they cannot see his. Borden has a similarly obsessive dedication but it is to creating the perfect trick, he lives his life purely for this and not for the audience acclaim like Angier. This sets up an interesting dichotomy in the motivations of the character that is reflected in their later actions. Bale and Nolan do bring some lighter moments for the serious Borden in his happy relationship with his wife and child. Seeing Borden as a happy family man brings the sympathy back round to him. With such attention on the leads, the supporting cast have less to do. Scarlett Johansson's role does not extend far beyond looking amazing in the saucy magician's assistant costumes. Meanwhile, the presence of David Bowie as enigmatic electricity manipulator Tesla is more of a distraction than a strong piece of casting, despite Bowie's obvious cool factor. However, the venerable Michael Caine gives a great weight to the character of Cutter, Angier's mentor who creates the mechanics of his tricks and tries to persuade him from the path of obsession. Caine is the heart and soul of the film, its moral compass and it is another superb performance of warmth, dignity and regret that suggest the great man is only getting better with age. No film is quite perfect and one minor flaw comes with the fact that with performances this good, the script doesn't need to say some of the things that it does. Writing with his brother Jonathon again, as in Memento, Nolan here has a slight tendency to overuse voice-over through the device of the magicians reading each other's diaries. The diaries may be a strong literary device in the source novel but are less cinematic. With Jackman conveying so much emotion wordlessly simply in his below stage bows when he wishes to be above, in front of the audience, there is no need to have his diary tell us this is how he felt. However, in general, the Nolans construct a strong script that provides a good balance between the lead characters and has a great momentum towards its strange climax. The twist in this film is not one that completely pulls the rug out from under you, that nobody will see coming, as this is often quite a lazy way of ending a movie with no relation to what has come before. Instead, Nolan threads the film with subtle references to what is really happening so that the film rewards paying close attention. Like the best magic tricks, it is not the outcome that amazes, it is the execution of it and even if you guess what the outcome is to be, there are still a couple of surprises waiting for you. Visually, Nolan brings up a number of stylish, arresting images of duplication, repetition and duality and objects that seemed just visually interesting earlier in the film gain in significance as the film progresses. The opening shots of a huge number of top hats in a forest or the cages full of pairs of canaries are prime examples of this. They are at first just a nice image, later the objects gain a significance and finally, the symbolism of the image has implications for the themes of the movie. The Prestige is, simply, a true prestige picture. An expert piece of film-making on virtually every level. What is more, five films in, it confirms Brit Nolan's place as one of the finest directors of his generation.",

476,4 June 2007,shapiro88,5, great direction... awful ending,"The movie had a great set-up and very good direction and story telling... however the ending was completely awful. The duplication machine was beyond ridiclous for a movie with a serious tone. Its as if the writers, during the screenplay, ran out with ideas on how to end the movie and explain how ""The teleportation man"" trick actually works... so instead just decided to make a fantasy ending/ explanation. However, as with all christopher Nolan movies, the movie is paced very well with a lot of realistic twists and turns. the story telling (up until the last 10 minutes) is very good. However, the main problem is the two big twists. The teleportation machine was previously discussed. The other was the ridoclous plot twist of the twin brother. It is obivous the writers reached too much to create a magic trick they couldn't logically explain themselves so they created the twin, and added a sprinkle of hints throughout the movie to attempt to give crediablity to the awful ending",

The film cleverly uses its subject matter to create a mystery story; and as with all magic tricks, the question as to what is real remains open until the very end. There's even an inventive walk-on part for Nikolai Tesla, the real life creator of the alternating current. The film has weaknesses - in some ways, the two magicians are two similar, I wasn't enamoured of Christian Bale's performance, and perhaps at the end, more could have been made of the fundamental difference between true magic and a trick - the film explains (at least partly), but there's a certain lack of moral resonance.

485,2 November 2006,DickNay,8, The Most Original Movie In Recent Years,"Christopher Nolan's THE PRESTIGE is one of the most shockingly-original films I've ever seen; rather, the book of the same name by Christopher Priest is really the most original. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman seem ingeniously cast, with Bale as the inwardly-focused, pensive, quiet magician, and Jackman as his rival, a boastful, flashy showman. These characters also mirror the two actors' styles; Bale is more of a deeper character actor, and Jackman is, and always has been, very entertaining to watch, but his acting has always been like a bucket of buttery popcorn; it tastes good when you eat it, but you feel slightly sick after you eat it, and it has no nutritive value. Having said this, the two actors have never been better. The story is ultimately clever, albeit quite confusing at times. Much like the TV show ""Lost"", the pertinent, plot-heavy duologue is intentionally vague, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats. Just like a good magic trick - or a good Prestige, rather - the audience willingly immerses themselves in this twisting, creepy world; you WANT to be confused.

He must find out how it is done. He gets a new assistant that he falls for but sends her to Borden to discover the secret. However, she falls for Borden and this cause's Borden's wife to commit suicide. Angier goes to see a scientist and he invents a cloning box using electricity. This is where the supernatural elements come into play. Through a series of events, Borden is accused of Angier's murder and is sentenced to die. But, is Angier really dead? What about Borden? What was the secret to the Teleported Man? All of these questions are answered in a confusing ending, but the cloning part still doesn't make complete sense to me.",
489,6 November 2006,m_bong1,2, Mostly disappointing......,"This had a lot of potential and the same tricks as batman begins. The dreary landscapes and overt use of dull colors to make to movie more sombre than it actually is. If I didn't know better I would guess that Nolan had a gay affair with Christian bale. Bale needs to overcome his lisp( speech impediment) and his 1 dimensional acting. The plot is predictable and sometimes you are tricked to think that there could be more than the obvious, but that feeling is ephemeral. British accents are laughable and the premise of Tesla inventing duplicating machines is an challenging ones intelligence. The Nolans need to ease up on the toke and think of something less inane. I'm afraid that the people who were awed by this insipid movie need to increase their cognitive capabilities.",

I give you at first I kept thinking it was sort of like Batman versus Wolverine. This movie had the potential to be a great film but at best it was a mediocre attempt at a mysterious period piece. The two main characters were unsympathetic and the others were merely window dressings for their obsessions. I am not really all that much of a Caine fan but I can easily say that he did the best performance of these actors. Even though most of the acting was barely on par, the script and editing were far worse. The timing and movement of this piece took it from a passable film to dreadfully long one. The problem with its length is that it gives you so much time that you figured out all the twists and after that what's the point? I felt mislead with this film as well, it was far more of a revenge flick than a historical fiction. If you are interested in magicians and period pieces try the Illusionist. It was a much better constructed film.",

For those who do not know who Kayzer Soze is -- go watch The Usual Suspects. Since the release of that film there have been quite a lot of Hollywood releases that have tried to copy the formula from Usual Suspects. The problem is, however, 1) the formula is sucked dry by now, and 2) in order to amuse the audience, they need to feel respected and not be messed with. It's not the amount of plot twists that matters, it's the quality. The Usual Suspects had a single plot twist and it was a brilliant one. The Prestige has a whole bunch of twists, none of which are credible or intelligent. And, one must not forget (SPOILER ALERT), the only one dumb enough to use the twin brother concept as a cover-up for plot holes, is Jean-Claude van Damme. Oh, and I must admit, apart from the plot, the acting, cinematography and directing itself is pretty good.

The whole film is full of foreshadowings and tricks everywhere. At first, you are looking at the fog, but as the time of the film develops, suspense begins to be revealed one by one, and your ideas begin to slowly become clear. However, you still can't think of the biggest suspense. You only realized at the last moment of the film was suddenly bright, everything was clear, and the foreshadowings were buried so wonderfully. Ok without looking at other people's reviews, think about the foreshadowing of the final mystery revealed in the film:
1. When Borden stared to change the bird game, Sarah's little nephew saw that the two birds were not the same, and asked persistently: What about his brother? And Burden said: What Actress liu yifei's choice is too good!! I love it!! So happy!! Smart boy. He insinuated his brother here;
2. When Borden went to Sierra's house for the first time, Sierra said goodbye to Borden. When Sarah turned around to close the door, Borden was already in Sarah's room.
3. The foreshadowing of the rope. After Angier's wife died, Angier asked Borden: Which knot did you tie? Borden said: I don't know.
4. It's still a questionable of rope. Before his wife with Angier died, Cutter said to Borden: Why do you always make this kind of mistake every few days, and you will never be allowed to make it again( referring to the wrong knot );
5. Sarah asked: We can't afford him, I will divide my food in half, and I will share other things with him.
6. Then, when Sarah said she was pregnant, Borden's first reaction was: OMG we should tell Fren that we have a baby! Here we are actually referring to the two Borden brothers, not Borden and Sarah.
7. Borden failed to perform the bullet magic, and Sarah bandage him the wound. Borden's wound was strange. There was no bleeding, but then he bleeded again.
8. When Borden said to Sarah everyday that I love you, Sarah said: I think you sometimes say it's true, sometimes it's false.
9. Borden's daughter told Borden that you promised me to go to the zoo today, and Borden froze for a moment: Have I said that? Oh, maybe . Maybe not today, but tomorrow. Here again, he laid the groundwork for his two daily swales.
I have to say that the director is really good. In fact there are many other things in the film, such as : Angier's machine used a blind man as a servant, Angel's instantaneous movement has a hidden door that falls down... etc..., so I will not list them one by one.",

509,4 February 2019,harryplinkett14,1, What a mess,"So many characters, so many plot twists, so many relationships, so many secrets and tricks... In the end, we are left feeling bored. This film was clearly designed as an allegory of a magic trick, but it lacks the punch line, or the so-called 'prestige'.
It is never quite clear who is in love with whom in this film, who is angry at whom and why, or why the characters do what they do. Are they just fanatical competitors, or is it all about revenge for what they did in private? You see, it is impossible to grasp the motivation of these characters, because frankly, most of the time their actions are either extremely childish or outright psychotic. Yet the characters are not portrayed as such, so when they act the way they act, one is not quite sure what they are doing.
Also, the script is not only needlessly convoluted, but it is also too lazy for a film that is all about clever tricks. These magicians go to such extreme lengths to fool others, yet the script makes them look dumb whenever it is convenient for the screenwriter. How can these masters of magic manage to never recognize one another, just because they are wearing a fake beard? How come they are fooled by a fake belly and a fake nose? How come they never anticipate the other might try and sabotage their act, and take necessary precautions? There are so many moments where these otherwise super cunning characters act like complete idiots. And that ruins the fun. But what really ruins it for me is that the ending reveals absolutely nothing of any interest, other than things everyone in the audience already knew at that point. Why were these two sabotaging and outdoing each other like this? Guess they were crazy after all. But that is not a satisfying ending.",

523,26 November 2006,hdervic,10, Nolan Delivers Another Fine Film.,"Christopher Nolan delivers another fine film with Christian Bale and Micheal Caine in tow, again. Like Batman Begins, the cinematography in The Prestige draws in the viewer whether the shot is a panoramic Rocky Mountain landscape or a squalid London slum. Nolan's sets are intrinsic to the story and make the unfolding drama all the more compelling. So much of the story is dependent upon the scenario in which a scene occurs. This is a period piece for the 21st century. The performances are very good to excellent by the entire cast. Christian Bale satisfies again with his nuanced role as a competitive illusionist. It is nice to see Hugh Jackman going for roles of substance given his strong acting ability. Micheal Caine, legendary, enough said. The women in the film are equally good. I was floored to learn that Ms. Perabo, who plays Bale's wife in the film, is a native of New Jersey. Her period London accent is flawless. Scarlett Johannsen develops nicely in this film and as long as she seeks dimensional characters like this, she can count on a long and rewarding career. Seeing Bowie on film is always a treat. His turn as Nikola Telsa is well suited to his repertoire. The story is well written and superbly directed. Anybody who writes a spoiler to this film is doing those who have not seen the film a disservice. I only hope Nolan can get the recognition he deserves when all the awards are given.",

Like ALL of the most ""INCREDIBLE"" magic tricks ever to be performed there is somewhat of a disappointing secret, but nonetheless if you can keep the audience from ever discovering this secret, they'll never be disappointed. A lot of reviewers will say, the tricks weren't that impressive as if the answer was so obvious but I can bet that until things were made REAL clear those review critics would have never guessed it either. There was no real spoiler in this comment, but if you go and watch the movie after reading what I said about there being a very simple answer to the ultimate trick, you should be able to figure it out even though you might doubt yourself at the beginning.

535,9 November 2006,teh_mode,8," Outstanding. Yet another in Christopher Nolan's increasingly heavy bag of tricks that'll leave you begging the question ""How does he do it?""","Obsession, a theme dealt with countless times before, is never one that grows old in narrative cinema. We see it manifest itself in almost every genre, from epic crime sagas like Michael Mann's Heat (1995) to anti-eroticism like David Cronenberg's Crash (1996), such is its generic influence. The Prestige, the latest from wunderkid Christopher Nolan, is a movie very much rooted in obsession, but more importantly how in-human people are willing to go in order to feed there obsession. Hugh Jackman plays Robert Angier, a wannabe-magician, and brilliant showman whose trickster talents are sadly lacking the amazement that Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) enriches his magic with. Borden, meanwhile, lacks the showmanship of Angier, and can only sell his act for its amazement, in spite of its wizardry. Beginning their careers as apprentices, both Angier and Borden work with each other at first, but as is established early on in Nolan's film, their friendship turns to rivalry, and inevitably in death, as the non-linear narrative establishes early on that Borden has been charged with the murder of Angier's character, and sentenced to a jail cell. Yet not is all as it seems, as the twisted nature of the plot keeps the audience firmly on their toes throughout the proceedings.",

Nothing interesting happens, it's a story so convoluted  and stupid written only to get to the last ""shocking reveal"" that  ANYONE with half a brain would expect coming since the introduction  Caine gives about a magic trick. I wonder just how can Hollywood  believe that people are still impressed or interested in this ""usual  suspect"" trickery: come up with something else already, we don't need  to be ""fooled"", we can take a good narrative that doesn't try to  outsmart us (specially when it doesn't like in the Prestige).  And then that reveal is even dumber than you could ever imagine, not  that you wouldn't see it coming at least 30 minutes ahead, it's just  that you would hope that it's not THAT stupid and that the  writer/director would respect the audience and give something credible  or at least smart. No luck with that.  Anybody that loves movies should stay away from this crap, I'm just  glad I didn't pay to see it, but I'm sad about wasting a couple of  hours of my time with it.

542,8 February 2008,Forever_21,9, Brilliantly conceived and executed,The Prestige is a tale of bitter revenge between two rival magicians during the end of the 19th century. The film is set largely in a bleak London which helps to portray the true grubby nature of the obsessions that begin to envelop the two young magicians played magnificently by Hugh Jackman (Angier) and Christian Bale (Borden).,
543,11 November 2006,eastbergholt2002,7, Enjoyable but Far-fetched,The Prestige is directed by Christopher Nolan and takes place in late Victorian London. The movie is enjoyable but just a little disappointing given the ecstatic reviews. Hugh Jackman (Robert Angier) and Christian Bale (Alfred Borden) play two competing magicians who start out as colleagues and end up as deadly rivals. It's set at a time when stage magicians were well paid and treated like rock stars. Angier is a smooth and polished American with considerable stage presence. Bale is a driven blue-collar type with brilliant and original ideas. Both become obsessed with their rivalry. Jackman enlists the help of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) to develop the ultimate magic trick. Unfortunately the results are unbelievable and spoil the movie.,

When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.",
545,15 January 2007,Coventry,6, LOVED the trick with the canary!,"Performing magic shows is literally a 'tricky' business. Unquestionably these magicians are good artists, as they have to disguise a presumably very simple and logical trick and build a whole show around it, but at the same time the whole concept quickly tends to get boring. Just because you automatically presume there's a simple explanation for every illusion, you risk losing interest and I was more or less worrying that the movie would suffer from this exact same problem. It isn't very interesting to hear Michael Caine enlightening us about the different phases of a successful trick and it's even less interesting to constantly hear about two beginning magicians wanting to become the biggest performers of their time. Personally, I wasn't really hoping for a thriller revealing a lot of magic-secrets. I was merely anticipating a dark & sinister post-Gothic portrait revolving personal vendettas and macabre set pieces. And for the largest part, The Prestige actually delivers! The man in the director's chair is Christopher Nolan, and both ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia"" already proved he's a terrific storyteller, as he has the talent to bring an ordinary tale much more complex than it actually is. Nolan once again uses as irregular narrative structure, with jumps back and forward into time and well-camouflaged hints that eventually all lead to a gigantically grotesque denouement. Robert Angier (Hugh ""Wolverine"" Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian ""Batman Begins"" Bale) are two gifted pupils of the already legendary 'engineer' Cutter (Michael Caine), both treasuring the ambition to become the nation's biggest magician. A regretful accident, resulting in Angier's wife tragic death on stage, causes their friendship to turn into intense competition and pretty soon they spend even more time sabotaging each other's shows than actually building up their own acts. When Alfred Borden eventually presents his perplexing Transported Man trick and Angier can't possibly decipher the logic behind it, the rivalry turns into a dangerous obsession that will require large sacrifices. The main attraction of this film is probably meant to be the guessing along for the tricks and the detailed exposition of a handful of basic magical acts, but honestly that whole aspect impressed me the least. With just a tad bit of concentration and the experience of having seen similar mystery-thrillers, the red herrings are fairly transparent. Also, the whole set-up of Robert Angiers ultimate act (with the help of pop star David Bowie in a remarkable role) is simply impossible to take serious. Whatever remains, however, is definitely worth watching. The mysterious late 19th Century set pieces are intriguing, especially the transporting machinery which seems to be inspired by the ""telepods"" in David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"". The detailed illustration of magical tricks didn't really fascinate me, although there's one notable exception: the disappearing canary! It's a cruel and pretty offensive old-school trick, but hilarious in case you have a weird sense of humor. Quite embarrassing, because I was the ONLY person in a sold-out theater who was laughing with this sequence. The acting performances are top-notch, but with an ensemble cast like this we wouldn't accept it any other way. Particularly Christian Bale is terrific, since his naturally mysterious charisma is ideal for a role as a magician. Scarlett Johansson's part is rather small, but her beautiful appearance helps cheering up the dark sets a lot.",

560,8 June 2007,mcsheehey,8, Truly Magical,"""The Prestige"" was box office magic, and for good reason. The film chronicles the brutal rivalry between two former friends, Angier (Hugh Jackamn) and Borden (Christian Bale). The story is set in 19th century Britain, and is a tale of magic, betrayal, greed, and trickery. So as not to spoil the plot, I'll focus on the acting and visuals, mostly. Angier is the more likable magician of the two rivals, and this is mainly due to the superb portrayal of him by Hugh Jackman. Jackman is not over-the-top, yet possesses an unwritten magic about him in this film. He turns in stellar work in a more restrained part than usual. Bale is effective and very good as Borden, but I found his character cruel and annoying. Still, he, like Jackamn, does very well with the proper accent.

This story may be sci-fi, however, the issues that we could relate to, is astonishingly in abundance. Take the core of the movie - competition of magicians. It is a reality that you must have the better trick to lure more customers. In this phase of competition, it is called healthy competition. As time passes, you move onto the next phase - resent. This is the phase where you begin to figure ideas to eliminate the competitor. Then comes the final phase - obsession. From healthy to obsessed. Obsession is the phase where you go beyond competitive elimination - which is now dangerous and life-threatening. Just like the 3 stages of magic which was the theme of the movie - The Pledge, The Turn, The Prestige. These issues, although depicted in a sci-fi way, is very true in reality. Humans compete for business. Humans begin to try damaging other people's business. Humans begin to assassinate other people so they could have their turf for their business. We live in a very twisted world, and this movie is no different.",

Unfortunately, the key plot device is predictable from half-way through at the latest. But then, Wally Pfister's masterful cinematography is compelling all by itself. Also, perhaps one shouldn't complain when a movie gives you David Bowie as Nicola Tesla. The script sure strikes the chord of truth when it calls him ""not a magician, but a real wizard"". In my book, that's as accurate a description of Tesla as it is of Bowie. From what I've seen of the Nolan brothers' work, I wish they stuck to their own screenplays like they did in ""Memento"".

If you watch the movie and don't get what I mean, just try to put yourself in the place of the magician going into his machine. Now decide which one you would be...and then, what comes next? The reason I say that you must watch it at least twice is that there are a set of events during the story where it becomes apparent that you have to work out which character was actually involved. The first viewing doesn't prepare you for the need to do that. Since I was passively watching the story the first time around, I didn't notice what was actually happening but I was uncomfortably confused from time to time. It is only with repeated viewings that you move towards a better understanding.

I'm too lazy to complain of how stupid it is. But in short in real life ending would have not worked at all. 4. Also how was Bale sentenced for murder if Hugh Jackman (the one he murdered) kept doing his shows and also how nobody ever found those dead bodies anywhere? You can't just simply hide hundreds of dead clones without anyone noticing even if he paid someone to hide them, I believe he would've been betrayed as getting hands on cloning machine is much more valuable than money and also you could make much more money from it anyway.

Bale portrays a magician who ends up in a serious and life threatening rivalry with another magician, played by Hugh Jackman. Now that wasn't a particularly compelling description but I really don't want to ruin anything for you. Hugh Jackman actually delivers an uncharacteristically good performance in this movie, he easily matched Bale. It really was perfect casting.

Nolan goes back to the mystery / suspense genre with this tale of two rival magicians (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) who compete with each other, sometimes viciously. The film lives on its twists and turns, so it's not a good idea to spoil any of the plot. I thought the movie was pretty entertaining. It's always fun, and I always was eager to see what came next. The twists and secrets are generally pretty good, though one of the story's biggest secrets becomes painfully obvious too early on. I think most of the audience will begin to recognize Nolan's very obvious attempt at sleight of hand whenever a particular character's face is on camera for more than a handful of frames. That doesn't harm the entertainment value too much. What I would have liked, and what I think would have made the film much more memorable, is a bit more emotional involvement. The characters are universally two-dimensional here. They're all just a cipher for the plot. The movie had absolutely no thematic complexity, either. Neither one of these things that it lacks is particularly far from its grasp. And without complex characters or themes, the film is just a ""Wow, this is cool!"" rather than a ""What is it that I just experienced?"" I know that, to so many in the IMDb community, that's the same thing, but it really isn't. I do think Nolan succeeded at finding depth with Memento, but he certainly hasn't here. Still, I'm satisfied with it just being a cool popcorn movie.",

It cryptically tells you its many twists in its opening moments yet still manages to surprise with them. Yet, beyond the twists and turns lies a layered narrative centred around two well-crafted characters, one that impacts emotionally as well as intellectually. It is often forgotten amidst the plethora of Nolan's other work, but it sits just as highly as them and is, in my book, even a little underrated. 8/10",

In 2000 he amazed the viewing audience with his wonderful Momento and...trust me...this is equally as good if not better! Christian Bale shows us once more that his Reign of Fire days are well and truly behind him as he puts in a dazzling performance as the moody and slightly arrogant Alfred Borden, who triggers a series of hate fuelled events when his hunger to make tricks seem more dangerous causes the death of his colleague's wife. His former colleague, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), then sets out to destroy not only Borden's career but his whole life along with it. The pair are quickly caught up in a 'punch-for-punch' type battle which, it soon becomes very clear, will not have a happy ending. Also, credit to Michael Caine for his calming performance of Cutter who seeks to help Angier succeed but yet at the same time shows, by contrast to himself, just how enraged both characters of Borden and Angier are becoming in the battle.",

Kudos to everyone involved but the three big names are these of Caine, Bale and Jackman (in that order). Phenomenaly presented witty screenplay, with unexpected twists and some really fresh humour.

626,21 July 2019,Dello_,7, Only perfectly crafted,"""The Prestige"" is an excellent movie from the technical standpoint (except for his score, but I will refer to this later): Bale and Jackman in particular gave a great performance and Nolan is really good as usual. The film is interesting mostly because of the intricated structure of his plot, where the Nolan brothers have fun in crossing the flow of time over and in changing constantly who to root for.
But unfortunately I have to say that it has, in my opinion, poor emotional weight. ""The Prestige"" is listed as a thriller but I didn't feel the suspense, except for two scenes. And also his ambiguous nature about the protagonist doesn't help, because the real protagonist is the fight that I didn't find that exciting. But for this issue the worst thing is the score. It isn't bad at all, but it isn't nothing. I hardly remember a point in a film where it played and I am almost convinced that the movie was scoreless. For someone it may not be an issue but I think a score is useful when it enters your brain and enriches the scene, not when it is hardly listened.

637,13 August 2011,sammyfatkitty,9, The Prestige Review,"The Prestige is a brilliant story of revenge, jealousy, and obsession between two 19th century magicians. This movie really works because of the good performances, great direction from Christopher Nolan, and a story that keeps you guessing. Alfred Boden (Christian Bale), and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), start off as two magicians aides that are quite good friends. But after a series of unforgivable events, the two becomes enemies constantly trying to one-up each others work. This is when the story becomes a gripping revenge and obsession thriller, with each magician vying to create the perfect illusion. Jackman gives one of the best performances of his career as the emotionally tormented and obsessed Angier, a man who loses everything in order to create the ultimate trick that not even Boden can top. Bale gives a good enough performance, but he does come off as a smug jerk of a character throughout the majority of the film. The good acting as well as the intense direction really keeps you on the edge of your seat, and leaves you just as perplexed and frustrated as the magicians in terms of finding out how these illusions are performed. One thing I was worried about with this movie was that after going through many twists and turns, it wouldn't all tie together in a conceivable way. Once the movie reached its climax, however, the whole thing made complete sense and came together in a very nicely. Overall, this is a great obsession story that really makes you think, and also features good acting and near perfect direction. A definite must-see, especially for Christopher Nolan fans.",

When you reach the final twist you may think the experience is over, but the greater implications of his character's actions are exactly what make this one of Nolan's best films. Releasing a year after Batman Begins, Nolan pushes aside the blockbuster superhero shtick for a self-reflective film about obsession and love for one's craft. The themes explored are limited and specific, and Nolan focuses on them with pin-point accuracy throughout the entire runtime. It is a confusing and devastating film which is ultimately about art, admiration, and how far someone is willing to go to achieve their goals.",

643,22 December 2021,charbelelaro,10, I really don't have a single criticism with The Prestige,"The Prestige is directed by Christopher Nolan, and is a story centred around a rivalry between two magicians who so desperately need to create the ultimate illusion. However this obsession brings about dark and tragic consequences, causing both magicians to lose site of their humanity. This film is so under appreciated in my opinion, and that's merely due to the fact that I don't think people realise that a plot like this does not come around very often. Seriously, a realistic, dark and mysterious movie about magicians... am I the only person who thinks that's really cool? And the best part is, the movie actually delivers. Nolan doesn't just tell a story about magicians, he takes it one step further and structures the entire movie as if it were a magic trick. Hiding something in plain site, which by the twist has us questioning everything we just watched. Out of all of Nolan's films The Prestige has always seemed to intrigue me little more. The atmosphere created in 19th century London, is everything from sophisticated to eerie. The performances form Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are absolutely captivating. They both completely embody their character's and present such an intense rivalry, which had me forgetting it was fictional. The cinematography is also insanely beautiful, yet subtle. The camera work and lighting, really emphasises and dark and gritty nature of the movie, which immerses its audiences into the film even further. I really don't have a single criticism with The Prestige. On first viewing, the film did leave me feeling quite perplexed with how the ending added up to the rest of the film. That is why I highly recommend to see it again. On second viewing it is an entirely different film. Nolan's subtlety is genius. There is so much thought and detail sprinkled all over this film. I've seen it countless times now, and I still manage to find something new to appreciate. The Prestige is one of my all time favourite films.",

I truly felt this movie was a soon to be a favorite of mine.... then everything crashed! Something about how they played the whole ""it was twins all along thing"" just felt off. Not the fact that it turned out to be the ""secret"" to the magic trick, it was pretty obvious all along, but the way they did it. It kinda disrupted the flow of the story, as they played the revelation as something very unforeseen and shocking, but like I previously mentioned, it was glaringly obvious the whole time. But all in all, that would have been a fairly mild criticism for the film as a whole. That pales in comparison to the end. I watched speechless, as this smart and engaging movie turned into a goofy sci/fi. A machine that duplicates objects and people?? Designed by Tesla?? An underground room where they stored and killed the human duplicates that were made from the machine for the ""magic trick""?? Are you kidding me? Are you serious!? They say you want to shock your audiences with your endings, I certainly was shocked! But but not in a good way!

The film focuses on the theme of obsession, and it just plays out wonderfully, with us getting to see the layers and layers of these two characters' minds.

The movie and reviewers say watch carefully, and, watch the movie again, to see what the tricks/illusions are and try to figure out how they are done. There is just one big fat problem with all that. You can't see anything. The director, cinematographer, and lighting guy are of the silly conceit that period movies should be heard but not seen. The lighting guy analogized to Hitchcock, but there is just one problem with that. With Hitchcock, you might not be able to understand exactly what was going on, you might not be able to figure out what was going on, but you could always see what was going on. I don't understand. The budget for this thing was $40 mill. and they decided to keep people from seeing what they spent their money on. It might have been a decent movie, but it is so dark, you can't see anything, so, what was the point in making the movie. There certainly isn't much point in trying to watch it. Let's face it, a dark black screen isn't that exciting and doesn't hold viewer interest. The big Prestige at the end? You can't see what leads up to it so it doesn't shock, surprise, or matter. 8.5?

It's brings out to the world of the magicians of the turn of the century. The story itself of two warring magicians does have its charms, as both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackson were great in their respectable roles, playing the two rivaling magicians searching for that one jaw dropping trick to out shine the other. The two begin as friends, but when tragedy happens when a trick gone wrong, setting up for their lifelong battle to out shine the other begins. The charm and the magic of the film is painted gray as director Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins) brings a very dark and suspenseful look to Victorian London. The two leading stars followed up with Michael Caine, whom good in his role as a mentor type trying to inference and make peace between the two warring factions, but yet making it worst. Scarlett Johansson character is inter-twisted with both leads, but the acting from her wasn't much. David Bowie is nearly forgotten in his role as Nikola Tesla but yet his character is one that puts 'The Prestige' from Victorian historic melodrama to more Verne Steam punk Sci-fiction. He doesn't come into the film, until ¾ in. His role isn't large enough, nor long enough on film, but his character and his invention serves as the final twist in the story. The film is filmed & edited in a way throughout that feels as if it is concealing its hand in just for the final reveal. Unfortunately the reveal isn't as satisfying as it could have been, with half of it being a slyly admirable in its innocence & the other half simply jarring with the films tone & genre. It wasn't much to add it, as it was clearly out there before the final reveal. Is it worthy of the high marks? Not really--- it's works as suspense, thriller, but is it watchable after once--- sadly not. The film barely shows any other mood—then dark emotion that to the point, can serve to be somewhat depressing to watch. It's clearly not the film to watch at a party, or a get together. For a movie, it's really demand it's viewers to pay attention to every fact. It's hard to explain based on only viewing. The film is great, but it's semi overrated due to the popularity of Nolan. Watching the movie would do no favor if not watching it on BLU-RAY. It's one of the cleanest & sharpest BLU-RAY releases ever. It's a unique picture in this day & age for sure, & holds more showmanship & gloom than its counterpart 'The Illusionist', but the latter is a more satisfyingly (if only because it plays it safer) rounded film.",

671,28 July 2008,Hercooles1,10, Wizard of Oz is nothing compared to Christopher Nolan,"The prestige is about two rivaling magicians in London during the turn of the century. Nolan accomplished a unique, not to say magical movie. From the actors and their performances to the dialogs to the background music...everything is presented in a magical way. Every great movie consists of three acts. The first act is called The Pledge: The movie shows you something ordinary, but of course it isn't. The second act is called The Turn: The movie makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. Now, if you're looking for the secret you won't find it. That's why there's a third act, called The Prestige. This is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before. You have just seen The Prestige! :)",

There's always a new trick to master, metaphorical mountains to summit in the name of ultimate victory, and this duel of private obsession leaves no stone un-crushed. As they confound and confuse one another, so do they astonish and amaze the viewer; half the fun is in learning how each man achieves the impossible, then watching as their rival maliciously thwarts it before a paying audience.",

Mr. Tesla was responsible for the introduction of alternating current and knowing that will make the movie even more entertaining.

I was told about this movie from a friend of mine, and when he told me about it, I was really pessimistic about going to see it... Boy, was I wrong. I was expecting a movie that was long, boring, and just hard to watch... Take it from me, this movie is none of those three things. I definitely believe that this movie deserves its spot in the top 250. I even think it should be brought down into the low 100s, if not the high 90s.

From the superb acting displayed in every single scene to the terrifically well thought out storyline and writing. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are 2 very gifted actors and that is ever present all throughout the prestige, they have impeccable chemistry between themselves and all the other co stars they are performing on screen with. Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca hall are great here too, they both gave focused, intense performances. The plot seems rather simple and like there is not much to it by simply reading it on IMDb, but not everything is as it seems ;). This film is full of so many twists and turns that you'll have to really really watch closely.... As any audience at a magic show would. The movie leaves you feeling amazed and rethinking the scenes in the movie, piecing it all together drawing conclusions. Christopher Nolan is a truly truly talented filmmaker, that becomes evident and obvious to any viewer of this movie. 10/10 for the prestige, it's not hard at all to see why it's in the top rated 150 films.

On the other hand, there are those films that become even more fascinating when revisited, since the fact that we know their secrets offers new and surprising readings - in other words: what was mere surprise turns into rich dramatic irony. This is the case of works such as The Sixth Sense, Mulholland Drive, Magnolia, Psycho, Fight Club, American Hustle and, to cite just one more beautiful example, The Prestige.",

Not only does it entertain (and that is something it does exceptionally well) but it makes you think for a long time after. The final twist leaves you amazed and exhilarated. It includes magic, love, women, money, travel, self-sacrifice and all these factors put together by an excellent cast make the whole thing spectacular. Christian Bale is unforgettable as the charming Cockney who is charged for the murder of his rival, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman).

Everything has been executed so perfectly. The storyline is so scattered yet so well knit. All the scenes, starting from beginning to end, unfolding series of events, the take overs through diaries, the flashbacks, even the last scene, it's marvellous.

But, all that aside, it was a brilliant film - not as good as she was making it out to be but an overall good film. It is one that definitely needs the full attention of watchers as you can get confused easily but it's a film that everyone can enjoy really. Even David Bowie fans!! He was pretty good with his accent - reminds me of his song China Girl! It's a proper ""expect the unexpected"" film - don't want to spoil it for you so I'll leave it there. If you don't like complicated films then I wouldn't watch it but it is a must-see-before-you-die (sorry for the negative!!). It has action, romance, slight horror as well - a proper thriller!",

697,7 February 2015,Seraphion,8," Great story of magic, rivalry and tricks","The story literally blows away minds. It's nicely complex yet it spreads all the significant details right under our nose the whole time. Just as the Angier refuses to admit that Borden's trick is just a simple one, the movie nicely steers the audience into waiting to make a conclusion about the final deal about the secret of the prestige. The additional thing put by the magic tricks, the romance angles, Tesla and Edison, and the subplot with Borden's child is just great. But looking back to this movie, it feels strange that the movie reveals all the hidden secrets and resolves all questions at the end, which are not the typical of a Christopher Nolan movie. The acting overall is great. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale nicely put on the rivalry between their characters. Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall nicely complete the additional romances and intrigues angle. Michael Caine completes the movie with his mentor role.",

700,1 November 2020,Abdulxoxo,8, Sophisticated,"One thing I like about this movie is the complexity of the characters, you can't really tell who is the protagonist or the antagonist, they both at some point good and bad, so when the movie decided to make the Borden character as if he's the ""good guy"" I was a bit annoyed, considering he started the circle in the first place when he didn't show real regret or remorse after accidentally killing Angier's wife. And the twin twist at the end was a bit too much and forced, even though it helped us understand the Borden much better, I think they should have let it as it was; Angier got the upper hand and Borden died so the audience will sympathise with Borden since his character in the majority was perceived as the ""bad guy"" and Angier who is supposedly the protagonist will now be the antagonist at the end, even without the twist. And there's one thing that got me scratching my head; How come Borden knew Tesla could build something that could teleport? yes he misled Borden that's for sure but it seemed like he knew that it was evenly possible that Tesla could build such thing.",

A perfect film with magical performances of all the actors: Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman make a memorable performance and Michael Caine is Spectacular! Scarlet Johanson gives to us her pretty and her talented to act. David Bowie is interesting. Andy Serkis is strange, being another creature that it isn't Gollum or King Kong. With a fantastic direction and screenplay from Christopher Nolan: a person who I want to say thanks for films like ""Memento"" or ""Batman Begins"". The set, the costumes, the cinematography are so good too. The soundtrack takes to us into the film. ",
702,20 May 2007,Luigi Di Pilla,5, A special thriller,The storyline is very tricky and you have to pay some attention here. It is a thriller from another view of dimension. I didn't see many of those films that have to do with illusions. My wife didn't like it because the time is set in the last century but I don't mind. So we had at the end of the movie mixed emotions and opinions. She gave a 3/10 and me a solid 7/10. I never got bored because the pace was rather fast and there were finally many surprisingly scenes till the end when I was impressed solving the enigmas. All the cast delivered a respectable performance and the director was very good after his disappointing Memento. I think for all these reasons the audience gets a very interesting show. Final vote is a solid 5/10. I am curious how will do the other THE ILLUSIONIST.,

Must you act 'ave a cuppa tea gvnor!' Scarlett?? I swear I heard you say 'like totally!' But most of all, what really made me mad what really insulted was the end twist! You mean to tell me you spent the whole movie working towards something that was so obvious!! We saw it half an hour during the movie, we guessed it in the relationships! We saw it written in the very in your face dramatic irony! We saw it as obvious as all my exclamation marks! There wasn't even an attempt at diversion. It was poor.

706,29 January 2008,avaricewillkillu,1," Good Movie, but a Let Down","Okay, so everyone i know is raving about how good the prestige is. I admit myself that it looked really good on the trailers. Maybe its because i had such high expectations that i was so devastated by this terrible ending. If you've seen the movie you know the whole time everyone is questioning how the real transported man works. You keep wondering, if its not a double then HOW THE HECK IS THE TRICK DONE!?!!?!! Its a classic move, make a mystery the whole movie, and then when the explanation comes at the end everyone is amazed. This should be how it works. But the prestige ignores all convention and lays down that terrible terrible ending. The whole point of the movie is that you wonder how the trick is done. Then when they reveal it you are expecting some really cool trick. ""how does the man make his body transport?"" for some reason the answer to that question is: He simply clones himself and drowns himself every night! DUH! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Im expecting some cool trick and the explanation of how he does the impossible trick is that he does an equally impossible thing. Thats not an explanation thats just another impossible thing. Thats like me making a movie where a certain person can come back from the dead and saying ""okay the trick is that he can time travel and just avoid his original death!"" ""get it? i explained it for u!!!"" Okay well because of that i gave it a 3, it got a 3 cuz the movie was good but the ending was a big let down.",

Her character is not developed enough for us to know why she is as treacherous as she is. Michael Caine is excellent and steals every scene he's in. But he is not in enough scenes to save the movie.

712,29 May 2012,brando647,9, Nolan's Exceptional Venture into the World of Magic,"After reinventing the Batman franchise and reminding audiences how awesome they can be when Joel Schumacher isn't involved, director Christopher Nolan took the time to do his own thing. The result was THE PRESTIGE, further proof that Nolan doesn't need a man in a bat costume to prove how awesome a director he is. Nolan is one of the best directors in modern Hollywood for weaving a gripping story with powerful performances from his cast. In THE PRESTIGE, Nolan introduces the audience to the behind-the-scenes world of magic (stage magic, not fantasy magic) with the tale of two rising magicians with an ongoing feud that ultimately consumes both of their lives. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are a couple of magician's assistants/audience plants with aspirations of rising to the top in the world of magic. When a botched escape act ends with the death of Angier's wife, Angier blames Borden and the two part ways as Angier stews with thoughts of vengeance. As Borden goes on to make a name for himself, Angier rages at the thought that Borden be given success after what he'd done and begins a war of escalation as each tries to sabotage the other's acts. The war between the two reaches a new level when Borden debuts a new act called the Transported Man and Angier becomes obsessed with learning the secret, eventually turning to infamous scientist Nikola Tesla to harness the power of science in creating his own version.",

716,27 March 2007,schappe1,6, Modern Magicians,"I agree with those who have said that ""The Illusionist"" and ""The Prestige"" are not really comparable just because they are stories of magicians in the Victorian Era, (although I think ""The Prestige"" must be Edwardian because Nikola Tesla didn't move to Colorado Springs until 1899). But you can learn about films by comparing them to similar films and the temptation to make the comparison is great. When I rent films, I usually rent two at time because I figure one of them is bound to be better than the other. I find it interesting to rent films that have some relation to each other: the original and the remake or the sequel; two films with the same actor or director or author; two top films from the same year, or two films in the same genre. These two were an ideal mix.",
717,27 November 2006,Clemhop,4, Crap Covered Pretzel with Sweet Glaze,"I'm going to go ahead and tell you right now that you wouldn't be missing all that much if you didn't see this movie. It tries to pass itself as historical fiction, pertaining to a time period in which magicians were willing to do anything to usurp their fellow illusionists, but at the end it dabbles much too far into the realm of impossibility-explained-with-science that it effectively ruins itself and drops down to the uninteresting ""sci-fi"" category.",
718,16 October 2007,travisbickle76-1,10, Pure genius!,"At one point in the film, Hugh Jackman's character says ""That was the greatest magic trick I've ever seen."" I walked out of the theater thinking the same goddamn thing! This whole movie is just one big trick that the filmmakers have pulled on you, and by the time it's over, you'll realize that you just spent a couple bucks on a huge, two-hour magic trick. This may be my favorite movie ever. Just when you think you know what's going on, something else happens! It is very, very complicated stuff. There are flashbacks upon flashbacks, and it may be a little difficult to follow. Acting a key element in this film, and it's mostly great. Christian Bale carries it all on his shoulders, as he truly is the ""Prestige"" to the film's great rick, which I will not reveal. Hugh Jackman is good as the magician who grows mad with power, but Bale far surpasses him. Michael Caine is as memorable as always, but he's essentially playing a harsher version of the character he played in ""Batman Begins"". One of the best performances comes from Rebecca Hall as Bale's wife, who becomes confused and depressed after he loses his former glory. Scarlett Johannson isn't really offered much to work with but she does have a few memorable moments. The films final twists and turns will leave you so shocked that you realize everything you were going to say you hated about the movie, you now love. See this magic trick.

Each and every actor played their respective parts well. Basically, there are two rival magicians and they're both trying to out do each other, what happens is that they both sabotage their rivals' acts. This leads them both to a driving obsession that takes over their lives. They both become so obsessed with magic that they don't seem to notice everything else in life. At the end of the film all of the twists come out... and the film becomes very, very interesting after that. You have to watch it twice to understand the entirety of the film.",

Better than Dark Knight, better than Batman Begins and definitely better than Inception. It wouldn't be an understatement to say it is probably one of the most underrated movies of all time. All Nolan movies that followed have been exceptional but still won't be able to match The Prestige. The Prestige is an instant classic.

Actually I think my anonymous sideshow barker is being a bit harsh, for this particular confection, viewed as sheer entertainment, has a lot going for it. . First, there are two strong performances from Hugh Jackman, and Christian Bale as the two dueling magicians (or is it illusionists?), Robert Angier and Alfred Borden. Then there's a faultless supporting performance as Michael Caine, in wise old buffer mode, as Cutter, the trick deviser. Then there's the invocation of the late Victorian/Edwardian atmosphere, when society seemed to be so straitlaced and stratified, yet unimaginable change was already on its way. Lastly, there's the paradox that even though, especially via Cutter, we get to see the magic business from the inside, what's really going on is concealed until the end  and possibly beyond.",

Great performance from all actors except David Bowie who just about passed first base. The period setting was totally convincing and the on stage drama the best since Amadeus.

My wife loved it and I can see how some people would. It was pretty well put together, good acting, & a few good special effects. It did keep you guessing...almost too much. By the end of the movie I was wondering what the next 'twist' would be. Some of them you saw coming, some were not so obvious but it was apparent that the author of this story was trying to keep you guessing about the nature of good and evil and made it difficult to pick out who was good and who was bad. My only true gripe with the movie was the second act. After reading a review of the book I found that I wasn't alone on this. Some people will let it pass and just enjoy the movie but I couldn't. The movie takes a drastic turn to the super-natural (even though they half heartedly try to explain it as inexplicable science). Normally I wouldn't be put off by science-fiction or magic or whatever but this movie started off like it was based in reality and then just changed. If they could have created a plot device that would serve the same purpose as Hugh Jackman's ultimate trick without the super-natural I probably would have enjoyed it more. I think most people will enjoy this and if you're interested you shouldn't avoid it because of my comments. It was still a well done movie, it just isn't for everyone.",

He is an exceptional auteur, and wields the conventions of time, space, and suspense like a master... and The Prestige is indeed his masterpiece. Everything from the direction, to the ambiance, to the nuanced performances just sucks you into this world. It is perhaps no coincidence that this film plays like a magic trick. As Nolan manipulates the viewer through his 'pledge', and 'turn'. The artful misdirection within these first two acts, makes the impact of his 'Prestige' even greater.",

Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden ( Christian Bale) are friendly magicians who share an act until one night something goes terribly wrong and makes them enemies. Both wont rest until the other outdoes the other or sabotages each others performance. i have to say this is Hugh Jackmans finest performance here as well as Michael Caine as John Cutter the stage engineer. Christian Bale is also good as well as Scarlett Johansson but unfortunately this stunning actress is used much. The Prestige for me is the best movie of the year so far. Hopefully this movie gets recognized at Oscar time. When you see this movie, pay attention very closely cause if you blink you wont get the ending. my jaw dropped at the end. christopher nolan is one of the best directors today and this film shows that. are you watching closely?",

I agree with the latter's opinion. Even though the story is interesting and absorbing, the script is written so poorly. A plot is messy, and characters are indistinct. At the beginning of the story, so many characters are introduced, and so much information is bombarded without making one thing clear after another. Nolan does this kind of unkind presentation in some of his movies. Sci-fi genre has a world that a director creates and shapes from the scratch to finish and rules that only director can set, and mutual understanding of this world and rules between a director and audience is foundation to continue and enjoy the film. Nolan so many times becomes arrogant and ignores this agreement. It does not have to be chronological, but when the sequence moves from England to Colorado swiftly and redundantly, the director forgets to set the boundary between the two and even between Angier and Borden's time. For example, when Angier attends Telsa's seminar which is supposed to be held in America, he spots Borden and his happy family who are supposed to be in England. A little misunderstandings like this keep adding up, and audience keeps going back to where leap of logic happened, making unable to give the whole attention to the ongoing narrative.",

I don ' t understand the fact that Angel finally killed another one. How did the other Angel come from? The point is that you are eager to be deceived by the plot from the beginning. When you are completely caught in a scam, what you see is only what the director wants you to see. This is also the greatness of the film. Nolan has the same level of control over the mood of watching movies as Hitchcock!",

752,6 December 2018,albertsmith-32785,6, Nolan's first misstep? Maybe.,"This film is too smart, or perhaps the word should be convoluted, for its own good. Nolan has crafted a movie about obsession and revenge under the guise of magic but the execution stalls in many areas. Watching The Prestige is like observing a magic act where the magician's sleight-of-hand isn't deft enough. The trick almost works, but not quite... With its mechanical twists and turns and lack of heart, the movie often resembles Sleuth in superficial ways, except The Prestige resorts to cheating while Sleuth relied on cunning and guile. As is too often the case with narratives that try to be oblique to the end, the film's climax is strangely predictable. The Prestige goes to a great deal of trouble - including a triple time-line - to protect secrets that aren't all that surprising or hard to guess. The acting by the leads- Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale is top notch but that should be a given.",

Her bereaved lover seeks revenge. Bale and Jackman try to outdo each other. The two boxes with the disappearing and then reappearing man is the best, but how is it done? The answer is revealed. Supposedly Bale drowns, but he doesn't. Jackman is jailed for his murder. Bale takes his daughter.
This film must be seen for it actors and plot twists. Michael Caine is so great to see. Bale and Jackman have similar looks. Johansson is always intriguing in that although beautiful her emotions don't project causing her to appear alien.
Jackman's wife Sarah feels unloved and who wouldn't. These characters are obsessed with creating the three steps of a magic trick. Prestige is the third step where the disappearing in step two returns. The cinematography had to be like an oil painting capturing the times of 1890s and Colorado. The courtroom scenes are brief. The editing could be faster, but the occult tone is maintained. The score is great, because it remains unobtrusive. The major theme is that viewers want to see a trick gone wrong.",

756,19 May 2017,donal-rob,9, The Prestige,"A truly great movie that keeps the audience anticipating what is going to happen next throughout. ALIST cast, along with a master director. A film that doesn't receive the credit it deserves. Doesn't stick to a particular genre and holds acting performances that I believe Oscar worthy. Hugh Jackman, the gifted method actor swaps his aggressive wolverine blades and plays a obsessive magician who holds every card in his pocket; the love of showmanship. However, Jackman isn't the only magician in this monumental tale of rivalry. Christian Bale also plays as his bitter rival. Bale, being the best magician in my opinion, although he doesn't hold the same characteristics and showmanship as Jackman, it is hard not to be fooled by the magicians mysterious ways and Bales tremendous acting displaying his love for magic and trickery. A love story for the obsession of magic and being a entertainer surrounds the movie, along with other hard hitting life events. Loved ones lost from Both sides, this tale of two men fighting against each other is sure to keep you guessing while you crunch on your movie food and it is nearly impossible to predict what happens next from beginning to end.",

I really didn't think Hugh Jackman though was going to be the bad guy, I thought Christian Bale was going to be the bad guy, but it kind of switched around when the Hugh Jackman who wasn't that Lord something, but other than that, I really liked this movie, and I really hope it will go all the way this year.",

The film stars Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine. Caine plays the mentor of both magicians. The movie is shot out of order and sort of begins with the end. But just when you think you know how the movie really ends, it throws you for a huge twist. I won't divulge into the plot because if I do I'll spoil a lot of it.

The story just does not flow well, it is told in a very serious dark tone which just makes it seem too ridiculous and not at all believable. A lot of the dialogue is quite bad and clichéd especially involving Chistian Bale who just isn't up to the part. The story is an interesting one but the way it's told is not. Only in the last half an hour does it really get going but in the end it leaves you unsatisfied and irritated at the liberties it's taken with you.

Instead, The Prestige tries so desperately to be the mind-melt it is envisioned as that the constant surprises feel suspiciously rote, character motivation feeling surprisingly laughable.

The scenes of magic were extraordinary and creepy, transporting the viewer back to the world of a master conjuror's stage in the year 1900. By contrast, The Prestige had a silly, trivial plot that just kept repeating the schtick of two magicians who were rivals for no purpose, unimpressive ""tricks"" on the stage, and the preposterous Tesla device that duplicated everything like a surreal photocopy machine. The movie also took huge liberties, jumping around in time: one minute D'Anton was in London, and the next in Colorado, multiple times.

I thought Hugh Jackman owned his role and Christian Bale was excellent as well. Did not expect to see David Bowie, either, that was an unexpected but awesome! The story was entertaining the whole way through, it always left me on my feet, wanting to figure out what was going to happen next. Christopher Nolan created the perfect balance of intrigue and confusion. Just watch this movie.",
785,16 January 2008,Steve G-2,8," Now, watch closely!","This was a delightfully twisted film. As others have said, the mood, acting, staging and script are all right on. The characters are strikingly real, although it would have been so easy to make them just stage characters; even when their behavior is temporarily hard to understand, it is also hard to disbelieve. Where it really excels, however, is inserting an element of science fiction with the other ""magic"" so smoothly that it does not seem out of place. Most people with whom I have watched the film entirely failed to notice more than one significant plot element, not because what was happening was concealed, but because - well, after all, it's illusion, isn't it? Throughout, and especially by the time you get to the end, you don't expect to really understand. Only when you really think about it and discuss it afterward do you realize that within its own terms, it all hangs together beautifully.",
786,28 October 2006,vichayley,9," Not as dark, or as good as it should have been","Maybe I'm still bitter, because I was hoping to see a dark tale about evil magicians and, possibly, some wizardry. Instead, what I got was an overdrawn, dragged out costume flick that gave away all of its suspense way too early. Anybody, who can't figure this film out within a half hour needs to get off the Xanax and stop daydreaming. I knew from the start that there was no way that Batman killed Wolverine, at least not the way he was being accused. Like the movie repeatedly asks ""are you watching?"", all the answers are given quite early. When Borden's wife makes the assertion that some days he loves her and others he doesn't, that alone tells you there is another. I know I'll probably be ripped to shreds for my opinion on this film, but it's mine and I'll stick to it. And for god's sake what was Scarlett Johansson even doing here. Don't get me wrong, I love Scarlett, she's a great talent, but every scene she was in dragged, she looked like she would rather be somewhere else the whole time. I assume she and Jessica Biel have both sworn off magicians for life. The one thing I really enjoyed in this film? David Bowie. The man still has a presence that musicians and actors of today would kill for. One last thing? Was Edison really such an evil bastard that he would destroy any competition that came? I'll have to look into it.",
787,22 October 2006,shattenjager777,8," An entertaining watch, but unfortunately thin and repetitive","Christopher Nolan's recent films (""Memento,"" ""Insomnia,"" and ""Batman Begins"") have all been based on the same theme: The power of obsession to increase a person's ability to create and destroy simultaneously. However, while those earlier films also explored other subjects (respectively, the importance of objective reality as opposed to subjective memory, the line between proving someone's guilt and framing him, and whether action or belief defines a person), ""The Prestige"" is entirely about the single theme. The biggest problem with this difference is that Nolan does not wring enough interesting aspects out of the theme to build an entire film--it only shows us the effects of the obsessions on our main characters instead of exploring the effects any further and it even includes an archetypal wise older character who has already lived it in the person of Nikola Tesla to give one of our heroes advice and give the film's themes voice in case anyone hasn't noticed being beaten over the head with it.",

This movie is fascinating on many levels and I can't say informative but thought provoking enough that I found myself spending a few hours learning the difference bt AC and DC currents, and despite his brilliance what a ruthless capitalist and businessman Thomas Edison was (When you see most photos of Edison you see the stern and serious look of the businessman not the brilliant inventor). His ego was so bruised by AC currents being more logistical than DC currents, that he falsely put on displays murdering animals with AC currents falsely claiming it was more dangerous....but I digress.
This film brought into the spotlight
1. How competition at a certain point crosses ethical lines, the human need that when dedicated to a goal attaining the means is rationalized and adapted to justify the immoral and unethical behavior to attain that goal. We've seen that in all sports (Brady-gate in the NFL, Ali finding doctors to create hyperthyroidism to meet weight when he was passed his prime and repeatedly warned to hang up his cloves, head butting and blighting ears, counting cards, corporate espionage etc. Unfortunately it's not something we become overly concerned with until there is a victimization the mortgage crisis of 07.
2. The parallel bt. The two magicians and fictitious Tesla vs Edison...without spoilers you find out relatively quickly which one was Edison minded.
3. The difference between wanting to be the best and wanting to be authentic and creative.
4. How we deal with rage and anger whether it's legitimate or misdirected and how dangerous it can be when left unchecked (we already know how that rage can be magnified when it becomes sociological...fights in the stands at NFL and European Football games. If home alone your disgust you'll pound the arm of your chair, maybe yell at the screen. A few beers and ten like minded people turns that into a bar brawl.
5. I'd say one of Christian Bale's most brilliant performances or most skilled cosmetics person because on first viewing well I won't spoil.
Well written Mr. Nolan along with Tarantino perhaps on a higher level simply mastering special effects and cinematography on 35 mm film using sets as opposed to green backdrops with CGI.

There are some filmmakers where from the very beginning you can tell that they are going to be legendary. Steven Spielberg obviously comes to mind, but I also think of filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola, Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, and James Cameron. But there's one other name that I think should be on that list: Christopher Nolan. This man has yet to make a film I didn't like or even didn't think was at least great. From the Dark Knight trilogy to Interstellar, from Inception to Dunkirk, this man has done so many amazing things with film-making today. I have yet to see his first three films ""Following,"" ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia,"" but from what I've heard, they are also great films.

A few notes only that worth a few arguments: the very persuasive sense of the era of late 1800s, one of the most interesting of all times; he managed to give the deepest depth of the 2 main characters and the master Caine, at his best roles/acting ever, he fitted like the hand in glove; for a movie that could easily slip in the category of ""entertaining"" aspect of cinema ,mainly,because of the theme itself never did. Is the first time that I see the beloved Scarlet J and not ""concentrate"" on her at all, neither even comment on her; the plot and the mystery wouldn't leave my notice a moment to spent on her physical assets, but the serious part of the plot; that had never had an inch of chasm, neither left any doubt to the rather unbelievable, almost surreal happenings and scenes; the logic was always there masterly hidden. Also the Tesla character is as peculiar as should be; N Tesla was one of the most genius, non-conventional scientists of all times and the choice of Bowie added a lot to that feeling. Of course, last but not least, the astonishing ending, that one moment ago could not be expected neither imagined in such an imaginative scenario. Thank you Mr. Nolan once again, keep it on!",

If you have not seen this film, please stop reading now. The film has very good sets and the acting is well done. I cannot complain about either of these two aspects of the film. All actors are top notch. My big beef is with the logic of the storyline. The film starts off with a murder. Hugh Jackman is found drowned in a water tank after falling into it through a trap door from the stage above. Hugh Jackman is copying a magic trick that is done by Christian Bale does with his twin brother who is always disguised and no one knows he has a twin. Later, you find out Hugh Jackman finds a scientist named Tesela who created a machine that can create doubles of anything, but it teleports it nearby. Hugh Jackman uses the machine to make a copy of himself, has a trapdoor that falls into a watertank and drowns the copy on the stage and comes out from wherever it teleports him. His arch nemesis Christian Bale is framed for murdering Hugh Jackman and one of the twin is hung. That's basically it. Now, the tear apart begins. Is the secret twin is just ridiculous. He's going to spend years and years and years, dressing up and hiding his twin, just for one lame magic trick that didn't even do too well? Next, His twin brother is about to be hung and he STILL doesn't come forward and say he's a twin to clear his name. Plus, they were both with the same woman and she didn't know? Next, Hugh Jackman finds out he can clone himself. Bale can pull off his trick with just his brother. Couldn't Jackman just make like two copies of himself and do the trick even better? No, the dumb ass drowns himself every time for some reason. With two copies of yourself, you don't NEED to drown yourself. Not to mention, Jackman could make copies of gold or money, and he never does. Instead, the guy drowns himself over and over again because ""He's not sure who the original is and who is the clone."" I'm pretty sure the dude that materialized out of thin air is the clone. It's totally unbelievable.",

It features my hands down favourite performances of both Bale and Jackman, it inspires conversation and debate, and it's pure misdirection over misdirection over misdirection in a way that only Nolan could have pulled off.

The imagery is quite beautiful throughout, and I enjoyed the bits where they revealed how certain magical tricks worked (the bird vanishing/reappearing trick was particularly good). These scenes do a very good job of showing you how everything is an illusion, and you need to figure out what's going on behind the scenes (which seems to be the obsession of both magicians, played ably by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman). But I focused a bit too much on that aspect of it and was disappointed with one aspect of the latter half, where all rational/realistic explanation fails and the movie becomes somewhat fantastic. This, I felt, compromised the earlier promise of the movie to reveal how everything was simply an illusion that could be explained by ordinary means.",

Christopher Nolan has directed yet again another movie worth the price of admission. Many say that it is too long, but (like every perfectionist) Nolan takes about half an hour just to set up. Nolan places his signature on the film as it starts out ahead of the story and goes back. Few could pull off this film due to the confusion of the story's twists and how to reveal them coherently to the viewer while giving off an exciting energy. The costumes were great and really made it feel Victorian.

828,7 March 2007,Scotty_Cantwell,6," Clever, but not highly compelling or memorable","A very clever film (not surprising for a film about a couple of magicians) that is so concerned with being clever, that it becomes a little confusing. I was left thinking I needed to watch it again, not because of the pleasure I had watching it, but because I wasn't sure I ""got it,"" completely. The problem was that I had absolutely no sympathy for the two magicians who were so self absorbed, and mean spirited in their relentless ambition to out-do each other, that I couldn't bring myself to watch it again. Also, I think it was a little too long for what it was, to the point of getting a little tedious. All this is not to say that there aren't some positives. Firstly, the cinematography in this film is outstanding. I saw this on DVD, but I can imagine it would be great on the big screen. The wardrobe and set design where excellent, which really helped bring an aura of authenticity to this period piece. The acting was pretty darn good as well, which is no surprise, considering the veteran talent in the cast. I enjoyed seeing David Bowie as Nicolai Tesla; he so transformed into this character that I didn't realize at first who the actor was. Also, it added an element of interest to call attention to Tesla the man, whose visionary theories are considered revolutionary, even in modern times. Although duplicating people...this may be a little much even for Tesla. But I'm no expert on Tesla. The Presence of Scarlett Johansson in the cast was also one of the reasons I wanted to see this film. Her role here, though, was a little on the insubstantial side. Not surprisingly, she is cast typically (it seems, lately) as the smokin' hot eye candy of the film. She certainly is capable of playing character roles of much more depth, as I have seen in films such as ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" for example. Nonetheless, I think she did do a good job here, for what it was. So all in all, I would have to say that for me this was a mildly interesting and entertaining film, though certainly not highly compelling or memorable.",

830,5 July 2007,mgm-43,8, The movie is about more than the trick,"If all you read are some of the other comments here, you might think  ""The Prestige"" is a cheat and a disappointment. And maybe if you are  watching it with a superficial mindset, it is. But if you really pay  attention, and delve into the many layers of story, you will see the  movie as so much better than that.  Two magicians rival to be the best, and this movie takes you through  many years of that rivalry, along with the resulting jealousy, anger,  betrayal, and ethic and moral dilemma. Oh, and did I mention death,  disfigurement, and deception? The performances are gripping, and the  production is stunning, creating a believable setting that draws you  into the story. I did experience some moments of confusion when the  time lines jumped into the past or present a bit abruptly. But in the  end, most questions will be answered. It's important to remember,  though, that the most compelling question is not what was real and what  was deception, but rather, how far do you allow yourself to go to prove  you're the best?",

At first I was a bit skeptical of watching it because of how complicated Nolan's films are, and on top of it this one is about magicians. So that would be even more confusing.

After all, gimmicks are more than necessary in a film about magic tricks and illusions. On a second watch, you will notice that all the clues have been there from the beginning, incredibly easy to spot. However, the film manages to do the magic and keep the tricks almost unnoticed until the three timelines converge at the end.

836,28 March 2007,ghugesujay,9, The Prestige- A Truly Outstanding Movie,"Christopher Nolan strikes back!!!! He is one stylish Hollywood director who knows how to make you believe the unbelievable. What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians it is also a complex character study about how self-destructive an obsession can be. Integrating this plot with a love story and a sci-fi twist truly makes this a masterpiece. The Prestige comes with a unique plot with a fabulous drama and an amazing star cast - mainly two powerful, riveting stars in Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman any of whom could believably garner an Oscar nomination. Pitting these two seasoned performers against each other was a stroke of a casting genius- it feels like a perfect fit for director Nolan's sensibilities. The director has very well recreated a period of show business history- an era during which competition between magicians was serious and intense. The script written by director Christopher Nolan based on a novel by Christopher Priest is itself a juggling act, bouncing back and forth in time, teasing us with a whole extra layer of suspense. It keeps you interested and keeps you guessing right to the shocking but most appropriate end. A real entertainer and a truly outstanding movie, The Prestige is well worth seeing on a big screen for its grand scope and vision.",

Surprisingly the best performance I thought came from David Bowie as the émigré to America N. Tesla. His struggles with English were the only governor to his genius. All the rest Bale,Jackman performed very well. I would give the edge to Bale as he perhaps had the more challenging role. Michael Caine comes to each role now with an accumulation of experience that makes his performances as taken for granted as richly designed tapestry unnoticed until you consciously examine the weave,cut,and design. Perhaps the only disappointment as far as acting goes is from Scarlet Johannson's performance although in looks as always she is a delight for the eyes. Obviously,to say too much about the movie risks spoiling it. The concept was original. The movie itself 'mirrors' the three parts of a magic trick.

However the second time we caught a glimpse of this mysterious character, I figured out the ""mystery"". An undeveloped character with a beard, lowered hat, and obviously disguised? Hmm. I could tell his eyes were Christian Bale's from the start. And as the movie dragged on, with this character speaking no lines, it only proved the obvious. Fallon is Borden's ""double"" (twin) with makeup and fake facial hair. He is too underdeveloped, mysterious, and quiet to be anything else. And he just plain looks like Christian Bale! (minus the fatter cheeks from the prosthetic.) The clues stacked up too high throughout. How certain lines to Fallon were worded. His role in the family. The altering personalities of Borden.

Both show a wonderful talent in their acting and convincing roles in this most enjoyable movie about two magicians out to destroy one another. This movie does have a few nice surprises as it gets deeper into its story, making this one a movie to see for sure. Michael Caine takes what could have been a forgettable role in this movie and elevates it with his demanding screen presence. He did a great job. Probably the most surprising performance comes from David Bowie, with his unforgettable chance to play this role as master physicist, his performance was superior.

Another really realistic and maybe somehow terrifying fact that you become aware of by watching the movie is what one can do to achieve his biggest desires.

Tesla himself would have laughed as he was aware of the law of conservation of matter and energy. The outcome is just wrong - both magicians should have ended up as the figurative ""Man in the Box"".

The initial rivalry and physiological warfare that goes on between Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman is a really effective plot device because you know how much it means to both of them to be the best there motivations are very understandable and the tole that it takes on them is truly intriguing to watch unfold. I adored watching the mechanics of the magic tricks it makes you realise how simple it is while never ruining the magic for you. The setting of 19th century is just a marvel to watch the production design is seamless and you can clearly tell that a lot off effort went in to it. To date I think this is Hugh Jackman finest performance it really showed his acting range from a happy yet naive magician to a haunting and damaged character. Christian Bale is also really good in this film he feels natural and it's truly disturbing to watch his life fall apart in conjunction with Hugh Jackman's. Scarlett Johansson also gives the greatest performance of her career in this film she's perfect at portraying the one thing these two characters still have in common. David Bowie was fantastic in this movie he's really mysterious yet somewhat wise and or definitely one of the best performances ever given by a musician. Christopher Nolan directed this movie beautifully everything from the editing, to the stage illusions to the little moments that set up for the final twist are all done perfectly and it do date amazes me The the academy continue to snub him.

I mean, no such coincidence. Not to mention that if Borden was in prison- Borden was in love with Olivia, then why was he acting like he was the baby's biological father when ""Sir Caldlow"" brought her in?

At first I was a bit skeptical of watching it because of how complicated Nolan's films are, and on top of it this one is about magicians. So that would be even more confusing. After having seen Tenet I was overestimating this film. It's nothing as complicated (though it is fairly so), and that's for a good thing.",

What an amazing story line with the right combination of love, hate, science, magic, action and adventure! Fewer movies are being created with the energy and passion of The Prestige. Not a line or shot is wasted - and the 2+ hours run time flies by. For me, it was truly a pleasure to see David Bowie back on the big screen and playing such a key role. Of course, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are wonderful eye candy - but the depth of each of their characters draws you in as well. Perfect in every way - and in my top 10 movies of all-time!",

Upon the second viewing is when subtle clues become more clear and the ending of the film becomes much more believable.

This turned to vinegar very quickly. The story began sensibly enough, but then quickly degenerates into an incoherent mess, as if the script was half-written when given the studio's green light, financed, and cast, then sloppily given a dopey, intelligence-insulting last written half. Having seen ""The Illusionist"", I almost thought they had attempted a poor satire of the much, much better movie. As if taking a cue from this nit-witty script, the acting, from such a star-studded cast, was amazingly half-rate. Scarlet Johanssen should not attempt a British accent ever, ever again; even Michael Caine's and Christian Bale's cockney accents were cringe-inducing and they're both British! Even with the large budget they were probably given for set design (it takes place around 1899), they still screwed this up and made it look incredibly amateurish - the scenes of Colorado Springs from a hillside made the town look like a wintertime snow-globe village. The special effects were wasted on the idiotic idea that Nicola Tesla built an energy globe that could replicate objects and, oh my God, people. All in all, a forgettable movie.",

With a simple story about a rivalry between two magicians lies a complex script full of symbolism and that itself is presented as an illusion.

(For The Prestige AND The Illusionist) I just don't understand it--I've read the reviews of this movie here on Amazon and only one other person seems to also feel that the movie was ridiculously predictable early on. The clues were in your face, and then repeated/flaunted/displayed over and over, ad nauseum. Then, to add insult to injury on top of the old hackneyed ""twin theme,"" some pseudoscience is thrown in to boot (clones created ""Highlander"" style--absurd bolts of electricity and all--Star Trek did cloning better in the 60's with Kirk on the whirly machine thing for God's sake). So Jackman's character kills himself/his clones over and over during every show waiting for the one time when Bale's character goes backstage, consequently pinning Jackman's murder on him. At the end they ""divulge"" the big secret that Bale has a twin (DUH?), and then the last scene shows Jackman floating in a tank and we're all supposed to go--wha? I mean wasn't it obvious that Jackman was killing himself over and over? (Or were all those hats and cats just extraneous props to throw us off?) And the Lord is...who?...is it really Hugh Jackman? Geez I didn't see that one coming...only A MILE AWAY. People keep comparing this movie to The Illusionist, but I thought the ending of The Illusionist was equally insulting--I mean, Paul Giamatti had to recount all the steps leading to the ""secret"" of the movie, when it was really obvious early on what had happened. I can only see Ed Norton, who was fantastic in Down in the Valley (as a dubious/not b&w character that kept you thinking) in the edit room arguing, ""What? Why do we have to spoon feed the audience?"" (Wasn't this ""recap"" device used already in Usual Suspects anyway?--only in Usual Suspects it was effective and necessary--at the end of the movie you really do go ""ah ha! I didn't see that coming! Simply brilliant."") Christian Bale was incredible in The Machinist and American Psycho (even Batman was interesting). He has the charisma of a rock in The Prestige. Michael Caine is...basically Michael Caine. Hugh Jackman--he IS Wolverine. In this movie he falls flat. I don't feel his anger. I should want Bale's character incinerated for what he did, though maybe inadvertently, to Jackman's wife. But I don't feel anything. I've been a fan of Scarlett since Ghost World. No extraordinary acting here though. David Bowie, however, (whether he looks like the real Tesla or not) was very engaging. I wanted to see more of him. Oh well.

Borden develops an act called The Transported Man, and an improved version named The New Transported Man, which appears to move him from one closed cabinet to another in the blink of an eye and without appearing to pass through the intervening space. The act seems to defy physics and puts all previous acts to shame. Although never explicitly revealed, it seems probable that the secret of The Transported Man is that Borden, all his life, has been two people; his trick involves extreme use of a twin brother as a double, to the extent that they both live the same life. Angier cannot discern the method that Borden uses and desperately tries to equal him, and with the help of the acclaimed physicist Nikola Tesla For Angier's trick, Tesla successfully creates a device capable of teleporting a being from one place to another, but which has a surprising side-effect.",

That's really something I appreciate very much and ""The Prestige"" is yet one another great piece of cinema. I like movies that deal with obsession. A recent one was ""The Aviator"" which I absolutely loved, but most people didn't. A thing that nearly all stories about main characters, who are obsessed with something share, is that their heroes are having the biggest troubles when it comes to interpersonal relations, and mainly in their love life. And that's a theme, which always gets me. The highlight of ""The Prestige"" for me is Christian Bale. His character and the way he plays him, that's A-rate acting. I also liked the  nowadays omnipresent  Scarlett Johansson, who had an unthankful thin part. Nolan continues his confusing style of storytelling and keeps the tempo up.

Creates a truly unique and almost surreal atmosphere to the movie that although is artificial, seems as if there is some sort of basis of authenticity whether it's in the screenplay or in its brilliant cinematography shots throughout the film.

918,22 November 2019,todyun,9, Well-done,"I really enjoyed this movie, even if I don't think it is quite the masterpiece as others see it as. There is a lot to appreciate about the film: the performances by Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, among others are all excellent, the script was expertly written, and the score was suspenseful and unnerving in a good way. Like many Nolan films, the best aspect to this film is the writing. The movie travels between different timelines seamlessly to deliver its narrative and I found this really effective. Many themes are incorporated cleverly in the script, such as duality and the price of obsession. The reveal at the ending of this movie is hinted at in many small details throughout the film, and it is great that a viewer can more readily observe these details after multiple viewings of the film. The entire script definitely was expertly structured and successfully played out like a magic trick.
The only reservation I have about the movie is its ending, which I have mixed feelings about. In the end, it is revealed that Borden had a twin brother the entire time. As said before, I think this reveal was expertly tied in to the rest of the script, but I think the concept itself is kind of stupid. There were many times where I considered the possibility that Borden had a twin, but I dismissed it because it seemed too simple. Even Hugh Jackman's character mentions once that Borden may have a double in delivering his trick, but dismissed it because it would be unlikely that the double also had an injured hand. However, the movie simplistically just states at the end that the double indeed had an injured hand and purposely injured himself to create this situation. Beyond that, there were also many things that didn't see realistic at all with this reveal. For instance, it makes no sense that Borden would need to let his brother die in prison. He could have just implicated Hugh Jackman while pretending to be Fallon, and then let his brother get released. Beside this plot whole, I felt that there were two ways to which this (in my opinion, overlysimplistic) ending could be justified. First, it could be argued that the obviousness of the ending was its point, and like a magic trick, it was always right in front of the audience but ignored because they want to be fooled. Otherwise, the ending could be understood as a shaggy dog story, where the point is that Angier sacrificed his entire life just to figure out and outcompete Borden's trick, up to the point where he found actual magic and risked his own life, just to find out that Borden's trick was just that he had a twin. The underwhelming reveal of Borden having a twin may just be intentionally used to emphasize the dangerous and ironic consequences that come from becoming too obsessed in your work. I am not convinced with either explanation, but I could see how someone could validly argue them.
The movie could have been a mindblowing masterpiece if it wasn't for the ending, but other than that, it is still pretty great, particularly due to its superb script. Definitely worth a watch.",
919,4 March 2007,oblio-8,6, Enjoyable but ultimately silly -- disappointing ending,"There are some fine performances in this movie, especially those by David Bowie and Michael Caine. It has a good plot (somewhat spoiled by the confusing flashback-within-a-flashback direction) and some good character studies. But the whole house of cards falls down when the story introduces the ludicrous notion that Tesla invented a machine that could replicate an entire human being -- including clothes and memories? Apart from the fact that it's unbelievable, it causes two problems in the narrative. First, it introduces a deus ex machina, which the Subtle Fiction Writers' Workshop defines as a no-no. Worse, it changes the entire milieu of the movie in mid-stream. Up to that point, we are in the realm of Victorian magic -- no matter what appears to have happened, everything is governed by physical laws. Rather than find a good way for Angier to best Borden, the writers use the cheap narrative trick of allowing Angier to simply step outside the laws of physics.",

When my girlfriend asked me if I wanted to watch it again, I was more than happy to acquiesce. You may be wondering how someone's attention could be held after watching a movie so many times. It can be summed up, quite simply, by the fact that Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director. He manages to take a movie that has one of the most simple themes and build an intricate plot around it. The movie focuses on the competition between two magicians as they each strive for supreme success. Along the way, they each face the hardships of death and the slow decline into obsession with their work. In one of the most influential scenes of the movie, one of the characters is begged to give up his quest for greatness because it will only bring him sorrow. He, of course, does not heed this warning, but I will not go deeper into that to avoid spoilers. Along with the way Christopher Nolan developed a brilliant plot, he did an incredible job of casting his roles. Hugh Jackman plays one of the magicians, Robert Angier, and Christian Bale was cast as his competitor, Alfred Borden. Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie each contribute vital side characters and stories. Ultimately, this movie was created to get your mind thinking in ways that are very far outside of the box. There are some supernatural events, yet it is easy to relate to certain characters in the film. One of my girlfriend's complaints was that she did not know who she was supposed to like in the movie, but I think that was Nolan's purpose. He wanted the viewer to look at the film from all perspectives and not be fixated on just one of them. I don't even like writing a review for this movie because it is one that almost needs to be entered with a completely open mind.",

One of the best thing about Christopher Nolan movies is that you have to pay attention to the small things as well. For example in prestige, when the kid asks "" where is his brother? "" was a moment i thought could be of importance which eventually proves correct. I won't spoil any bit of this masterpiece! But I'll suggest to watch it twice in order to grab how brilliant this movie is!",

940,14 November 2019,elvishawk,10, A love letter to filmmaking,"The Prestige is a outstanding thriller, that deals with obsession and sense of one's purpose. The dynamic of Angier and Borden is the heart of the movie, with a belivable rivalry builded from beginning to end.
There is a critiscism of this story, that the sci fi elements are out of place or too fantasious for the plot. But here is where The Prestige shines, the movie is an alegory of filmmaking itself, for exemple the 3 steps of a magic trick (the pledge, the turn and the prestige) are parelles of the 3 acts of a movie or the one who creates the trick don't get the applause of the crowd, he stays out of the stage, exacly as a director of a movie. This constant alegory and paralles between cinema and magic creates an metaphor that the movie itself is a magic trick. So with that in mind you have to figure out what is the ""secret"" of the movies, the unearthly element, ""the turn"", the something that elevates the ordinary rivalry between two magician into a unbelivable event and that is the Tesla machine, the sci fi element of the movie. Also there is clues for the dubious nature for the machine as it's never really seen the double outside of Angier perspective, it's an onimous feeling that the machine it's not something to belived in.

My friend and I discussed ""The Prestige"" for at least a half hour. The plot is very good. The only flaw with this movie was that it could become confusing because of the time shifts. The time-jumps were needed in order to inform the viewer of the entire story, but it can leave a few people feeling confused. I don't really wanna expose the ending, which is why I'm not writing much about the plot. The actors' performances were great, and they included a lot of passion in their work.

In THE PRESTIGE he creates a wonderfully dark and tense atmosphere, thanks to excellent use of music and superb cinematography and set design. There is hardly any day exteriors at all. The approach of scrambling the continuity works fine here and makes you pay extra attention, soon it will become such an often used device that audiences probably wont even notice. The acting is overall uniformly excellent, Michael Caine stands out as a center of gravity for the plot and the rest of the ensemble. Even David Bowie has improved his acting with age, and now also has great authority and weight, he hardly registers as ""Bowie"" at all. What you will make of the payoff is probably very individual, I thought it fitted the slightly surreal and dreamlike ambiance the rest of the movie had. The cinematography, as I mentioned, is stunning. It must have been an ordeal for the focus puller, since it is anamorphic, mostly hand-held, and often shot in under-lit locations.",
950,2 July 2015,ashuadya,8, Where ambition can lead you..,"The Prestige follows two magicians over the course of their career. What started as a friendly rivalry turned into much more. Borden and Angier, the two main protagonists start off as stage hands to an experienced magician, but after a horrible accident in an illusion involving Angier's wife goes wrong and she ends up drowning. And so starts the battle between the two magicians, as the movie progresses through the years it shows just how desperate each one gets to outdo the other. Until one day Borden shows his audience his ""Transported Man"" trick, Angier's mind snaps. Little does he know that he's not really looking for the secret to Borden's trick, but trying hard to emulate and improve it. That's what the movie hides so well. The scenic landscape of Colorado and Colorado springs captured by excellent camera work helps bring the grandeur to the movie. It's not just the fancy footage filmed in the mountains and valleys that really make this film, it's the faithful recreation of late 19th century London which sets the dark undertone of the film. The inclusion of an all-star cast solidifies each character's performance and personality, especially the likes of Michael Caine and David Bowie. Obviously since this is a film about magicians, the ""what happens next?"" moment occurs quite frequently and it's not just limited to the tricks they perform. Music in a movie has always been extremely important to me. Fortunately in Nolan's flicks, one can find much to appreciate in how a certain suite or soundtrack really binds the scene together. Although the movie isn't noted for its soundtrack it was still important in completing the scenes. Nolan's movies sometimes have a tendency to have ""empty"" scenes, for me there were definitely a few scenes which I thought were just filler.",

I've never been a fan of spoilers, so let's just say that you have to keep watching until the very end - and the film's ending is a testament to what can be done with a great script, excellent acting and top-notch directing. The film gives one the distinct feeling that the life of an illusionist is not one to be taken lightly. See this film! Trust me - you won't be disappointed! 9 out of 10!",

The rivalry between Jackman and Bale's characters is loaded with intrigue at every mesmerising twist and turn, and they are supported by a superb cast of characters each presented with an engaging part that the audience cannot fail to invest in.

Not like a modern day film, just a wonderful story. Cast well, acted well. But it is the complex story, the wonder of the magic and the wonderfully flawed and tragic characters carry this film to such heights. The complexity of their mistake riddled and shared history defines their relationships and their lives and is so well imagined and so well told on screen. I love Michael Caine's role and his applied example of the Ockham's Razor priniple. I've since read criticisms that relate to the depiction of Tesla and of Nolan as a director. Such criticisms have nothing to do with the entertainment value of this film in its own right. I thoroughly enjoyed this and will watch it again. It is a new favourite.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale both do great work here, and Michael Caine is exceptional. Scarlett Johansson is good, too, but she is underused in this male-dominant film. There is a lot of twists and turns, but the problem is, they also give away a lot of clues, right from the beginning shots, so if you have paid attention (and who wouldn't, once you enter the theater knowing you're about to see a mystery/thriller about magic), halfway through you would know how the story is going to end and what is happening.

Its a film about identity and personal obsessions mixed with the archaic art form of theatrical style illusionist's at the turn of the century. Biological, yet diabolical made twins versus sci-fi cloned twins - The mysteries of Gothic age science fiction inspired novels and all it's possibilities ( from Well's The Time Machine to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein ) and even earlier morality tales like Faustus and Prometheus. It has the same 'melting-pot' styling as the The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen - Try stuffing everything but the kitchen sink from Gothic novels and see what you get. What you get is ludicrous. Countless plot holes - Why would a couple of electricity buff cronies build a machine that could duplicate hats, cats and men, just hand it over rather than immediately start gold production/cloning ?

One day, Alfred invents a trick that seems to deny the laws of physics (but after all, this is magic and all magic tricks seem to deny the laws of physics). Robert sets his mind to figuring out Alfred's trick and improving it so he can come out as the better magician. His journey to understanding Alfred's trick takes Robert to the US where he meets a scientist who seems to have found a way to manipulate electrical energy at a whole new level.

At least that how it was for me, and that is how I watched this movie. When looking for the unexpected, which most people will do given the advertising for this movie, it is not hard to find at all, and while the exact details are only revealed later in the movie, the ending of the movie becomes clear at least an hour before it occurs, taking the edge off the 'suspense'.

The deception Bourdain wrote on that piece of paper , by sheer coincidence paid off to his ardent enemy in the most insane and unexpected way to both parties ( even to the creator ). Both characters were obsessed with one upping each other , as they each were conceited against one other. But in my opinion Angier's case was far worse.

This film does an incredible job of immersing the viewer. A large component of this movie , and of most of Nolan's , is that there are constant plot twists. Another film with this many twists and ould get convoluted and confusing very quickly but this would does an excellent job of both keeping you guessing and keeping you informed.",

I think The two magicians can represent two poles of any kind: From the scale of two normal persons competing in real life to two country leaders. Two rivals obsessed by a self destructive competition for the sake of getting all the glory. They both forgot the initial reason for which they started this. Each of them became obsessed trying to become the greatest no matter what the cost is. The choice of magic as a playground competition is the right one, as magicians trick the audience with illusions, it could be leaders tricking their people in real life with their own kind of illusions(Wrong cause, wrong battlefield...etc). For the sci-fi part, the poor scientific base doesn't worry me a lot as it succeeded to deliver the message of how dangerous and destructive it can be. Definitely a great movie worth watching!",

I did understand it though and thats says a lot about the editing and script. It is really one weird story but there is superb acting in it. YES michael caine is doing the same role as he always does and to an extent so is hugh jackman but they do it so well you really can't begrudge them it. But Christian Bale who I had never seen before was amazing, I completely loved him and I found him so believable I believed the loony story. He is going to be the next johnny depp (not that we really need another) but he is really really good. recently though, in all films there seems to be a fascination with fingers, or more to the point fingers getting cut or mashed or shot and this film is no exception. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang a guy gets his fingers cut off and in this a woman breaks hers and poor poor Christian Bale gets his shot off. It really isn't safe in showbiz now is it?",

1002,30 October 2006,macvader999,8, synopsis,"Surprisingly, the Prestige kept my attention until the end. I thought it would be a decent movie but it definitely was better than I thought it would be. The basic plot surrounds two magicians Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). The two start out working together but end up enemies after Angier's wife dies following a botched magic trick. Angier blames Borden for his wife's death claiming Borden tied the wrong knot that led to the drowning of his wife. Borden goes on to start a family and a solo magic act. He creates a trick I'll call ""the reappearing man"" where he bounces a ball then walks through a door and reappears through another door about 20 feet away and grabs the ball as it bounces past the 2nd door. Angier, who with the help of Cutter (Michael Caine) and Olivia (Scarlett Johansson-basically only used for sex appeal), creates a magic act as well. After watching one of Borden's shows, Angier is convinced that Borden uses a machine to transport himself from one door to the other. Despite Cutter's insistence that Borden uses a double, Angier becomes obsessed with discovering Borden's secret. The rest of the movie follows Angier and his devotion to figuring out the secret to Borden's most popular trick. The climax of the movie is filled with several compelling twists and turns and ultimately some unanswered questions. Overall, this was an above average thriller that was able to incorporate magic in a semi-believable way. SPOILER:",

The ending is sci-fi, but for me, the inclusion of Tesla in the movie leads you to believe the movie to be true...fact based...suspension of disbelief. Teslas free based electricity, destroyed by Edison, makes this movie even more complex, if you have ever studied Tesla. A machine, or obsession that actually creates body doubles....great twist....do not over think it....it is all illusion! Or is it? It is up to you to see if Teslas toy makes new people, and if Bale's character is really Bale or his double. This is what causes the love tragedy of the suicide of his wife, not knowing or believing if he loves her or not. They take turns. Very complex. And Jackmans character actually being a Lord! That's where the limitless money comes in, and his ability to finance such a battle of two men obsessed with being masters of illusion!

The movie has his trademark non-chronological storytelling, which is a little confusing at first, but it actually enhances the smoke and mirrors quality of the film; it unfolds just like how the characters play out their tricks - the pledge, the turn, the prestige. The characters are all tortured and haunted in some way, what started off as friendly competition escalates into an obsessive bitter rivalry where nothing is sacred in order to get the one-up on the other.

Both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are superb in their respective roles as rival magicians in Victorian-era London. I actually had to watch it twice on certain mysterious scenes in order to get the surprise ending. The best part is that there is a sub-plot regarding Nikolos Telsa, the ""Father of Electromagnetism and electrical AC current"", and Thomas Edison on who is the best inventor in the field of electromagnetism. The sub-plot will give the basis on the competition between Jackman and Bale's characters in this movie. I would look for various clues throughout the movie in order to understand the finale.",

I'll start off by being honest that their motives were a bit extreme but it made sense, and toward the end it was getting predictable, but that is because Nolan wanted you to think about the importance to one character that had one line. There are so many parallels in this movie, it depends on the viewer. Who doesn't love a questionable ending?

The most important part of a film is the ending, and the ending in The Prestige was 10 out of 10! I don't know about anyone else but after seeing it for my first time, I popped the DVD right back in and watched it again because I wanted to spot the difference's in the twin brothers. The first time viewing I was confused in scenes where Borden's personality changes throughout, so the second time gave me a whole different look!

The performances are top notch, Hugh Jackman shows us range and emotion that he has not yet displayed on the screen.

Even at the end there was no real good guy or bad guy. No clear moral lesson. The characters and story were kept very human. What I thought might end up a fantastical unbelievable story was very real and even thought provoking. There was only one fantastical element to the film but it was still presented in such a way as to not take away from the characters themselves and the drama between them. The acting was also very impressive. I never doubted the characters for a minute. Not a one. The run time is kind of long. However,unlike Peter Jackson's King Kong I was never bored, never just waiting for the story to pick up.

I have always enjoyed all his movies, whether it was the memorable Memento or the beginning of the new chapter in Batman Begins. But over here, Nolan has managed to portray a fine movie despite making some changes to the original plot by Christopher Priest. Nolan has managed to pull out excellent performances from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. Michael Caine, as ever is, dependable on his role as the sidekick.

1039,24 October 2006,patrickstafford,9," An intense, visually magical, emotionally charged piece of work","The visual experience of this extremely authentic period piece, consummate acting and storyline will leave most earnest moviegoers with a truly exhilarating experience. You expect the leading actors to do something familiar from their other work but they give us new dimensions. Michael Caine again proves his timeless value to the enhancement of any role while David Bowie offers a portrait of elegant, aged sophistication fronting electrical spectaculars, ancient reminders of Ziggy Stardust. Although the film has slower expository moments, the contribution to the grand finale is something to behold. If magic is what you wish for, magic is what you will receive. The name only belies the true ""Prestige"" of the final act. There are facets that make this film watchable with a repetitiveness that will seem tireless. It can and will involve a satisfaction and identification of inner emotions that are played out and identified by all of us. The film can easily define the recently modern terminology ""obsessive-compulsive"" behavior. It also can serve as a guide on the price of success at any cost affecting so many of our fellow human beings today. For those who scrutinize detail, there are scenes of turn of the century London you will find irreconcilable with modern sanitation and relative cleanliness of large cities. The artifacts, apparatus, equipment, and scenery seem to have been crafted with such exact precision as to have been transported from history. The character of Nicola Tesla was real and a real genius overshadowed by Edison; Tesla and elements of his work are still shrouded in mystery to this day. In summation, this movie is magical and a fulfilling treat for those with imagination and the absolute enjoyment of carefully merged fact with unknown possibilities.",

I think I'm going to write to the writers congratulating them on such an EXCELLENT movie. Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Scarlet Johannson, and Michael Caine, did a SUPERB job. They timed everything perfectly, and the emotion was entirely believable. There were multiple quotes that I will remember for a very long time they were just so GOOD! On the drive home after seeing this movie you will just not be able to stop talking about it. Throughout the seemingly serious plot, there are several parts that will just make you laugh out loud. All in all this was a SUPERB movie!! Not one even close to being as good! TWO THUMBS UP!",

1055,2 November 2006,woodyarddavid,9, Great movie,The Prestige is a movie done by the same man who did Memento and batman begins. It is a moderately dark tale of two magicians. I left the movie talking with friends about the intricate plot. Hugh Jackman and Christian bale play their roles superbly. The only fault is the characters not being particularly likable.However you forgive the writers towards the end. Hugh Jackman is very different from his role as wolverine. Anyone who has read the book by Christopher priest would not enjoy it as much. However the book presents an interesting viewpoint to the movie. David Bowie and Andy Serkis are funny. Andy Serkis longs for that cod piece so well known as Gollum's own. This movie i enjoyed because it is a clever roller-coaster ride of emotions. you feel great disgust for Hugh Jackman's character at the end. Him killing himself each night is a fantastic twist and the end part where you see the large amount of boxes filled with Hugh Jackman's body and Michael Caine's narration is fantastic. I felt that Hugh Jackman would be the good guy. And was surprised when he was evil,

1064,3 February 2011,andy-933-696608,8, The Prestige Movie Review,"Are you watching closely? Are your really watching? That's all viewers can do as Director Christopher Nolan takes them into the illusive world of on stage magic, and the very battle unfolded by it's competitors. Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are two stage magicians whose love for the very wonder of the art consumes their very souls, as both take each and every chance to crush the other. Secrets, secrets, and more secrets are revealed from both ends as the two risk life, and even their general morality to come out victorious. Robert, a magician with more showman ship to characterize his title, is consumed more and more with a determination to trounce Alfred, wanting to know every secret of his tricks. Obsession can cause so much damage to an individual, no matter what it is. In Roberts case, his need to succeed, will cost him the very thing a person cannot afford to lose, alive or dead, his soul. Borden on the other hand may not be as charismatic as the American gentleman, but with the natural talent he's been blessed with, it's enough to put a smile on his face, so long as he himself can live with secrets. Whether they're hidden from his family, or his enemies, one thing is for sure, secrets are what define this man, and what further drives Angier towards their competition. Their rivalry began in the wake of Roberts own loss, and what he believed to be Borden's own doing, thus fueling their competition to a more personal level, despite the cost of Borden's fingers for Angier's wife. Alas, the loss of the very woman Angier once loved will no longer torment him, and not at the soft lips of his new beloved Olivia (Johansson), but at the lingering desire to emerge as the victor of this battle. Deception becomes the main theme of this game between the two artists, as they play their cards as cautiously as possible, risking life, reputation, and their own humanity as they further and further get their hands dirty. Angier's need to win, escalates into a 2 year journey that further takes him into the dark world of real magic, the kind of magic that brings people surprise, but further misery as the secrets of that dark nature consume those people. The warnings from the already stained Nikola Tesla (Bowie) were not enough to drive Robert off this very corrupt path. His long stay in Colorado Springs turns out more than what he bargained for, as Angier obtains a device capable of breaking through the illusions and the practicality of stage magic. It's all revealed moments after his death, and within moments of Borden's false conviction. The magic of Angier's triumph over Borden does not stop at his mere sacrifice, oh no. It goes further into revealing the dark secrets of that a very machine. The man declared to be the deceased Robert Angier, was merely a double at the expense of the real Robert's or, Lord Caldlow's expense, as well as his further gain. Borden's only child Jess seemed like the proper bargaining ticket for his tricks and their detailed secrets. Unfortunately the deal is easily broken at the very arrogance of Robert's assured victory, tearing the notes into shreds, merely complimenting his own talent over Borden's as if Borden's sentence or even the very wellbeing of his own child in his tainted hands isn't enough to satisfy him. ""Abara Kadabra"", the common words of any magician are uttered from Borden as his neck breaks and his life ends, leaving this world with one last trick, and one more valuable than the mystery of the transported man. Fallon, Borden's seemingly quite manager, going the whole film without saying 2 words, ends it all with the end of the soulless Robert Angier. It's a climatic conclusion, as it not only ends the film with a terrific twist, but shows Christopher Nolan's dedication to the title of his film. Alfred's twin, capable of playing both parts alongside him, showed the nature as well as the very cost of their good tricks, indulging everyone, friends and enemies in a sense of never ending doubt, curiosity, and even mind wrenching madness that drove one to tainting his soul for the worst, and the other towards the end of her own taken life. Some viewers will believe that the idea of creating a twin brother for a character as deceptive and intelligent as Borden is cheap, but I see it as more of an opportunity to manipulate the nature of this film's theme. ""The Prestige"" revolves around magic, but it deeply explores the factors of the competition between its 2 characters Borden and Angier, and just how far each one went when trying to learn the other's secrets. Borden is a unique character because he lives in the moment of his magic, remaining dedicated to it, despite its heavy costs, while Robert displays the grasp obsession had on him, as his need to defeat Borden clouded his judgment as well as his very purpose for magic. Borden could enjoy the thrill and wonder of his magic, despite the competition he had indulged in himself. Angier, had no limits, he would no longer fear very evil he had done to continue, murder, abduction, and even acts that play the very noble work of God. The films overall them of limits in the nature of rivalry are what truly motivate these characters, and their very persona's, and that mostly what I enjoyed about this film. The direction of the film, as well how certain events in the film are displayed in the pattern of a magic trick. We viewers are each given a pledge and a turn, but the prestige for each one revealed is at a later time, surprising us to the very talent Chris Nolan has shown with both this ecstatic cast and the interesting subjects of obsession and competition.",

The name of the movie, ""The Prestige,"" has nothing to do with the level of prestige involved in the magician's competition; it references the third part of a magic trick. Through the course of the movie, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) attempts to discover the secret to Alfred Borden's (Christian Bale) latest greatest trick. There is a mysterious element to the antics of Borden much like the mysteries in an M. Night Shyamalan film. The plot is very complex, and I found that the plot made much more sense after I was able to discuss it with a group of friends who had also seen the film. One unique feature that I very much enjoyed was the strong lack of distinction in protagonist and antagonist. Rivals Angier and Borden both bring in their own share of criminal acts and charitable deeds. The science techniques employed by the characters in the movie are phenomenal, but completely unexplainable. All in all, this movie really gives the viewer something to chew on.

The prestige, a movie that will bend your back as you desperately try to see the hidden clues that you may have missed earlier on. here's my opinion on the movie. lets start with Huge Jackman. the name says it all. Jackman being Australian slang for bender of minds and back and basically thats what he does in this movie. he is great and really presents a perfect layered performance. you never really understand what he's saying but you get the feeling that he knows what he's doing. it always helps to have the ability to act through understanding and huge has got this. Scarllett Johansun, a great actor, was brilliant in mean girls and certainly has the ability to act and bend minds, but let's just say that the word fugal come to mind when talking about her performance. she knows it and it shows. George Lucas once said that if an actor doesn't want to be in a movie and doesn't believe the magic that they are presenting then it will show on film. George was right. Scarllett doesn't believe in magic and its clear. she never says anything supportive of Huge Jackman or Christin Bale because she obviously doesn't believe in magic. she needs to let herself go more and be free and stop holding onto prejudices of black people and magicians. everyone else in the movie was fine, great even. watch out for the star cameo role (you'll know it when you see it). let's just say that the butler from the nanny named Fran would approve. Anyway, ce'lar vee, a great movie but don't see it coz u probably wont get it at all. PS Huge definitely has a notable bulge in his pants in the opening scene. i think it could help for any Oscar nods. i would give it 8 but that bulge is worth at least a 10 by itself.",

Well I saw the movie the second time tonight and it just hit me, how perfect all the edges and twists come out in the end and perfectly make sense. It is simply brilliant, how the two opponents are not just simply opponents, but as the story unfolds not only do they become the total oppositions of each other, but also turn out to be the almost complete antipode to the characters they started of with, themselves. One had everything and was already complete, but has indefinitely lost it. So now he has to become more to do the trick and be able to live on.

The showing and telling of the simple bird-trick at the beginning and ending of the movie exemplifies this. And we see and hear it in a completely different way then, than we did in the beginning. Because now we simply know. One has to make huge sacrifices, the sacrifice of life, either way! If the world sees/knows or not. It shows on many levels, how obsessions can make us lose everything we have and ever wanted, even if or especially if we can have it all and take it for granted. Over revenge, rivalry and simply over being the greatest magician, ... In the end what does it offer us, staying true to ourselves, our love for our family and friends and as in every relation, the herein literally vital need to communicate everything.",

1099,4 July 2010,mark-whait,8, No illusions as Nolan's piece hits the mark,"The Prestige is a unique thriller that works very well thanks to the slick direction of Christopher Nolan and a terrific contribution by a stellar cast. A movie that revolves around the acts of Victorian magicians is perhaps not at first glance the most obvious backdrop to set the story to, but Nolan delivers a powerful, engaging and compelling piece that is thoroughly enjoyable. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play two rival magicians, who through fate and tragedy, become competitively obsessed with the success of each others' acts. The sense of illusion is perfectly pitched throughout by Nolan, and it even gives the audience a wide appreciation of the world of magic (one almost can't wait to get home a try a few card tricks!). Jackman and Bale are magnificent, and are ably supported by the usual brilliance from Michael Caine. Quite how David Bowie pops up is anyones guess, but the whole movie is well made and will rightly be regarded in years to come as a superior picture.",

On the ride to the movie house you are mistakenly in the frame of mind that what you are about to see will be, in fact, entertaining and watchable. The best part of this film is the ride home for then the most arduous 2 hours spent in a theater in recent time are over. This film explains itself to you via Michael Cain's narrative of the three parts in a Magicians performance: at first an infant mewling and puking in his nurse....wait, thats something different. The First Act is called The Pledge, in which a magician displays an everyday object; act two is The Turn, in which that everyday object is made to do something extraordinary, such as disappear; and act three is The Prestige, in which the object reappears, dazzling an audience too afraid to applaud at the end of act two. The movie basically follows this pattern except The Prestige in this film is not dazzling at all, instead painfully obvious. Anyone who has seen the STTNG Episode ""Second Chances"" will not be in the least surprised. Those who haven't and have a brain in their head will not be. That said, my girlfriend and I were the only two people with brains in their head at the screening we attended. This auditorium was dazzled.

1134,29 January 2010,jorjbr2,10, Absolutely amazing film,"In my opinion this is probably the greatest film I have ever seen, an awesome cast at the peak of their performances. Christian Bale is often referred to as a 'wooden' or 'emotionless' actor, but I blame this on the fact that for a great deal of his films he has to put on an American accent, but during his performance in this film he sticks to a British accent, it may not be his natural one, but it seems to open him up to new emotions that he cannot portray with an American accent. Hugh Jackman is also sometimes ridiculed for his acting, but for this film he doesn't play the mindless, anger-driven wolverine which I feel limited his acting performances, as all he had to do was flex his muscles and shout, but again, this film shows his true potential as an actor and it is truly astonishing. Michael Caine... Well there's nothing to say, you can't go wrong with Michael Caine. Scarlett Johanson, despite being a fairly minor character, was actually quite impressive, particularly with her accent which was spot on, though I felt her character was a bit pointless (other than to keep the gents happy obviously) but that would be a problem I have with the book itself rather than the film adaptation. All of these brilliant actors, each of which I would say providing the best performances of their careers so far, coupled with Christopher Nolan, a director who seems to be able to turn anything into an amazing film, make this film a truly amazing experience, and believe me, you will want to watch it again. 10/10 - my favourite film",

Can we talk about the intricate, subtle, mind-bending way the story was constructed? Yes, it is a little on the challenging side, and that's what makes it great. Anything less would have been boring and predictable. But the writing here kept me guessing and led me in directions I sometimes wasn't prepared for.

Nolan's film flips backwards and forwards through time like he's having a Memento flashback, characters wander across the screen talking about things we can't begin to understand. Locations appear, performances are had, and for a moment I thought I'd misread something and it was actually directed by David Lynch. Not so. Before long things start getting clearer. Bit by bit, everything comes into focus, a gradual process until by its end the film's brilliant, complete picture is crystal clear. To get there, you'll have to earn it. You'll have to hate it before you like it. During it's running time The Prestige will make you irritated, confused, exasperated, frustrated but before it's over... you'll fall in love with it.

1144,17 January 2022,jamesforeman-87634,7, Enjoyed the twists,Enjoyed all the twists of this Nolan film - it's his best film - never understood that awful film inception - but this is a spellbinding film about the explanations behind magic. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play rival magicians with a life long rivalry bent on figuring out the other. Controversy rises when a female apprentice drowns in a tank in a trick that backfired. He previously made a farce of the Batman series in Batman Begins as well as directing the overrated thriller Memento. Here he examines the explanations and challenges of magic with tremendous sets and acts to overwhelm the mind. Jackman is excellent as an accomplished magician out to perfect the transporting act. Bale as the rival is married and has a daughter but spends much time in prison for murder. Scarlett Johansson plays an apprentice of Jackman's sent to achieve Bale's secrets. Finally there is Michael Caine who voices reason and the mystery behind it all. Rebecca Hall plays Bale's wife while Piper Perabo plays the wife of the Jackman character. Nolan is among the most intelligent of directors and seems confident in creating suspense as well as leave audiences guessing but the ending here may be questionable to some if not brilliantly vengeful.,

If you are, like me, a fan of the BBC series Jonathan Creek (detective series where the technical adviser to magician Adam Klaus teams up with a reporter to solve murders using the same method that is behind the magic shows. The adviser is named Jonathan Creek, hence the title) , you will probably think you have to see this movie, but you really don't. It relies on the same logic and tricks as all movies and series about ""magic"" do, although this one has a plot-twist, which by the way, you can see coming if you know how movies usually present such things. I figured the entire movie out in a quarter of an hour, although there remained some blanks in the picture, so I enjoyed the first 1 1/2 hour, but I have to warn you that this movie is cruel with many people getting hurt in many different ways and it is NOT a feel-good movie. Hugh Jackman is brilliant, though, reminded me of Thimothy Dalton (well he calls himself the Great Danton, coincidence? Yes.) And I would give Hugh my Hero of this movie vote, as I believe he is the guy you feel for. That is also why this movie sucks: you can pick either character to be your ""hero"", because well I get the feeling that the editor and director did not really realize you should pick one. This movie shifts between the two lead magicians as bad-guy and hero, which can be fun, but it is not. I left this movie feeling rotten and so did my party. They didn't all get it as fast as I did, so you may be amazed yet. But I'd pick a better movie if I were you, although pickings are slim at this time of year...

This does have some interesting historical tidbits which may spark interest .

Borden (Bale) is in prison for the murder, reading Angier's journal which is quoting a magic tricks book Angier stole from Borden! Huh? Woefully directed by Nolan this great-looking but pretentious mush-mash flashes back, forward, and simultaneous sideways so that without your own story board you won't follow it. But you won't care! This turn of the 19th century atmospheric but odd movie about dueling magicians, their hate for one another, a mystery that binds them, and their growing young art is too uneven. It dwells on the atmosphere and deep-secreted illusions and forgets character development and reality. Is this mess sci-fi or drama-thriller? I say junk.",

After that clues were forced down our throats until I started to believe there had to be a third, more brilliant twist to the story. It never presented itself though. Shame on you Mr. Nolan!

Batman Begins multiplied his fan base, and fired him deep into mainstream recognition with its back to basics, brooding style. Nolan gave Batman the rebirth everyone desired and with it came one of the most widely praised comic book movies of all time. Before cracking on with The Dark Knight, Nolan returned to a project in the making for some time, co-written with his brother Jonathan. Entitled The Prestige the story follows the intense, dangerous rivalry between two turn of the century magicians, adapted from the book by Christopher Priest. After a return to conventional structure with Batman, The Prestige proves a welcome return to the ""What?, Where?, Why?"" syndrome Memento fans embraced. While the timeframe is fractured, the viewer is not plagued with quite the same sense of disorientation; The Prestige is an accessible conundrum of clues and red herrings working together towards the inevitable final grand reveal.",
1166,28 January 2014,samsudean,9, The Prestige,"The film has a pace to it which is satisfying and enjoyable, and it is fast to take off. The complexities of the story are involved from the word go; as the film begins at a stage just moments from the conclusion, when characters have already been defined, and the plot fully explored. It then progresses to the past, and, narrated partially by a friend of the two magicians (Caine), the story of how the men came to be where they have just been shown to have ended up is told. Already, you have been privy to scenes which are, though not entirely understood by you (as the lead-up to these scenes has not yet been viewed); they are still pleasantly electric and exciting. As you start to see more of the past, and to know the characters and their stories, you begin to feel anxious for the future of these people, watching with the fervent hope that all will turn out as it should, but knowing from what you have already seen that this is not so. You are, in this way, captured by the story from the moment it begins - caught up in the suspense of a semi-revealed outcome and the lives and feelings of a multitude of characters. Such interlocking of the story continues throughout the entire film, as flashes of the present are coupled with those of the past, and the truth can only be yearned for.",

When an implausible sci-fi twist comes along and makes the last half hour a great big WTF experience, it can be kind of disappointing. But if you watch it again, you'll see a lot more in it. This isn't just a movie about magic and figuring out how Robert Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) perform their greatest tricks. This is a story about the self-destructive nature of obsession and revenge, and about how you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. The second time through this movie, with a bit of perspective on what it all means, it gets better. You realize the massive sacrifices that Borden and Angier will make in an endless attempt to one-up one another.",

I came out two odd hours later convinced I'd saw the best movie of 2006. I hadn't really heard much word of mouth praise from any friends, and it seemed to have slipped by unnoticed due to the massive PR around Bond (also very good - possibly the best ever) and Borat to a lesser extent, but when the cinema screen filled to capacity on a Monday night after having been out for 6 odd weeks I began to feel like I was in for a treat. It's a funny movie in that they scatter clues all around as it zooms from flashback to present day, and if your paying attention you can start to figure out what's happening, but because there are so many false clues and hints I genuinely had to think for a good hour after the movie as to what happened. Bale and Jackman are phenomenal as lead actors, and draw you into believing who is in the right and who is in the wrong due to their previous character stereotyping.

Of course a good movie doesn't need a plot full of surprising twists, but from the introduction of Fallon early on until the last shot I kept hoping 'please let there be something I am missing'. I was wrong. The first time I saw Fallon, I knew he was a double for 'Borden'. You could easily see it was Bale with a hat, fake nose and hair...Also Sarah's 'today you (don't) love me's made it all too clear. By never showing Fallon's face, or sometimes just plain ignoring him, Nolan made me too curious about him. And it annoyed me. Does Nolan think his post-6th Sense-Fight Club-audience is stupid?",

The sets are incredible, and the snow scene with the lights is a wow...it would be nice to see such a light show in real-life during the Christmas Holidays. Still the movie is slow at times, and yet, still isn't too bad--not great, but acceptable. This isn't a great movie (far from it, OK, way from from it), and at 130 minutes does seem long. I thought the story was good, the dialogue passable---when it could be heard. I don't know if others have noticed this, but it did distract from the movie. Quality of sound should be standard, but in this one, I felt it really go to be annoying at times, as I had to constantly adjust the volume up, down, up,down.",

That is basically what Nolan's masterpiece The Prestige is about. It gives you a perspective of two magicians who were friends at first, but then become rivals. You can support one, or another, but you don't need to support them, you can just watch them go CRAZY. The Prestige is a brilliantly crafted masterpiece. The acting is great with Hugh Jackman and Scarlet Johansson new to the Nolan-Verse. When Christian Bale and Michael Caine return from Batman Begins. I love the direction which shows you how a wonderful childhood experience that is magic, can be full of selfishness. If you ask me, I think Hugh Jackman's character is a better person, but in this case, I think Bale is right although I don't really love either of those characters because they are not designed to be loved. I also love the cameo appearance from the charismatic David Bowie. He acted great and played such a strong character. This is a must-watch for any film fan and I would recommend it to everyone.

The whole plot is contrived. The movie is not compelling as a whole, only in parts. The acting is fine, but the dialog is often hard to follow--lines spoken too quickly and not distinctly. Don't expect a bright and sunny movie either--most scenes are filmed in dark and dingy sets. The movie starts out alright--two magicians competing for the best trick, but soon the plot devolves into a series of events where each main character seeks the ""ultimate magic trick."" Don't be fooled: this so-called ""ultimate magic trick"" is completely implausible, so the movie looses credibility and believability.

Creating this fantasy isn't a satisfying solution to how Jackman was able to do his teleportation act. ""The Prestige"" isn't the sort of movie where the motivations of the characters is enough to carry the plot, as it was in Amedeus. So much of the plot is sprinkled with revelations of magic tricks that I was expecting a rational explanation for Jackman's trick. I don't think anybody can claim this is irrelevant to the plot. Quite frankly the only thing about this story that held my interest was the possibility that the explanation for the trick would be clever.

The central question about ethical behavior around which this movie has been built never seems to be as clear or as easy to answer as the ones all the other movies I have watched have presented to me. The Prestige is build like a ""magic trick"" which consists of three acts itself (genius: The official Trailer tells you more than you could have known). The plot is told from different times and from different angles so that you never really know what is going on till the end. This doesn't necessarily mean that this is good way to tell a story, but Christopher Nolan has perfected this way of telling a plot since Memento. There will be times when you will think that you know exactly what is going on or you know what this movie is about but believe me: You don't. I don't want to spoil anything but if you like any sort of medium that really challenges your mind, you need to do yourself the favor and watch this movie. ""ABRACADABRA!""",

Beautifully done and directed. Indeed Chris Nolan may be one of the worlds greatest directors, like Batman begins was amazing to. Christian Bale does a well done part, and Hugh Jackman is always like his best. But I have to differ with another movie on illusions. The Illustionist. This is another well crafted movie, but it is more simple and reveals all the tricks at the end. Some people I have talked to the Prestige about get confused about this movie. People think that the father was beheaded at the end or was the look alike beheaded (maybe it was his brother??????)But these two movies both show great work and sacrifice in the characters part, and also in the script. Like when Borden and Angier fight the battle of Magic. Compare this scene to the war of the love of the women in Illusionist (Jessica Biel) I have to give both of these movies 8 out of 10 stars because they are both beautifully crafted movies, and have great astonishing actors and actresses. Two thumbs up for both.!!!!!!-Missy",

For this one, for example, I'm not sure is it's his brother who got the idea, but the plot of two magicians engaging a battle for love and attacking each other by magic tricks is simply genius. Who the hell thought about that before, seriously? Great actor performances, stunning hot Scarlett Johansson and plus, he succeeds by making this film in another time of history and get appropriate costumes and landscapes. I think that this fact is a huge plus to any movie, whatever the subject is. It's pretty funny to see Hugh Jackman, who is the Wolverine, playing a total different kind of role, but it's nice to see also that he is a great actor even outside x-men movies, and for Bale, he is definitely getting a bigger place in my esteem for him and I think he is also a great actor.

Another thing I did not appreciate was Scarlett's accent, and maybe it's because i'm a Londoner, but i found it jarring.

Everything unfolds in front of your eyes but you still didn't watch while Nolan amazes you with a new trick from his seemingly inexhaustible bag of tricks. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play the obsessed magician roles perfectly while the cinematography and terrific production values set this mystery drama in Victorian London. One can uncover a few plot flaws on re-watch but that is because you know the secret. Once you know the secret, the magic is nothing.",

Yet as the director of a complex psychological tapestry such as MEMENTO or the character-driven revival of a pop culture knight in BATMAN BEGINS, Christopher Nolan electrifies THE PRESTIGE with the dark mysteries of the human soul which propel these two magicians into chaotic conflict, never once bungling his three-act wonder.",

I became deeply invested in each of the characters, and as for the main duo in specific, I couldn't decide whether to love or hate them, but that I felt the need to do so speaks volumes in of itself. The plot was also excellent, twisting and turning and flowing - until the very end, to explain I'll use an analogy from the movie: the big reveal at the end was like a magic trick the trick of which has been revealed, it loses its appeal, but the problem is that a movie isn't a magic trick, a movie must be able to reveal its secrets, and be all the better for it, and to a certain level, I think that's where The Prestige fails a little.",

I had a good discussion with my friends for a half an hour after just to get what what really happened and we are still not sure if we are right. The movie follows the 3 parts of a magic act. The pledge, at first you think you know whats going on and it seems normal enough but then you get to the second part the turn, here the ordinary become something spectacular and the prestige were you look for the secret but wont find it.

Its NOWHERE near as thrilling as commercials will lead you to believe. The movie is 2 hours, which isn't a bad thing, except for the way the directors seemed to just stretch and stretch the storyline as far as it can possibly go. The story is somewhat hard to understand, because it will sort of flash from the past to the present and you sort of lose track if your not watching closely. I was expecting much more from this movie, so don't get your hopes up too high, especially if your expecting a non-stop thriller.

1245,7 November 2006,Steim-1,6, I guess I expected too much,"I loved the actors in this move. I also love the director. I was, unfortunately, tainted I fear by my viewing of THE ILLUSIONIST, which was a clearly a better film in my opinion. I mention THE ILLUSIONIST for only two reason, reasons that caused me to like THE ILLUSIONIST and made me disappointed in THE PRESTIGE. First least significant was the magic performed: I was far more entertained by the former movie's magic tricks than the latter, which were explained and therefore less magical--even the ""scientific"" tricks, which I will not spoil here. Second and far more important, was the level of intelligence in the plot and the writing of the film. THE PRESTIGE suffered, in my opinion, from twists that become illogical, right to the very end which was obvious to me from the middle of the film. Meanwhile, THE ILLUSIONIST, which again I admit tainted my experience by raising the proverbial bar and challenging THE PRESTIGE, brilliantly revealed incredibly intricate plot motivations and actions that we only figure out at the very ending of the film--though I suspect many viewers will not put all the pieces of THE ILLUSIONIST together even after being handed the details by film's end. In short, THE PRESTIGE was an enjoyable film for high school students and for people who want to see a movie by will not think about what is happening. THE ILLUSIONIST is for college graduates who actually earned their degree. I realize this sounds very snobbish, for which I am sorry. But I am trying to be honest.",

Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine bring incredible performances. One of Christian Bale's best same goes for Jackman. This movie starts out with a bunch of loose ends in the story and gradually these ends are tied and revealing more of the story.

They each have a separate way of drawing you in and making you sympathize with their own struggle. Jackman is a man completely obsessed with finding the secret to Bale's mysterious abilities. Bale, it seems, is only half a man at any given time, sometimes completely engulfed in his magic and illusions, other times he is a warm loving husband and father who just happens to be a magician. Every time Jackman and Bale are on the screen together you can feel yourself pulling to the edge of your seat waiting to see whats next in their quarrel for greatness. Deep and dark secrets lie in both men, but you cant help but wonder who has taken it too far.

1266,14 March 2013,reddevil_42,9, Prepare to be amazed,"Christopher Nolan certainly knows how to make thrilling dramas with loads of interwoven plot points amalgamating into an inextricable storyline. In a way, the movie was one act of magic itself comprising of a pledge, a turn and the prestige of its own. The final voice over of the movie indeed leaves the viewer smiling because he does not want to give too much thought to the intricacies of the plot and wants to be fooled. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman were both great in their portrayal of a spiteful relationship between two magicians,comprising of continuing acts of one-upmanship and revenge. Michael Caine does what he does best. He acts as the viewer's guide to the movie, moving the plot along and presenting the lesser known facts that lie below the surface. Scarlett Johansson looks oh so desirable in the movie showcasing her grace and her voluptuous figure as an assistant to the magicians who unknowingly gets involved in an unpleasant tussle between the two. The inclusion of the AC vs DC argument between Tesla and Edison is something that the science lovers would relish. Both Andy Serkis and David Bowie act as rather mysterious caretakers of the science side of the movie and indulge into it only as per requirement of the plot. In summary, when people go out for a movie, they wish to be enthralled, to be shocked and to be entertained during those two hours and The Prestige (in general, all of Nolan's works) serves them all of this and more.",

I think that in real life that would be the first thing one would check to see what went wrong with a trivial trick - especially because it has been an issue between them. But certainly a highly entertaining movie, with great acting, beautiful pictures, and a catching storyline. Like ""The Departed"" it is a movie one can watch over and over again and still enjoy for it's many twists and cleverly situated clues. The mind-blowing experiment with electricity which is accredited to Dr Telsa, is symbolically destroyed by Edison.

In this dramatic thriller Alfred Borden (christian Bale) and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) try to discomfit each other in becoming the better magician. Robert Angier started off as brilliant as Berenice but then towards the end of the film became malefic. You will descry shocking conclusions about these characters. The complex plot twist makes this film even better in a way that leaves you wanting more. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman did a fabulous job playing their roles.The way how everything is filmed just compels you. You may have to watch the movie again to have a truly better understanding of what has happened. I strongly recommend this brilliant film.""Abra Cadabra"" -tasha",

1278,28 February 2007,subramanian-k13,4, a huge let-down,"Coming from the director of 2 gripping movies in Memento and Batman begins,""The Prestige"" is a complete let-down.The story line is very thin and plot revealed at the end makes it look like a joke.It might precisely been his intention-to explain ow ludicrously simple magic tricks are-but then I wouldn't want to spending 2.5 hours of completely non-sensical attempts of sabotage(some of them had me in guffaws at the ridiculous stupidity of it all)only to find I was being taken for a ride all along. I can't help feeling he has tried to make a simple narrative needlessly complex trying to give psychological connotations to the entire story, and ""going back and forth in time"" stuff-which was completely unnecessary. Clearly he's suffering from ""Memento"" hangovers. At least,a genuine attempt at character development would have ensured that the magicians mind connected with the audience but sadly that was not to be.At times, I wondered if I was watching a comedy movie gone wrong or genuinely made to go wrong.Performances too are ordinary.Only thing that saves the movie are the few moments of good direction,good visuals and not to forget,the magic tricks that are demystified!",

Can we so easily confide in the apparent, aren't we the ones who let ourselves being fooled in the skillful illusion of the hidden and unknown. And when someone gives us a hint for that trick where the disappeared comes back we find the prestige of human's mind. Like a great magician Christopher Nolan makes the pledge, takes the turn and hand us the prestige. My total favourite. The flick is wonderfully engrossing mystery. That's the magic trick of the cinema- it spellbind you from the very beginning. I loved it to death. I want to see it again.",

His movies especially the endings, he always leaves them for interpretations leaving you talking and talking about them. The Prestige is a story about two rival magicians trying to find each other's secrets. The themes are strong in this film such as rivalry, obsession, love, commitment and sacrifice. The secret in this film is the dialogue. You have to pay complete attention otherwise you miss out. It's well-acted, well-directed, excellent dialogue and well crafted. What else can you say about Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan, there are geniuses. A+ Film",
1288,16 November 2022,tommyrodgers-77675,6, Spectacularly........mediocre,"There is not too much to say about this film and I believe that speaks the most about the story as a whole. Throughout the movie, tension does continue to build but by the midway point it seems to taper off and really falls flat by the climax. I think that once the element of fictional magic (teleportation) is entered into the story, the intrigue and wonder died. What makes a magicians performance so impressive is that he has done something that you know is possible, but has made it appear impossible. In this movie, the magician has done something that the viewer knows is impossible, which thus makes it not impressive. The only twist/impressive magical trick that occurs was the hidden act between the twin brothers, but other than that, this movie was quite uninteresting and distastefully predictable in almost every aspect.",

Christian Bale was incredible and unforgettable as an overly eccentric magician(s). It was also one of the best performances from the Powerhouse known as Hugh Jackman . i just saw this movie last night and let me tell you, this movie had me guessing the whole time because usually you could predict the plot of the move but not this time,twist over twist over twist... this is one of the few movies ever made the keep on shocking you, also the ending is probably better than any movie from 2000-present and no lie. some people say that there is no hero but once you see this movie, you will understand because greed, pride and obsession are the key factors so if you miss the movies that have a bang for your buck, after all Jack & Bale effect..... can't leave..",
1294,8 January 2007,dryspell000,10, The Prestige is a smart twist on the vengeance angle,"The Prestige uses visual excitement,through magic tricks, to keep you interested,but the story line is also magical.

Gosh, it was great to see a movie that can be watched over and over, and grow better each time you see it. The book, which was re-released and is the same copy written in 1975. It is nothing like the movie(though the book story is good), but the screen play writers need to be commended on their ability to take a small concept from the book and change it into the wonderful story they created.

Actually, from the very beginning, the screen script has all told us how the two trick were played. Change the cage and bird into the box and magician, then there comes the answer. I am shocked by the skills used by Nolan, a genius director. Every magic trick consists of three parts, or acts. The first part is called ""the pledge."" The magician shows you something ordinary. The second act is called ""the turn."" The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it into something extraordinary. But you wouldn't clap yet, because making something disappear isn't enough. You have to bring it back. This movie also taught me that if I want to do something very hard, I must have my own way and prepare for it for a long time which is also seen in the movie ""Now You See Me.""",

1301,24 November 2006,Powerslave-4,8, The audience likes to be fooled,"As sportsmen say, reaching the top is not the toughest part, but maintaining oneself there. Each new prestigious movie director can say so, and Christopher Nolan is no different. After Memento's clamorous success, in 2000, he's achieved great prestige among filmmakers and the audience. Nonetheless, some disappointing pictures, such as Insomnia and Batman Forever, made his prestige to be questioned. Recovering credibility is a demanding job, and Nolan's The Prestige managed to bedazzle the audience again. As Truffaut once said, cinema is the art of deceiving. Nothing is real, as well as in magic, when the audience is intensely pleased to be fooled. Knowing that, Nolan used magic as the main ingredient of his tasty recipe. And the utterly irresistible result is completed with a mix of great actors (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as protagonists, plus the terrific supporting roles performed by Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie), realistic costumes, gloomy photography and a powerful direction. Not even the presence of the element ""Deus ex ma china"", a Latin phrase used to describe an unexpected, artificial, or improbable character, device, or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction or drama to resolve a situation or untangle a plot, has managed to spoil The Prestige's magic. If you want to be thrilled by the duel of two men willing to prove who were the best of their professions at that time, this is your call. And don't worry, it's okay to be fooled.",
1302,11 March 2007,SyMaster20,4, Horrible Except For,"This has to be the year's worst film. An utter discombobulated mess. The acting hear is so bad it is mind-boggling. Michael Caine turns in perhaps his worst performance as some sort of wizard or something to that effect. Christian Bale is equally putrid in his role as one of the feuding magicians, this film makes absolutely no sense and its shocking failure is augmented pathetically by worst of all, Hugh Jackman. A clearly homosexual man being tormented by his crushing demons, he can't seem to get his mind focused for a second on his role as the second feuding magician. Christopher Nolan once again proves to be one of the worst and gratuitously artsy directors. This film fails miserably as anything but a pure pile of rubbish. Michael Caine has completely tarnished his legacy with another unfocused, unnecessary role. One bright spot is Scarlett Johansson however lifting this film all the way to a 4 from a 1 with her sheer beauty and pure excellence, reaffirming her status as the world's most talented actress.",

This film is no masterpiece such as Nolan's ""Memento"" but has many enjoyable qualities. The acting is for the most part superb with great performances by Michael Caine, Jackman, Bale and most surprisingly David Bowie as the mysterious ""Tesla"". Though this may be an enjoyable movie it sure as hell does not deserve to be on the top 250. Only due to ""fanboys"" of Nolan did this movie make the top 250 and that is pitiful. People should not rate a movie because they are infatuated by the director or his earlier work.

Even though it's a Nolan movie and it had actors like Christian bale and Michael in the cast the story looked pretty simple and this would just be a fun movie to watch. I was so wrong. This movies plot is way more dense that what the trailers and promotions show. The acting is perfect and the writing and direction are as good.

1310,26 November 2011,mvedprakasha,8, The Prestige: A critique on the concept of movie,"I conceive that the any movie as a matter of fact can become successful if its core is a concept. Its a movie pertaining to human behaviors who are interested in becoming successful by following an idealism. whenever two persons fighting to achieve a single idealism finds it hard to find the secrets of that idealism, or he wrongly interprets the idealism, then he reaches a stage of perverted mind set. Even in this movie Hugh Jackman though right in presenting himself as a magician, making illusions, he goes wrong by losing his ""prestige"" both in show as well as in understanding the idealism. In spite of Mr.Cutter's immense knowledge of the trick, Jackman does not believe his words. The human behavior is to keenly know what others are doing and do the same either steal or copy or pull their legs for the self raise. But when it satisfies the extent of challenging the nature, nature or the destiny makes sure that it will always exist by destroying the unnatural one. The story has a nice balance and surprise maintained till the climax designed by Director Mr.Nole. The story also depicts how two mental status under a single guidance(teacher) turning into two rivals because of business and PRESTIGE issues. Prestige when exceeds the desires and ambitions of winning the others at the cost of challenging the nature, though nature looses some of its very needy part, does not hesitate to destroy the artificial existence. All that we need to remember is :- Anything Great deserves Sacrifice.",

I predict Best Supporting nominations for Michael Cain and Scarlett Johansson. Best Actor nod for Hugh Jackman and Best Picture nomination. I went in at the urging of my wife and was incredibly captivated with this saga. I never knew what ""The Prestige"" meant (or is), but was slowly drawn into it's full meaning through the skillful writing and the expert acting and staging of this period piece of art.

1314,26 April 2013,the-zombie-pirate,8, Too much in some ways,"I really enjoyed this movie because of the craftsmanship and intriguing story/characters. The performances and scenery are top notch. The directing and story telling were intricately and skillfully made. The story is rather tragic, so don't watch this one to be uplifted. The shortcomings of this movie are: 1) It is too intricate. The scenes are out of sequence jumping around from recent past to years past to present without any blatant cues as to the time period. It took me about ten minutes or so to get a feeling for the jumps. Once I got a feel for how they were indicating the time, I was able to lose myself in the movie, however, the others who were watching it with me had a hard time. If you are someone who has trouble with flashback, you probably will not enjoy this movie for this reason alone. Although, I think that they did a very good job in this aspect, it will probably alienate many viewers through confusion. 2) This is not really a scifi story, yet it has scifi which I think detracts from the story. They could have easily written it without any scifi at all and I think that it would have been a more satisfying and interesting story. Throwing in a little bit of scifi unexpectedly and using it as a significant plot device at the very end of the story ruined my suspension of disbelief. There are so many puzzle pieces to assemble regarding the characters' actions, motivations, and secrets that throwing this curve ball in at the end detracts from the effect that they had worked so hard to achieve. This movie is about characters and intrigue rather than fanciful technologies.",

""The Tower"" is beautiful to look at, elegantly filmed, with very good performances across the board. There are multiple story-lines (too many, really) and a big cast of intersecting characters (its literary source-material is evident in the adaptation). At its best, ""The Tower"" shows what life felt like to those who lived at that singular time, to those who dozed ""pitifully and apathetically"" in an unchanging political system before the rules changed, seemingly overnight.

But one of them is an element of the film that will probably be ignored by most other reviewers so I feel the need to underline it: David Bowie in this movie did the unbelievable. He performed a character who is *more* conventional in every possible way than he himself is. The way he found to totally camouflage his own outstanding (exceptionally weird) self and to invoke an entirely different self who beamed a totally different intensity is ...obscure to me. Astoundingly artful.,
