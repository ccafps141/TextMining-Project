2,8 February 2018,jbbianchino,10, Forget Disney! We have movies like Your Name.,"Your Name is just a good movie. This movie felt long, but not too long. All the way through, I was asking what would happen next. It was clever, emotional, and left me crying after the movie. The twist was done really well, and I almost wanted to pause the movie. Also, the animation is gorgeous. You get to see detailed images from many angles and perspectives, and there were hundreds of animators! The credits didn't start out with the cast like it usually would. The first thing you saw after a black screen was hundreds of names of animators and designers. I watched this movie again and I still felt my muscles ready to let tears out. I would not recommend this movie any less than the next guy, so what are you waiting for? Get a couple of friends and watch Your Name!",e
3,10 November 2017,Tweekums,10, Your Name,"This delightful Japanese animation follows two strangely interlinked lives; Mitsuha, a high school girl living in a rural area of Japan, and Taki, a similarly aged boy in Tokyo. They have never met but they somehow start switching places in their dreams. At first each thinks they are having strange but very realistic dreams but the following day as the 'dream' fades they are surprised when friends and family tell them that they had been behaving oddly the day before; not recognising anybody and not knowing where they are meant to be then each finds a note from the other. They continue to swap days until suddenly it stops Taki can't recall many details but he has a memory of the place Mitsuha lived and is drawn to find her. Armed with a sketch of the location he finds the village and learns a shocking truth it had been destroyed in a natural disaster three years previously and Mitsuha was amongst the five hundred people who died! He is determined to find a way to swap places again so he can save her.",v

13,12 March 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8," Wistful, poignant and ultimately uplifting; beautifully animated and wonderfully inventive.","There's a distinct and slightly jarring protagonist switch just far enough in for you to really notice it, but it's a testament to 'Your Name (2016)' that - though it could have been ironed out relatively easily with some structural smoothing or a slightly simpler two-handed approach - this is perhaps its only real issue and it isn't even all that detrimental, considering that it allows us to develop a proper emotional connection to both leads from an internal perspective, actually mirroring the fantastical conceit driving the beautifully animated and wonderfully inventive narrative. The piece is a joy to watch and takes a number of turns that are genuinely unexpected. It's a wistful, soulful and poignant experience that's also an entertaining and, ultimately, uplifting one. It does seem to say something quite profound while always managing to delight and mystify with its deftly handled story and properly stirring themes. 8/10",0

22,7 April 2017,kraytdragon-sean,10, Your Name Please!,"Your Name is a lively combination of romance, identity, and culture. I went into the film with a very little understanding of the plot's complexities. From the trailer, I assumed Your Name would be an anime Freaky Friday love story. The framework of the narrative certainly fits into my initial assumption. Yet, there is a multitude of undercurrents in the film which make Your Name stand out. For starters, Your Name constantly changes themes and mood. Often, I found myself laughing and, a few minutes later, would suddenly be on the verge of tears. The movie's eclectic flow makes for a constantly engaging experience. The Freaky Friday element is roughly half of the film's two-hour runtime. In fact, a plot twist in the film literally took my breath away. Your Name is the rare film which combines overwhelming variety and makes everything fit organically. Through variety, the anime earns a conventional ending between protagonists, Mitsuha and Taki. While body switching is the plot's main intrigue, the film adds complexity through its exploration of Japanese culture. Japanese gender identity is explored with such a masterful hand. In subtle strokes, the viewer understands the sheer contrast in the lives of Japanese men and women. For example, a group of men have a crush on a female co-worker; Mitsuha, in Taki's body, simply initiates conversation with the desired woman and, with ease, sets up a date. When Taki is back to normal the next day, his male coworkers all line up disgusted by his act of group betrayal. The scene effectively demonstrates the strength of the herd like quality of gender in Japan. It's no surprise then when Taki, in Mitsuha's body, finds such humorous wonder in the breasts he suddenly gains. A contrast can also be noticed in the struggle between the past and present. The present is Taki's experience of Tokyo. Likewise, the past is illustrated by Mitsuha's familial duty to her small town's local shrine. In other words, the film merges Japanese spirituality with modern sensibilities. A desire to escape and return to the country define the film's ecliptic take on Japan. Mitsusha is your typical country girl with a thirst for a life in the city. Meanwhile, Taki finds beauty in Mitsuha's country town. The viewer amusingly experiences each setting (Tokyo and Itomori) through the unique lens of the protagonists. Ultimately, a comet and local god guide the distant figures into a surprising collision course. As a result, fate is sealed by the two somewhat metaphysically dissimilar sources. The forces of science and divinity augment Your Name into making the seemingly fated connection all the more plausible. The film is a testament of the ""opposites attract"" sentiment. In summary, the film has a real beating heart. I will end my review saying Your Name is the best looking animated film I have ever seen. The colors are always pleasingly vibrant. Additionally, all of the scenes are lovingly rendered and pulsating with life. I haven't walked out of a theatre with such a positive perspective on life in a long time. If you live in a city, you ought to take the time to experience this anime masterpiece.",_

Of course I've seen most of the Ghibli films but that's pretty standard even for a normie like me. In terms of Makoto Shinkai I hadn't seen a whiff before I saw Your Name (Kimi no na wa). However this one reached such an unsual amount of praise and attention compared to other anime films that even I got curious after some time. Could this movie be worth all the hype? Could it appeal even to someone relatively unversed in anime? ",

Although providing an entertaining fantasy first act revolving around the pair's body-swapping, it takes a good fifty minutes for the film to develop into something truly great.

39,9 September 2016,mushroompaper,10, It clutched my heart the entire way,"This was absolutely amazing... the trailer made it seem like a stereotypical ""boy meets girl, etc."" story... but from the beginning to the end, the movie rotated from a past and present time-line, only proving in the end that time itself was twisted the entire movie - giving us viewers an extremely well written and original plot. The chemistry between the characters, development, music, pacing, animation, everything was absolutely in chorus in the most beautiful way. I cannot even compare this to Studio Ghibli films, not because it's better or not as good, but because it is just a movie of its own caliber. Studio Ghibli films were a lot more fictional, fantasy, and imaginative - free formed and had its own flow. Kimi no Na Wa was cleverly planned out from the first minute to the last, logical, balanced, yet just as if not more breathtaking.",

43,25 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9," Your Name is phenomenal, so close to perfection.","Suffice to say I used to hate anime, I couldn't get on board with it. Now that I feel I've grown as an aspiring film critic, I can appreciate the delicate art of Japanese animation. With Hayao Miyazaki retired, is the genre deceased? Far from it. Your Name is just as good as any Miyazaki production. Two teenagers unexpectedly switch lives, forging a connection that is both unexplainable and unforgettable. Having figured out what's happening, the two attempt to meet...but not everything in life is that simple. A gorgeous juxtaposition of culture and gender. A country girl and a city boy. A tranquil and picturesque rural town against a bustling and modernised Tokyo. Contrasting the difference in mannerisms and punctuality, not just in lifestyles, but in gender. How a girl and a boy interact with others differently. Two lives being thrown into a foreign environment. The sheer complexity and magnitude that the narrative conveys is nothing short of genius. The introductory title song plays and BAM...I was captivated instantaneously. The animation...the animation!? It was like watching art move right before my eyes. Anime has never looked so beautiful. The glistening water, fast moving transport, hallucinogenic comets against a starry backdrop...wow. Wooooow! I can't. It's too much. I think my eyes are bleeding, someone pass me a tissue. Shinkai's direction was utterly creative. The story moves along at a swift pace and the inclusion of time-bending realities just makes it that much more intriguing. It's a love story. How love can traverse both space and time. Honestly, it was beautiful to watch. To create a pure relationship from two souls switching bodies is...well damn difficult. Shinkai made it look easy. Some of the time-bending narrative shifts can be confusing and you may not necessarily understand it in one viewing (heck, I didn't completely) but the film is that good, that you will want to watch it again...and again...and again. Aside from some exposition, Your Name is masterful.",

47,18 February 2018,Horst_In_Translation,8," A big success in terms of visuals, audio and story","""Kimi no na wa."" or ""Your Name"" is a Japanese anime movie that premiered in 2016 already and it took until now, early 2018, to make it to Germany, but the waiting was worth it. Writer and director here is Makoto Shinkai and this was his 5th full feature movie I believe and judging from the quality, I am not surprised that he is considered the next Miyazaki by many, even without the contribution of Studio Ghibli here. This was really a beautiful watch. It runs for 105 minutes approximately and takes us into the lives of a Japanese male teenager living in Tokyo and a female teenager living in the countryside. With a comet approaching Planet Earth, these two seem to be switching mind and bodies as a consequence of their dreams. This results in some pretty funny moments early on, but adds considerable gravity to the whole story the longer the film goes on, at least starting that very moment when we find out how they are not living during the exact same time. So it is a definitely a drama movie, even if Shinkai did really fine in using several established approaches to get in comedy too like the recurring boob humor that is executed so thoughtfully that it works very well and never feels cheesy or even offensive, then the scenes in which we see how female characters can get interested in something so enthusiastically or also thought process of recent mentions in a way you see on Family Guy, but in anime style of course.",

53,1 April 2018,framptonhollis,5," a sweet, mindbending, and all around great animated film","From the crystal clear, beautifully crafted animation to the likability of the two protagonists to the tense drama to the light humor, this semi-love-story is lighthearted and very moving to the point of now being one of the most acclaimed films of recent years. And perhaps one of the most acclaimed films of all time. I had a couple of little problems w/it, thus making me avoid any statements about the film's status among cinema's finest efforts as they'd be rather hyperbolic coming from me, as well as simply just not genuine. Instead, however, I will happily praise the film on various levels. 
 As a technical achievement, it is stunning. The animation is spectacularly done in every scene, the characters are really alive, the scenery is beautiful, in general it is just a really fun movie to look at. There were a few surprisingly surreal and borderline psychedelic moments here and there in the film and they worked not only to further the plot but also to simply show off the massive tons of talent pouring itself into basically every shot of this movie. 
 Story-wise, it is also stunning. It's a mixture of a few genres. At first, it almost feels like some light slice-of-life type comedy w/a magical-realist twist, but eventually it becomes something much more emotional and dramatic than that. It becomes a film featuring multiple dimensions and complicated situations these two leads who I genuinely grew to adore and care for had to trudge their tense ways through. It is a supernatural drama and a love story on top, and a very unconventional love story at that (the way the romance of the film is handled is unlike almost any other romance I have seen; it is clear these two are in love, but they never express it openly at all). It really felt like the writer really matured over the course of writing this, which is as much a blessing as it is a curse, b/c it does mean that the film improves heavily w/every scene, but it also means that the beginning and early middle of this film are no where near as great as what follows. And, do not get me wrong, there's some super fun stuff in this roughly-first-half of the movie, but there's also a few eye rolling scenes and weird incorporations of pop songs and overtly expository dialogue and non-endearingly cheesy moments that I just could not get into. Thus, my score drops down by a single point. It is still, obviously, a wonderful movie, and sort of a must see for lovers of animation and world cinema in general.",

The visuals are fabulous, literally not one single bad shot. The soundtrack was absolutely moving and fits soooo well. The characters are of course brilliant and are the one of the key parts of the movie, they have such strong chemistry between one another but are unable to fully show it as they cannot meet. This get even more challenging towards the end where it just keeps getting better. The plot, omg, was so good. Every piece is split at the start and is connected at the end.

The plot starts out fairly generic, but takes a twist in the middle that rescues it from ho-hum mediocrity and transforms it into something greater. It's very Japanese, in that both main characters speak in rapid-fire bursts, enunciating their every thought in a dreamy, poetic monologue, which alternately works for it and against it. There's a level of spirituality and self-discovery, too, that's left silent but constantly present, and a message about how important it can be to get in touch with the male and female aspects of our personality. Beautiful on many levels, not the least of which is its raw visual splendor. It's one of the most staggeringly lovely animated films I've ever taken in, stealing my breath with almost every scene; in many cases, I cursed myself for not speaking fluent Japanese because my eyes spent so much time on the subtitles. Both the rustic landscapes of a small, classical Japanese village and the crawling steel chaos of downtown Tokyo are fantastically rendered, sharing both a stunning aesthetic and a sense of warmth and familiarity by the closing scenes. A fresh, wonderful, touching tale with a little something for everyone, I'd dare to rank this with many of Studio Ghibli's finest.",

I love how the characters change for the better after knowing each other Mitsuha became more confident and serene thanks to him and Taki became more empathic and calm thanks to her they're both opposites still they complete and elevate each other, a beautiful illustration of what love should be. already a classic and I don't get the Oscars snub!",
79,5 June 2020,baharuka,7, It's okay but not THAT good.,"The movie was clearly made to be on big screen and make everyone averagely happy. The animation and emotion? I expected much more of Makoto Shinkai who was behind the art of the opening and trailer of Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two. That was stunningly beautiful animation and storytelling! Instead, you can find a more generic style in this one with loads of anime and drama/romance clichés: Cute and generic sounding voice actors? Check! Older and cool character who smokes? Check! Bad parent? Check! Wise and cute grandma? Check! Not-that-beautiful best friend? Yes! I could go on...""I'm adding shrine culture and craftsmanship!"" was also there big time. One thing that was totally absent for me was that the romance between the characters was based on...nothing.
The soundtrack reminded that of a big screen American animation but sung in Japanese. It sounded musical-like and childish at times. Plot was average to a higher level of average. It's a body-swap movie as one can see in the trailer and that's been done a lot before. However, there's a good twist which made me enjoy the movie a lot in the end, combined with other elements of the second half. I'd recommend watching on in case the first half doesn't do the trick for you. All in all, not a masterpiece or anything but watchable.",

87,25 April 2020,w-71474,6," I don't like it very much, the plot is very common","There are many highlights. Unfortunately, after shaking off the burden, the core turned out to be an old stalk of a vulgar and hypocritical girl in love. The last subway interlaced to recognize what really made me stale. The so-called ""your name"" is terribly overworked, and it is embarrassing in the end. ""Qian and Qianxun"" also talked about ""your name"". Qianxun was forced to erase his name and became Xiaoqian. Xiaobailong retrieved her name. The meaning of the name here is a positioning and return to self-existence, a reflection on the question of essence and ontology of ""who am I"". And ""Your Name"" doesn't say anything, it is a pure girl love anime movie, and it deliberately consumes the girl's heart. The gap is so great that I can't compare the two movies.
On feelings about nature and tradition, they disappeared completely in the later period, and they were top-heavy. Instead, they felt indifferent. Not to mention comparing with Hayao Miyazaki. No matter which movie Miyazaki made, he never deliberately portrayed the feelings of men and women, but none of the men and women is not impressive. Parker and Hida in ""Sky City"", Little White Dragon and Chihiro in ""Thousand and Thousand Seeking"", ""Hall's Moving Castle"" and Hal and Sophie, etc.
Even if it is the emotion and description of the town, compared with ""Little Forest"", it can see a huge gap. After all the scenes turned to Tokyo, the town did disappear.
On the love of girls, it is not as good as ""The Girl Who Traveled Through Time and Space"". The flirty sentence ""I am waiting for you in the future"" is more touching than this repeated deliberate ending. On dog blood hypocrisy, it is not as good as ""My Girls' Generation"", at least hearty, sweet and sweet. ""Your Name"" used the safety of life in a small town to accompany the two to fall in love. It was really depressing. This is too deliberate, too hypocritical, and too hypocritical. Probably I am not young enough.
In the final analysis, the expectations are too high. As far as the films directed by Xin Haicheng are indeed, they are much better than those of the movies he had before, but they should be as good as possible. The Chinese public is too easy to be pleased, and a little jokes are enough to satisfy. A bit of flirtatious sex teasing will make you happy for a long time. In fact, the whole movie's laugh point is almost supported by touching the chest. Maybe it's been a long time since I saw a good-looking anime movie in love. But really, I would rather watch ""Listening to the Ear"" a hundred times. If it's just about falling in love, then have a good time and do so many tricks. Even if you focus on the theme ""I've been looking for someone ... we all had an adventure, met someone I liked, but just forgot his / her name"", it's better than a hodgepodge in the end.",

I thought both Mitsuha and Taki were such interesting characters like it was bizzare that the pair of them were swapping bodies. Yet we still don't know why they were chosen and I mean thanks to Taki, he saved Mitsuhas life for being in her body and alerting everyone that the town is having a meteor attack. Although I felt sorry for him for not getting through to her self absorbed mayor of a father and then him turning off the alarms. Seriously he's a pure jack*ss in this anime lol!",

Since then, I have tasted a few dozen anime films. But I had never seen a movie like Your Name.
The concept of the film is amazing. The film manages to entertain as well as inform. The story is extraordinary. This is a visual treat for the eyes. The film is more than perfect in emotion, story, character development, camera work and visuals. Though i want to praise this film I'm out of word.",

Kimi No Na Wa is a wonderful masterpiece with a fun and emotional story between two young people who don't even know each other, but have a strong bond. The comedy is very subtle and the plot becomes quite deep as it always is in these Japanese productions. The animation is quite beautiful, with an excellent balance of 2D drawing and digital animation. Visually it is clearly a work of art and the character designs are also admirable. Kimi No Na Wa is definitely one of the best animated movies ever and a gem of Japanese animation. My final rating for this movie is 10/10.",

I was also very pleased with the ending. I'm not going to spoil anything, but i know how much a bad ending can ruin an entire film, so I'll just say that you'll be satisfied.

I felt completely drowned by the visuals and the music. (I actually paused the movie in order to search for an option to silence the music and only hear the dialogue, to no avail. Perhaps I would have liked the movie more if I could have accomplished this.) I was desperate for meaningful dialogue and deeper character development. If you are interested in anime you'd be better served to watch the following: Ponyo, A Letter to Momo, When Marnie Was Here, The Secret World of Arrietty, Vampire Hunter, Howls Moving Castle, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, Castle in the Sky, Princess Mononoke, and My Neighbor Totoro; to name a few.",

Don't want to spoil this for anyone at any cost but my heart sank after a long long time. I think I resonated a lot with the characters. Their agony, their pan and helplessness. It broke something in me. I loved this movie. The characters were written perfectly and yes not that cliché. It wad lovable and pretty and I don't know about others but I really really connected with the plot. I have lost my true love so I know what it means to feel that pain.

That's what happened when I watched Your Name. At first I just liked it because I had to constantly read the subtitles and understand the plot. But later on, I watched it for a second time, and started paying attention to certain details, like the animation, the performance of the voice actors, the likable characters, Japanese culture, but the best and most impressive one of all is the music by Radwimps. Their songs go so well in every scene in this movie, especially ""Sparkle"" in the final moments of the film. And that is one of the main reasons as to why this movie is a ""Masterpiece"" in my eyes. This movie is without a doubt the best animated film of all time, with Spirited Away a close second.

The film is interesting showing the difference between a Tokyo boy and a girl living in the countryside, highlighting the difference of sex and in lifestyle but still being very structured, each having its sequences. The film takes on a very interesting dramatic appearance when the boy (Taki) looks for the girl (Mitsuha) and realizes that 3 years separates them as they ""exchange"" at the same time and the film becomes even more interesting, the whole completed by music of great art.

The body swap genre is one that has been explored in various films, but the way it was intertwined with a love story in Your Name is brilliant. What sets this film apart is its refusal to hold the audience's hand. The first act is dedicated to determining what exactly is going on, and this ambiguity only serves to make the movie better. The final act is incredible, with high stakes and quiet moments that help the audience process the intense emotion the characters are experiencing.

183,4 July 2017,Skaigear,9, This film is simply a masterpiece in storytelling that has everything you want in a romance.,"Your Name is a Japanese animated film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai, based off his own novel of the same name. I was reluctant to watch this movie at first because besides the works of Studio Ghibli, I am not the biggest fan of anime. However, Your Name was making waves around the internet, with people considering it the best anime movie of all time. I am someone who is naturally gravitated towards hype, and with expectations leveled, and my mind opened, and I went ahead and saw the film. And boy, when the credits rolled, I was stunned, mesmerized and enchanted with just how beautiful this movie was in every way. My relationship with anime does not extend beyond Ghibli films, first few seasons of Pokémon and JRPG cutscenes, the reason being I always feel Japanese animation lacks gravitas and instead replaces it with heavy- handed over-the-top storytelling and voice acting. I was glad to see Your Name not succumbing to any of those tropes, in fact, Your Name being an animated film, was able to make laugh, cry, feel anxious and fulfilled all within 90 minutes, something most live-action movies with real actors cannot even dream of trying.

Maybe just like the movie, anime can also dream for us, maybe we will never reach the world of the second element, but only this hopeless and unavailable feeling is the most moving!
As a form of anime, ""Your Name"" does bring me the feeling that other films are difficult to convey. Man is a contradictory complex, which is what can be brought to us through those unique works.
Even though love and thoughts may be so rare in real life, we will still keep searching because I believe it will exist. Looking for that particular person in a huge city, and the name that I have forgotten but lingered in my heart, two tiny individuals connected by knots beyond time and space, this thought will still exist forever.",

However, after the relationships were developed, the two main characters were familiar enough with each other to start to really become friends the switching stops. Upset, the main male protagonist seeks her out. Only to find that she was killed in an asteroid attack 3 years earlier.

The plot may have been inspired here and there but it's something completely new in it's entirety. The scenery and art style is very dreamy and make me wanna go to japan. Also the soundtrack is very fitting and adds to the atmosphere although some people might be annoyed by the japanese singing, but it's a japanease movie playing in japan so what are you expecting? There might be some logical holes that make you think like: ""Hm, why didn't they just do this instead? That would've been much easier"" but it's nothing major so if you aren't even paying close attention to the story, you might even notice. Another problem with this movie is thar there are many time-lapses which probably explains why many of the bad critics are complaining about the sudden romace between the characters. It didn't quite come clear when and how they fell in love due to the shortness of the movie and the timelapses where they probably got closer. Without these negative critic points I'd rate it 10/10. All in all it is a great romantic movie with a twist that is very emotional and hypnotizes with its atmosphere that is created by the lovely and detailed art style and the music. You can't watch this movie coldhearted and with a negative attitude towards japanese animations or you'll miss out on its magic. Thank you for reading!",

I can only remember vague things like how would one prepare a meal or how would other frown over my misbehaviour. These thoughts makes me feel sad and a little bit lost.
I followed this train of thought when i watched this movie. Japanese movies and animes usually follow these kinds of uncanny but strong sentiments and when done right(not too streched thin like in long-running animes), it is bullseye.

Music is beautiful, landscapes gorgeus, characters deeply elaborated and detailed. Complex and beautiful.",

This is one of those rare movies that just gets better as it unfolds. I was going to say that one of the great points about being a non-Hollywood/American product, you never know if you'll get a happy or tragic ending so it keeps you guessing until the end. But now I read that it is going to be re-made as a Hollywood Live action movie and I'm sad. Do yourself a favor and just watch this one now!",
262,17 May 2017,solahuddeen,10, An experience everyone has been longing for!!,"This is a film that starts off as a rom-com and later develops into one of the greatest film I've ever seen in my life. Some people might think the plot is complex while some might think otherwise. However, I believe that this film shows how director Makoto Shinkai really trusts his audience in putting the pieces together themselves thus proving how mature this film is, spiritually speaking (u'll get it once u watch it).",

The story has been meticulously crafted, even when your confused you feel it still makes sense. The characters are deep, emotional characters and feel very real. By the end of the film you feel all kinds of emotions. It also looks amazing. The style and animation are flawless and feel perfect. My only complaint with this film would be its ending (I will not spoil it). But other than that it is a masterpiece and I implore you to watch it if you a fan of Anime or just films in general.",

The bond that the two main characters created was hard to believe at first but then grew into something that meant so much more than what they were externally dealing with in the story (vague to avoid spoilers). Also, The animation is this film was very aesthetically pleasing with the vibrant colors and the beautiful scenery and attention to detail. Another thing that blew me away was the powerful soundtrack with it's fitting and heartwarming themes. The ending of this film is one of the most satisfying endings I have seen in anything in a while. All in all, Your Name, is an immensely satisfying and emotional film that leaves the audience walking out with a smile on their face.",

I didn't expect there's a movie this great, just in the beginning of the movie it was very entertaining, very unique and very funny. hahaha! I thought that this might be better if done by real actors and actresses, but I this this (anime) would be better, I have seen many anime movies that make a live-action but didn't work, so this is totally fine. No movies to watch? You'd better try this if your not allergic to anime. Unbelievable story, very unique, somehow mind-blowing and you'll fall to the movie. And the animation, the details, the graphics on the background, really great. The creator of the movie is very good.",
270,4 August 2022,EdwardtheBlackPrince,7, Just a little longer,"Makoto Shinkai's Your Name Follows the story of Mitsuha & Taki. Two Complete strangers who one day find themselves having switched places in each other bodies, and over time from a distance start to develop a bond through leaving each other notes and walking a mile in each other shoes. Only to be eventually torn apart by a disaster. This is a movie that came as a bit of a surprise. From many perspectives, it just looks like another romance, but its overall theme of distance is a theme that appears in many of the director's films. It does have a considerable amount of depth. Through its pacing and characters. It gives a relatable experience. Taken the tired played-out concept of body swapping and actually delivers something unique with its formula. The heart of this film does come from its leads and from the start it is actually from different perspectives. It's not Siblings or Friends, it's two random strangers one from Tokyo and the other far out in the countryside. So when they first swap you get the usual tropes of freaking out and even exploring some things for a second. However, at the same time, you believe the situation a lot more. It also really helps that the film doesn't just do the whole hijinks of a boy in a girl's body and vice versa for the duration of the film. They stay on it just enough and yet still keep that story going. Building up the relationship between Taki and Mitsuha. This starts to become even better when a certain thing is revealed about the two and it just adds to the emotions that the film was striving towards. It goes without saying the Animation's beautiful along with the music. The lighting and the shadow work really sets the mood.",
271,2 January 2017,lyx-1,1, Not impressed,"Had high expectations due to the hype and I liked Shinkai's previous works, but was disappointed that it really wasn't special. The plot is bland and predictable, the mystery not quite so mysterious, and you're expected to suspend disbelief but then one would expect an incredible journey that makes it all worthwhile when in reality it's all rather pedestrian of the usual teenage pulp romance genre.

272,25 December 2016,mattb12456,9, A stunning film!,"-This was such an enjoyable film! I laughed, and was smiling throughout. -One of the many things I love about Japanese filmmaking is that they create a mood. Not every scene is directly plot related, but helps to bring you into the film. -If you have been, this film will certainly make you want to return to Japan! A well balanced mix of Tokyo, and Japanese countryside -Heartwarming, and gorgeous. A story about a boy and a girl connected through their dreams, and the impact they make in each other's lives via the dream connection. I definitely recommend this film is you have enjoyed any Japanese animation in the past.

276,15 October 2016,titanicfusion,10, Great little film to watch if you want an emotionally engaging experience,"#Spoiler Free This film could very well be Makoto Shinkai's best film to date. The films excels in creating heartfelt smiles that can turn to tears at the drop of a hat and back again. Similarly to many of his previous works his stories may seem a bit generic and lacking, however this allows the viewer to really focus on the characters and the emotions between them, rather than being caught up in a twisting plot. We are also gifted with Shinkai's train metaphor, however this time unlike 5 cm per second, they show the protagonist journey diverging down separate routes and coming back together all while moving in the same direction to the eventual end of the line.",

290,16 December 2017,Leofwine_draca,6, Another expertly-made anime,"YOUR NAME is another expertly-made anime that hails from Japan and is similar to the high quality of other recent animated drama from that country. The story is about two teenagers, one male and one female, who randomly find themselves swapping bodies on one fateful date and must subsequently investigate their bizarre circumstances. It sounds like a cheesy body-swap romance and indeed I've seen it described as such, but that description doesn't do the film justice. Body-swapping plays a part and there's even some high school tenderness, but this wide-reaching picture also explores themes of disaster, loss, tragedy, family, mythology, and long-distance relationships. It's been made in an exemplary fashion with perfect animation and voice acting, so it's very difficult to criticise it overall.",

It was strange and alien to me how people can even shed a single tear watching this movie (it's not wrong to do so, I just couldn't understand the idea of doing so and yes, I did cry watching other anime before). The movie is artistically stunning and all of the aesthetic were wasted on a story that feels badly stitched together by somewhat decent characters and an okay climax. It's not bad per se but I think that it deserves too much credit for doing so little. In conclusion, it's fine if you like the movie but if you think too hard while watching, it will ruin your experience.",

299,22 April 2018,lucianomarzo92,5, Disappointing,"Disclaimer: I am not a fan of anime. I like Studio Ghibli, but only because their films can be enjoyed and even loved by people who don't typically like anime. Having said that, the animation in this movie is flat-out amazing. Every frame is a work of art, demonstrating unbelievable mastery of the film medium. Though a visual masterpiece, Your Name's flaws are, unfortunately, wide-ranging and deep. In fact, the movie's convoluted plot, poor choice of songs, unappealing characters, and off-putting, melodramatic tone make it a chore to sit through. I realize anime is not for everyone, but this movie really didn't connect with me. And it's not just because it's an anime film. It's because it's a movie whose plot and characters fail to engage the viewer in any meaningful way, whose soundtrack, tone, and overall style actively resist any attempt made by the viewer to enjoy the movie. If you decide to watch this movie, I hope you like it more than I did. Visually, there is a lot to appreciate. The movie is so good visually, I regret that I am not able to leave it a better review.",

The pleasing hand drawn animations are absolutely eye-catching and impressive. The direction of photography is phenomenal and the musical score is stellar and comforting. The film's concept is pretty alright and is executed in a fairly proper way. What brings down the holistic feel of the movie, is it's kind of boring character traits and the way their arcs go. It doesn't have anything all that substantial, as much as it has in style. It is not even close to being as profound as it thinks it is, and it is easily his weakest work in terms of writing.

It is a masterfully crafted film that tells a simple story that manages to be fresh, intriguing, and beautiful throughout the entirety of its hour and fifty-two minute runtime. Shinkai somehow takes an idea that has been done a million times and gives it a fresh, new take that hasn't been done before. Some people will call his films melodramatic or petty, but what some people see as pretentious, I see as a stroke of pure genius. I am not only going to discuss why I believe that Your Name is masterclass filmmaking, but why Makoto Shinkai is a legend in the works. Firstly, I am going to go over my history with the film, and my initial reaction to seeing it. ",

314,30 January 2020,Martinlindved,5, Touching breasts,"I chose this title because that is as close of a relationship the two characters have. Even in after a dramatic reveal the film refuses to let go of this gag.
The pacing is off: at first, it spends a lot of time showing the two main characters and seemingly allows the viewer to understand what's happening, bit then the film slaps the point in your face, grabs your arm and pulls you through 2 minutes of thick exposition that could've explored their unique relationship. It then reaches a reveal and a realization it undercuts with awkward humor and continues to focus on the teenage romance while keeping an inevitable and horrible natural disaster as a sub-plot as if two teenagers who never meet until the very end and doesn't know each other is more important for the targeted audience - the juxtaposition is comedic!
While the animation is beautiful as seen in for examples with apparent usage of rotoscope and the twilight-meeting, the awkward pacing and opening of the film makes me feel as if I'm watching a short-series cut into being a film. The forced music doesn't help as it gives me the impression this was cynically included for commercial success without making it contextualized and it even makes segments feel like music videos or AMVs.
Overall: good idea I wish had a clearer and more ""streamlined"" execution.",

Born and grew up in Asia I have no problem with understanding the cultural symbols flashing through much of the film. It would be a cliché of me to describe how beautiful the production is and how vivid the pictures are. What captures me most is the poignant emotional connections between the film characters as well as with audience like me. The film's story line evolves from a devastating catastrophe caused by meteor shower, but out of it emerges compassion, courage and strength. It is more than a sci-fi movie, it is a movie of humanity. I highly recommend it and cannot wait to get a copy of the BR disc as soon as it comes out.",

326,14 May 2017,drkdsm-1,10," A pure visual, auditory, mentally-satisfying, spiritual, magical, spell-binding extravaganza","The ""anime"" form has a limited niche of audience may be due to the fact that computer-generated animation appears to be an eye-candy! Well these were my thoughts before I watched this movie (in Japanese). And boy, I was so wrong! I had watched Spirited Away in English a long time back due to its such rave reviews but somehow i felt that I missed something in that movie that others could see and I could not. And that was the end of my 'anime' career. Fast forward 4 years and here I was going through a rough patch of time as I beginning to think that good movies are not being made anymore and that I have watched everything there is to watch and that creativity has limits too! Well you can always be denounced wrong if you have directors like Mr Makoto Shinkai. Hats off to this great director and the music composers Mr Youjirou Noda and the Radwumps band!!! They have produced a masterpiece. A gem of a gem! What sweet romantic love story, a perfect romcoms! Also many praises to the editor of the movie that is again Mr Shinkai... The chemistry between the two lead characters is so strong and intense that you will be spell-bound. First half was a ""feel-good"" part that made me thought is this what the people all raving about? True even in first half, some of the scenes with the background song ZenZenZense were absolutely stunning like the scene with sunrise in the city and sunset in the rural area. Both are shot with absolute precision. Then the second half starts and you ate really caught off-guard. Now you will be really into the story that what is going on and what will happen further! I was on the verge of tears at 3 points in the movie and simultaneously I was pitching for the two protagonists. The comet scene with the song SPARKLE in the background provided a breath-stopping view of the beauty of the scenery. End of the movie was mentally satisfying when you are so much into the characters that any more tragedy might have made me crying my heart out. ",
327,26 January 2018,Sultan187,10, I loved this movie.,This movie is an art i really recommend you guys to see this movie.,
328,15 April 2021,Jodro2,6," OK, but kitschy, difficult to understand, and badly paced.","We watched this movie with the entire family, full of expectation because the reviews are so glowing. We found it OK, but there were many things that we were not impressed with. To provide some balance to all the 10 ratings I'll focus on those:",

10/10 for a great movie, 100% would watch again.",

332,3 February 2017,marcosgdmo,9, My heart has been seduced,"I'm not an huge anime fan, but even I can see the quality in this film.",
333,16 June 2018,alphaphilipp,10, Cliff Hangar!! But...,"The ending can be a disappointment to those who watched it already but overall, the story and plot is good. I even cried watching this which means I totally can relate and I understood it too. Deserves a higher rating!!",
334,14 March 2018,eternallydaydreamin,10, Necessary to watch!,"I never thought I will write a review anywhere in my life.. But this movie is magnificent, it is the best thing I have ever watched. Hopefully I will see more movies like this in the future.. Full of feelings.. I never cried so much. 100% Recommended movie to everyone.",
335,22 May 2022,ademyucell,10," Genuine, Sincere and Original","Tender, curious, well-written scenario and perfect visual art for every age... I don't know whether just because this movie has a special place in my heart or it was really that beautiful. So, maybe my review can be biased. But for any case, if you somehow watched any anime, you will love it.",
336,17 July 2022,kegebler,10, Such a well done movie.,What a good movie. I have been watching anime for over 20 years and it's rare to find just such a well done movie. Beautiful animation and just a good story that takes a few twists and leaves you wanting. Not to mention the ending was well done. He sobers up definitely must see. Great for couples watching.,
337,29 August 2020,Rifat_Rock_Don,10, 😍😘😍😍😭😭😍,Best Masterpiece Anime Movie All time 😭😭😭😘😍😍😍,
338,17 November 2019,paulclaassen,6, Superb!,Uhm...wow! Another exceptional animated film from Japan. The animation is stunning! You certainly haven't experienced animated films until you've watched an animated film from Japan. They are so different to the Hollywood films.,
339,17 November 2020,sunnyyang-07984,10," Incredibly vivid, original and beautiful",This is not normally a movie or anime that would fit my taste of genres. However upon recommendation from social media I decided to give this a whirl.,
340,10 March 2018,romained-49721,10, Amazing,"The suspense was killing me, i absolutely loved it.",
341,5 May 2020,deepaksamrat-77624,10, Great!,"Love the way movie runs, every bit of a moment gives us a hope , the hope for the lovely future may the two characters meet... Though movie ended with a happy note. Still feels like something missing in me this movie makes me sad :(",
342,28 August 2021,emon-84683,9, Masterpiece,"It's truly a masterpiece. The story, the music, the animations all are masterpiece. It made me realize how important that one person in our life is. No matter how many people we date or meet, we fall for that same person again and again. Never lose your real love no matter how much struggle you've to go though. It's my first anime movie and I'm so much glad that I gave it a shot.",
343,3 September 2018,DrDarkness,10, Just... Wow.,"Okay - one thing we need to make clear. Exchanging bodies. Not a ""never been done"" feature, and usually executed as running gags of ""oh I got boobs"" and ""oh I got a pee pee"". If you're hesitant to watch this movie because of this story aspect I can assure you - it gets noted with some expected gags, but in this movie the characters actually get over it!",
344,19 July 2019,kosmasp,8, Switching,"You get thrown into this and you have to figure out what is what. Unless you know the source material and/or read synopsis of the movie of course. I hadn't so some of the stuff came as a surprise but there is a lightness at the beginning of it, which switches or changes gear throughout the movie. I wouldn't go as far as to say ""forget Disney"". There's a different audience and a different feel to this movie for sure, why not have both? Instead of viewing something negatively take in the positive.",
345,2 May 2020,izazmahmudsakib,10, It's hard to understanding first time,I like the ending most when they saw together. Bt first when i saw i was just thinking what thay do weird things always. Bt ending i slowly slowy understand everything. Bt 2 time i saw this movie then i understand everything.,
346,17 January 2021,kamrulemon-07993,10, Maybe the best music in an anime,This is movie is astoundingly best in case of music composition. The Radwimps band have forged some masterpiece for this movie. The music and background sfx all add to the scenes of the movie. It's blended so perfect that without this level of music and composition this movie would have been average. For me this particular thing made it one in a million.,
347,6 September 2022,wesseldj-48581,3, Pretentiously boring,"Don't understand the high rating, as it is, don't get me wrong, beautifully animated, but there were just so many plotholes to the story that it was difficult to engage yourself into it. Questions like how were they able to switch bodies, and why they forget their names were all not explained. It just seems like lazy writing to me as some things were set up too coincidently, like how they meet up at the end of the film. Also the comet struck the place twice is also very unlikely and have to suspend your believe too much. The town eventually got wiped out, but is it not like groundhog day that they could try to save the town over and over again, until it works? Just with a romantic plot line just doesn't cut it, and the romantic plot is very thin aswell and wasn't enough to get me invested. Very forgettable storyline.",
348,2 July 2021,ashishjha-18568,10, One of the best movies if you understand it,"This movie left a great impact on me and I was thinking about it even after days of watching it . The answer to the question, how far will you go for love ? Is this master piece, highly recommend.",
349,8 February 2021,aririfqi,9, The first anime that made me cry,"The story is a 8/10, and the animation is a 10/10, i would recommend this to everyone who wanted to taste what is anime looked like",
350,5 June 2021,johnpc-43000,10, They tried hard to make me cry 😢. They almost did it.,Just Wonderful i can't describe how fuc*ing good it is but unfortunately today(Saturday June 5th) is the last day of this movie on Netflix (at least in my country). 😭,
351,9 August 2018,donahueb-81565,3, Overrated,"Your Name is one of those movies/shows where I just don't understand the ridiculous praise it gets. Yes, the concept of body swapping is interesting and well executed in the first half. But then it starts to become full of extremely vague or completely unexplained plot points that break immersion and leaves the viewer unsatisfied. It's a complete mess. The ending is also dumb and negates the entire point of the movie.",
352,1 June 2017,patrik-esk,10," Well executed tropes, ingenuity and visual porn","Who would have know... This gem took a while to cross the oceans into western audiences cinemas, and it was worth every minute! It is a signature Makoto Shinkai piece, the visuals are just beautiful, the dedication to representing modern Tokyo and the Japan country-side is mesmerizing, a work of art which carries intensity and uses all at its disposal to provide a truly cinematic experience, including a great soundtrack! Story wise I can't praise enough the well executed tropes from the genre, and the appropriately quick pacing which respects the audience capacity to follow the flow. Plot wise there's no overly complicated setups (altough some would argue the plot is complicated...), the hooks are fantastically delivered and more than delights the viewer with their conclusions. The main character relationships are always on the forefront, and the secondary characters are well fleshed out, the audience grows to love them.",
353,23 March 2018,tk-williamson,3, What am I missing?,I can't get past the awful voice characterizations - all the grunting and what you usually have in American dubbed anime. The artwork and animation is stunning but can't hold my attention.,
354,24 October 2021,AndreiPavlov,2, Brilliant animation destroyed by the weak plot and unimpressive sentimentality,"Well, everything was mentioned above actually. It hurts me as a viewer badly to see breathtaking visuals completely annihilated by a thin and stupid plot. Lots of sentiments and juvenile tears. And very prolonged tedious storytelling.",
355,25 August 2022,Mangalassery_Neelakandan,10, ANIME MASTERPIECE,"This is that sort of anime that gives you once in a life time experience. The stunning visuals, the story, and all the aspects contribute to this being a masterpiece. Every one watching this movie should keep track of the red ribbon as it plays a significant role in the movie. I watched the movie like a year ago and to this day I remember the scenes and plot. I watched this movie as one day google suggested it to me as a must watch anime movie & i had zero expectations but i watched the movie any way, little did i know it was going to be one of the best anime experience of my life. A must watch for Anime fans or for every one who watches a movie.",
356,31 January 2020,monica-sarna-infertile,9, I specifically wrote this review beacsue I am an adult,"And I very much enjoyed this anime. It is amusing, it is amazing and the story holds your attention.
Watch it because the girl and the female employee are eye candy to relish, the universe is so multi-faceted and detailed and I love the story.",
