0,16 December 2013,gogoschka-1,10, Best romantic comedy ever,* May contain spoilers *,/
1,21 October 2005,kylopod,10," A perfect blend of comedy, clever plotting, and character study","Even the funniest movies eventually stop making me laugh after I've watched them enough times that the humor no longer surprises me. A joke never has the same effect when you know the punch line in advance. But every once in a blue moon, a comedy comes along that is so thoughtful and meaningful in addition to being funny that after seeing it a dozen times and laughing less often, I start noticing its depth and insight. For me, no movie has so perfectly united hilarity with profundity as ""Groundhog Day,"" which happens to be my favorite movie of all time.",r
2,29 August 2019,perica-43151,10," Clever film making, showing substance and talents of lead actor","This is one warm, intelligent movie. It really lives to its reputation, which is overwhelmingly positive. A lot of substance, all understated, some laughs, respects its audience and delivers points cleverly. If you want to be encouraged and shown a positive perspective with almost no pandering, this is a movie to watch.",e
3,21 August 2005,Ric-7,10, Neglected Masterpiece,"I thought the film was terrific when I saw it in theaters twelve years ago. Recently in watching it again on cable, I was amazed at the quality of the screenplay. I didn't notice the first time. But on repeated viewings (like reliving Groundhog Day), I was impressed at the story created by the writers. This film is so much more than witty jokes and comic riffs arranged around a gimmick. It has an internal logic and consistency that is very rarely found in screenplays. No joke seemed disposable, and as you laugh your way along, the philosophy underlying the film takes over your imagination.",v
4,30 June 2019,elijah-alcantara,9, I got you babe,"It's 2019 and I still watch this movie from time to time, feels like 6am all over again. I've seen a few copy-cat movies borrowing the same 'repeats' but it's just not the same or memorable.",i
5,23 October 2001,Hitchcoc,9, A Soul Reclaimed,"This movie is so charming. It starts out with Phil Connor, the Bill Murray character, doing his Bill Murray. Cynicism emanating from every pore. He is harsh, disinterested, angry, full of angst. Making jokes about everything. Everybody knows it. Everybody feels it. When the ""gift"" or ""curse"" comes to him to relive the same day over and over, he at first is confused, then flippant, then angry, then suicidal, and, finally, sees it as a chance to reclaim his humanity. This is done in a series of repetitious acts which ultimately lead to his willingness to sacrifice himself, live for the day, and try to show that he is worth saving. What this movie does, like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" is ask us what we would do, given the same circumstances. Would we fall into a retreat of depression? Would we become something that we always wanted to be? Would we keep living it the same way, hoping for he best? Murray's character wants the romance and the commitment that he was never willing to give. He toys with his own approach to the world, experimenting and doing things until he gets them right. He goes through a period of embracing the bad, lusting after Andy MacDowell, forcing himself on the other women in the town, disdaining the ""characters"" he meets. But like most ""everymen,"" he eventually must become good because without that, it doesn't matter anymore.",e
6,27 April 2005,Galina_movie_fan,9, When the gods wish to punish us...,"In Harold Ramis's ""Groundhog Day"" (1993), an intriguing comedy about repeating the past, Bill Murray is Phil Connors, an arrogantly self-centered and cynical TV weatherman, sent for the fifth time to the small town of Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog ceremony held every February 2nd. He stumbles into a time warp and winds up repeating the same day over and over again until forced to look at himself from the distance and to examine his attitude. ",w
7,9 September 2004,barnabyrudge,8," Ingenious concept, enthusiastically presented.","Bill Murray can be a very funny guy, especially when given roles where his character has a deliciously cruel edge. He has one of those faces, and a voice to go with it, which can make nastiness and sarcasm funny. Groundhog Day is a highly enjoyable vehicle for Murray's talents. It also has a very clever concept, neatly brought to the screen by actor-turned-director Harold Ramis (who starred alongside Murray in the Ghostbusters films).",/
8,4 June 2012,namashi_1,10, A Masterpiece! Bill Murray is Terrific!,"Harold Ramis's 'Groundhog Day' is A Masterpiece! A wonderful, meaningful film, that also offers loads of entertainment. And Bill Murray delivers a yet another Terrific Performance! ",r
9,19 July 2006,leplatypus,10, An eternal movie.... (DVD),"I thought at first that it was only a concept movie: a ""what-if"" story; an unbelievable story in reality but a very funny & rich one in the philosophical reflexion, like only arts can offer. Another example of this free creativity would be for me ""Back to the future""... You can't go back in your past, but your imagination does! Here's the bottled-up feeling of eternity is excellently considered: the assets (you have time to learn, you know everything & every one...) and the pitfalls (a final boredom, the sadness of losing people without preventing it,...)",w
10,11 October 2020,Xstal,8, Beauty & the Murray...,"For all intents and purpose Bill Murray plays the role of the beast in a time looped reprisal of Beauty & the Beast. I fancy however, had the beast in the original tale had a potentially perpetual number of goes at winning the girl over and he had access to Rohypnol the story told would be anything but a fairy tale - fortunately that isn't the case here as Bill Murray is equipped with a veritable tool store of innovative, hilarious, wacky and inspiring methods to win the girl over. There are plenty of other valuable takeaways, not the least a caustic appraisal of the modern world and how it can affect us but let's not get too serious - few people have ever had the ability to pull stuff off like this and, for it to remain as entertaining and as fresh as the day it was released, makes Bill Murray one of those few people.",4
11,3 November 2016,studioAT,10, One to watch over and over again,"'Groundhog Day' is right up there with the best work Bill Murray has ever done, and it's also one of the best comedies ever made too.",2
12,30 May 2008,planktonrules,9, What's not to like about this film?!,"While GROUNDHOG DAY is not my favorite Bill Murray comedy, it is one of three brilliant comedies he made during the early 90s and all three are absolute must-sees. And, interestingly enough, while the film is very funny, it also has some wonderful and poignant moments--something I usually hate in comedies.",1
13,12 March 2003,MovieAddict2016,10, Excellent comedy that anyone can relate to.,"Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, a weatherman for a local news station. Every year he goes to Puxatawney, Pennsylvania for the Puxatawney Phil event: commonly recognized as Groundhog Day. You know how it goes. The groundhog comes out. If it sees its shadow, it's six more weeks of winter. If it doesn't, it's spring.",6
14,17 November 2003,pachin,10," Bill Murray's greatest movie and one of the greatest comedies, no, one of the great movies of all time.","Two clues to tell if a movie is great is how often it is copied and how it has become a part of American slang. Groundhog Day has had both happen to it. Warning: POSSIBLE SPOILERS. Bill Murray played Phil Connors, a egocentric and grumpy weatherman in Pennsylvania who goes to Punxsutawny, Pa every year to see if the groundhog sees his shadow for the local television station with his producer, played by the wonderful Andie MacDowell, and his cameraman, played by a low keyed Chris Elliot.",9
15,2 April 2020,bevo-13678,10, Love it,Great movie. I watched it over and over anD over again. Or at least it felt like I did. I like the bit where he snaps the pencil,2
16,9 January 2018,Leofwine_draca,9, Perfectly-judged comedy,"GROUNDHOG DAY is a classic comedy of 1993 that goes to show that the best premises are the simple ones. Bill Murray is perfectly cast as a jerk of a local TV weatherman who finds himself forced to live the same mundane day over and over again. I was partly dreading this because of the focus on his romance with Andie MacDowell, fearing another vomit-inducing film in the style of FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, but I needn't have worried. MacDowell is very good here (although the film belongs to Murray) and the romance handled sensitively. However, it's much more than just a romance. It's a film which explores the human condition and has a lesson for both Murray and the viewers in how to treat people. It's funny rather than preachy, and comes across in a very similar fashion to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE except with many more laugh-out-loud moments.",1
17,6 December 2004,caspian1978,8, Bill's Best,"Not counting Caddy shack, this is Bill Murray's best performance. While Christmas and Halloween have their annual holiday movies, who would have thought that Groundhog Day would have a movie of its own.",/
18,24 December 2018,andreykol,10, Every time is like the first time,"It's been 6 or even 7 years since I watched this masterpiece. Possibly, you would argue: 'Hey, if it is a excellent movie, what is Titanic, The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption?"" Well, if you are still not bored after a hundred views, it is perfect movie for you. And it holds for me. Easy, but important idea is the key of everything. This is love we all want in our lives.
And I should note pretty good acting of Bill Murray.",?
19,2 February 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, Delightful film with great performances and a surprisingly refreshing concept,"Groundhog Day is a wonderful movie. Essentially it is a one-joke comedy, but what makes Groundhog Day so delightful is that whereas it could have been derivative and predictable, the film is always full of life and full to the brim with fresh ideas. The script is a delight, always funny, quotable and witty, while the story has a surprisingly refreshing concept and several great scenes.",r
20,16 January 2022,KissEnglishPasto,10, Rise and Shine You Campers.... It´s Groundhog Day!,"Other than my Favorite movie.... 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY .... This is the Film that, during my 74 Years on Planet Earth, I have seen the most! (Perhaps, 20 times!) My English students love it, because the repitition makes the dialogue easier to understand! Is that Art imitating LIFE ....or LIFE imitating ART???",e
21,9 November 2004,Danny-Szlanina,8, It's just what life is all about.,"My brother told me that some people say ""ground hog"" day is one of the most spiritual movies ever made. First times I watched the movie ( I already have seen it a dozen times) I just laughed about it. But after some times watching I saw what the director wanted to say with it.",f
22,30 September 2019,Calicodreamin,8, Cute,"A quirky movie about a guy forced to live the same day over and over again. You watch the evolution as he firsts tries to use his powers for ""evil"", then entirely gives up on living entirely, then decides to use his powers for ""good"". It's a really cute movie, the acting is great from everyone, and the characters are well developed. Really fun to watch.",_
23,30 October 2017,classicsoncall,8," ""Will Phil come out to see his shadow?""","I was ready to question why this movie would have found a place in IMDb's 'Top 250', but I read a few insightful reviews offered by other viewers and their ideas made me stop and think. In particular, user 'KFL' had some really meaningful insights that I had to take into consideration and his comments changed my thinking about the picture. So thank you once again to IMDb and the thoughtful folks who share their ideas on these boards.",=
24,16 April 2014,estebangonzalez10,9, A spiritual and philosophical film that also happens to be quite entertaining.,"""What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?"" ""That about sums it up for me.""",t
25,14 February 2021,stamv,10, A true Masterpiece,"I don't remember how many times I watched this movie. It is one of the best comedies ever with excellent analogy of humor and romance. Also, in my opinion, is probably the best movie of Bill Murray.",t
26,2 February 2012,Hey_Sweden,10," Complex, endearing movie; more than just ""high concept"" comedy.","Only with the passage of time and an increased sense of awareness can I now see a remarkable movie like ""Groundhog Day"" for what it is. The last time I watched it, and that was some time ago, I mostly saw an engaging comedy / drama / fantasy with moments both funny and sobering. Now, I can look at it and see what a thoughtful piece of work it is. It is true that it's the kind of movie that really does benefit from repeat viewings.",_
27,13 June 2005,the-jerk,10, Incredibly deep and also hilarious,"""Groundhog Day"" is another example of a movie that deserved multiple nominations (and wins) at the Academy Awards. At the time, it was often dismissed as a light fantasy-comedy. But actually Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis wrote an incredibly intelligent, heartwarming, and funny script, and Bill Murray put in the performance of his lifetime.",u
28,6 September 2014,Vivekmaru45,10, Before Jim Carrey There Was Bill Murray.,"Though I'm not a big fan of Bill Murray, this film was highly entertaining and refreshing. Having missed a chance to see it in my youth, I am seeing this film for the first time in my thirties. These days I research about a film first before I see it. The concept of this film appealed to my imagination: a man repeating a specific day, Groundhog day, over and over again.",r
29,19 March 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9, Same Old/Same Old.....And We Love It!,"Although I haven't watched this in awhile, I found it a very nice lighthearted romance/comedy that got better with each of the three times I viewed it. The role is perfect for Bill Murray, who is good at the playing a likable rogue, a guy always full of baloney but you don't seem to mind. The transformation of his personality is fun to watch in this film and gives it a sweet ending that was popular with audiences.",v
30,3 May 2020,Don_Falone1985,10, Timeless classic,"One of the greatest comedies of all time. The 80s and early 90s were the pinnacle of comedies and this one is one of the greats. Not only does it have a brilliant story, but it has heart and a moral to it. Weatherman Bill Connors played by the excellent Bill Murray is a miserable and selfish type character who is a weatherman for the news. He reports on a tradition called Ground hog day in a small Town with his crew. I won't go into detail of the story, but he basically wakes up in a time loop reciting the same day over and over again. He tries to better himself as a person and help others around him as he's in a situation he can't escape from. A timeless classic I have seen over 10 times. They don't make movies like this anymore.",
31,3 November 2014,tavm,9, Groundhog Day was one of Harold Ramis' best movies as director,"So after 21 years of only hearing about this movie (though when I worked at a movie theatre at the time, I did manage to watch a few scenes here and there), I finally got to see the whole thing on Netflix disc with my mom who hadn't seen this when it was first released either. She was confused part of the time but she seemed to enjoy it while I knew about the living-the-same-day-over premise the whole time. It's funny seeing Bill Murray at first taking advantage of what he can get away with in going back to what it was before and then experiencing some depression in not going forward before redeeming himself in the process. Andie MacDowell is luminous as his eventual love interest. Chris Elliott has some moments near the end. Bill's brother Brian Doyle-Murray is appropriately boisterous as the groundhog spokesman. And Stephan Tobolowsky is a hoot as this Ned fellow Bill keeps encountering. Harold Ramis did fine as director and co-writer and he provides a nice commentary track on the DVD. Since he died earlier in the year, this review is dedicated in his memory.",
32,20 July 2021,safenoe,9, Timeless,"I remember first watching Groundhog Day a few years after watching the compelling short 12:01 (starring Kurtwood Smith). 12:01 was released in 1991 and Groundhog Day in 1993, and both with incredibly similar storylines, although Bill Murray brought more humor and wimsy to the role. ""Groundhog Day"" has entered the lexicon for sure thanks to this seminal movie that serves as a philosophical cornerstone for all.",
33,15 July 2012,The-Sarkologist,7, When you are trapped in one day and cannot escape.,"This is a strange movie because there are some existentialist elements to it, some elements of Carpe Diem, and some elements of the inability of humanity to control his or her environment. I have never seen a movie with this sort of plot before and as such I consider it to be incredibly unique and as such worth watching and considering, if only for a unique plot. Not only is the plot unique, but the main character, Phil (Bill Murry) grows and develops through the film as he tries to come to terms with what is happening to him.",
34,27 October 2013,SnoopyStyle,9, Great Harold Ramis touch and Sarcastic Bill Murray,Sarcastic and egotistical TV weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) is forced to cover Punxsutawney Phil groundhog day for the fourth year in a row. Beautiful new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) join him. He makes fun of her cheerfulness and hates all the quaint small town happiness but he's certainly willing to hit on her.,
35,4 August 2022,Sleepin_Dragon,10," An amazing, memorable movie.","I'm sure we all feel that we're stuck in a rut at times, that every day is the same, that's what life's like for Phil, every day is the same, every day is Groundhog Day.",
36,25 July 2020,BA_Harrison,9, A film with great repeat value.,"As I type, the past 4 months have been spent in lockdown because of coronavirus, every day seeming like groundhog day. It's thanks to this film that the phrase 'groundhog day' is even in my lexicon, having come to mean 'a situation in which a series of unwelcome or tedious events appear to be recurring in exactly the same way'.",
37,28 March 2013,hitchcockthelegend,10, Is it snowing in space?,"There's really not a lot you can say about Groundhog Day that hasn't been said before. It's unlikely that anyone remotely interested in Bill Murray would have not seen it by now, and in all likelihood loves it because it's nailed on one of Murray's finest pictures. Of course, as is the case with comedy in general, there are those who don't like it, but in my experience it's the one comedy movie that tickles the funny bones of most the most! Some have seen it just the once and loved it but feel it is a once only movie, others such as myself return to it yearly like an old friend because it's a pick me up, a tonic for the troops, it never fails to deliver the goods.",
38,14 November 2019,acedj,10, Perfect mix of comedy and thought,"It's that time of year again, and Phil is off to Punxsutawney to see the groundhog. There is a big storm coming, but Phil is the lone weatherman to say it will miss the area. He has a surly attitude and abhors this trip. It is made slightly more enjoyable by the producer Rita coming along. Throw in the goofy cameraman named Larry, and you have quite the dysfunctional trio. Phil ends up in a time loop, doomed to repeat groundhog day for eternity, and he is the only one aware of this. Each day the events of the previous day are erased, along with everyone's memory, except poor Phil.
Now, forget the fact that Bill Murray is far too old to be a romantic interest for Andie MacDowell, and the rest is just plain fun. It is well acted and the jokes are still funny when you've seen this the 100th time. Will poor Phil ever see tomorrow, or will he be stuck forever in groundhog day?",
39,14 July 2005,TheNorthernMonkee,9, philosophical comedy genius,"SPOILERS It's almost unheard of for a piece of comedy genius to also be so deeply meaningful and philosophical. Yet, in 1993's ""Groundhog Day"", writer Danny Rubin has created something very special. Hilarious at times and often quite deep, this film is deservedly praised by everyone who sees it.",
40,7 April 2005,RARubin,10, Groundhog Is Jesus,"Groundhog Day was a Harold Ramis-Danny Green script that Ramis ingeniously shot in a freezing Woodstock, IL for a 1993 release. All the film critics at the time noted it as a cute romantic comedy with no particular accomplishment. Everyone I know who has seen it, myself included, liked it and smiled on their way out of the theater. Groundhog Day is on the American calendar, and the film is often played on that day in mid-winter where those of us in colder climates are dreaming of Spring. Today Groundhog Day is considered one of the great American Films of the late 20th Century. Danny Rubin created the concept while Harold Ramis, co-writer of Animal House and Caddyshack broke away from his previous gross-comedy productions to direct his Opus Maximus. That's how Jonah Goldberg of the National Review described it in the February 2005 issue of the Conservative magazine.",
41,27 March 2004,DavidSim240183,10, The greatest comedy of the 90s,"Bill Murray is without a doubt one of my favourite comedians. His deadpan, laid back attitude always makes him a hoot to watch. That was one of the reasons why Ghostbusters was such a success. But Groundhog Day has got to be his best comedy since, because this ingenious Harold Ramis film is tailor made for Bill Murray's talents.",
42,11 May 2020,TheHoodOfSwords,8, Heartwarming Joy Filled Movie,"Do you know those movies that you can just come back to and feel comforted? This is one of those movies for me. I hadn't seen it in a few years but for Mother's day, my mom and I decided to watch it with her. This movie is just heartwarming. Bill Murray carries this obviously since he is the only character that actually has any character development. This movie sparked my love for movies repeating the same scenario over and over again. This, Happy death day, source code. I love or at least like them all. This movie is a lot of fun and I would recommend it if you want to just laugh a bit and have a heartwarming movie fill you up.",
43,14 December 2004,Enchorde,8, Sweet and witty,** O'boy here be spoilers ** ,
44,5 September 2015,Vartiainen,8," Within every man there's goodness, given enough time","One of the most well-known Bill Murray films, a movie that defined a whole subgenre of time travel fiction – the so called ""Groundhog Day Loop"" – while also being a sweet love story in its own right. Nowadays it's a loved classic, and for a good reason. Its premise is really rather simple, a man is forced to live out the exact day over and over again, but the film makers explore its possibilities to their fullest, giving us a tale about the meaning of human interaction, loneliness and the depths we can either sink or rise when there's no one to witness us.",
45,2 February 2020,masonsaul,9, Incredible and innovative comedy,Whilst the ending is predictable (but still very satisfying) Groundhog Day is an incredible and innovative comedy that uses it's amazing concept extremely effectively and explores all of it's possible scenarios. Bill Murray gives an incredible lead performance. It's well paced and Harold Ramis' direction is great. It's also consistently charming and funny.,
46,23 July 2019,HotToastyRag,10, An iconic masterpiece,"I'm pretty sure everyone in America has seen Groundhog Day, and that most of America watches it every year on the holiday itself. I'm included in the latter and have seen the movie over twenty times with my family. We eat Angel food cake, stuffing it in our mouths when Bill Murray does onscreen, and we drink sweet vermouth on the rocks with a twist. Even as kids, we drank bitters to pretend we could fit in with Andie MacDowell. We even have a relative who tried to calculate just how many Groundhog Days Bill lived through! Our family is hardly unique, and I'm sure millions of others enjoy the same ritual every February 2nd.",

48,7 March 2004,mjw2305,9, Really a God,"Imagine you can't be killed, you can't get in trouble, your actions lead to no consequence; and you begin to know everything about everything. Are you really a God? No your Bill Murray in Groundhog Day one of the finest comedy films to ever grace the screen. He wakes every morning in the same place at the same time on the same day.",
49,5 February 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,9," A fantastic film that belongs in any conversation that considers the classics; everyone should watch this one, over and over again.","One of the most layered, genuinely feel-good and emotionally powerful comedies of all time, this fantastic film belongs in any conversation that considers the classics. 'Groundhog Day (1993)' is a truly phenomenal piece of film-making by all accounts, a picture which is at once funny, endearing, touching, saddening, inspiring, enlightening, thought-provoking and an all-around amazing experience that's ironically endlessly re-watchable. There's a whole following surrounding this film and its Buddhistic approach to spiritualism and self-improvement, which just goes to show how much the filmmakers were able to intelligently 'milk' this 'what-if' idea for all it was worth in an incredibly artistically rich way that's as inspired as it is entertaining or hilarious. It's something that rises above almost all others in its genre and, even, medium. Everyone should watch this one, over and over again. 9/10",
50,4 January 2020,cricketbat,10, I can watch this film over and over and over and over....,"This film isn't just a quirky and original idea, it also a fascinating point of view on humanity and how we react to various situations. Plus, it has a positive message and an uplifting conclusion. This film is one of the greats.",

52,29 September 2014,g-bodyl,10, The Defining Film of Bill Murray's Career!,"As a movie buff, I cannot believe that I have not seen Groundhog Day until now and I wonder what put me off from seeing this movie for so long, especially as a big Bill Murray fan. This film uses his comedic talent to a long extent, but also this is a showcase for his dramatic talent too. This film has a rather interesting concept in reliving a day every day for what seems to be forever. This film is somewhat predictable, but it has a sweet, undeniable message about love and life.",
53,11 April 2015,lesleyharris30,9," Very Unique with Comedy and Charming Performances,","Groundhog Day is a terrific movie with a very well written storyline and a fantastic comedic cast. It is a really unique comedy film, there really isn't anything else quite like it, the concept was really interesting, seeing a man repeat the same day over and over again, and it is thoroughly entertaining. Bill Murray delivers a terrific performance, he has a lot of very funny parts, but he also gets to show a more dramatic side, something the world had seen little of from Murray at this stage in his career, particularly his scenes with Andie MacDowell are very well acted and their chemistry together was superb. Funny and very sweet, I would recommend Groundhog Day to anyone looking for a good comedy. ",
54,2 June 2020,BlueSkies765,10, A long day in Punxsutawney,"Like Phil who's reliving the same day over and over again, I've watched this movie many times and it always manages to put a smile on my face. My favorite aspect is the comedy. Bill Murray obviously as the star. I always loved his comedic style in 80s/90s movies. But all the other characters were funny too.",
55,22 March 2009,ctomvelu-1,10, Deja vu all over again,"GROUNDHOG DAY is a masterpiece that has been often imitated, but never equaled. Bill Murray in his prime plays a cocky and horribly bored weatherman who travels to the tiny town of Punxsatawney, Pa., for Groundhog Day and finds himself stuck there on the same day over and over again. At first, he makes a game of it, then he tries killing himself, and finally comes around to realizing he's been given a second chance. You've seen the plot before, but never so well done. Andie MacDowell, also in her prime, costars as Murray's love interest. The writer (Dan Rubin) and director (longtime Murray cohort and GHOSTBUSTERS costar Harold Ramis) really outdo themselves with this clever film. This is the first film I have ever given a 10 to. It is well-deserved.",
56,2 February 2005,petabit,10, This movie gets better every time I see it,"I just read somewhere that the Internet is full of philosophers and religions that have adopted this movie as their favorite parable. I'm not surprised, but that's not the reason I love it.",
57,28 April 2015,taylorkingston,10, One of my all-time favorite movies...,"I really love this movie. It's funny, it's inventive and imaginative, the acting work is great and the casting choices were the best it could've ever been. I think this movie is just fantastic. Even though, when you watch it now, it's very outdated, it still will bring laughter into your home. I've seen it so many times, too many times in fact, and I never get sick of it. ",
58,9 May 2019,zutterjp48,8, A very funny comedy,"This film is really a masterpiece of fantasy and comedy.Bill Murray is absolutly fabulous in his role of Phil Connors who is obliged to cover for the fourth time the event and suddenly is living the same day over and over again.Andie MacDowell is also fabulous in her role of Rita, which is surprised by Phil's behavior !!
I enjoyed very much this film, I laughed for so much comic and also tragicomic situtations the characters were living in this small town.
Thanks also Mr. Harold Ramis for this very funny comedy !!",
59,13 September 2016,Tweekums,9, Bill Murray has a bad day over and over again,"Pittsburgh Weatherman Phil Connors is not overjoyed when he is once again sent to observe the Groundhog Day festivities in the town of Punxsutawney. He goes there the day before with his producer, Rita, and cameraman Larry then heads to the bed and breakfast he is staying at. He wakes at 6am and heads to the site of the ceremony where Phil, the groundhog, is due to predict whether or not winter is over. After a half-hearted report they have something to eat before setting off home only to be forced back by a blizzard that Phil and said was certain to miss the area. Unable to continue he returns to the B&B. The next morning he gets a sense of deja vu it would appear that it is Groundhog Day again. This doesn't just happen once; for Phil Groundhog day keeps repeating although nobody else is aware of this.

But no matter how skillful the cast, however, you're not going to get very far if the screenplay is not absolutely first-rate – and that it is! True, I thought the script's central idea was a bit overdone in places and put too much strain on credulity (e.g. the car plunging off the cliff and bursting into flames), but more than 90% of the time, the narrative does hang together rather well, despite the script's occasional attempts to undermine credulity. Of course it's an idea that Hollywood has used before, but previous versions have not explored its implications as cleverly as this riveting scenario. It's Murray's film. In fact, he is on the screen continually from go to whoa, but he handles the role so cleverly and with such charisma that it's not until is all over that we realize how adept he has been at disguising his continual presence and allowing some of the other actors, like the gifted Andie MacDowell, a few moments center screen.

Undoubtedly, you will then be able to grasp the beauty that lies within (after repeated viewings, of course-not because they are required, but because you will want to). This movie is so well-made on many levels. If you're feeling down, this movie will cheer you up and probably change your outlook on life. I have seen this movie many times and I know it will be seen many more. It is that special. I am obsessed, as I'm sure there are many more that feel the way I do. Maybe you will be to. I tell everybody I know about this movie, and every one of them praised me for it. I've read all the reviews, plus I frequently read the IMDb message board for this movie. It kind of reassures me, I'm not the only one who ""gets"" it. Pass it along!

73,12 June 2015,aciessi,9, Fall-Down Funny and Touching,"Of all of the films that span the career of Bill Murray, I may have found my all-time favorite. Groundhog Day is a heartwarming film. A true one, not some clichéd schmaltz you normally associate romantic comedies with. This, to me, is in the same league as Capra. The best film made by the late, great, Harold Ramis. It starts out as the sarcastic comedy that Murray and Ramis are known for (in the vein of Ghostbusters). Then it turns into a psychological dark comedy, of which we follow Phil's decent into madness in cheery Punxsutawney. Then, a romantic comedy, that pays tribute to that age old premise of going back in time, to get the girl. C'mon, you've all had that desire. Then, something really special happens. We see Phil, not only mastering his sensitivity with women, but with humanity, period. Suddenly, Murray transforms into the world's greatest good samaritan, after spending so much time taking advantage of everyone. This is what you call, ingenious story and character development. It's wholesome, but not saccharine. It's incredibly funny and really, unexpectedly touching.",

Ironically, for a film about repeating the same, titular day ad infinitum, it's tantalizingly rewatchable. This goes beyond some fantastic wish fulfillment for power, immortality and perfection offered by the time loop. It's a romantic comedy that, among other things, explores the cinematic reflexivity of the time-travel movie while touching on grand philosophical and religious questions.",
75,26 April 2018,tbills2,8," Groundhog Day Is Hilarious, Quality Film Making, A Genuine Feel Good Classic, Bill Murray At His Best!","Punxsutawney Phil driving the stolen truck with Phil is one of the most classic funny scenes I've ever seen. I would say this is Bill Murray's best work, but you've seen What About Bob, haven't you? Yes, you have. Bill's the best, the sweetest, he's really pretty funny. This is Harold Ramis' best screenplay, enough about Bill and Harold, you've seen Andie MacDowell, haven't you? Andie's so gorgeous, so sweet. It'd be pretty nice to spend an eternity with Andie reliving February 2 over and over again in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Not as nice as a lifetime though. Phil Connors wakes up at 6:00 AM to Sonny and Cher 'I Got You Babe' every morning in the same bed and breakfast in the same small town in the same Groundhog Day dream until he learns to love right consequently discovering the real beauty of life thus moving onward to a new day, or Phil has to go from a glass is half empty kind of guy to a glass is half full kind of guy, that about sums it up for me.

76,17 April 2020,eminkl,9, Worthy of annual viewings,"Doesn't everybody know this one? Bill Murray plays a generally bitter, unpleasant weatherman who turns on the charm while the cameras roll but tumbles backward into mean, icy sarcasm just as soon as he's out of the frame. Forced to relive the same day on an endless loop, a much-loathed Groundhog's Day on-location report, he slowly works through his issues, loses the chip on his shoulder, finds personal fulfillment and learns how to share a meaningful moment. It's a simple idea, thoughtfully explored, that doesn't run short on heart, ideas or surprises. Murray is perfect in the role, able to convincingly evolve from contemptible jerk to charismatic goofball, but it's the in-between steps that really make his journey remarkable. His growth doesn't come without pains and struggles, missteps and setbacks, and we share his agony over those tough lessons and bitter disappointments. By the time his sentence in that circular purgatory is at an end, he's hit rock bottom, explored his darkest impulses, reached out for salvation, failed, improved and found peace within himself. Andie MacDowell is adorable as Murray's co-star, the ever-optimistic, spritely target of our affections, while director Harold Ramis gives the whole package a warm, friendly sensibility that keeps things on the up-and-up and still allows some wickedly dark material to sneak through. A fantastic, character-driven comedy with laughs to spare and sweet, enduring lessons to teach.",

At first glance, this is just another romantic comedy, that will relax, endear you and make you laugh, but with every new watching, more and more I realize the multilayeredness and depth of its story. ""Groundhog Day"" is a philosophical study of human nature and life, subtly packaged in the form of excellent comedy, with a rarely well-written script, which has picked up a bunch of awards and nominations. It's a shame that it's not even nominated for an Oscar. I rarely watch movies more than once or twice, but this one I have seen at least ten times and I will re-watch it at least as many times.",
78,2 February 2017,ironhorse_iv,8, Groundhog Day is worth repeat viewings. It's just that watchable!,"Seeing how today is Feb 2, a.k.a. the actual in-real-life Groundhog Day holiday. It's the right time to watch this science fiction comedy, written by Danny Rubin and directed by Harold Ramis. After all, this movie has one of the most fascinating, existentialist premise, ever given for a film; in which, asked, 'What would you do if you were stuck, reliving one day, for the rest of your existence""? This is what happens to cranky, yet smarmy, Pittsburgh weather forecaster Phil Connors (Bill Murray), whom awakened, everyday knowing that he has lived the same day, millions of times. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while 'Groundhog Day' isn't the first movie to use the time loop trope, as that would be 1945's British horror movie, 'Dead of the Night', it did massively popularized the time loop trope to the point, that other films like 2011's 'Source Code' & 2014's 'Edge of Tomorrow', were greenlit to bring their own spin to the genre. However, none of those films were comedies. So, in the end, ""Groundhog Day' is in a league of its own. It's uniquely funny, well-written and with Bill Murray at his deadpan best. You really get to see Phil's character arch at work, here as he tries to both adjust to and escape from his bizarre dilemma. I like how the movie works from irresponsible, self-centered hedonism to suicidal despair to an insane number of time-consuming distractions, to finally, finding his own unexpected potential for self-growth and redemption, leading to a possibility arises that tomorrow might come for Phil after all. Bill Murray was amazing in the way, he was able to show, all of those range of emotions. Even the supporting cast was, fun to be, with. Andie MacDowell was great as the kind-hearted TV producer, Rita Hanson, while Chris Elliot was hilarious, as the cameraman, Larry. While, Stephen Tobolowsky as Ned Ryerson was a bit annoying and hammy. He was alright for the short period of time, his character was used. It's was also nice to see future-famous actor, Michael Shannon in one of first films. Not only was the acting, great; but director Harold Ramis also uses sound and music to great comic effect. One of those was the ironically cheery Sonny and Cher song 'I Got You, Babe', which will clearly get stuck in your head, for better or for worse. Another great thing, Ramis and his crew did well, was use repetition to great effect. In a lesson trained, director, this movie could had easily to be boring, but somehow his crew, were able to make, seeing repetitive scenes, seem worthy rewatchable. They did this, by adding so much detail in the background, while also giving us, something new to look at, while using the same footage, by introducing sub-characters and key items, slowly. Another great thing, they added, was a lot of scenes that foreshadows, future events, yet also leave much to the viewer's interpretation, since many of the visuals can be used as a metaphors such as ice sculptures. One such example is the use of the blue opening where Phil describe his ideal home. While, it looks like vast emptiness, if you look deeply into it, the weather scene really does describe, what Phil wants, from life, as it secretly shows his selfishness and lack of concern for others, while also casting a shadow on him, both physically and mentally. In many ways, the main character is no different than the groundhog in a Plato's 'allegory of cave', kinda of a way. Another thing, worth noting is the use of author Joyce Kilmer's 'tree', poem for its use of personification and anthropomorphic imagery. At first, Phil believes that he is the center of the universe, only to find out after Phil reads this work, that he isn't, and only by better himself and others, can he be happy with his existence. I also glad the movie cut certain scenes, such as the reasons, why the time loop started, as it was originally plan to be started with an ex-girlfriend of Phil's putting a voodoo curse on him in order to get revenge. In my opinion, it could had ruin the film purpose. It's better to leave the reasons, why the time loop, unsolved. In many ways, these examples are why people see the movie as a spiritual transcendence 'Carpe Diem' type of a movie. It's really hard to find any faults of this film's message, because of that. However, after this movie release, several writers emerged, claiming that the story was stolen from their idea such as science fiction authors, Richard Lupoff and Ken Grimwood. In truth, the inspiration for this film was the 1892 story ""Christmas Every Day"" by William Dean Howells, along with 1905 novel ""The Strange Life of Ivan Osokin"" by P.D. Ouspensky. Overall: I have to say, this is a great movie, even if certain scenes were a bit unpleasant and somewhat disturbing. I can also overlook a few goofs in the time versions where certain people and events shouldn't had happen, but did, because how well-written, well-acted, and very positive and moving, the rest of the movie, was. Because of this, the film is considered a modern classic. It's just sad that, during filming, Ramis and Murray's longtime collaboration and friendship ended abruptly, without public explanation, due to Murray undergoing a divorce at the time of filming. At least, it's good to say, they reconciliation, before Ramis death in 2014. In the end, I'm glad, they did, because along with 1984's 'Ghostbusters', this movie is one of the best works, they ever did well with each other. So, thank you, Harold Ramis and Bill Murray for all the laughs. You two, really do deserve the praise on how good this movie was.",

To make matters crazier, he's the only one who even notices this! While most movies would probably try to use this premise as an excuse for a bunch of silly gags, ""Groundhog Day"" uses it to show how Phil changes: he starts out a sour, cynical jerk, and slowly but surely grows more human as the movie passes. That's not to say that the movie doesn't allow for some goofy scenes. Among other things, Phil memorizes every event that's going to happen every day (""I am God!

As I watched numerous times over the years, I love it. I think this movie has great lessons aimed to the viewer. We have Phil Connors (Bill Murray), a T.V. weatherman out of Pittsburg, P.A.. He will be going for the 4th time in a roll to Punxsutawney, P.A.. Along with him is Rita( the producer) for WPBH; and Larry(Chris Elliott). Phil hates covering the festival, and everything about it. He is hateful, obnoxious, paranoid, and somewhat of a snob. As soon as they get there, Phil can't wait to leave. He just wants to get the coverage, dehumanize his co-workers as well a some of the locals. Once they get the coverage start to leave a big snowstorm hits, closing down the highways. Once back in Punxsutawney, Phil starts to have a case of Deja Vu or so he thinks. The movie cuts and we see Phil in the bed at the bed and breakfast. The alarm goes off and he wakes to the Sonny and Cher song I've Got U Babe. He wakes as is usual self grumpy; and the radio is playing the same music, saying the same lines as the day before. He is stuck in Groundhog Day again and he's like W.T.F.. As the movie goes along he starts learning how to become a better human being, but the day will start over again if he fails to learn from his mistakes. As the movie proceeds we see Phil develop a romantic relationship with Rita, help a homeless man by bonding with him, take up piano lessons; and come to the aid of Buster( Brian-Doyle Murray)who was choking. This movie is about feelings, relationships, and humanity. This is a touching story, sometimes we forget how to treat each other with respect.

I have yet to dig up my published review, so I am going to do this review off a recent viewing on Groundhog Day 2009. What a wonderful movie, dare I say a comedic masterpiece? (Okay, I will, and damned if I will be criticized, but it is still my opinion. Still on top-ten best comedies. So, there.) I believe I have it 5/5 stars back then, and still do. This movie still holds up extremely well, 16 years after originally released. The comedy is still dead on, the emotion and the romantic scenes are also spot on. All the lines were hilarious: ""What if there was no tomorrow? There wasn't one today!"" ""That sums it up for me"" (and does for me, too, unfortunately) and the long ""I am a god. I'm not thee God"" scene was masterful. I love how they never explain how it happens, they just allow the repeated day happen multiple times (no actual count, another great aspect) and have Bill Murray's Phil learn how to be a decent individual. Absolutely holds true, even if were made today. Only difference if it were made today: everyone would have cell phones. And even then, they would play it off as if the cell tower was damaged in the storm. Funny story: after watching the movie again on 2/2/09, I came into work on Tuesday the 3rd, and asked my boss to make sure it was 2/3 and he said it was.

104,29 September 2014,byson5186,10, How We Spend Everyday,"I only saw this movie once with my parents on Groundhogs Day, 2013. I didn't even know what the movie was about, not even knowing that the plot would be about a day repeating itself over and over. So, yeah while only seeing this movie one time, the plot is memorable along with the messages from the movie. To me personally, I can't think of any movie that has ever left me with a more positive message than this movie. Most movies will try to leave you with a good life message, but this movie has a very powerful message. Let's think about this movie in perspective trying not to use any spoilers. Well, Groundhog's Day is a holiday and one of the smaller holidays, a holiday most of us probably don't think much about except on February 2nd. It's not like Halloween which is coming up where we're already seeing decorations and costumes out, or Christmas where in 2 months we will see a lot of Christmas decorations along with hearing Christmas music on many radio stations. Groundhog's Day is mostly like a regular day where school doesn't get canceled or anything, and we find out on the news depending on if the Groundhog sees his shadow if we will have an early Spring or 6 more weeks of winter. In this movie, a weatherman known as Phil played by Bill Murray goes with his team to a certain town in Pennsylvania to do a report on the annual Groundhog's Day ceremony. After Phil stays with his team there another night because of a snowstorm, he notices he wakes up not to the next day, but the previous day Groundhog's Day, and the same thing seems to happen over and over and no matter how Phil spends his day, it just seems to continually repeat itself. Nobody else is aware of this time loop and it seems like everything goes the same way with the rest of the community during the day, only Phil can change the events happening by anticipating what is going to happen. So, basically the message this movie has taught me, is how we have everyday a period of 24 hours and we are the ones who decide how to spend the time each day. Most of the things we do each day are probably based on routine and habit, which is a good reason to get into good habits making somethings more natural to us. Obviously, we have countless opportunities of what we can do every single day with our time. Interestingly, we often times look back and are amazed at all the time that has passed from memorable moments, thinking the time flies. However, this movie shows how we spend are time in a single day and what we can do with all those opportunities, doing different things if a day keeps repeating itself, and getting different things from what we choose to do, like Phil chose to learn how to play the piano and get to know the community. So, basically each day is an opportunity in our life to do something, even things we've never done before. I personally am amazed at all we can do in a single day. I thought about that when I ran Cross Country in College, some days we would run 10 miles on scenic routes in the middle of nowhere on a day where we had classes, and a school night. We'd get back in time for dinner and to do homework. It was interesting to see myself in places I'm normally at on vacations in just an afternoon during a Cross Country practice along with getting good exercise and seeing the beautiful world. So, we might not be able to see the end from the beginning like Murray could. But, often times we don't take chances in life and miss out on opportunities we have because we are too afraid and don't try and unlike Phil some of those opportunities we have now, never come back. It's up to us to do what we can as I read earlier today on the internet, ""If You Think Adventure Is Dangerous, Try Routine It's Lethal."" The plot of a time loop has also been a plot in other movies like one more recently with Zachary Gordon, ""Pete's Christmas,"" which wasn't nearly as good as this is. But, we just need to think about how we spend are time and what we do, and we will get results. Some of those results will last a lifetime. I'd give this movie a 10/10. While it's not one of my favorite movies, not like one I'd care to own. I give it a 10/10 because of the positive message it leaves us with.",

Him carrying a film is not too promising to me, but I'm starting to doubt that since I've been enjoying his films more and more lately.

I think I was about 7 when this movie came out and I was one of those kids that would watch a movie on repeat for weeks on end and this was one of my favorites.

But this was one of those rare comedies that I watched, not necessarily for the next laugh, but I watched to see how the story would unfold. I wanted to see how Phil's character (Bill Murray) would develop while being stuck on this constant loop of Groundhog Day over and over. The movie made me think, ""What would I do if I were stuck in the same situation?"" You get to see Phil mature before your eyes, if not out of desire, then out of boredom or necessity. After initially fulfilling one selfish goal after another (with women, food, and even suicide) Phil decides to submit to his kinder, gentler, unselfish side, and he begins to embrace life in the town of Punxsetawney, Pennsylvania. After learning so much about the people and about communal life in general, he learns to love more than just himself. The movie was very heart-warming and inspirational. Groundhog Day was a terrific format to convey this type of story.",
114,12 February 2021,Uriah43,8, Reliving Deja Vu All Over Again,"""Phil Connors"" (Bill Murray) is a television weatherman for WPBH in Pittsburgh who has an elevated opinion of himself and looks down at everyone else. Although he isn't looking forward to it he has been tasked to go to the small Pennsylvanian town of Punxsutawney to cover the annual event where a groundhog named ""Punxsutawney Phil"" (a groundhog actually named ""Scooter"") is brought out to supposedly predict whether there will be an early spring or a late winter. So after giving the afternoon forecast in which he predicts that a snowstorm will not hit the area, he leaves for Punxsutawney with his new producer ""Rita Hanson"" (Andie MacDowell) and his cameraman ""Larry"" (Chris Elliott). Naturally, being the disagreeable person that he is, it is arraigned for Phil to stay at a local bed & breakfast rather than the hotel which Rita and Larry have chosen to stay. The next morning-on Groundhog Day-Phil does his usual broadcast and eventually retires for the day. However, when he wakes up a 6:00 A.M. the next morning it's Groundhog Day once again--and everything is exactly the same. Needless to say, this disturbs him very much and after going through the motions one more time again retires for the day-only to find that when he wakes up--its Groundhog Day once again. It's then that he discovers that he has been trapped inside a time loop and there is nothing he can do to escape. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fascinating comedy which--ironically enough--never seems to get old. I especially liked the performances of both Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell who seemed tailor-made for their parts. Likewise, the scenes in which Phil attempts to seduce ""Nancy Taylor"" (Marita Geraghty) was also quite amusing as well. In any case, I found this to be a most enjoyable comedy and I have rated it accordingly.",

The movie is about a stuck up news reporter who finds himself in his home town reliving Groundhog Day over and over again. This movie is good because it is clever, original and funny or hilarious as I should say. This Bill Murray movie is probably my equal favourite one with him in it to The Man Who Knew too Little.

I belive 'Groundhog Day' explores that happiness depends on our capacity to love. There's a spectrum of beauty, and it is effortless to see the beauty at a museum or watch a sunset, but can you see the beauty of everyday life of the most mundane ugly things. To live the greatest life possible is just none other than to see beauty everywhere. Love is a universal property, it's fundamental. It's not a sexual attraction or a romance, therefore, Unconditional love is the absolute acceptance of everything even the bad things. The reason that the universe could say has love is because the universe accepts itself completely without judgement. It's not resisting any part of itself, it loves every piece of itself. It's a love so deep that you can't even imagine what evil is because you love everything so much that there's no more room left for evil to exist. Love is the ability to be conscious of the beauty of creation. This great movie makes me realise the beauty of creation.",

I love this movie, and I have since I was little. Many kids were first introduced to Bill Murray in films like Ghostbusters or Caddyshack, or simply just by watching him on SNL. For me, my introduction to Murray was from this film, and personally, it's one of my favorite performances from him. The range he is willing to show with his character on screen is really dumbfounding. There is still the hilarious genius we have come to love, but also such a greater depth to him than we have seen in his other works. Harold Ramis provides the script for the film, a deeply original and unique story, as well as the direction, which is perfect in every sense of the word. I feel the pacing is what makes this film so good, because they easily could have made it a comedy and forgotten all about timing and the drama efforts it involves, but its storytelling is so carefully crafted and well-orchestrated you can't help but feel in awe as it makes you feel so much year after year. It may not be as old as some classics like It's a Wonderful Life or as well recognized as Ghostbusters but Groundhog Day is simply a timeless masterpiece that I hope more generations will find and recognize for years to come.

This one is based on an amazing concept, and has much more ambitious, existentialistic themes, almost in the vein of art-house movies, yet without ever feeling pretentious. It manages to be as thought-provoking and clever as movies by Stanley Kubrick, Michael Haneke or Lars von Trier, but it's told in such a light manner that it's much easier to grasp for mainstream audiences. Therefore it's able to almost sneak its themes in on those, who perhaps aren't normally used to thinking about the movies they watch. To me that's a great accomplishment in itself. GROUNDHOG DAY shows how we shouldn't take the important things for granted, that we should make the most of the time we are given on Earth, and that if the world feels like a terrible place, the changes must come from within yourself.",

That it went on to define its own whole narrative subgenre is a bit of a testament to how incredibly fresh and smartly assembled the trip down the rabbit (or groundhog) hole really is.

164,7 August 2019,garethcrook,9," ""I'm A God""","Groundhog Day has taken on a life way beyond its 90s comedy status. The day itself before, was known only in America as being synonymous with the weather. That completely changed when the late Harold Ramis wrote this Bill Murray vehicle. Now it's a worldwide pop-reference for repetition. So simple, utterly fantastic, absolutely hilarious and much more than just an endless loop. Has Bill Murray ever starred in a bad film? Probably, but I don't think I've seen it. Murray you always feel is playing his characters with a good dash of himself included. Bill doesn't give does he and neither does is character here, whether it's nasty Bill at the start or the reborn nice Bill at the end, Bill still has his edge. He feels so natural, it's easy to believe it's all improvised. He's brilliant. Andie MacDowell is the opposite, she's bloody annoying, as sickly sweet as the small American town in which it's set. There's an odd message to this film though, it seems to be about redemption, a bad soul making amends, but there's an undercurrent of manipulation that's quite sinister and points out some of the worst elements of some human nature. True, Phil does eventually find redemption after a lot of soul searching, comedy japes, worthwhile life experiences and deep suicidal depression... hey even that's given a light hearted twist. But it's troubling to see how long it takes him... an estimated 34 years! I love rewatching these kind of films, it's amusing to spot little things you may have missed before, be it little details or even actors, who were unknown at the time, like Michael Shannon playing the newly-wed Wrestlemania enthusiast. Yes it's schmaltzy romcom territory, complete with an end sequence that doesn't quite add up in the interests of happiness, but despite a few formulaic tropes, Groundhog Day is masterful. The premise, the arc, the characters (annoying or not), the intentionally choppy timeline, all of it barrels along beautifully... and at its centre, Bill Murray. ""I'm A God, I'm not The God"". Bill, I couldn't agree more.",

166,1 October 2005,moonspinner55,7," Hardly profound, but likable enough...","""Groundhog Day"" is a satisfying comedy marked by some whimsy and an unexpected and sweet romance. Bill Murray doesn't stretch much playing a nasty, uncouth TV weatherman, unhappily covering Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who is forced by fate into reliving the same 24hr day over and over until he becomes a better person. As written by Harold Ramis (who also directed) and Danny Rubin from Rubin's original treatment, the film is surprisingly inventive considering it has to face a fatigued sort of repetition. The colorful, uniformly excellent supporting cast is a big help to Murray, who doesn't go through as many changes as one might hope (he stays pretty much the same until the picture's third act). Ramis keeps a breezy, effortless pace--and he knows how to touch our hearts without getting maudlin (no small feat). Fresh-faced Andie MacDowell once again provides us with a delightful love-interest, playing the woman Murray intends to win if only he can modify his bad manners. Cantankerous leading characters can sometimes be a drag on the screen, even if their slow-building rehabilitation is done with a gentle touch; here, Ramis and Rubin team with their star to create an irritable, grouchy human being and manage to make him both funny and endearing. *** from ****",

This truth really sinks in for celebrity weather reporter Phil Connors in returning to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover Groundhog Day. Oddly enough, he wakes each morning at the same time and place as the morning before and, unlike everyone else, retains memories from the proceeding day. At first Phil, selfish and shallow, utilizes the new-found knowledge to take advantage of others; stealing the hearts of beautiful women and bags of money. Telling people what they want to hear, of which he has uncanny knowledge, works like a charm. This is until he attempts to woo Rita, the network producer. Phil works relentlessly to get into her head and appear to like everything she likes; French poetry, the piano, acting spontaneously, ice cream and kids, yet Rita is not so easily deceived. No matter what he does, she sees right through him. To win Rita's heart, Phil must change his own.",

The issue is the introduction of Jan Lokpal Bill- a bill that employs tougher measures to root out corruption. Anna, with his countless fasts and the government's constant rejection of the former's proposed bill is entering into a log jam. The Indian news channels that cover this issue keep rambling every single day without even throwing light on other issues like the zeroing in on Gaddafi etc. Whenever I switch to the news channels, I feel so bugged by the repetitiveness that I switch over to movies, and that boredom got me to Groundhog Day, and I was actually delighted by the movie.

Lots and lots of funny moments in this uniquely (at the time) structured film, and whether you're a Murray fan or not, there should be enough in those scenes to make you at least partake in the fun. This movie has this sort of a contagious grip on the viewer like it's a kind of game (as Murray's day keeps on repeating on perpetual loop). A movie that's had many generations laugh out loud, and movie-makers directly inspired from it. In the madness of his ""now-daily routine"", Murray seeks redemption, and isn't that endless loop perhaps a metaphor (that he wasn't doing the right thing in his daily life), and highly reminiscent of the perpetual torments in Greek mythology ? Comedy classic. Should be seen.",

173,15 June 2015,bbewnylorac,8, Really great film,"This film works on two levels - as a wacky comedy, and as a deep meditation on life. We've all known someone like Phil (Bill Murray), the nasty, burnt-out TV weather man who hasn't got a good word to say to anyone, who is cynical about everything and impossible to get along with. Life has been bad to him, so he's going to be nasty back. In Groundhog Day, by having to live the same day over again and again, it slowly dawns on him that his life can improve, but it's going to take some effort on his part. For example, actually learning to be nice to his camera man. To me, the best scene is when Phil walks into a bar, and declares in despair that it's always the same day. A drunk at the bar remarks that that's what his own life is like. Like a lot of people in real life, I thought. Stuck in the same rut like Phil, self destructing, committing crimes, over-eating and running into the same old people, until they can find a way to break out and make the most of life. The only thing I don't like about this film is Rita, the love interest. She's great when she's producing his weather segment and telling him off for being such a slob, but I felt the romantic resolution was too twee and weird. It's like he finally learns how to manipulate a woman into going out with him. Isn't there something wrong with that? But perhaps I'm too cynical. Maybe it's just that he learns how to love someone.",

181,20 May 2012,fredericksmith1952,8, Groundhog Day is one of those films you either love or hate.,"No in between, no take it or leave it. Everyone has an opinion, and surprisingly they all appear to be valid. I fall on the ""love it"" side of the equation, but I am a huge Bill Murray fan. Everyone knows a Bill Murray, the guy who wants to do something just wrong enough to get him fired and just right enough to be fun. Bill's character in this film is at the stage in his life where he is totally focused on advancing his career, regardless of what happens to those around him, which is why he cannot advance his career. Chris Elliot as Larry the cameraman is resolved to his role in life, observing the lives of others and getting his paycheck at the end of the day. Maybe Chris wanted to try a straight role for once, maybe there was only room for one comedian in the film, but Chris actually contributes little to the film. Andie MacDowell is the naive, wide eyed beginning producer who really doesn't care about her job as much as she cares about her own agenda. Only in her case, she isn't willing to step over or on people to get where she needs to be in life. Personally I like this film because it is an exhaustive study on the transition of a man through circumstance from an ass to a man. Rated PG for a couple of sexual situations and some violence, I'd say the teens would not be offended, but I doubt they will get it. Collectible if you like Murray, or just like an interesting play on Karma.",
182,24 May 2007,spacefoo,10, Uplifting and truly unique,"There are few films in which you can watch and genuinely feel uplifted and can make you feel like every day is important...this is one of them. A truly special film. It follows Phil Conners (Bill Murray) a TV weatherman man who pretty much hates his life, and the world around him- he's cold, and drips sarcasm and dry humour and no one really knows him. But its not one of those yawn inducing romance movies, where the bad man turns good because of love instantly- this is a much smarter movie, the premise is unique as Phil aims to get his report over with, in Punxatawney to cover the groundhog day, as quickly as possible and get out. He can't stand the town, and finds the whole day utterly pointless. Thus the groundhog day commences at 6am and his radio alarm awakes him to two radio presenters ""Its groundhog day..."" after the quirky ceremony he tries to get out of town but his own weather report lets him down as the storm forces him to stay another day. What he doesn't realise is this is a day he may have to re-live for the rest of his life. He awakes to exactly the same day and events as the previous one- and continues to do so. From this point on Phil goes through many stages: At first he treats the repeated days with contempt; then he continues his personality of dry ego-centric and impersonal, by using it to his advantage- by picking up women rather impressively i might add, living it with reckless abandon with the realisation there are no consequences stealing,arrested; then the next stage was that of being suicidal- as he commits suicide every day as this repeated day was a curse; however as the movie develops so too does his interest in the sweet good natured Rita Andie McDowell character, whom he woos and romances and he uses each day to develop his knowledge of her. He gets a lot of slaps in the face as he attempts to use it to bed her in one go; but this soon gives him a reason to keep going, and he over time develops an excitement in his life and re-living it as he starts doing good in the community helping people and sculpturing and playing and instrument and his nature changes to one of good... and he finally gets groundhog day right- it all comes together for him and he gets his girl, and he feels genuinely uplifted as he awakes the next day with Rita beside him and he finally made it to the next day.",

Who would have thought that Harold Ramis, crown prince of the slob comedy, and Bill Murray, an actor whose specialty is looking disinterested, would combine to create a work of this caliber? ""Groundhog Day"" eschews cheap laughs and throwaway gags for something much richer, deeper and more sophisticated. The idea of someone living the same day over and over again, until he finally gets it right, is absolutely ingenious. The transformation of this character in the process is a revelation and a joy to watch. ""Groundhog Day"" is truly sublime, one of the best motion picture comedies ever.",

Projecting nothing but facile sarcasm, ironic self-awareness and aloof detachment, Connors is a thoroughly postmodern man, his life long filled with what he perceives to be pointless and mindless routine. But Connors is not a pessimist or self-centred, so much as he is super-aware, perpetually dejected and world-weary. For Connors, every day offers only what philosopher Francois Cusset called the ""dead end of postmodernity"". Enchantment is thoroughly dead and everything that will happen has already happened.",

Murray's character's inability to accept that he can not keep the old man alive when it's the old man's day to die is a movie moment that always brings tears to my eyes.",

I enjoyed it much more at the age of 29 than I did at the age of 17! At that younger age, the romance in this movie seemed too cheesy for me to take, but I can now see the movie as a decent romance, but mostly just a great comedy. It's sort of an existential comedy, it really puts its character in the place of having to question the value of his life. Since he can't even make the choice to end his life, in a way he's stuck in ""the Myth of Sysyphus"" and can't rise above it until he stops fighting it and lets other people affect him. It reminds me of the more recent film ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" in this way.",

214,24 January 2010,Bunuel1976,7," GROUNDHOG DAY (Harold Ramis, 1993) ***","While I had always been aware of this film's considerable reputation, it took me this long to get acquainted with it; in retrospect, I feel the picture to be deserving of the epithet ""modern comedy classic"". It deals with an original – and for the genre, singular – concept: a literal case of multiple deja'-vu experiences (in all fairness, the minor sci-fi entry THE TIME TRAVELERS [1964] had already delved into the theme, though obviously lacking the skill and polish realized here). Bill Murray tackles one of his best roles, actually a variation on the actor's own characterization in the much inferior SCROOGED (1988), which I watched only last week; now he is an arrogant (can he play any other way?) Weather Man assigned to the unexciting titular event in Pennsylvania – eager to get out of there, he not only finds the passage blocked by a snowstorm but, by some unexplained quirk of nature, finds himself reliving the same day over and over again! At first, he is understandably baffled and frustrated by all of this – especially in the face of the obliviousness to his predicament shown by colleagues and townspeople alike; then, he is amused by the sheer predictability of the day's proceedings; gradually, however, he learns to take advantage of this state-of-affairs – not only involving himself in the everyday life of the town, but also striving to better himself (such as becoming an accomplishment piano-player or a hand-craft artisan seemingly in the space of single day); most of all, however, he works at cultivating a loving relationship with Andie McDowell, the producer of his TV program who, normally, cannot stand him! Apparently, Murray and director Ramis (co-stars in STRIPES [1981], another recent viewing, and the GHOSTBUSTERS films) fell out during the making of this one because they had contrasting opinions about the prevailing tone of the script: Murray wanted it to be of a more philosophical bent, while Ramis thought better of extracting the comic potential out of the central situation; in the end, I feel the film strikes a good balance between the two (with plenty of visual gags and assorted mayhem but, at the same time, having a definite bittersweet side to it – in view of the above-mentioned budding romance and also Murray's numerous failed suicides!).",

218,26 September 2003,Aaron1375,9, Murray at his best.,"This film was a rather big movie of I think early 1993.  It was one of the best comedies of that year and won over more people on its release on video. I didn't care to see it at first, but watched it when it came on cable and it won me over too.  The story has a somewhat grumpy weatherman sent to a city to do a story on the Groundhog there and the festival surrounding it. I know the name of the city, but I am not even going to try to spell it.  He hates the idea and wants to get out of there as fast as he can. Unfortunately, a blizzard hits and he has to stay longer (a blizzard he predicted would miss the area).  So he stays the night and the next morning starts out eerily the same as the previous.  At first he thinks it is just a coincidence, but realizes soon enough that the day is repeating over again. It continually repeats throughout the movie and you get to see Murray begin to loath the town and then fall in love with it.  No real explanation is given for why the day repeats, but none is really needed and it is amusing to watch Murray go through the city knowing exactly when and where things will happen and getting to know all the people as well.  The movie takes kind of a somber twist near the end when some scenes involving a homeless man come up, but it doesn't stay somber instead going for a more positive, funny conclusion.  I love the scene with the kid in the tree.  How long he stays in the day is anyone's guess, but I figure he had to be there a good 15 years worth of days...my friend informs me it takes a while to master a piano that well.  This is a very funny and entertaining movie that is heart warming as well.  I also have to give it a chuckle cause of all the time he spent trying to pursue the one lady played by McDowell...It does take forever to win over the best gals out there doesn't it?  Chris Elliot is also in this one, but don't let that scare you off, he is actually rather good and doesn't detract from the movie at all.  All in all a very good comedy, bravo Harold Ramis.",

Basically TV meteorologist Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the news story of Groundhog Day festivities in the town, with his producer Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott). The day seems pretty dull and ordinary for Phil, with some irritations along the way, but the next morning, the same 6:00am alarm playing Sonny and Cher's ""I Got You Babe"" repeats, as do all the events of Groundhog Day that Phil experienced. It happens again, and with all memory of his previous events, Phil is convinced he is stuck in a time loop, and for a while he takes advantage, including trying to woo Rita, which he fails at consistently. It becomes obvious he may be trapped like this, so he kills himself, but he is still alive, and tries again and again, but he still lives the same day. But with his knowledge of the same day events, Phil learns new skills and makes more friends, in order to become a saint to many people, including Rita. It is only when Rita finally agrees to stay with Phil through the night that Phil finally wakes at 6:00am to the next day, so your probably thinking that all along he was living the same day in order to be with Rita, a sweet thought. Also starring Stephen Tobolowsky as Ned, Brian Doyle-Murray as Buster, Marita Geraghty as Nancy, Angela Paton as Mrs. Lancaster, Scary Movie's Rick Ducommun as Gus and Rick Overton as Ralph. I can see how this could almost be a one joke comedy, but both the fantastic Murray and director Ramis do everything to keep you engaged.

The spell is broken when he finally gets it right, which appears to take 40 or 50 times. Chris Elliot (the cameraman) gives a surprisingly restrained performance and Andie MacDowell plays ""Rita"" the TV producer. She is a small town girl that wants a better life. Cleverly written with many plot twists. Every day is almost the same but slightly different. For example, Phil robs an armored truck, and dresses in a ""Superfly"" outfit complete with fancy car. His ""date"" dresses like a ""French Maid"". Such outrageous events do not repeat and happen only once.

It's so much fun watching Bill Murray's character change and evolve, and the scene in which he quotes Chekhov is touching and memorable.

And people that surround him also feel it, they feel negative energy from him, his egocentric nature. And when every day your life repeats, when nothing changing around you, you lose your desire to live. And then the second state - the main hero tries to satisfy his own desires, having every time in the world. But this didn't work for him. Then the third state he begins to learn new skills, to get new knowledge. It helps, but not satisfy him, nothing changes. And finally he understands that most important thing is to help others, to save more lives, to make more people happier. And from selfish man, that he was at first, he becomes a generous, very kind, and altruistic person.

of Murray's character in regard to his handling

265,4 December 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," Good, but hardly great","I'm not saying that this movie isn't funny... quite the contrary. But so many claim that it's great, almost a masterpiece... why? It starts out very good, with Bill Murray being his typical, sarcastic, at times deadpan self, and continue being so for a good while... but somewhere, about halfway through the movie, the films pace suddenly slows ridiculously down and we're suddenly not watching a comedy with Murray's sharp wit and excellent delivery, but rather a typical early 90's romantic comedy. Why couldn't this film break that damn barrier? Why does there always have to be romance? I know, I know, us humans have quite an insatiable lust and longing for love, but can't we think of something more original and constructive to put in movies? The film gets better a little later, with Murray doing more fun stuff again... and the plot is now turned around. The first half of the film is Murray doing what he feels like, pleasing himself, the latter half if him serving other people, pleasing others. This works well, and there are some funny moments in both parts(though there are far more in the first). But the whole romance subplot... I don't know, maybe it's because it's Andie MacDowell, the queen(well, one of them... another good example would be Julia Roberts, but she's done more versatile roles) of annoying romantic comedies. Why, oh why must there always romance in movies like this? Hell, the movie could have gotten an 8 from me, or possibly even a perfect 10, if it had kept up the great entertainment of the first half. Some of the movie also seems to drag a bit, since we're basically just watching the same thing over and over again... but with tiny alterations every once in a while. The plot is good, but the romance subplot sucks. The pacing is OK. The acting is somewhat good... but the only actor that impressed me was Bill Murray... and even he was portraying the exact same character that he always does. The characters are well-written... to a extent. The humor is good. All in all, the movie is worth watching and good, but it's by no means great. I recommend it to fans of Bill Murray and *shudder* romantic comedies. 7/10",

267,19 October 2012,phonenumberofthebeast,10, A simple tale that conceals surprising depth and meaning,"""Groundhog Day"" is a rare case of audiences actually being ahead of the critics. When this superficially simple tale of a self-obsessed weatherman (Bill Murray) who is forced to relive the same day over and over again was initially released, most critics, even the best, completely missed this movie's subtle and intricate take on the vagaries of life. They followed only its simple premise, slapstick humour and the great, sarcastic shadow of Bill Murray, who, as always, dominates every scene. Audiences, however, immediately took to it. Despite being released (appropriately) in February, the famine period of the movie calendar, ""Groundhog Day"" went on to gross over $70 million and became a sleeper hit later on video. Soon, the phrase ""It's like Groundhog Day"" began passing from mouth to mouth as a descriptor for any number of human situations, and Groundhog Day was better recognised as a metaphor than as a holiday. Today, ""Groundhog Day"" is recognised by the AFI and the Writer's Guild of America. ",
268,3 April 2020,Coffee_in_the_Clink,7, A charming and quirky film with an irresistible concept,"I didn't really like ""Groundhog Day"" the first time I watched it. I thought it was bland and the comedy elements didn't do it for me. But I gave it another watch and my opinion of it has greatly improved. It's a very charming comedy, with an irresistible premise, topped off by a fine performance from Bill Murray. Murray plays Phil Connors, an arrogant, sarcastic weatherman who begrudgingly travels to the town of Punxsutawney in Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day, where the locals gather to watch the unveiling of a hog and to find out if it'll be a long winter or an early spring. Phil is joined by his producer Rita and cameraman Larry. Just before they leave town, a blizzard cuts off the roads and they have to stay in the town another night. The next morning, Phil wakes up to the exact same day again, and when he realises that he is stuck in a loop, possibly condemned to live the same day forever, he starts to make it work for him, by doing crazy things and trying to make Rita fall in love with him. A film with a premise like this has an unlimited pool of ideas and possibilities to play out, which is certainly the appeal, and I think director Harold Ramis and writer Danny Rubin did a good job with what directions they chose Phil to take.",

Can't believe it took me this long to see it. Easily Bill Murray's best performance and the film is soooooooooo much better than the overrated GHOSTBUSTERS or CADDYSHACK or SCROOGED. Forget about it!! Great film with a genius story - about the same day repeating over and over. Yet the story doesn't bog down or become repetitive as the days begin repeating. Just the opposite. It becomes more and more engrossing. And how about that Stephen Tobolowsky as NED... NED RYARSON!!!! BING!!! I SURE AS HECKFIRE REMEMBER YOU!!! BING!! Hahaha!

271,14 September 2012,hugo-c-castelo,10," More than a funny movie, a life lesson","On this movie, Bill Murray ends up stuck in a rather boring day of his life. He's unhappy with his job and is covering by the third time in a row an event that has no meaning to him. At first he's skeptical and shocked with everything that's happening. He just wanted that day to end since the beginning. His plan was to get there on the night before, sleep, do his jog and go back to his city as soon as possible. But a snowstorm closes the road and his group is forced to spend one more night there and this night is the one that starts to repeat the day making Bill's character stuck. When he realizes what's happening and that there's nothing he can do about it he just stop caring. He drinks, smokes, mock the coverage and the city, steal and do everything he wouldn't do if he knew that the time would pass as normal. He tries to learn about things to use this knowledge in his favor. He ends up knowing everything about the city, the schedule, people's life and preferences. With that he's able to make the day go exactly as he wants to. Eventually he grow tired of it all and just want things to be normal again. Sure it was fun to lie and live the life as nothing bad could happen to him but he misses what we all got, the possibility of a future. And the great lesson we can get from the movie is to try. You don't need to live like this day is going to repeat forever but instead of wait and think about the consequences of your acts just do it. If you wanna do something, get out there and do it. If you don't do it you'll be like Bill's character but in a bad way. The days are going to pass but you'll be stuck always doing the same thing.",

I feel it is funny that the man fails to make advances to the heroine over and over. Taking the ending into consideration, we can understand she doesn't like his self-centered attitude. In contrast, I don't like the scene the man tries to kill himself. This is because I wonder whether he really needs to do such a thing. In my opinion, the director can show his feelings by using another way. Anyway, I really enjoyed watching this film throughout the whole. Therefore, I recommend every people to watch it.

The endless playing out, like variations on a theme, take us and the character far from the starting point. There are Faustian parallels here. Faust was not free until he was able to say ""Stay for thou art fair"",just as Groundhog day will recur until the errant weatherman realises that this day is perfect (better than that day in the Bahamas that he would have originally preferred.)And how refreshing it is not to have some glib ""explanation"" offered as to why this happened.

294,19 March 2005,jonnyabomb,8," Funny, deeply moving and original!","I wonder what Bill Murray made of this script when it landed on his doorstep. Surely it was going to be a winner as the Murray/Ramis partnership had been one that had bared fruit on a number of occasions already with titles such as Caddyshack, stripes and Ghostbusters all lodged firmly in the minds of movie goers as classic Murray fests. However, I sincerely doubt that he could have ever envisioned the success and popularity that this tale of a local weatherman reliving the same day over and over would go on to achieve at the box office and with fans alike. Murray is the best in the business at world weary cynicism and Phil Connors trial by time is at heart a simple story of a man forced to realise that in a place where nothing changes but himself that this is the only difference that truly matters. The Director Ramis claims to have received letters from people of all religions who have seen this movie and understand the message as one of their own following. In essence this is much more than a simple comedy and as Connors himself reminds us not to underestimate the significance of Groundhog Day.",

That alone is a staggering achievement, but this movie does it without being pretentious or preachy unlike much of modern Hollywood cinema.

You wake up, go to school or work, usual usual, come home to usual usual. You can abuse this, make a joke of it, kill some people, or help some people. Depending on how you approach it is what this day is actually about. The story is not so seemingly deep or preachy in the film as I may make it out because it is also entertainment which is how things should be looked back on. The worst experience is the most experience. Bill Murray's deadpan sarcasm adds to the amusement of this experience. I give the film ten stars because only a few films anymore leave an impression on me in a certain way. You see so many films and you get so bored and down with everyday sometimes you need to watch some douche deal with the same problem only in this film it's literal. A JPC recommendation goes to any film that leaves an actual impression on me where most others did not.

Too bad that the concept is only developed into a meagerly interesting final product. I've seen Edge of Tomorrow, which uses the same concept, but it ends up better for me due to it took the concept into a more serious matter. Nevertheless this movie can still have good grip on its main concept and took it into quite a good story with nice repeated scenes. Too bad that the ending is only about love and nothing else.

But the explanation is not needed for the film-goer - our treat is to live the predicament with Phil, to watch him try everything he can think of to get to tomorrow. The script is wonderfully tight, with no duff jokes and Bill Murray gives his best performance ever - his attempts to seduce Andie MacDowell have got to be seen to believed...hilarious!

And today,"If you've somehow found yourself watching the 2016 version of 'Ghostbusters' you may or may not have noticed some bloke popping up in the middle of the film, only to disappear as quickly. I barely spotted him. In fact, it took me until practically the end of the movie to realise it was Bill Murray, now reduced to a cameo in the film that – arguably – made him a household name. Whatever you think about the 'Ghostbusters' remake, after the original he was riding high and one of his follow-up roles (and possibly 'best') was as Phil Conners in 'Groundhog Day.' If you haven't watched it then, by now, you've probably seen a film that's – technically – based on it. The formula is a simple, if pretty basic one: a man is literally trapped in a day. No matter what he does, where he goes or who he meets, he simply wakes up the following morning in today. Since 'Groundhog Day' I've watched this format played out in all sorts of other films or TV programmes – everything from the 'X-files' did it, to variants of the genre such as incorporating horror and sci-fi to the mix. However, no matter how fun they were, none have really come close to watching a grown man kidnap a small rodent and take it for a joy ride through a quarry pit in small-town America.",

To say the least, Phil is VERY UNHAPPY and his giant ego makes him approach the project with scorn. True, this year he has a new producer, the very beautiful Rita (Andie McDowell), but even she doesn't lift the burden of boredom off his shoulders. While the rest of the crew makes due in a local hotel, Phil actually gets digs in a lovely bed and breakfast. In any case, Phil does his duty, very begrudgingly, putting up with the constant music of the Pennsylvania Polka and the ceremony of the ""little rat"". Then, a blizzard arrives. Everyone is stuck and Phil is unhappy. But, there's more. The next morning, Phil awakes to the same song as the day before, Sonny and Cher's I've Got You Babe, and finds he has to live the whole Groundhog Day experience AGAIN, even though everyone else is in happy oblivion that this is anything but the day itself. This means more polka, more little rat, more pushy insurance man trying to sell him a policy since he and Phil ""went to school together"", more plain coffee at the B and B. Making it through the second reliving, Phil wakes to a THIRD GROUNDHOG DAY, again. And again and again. Will Phil come to realize that HE HAS BEEN GIVEN A CHANCE to become a better man and win the girl of his dreams? This very funny film has the greatest idea at its base. If you were given the chance to relive a fateful day, would you change your behavior for the good? In Phil's case, it takes more than one day, of course. As the into-himself-weatherman, Murray is priceless and the cast surrounding him is wonderful, too.

""Groundhog Day"" ironically qualifies many times over. Bill Murray is just sensational as the ultimate curmudgeon who learns to change because he has to. Andie McDowell is not my favorite actress, but she truly shines in this romantic comedy classic. Now I could nitpick about somethings in the film like, like, ""How the Hell did he learn ice sculpture in such a short time?"" but comedy is the ultimate suspension of disbelief genre, but I still would like to know who did those fabulous cultures, the credit you rarely see you in end credits. Even Chris Elliott who usually annoys me has his moments. heck, I even liked the pairing of Rick Ducommon and Rick Overton (the latter with whom I have had less than warm moments) has two mildly lovable drunks. if you have never seen the movie before, and you like clever and engaging comedies, I can pretty much guarantee that you will fall in love with this movie unless you are as cynical and the earlier Murray character in this classic.

While the experiences he has in these loops are hilarious, ultimately, its a movie of redemption that will make it one to endure for the ages.

335,2 February 2022,nataliabatsko,7, And the day repeats itself over and over again!,"As I'm writing this review, the day is groundhog day! As you may know, this is the time of the year when the groundhog comes out of a tree and tells whether it will cold or warm for the next 6 weeks. This movie is about two things: the holiday itself and the feeling of Deja vu (when you feel like you already experienced something before)
The main character is Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who is a skeptic weatherman that had to do a news report in a small town about groundhog day. After a dreadful day for Phil ends, he wakes up and it's Groundhog day, again! He meets the homeless man and his ex classmate Ned Ryason again, hears the exact same song on radio and answers to the same questions that he already talked about yesterday. And it goes again and again. However, Phil comes up with lot's of ideas to make each day feel distinct, both in a good and a bad way. One time he stole a car and got hit by train, one time he tried to date pretty women, later he would eat lots of sugar, and then later, he would try to escape from this cursed town in many ways. There's also Rita (Andie Macdowell) who is the reason why Phil became nicer throughout the movie. Thanks to her, he learned how to play the piano and began to read French literature. Not only that, he also spent dates with Rita, playing in the snow and building snowmen. I honestly liked the chemistry between the two, which remind me of Beauty and the beast or Megamind and Roxanne Richi or even Hal and Rosemary from shallow Hal, because of the whole ""if you meet the right person, you will become a better one yourself"", which is actually a true statement in my opinion. Since it's also a comedy, it definitely has it's fair share of funny scenes: for example when Phil and the groundhog were riding a car away from the police. Or when Phil tried to convince Rita that he's a god, but not the God, because no matter what he tries, even his attempts at dying, he always comes back to February second. I won't say it's laugh out loud, since it's a more chill kind of a movie unlike What happens in Vegas or Beethoven where it's mostly humour (but has heart too), but it does give some positive moments to make sure that at least smiled. The moral is great too, to always be nice to people and try to do something new every day to make each one special.",

Bill Murray acts the way he wants to act, regarding performance, and we wouldn't want it anyway. He doesn't overplay it ether, as if in reality, this really did happen. He's a new anchor, who's in love with his assistant, Mcdowell, while her cameraman Elliott, is a quietly arrogant uncaring p...k. Murray too, cheats death, many times.

I am still of the opinion, although Murray's role in this movie is more significant - more than in his other movie where he stars excellently - ""Lost in Translation"". However, at times, windings of the plot are difficult to monitor and there are not too many scenes you can really laugh - and they are all related to Murray's lines. The best scene is where Murray is driving mad the car with two local rednecks and gives his views on life and future. The romantic angle with MacDowell is similar to most of movies with Meg Ryan.

I never saw it in the day and now in 2022 it seems perfect as the world is trying to find a ""new normal"". Love, as the song says, is the answer. Fantastic movie with a heart.",
366,1 January 2005,sirpetertheknight,8, I'm watching and writing about this right now!,"Groundhog Day is a glorious film that gives a hilarious and sometimes bleak view of what would happen if you had to live one day over and over. It's funny and enjoyable, and while it's greatness is different to, say, Citizen Kane or star Wars, it remains the best temporal displacement comedy (if not movie), and is one of the best romantic comedies. Murray is excellent as Phil, the disenfranchised, broken down, sarcastic weather man who finds himself going over groundhog day eternally. He is perfectly cast, and proves once again why he is one of the best comics who has ever lived. His deadpan face and sarcastic nature are used to full fury, and he is aided by a great supporting cast, including Andie McDowell in one of her not crap roles, and Steven Tobolowsky, who plays the hilariously annoying Ned Ryerson. This is a must see comedy for anyone who loves Murray, time altering or whatever. Brilliant.",
367,16 September 2006,rwkrok,9, Refreshingly unique,"Much has been said by other reviewers about the metaphorical aspects of this well written and acted film, so I won't waste time rehashing all that. Basically Bill Muray's character is forced into introspection and growth because the only element of his existence he is able to permanently change is himself. Murray is pretty good at this type of metamorphosis (see ""Scrooged""). While placing characters in situations that encourage or stimulate personal growth is common movie fare, the way it is accomplished here is really unique. In a world of so many copy-cat stories and variations on a theme this movie is brilliantly original. Oh yeah, the ""I got you, babe"" every morning as an indication we're still on groundhog day is priceless.",

Usually, you associate funny with dumb, but with groundhog day, you get one of the most intelligent comedies of all time. Mainly set around one day, which weatherman phil conners must relive over and over again, to his utter confusion, the film just throws out brilliant idea after brilliant idea. Bill Murray will probably never be better, his comic timing is superbly spot on. He could say even the most dull line, and make it funny. And without being intimidated, the supporting actors are all as equally good in their own parts. It gets rather sentimental as it moves on, but still doesn't quit with those great one liners. This movie should replace prozac.",
369,26 March 2004,gengar843,10, Awesome!,"SPOILERS One of my favorite films!  Just like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" Harold Ramis sets this quirky fantasy-romantic comedy in a small, snowy town.  Unlike Jimmy Stewart's character, however, Bill Murray's (one of my favorite actors of all time-- so, shoot me!) has virtually zero compassion factor at the start.  Through an unknown mechanism, our ""hero"" is forced to relive Groundhog Day over and over until he ""gets it right,"" that moral being in the hands of the filmmakers.  On the way from ruffian to sweetheart, Phil Connors gets his face slapped repeatedly, robs a bank, becomes a romantic scoundrel, commits various suicides, and generally runs rampant as he knows that tomorrow is NOT ""another day,"" but the same day!  Great fun and loads of laughs, smirks, and ""cool!""'s even after seeing more times that I can count.  When Phil finally starts to ""settle down"" after ""sowing his oats,"" the Capraesque elements start creeping in, until you are swimming in Americana, heroism, and sentimentality.  Granted, you have to like Bill Murray (which I do), and you have to enjoy the old-fashioned sensibilities that the movie wants to impart (and I do).  I give it 10/10. :-)",

He can take the premise of a man LITERALLY living the same day over and over and make a great movie out of it. I mean how can you not love the guy? His relatable and witty personality just makes up for some truly great stuff that he did with Harold Ramis and Columbia, like this film, Stripes and the original two Ghostbusters movies. Harold Ramis clearly loved Bill Murray as a friend and as a brother-from-another- mother and Groundhog Day is arguably the finest offering that cake from the two's collaborations.",

However, I think that for some reason, the people that gravitate toward this film also tend to be ""karma sympathizers"", slightly Hindu, or at least appreciate the spiritual parallels.If someone as cynical as Bill (Phil) can be redeemed on the day where for thousands of years, a small little animal has to choose between the dark and the light, than anyone watching knows they too can go out and be a better person. I had forgotten it was Paxsutawney Phil's day to shine till I looked at the news today, but just remembering that film, and its story line makes me want to go out and do something nice for my kids today. Maybe we'll go get cocoa before dance lessons- the sun is shining here! Happy Candlemas/Groundhog day to all...MM",

Watching Bill Murray going through the motions of the same day over and over again, is funny up to some point, then it gets increasingly scary. It's just not a very fun situation. I've never really seen the creepy side to that song ""I Got You Babe"", but there you have it. The movie doesn't really go for gags, it's just all so wacky and unpleasant at the same time. I don't know why kidnapping a groundhog is funny, it just is. However, it's likely that the real idea is actually a social comment. People don't have time anymore, nothing ever changes, live the day to its fullest, take your pick. That's probably the angle that separates this from a whole bunch of inferior comedies. It's nothing special, but it's nice that's it's there I guess. The ending was the best choice they could made I think, any bigger, more spectacular, more explanatory ending would have just been an anti-climax.

On the surface the story it looks like a situation comedy with Murray's character living the same Groundhog Day over and over.

Bill Murray easily gives one of his best performances and is perfectly cast. This is simply the best comedy Harold Ramis ever made up to now. This movie has had so many positive comments that there isn't much left to say actually. So I'm just here to throw in my two cents. Though the concept of reliving the same day over and over again is rather original to base a comedy on and the movie is build up flawless, having a lot of funny situations, it still is Bill Murray, with his almost natural sarcasm, that is the main attraction of this movie. I possibly couldn't have imagined another actor playing weatherman Phil Connors. Andie MacDowell was also perfect as Rita, the producer who was practically the complete counterpart of Phil. To put it simple: She loves life, Phil hates it. It even felt okay when those two become romantically involved at the end, 'cause you really want them to (with Rita having such a positive effect on Phil and all).",

The positive message and moral are well conveyed while still keeping a lighthearted, disengaged tone. Almost like a modern ""Christmas Carol"", with the exception that Phil's transformation does not happen overnight. Well, technically it DOES happen overnight, but from the characters' perspective, it actually took months, if not years, to go through a process of self-awareness, acceptance, and self-improvement.",

Except that he will be reliving the same day over, and over, and over, and over That's the premise of one of the best comedies I've ever seen: Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray and Andie McDowell. At first it might have seemed an ordinary comedy but when things started getting real weird and absurd is when Groundhog really takes flight and becomes an extraordinary story of perseverance, love and redemption. The reason I love Groundhog Day is that you start with a cynical and arrogant character named Phil (Bill Murray here at his very best) who unwillingly goes out on this special report about the Groundhog Day traditional annual event but would much rather be elsewhere. He's such a big city guy that he can't barely stand having to spend his precious time in this town, doing this silly report that he'd much rather not do at all, accompanied by his news crew of Rita (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot). His day's experience is detailed extensively and it may seem that it's going nowhere until Phil wakes up the next morning to Sonny and Cher's I Got You Babe on the alarm clock. From then on it's as if he was having a déjà vu moment except that he's reliving the same day all over again. At first, he brushes it off as coincidental but as the day progresses he realizes that every event during his day in Punxsutawney is repeating itself and he can foresee every single thing that's about to happen beforehand. In the following days after his initial surprise Phil feels invincible, able to do and say things in a perfected way and hoping that ""doing it well"" is good enough for him to allow him to see the ""next day"" but, regardless of what he does, he wakes up to I Got You Babe every morning, in the same room, having to co-exist with same locals and visitors that come to see the groundhog predict the weather.",

It might have been more fun if Bill had gone from being nice to become embittered and cynical, but as a ""feel-good"" romantic comedy it's not too bad. There are some good scenes where Phil (Murray) becomes disillusioned and attempts suicide, and then there are some amusing, and highly inventive, ways in which he passes the time.

A wonderful little romantic comedy that is full of quirks, fantastic and zany humor, an eventually touching romantic sub-plot and Bill Murray putting in his best performance in a comedy film (only his recent turn in Lost in Translation is on a par with his performance here), this is as close as romantic comedies come to perfection. While the plot has been done on countless science fiction and fantasy television shows, from The Twilight Zone to The X Files, Star Trek to Buffy The Vampire Slayer, the concept works frequently well and does so here, working brilliantly due to the efforts of Harold Ramis behind the camera and script, alongside Danny Rubin on screenplay duties and the magnificent central performance of Bill Murray as Phil Connors, the egotistical and heartless reporter who, in the grand traditions of Hollywood, becomes a better man due to his predicament. While it is clear early on that this is where the story is going, the journey there is one of the most entertaining and downright funny comedies to be filmed. Phil's journey takes in the the emotional ranges of bewilderment, to confidence in using the time warp to his advantage (getting laid, stealing money from a bank van, trying to move in on his producer Rita (a beautiful Andie McDowell)) to depression that leads to many suicide attempts and eventually to acceptance, where he tries to right the wrongs of the day, from being nicer to Rita and his camera man Larry, to saving lives successfully (Buster, the Groundhog keeper) to sadly the not so successful (the old man in the street).

It is not as if GROUNDHOG DAY were only a lightweight romantic comedy. It *is* exceptionally funny, the perfect vehicle for Bill Murray's sardonic wit, but like Frank Capra's work (which this film most closely resembles) there is great depth and a message here. Phil Connors' journey from cynicism and vanity to humility and redemption may be a touch whimsical, but it is also touching and finally uplifting.

Even if you commit suicide, you will wake up the same morning, intact and unharmed. Could you fall in love? What would be the point of living? You would memorize everything that will happen on that particular day. You would know what time, who would be where and for what reason. Perhaps, that is what life is - the uncertainty principle that makes us live. You wouldn't need any money for anything. Very clever film and one of Murray's best performance - highly recommended.",

Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a weatherman who along with co-workers Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell) and Larry the camera man (Chris Elliot) are sent to cover the weather report in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, United States for Groundhog day. Phil is most displeased but swallows his pride and goes through with it. After having a less than perfect February 2, he goes to sleep and wakes up on the exact same day. Over and over Phil finds himself in February 2,1993 with the exact same events occurring and he's the only one that knows about it. With this he starts to act out which includes expressing how he really feels about the entire celebration. It's a very funny movie with Murray's trademark sarcasm but it also can help you relate to some real life problems. Everyone feels like Phil sometimes. We are all forced to do things we don't really want to for work and that's exactly what we see here. I can definitely recommend Groundhog Day.",

WHAT ABOUT BOB? meets THE TWILIGHT ZONE and ends up being a priceless match.

436,4 February 2021,cordelialeite,9, Overall a Great Movie,"What a cool movie! Watched it more than once and it's unusual for me to do so.
But I have one complaint.
Phil is basically a jerk and Rita only reprimands him when he decides to order lots of food...and says something about being condemned to have depression.
Isn't the movie supposed to be about being kind and considerate? Depression is a disease and has nothing to do with being arrogant or a bad person...it's organic. Her reaction to his eating spree cause her a strong reaction. I guess it's because our society has an unhealthy relationship with food full of shame and guilt and tries to punish those who dare to eat more. Her character is portrayed as kind and sweet...which I don't think is exactly the case. Mocking, reprimanding or being angry at an adult person because of that was pretty strange. If Rita got angry at him when he insulted someone else it would make more sense.
That would be a nice idea for a second Groundhog Day, this time with Rita being in the loop. After all, everybody has something to improve.",

438,18 December 2005,Bogmeister,9, Today is Yesterday Ad Infinitum,"A fantastic premise done up with comedy and irony: when Phil (Murray) subtly hints at the beginning how repetitive his 4th time (4th year)reporting in that little town for Groundhog Day seems to be, he has no clue as to what's in store - what repetition really is. This is the amusing version of the chilling half-hour version of ""12:01"" where the poor guy repeats an hour. There was also a more mundane ""12:01"" TV movie, also with one day being repeated, which was still entertaining. But this has Murray, who besides expectedly delivering all the goods on the funny aspects of the same day premise, has to also convey some of the wistfulness and despair associated with such a dilemma. To the film's credit, the story doesn't hold back on showing the full potential of such a wild concept: Phil relives the same day for years, gaining new talents & disciplines in the process, and running through the whole gamut of emotional arcs as all that special time passes: shock, bewilderment, recklessness, debauchery, suicide (the aforementioned despair), delusions of godhood and finally a kind of serene acceptance of his strange situation - this last can be construed as 'giving in' to the cosmic joke or lesson played on him.",
439,11 July 2000,DavidPumpkins,10, Wonderful film,"Groundhog Day is proof that Hollywood is still capable of making light-hearted comedies without having to be constantly crude or offensive to some quarters.

Director Harold Ramis keeps the idea new each time as Connors tries all sorts of different activities to release himself from the nightmare.

As well as telling the rarest of all plots for movies especially for a comedy reliving the same day which really would be annoying if that happened in real life, (of which was Ramis' message.). This movie is one of the best comedy movie that I have seen in a long time thanks to both Bill Murray's and Harold Ramis' comedic genius as well as a movie that made me have more appreciation for comedy movies even though I like more serious types of movies.

Andie MacDowell is delightful as love interest Rita and her chemistry with Murray is excellent. This is one of the funniest films I have ever seen and I always laugh no matter how many times I have seen the film before. The writing is just terrific and director Harold Ramis does a fantastic job at giving the film a realistic feel despite its silly and unrealistic plot.

It is funny that an actress I don't rate very highly plays a major role in 2 of my favourite films (the other being 3W&1F; I also liked green card, but the star of that for me was the delightful conservatory). But imho the greatness of the film hinges on the path Murray's character takes when granted apparent immortality, with desperation followed by exploitation followed by despair and suicide attempts, until he finally gets it!
In the process, I don't know how many times he gets his face slapped by the object of his desires... affection... and eventually genuine love, but enough to give him a permanent disability if not for the daily reset button.

Would you pick the day you were in Punxsatawney, Pa. to watch a furry animal pop out of a hole to see if winter comes in 6 weeks, or in less time? I've been to Punxsatawney, and I wouldn't want to relive that day over and over again either. Unfortunately for Bill Murray's TV weatherman character Phil Conners, that's exactly what happens in this odd little comedy directed by Harold Ramis. What begins as a comedy about ""big time"" TV people from Pittsburgh covering the February 2nd rite of passage in Western Pennsylvania. The story ultimately revolves around how Conners is an unhappy man and somehow, he's stuck in a time warp that he can't get out of. He tries being nice, he tries be a bastard, he tries driving out of town, he tries stealing the groundhog, he even tries dying. Nothing gets him out of February 2 in Punxsatawney. Among the many groundhog days, he discovers the world, the people around him. He's saddened by the death of a man he passed every morning. He meets a person he knew in high school, and his attitude towards him changes over time, and he realizes the happiness he needs to fulfill his life is right there in front of him. Sure it's cheesy, sure it's predictable, but there's enough Bill Murray humor early in the film and Bill Murray charm in the end of the movie to hold it together. There are some cute scenes where ""one day"" he asks a random woman in a coffee shop what her favorite something is, and the ""next day"" uses that information to score a date. There are little scenes like that through the film that rely on Murray, and the audience, buying into the premise of the film. Andie MacDowell plays Conners' TV producer and Chris Elliott plays his camera man, each has the thankless job of playing characters who have no idea that Conners is reliving each day over and over again. One thing that bothered me was the movie was not shot in Punxsatawney, rather some town in Illinois, and that bothered me a bit, but most people wouldn't know unless they were told.

The fact stands that Bill Murray is one of the greatest comedic geniuses of his time. I cannot explain the grace and charm Bill releases into the texture of the movie. It is hard to fathom another actor who audiences have the patience to sit through and watch a man, over and over again, fail miserably at winning the girl's heart. Phil's transformation from a demon to a saint is well accommodated by Bill Murray's physical versatility. He can portray a ""glass half empty"" character and still be left with grace, or he can bring out a believable kindhearted soul that audiences follow with admiration. It is my opinion that Harold Ramis did not directly create the character, but let Bill Murray manifesting himself into the character of Phil Conners. I know very little about Harold Ramis' creative techniques, but I do know that he is a great man for making the executive decision to place his old friend Bill Murray into this role. I am speaking out of my rear end and this is just my opinion, so if there is any discrepancies do not write a counter comment please.

511,29 April 2023,atleverton,9, A Movie that Suffers from its own Influence,"I recently rewatched this movie, and it was an interesting experience because there are films that I can rewatch again and again and never get tired of them, but this is not one of them. It's kind of surprising because I remember watching this movie and having my mind blown by the great premise of it. The movie is 30 years old, so I don't think I'm spoiling anything when I say that it's about a man who gets trapped in a time loop and eventually escapes the time Loop. The man is played, I don't want to say wonderfully, by Bill Murray, but aptly by Bill Murray. He acts like Bill Murray. Bill Murray never acts. Maybe he acts in a few movies, but this is not a movie where he's really acting. Here he's just playing the typical deadpan Bill Murray character. There are some great comedic moments where he's trying to commit suicide, and he takes the ground hog with him, and he's just talking like a wild man, so there are parts that are great. I have kind of a real knit picky criticism, Andy McDowell plays the love interest in this film, and she's presented at one point with this really soft out of focus lighting and when streaming it on Netflix you can really tell, like the quality of our modern streaming services shows what they're doing and when you're watching the film you might notice that subconsciously in the theater at the time, but it wouldn't be so obvious but now it was so glaringly obvious what they were doing like oh look she's so beautiful. She's not unattractive, but does she really need that much help to look good? It wasn't about making her look good, it was like making her look angelic right, and I did not like that at all. I thought it was very manipulative, but I think that's probably not the filmmaker's fault, it's more the fault of technology catching up to tricks like that. The other problem that the film faces is not connected to the film itself. It's for lack of a better term, The Matrix effect, so the Matrix is a very influential move to be with a mind-blowing, really high sci-fi, concept. So influential in fact that you can say I think we're living in The Matrix and people immediately know what you're talking about, and Ground hog Day is the same way. If I say I feel like I'm living in Ground hog Day you don't think about the holiday on February 2nd you think about the movie. This is the epitome of a Time Loop movie, perhaps there were time Loop movies before and certainly there have been time Loop movies after, but this is the one that everybody thinks about. This is the one that's so influential and because it's so influential when you actually watch it you're kind of underwhelmed, and it's strange because there's nothing bad about the movie in fact it's really good that's why it's so influential. It's just that there have been so many reiterations and so many movies playing upon this idea after, and it's such a part of culture now, that it feels a little bit underwhelming. For example, I think my favorite time loop movie would have to be Happy Death Day, so it takes the idea of being stuck in a time loop and actually gives stakes to it so the problem and kind of the philosophical dilemma of Ground hog Day is that there are no stakes. He can't live, he can't die, so what are you doing in that situation where you are just stuck in one place? I think it's definitely worth a watch if you haven't seen it before, but again if you're a certain age you probably have watched this, and it might not bear rewatching. I did introduce it to my children recently, and I wouldn't say that they enjoyed it because that would be a little bit of a stretch, but they did watch it and afterwards separately both of them asked me very deep questions about time and what they would do in that situation, so it clearly still has an impact on people is still influential.",

534,29 July 2007,rafaelq3,10, A film that can change the way you see the life,"A minor thing for me is that the film is refinedly funny and that it develops at a continuous speed that you cannot be boring at any moment. An exception of that may be the first ten minutes, because the main character, Phil Connors, achieves to transmit his personal view of life, as a bitter routine. We, as he himself, don't have the minimum interest in the Groundhog day (sorry for those that love groundhogs). Since the moment that Phil Connors is trapped in time, the film is no more senseless. The thing that makes this film so valuable, and not recognized enough, is that it reflects our own lives. The first time that Phil re-lives the Groundhog day, one can think ¿what's happened? ¿which extrasensorial power has made him to be trapped in that date? Oh, well, it's just fantasy. But when you contemplate all the story, you realize that the reason is in Phil himself, the same as the reason why we live our lives as a boring routine is in ourselves. The first things that Phil Connors makes when he realizes that he cannot scape from that endless repetition, are funny, but nonsense. The happiness that we find in those things that we make to break the routine of our lives are funny too for a short time, but the entertainment ends very quickly, because our lives have no sense. The character of Phil Connors searches different ways of finding how to fill his eternal life, but the only one thing that can give sense to his life is LOVE. Not just the relation with that wonderful (until that moment undiscovered) woman, who is working with him, but love to mankind, to any person that needs us. Love means interest in their lives, in their worries. The way he finally breaks the spell can only be understood by those who have penetrate in the meaning of the film.",

539,17 May 2000,stang4,10, An Unsung Masterpiece,"This movie is far more than a good comedy.  It's an analogy to life. Phil's curse is a repetitious day that starts over the same every morning at 6:00 AM - regardless of his actions the ""day before"".  He alone remembers that it has already occurred.  At first he is clever -- using the situation for personal gain.  He finds out facts about pretty girls on day one, then uses these facts to endear himself to them on day 2.  He robs the armored car truck during the few seconds he knows it is going to be unguarded.  The novelty pales.  Unsatisfied, he becomes more desperate and apathetic. Finally, he realizes that the only way to find true satisfaction is to improve himself, help others, and try to do the world some good instead of trying to figure out what he can get from it.  When he finally lives a day to perfection, the spell breaks and his life falls into place.  It's inspiring, it's hilarious, and it's so intriguing you won't want it to end. You'll want to see this movie every couple of years just so you can remember what life is about.",

544,16 June 2015,monkeyboyhagan,10, An outstanding comedy-fantasy film,"Groundhog Day is an outstanding comedy-fantasy film about an egotistical TV weatherman named Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, who resents being forced by his Pittsburgh news producer to head to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania and cover the reveal of whether the groundhog will see his shadow on Groundhog's Day. Thinking he's a god amongst women, he assumes his travel producer Rita, played by Andie MacDowell, lusts after him and he can't help but take pot shots at his cameraman Larry, played by Chris Elliott. Once Phil has completed his day and is trapped overnight in Punxsutawney due to a blizzard closing down the highway back to Pittsburgh, he ends up in a time loop that forces him to repeat the same day over and over. He seems to be the only person who remembers already going through that day previous and even when he gets so desperate as to kill himself, he continually wakes up at 6AM on Groundhog Day back in his bed and breakfast room.",
545,5 July 2003,mtiller12,8, The best 90's comedy,"Groundhog Day is the best comedy of the 90's and I feel was overlooked at the Oscars in a way. The story is that of Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who has arrived in a small town to cover the Groundhog festival with his producer Rita (Andie McDowell) and camera man Larry (Chris Elliot). But when he must stay in the town for the night, he wakes up at in the previous day and it does so, again and again. This movie has the ultimate gag of all time with the concept of living a day for the rest of your life, it is used with great effect and Harold Ramis the director sets up very neat scenarios and does a time warp of the situations he is in but in different days. Bill Murray is in his prime here and Phil Connors is one of his best characters and his portrayl deserved perhaps a nomination, if Kline got one for A Fish Called Wanda then Murray should have recieved one. The sarcasm of Phil is great and the first cover of the festival is some of the most funny sarcasm I have ever seen. It is a shame that Murray doesn't sometimes write his characters dialogue, because he can handle the use  of sarcasm to the best comedic possibilities. There is one scene in the movie which he improvised, Ned comes up to him and instead of being a wise ass he hugs him, Ned is shaken and while hugging, Murray comes up with... ""I don't know where you're heading, but, can you call in work sick."" Ned obliges politley and runs away, Murray is right on par here in some of his best work. McDowell and Elliot are good too providing solid support but the movie truly belongs to Murray. The two category's this should have been nominated for at the Academy was Best Screenplay and Best Actor, overlooked without a doubt. This film is a very intelligent film, it has such spiritual foundations that it is feel good and also you come away with something new to your life. If you want an intelligent, romantic, fun, hilarious movie, with the best Bill Murray sarcasm, than watch Groundhog Day. When you watch you will want to watch it again, and again, and again...",

Reminds you that we keep repeating our days without making change. Until we DECIDE to change. One day, the next day will come. Excellent Film. This film is a film that will resonate with anyone who has the patience to understand how much their own lives parallel the story line. We can't help but relate to the ups and downs and frustrations of being stuck.

547,13 September 2001,pro_crustes,8," Funny, full of heart, but lacks the ending you need.","The other comments on this film are, collectively, pretty accurate, I think. Murray plays the role of the witty cynic, who lives the same boring day repeatedly, with charm and a credible mix of belief and disbelief.  He was the perfect choice for a part that was probably harder to play than he makes it look.  The writing is as good as the acting (almost; see below), moving quickly past the phase where Murray's character comes to terms with what's happening to him (a smart move, since the viewer already knows, and would be bored if it took long on the screen), and on to exploring the various things we might all think of eventually, if caught in the same sort of Twilight-Zonish phenomenon.  The results of the ""hero's"" efforts to cope with his problem are satisfying, as is his personal evolution, brought on by the experience of trying.  Only the end, which satisfies the heart, but not the brain, fails to equal the rest of the movie.  You never really learn why or how this extraordinary occurrence came to be.  The film is a fable, or fairy-tale, yet its events are so logically presented, and Murray's ways of dealing with and, finally, gaining by them so grounded in reason that the absence of any explanation leaves a hole in the story and, ultimately, your experience in seeing the film.  This would be a four-star movie, if only they'd filled that gap.",

There're so many nuances, and moments that get found and that are anticipated that you laugh the moment before it happens. I marvel at the timing and movement as you are drawn through the growth and changes faced by this unwilling human ( Phil Conners)as he faces life head on.

Not only is he extremely funny, but its obvious that he goes to great lengths in order to develop his character of Phil Conners (kudos as well to the director for this development). I liked this movie mostly because of the way Murray reacts in different ways to the same events occurring over and over again. Each reaction is always new, always fresh and always entertaining. Rounding out the supporting cast, Andie MacDowell is okay as Murray's love interest, and Chris Elliot has some funny moments in the film as well.",

He discovers what it is just as the audience does, as he goes from being concerned about the situation, to exploiting the situation, to wanting to leave the situation through any means necessary, to accepting the situation, to acknowledging his situation is more than just his own situation and that he's living this day over and over again just as everyone else is, but only he can remember it.

I just could not focus on this whole film the first time because of the tears in my eyes. Bill Murray already was a great name to add to the cast. He has been a top A-list actor in several comedies and dramas up to the point of this flick. His deadpan approach to his character just brought a realistic scenario to the out-of-this-world story line. The cast selected balanced out his nonchalant personae just right. If I could give it 100 stars out of 10 I would. Not only will it be tough to beat this films comedy style, but it will be tough to cast someone as brilliant as Bill. Simply my favorite film ever.",

On one of Phil Conners least favorite days of the year, February 2, he reports the weather just like he does every other day. But somehow he makes it through the day with his sarcastic comments and bad-mannered nature, waiting for tomorrow; hoping it is better. But tomorrow never comes. This movie brings so much more to the table than one would expect. Bill Murray is perfect in the lead role who learns important lessons throughout. The fact this it is labeled as a comedy is one that I think is wrong; that is merely one of the qualities that it offers. It is hilarious, heart breaking, touching, and inspiring, all of which I would hope to see in a film.

As Bill Murray lives the same day over and over, we learn that given eternity, the only factor that will change is the person experiencing eternity. We see this through him learning French, the piano, ice sculpting. But I think more intriguing than that is the way Phil learns about the people in the small town.

Bill Murray gives his own flavor to comedy, deals with sarcasm to perfection. The biggest plus of the movie is the lesson(s) it teaches you about life, like you never stop trying especially when you are in love, you try to hit the perfection level and luckily this guy had several chances too, to do so. Another way to look at it is, also when you spend a lot of time with certain people, over a period you do tend to develop good feelings towards them. It is symbolic in sense that life can be so much better if you try to be good to people around, it is a petty cost you pay to be away from frustration or its worst form, depression. On the technical side, the repetitive sequences in the movie could have been lessened by combining some of them because towards the end they do become a little irritating. But the curiosity to see how it will end & Bill Murray's face expressions keep you up. It is a well casted movie, gets into motion right away. The scenes have been ordered sensibly, keeping in line with Bill Murray's state of mind (in the movie ;)). All in all good stuff with good after taste too.",

It is about time, transformation, and the weather.

Having the main character Phil, played by Bill Murray, be a easily unlikable character allows for some great storytelling and character development that you don't get a chance to have in other films. By giving Phil unlimited days to grow and change, while everyone around him will always remains unchanged, only highlights Phil's journey to become a better man that much more. In that journey there is a lot of comedy, with terrific directing from Harold Ramis, and one of Murray's best performances.

He is not just delivering some funny script lines, he's performing with his full body. It's funny when he looks, when he reacts, when he wakes up (every morning). That's something which is missing from comedies nowadays. And Groundhog Day doesn't need to explain everything to us. Murrays weatherman ist reliving the same day again and again. Why? We don't know.

What an intriguing concept this is, and how cleverly it is told. The repeating day formula could easily become hammy, unfunny and tedious, but it is constructed beautifully. The key to this is the absence of long-term temporal reference - we are stuck in the same day as Phil, but without knowing how much we haven't seen. We see relationships at key points, we see plans at their inspiration and at their culmination, and the way we are constantly made to play catchup and fill in the blanks contributes to a sense that we are sharing and matching Phil's relationship with his predicament. A simple premise continually manages to find new avenues to surprise us, without ever feeling as though its movements are purposeless. There is a fantastic sense of direction here, and it makes the film far deeper than initially expected. This film plays with you gently, and charms you into engaging in what appears a mundane setup.

The subject, the hidden message (not hidden very deeply), if you will, is about what it feels like to be stuck -- to be unable to transcend your own problems and limitations. Sounds like a film about learning to be mature, about being willing to listen to others, learning to care about them. These are spiritual matters. But this film has Bill Murray, right? And what a fine job he does. No one would go to see a straight-out religious film about learning to be kind, learning to listen, about what really makes living worthwhile -- well, OK, a few people might. But make it into a lively comedy (and why not?  Dante's great poem was ""The Divine Comedy,"" after all) -- and you get something like this. ""Groundhog Day"" should be classed alongside, or even above, to my mind, ""It's a Wonderful Life."" Every parent should take their kid to see this film -- if you have a larger family, take each one of your kids individually, make the occasion special thereby. Then talk about it together, ask your child they liked about it. This is non-denominational spirituality; Gandhi said ""God has no religion."" This comedy has that kind of Gandhian quality, in the best sense. This film can be especially wonderful and powerful for young men, even teenagers -- because it seems like Murray's character is happy exploring all kinds of mischief, delighted about getting away with everything -- almost. Then he gets kind of angry. Personally, growing up, especially during my teen years, I thought being angry was what being a man was all about.  Not that I always ""thought"" about it; but a deeper, subconscious feeling  lived inside me, the sense that anger would protect me, or make me strong. Hey, don't get me wrong -- seeing this film didn't get me over that. But getting over it, or at leasting understanding where I'd been, etc., was a huge step for me. ""Groundhog Day"" made me receptive to more positive thinking, because it didn't preach. Oh, did I mention I couldn't stop laughing in the theater and worried about embarrassing other people around me because I was laughing so much? Most of them were laughing, too. A great film; I really believe that. People love Charlie Chaplin's ""Little Tramp"" -- the same kind of sentiment applies for me to this film. I buy very few films, since renting nowadays, and cable and satellite dishes all work so well. But ""Groundhog Day"" is one of about ten videos I've bought in the last twenty years. And it's the most watched and rewatched of the lot.",

You only have one shot at life but the main character seems to have a mini-life (the same day) repeating itself. He tries to enjoy himself but gets jaded when he realises that nothing matters the next day as nobody remembers anything. The character is lucky in the sense that he can, through trial and error, realise what's important in life. He eventually realises how he can be truly satisfied.

Equally appeals to all ages and both genders. My wife and teenage son were both enchanted by the twists of the plot and hilarious situations. Bill Murray is so convincing and charming that this one movie made him a comedy superstar. But, of course, the quality of the screenplay and acting will ensure that this movie will remain at the top of the charts for decades to come. The idea of the plot is not original, but nobody even remembers other films exploiting it, while this movie quickly became a classic. It is full of a good humor and romance, and it is fun to watch again and again (I don't know about you, but I can name may be only a couple of other movies that I would like to see multiple times).",

After much consideration, I have come to the conclusion that Groundhog Day is a perfect movie. Also, I have to acknowledge that statement's clear contradiction that while Groundhog Day is a perfect movie, it does not necessarily mean that it is the greatest movie of all-time. You see, a film can be perfect by soundly succeeding in delivering its message, or by finding its mark in what it is trying to convey/accomplish. Other films I believe to be perfect are: The Natural (1984), It's A Wonderful Life (1946), High Noon (1952), and D.O.A. (1950). Those films may not be the best movies of all-time, but they are perfect cinematic works. ",

And all the other people don't know, they just living the day. And Phil falls in love with Rita (Andie MacDowell), and he has to win her love everyday over and over again.

Every time they show it on TV, I somehow end up glued to the screen. No winter is perfect without at least one viewing of this lovely winter tale. Although it's not about Christmas, it has this very X-masy feel about it. The way Bill Murray plays the cynic is great, and it is very moving (and funny at the same time) to watch how he gradually gets purified by his ordeal, until by the end he is ethically almost ""superhuman"". Also it is so funny because you know what's going to come next and you can't wait to see how he tries out different ways of dealing with the same situation. Although there never is an explanation about why and how the repetition of this one day comes about, it is obvious from the way the movie ends that God (or someone else up there who wants us to become good people) takes a hand in this. Of course there are a few things in the plot that can't stand up under scrutiny (people seem to remember things they shouldn't) - but that is not the point.",

This is the last thing a big star weatherman like Connors wants to be doing, but in spite of his best efforts to get it over before the incoming storm front, things don't really work out as planned: the big-city sophisticate is forced to live out the same day again and again in a place he really doesn't want to be, Small Town USA, full of hicks from the sticks.",

But he takes it to a higher level in Harold Ramis' ""Groundhog Day,"" owing to a fantastic script which perfectly executes the story's clever premise, and makes perfect use of the Lovable Jerk persona as a springboard for a real character-driven story.  I can't imagine the movie being done with another actor in the lead role, and that is, I think, one of the more remarkable things about it.

Most people, if they got a chance to live a day over and over would do the same things as Phil Connors, trying to make things better for themselves.

In two great movies, Murray rises above that infantile ""finger up yer nose"" stuff and really turns in a complex and brilliant performance, one such is ""What about Bob?"" with Richard Dreyfuss and the other is ""Groundhog Day."" Unlike such lame, childish crap as ""Caddy Shack,"" this is simply one of the funniest movies ever made and proves that, like Jim Carrey, when Bill plays it ""straight,"" he can really shine.

In the movie it seems that Phil Connors (played by Bill Murray) is the only person who relives the 2nd of February over and over again but of course all the people living in small Punxsutawney relive this day. Everything they experience is forgotten the moment that they wake up again when it is the 2nd of February again and also their physical condition is the same as on their wake-up on the day before. Notice that Phil can save lives but if he doesn't interfere the deceased will also wake-up next morning. It is even possible (although we don't see this) that a baby is born over and over again because in the morning he is back in his or hers mama's belly. Or that Phil impregnates a woman (he makes love to at least one woman in the film) and that the fertilized ovum is unimpregnated again when the woman wakes up.,

I mean, there is no real indication of the duration of the characters stay in limbo - has he lived the same day over for a few days, weeks, months, years or centuries? This is just one question of many, in a film lacking (though not really needing) any answers. Then of course there is the casting of Murray. This, along with his Ghostbusters outings, seems to be the perfect role for the guy. He revels in the sarcastic humorist role, but is totally believable when he softens to the effortless charms of McDowell (who also fits her character like a glove). Great film.",

664,10 April 2006,j-bone-2,7," A fantastic concept, brilliantly cast and wonderfully directed.","A film that was perhaps underrated by critics upon its release, Groundhog Day is a classic example of a film that has spread through word of mouth. Bill Murray is perfectly cast as the grumpy weatherman whose egotistical character would rather be in the studio than out on location. Andie MacDowell is equally great as the kind and caring 'environmentally friendly' love interest that contrasts diligently with Murrays bullish persona. The concept is something that almost every person has toyed with at one point or another - what would happen if tomorrow I woke up and re-lived today. With this in mind Groundhog Day manages to investigate this notion with humour, wit and a sense of class that makes it stand out as a great movie that will, I'm sure, endure the very thing it explores - time.",

When the situation becomes a chance the film moves from straight comedy to romantic comedy without a problem. A totally round story, an sensible direction and a nice casting with a fabulous Bill Murray playing his character with a touch of cinisism that never lets the film become corny, and one of the best screenplay that I've ever seen, are the ingredients that makes this film a jewel.

I think this one the best comedy of the 90s not only for the Brilliant performance of Bill Murray (absolutely perfect in this role)but in particular for the deeper meaning of the story. In fact Phil's life is a disaster he's selfish,presumptuous, cinic and only when he changes his nature,stopping to use this absurd situation for his goals ,things will be better for him and the 2nd of February finally will be the 3rd!.So knowing perfectly the things of the day he's forced to live ever he starts helping people : save a child who's falling form a tree,save a man hit by an heart attack and so on in this way he also conquest the woman of his dreams (Andy McDowell).So this film is  a metaphor.Each of us after all live always the same day (wake at the same time,make the same job,see the same people)without realizing it,maybe we should make like Phil and try to change ,even just a bit,to be better person and to feel better ,is it so difficult ?..",

693,26 September 2002,Tenenbaum21,10, Bill Murray's best film. HILARIOUS!,"Groundhog Day is of the funniest movies ever released or even remotely thought up of by cinema makers. Bill Murray is at his greatest with outstanding lines of sarcastic replies and obvious insults to whoever his victim may be. Harold Ramis wrote and directed this film, as he has so many other fine pieces of film. Ramis also had a small role as a doctor in this film. Andie McDowel had a key role in this movie as the woman Murray's character is in love with. I usually find McDowel's accent and her acting quite annoying, but this is one of her better films. Saturday Night Live's Chris Elliott had a supporting role as ""Larry"" and he played his part very well. I believed he was better than Andie McDowel in some certain points. There is nothing that is not funny about this very entertaining film. Groundhog Day is about one man's experience through a day of hell that will never end- Groundhog Day. He tries to shoot,electrocute,stap,get run over by a Semi truck, but he always wakes up on one day- Groundhog Day. The ""Academy"" failed to award an outstanding film the awards it deserved. Groundhog Day is a film that all should experience. Bill Murray will definitely make you laugh. I would highly recommend that you rent this film because it is a highly wonderful piece of entertainment that all will enjoy!",

He is not happy about covering the story because this is his third year. After doing the story and awaking the following day he discovers that ""Groundhog Day"" is happening all over again, and again, and again. He at first goes crazy about it and then he starts to realize that he can use this to his advantage. He then realizes that he will spend the rest of his life in the same place, with the same people doing the same thing. Phil Conners is the selfish weatherman for the local station WPBH-TV, Pittsburgh. He has no respect for hi co-workers as well as the viewers. He absolutely hates ""Groundhog Day"" which is held in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Phil is to cover this event with Rita and Larry who are the new producer and cameraman. After doing the broadcast Phil wants to leave Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania immediately. However, a snowstorm leaves them spending another night. When Phil wakes the next morning he believes he is experiencing déjà vu because he is reliving Groundhog Day all over again. He keeps reliving this day after day after day. He realizes that this may be his fate but also figures out that his actions have no consequences, but the knowledge can help him gain information about what he wants especially when it comes to Rita. Phil is given ample opportunity time after time to get the day ""right"". Just like in the movie ""50 First Dates"" where a veterinarian has to keep winning the heart of a girl he fell in love with because she has a short term memory. With every new day he has to start over and make sure he gets it right. In this movie the motif is relevant to this movie because it is where they keep repeating the same day. This is important because it helps the view to understand the theme of the movie. The lighting in this movie was high-key lighting which helped create an effective image for the viewers. All Phil Conners had to do was get the day ""right"". Until this happened he would keep reliving the same day. This helped him gain knowledge on some stuff he needed but it also helped him realize that he would spend the rest of his life with the same people doing the same thing every day. He was given plenty of days to get it right.",

The only thing different was the backgrounds of the power-point presentations and the % differences in growth quarter after quarter. About 3 meetings into this trend, I dubbed our meetings groundhog day. Did they change? Sadly no, they just started saying, ""we want to avoid another 'groundhog day' in every presentation.

He hates his job and pretty much everything about his life and he enjoys being a jerk to anyone and everyone he can. He ends up spending day after day after day in the same exact location. Each morning he wakes up and it is the same day. There have been many papers/ stories written on the idea of immortality and this story is one of the best.

I'm normally not a fan of the ""smarmy"" school of humor that's so popular with the original bunch of Saturday Night Live alums: Chase, Belushi, Murray, et al. The ""humor"" in their characters all too often consists of them being ""cooler"" than the rest of the world, and laughing at those less ""cool"". And if you want to be ""cool"", too, you'd better laugh with them. It's humor as high school clique.

It has Bill Murray in a performance that boasts toward both the devilish and the heartfelt and a safely entertaining amount of jokes and gags.

However, the important thing is how are we going to live today, the one just like every other day? The film used the groundhog festival wisely as a moral.

I never get bored with it because the setting of the movie is so convincingly laid out that you feel like you are able to spy on the characters as the story unfolds. This is a rare quality that I have only seen with a few other movies: ""Fargo"", ""Cape Fear"" (the one with DeNiro), and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" It is similar to how you would feel if you were able to see a film of close friends in an entertaining story. You feel as you know the people and the place. Fantastic! Bill Murray is Outstanding!! Chris Elliot is a funny supporting character. Andie McDowell, however, leaves question as to Bill Murray's Characters taste in women (a little too angelic for my taste - doesn't fit at all with his character). The townspeople have a strong role in this picture. They are the Currier and Ives simple-folk backdrop to Bill Murray's city-slicker character.",

I have watched it 100% straight and 100% stoned on very good weed, my preference is to watch it quite stoned on primo bud. I have finally watched it so much that now I'm looking for real scientific miscalculations and the best that I can ascertain
is that there is one major inconsistency that just never gets thought about. Here it is: Phil is 100% aware that he is caught in a time-warp, reliving the same day continuously day after day. The inconsistency is that so does the rest of the town, except they are totally unaware that they too are living the same day over and over. Only Phil is aware that he has an ability to constantly change and improve. Everyone else experiences change,
but they are blissfully unaware that they too are reliving ""Groundhog Day"" over and over as well.",

720,6 March 2018,kristinkling,1, Sexist Hollywood garbage,"Groundhog Day is a movie about a creepy shtbag who relives the same day over and over and uses that inconvenience to gaslight and manipulate women into thinking that he's not a creepy shtbag. In some alternative universe (1993?) this is apparently supposed to be funny or romantic. Imagine how many women viewers have been fed this ""your love can change the a**hole""-narrative over the decades. As per usual in this genre, all the women are also portrayed as sex-objects who are either airheads or without much of a personality. Not to mention the illogical time-concept where he bumps into the exact same people in the same place despite having skipped events, unlike the day before. The protagonist clearly isn't the sharpest knife in the box, considering that he never even made a serious effort to leave town and go to bed somewhere else to see if the time loop is bound to the hotel/town where he's visiting. Apart from the rampant sexism and lack of logic, you can also predict the ending about half way into the movie. This movie is hardly alone in pushing the very destructive ""it's just part of the romance when a guy is being a dipsht to you""-agenda, and that is exactly what is so terrifying. The frequency with which this agenda is pushed in this genre is partly why so many people can watch a movie like this without recognizing the problem of that this sexist dramaturgy both mirrors and contributes to creating sexist values in our society. Pure Hollywood garbage that should never have made in to the big screen.",

Bill Murray is at his best, witty, endearing, and likeable as a man wrestling with the ultimate monotony of life.

An excellent question, and Murray's characters conclusion is warmly provocative.",

It was an idea that has been done many times. This movie is one of the original movies with this idea and I think it was executed as well as it could have been. I liked seeing how his outlook on life changed every time he had to repeat the same day over and over again. It was obvious the first couple of days were going to be him trying to figure out what was happening. my favorite parts in this movie were when he had finally realized he could do anything he wanted with no consequences. He punched an annoying friend in the face, he said anything he wanted and he even killed himself....many times. Even though he didn't know exactly why this was happening he used it to his advantage. he used it to pick up girls and every time he would mess up on a date he could easily start the whole date over again because he knew the day would start completely over and nothing he did stuck. He would learn new information about people to impress them and pretend he was someone he was not. He was definitely smart but he did these things because he was bored and wanted to see how much he could get away with. I also enjoyed how relatable it was. I imagine ay person would go through the exact process that Bill Murray went through in this movie. The end was obvious but I still enjoyed watching him grow as a person. He began to do good deeds which he never would have done in the beginning of the movie. He becomes a genuinely good person and that is how he gets out of repeating the exact same day over and over again. Groundhog Day was funny when it wanted to be but serious when it needed to be. It was overall a very well thought out movie and I enjoyed it very much.",

Its hard to make a movie that repeats the same day funny and Bill Murray made it funny his performance was very good. My favorite part is the beginning when he realizes that he is repeating the days he does everything that people would think of doing such as getting chased by the cops or robbing a bank. Also in the movie you see Murray's attitude change as he relives the days and he starts to feel sympathy for himself and others. It also made like the movie a little more and I would watch this movie again.,

With that said, this film is a classic tale of redemption ala A Christmas Carol. Instead of ghosts showing him the errors of his ways and warning of the consequences, it is that he must live his in an unchanging way until it dawns on him that life is not what he made of it but what he should make of it. The most poignant part of the film is where he tries to save the life of the old man and realizes that there are things in life which are already determined and are immutable, but most of life is changeable. Listening to the soundtrack evokes powerful responses and imagery. I dare you to see this film and listen to the soundtrack and not be moved. This is what makes this film so great.

Not only has Harold Ramis used wit and intelligence in a hilarious comedy as he did in Ghostbusters, but he has delivered a feel-good masterpiece that makes one think twice about the direction of their lives.  This film had much more than a story to tell, (although it's appearance of The Twilight Zone gone comedy is breathtaking) but it actually enlightens the audience to a whole new world of possibilities within their lives. Bill Murray is at his best as a cruel and cynnical but witty Pittsburg weatherman named Phil Connors.  After going to the small but lively town of Punxatawney to report the groundhog festival, he learns that he is doomed to repeat the same day over and over again.... until he gets it right. The antics Phil goes about are wonderfully imaginative, sparking the question in everyone's mind: What would you do if there were no tomorrow?

You can watch this film many times before it is the case that you don't pick up on some new nuance of gesture from Murray or some other subtle perfection. One of my favourite lines: ""You wanna know about the weather? You're asking the wrong Phil. I'll tell you about the weather. It's cold and it's grey and it's gonna last the rest of your life."" His descent into despair allows for some of the best comedy of the film...Nowhere can a great comedian shine better than as a character who has hit rock bottom and has nothing left to lose",
753,19 January 2002,charlesquinn_1999,9, A Bill Murray Classic,"Hilarious!  A classic for the Bill Murray fan.  Andie MacDowell is subtly sexy as always.  What I appreciate most about this unique film is that it realistically addresses a question all of us have asked ourselves before...""What would I have done differently if I could do it again?""  (I wouldn't have raised my voice at my senior prom date--a stunningly attractive girl--because she didn't wait until I opened the car door for her.  We didn't know each other well to begin with and it ruined the evening.) We see through Murray the transformation of a man from self-centered to sharing, cold-hearted to caring, as he re-lives the same day over and over and over again.  My favorite scene involved a dinner date with Murray's film love interest, Andie MacDowell.  As they dine across from one another, discussing their interests, hopes and dreams, Andie highlights her love for European classics (or something similarly mundane).  Murray's character, in classic alpha-male form, bursts out laughing like ""that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life.""  Andie is visibly hurt.  Cut to the next scene--same dinner, same conversation.  Andie--""I love European classics.""  Murray - meditating on the profundity of Andie's statement, quotes a poem from that period...in French!  Andie--""I didn't know you had such an appreciation for those works.""  Murray--""Oui""  (French for yes) Score 10 pts. for Murray in Andie's book.  For one day, we get to see someone live a regret-free, no holds barred, do want you want to, anything goes day.  Yesterday's mistake becomes today's victory!  I (obviously) haven't seen the film in awhile, but I recall little profanity and no nudity or violence, making it (somewhat) kid appropriate.  One of my favorite comedies of all time.",

763,13 October 2018,h-86219,6, Will your 3rd Feb. come? 60816 1101 Zhou Yuhan,"Last Monday,I watched a film called Groundhog Day,which leaves me a deep impression on the fantasy and romance containing in it. Although released in 1993,the film has an incredible insight into life in 21st century. The hero Phil is played by Bill Murray,while Andie,the actress,characterizes Rita's features vividly. Directed by Harold Ramis,the film has won 6 wins and 17 nominations. You won't be regret to enjoy it.
 The story begins normally,a weatherman with his team is going to cover the annual Groundhog festivities in Punxsutawney. However,the arrogance inside Phil and the ordinary village become contradictory,which drives the next actions. Ironically,Phil finds out that he awakes at 6 every morning,and then,suffer from the same day, 2nd Feb. He cannot leave the town,nor commit a suicide. Sometimes tricks are played,to date a woman or make fun of others. Gradually,he fills himself by learning skills and helping people in need. Subtle changes eventually make him a better person. At last,Rita falls in love with this kind man and 3rd Feb. comes.
 Murray portray the role Phil in a particular way. When he realizes that he have to undertake the same day again,first he shows unbelievable,then there is curiosity and boredom. All of these,psychological actions are presented by Murray's gestures and facial expressions. Nevertheless,Rita's part is also attractive since she is the main point of Phil's life. The shift attitude of the supporting roles matters undoubtedly. In all,their acting performance is successful through the gradations.
 The film techniques are rather simple but meaningful. One repeated and classical shot is the 6:00 a.m. clock. The clock turns 6 and music begins,then we all know the same day misery happens again. More interestingly,because the film shoots repeated scene,every decorations and locations of actors must be accurately right. I suppose that was a tolerant.
 The first theme is apparent,which teaches us to treasure and to be a good person.And the second one is my own assumption. In contemporary life,many people live exhaustedly and numbly,have nothing changed,thus no passion for life and their 3rd Feb. never comes. They just live one day for a thousand times,instead of living a thousand days for themselves. This is quite alarming,and makes us rethink.
 Many successes are mentioned,though the repeated plots seem to be a little boring. In conclusion,this is a movie that suits lovers and friends at weekend. I will give six stars out of ten.

764,22 February 2023,moin1139,10, A perfect logical end,"I was never a fan of bill Murray or Andie McDowell; but for this movie, I didn't have to be one. The story was something new. Almost flawless. The turn of events were back to back surprise. The swings in the mood of the story was touching and realistic. Shock, excitement, fun, opportunity, upper hand, and then at the end, frustration...
Acting was outstanding by all the involved ones. Some cliches were present, but i guess 1996 was welcoming those type of jokes. Music was cherry on the cake.

775,12 February 1999,philenor,10, this 'what-if' comedy surpasses all expectations,"This surpasses all the expectations one would have for the kind of movie that it appears to be: a whimsical comedy based on a 'what if?' premise, in which some fundamental assumption about the universe around us is altered, to amusing effect.  Films in this particular sub-genre (does it have a name? I think of these as 'Twilight Zone' comedies) have a certain appeal for me, but most supply a few laughs, not much more.  I usually come away from them with a sense of an opportunity missed, due to sloppy execution or lack of imagination.  The screenplay of ""Groundhog Day"" is outstanding, in that its creators evidently gave much thought to answering the question: if a person found himself inescapably, eternally repeating the same day in his life, just what _would_ he do?  The execution of this 'thought experiment' is so thorough that it passes beyond hilarity, beyond cleverness -- though the film has both qualities in abundance -- to reach a level of psychological, even spiritual profundity that puts Groundhog Day in league with the very best examples of its type, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""A Christmas Carol"". All this from a Bill Murray comedy -- who would have thought! (""Scrooged"", Bill's own version of the ""Christmas Carol"" story, wilts in comparison.) Anyone who liked ""The Truman Show"" ought to love this.  It crackles, it surprises, and it even moves, with Murray's dry wit steering us clear of sentimentality.  Watch and enjoy it again and again.",

You can watch this movie as a good-humoured comedy turning around the crazy idea of the same day repeating over and over and have all the fun you can ask for. The cast is great, with Bill Murray going through all the highs and lows coming with his situation, Andie McDowell at her loveliest and Chris Elliott delivering great one-liners. When you start thinking it over, it occurs to you that the script touches on the last questions of human existence. It's not easy to postpone the question about life's sense, when there is no more tomorrow to postpone it until. Watching the flick, you might not immediately notice the plot's depth, just as it takes Bill Murray's character some time to realize the time-loop he's caught in.

781,27 March 2006,bluehippie,10, Accidental Buddhism lesson?,"I'm not sure if anyone else has noticed this, but the movie seems to follow the Buddhist path to enlightenment almost exactly. For anyone who doesn't know, the path is similar to the steps that people go through when dealing with failure or death. First there is confusion, then denial, then anger, then reasoning, and then acceptance. In Buddhism, one has to first realize that there is suffering. Phil does not realize what is happening at first; it's a shock that the day is repeating. He goes to sleep the first few times, hoping the day will change. When it doesn't, he gets angry and begins to kill himself in numerous ways. In Buddhism, this would be akin to living life frivolously. Once Phil realizes this will not end the day, he begins to do good things. This is the bargaining stage. However, this is not true altruism in that he is only doing good in order to escape the day. It is not until he accepts his fate that he begins to do good simply for the sake of doing good, and not for selfish reasons. This is the first real step in attaining enlightenment: accepting that life is suffering, and choosing to ease the suffering of others. Through this idea, Phil is finally able to escape the day, which would be akin to escaping the cycle of reincarnation and attaining nirvana. Essentially, Phil is going through this cycle on a microscopic basis, one day at a time instead of one life at a time. Sorry for the long explanation, I just thought it was fascinating that such a funny and entertaining movie could have such a deep undercurrent, whether the producers meant it or not.",

It has been a wish for centuries. You have heard people say "" I wish I could go back in time and know what I know now"" and to me this is what this movie represents.

791,20 November 2020,areid-75085,10, Twilight-Zone movie,"Groundhog Day is the other feature-length film of the Twilight Zone and like the Twilight Zone, it's neither good nor bad it just is. Like the Twilight Zone, the time loop is never explained on why it started, why the main heroine falling in love genuinely was important or him falling in love with the town as well. It's like a slow burn where Phil loses his mind. We start off by getting to know him and understanding his personality. He's arrogant and narcissistic, pretty much an unlikeable guy that hates the setting of the movie. Then we get to the loop of the film when Phil realizes that he is constantly repeating the day and feels hopeless. Then he has this epiphany that he can do whatever he wants. He is later seen taking advantage of the time loop and using it to satisfy his desires. He binge eats, smokes, steals money, and sleeps around (Groundhog Day, 34:00-40:00). He's living a carefree life and doing as he pleases. This scene is where the Twilight Zone episode starts. As we watch him do all of the things that frankly anyone one would do if given the opportunity we start to see that doing whatever he wants is getting boring and really wants to get out. Then as the movie progresses we start to see not only personality-wise but physically how this is taking a toll on him. When he starts helping people out there is this scary wisdom behind his eyes. The man literally remembers killing himself with a groundhog he saw his own death. Yeah, he gives the homeless man money, gets coffee to his coworkers, learns how to play the piano, and ice sculpts. He even dedicates his time to save the old homeless man. He then spends the next loop saving and helping everyone. Then he is thanked by everyone at the party (Groundhog Day, 1:10:25- 1:29:00). Through this montage of him helping people and him growing as a person, we should also remember that he was basically broken down mentally to get to this place of kindness and wisdom by this supernatural force that has no origin. With all of that being said I love this movie. It's promoted as being a Romantic Comedy but when looking at it from a modern perspective it's actually a psychological supernatural comedy film with a dash of dark humor. It's really fascinating how time and shifts the tone and mood of a film. I recommend people watching this movie only to see how messed up in a classic Twilight Zone way it is.",
792,2 January 2007,wcsrevu,10," ""Groundhog Day"": Philosophical/Spiritual Messages","If I were to classify this film, I think I'd call it ""Romantic Comedy/Fantasy"". But that hardly does it justice. Bill Murray, as the obnoxious Pittsburgh weatherman Phil Connors, is hilarious, as usual. He was the perfect choice to play the self-centered Phil. To sum up the plot, if you haven't seen it: Phil travels to Punxsutawney, PA with producer Rita (Andie McDowell) & cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) to cover the Annual Groundhog Day Celebration. (A real-life event, by the way.) After covering the celebration, they're stranded there by a blizzard. Phil awakens the next morning, or so he thinks, and soon learns a terrible truth: He's entered some kind of time loop & must live the same day over & over, again & again & again... Phil realizes that he can work this to his advantage. At first, he uses it as an excuse to abandon self-control & avoid responsibility. He takes up some unhealthy & risky habits, knowing that he can start over each day. He soon becomes despondent, however & tries to kill himself several times. Of course, he fails for obvious reasons. Eventually, he starts reaching out to help others in the community, which earns him their respect. In the process, he becomes a better person. But more to the point: Beneath the surface, Groundhog Day has a deeper meaning. The basic premise, in itself, raises the question: What power created the temporal loop in the first place? Was it God, karma or some unknown cosmic force? How long was Phil actually in the loop? Days? Years? Centuries? Would time have any meaning while he was in there? I think the movie purposely leaves these things to our imagination. Why has Phil been ""sentenced"" to relive this day indefinitely? Is it a divine judgment on his character? Is this his ""Hell"" or ""Purgatory""? Is his karma catching up with him? Let's look at how Phil's life is changed by his experience: In the beginning, he's rude, obnoxious & self-centered. Being trapped in the time warp, at first, brings out his negative personality traits when he realizes that his behavior can have no apparent consequences. Some examples: He punches out a pushy insurance salesman. He steals money from an armored truck. He uses women, including Rita (on whom he has a serious crush). He smokes, drinks & overeats. He makes rude comments on-camera at the Groundhog Day Celebration. After several unsuccessful attempts at suicide, Phil begins to soften. He begins using the knowledge he's gained to reach out to others. He soon learns how to be in the right place at the right time to help people in need. Some examples of this: He saves the Groundhog Festival emcee from choking. He catches a little boy who falls out of a tree. He changes a flat tire for some elderly ladies. He comes to the aid of a homeless man & prevents him from dying of a heart attack. He even learns to play the piano & takes up ice sculpting. Phil eventually wins Rita's heart. Then he's released from the temporal loop & time again progresses normally for him. We can see, from this, how Phil Connors learns from his mistakes, changes his attitude & his outlook on life, steps out of his self-centered little world & is finally able to show true love & compassion for others. There's a definite theme of redemption & salvation here, which should appeal to Christians. Because Phil is given countless chances to change his ways, this could symbolize God's infinite mercy. This would appeal to Jews, Christians & Muslims alike. Hindus & Buddhists would appreciate how Phil begins to build up good karma through selfless acts of kindness. Phil's eventually release from the time warp may symbolize a rebirth, reincarnation, an ascension to Heaven or some sort passage into the afterlife. In conclusion, Groundhog Day, besides being a great comedy, is rich in symbolism. We could all learn something from it. I highly recommend watching it. If you've already seen it, see it again (& again & again & ...). Yes, I know it was released in 1993, but it's timeless. (Pun intended.)",

821,27 February 2017,benboeck,8, A Great Watch,"Groundhog Day is work a work of marvelous comedy. This comedy exudes from the natural inclination to be humored by the hysterical facial expressions and the unfortunate situations Phil, Bill Murray, is placed in along the ride. It uses the somewhat mind boggling circumstance that the comical Bill Murray is stuck in time, and the situations involving romanticism, death, anarchy, and other natural human desires that may not be the best in certain situations. These experiences Phil finds himself creates not only just amusement and a reason to laugh, but also they make us think and feel for how we would've responded to such a phenomenon as defying space and time. Inspiring us with its progressive attitude of growth and morals, it makes us want to be better people and to mature, hopefully in a far less amount of time that repeating a single day hundreds of times. It exceeds in not just reaching those who want a good laugh, but also accomplishes speaking, through film, to those facing romantic struggles, depression, a weak will to live, and other such issues most humans experience throughout their lifetime. Though it did achieve a lot with such a small concept, related to humanities struggles, and gave us hope for a matured self, I could not reconcile the fact that Rita, Phil's love in the end (played by Andy McDowell), would settle for a man such as Phil. The movie also was vague, other than the fact that Phil had been a jerk and a prideful snob, about the reason that Phil had been sentenced to such a temporary fate as he was in Groundhog Day but it doesn't shed much light off of the great film that it is. It struts many of the great concepts of comedy that we all know and love and influences us to be better people. All in all, it is a stand-up movie that will not disappoint after a lazy night of movie-watching!",

I got some good laughs with this movie but because it kept repeating and with only few changes by the middle of the movie it became quite tedious. The story was good and comical. I definitely recommend this movie.,

824,23 October 2005,nicholas_qd,7, The movie show one guy's quality really.,"I just think it's not only a funny movie ,but also a special,wonderful one .We should thank Danny Rubin,the story writer ,who created a great script for this movie. Bill Murray did very well . When he knew he could live in this day all the time ,he did something that any guys would do: First,sex ; (very easy) Second,a lot of money; (not hard ) Third,a woman he love (very hard ) so,although he knew a lot of things about ""Rita"" ,but he found that the love of woman is very hard to get .In fact ,he understood something should be changed in himself ,and he should know himself , understand the value of people's life and even the meaning of true love .So, he tried to change himself ,and he did it in the end . From all of comments above ,we even can get a standard way of many guys ,they work very hard ,they earn money for fun or sex ,but they can't get true love of woman he love .It's so sarcastic,isn't it? 'Cause that need a big change in himself ,it's the most hard thing,nobody like change ,it's truth ,but they did it in the end just for true love of the woman. so,I think the movie show one guy's quality really.",

826,12 March 2018,CraigHubbardProducer,10, Classic!,Its been over 25 years and some change since I seen this masterpiece of a movie I cant believe it. So many movies have copied this repeat of 1 day but nothing like the original. I love the movies of the 80's and 90's the supporting actors were just as good as the Lead actors! Or just excellent casting directors!,
827,19 May 2018,PepeTehFrog,10, 10 out of 10,I think this was a super funny romance and it was a good idea for bill murry to play phil!,
828,26 June 2018,gildaradner,10, Incredible film!,"Groundhog day proves you don't need to rely on CGI explosions, fart gags or graphic sex to make an entertaining, classic movie. It's full of humanity and heart and genuinely winning performances and that's why it's so loved after all these years. I wish people would still fund midlevel movies like this!!!",
