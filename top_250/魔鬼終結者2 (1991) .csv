0,30 August 2009,TOMASBBloodhound,10, Note to Hollywood: This is how you make an action film.,"And yes, I'd consider this more of an action film than Sci/fi since it takes place in contemporary times and locations. Nowadays, it can be hard to distinguish an action film from a video game. In fact there is one coming out soon that appears to be both. I guess studios these days feel that kids need something to see while resting their fingers after long days of playing their Nintendos/Playstations/whatever. So they come up with all of these PG-13 action films that are often mere meditations of comic books, toys, or old TV shows. Looking back at T2, one may find the action films of today sorely lacking in comparison.",/
1,13 March 2008,851222,10, Movie that everyone should see!,Greetings from Lithuania.,r
2,4 August 2002,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, This is the sequel that dreams are made of.,"Normally when people tell you about a sequel that was better than the original or just as good, Terminator 2 is always guaranteed to be in their list; why? Because this is THE action movie of all action movies, next to Die Hard, this is the movie that isn't just about the action as well, but has an incredible story and message behind it that will always stay with you. Terminator 2 like the first Terminator film has memorable lines, moments, and incredible effects. This is the film that made you believe in ""liquid metal"" machines. Robert Patrick's performance is flawless, to be honest I found him a million times more terrifying than Arnold in the first Terminator, because Robert looks like this normal average guy, but he's not like Arnold where he gets shot and you can clearly see he's a terminator, Robert goes back to human looking and won't stop. Not only that you don't know how to stop him. Linda Hamilton returns and gives a great performance as Sarah Conor who is no longer a meek little girl, she has turned into a strong woman who will do anything to protect her son and the future. Arnold is back and he's better then ever! No wonder in the future they made several terminators that look like him, he's great entertainment.",e
3,5 February 2005,mjw2305,10," This Terminator Sequel, may prove to be the best sequel ever made.","After failing to kill Sarah Conner, the Machines are now trying again, only this time their after John Conner himself, as a boy. Sarah Conner is labelled insane after trying to burn down Cyberdyne Systems, the company that hid the remains of the first terminator she destroyed, and she is committed to a mental institute. John Resents his mother for the way he was brought up, and now lives with his foster parents.",v

5,5 November 2003,MovieAddict2016,10, He Said He'd Be Back...and He Certainly is!,"Who said sequels aren't any good? ""Terminator 2"" is the ultimate sequel, a big bad wolf ready to chomp the head off of anyone who crosses its path. It's dark, it's mean, and it's one tough movie. It's not as bleak as the first film, at least in terms of visuals, but rather has a new kind of bluish-tint that supplies a great backdrop to the ongoing battle between man and machine.",e
6,6 January 2018,ivo-cobra8,10, The best action sequel of all time and one of the best Schwarzenegger's movies my personal favorite,"Terminator 2: Judgment Day is (1991) is the best action sci-fi flick movie from the 90's ever made of all time. Terminator 2 is my personal favorite film I absolutely love this movie to death! Is my number 1 best movie ever till today the best of the best epic movie of all time. T2 was nominated for 4.Oscars the only movie of the franchise was nominated for an Oscar. If you watch T2 carefully and follow the story you never got bored and you are very entertained. This movie kicks ass! I love the hospital scenes mostly at night, the Cyberdyne building action sequences and of course steel mill action sequences are perfect for this film. This film deals with a lot of action, sci-fi and does involves a lot of paradox past travel. There is a lot of explosions and automatic weapons used in the movie and they are used well thousands of bullets are fired and explosive projectiles are fired at the police cars. ",w
7,31 August 2015,TheLittleSongbird,10," A bigger, richer sequel that is every bit as fantastic as its predecessor and even surpasses it in some areas","The original Terminator film is one of the greatest films of the action genre, and still holds up as a fantastic film, not just of its genre but in general too. Terminator 2: Judgement Day is considered one of the best sequels ever made, and it is a consensus that I agree with. While it does lack somewhat in its predecessor's darkness and brutality, it delivers just as much in the writing and action and feels bigger and richer.",/
8,10 July 2021,Calicodreamin,10, Hasta la vista baby,The best terminator movie by far and one of the all time greatest movies ever made. The effects are amazing for the early 90s and hold up even by todays standards. The storyline is easy to follow and the action scenes are amazing. The characters are well cast and the actors sell this movie. An absolute classic.,r
9,3 July 2017,Fella_shibby,10," Awesome action sequences, terrific sound effects n superb cgi. The chase sequence is awesome.","I still remember seeing this movie for the first time in 1993 on a VHS. I was completely blown away by the action, special effects n sound. Bought the VHS in '94 n saw countless number of times that the VHS nearly got burned out. Bought a DVD recently n revisited it. T2 is a timeless movie. It is much better than the original. It has superb car chases, big guns, dynamic explosions, gore, tension, suspense, etc. The chase sequence is awesome and nail bitingly intense, it is one of the best action sequences ever made. The pacing is impeccable and the action sequences still stands out. This movie has awesome sound effects, perfect cinematography n impeccable editing. I don't think there must b an action fan who hasn't seen this movie. It has an awesome cgi, action n sound effects. The scene in the Institute where Arnie walks in slow motion with a shot gun n Patrick, the cold emotionless killer, approaching is so full of tension. This movie also has a creepy n dreadful atmosphere. The movie is very violent n action packed.",w
10,11 November 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, The purest form of action cinema there is,"At the time of release, this was one of the biggest, most expensive, box office hits ever made. Obviously that reputation has long since been diminished by films which have come since, but I still remember the hype and excitement that surrounded this film when I was but a ten year old boy. Containing Arnold Schwarzenegger's most accessible, likable performance, it's difficult to find fault with this near-masterpiece of adrenaline-pumping action.",0
11,30 April 2000,Quinoa1984,10, surpasses the original,"Terminator 2 perhaps shows that Cameron was at least was cognizant of life and its meaning. I mean, this IS the movie where the end of the world has the most impact outside of Dr. Strangelove, right? One of those outstanding dream scenes in movies, one of the ones that actually works because it's true in its savage simplicity, Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor sees herself in her 1984 waitress get up with baby John in a playground and then everything gets wiped out by the BIG BOMB (Dmitri) that also incinerates Hamilton into BBQ.",3
12,2 December 2008,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, There's a reason this is so appreciated,"Let it be said right away: There is at least one obvious issue with this. That doesn't have to include the fact that this is one of those sequels that are so much like the original that one could argue that it's partially a remake. What I'm referring to is that going by the first, it technically shouldn't exist. I am not aware of anyone who considers the predecessor of this to be the only film in this series(I've experienced many who, with good cause, deny there to be a third movie... heck, I am one of them), but I could see why there could be. However, if you look past that(and you ought to at least consider doing so, as this doesn't come off as one of those follow-ups released to cash in on an earlier success), you're in for an undeniably enjoyable and well-done cinematic experience. The plot is interesting and well-told. The pacing is solid. The acting is great from all, Patrick is an incredible addition, and neither Arnie nor Linda have forgotten how to portray their role. The action gets bigger, and still consists of fights, shootouts and car chases, all of which are marvelous and exciting, and never degenerates into stupidity. The guns are still impeccably well-chosen and handled. Really cool. The new concept or two herein are very smart and well-thought out. The science fiction remains well-done. This holds an appropriate amount and volume of self-irony over the title character(though I did not mind the seriousness of the previous silver screen effort). While some of the dark tone is maintained, it is less violent and disturbing than the 1984 piece. There is also no nudity(well, just about) or sexuality in this. I have more points against this, meanwhile, they all give stuff away, and this will remain a spoiler-free review. And even with them, it's hard to argue with the quality of this, even if you prefer The Terminator to it(and I do). I recommend this to any fan of sci-fi, intense scenes, James Cameron, the others who made this, and/or food for thought wrapped neatly in celluloid. 10/10",0
13,14 October 2005,SeminolePhenom,10, Words cannot describe the greatness of this movie,"A Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent from the future to kill the unborn son of Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton) in the original. Now, that Terminator has been sent back again but with a different assignment: Protect John Connor. John Connor(Edward Furlong) is now about 10 years of age and must evade a new Terminator sent to kill him;The T-1000(Robert Patrick). Sarah, John, and The Terminator journey together on their quest to stop Judgement Day, with a trailing, shape-shifting Termiantor trailing from behind.",0
14,26 February 2002,SmileysWorld,9, One sequel that out does the original,"I am not a big fan of sequels,as most of them disappoint,but T2 certainly does not.In fact,it's a rare case,at least in my opinion, of a sequel actually surpassing the original film in terms of greatness.As in 99.9% of his films,Arnold Schwarzenegger is the good guy once again,but you don't mind once you witness the incredible villain performance of Robert Patrick.This film is nothing short of a beginning to end thrill ride.Let us not forget the talents of Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong,who gave great supporting efforts.Thumbs up!",5

18,7 April 2009,shortround8391,10," Schwarzenegger's Best Film, Hands Down","Oh yeah, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""......The greatest overall action film next to ""Die Hard"" and the greatest science fiction one next to ""Aliens"". It is, without a doubt, my favorite movie of all time and I would give this 20 stars if I could and this is a film that everyone recognizes and knows about and this is a film that absolutely gets what it deserves.",?
19,22 March 2010,Ziya90,10, It pushes the limits of greatness,"Probably this is the movie I enjoyed watching the most. Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of my all time favorite actors, I am a huge fan of him. It does not matter whether his acting is great or not (but in this movie, he is great I think) The Terminator 2 has humor at times, but because of that again rather critics give one star low! However, humor in the movie is not to entertain audiences. Humor in this movie results from natural situations, it seems that Cameron does not put such moments for our entertainment like the third Terminator movie. And this humor does not ruin the seriousness and the dark tone of the movie. I can't think of a Terminator movie without Schwarzenegger. I have seen Terminator Salvation and yes, there was Arnold Schwarzenegger too, but CGI! (an awful idea) Terminator Salvation was OK, but not as a Terminator movie, as a post apocalyptic science fiction action. I want to say a few things more about Schwarzenegger. He was an icon by this character. Motorcycle, leather jacket, sunglasses and pump rifle. At this point, this is the most humanist, may be the only action movie ever! One of my favorite one liners is the movie is ''he will live.'' Connor tries to teach him not to kill people. Don't get me wrong, it does not mean that I don't like other action movies which do not give such a message, but this just makes the movie greater and deeper. By the way, Terminator 2 is also the deepest action movie ever. This is one of the movies that when you replace any of the actors, pieces don't fall into place. Schwarzenegger is like he was made for Terminator (and yes Conan too), Robert Patrick was made for T-100 (he was at his best in this movie, may be not for acting, but for performance) and Edward Furlong was made for John Connor. Honestly, personally it was impossible to believe that Nick Stahl is John Connor, I watched him like another character. Furlong portrays a very realistic rover portrait. As for Linda Hamilton, she was not made for Sarah Connor, but it is a big pleasure to watch her and for her acting, real very good. Musics always make me live nostalgia, great musics. Now, let's talk about the scenes. The atari center sequence is the first beyond great sequence. This movie is great entertainment, every time, it is a great pleasure to watch it. From the middle of 1990s till now, I watched the movie almost 50 times. I love the metal holes and then renew. How creative it is. As for visual effects, it is a touchstone, yes still. It is the greatest visual effects of all time to me, till 2012. Now, to me it became the second greatest. And I am sorry, I find the visual effects of T2 much more believable than Avatar. Yes I know, 3D, some other new technologies as well. but this is what I think. At a few moments, it is flawed like the scene they shoot at the face of Schwarzenegger, but no problem at all. Can you believe that this movie was made in 1991? I can't believe at all. That's why it is still a milestone. The chase sequence in the highway is beyond great too. Cameron raised the bar and I used to compare all the chase scenes with this one. Do you know another movie that in user comments, the titles which say the greatest action movie ever are innumerable? Almost everyone says the greatest action movie ever, the best action movie of all time, the greatest, the best... I will say the same thing. This is the greatest action movie of all time. The pump rifle using style of Terminator was getting my attention when I was a child. Still I like that. I just like gunfight scenes, not guns by the way. The hospital sequence is the third beyond great sequence, there are a lot of scenes that deserves cinema anthology in this movie. The coffee scene was incredible, every time makes me remember The Silver Surfer, we get lots of very interesting and brilliant moments like the shoot at head (not just in this sequence, throughout the whole movie) The Terminator is 10 out of 10, but T2 surpasses even that (you know I can't give 11 out of 10) Ohh By the way, I don't recommend you to watch the extended edition, if you are a first time viewer. There are three new scenes in this edition. The scene which Sarah hallucinates, to me a mediocre scene, the scene which T-100 tells Sarah and John where his chip is, an unnecessary scene and the scene which a kind of foreplay and talking between Tarissa and Miles while he works at desk, a cliché and a bit ridiculous scene. Returning to the movie, this is the best cat and mouse game movie with No Country for Old Men, it wouldn't be better. T-1000 is the most powerful, the most resistant (the most indestructible) villain ever! You think that he is terminated, but he is not, will he be terminated this time? The movie delivers such a feeling that I would define great success. Helicopter truck fight is great, another action sequence, I would call the kind of action in the movie metallic, not CGI action. By the way, mercury scene was one of the most shocking moments in the cinema history! Unbelievable, incredible. There is an unaccountable moment which it seems that Hulk was inspired from. Another moment recalls The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King etc. If you watched both movies, you understand what I mean. And T-1000 continues to execute his tricks, I was bowling over every time. This is a non stop action movie, but not shallow at all, not like pure action with no substance, in contrast the deepest action movie ever made.",r
20,25 January 2021,auuwws,10, Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"The best sci-fi action movie I watched, I really enjoyed watching the movie. Terminator's character was excellent and surpassed the first part, Sarah's character was excellent and I liked the development of her character, John's character I did not like, T-1000 was terrifying and I really enjoyed confrontations with the protagonists, the action scenes were great, The visual effects in proportion to its time were great, and still can be watched, the film is the second best action movie I have seen, and I highly recommend watching it.

33,18 February 2006,jamesqt,10, Best action film ever!!!,This superb sequel surpasses the excellent original in every department and quite simply you won't see a better action film.

34,16 March 2023,Elvis-Del-Valle,10, The best installment of the entire saga,"One of the best sequels in history and without a doubt the best of the entire saga, Terminator 2 took the plot of the first film to a higher level. We cannot forget that this was Edward Furlong's first film as an actor and just at that moment he achieved fame, being remembered as John Connor. Linda embodies a rather strong Sarah Connor perfectly, taking the character's story arc to another level. Arnold, of course, gets all the attention being already in the moment and a huge action star. Robert Patrick, as the T-1000 has been the best work of his entire career and he will always be remembered for it. Brad Fiedel's soundtrack brings a lot of life to the film. James Cameron's direction is flawless compared to the previous installment. Stan Winston's special effects are not far behind and digital animation has given the T-1000 a lot of life, making it one of the best villains in cinema. This film could have given a good closure to the saga, although due to the greed of the producers it was not possible, but even so it is an excellent film in both the action and science fiction genres. My final grade for this movie is 10/10.",
35,10 December 2006,GOWBTW,10," He said, ""I'll Be Back"", and he did!","The Terminator failed to destroy Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton). This time, The T-800(Arnold Schwarzenegger) is here on a different mission; to protect Sarah and her son John(Edward Furlong) from a highly advanced terminator, known as the T-1000(Robert Patrick). This terminator is so elusive and so lethal, ingenuity is the main factor in order to stop it. Like the T-800, the T-1000 can't be stopped by bullets. The T-1000 kills John's foster parents. How did he kill the foster mother? I don't wanna know. Sarah's distrust in the terminator was easy to spot, when this tries to help, she was left with no choice but to trust him. And she did. When he stitched her up, her trust in it grew. And the battle scenes between the cops and the terminator was no contest. Not one police officer was killed. The way the could stop the T-1000 was obvious, liquid nitrogen and explosives. Even though, he couldn't self terminate, he had to be destroyed with the same liquid metal that did the T-1000. Simply because, regular ammunition would be a total waste. And furthermore, other super-geniuses could reconstruct it. So he went down, honorably! This movie has more action than the first, and it's a bigger keeper as well. Watch it, and live it! 5 stars!",

38,23 July 2021,nickenchuggets,10," ""Come with me if you want to live""","It is a pretty rare occurrence when a movie is hyped up to no end and actually manages to deliver on its promises. It is also rare for a movie sequel to be even better than the one that came before it, and Terminator 2 nails both of these things. Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his character from the first movie; a robotic warrior sent back in time from the future, but now, things are a little different. The first film has him going back in order to kill Sarah, but now he is trying to protect her son from a cyborg more dangerous than he is. There are many reasons why this movie is better than its predecessor, but it has a lot to do with the inclusion of more depth. In the first Terminator, they focus on humanity's fate at the hands of Skynet, but they never really got far into the story of Skynet itself. It is basically a network of supercomputers working together to control the robots that will bring about the human race's downfall. What makes it so dangerous is its special ability to send advanced cyborg killers (terminators) back in time in order to kill important targets. Being made of metal, they are difficult to take down, and T2 introduces an even greater threat in the form of the T-1000, who serves as the primary villain. The story itself follows John Connor, son of Sarah Connor from the first film. Even at his young age, he is apparently aware that he is destined to lead a revolt against Skynet. Skynet as it turns out is planning to obliterate everything on earth with nuclear missiles in the summer of 1997. With his mother imprisoned for trying to blow up a key installation, Skynet responds by sending a T-1000 back in time to eliminate John. This new model of terminator is a special breed of assassin. It has a very unusual composition and appears to be made of mercury or liquid metal. Using the strange material that covers its body, it can shapeshift into almost anything, allowing it to hide in plain sight. It almost catches up with John, but the original terminator (Arnold) saves him and they escape on a motorcycle. The two then bail Sarah out of the hospital, which leads to John and his mother learning the history of Skynet. They discover the person responsible for creating it is named Miles Dyson, and he's working on a microprocessor that will eventually become Skynet. It's now Sarah's job to hunt him down, but she is unable to kill him in front of his wife and kids. After much patience, John is able to tell Dyson about what horrible consequences his invention will yield, which convinces him to break into Cyberdyne's headquarters in order to blow up his lab. Dyson is killed by the police, but manages to destroy his research before he is killed. Meanwhile, the T-1000 pursues John and the others to a remote location that contains molten metal. After an intense brawl, the terminator pushes the T-1000 into a pool of molten steel, which melts its entire body. The main enemy of the movie is gone, but the terminator tells John he wants John to kill him. This is so that Cyberdyne can't utilize his core processing unit to reconstruct Skynet. In a very depressing ending, John is forced to say goodbye to his protector and friend as he is lowered into the burning metal, never to come back. Whichever way you view this movie, it's the epitome of action. It must have been a very difficult job on their part to best the first movie, but they managed it somehow. There are so many parts in this movie that make you feel terrified or excited because of how many things are going on. I'll never forget how awesome it was to see Arnold load a Winchester model 1887 shotgun with one arm while he's on the motorbike. He holds the gun by its lever and flips it 360 degrees, which loads the next cartridge. I'm pretty sure doing it in real life is impossible and its just a prop gun in the movie, but it looks pretty cool. Another standout is the dream, or rather nightmare, Sarah has that is a realistic depiction of what the nuclear apocalypse talked about in the movie might look like. Entire cities are turned to dust, people are reduced to skeletons instantly, and the entire horizon erupts into blinding light. Schwarzenegger in the first film was a villain sent back in time to kill Sarah, so in the sequel, it's more powerful to see him turn into a hero. To sum things up, Terminator 2 is a rare example of a sequel that easily tops the original, and Arnold definitely has enough machine guns, grenade launchers, rifles, shotguns and strategic thinking to save the human race from certain destruction. One of the 90's most famous movies, hands down.",

40,7 August 2005,Bogmeister,10," Still Unstoppable, Still Relentless","The first Terminator pic was a modest success at the box office in 1984; by 1990, thanks to video, millions of people were anxious for a sequel. James Cameron granted their wish and again exceeded expectations. This sequel is 10 years later, based upon the age of the central character (played by newcomer Ed Furlong). Cameron had a budget of over a dozen times the original picture and used it all to great effect. Notably, this was an early use of computer FX which are prevalent today; back then, they were simply amazing to behold (this was before even Jurassic Park '93, and each instance of their use was startling - we weren't used to it). Most of them revolved around the T-1000 super-villain (Patrick), a revolutionary approach to depicting a fantastic menace. Arnold was back as another durable cyborg, but seemed quaint & outmoded as the picture progressed.",

Yes, James Cameron was allowed a budget for 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' due to his own success, as well as the cult following part one had. But, he didn't stop at simple special effects. He took his original, interesting and origin story and blasted it in fast forward, excellently. Hamilton apparently refused to return unless her character expanded, and it did, tenfold. Schwarzenegger was given more lines, most hilarious, and a lot more in depth was his cyborg. Also, was the addition of excellent acting of Morton, Patrick and soon-to-be notorious Furlong, a full-length story of his own origins. Not only was 'T2' a perfect summer movie, not only did it surpass the original, it is absolutely one of the best action movies of all time. And, like part 1, it's mostly about the story and acting. I cringe at most so-called ""action"" movies of today (SEE: 'Transformers' 1 & 2. Sure there's FX to spare, but where's the story? Where's the acting?) This movie, a continuation of part one with Sarah, now the mother of the future resistance leader John, protecting him (or is he protecting her?) while a new duo of terminators sent back in time to protect and/or destroy. They up'd the ante for action, dialogue, comedy, score, suspense, heart with special and original effects – this one set the ""liquid metal"" stage. I can go on and on, but seriously, this is what real big budgeted movies should model themselves after. First, get a great and original story. Then hire accomplished actors who can, yes, act. Next, employ real FX-experts. How hard of a code is that? I truly believe parts 1 and 2 are a complete story. It should've ended here.",

Director James Cameron had previously achieved unexpected success with 'The Terminator (1984),' a moody and relentlessly bleak tech-noir thriller. The inevitable sequel came armed with a blockbuster budget and state-of-the- arts visual effects, and it is a triumph on every level. The two films are very different, of course – just as Cameron's 'Aliens (1986)' was very different from Ridley Scott's 'Alien (1979).' The first Terminator film was a down-and-dirty dystopian sci-fi, where the modern-day setting is just as drab and ominous as the terrifying future. In 'Judgement Day,' Cameron juggles a tricky juxtaposition of hope and despair. The blindingly-vivid 1990s action sequences feel as though they were captured in the flash of a nuclear explosion, and their dazzling intensity make our glimpse of a bleak, war-ridden future all the more horrific.",

55,11 July 2015,zardoz-13,10, The Best Terminator Movie!!!,"Sequels rarely surpass originals, but ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" provides the exception to the rule. Writer & director James Cameron has outdone himself with this follow-up film to his seminal sci-fi, time travel, yarn about men and machines. In the original, a Cybernetic organism classified a Terminator appeared from the future to execute Sarah Connor, while the mankind resistance army of the future dispatched a warrior back to 1984 to save Sarah from certain death. Kyle Reese showed up and helped Sarah kill the Terminator. Nevertheless, although our heroine managed to survive the nightmarish ordeal and have a baby before she hightailed it to Mexico, Cyberdyne Systems acquired the forearm of the Terminator that she killed in the machine press and Sarah eventually wound up locked away in custody at the Pescadero Mental Hospital. Miraculously, Sarah's ten-year son John Connor (Edward Furlong in his first role) has been farmed out to foster parents, Janelle (Jenette Goldstein) and Tod Voight (Xander Berkeley), but is living the life of a low-grade hoodlum ripping off automated teller devices at banks when another Terminator designated a T-1000 (Robert Patrick) shows up to kill him. Unlike the enemy Terminator in ""The Terminator,"" the T-1000 is a highly advanced model that consists of liquid metal and can alter its shape. Essentially, the T-1000 is far more formidable than the earlier Terminators, and it gives our heroes a run for their money. As it turns out, the Resistance has rewired a T-800 (Model 101) Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger of ""Red Sonja"") and sent him back to 1995 to protect John. The outcome is a thoroughly exciting action thriller that raises the stakes where the villainous Terminators are concerned. Cameron and co-writer William Wisher have supplemented the plot with some humor as young John Connor helps the Terminator fit into society by saying familiar phrases. The T-1000 is a truly menacing adversary for our heroes and they have to keep on blasting away at it because it can repair itself in no time. As Sarah Connor, Linda Hamilton has undergone a transformation from being a vulnerable waitress to being a lean, mean doll who fights the Terminator. Initially, when John and the T-101 show up at the mental asylum, they have to battle the T-1000 and escape by the hair of their chin. You won't find a better sci-fi actioneer than ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" and some of the dialogue is funny.",

58,10 July 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, He's back.,"Though its predecessor works best if its events are predestined, it also makes sense if they're constantly in flux, sending ripples through time to change the outcome of a future that previously seemed so certain. This is the premise for 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)', a sequel that decides to elaborate on a line (""the future is not set"") and a deleted scene from Cameron's 1984 classic. The result is a film that feels about as natural as possible for a follow-up to one of the most complete science-fictions of all time. It only retcons a couple of small, almost inconsequential elements. The decision to bring Schwarzenegger back as the 'good guy' could have been hokey, but it ends up as a distinct and inspired choice that also allows for an exploration of some fairly compelling themes. I don't think it works quite as well as having him as the villain, though. In general, the piece isn't anywhere near as tight as the first - in fact, it's quite baggy - and it feels almost as though its story is being found as it goes. The initial act is actually quite slow and, frankly, almost dull. There's also an extended segment in the second act which really slows the pace, despite having many interesting character moments and introducing what is, essentially, a well-developed 'side-plot' - which should have been the main focus throughout. I think this part feels so slow because, despite being engaging in its own right, it stops the flick's driving force, that being the extended chase with the T-1000, dead in its tracks. Once the final movement kicks in, the chase invigoratingly picks back up and the focus is placed wholly back on it, making the previous forty minutes seem like a bit of a detour. However, even though there are some issues with the storytelling and pacing, the picture is perhaps the king of set-pieces. There are several extended action scenes - each brought to life with amazing physical stunt-work and still-astonishing special effects (both practical and CG) - which stand out as some of the best in the genre. It's difficult to express just how far these sequences go in making the experience as enjoyable as it is; they compensate, in a way, for the piece's other flaws. It's a shame, then, that the thing is as slow and inconsistent as it is, as it could have been a downright masterpiece. Still, it's a phenomenal feat of filmmaking and a fantastically fun time as a whole. I wouldn't say it's as good as the first, but it's still one of the best examples of its genre. It's entertaining, exciting and every bit as action-packed as it's made out to be. 8/10",

The story picks up many years after the original that finds Sarah Connor (played with vulnerability and intensity by Linda Hamilton) in a mental institution and her now punk teen son John (played to a tee by Edward Furlong) who's living with foster parents. John's world comes crashing down however with the arrival of a terminator (played once again by Arnold Schwarzenegger who does a great job in the role) whose been sent from the future to protect the young soon to be leader of the resistance from a deadly time traveling cyborg known as the T-1000 (played to perfection by Robert Patrick) an advanced prototype which makes it that much more dangerous. Soon The Terminator is in a race against time to protect Sarah and John from a formidable foe it may not be able to defeat. The whole cast are exceptional in their roles especially Schwarzenegger who does a fantastic job as the Terminator, Linda Hamilton still proves to be a perfect Sarah Connor, and Robert Patrick makes for an effective villain. He may not have much dialogue but Patrick makes the best of his villain role in the movie. Well done. Director James Cameron continues the story from the original and gives us a worthy sequel that is much better than the first one. From the intense action which is pretty much non stop, to the acting, to the characters, the story, the suspense, thrills, and some small does of humor this sequel makes for an enjoyable movie to watch. The special effects are amazing especially considering they didn't have the technology we do today. Despite some flaws when dealing with the time-traveling plot and some over acting at times the good more than outweighs the bad. Overall Terminator 2 is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made with plenty of action, chases, explosions, fist fights, amazing special effects, solid performances, a compelling story, and some humor that sure to please any fan of the series or genre.

I don't doubt that the movie has amazing special effects that makes the movie quite watchable if you just want to vegatate for a couple of hours. I don't doubt that there  might be a few plot holes and discontinuity in the time travel aspect of the story. This is something I have yet to figure out.   But after watching this movie a few times and reading critical reviews of the movie, I've come to this current opinion. If you bother to think about this movie beyond the great special effects, you might find that it has more to offer than the cool F/X. James Cameron is a very critical and detail oriented director. If you are familiar with his work at all, you will see an emerging theme in all of his movies. I believe that theme is humanity vs. technology. (THE ABYSS, TITANIC, ALIENS) In any case, the characters are an INTEGRAL part of the story and not simply the platform in which the action takes place. Compare this movie to say, practically any Jerry Bruckheimer movie. (Gone in Sixty Seconds anyone?) James Cameron thinks about his characters first before he can imagine the situation in which they may reasonably be confronted with. James Cameron says himself that the intent of the movie was to make people feel for a robot, to cry for him, and not simply to be blown away by the action taking place within the context of the characters and the story.",

A sci-fi/action masterpiece that is superior to the original,"In the first ""The Terminator"" movie The Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) did the chasing and hunting for it's target. Well this time the roles have been reversed but it's still more exciting and thrilling than the original. This is almost a flawless sequel and the definition of a sequel done right. This most is most definitely a sci-fi masterpiece that is engaging and highly entertaining from beginning to end. The plot is very well written and it's very memorable, especially some of the quotes. There is almost no flaw to this movie and will stick with audiences for a very long time. Definitely worth seeing to anyone that enjoy watching movies should most definitely check this movie out. The villain this time around T-1000(Robert Patrick) is very intimidating and scary at times, in another words he is a great villain even if the T-1000 is silent most of the time. I remember seeing this film a long time ago during my childhood and it stuck with me. Without giving much away, I will end this review by saying it's a sci-fi masterpiece and anyone would be missing out big time if they don't see this movie.",

The sound design is also excellent, memorable and pretty-much faultless. The writing is fantastic and this is what, combined with the groundbreaking effects, elevates this to be a truly timeless classic. The acting and characters contribute to the story and effects. It's not one aspect that is good, it is all aspects of this film. I even like the 3D conversion they did, it gave us another way to watching this classic. The story really builds on the first film. The action is exciting. The pacing perfect. Shame James Cameron's newer films are not as good, along with Aliens (1986) this is the peak of his career in my opinion.

The film-makers turned the table interestingly and it worked: Arnie was this time the good guy, setting up the stage for the older model but likable good guy robot-killer, now back to protect, vs the newer technology evil robot, and where Arnie was all heavy metal with boots and dark shades with heavy punches and kicks and robust weaponry, bad guy T-1000 was smooth, stealthy, lightning quick, surgically precise and sharp, while superior in intelligence and strategy. Put this way, it makes for quite an exciting prospect of a plot on its own, doesn't it ? And the movie delivers. The superiority of the T-1000 is well illustrated, and Arnie and the heroes keep up/escape in a believable way. The film even manages to generate emotion from the viewing public towards a robot, and nobody from this past radius of contemporary generations will ever, ever forget that ending, with Arnie's thumb raised. Globally, an excellently executed sci-fi action from the early 90's. James Cameron did another superb job there, and the film may not be the deepest in cinema history, but it sure provides the goods it promises, and for a sequel, and a sequel that's widely regarded as even superior to its original, an absolute classic in its own right; this is pretty damn strong.",

Among them: Robert Patrick's delicately featured T1000 comes across as almost scarier and more ruthless than the original Series 101 (Arnold's role reprised, sort of...he's GOOD in this sequel), more screen time for Earl Boen as Dr. Silberman, and of course, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor.",

The cinematography and camera shots are beautiful. Notice the color schemes particularly in the asylum (blue-gray) and the foundry (orange-red). The ""visions"" scenes are very inspired and memorable. The action is intense, engrossing and escalating as it should be.

This film does however feature some insanely massive set pieces and the action is upped from the originals 6 million budget to this films 100 million budget. Cameron's direction is tense and the imaginative story once again is made simple to allow for the characters to hold the movie rather than a complex plot.

It does help to see the first film first but in my opinion it stands on its own as a great film therefore it is not crucial. The quality starts at the beginning and continues throughout its 2 hours 20 minutes. I seem to recall Terminator 2 getting a cool welcome and mixed reviews at the time of its release in England. Fortunately the vast majority of people who have seen this film rate it very highly. This film has everything anyone might want from it, everything for me just feels right. I have read a lot of the reviews of this film and most of them are very eloquent about its contents and wax lyrical about this or that or all of the bits that make it up. I simply look at the whole and it is greater than the sum of its parts which I know isn't logical but it really is extremely enjoyable to watch. Like all great films the viewer needs to pay attention to the detail, it is well worth the effort, because it is clear that a great deal of time and effort went into the making of this film and all of the team that were responsible for the outcome should be satisfied on a job well done. I highly recommend anyone watch this film and you will probably find yourself watching it over and over again.

The reality is that for a substantial portion of its running time, Terminator 2 is anything but. Honor where honor is due - James Cameron managed to convince a film studio to give him a nine-figure budget to make a film, and it turned a not-insubstantial profit. That feat alone takes excellent film-making skills along with a good understanding of one's market.

The action sequences are astonishing. Every chase after chase, the action gets better and better. This is a good sequel to a good movie.

Keeping aside the effects, the movie is still an excellent sci-fi action with a heart-touching story and memorable characters. Also should not forget the first terminator film which inspired all these sequels, of which only T2 makes remarkable use.",

I don't know a soul who doesn't like this film. Me personally, I though this would just be another shame to the original, make lots of money, and throw in some effects just to make a good profit. But I was wrong in every sense of the word. James Cameron has come over and beyond, not just mine, but everyone's expectations and has put together a film that doesn't just focus on action or effects, but focuses on the characters as well. Which is why I like older movies better than newer movies. The thing about older movies is that since back in those days, there was no such thing as CGI, so instead of making the monsters or whatever look real and convincing, they made they characters convincing as well. Now, we could make a movie that is entirely CGI, and the problem with that is, that instead of focusing on the characters, they focus more on making the monster or whatever as real as possible, but they forget about making the characters real.

Now, I must say that, having just watched it on DVD after having not seen it since it was playing in theaters, it's a better movie than I initially thought. Back then, I remembered it being a case of stunning special effects and amazing stunts trumping the basic story and characters (much like Independence Day), this in contrast to T-1 where they merely complemented them.

The special effects are phenomenal and still hold up today, of course you can see more of the flaws but they don't take you out of the film. Arnold is just Arnold but he does give more vulnerability to the role than he did in the original and yet he remains bad ass. Then there is the phenomenal performance of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor watching it again recently I realized how good of a performance she gives in this not just emotionally but how much she really became the character physically. There are so many good action scenes in this that I can't just mention one that stands out, but one of my favorites is the causeway chase at the beginning. Last but not least I want to mention Edward Furlong's performance this was his first film and you can tell that sometimes he is unsure but the performance grows on me every time I watch the movie.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is at the top of his game returning to play the cyborg the T-800, his most famous movie role. James Cameron's love of Science Fiction and action coupled with the latest film making technology pushed the boundaries in 1991 to their limit. James Cameron uses classical action shots that allow the viewer to see what is going on at all times, something newer film makers/ editors should pay attention to. The reason this film works so well is down to the story itself and the concepts it deals with, James Cameron always writes interesting stories for us to think about but were he differs to 99% of other directors is he merges this with jaw dropping set pieces filmed with energy, often a moving camera shot he totally understands that this is an entertainment medium, he never forgets about his characters though and this why his films always have heart.

166,22 August 2008,kyle-cruse,8," Good sequel, though I prefer the original","There's no reason why I should prefer the first film in this series to ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" Perhaps the original is more of a classic and a personal favorite to me. This sequel goes for more in-depth with plot and character development than the previous film. However, there are several reasons why this film simply cannot measure up to its predecessor. First, this is far more violent than the original. It seems that every couple of minutes someone is either getting shot, beat down, or thrown through glass. Also, I dislike the character of Sarah Connor in this film. She is shown as a far more aggressive and tough woman than in the last movie, which can be unappealing to many. The movie also drags on a little too long in the last couple of scenes and really could have ended sooner, with less action and fighting sequences. Nevertheless, the chase scenes in this movie are some of the most fun and exciting ones I have ever seen. After watching it a few times, it starts to become a classic. Most of the film's elements are masterfully done, right down to the classic scene with the Terminator entering as George Thorogood and the Destroyers' ""Bad to the Bone"" plays, as well as the well-known ""Hasta la vista, baby!"" Could be improved upon, but an enjoyable film that lives up to its reputation and a newer sci-fi classic.",
167,2 October 2001,lotus_chief,6, Not as good as the original....,"Terminator 2, overall, is a good film. For its time (1991) the special effects is simply amazing. The whole story is excellent for a sci-fi film. But, the original is a better film on the whole. John Connor for example....is simply horrible in this film. I can't remember ever having to hear a voice more annoying than his in a movie. Because he is one of the main characters...we're forced to see him a lot, and unfortunately HEAR him a lot. There are certain scenes that are a bit corny or cheesy if you will... but I kinda expect that from James Cameron. Robert Patrick made himself pretty much here...I don't think anyone else could've played the T-1000 the way he did. The original Terminator was much more colder and darker....which I prefer for such a heavy story. I feel the story was more concrete in the original as well. Overall I enjoyed the film...despite the amazing special effects...I'm not sure if it surpasses ""The Predator"", done 4 years earlier. I give it a 6/10...but the original was better. And now that I hear Cameron will not do Terminator 3, I highly doubt if I will even bother with that sequel.",
168,25 September 2003,carflo,10, Wow,"I am watching T2 on TV again tonight.  It is still Wow, even on a small screen TV.  The first time I saw it was at IMAX & that was a hundred times Wow.  I feel sorry for anyone who didn't see it on a big screen back then. The effects in T2 were revolutionary.  Kids who have grown up seeing the morphing in Tv commercials cannot imagine how impressive it was.  If I remember correctly, it was the most expensive movie made to date.  Those new effects cost millions & millions to develop.  Everyone in the audience was blown away by those effects.  For weeks after it opened, everyone at work stood around just talking about the effects, even people who really weren't movie people.  It is one thing to talk about revolutionary special effects, but it was really special to experience it. What was even better was that the rest of the movie lived up to the effects. Cameron put so much into the effects and the action without sacrificing any of the human elements that have to be there to make a truly great movie.  In another 20 years, the effects will by passe, but the ploting will still be tight and the directing superb.  But mostly for me, it is the characters: the Terminator and Sarah and John and Dyson & his family.  I like them, I care about them, I can cry for them.  Robert Patrick is even scarier than Arnold was is T1 (that Terminator only becomes truly chilling after the skin is gone). If you like Aliens, you've got to see T2.  And if you liked T2 please see Aliens.  I hope you enjoy both.  I certainly have many times.",

Those scenes take place in Los Angles' flood control system between a motorcycle, a truck and a second motorcycle; an escape from a mental institution which primarily takes place on foot within the dark and precise confines of bleak, colourless corridors before branching out into an individual chasing a car load of protagonists; before finally settling for what is arguably the best of the three: a thrilling chase on a public highway between a SWAT van and a pursuing helicopter.

It contains not a single irrelevant scene, and there are all scenes brief and to the point. And the choice of not adding any distractive music as the movie go along is very important and well done. About the star Arnold Schwarzenegger, I must say that he is the one that no one'd replace for this movie. He really makes us believe that he is a terminator and not a human, although he is trying to be one very well. And about Edward Furlong, I must say that he plays the role of the smart and innocent kid real good. Impressive!.. The tears in his eyes, while he struggles for the life of humans... Well done! About the script, I say it is very humane after all. You see, we build machines and kill each other from the beginning of history. And we never stop shedding blood. And in this movie, James Cameron did the best to prove that we hold the most value as human being and we should never ever hurt ourselves, with or without the hopeless inventions. I should say that James Cameron and his stuff did great. Bravo!.. (Here is the one of perfect themes: ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhWs3DVk-FU"")",

And at the time, the effects were amazing, sort of like how many feel about Avatar today, but is this film really one of the best of all time?

This is really James Cameron at his finest, with all kinds of breath-taking effects and action scenes that are about as pure as action scenes can get. CGI can do miracles sometimes, but nothing can really top a good old-fashioned motorcycle-truck chase with constant shotgun blasts. I make the movie sound somewhat dumber than it really is though, because it actually takes some time out for real character development as well. The friendship between an average boy and a robot who somehow learns to have feelings (kinda) could be a movie all by itself, here's it's just a really beautiful side story. Granted, Edward Furlong can be pretty annoying in some scenes, but he's pretty darn tough to hate during the climax.

Sequels like these are exceptionally rare and come only once in a blue moon. In the summer of 1991, Director James Cameron left a long lasting impression on audience with this exciting and visually stunning sequel to the 1984 science-fiction classic 'Terminator', with Arnold Schwarzenegger in arguably his most iconic role. Exploding with groundbreaking computer-generated visuals and energy-fueled special effects, this sequel to the 1984 predecessor continuing the storyline with a plot more fleshed out than ever and more compelling character exploration than what James Cameron brought us in the first outing. And the results are nothing short of impressive or fun. From the opening scene showing the massive shoot out between the terminators followed by the burning landscape in the opening credits, to the ending; this movie James Cameron delivering his outstanding flair of filmmaking to the screen. Terminator 2: Judgement Day sees Schwartznegger return as T-800, a robot sent back in time to the year 1995 to protect John Conner (played by Edward Furlong) the preteen son of Sarah Conner (played by Linda Hamilton -- who he tried to kill in the first film) who is now imprisoned in a mental facility, from a liquid metal shape-shifting robot named T-1000 (played by Robert Patrick), who sets out to kill the young lad.",

The 1984 film was made on a meagre budget of $6.4 million and made somewhere around the $50 million mark. This sequel had a $100 million budget and has so far earnt over $620 million.

This time, he is sent back in time to protect 13 year old John Conner. John is the future resistance leader. Another Terminator is sent back in time to eliminate John and his mother Sarah Conner. Sarah is in a mental institution for trying to blow up Skynet, who is behind the future Terminator attack. Once she is out, she will not give up with her plans. Terminator 2 has a better villain. I first saw The original Terminator film and wasn't quite convinced that Arnold was a villain. Though he was. I was too used to seeing Arnold the good guy. But this liquid Terminator( Robert Patrick) is really cool. T2: Judgement day is a rare sequel that is better than the original. This is by far the best of the four Terminator films.

Second off the main spectacular things about T2 are the special effects, unbelievable, especially the part where the T-1000 morphs out of the floor and into the shape of the cop. Third is the acting which is excellent. Especially Linda Hamilton's super performance as Sarah Connor. Sarah is not insane, but also not exactly sane either. It a brilliant performance to pull that off and Hamilton pulls it off perfectly. Great Movie 10/10",
211,3 August 2007,bobbyf,6, Chase movie with eye candy...nothing more.,"I just watched this film again last night - right after I watched the last 20 minutes of ""The Blues Brothers."" I could have sworn I was watching the same movie- a chase movie. Lots of chasing and crashing and so on. Yes, the original has that component to it, but the heart and soul of the first film is the love story which is totally lacking from this film. There are moments in the first film that are terrifying. Nothing about this second installment impacted me in the same way. The suspense just wasn't there. It's also hard for me to care about any of the characters. Furlong's debut performance is two-dimensional: cocky and arrogant or screaming and whining. Arnold is much better as the cold-hearted villain- a element of the story that Robert Patrick's character, the T1000 falls short of delivering; and a twisted Sarah Connor that has little or no resemblance of the original character from ""The Terminator."" The dialog throughout the movie is corny. Trying to humanize the Terminator machine is ridiculous. (""Now I know why you cry."" ugh.) There is no denying that the movie has amazing special effects- though dated now- and that the chase/action scenes are ground-breaking. But to me, the things that make a movie great are well-developed characters and a story I care about. I own this film, and think it's a fair sequel. But it is hardly the masterpiece that many make it out to be.",

214,4 September 2006,fmarkland32,10, The verdict is out...,"Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the T-800, a cyborg protector this time sent to defend John Connor (Edward Furlong) against the T-1000(Robert Patrick) who can shift, morph and seems practically invincible. Also on board to aid in the survival of mankind is Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who decides not only to stop the T-1000 but also stop judgment day from ever happening. It is interesting that a couple of reviewers have said that this is one of the rare cases where a sequel is better than the original, like The Godfather Part II. I myself am not one to debate since I think that like The Godfather parts 1 and 2 are on a par with each other, as both of them are better in different ways. Ergo the same goes with Terminator 2. Terminator 2 is bigger budgeted and works far better as an action movie but isn't quite as successful as the suspense fueled classic of the original. Also The Terminator is quite possibly the greatest B.movie ever made where as Terminator 2 is a classic blockbuster. Whatever the case I have to cave in and acknowledge the fact that I can't tell you which one is better as this movie has everything you could possibly want in a genre film. Terminator 2 is excellent in it's pace, action sequences, special effects and acting. It moves fast and it has been intensely put together. So in the end it is kind of like the same questions posed by Alien and Aliens, both are better in ways than each other because there are elements that each hold in their classic regard. I will say this though, Terminator 2 contains special effects that are still more spectacular (Even more so) than most movies today.",

As usual there are certain twists in the story: what was bad is now good and the characters are subjected to enormous challenges to prove that the human race can overcome a future catastrophe produced by crazed robots.

219,6 May 2020,Ruskington,8, 'How are we supposed to know?',"One of the few genuinely great sequels. After the menacing masterpiece of The Terminator, Judgment Day manages to successfully develop the story without treading over old ground or losing the qualities that made the original so special. Linda Hamilton continues her progression to genuine action hero and Schwarzenegger's re-purposing as a good guy allows him to express himself slightly more as an actor. He brings a very subtle level of sweetness and humour to the role that is underappreciated. My main issue with the film is the final 30-40 minutes which become a little childish. The final showdown is dragged out unnecessarily and the setting is like something out of an arcade game. Despite that, the movie still sits head and shoulders above the vast majority of sci-fi and action films of the last few decades.",

T2 does not only action, but drama, suspense and sci-fi as well. Going for a lighter, less mature atmosphere, James Cameron turned this movie into a giant action success that rivals all else. One of the things that T2 does that few have accomplished: using visual effects to your advantage. The T-1000 is easily the most marvellous thing you'll even see on the screen, not once do the amazing visual effects distract from the experience. The action scenes in here are just as impressive, from the fight in the mall hallway to the freeway chase scene, there is not an ounce of action missing from any of those scenes. And when cars aren't chasing each other or guns blazing, there is some serious plot development that makes you think, about nuclear war and of the future, which is in our hands. The acting excels, nobody, and I mean nobody could play a Terminator robot like Arnold does; nobody could portray the serious, on-the-edge Sarah Connor like Linda Hamilton does. Robert Patrick probably wouldn't be your first choice for a villain, but in here, he shows his intimidating side by providing us with a dark look at the future of assassin robots. The music is absolutely amazing, the main theme just sends a chill down my spine whenever I hear it, an amazing achievement.",

Due to its involving and breath-taking story along with impressive performances. The plot even having some similarities with the first movie isn't remotely predictable or boring. The tension, the soundtrack and how the action scenes were shot provided a feeling of always look up your shoulder because something is after you. But the film is not only actions scenes, in the interval between the action scenes, the characters have their chance to be explored and developed making each one have a good and solid identity during the entire picture. One aspect which is new is the humour, the relationship between John Connor (Edward Furlong) and the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is responsible for this to happen. Other point worth mentioning is the visual effects, specially the makeup used in the T-800 is so realistic, at times there is a certain discomfort because you know that action would hurt, but as he is a robot, that is nothing.

Not only does it have very skillfully played-out action scenes, but it's also filled with some of the most incredible melodies I've ever heard, a factor that, simply, counts for at least 35% of the total excitement and feelings that the movie brings. In addition to being very well made, with no dull scenes whatsoever, this movie actually brings up some interesting questions. In one scene, John Connor looks at two little boys fighting, and asks a robot: ""We're not gonna make it, are we? People, I mean?"" and it replies: ""It's in your nature to destroy yourselves."" I don't think one realizes right away how deep this small comment really goes, way beyond even the main idea of the movie, with all the time-traveling. In addition, unlike many other movies, every scene seems to last long enough to really give the viewer the exact feeling of freight, sympathy, or just exhiliration that the director or writer really meant by it.",

The action set-pieces are almost as good as those in the first movie, and due to the the fact that this one has a massively higher budget, the action sequences feel even more well-shot. The visual effects look fantastic, and surprisingly still hold up pretty well. But the problem isn't about the action nor the CGI; it's about the situations and the conditions here that couldn't make me worry about the characters as I should.

The extra cash means cooler and more spectacular actionscenes, tons of special-effects(but they look a bit crap now) and better-looking scenery. The movie is almost as good as the original, but this is why I think the original Terminator is a bit better: it doesn`t have the annoying and completely useless brat whose name is John Connor, it was an overall darker movie and Schwarzenegger was more sadistic(which is what The Terminator is all about).

The greatest thriller of all-time!,"A follow up to Cameron's successful ""The Terminator"", this time the Terminator's mission is to protect not terminate. Maybe it should be called ""The Protector""? The bond between the Terminator and the person he's programmed to protect — John Connor (Furlong, in his debut role), the son of the preceding film's target — is actually touching. Only Cameron can pull that off. Linda Hamilton reprises her role as a much darker and tougher Sarah Connor and Earl Boen reprises his role as a more important (and less likable) Dr. Silberman. Is it purposely ironic that the good characters from the first one grow dark in this film, and the dark character from the first one turns good in this film? Regardless of its intention, it works. The T-1000 (Patrick) is the cherry on top (the T-1000 makes ""The Abyss"" look like a student project). 139 minute action/sci-fi/thriller isn't long it's epic!

During parts, and at the end of the movie, people stood up, on their seats, and applauded louder than I have ever heard people applaud since. This is in my mind, at least one of the best 100 movies of all time. It's hard to beat out those older films that AFI for some reason greatly respects, but for their time, they were good too. What I like most about T2 is the sub-plots. The one sub-plot I enjoy the most is the greater awareness and human instinct of the Terminator as he evolves through the film. I'm a film student at Columbia College in Chicago, and I will tell you that this movie is very under appreciated. However, I will always be it's biggest fan, along with my best bro Panty. Here are some of my favorite lines: ""Good morning Dr. Silverman...how's the knee?"" ""He'll live!"" ""Sayyy, that's a nice bike..."" ""I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle."" Haha, man I love this movie more than guys will ever know...",
242,29 May 2004,OriginalMovieBuff21,9," An Excellent Sequel, Arnold's best film","Terminator 2: Judgement Day was a wonderful, sci-fi flick with great special effects. It is not the best sci-fi film but it succeeds in entertaining the audience. I loved Arnold's character in this movie again as the terminator, but this time a good guy who now saves Sarah and John Connor instead of trying to kill Sarah in the 1st one. Arnold was hilarious and once again James Cameron put even more details and a nice script into this movie. I'm glad it did get into the 250 movies of all-time. It's not the greatest film but it is a great 90's film. It's a non-stop entertaining thriller. Go see it!!",
243,7 May 2002,johnnymonsarrat,10, Jon Monsarrat review: Flawless action & intelligent SF.,"""Terminator 2"", while not quite as flawless as the prequel, ""The Terminator"", has something deep to say about life and says it well with deep, touching SF themes. It's quite an intelligent and powerful film without getting too arty.",
244,24 May 2009,Digory,9, I'd like to think of this as the last Terminator in the series.,"James Cameron was right, that was it. Sarah Connor with the help of the Terminator (and Miles Dyson) have destroyed Cyberdyne which changes the future. Judgment Day is inevitable my butt! The only reason they went with that was to capitalize its success, now they've messed it up.",
245,11 May 1999,PIST-OFF,9, Director's cut way way way better.,"Oh woe is the poor souls who have yet to see the director's cut of Terminator 2. I pity thee. Great regular Terminator 2 is, but greater still is the director's cut. There's lots of reasons to love this movie. Arnold gives us the same big gun toting, king of the bullet dimension, rough and tough performance that we all expect from him. James Cameron equals his first Terminator movie in every way and even one ups it in a couple of categories. Like special effects. Along with Jurassic Park this has the greatest special effects of any movie ever. The T-1000 morphs are unbelievable and can be enjoyed despite countless viewings. This time around Arnold's accent isn't as thick so he actually gets a few more speaking lines then just his infamous ""I'll be back!"" A great supporting cast rounds out the picture and good writing and a little humor add on some points. But the director's cut Oh boy. You get a great deal of extra scenes, probably about 25 minutes in all. Plus that includes alot of key special effects scene, a return of Micheal Biehn's character Reese from the first Terminator, a better look at Joe Morton's character's home life and entire plot element. If you're going to purchase this movie I can't stress enough how much you should get the director's cut. It features a second tape with more outtakes, the theatrical trailers, and the alternative ending. Buy the director's cut. You won't be sorry.",
246,19 March 2021,JoelChamp85,10, Unbeatable,"Still to this day it's such an inspiring and remarkable piece of filmmaking. Capturing the 90's nostalgia while introducing the technology of the future, T2 is a pleasure to watch as well as the ""making of"" documentaries. Cameron knows how to make the best sequels, not only by making them bigger and better, but especially by building the story and character arcs exactly how they should be, always pushing the story forward. Who knows how many times I've watched this, or how many times I will again.",

248,30 November 2003,ghostface18,10, The BEST Sci-Fi MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!,"There is only 1 thing I would change about this movie and that is the annoyance of Edward Furlong's voice. But everything else about the movie cancels that out.  The action is FANTASTIC, it has classic lines, SPECTACULAR stunts and SFX, and talk about perfect villians.  Robert Patrick is UNBELEIVEABLE.  Just think, yeah Aliens may be the scaries movie ever and Star Wars is a landmark film, but T2 was the first film to combine CGI and live action.  That's amazing.  And, it was directed by James Cameron and legend has it that he is a perfectionist.  All the Terminators were fantastic, but T2 is CLASSIC.  For any action or classic movie fans, T2 is a MUST OWN!!!!",

Even though the characters overcame the terminator, Judgment Day still beckoned. Nuclear war is coming. Robots will march over the dead and annihilate the living. They are still looking to alter the past to win over the future.",
252,16 March 2020,vjnambu,8, Best terminator film,"I felt the first terminator film pretty average as I found the plot very thin. In first terminator, arnie was a cyborg from future who comes to kill sarah connor.
In judgment day, arnie plays a cyborg from future who comes to protect sarah connor's son john connor from another evil cyborg this time.
When a negative character turns into a positive one then audience will love them like never before. That's the main reason why everyone loves judgment day so much. Arnie is perfect as terminator. Sarah connor this time is in a mental asylum due to the shocking events she had to face in the first terminator. In the first part, she was bit naive and confused but in judgment day she's badass. Edward furlong is quite over aged as john connor. He was a teenager at that time but the character demanded an 8 year old kid. Robert patrick was menacing as the villain.
My favorite scenes were terminator saving john connor in the beginning and terminator and john saving sarah from mental hospital.
But soon after the escape from mental hospital scene film gets slowed down and the ending drags a lot. Also due to the later sequels, the emotional climax reduces its impact.
On the whole, judgment day is a best sequel. The terminator theme from this I always hum around.",

Was the scene deleted from the movie?I think it is a very important scene.Because at that time Linda could destroy the terminator.But she kept him alive(John helped her)since they need him or it to be alive.But this very important scene is vanished.I don't know why it happened,there may be some reasons.I am steel searching the scene.",

262,10 June 2016,ironhorse_iv,9," Terminator is back, yet again! Is this movie worth watching? Yes, indeed!","Continuing the story of the first film, 1984's 'Terminator'; 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' finds a new Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), identical to the one who failed to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the first movie, having now to protect her young son, John Connor (Edward Furlong), from a more advanced cyborg, T-1000 (Robert Patrick) made out of liquid metal. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I love how nightmarish, the opening was, with its heaven and hell motif. The burning playground, with it symbolize the four horsemen of apocalypse made it, very scary. The scenery ends with the T-800 Terminator endoskeleton, symbolizing a chrome figure of death. Wow, intense. Directed by James Cameron, the film is designed in such way that the audience doesn't know which of the time travelers might be the good guy at first. Not only that, T2 conquered one of the biggest challenges in storytelling ever - to completely spin the audience's emotions on the character and turn the most ruthless killer into a sympathetic father figure. Arnold really did great, showing that with Cameron's help. The sunglasses are an important story device in T2. In the first movie they meant to dehumanize T-800 as he takes on more damage, becoming less and less human-like in appearance. In T2, the meaning of the sunglasses has an even deeper meaning as it represent his gradual transformation, from stone-cold killer, to something more human. Because of things like that, the movie carry a strong moral message. The fact that the Terminator was ordered not to kill people becomes a major point of the story as it really deliver the relationship, he has with the young John Conner. Both actors did well in their roles, showing their humanity. Linda Hamilton does the opposite, as she turn her character from a scared, vulnerable waitress into a tough, aggressive machine-like assassin with a muscular physique to match. It's the startling physical transformation that adds a whole other level of psychological credibility to Sarah's character. The way the movie is shot and the story and angles constructed, makes this, a well-executed, action-packed sequel to 'Terminator'. It has a great variety of action set-pieces, car chases and quotable one-liners to make anybody, entertained. Because of things like that, Terminator 2 still remains one of the best action films of all time! Not only that, but it's also one of the most influential sequels in Hollywood blockbuster history. It's nearly a perfect blockbuster movie. However, the movie does have flaws that other critics might overlook, because of nostalgia reasons. First off, the indifferences of Edward Furlong's age between shots. Since, the filming of this film, took some sufficiently time, in many of the scenes, Furlong has indeed visibly aged, despite, the whole film events, happening in a few days. It's clear that he was much younger, when they film the desert scenes, compare to the others. You can see it, when his voice began to break and had to be pitched to one level in post-production. Despite that, Furlong did alright in the role, and wasn't that annoying. Another issue with the film, is how dated, it is. After all, the film's significant date known as ""Judgment Day"", is August 29 1997. It's a bit laughable, seeing that. Even the 1990s references, are starting to lose some traction, with every year that pass. One jarring thing, that some people might notice, is how Terminators don't really act like machines. You know, for killer cyborgs, they really do suck at their jobs. Isn't there, supposed to be a technological singularity, where humans can't compete with the machine? So, why does this movie have scenes, where machines are doing stupid things, like cooking dinner or asking people to call out, names? It doesn't make sense for them, too. Like, how did T-1000, time travel since only living tissue can go through time and he's liquid metal? Despite those nitpicking, the biggest fault of the film is the troublesome and convoluted timeline. While, Terminator 2 is probably the cleanness of all of the films, the movie's ending is a mixed bag for me. I get that, the key message of T2 is that, if events in the past are altered, an already existing future or present can be changed. However, if Judgment Day were prevented, as shown in the film, then there'd shouldn't been no Future War – and no Terminator sent back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, meaning no Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to father, John Connor. I guess, paradoxes can be avoided, by appealing either to the Novikov self-consistency principle or to the notion of branching parallel universes, similar to some type of multiverse theory, but my brain kinda hurt thinking too hard on it. As much as I dislike 2003's 'Terminator 3', as least, the inevitable type ending, made a lot more sense than 'Terminator 2', open-ended climax. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie's open road bittersweet ending. It will make you cry & yes, it is way better than the original altered ending, and 3 times, better than anything else in the previous 'Terminator' films, I saw, but it does leave too much open-questions on how time travel works. Anyways, the great quality of the film, surpass any of the flaws, the film may have. After all, this is the film that made CGI effects seem pleasant. Along, with Robert Patrick wonderful acting, the CGI effects made the T-1000, an iconic villain. Even, the normal practical effects, from Stan Winston was amazing. Terminator 2 even works with wondering haunting theme song from Brad Fiedel. Overall: The movie is masterpiece. The ideas of fate and destiny, determinism and fee will, and the empowerment of the individual and the ability of every person to change the course of the future makes this movie so great. This movie has a lot of depth that few action/science fiction films come compete with, because of that, it's a must-watch.",
263,30 November 2019,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,10, One of the best action films of all time Cameron's masterpiece my personal number 1 favorite,"The best action movie of all time, surpasses the original directed and writen once again by James Cameron and Stars: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick and Edward Furlong. I watched this movie 100 times and I love it so much that I have to talk about it. The effects, the puppetries, the action are great, they are great delivered. It is my personal favorite action film of all time. Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a classic and in my opinion a damn masterpiece along with Aliens (1986) of course. Everything about this film is masterfully executed, the incredible direction, performances, action, writing and effects and music are ALL great and I've never had a problem with any of the subtle humor moments or the fact that Arnold never kills anyone since he is the protector so it makes sense LOL.",
264,1 December 2019,Svenstadt,9, Awesome effort and great fun.,"This movie is very raw and violent and is not for children. The action is solid, and it has some heart-churning moments, from John and Sarah in the car after the escape, to the ending. There are plenty of crying moments. In short, this is a complete action movie, with an ability to segue from one scene to another that hasn't been matched since then. The movie flows well, and the music matches the pace of the movie in lockstep. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because of the few mistakes, which kind of stand out: Arnold saying ""Hasta la Vista, baby,"" only to say next ""We don't have much time,"" was out of place; next mistake was when Arnold says, ""I need a vacation,"" after killing the T-1000, when he didn't learn to say that in the movie. Another mistake, the T-1000 didn't imitate the Arnold Terminator when he walked down to the garage - he could have fooled John and killed him then and there, because he had already touched Arnold during the fight in the galleria. Another bad part was when the orderly at the mental institution licks Sarah Connor's face, this made it into an even more disturbing film! In fact, all the mental hospital scenes were disturbing! Another part I felt was getting bad was after the mental hospital escape, and they start introducing character after character after character!! Luckily, I think they put a cap on the number of characters being introduced. This movie was about 1 step away from being a little too long and too epic and too violent and too menacing. I found the death scene of the T-1000 believable, if not a bit convenient. The deleted scene, where T-1000 malfunctions after being frozen, was a good scene. It seems that nothing other than molten steel could kill that thing.",

267,7 December 2009,LtDT89,10, The...ultimate...action flick,"I consider this movie to be a classic, and for good reason. The CGI is amazing, even for today's standards, and this was released back in '91! The action is explosive, the directing is superb, and the acting was very good, at least believable! Action movies don't require a lot of acting, heck even a coherent plot, but this movie delivers both big time thanks to film master, James Cameron. The plot sets back in '91, where we see the famous ""Ahhnold!"" teleported back in time, not to kill Sarah Conner or even her son, but to protect them, from the vicious, more advanced T-1000! The plot change is enough to make fan excited, because now you know your in a whole new better adventure, and not just more of the same. It's actually very touching to see ""The Terminator"" develop a relationship with young John Conner within the movie as it progresses. I'll admit, I wept a little bit in the end when ""the terminator"" sacrificed himself for the good of man kind, and as he's drowning in the pool of lava, he gives a thumbs up to John for a mission accomplished, seeming that ""the terminator"" actually has a conscience, if not a heart. For me though, I give this movie two thumbs way up! The effects are awesome, especially from the T-1000 aka liquid metal, it has the most memorable action/chase scene I can remember in a movie when T-1000 is chasing little John Conner with a big mack truck. Bottom line, this movie has it all. It's not just a terrific action film, it's a terrific film period!!",

Excellent special effects and great actionscenes make T2 well worth a look for fans of the first, however where as people argue over which Terminator movie is better, I have to say part 1 only because The Terminator accomplished better results with a far lower budget.

Terminator 2 Judgment Day is not half the movie in almost all ways the only place it even comes close to the original is the visual effects, and it surpasses it. Terminator 2 Judgment Day has a lot more action and a lot less story, the plot is very flawed and it is made even worse by the wooden dialogue and the bad characters. The acting is just horrible, Arnold Schwarzenegger or however you spell it is just horrible. as is Linda Hamilton. The kid is okay but can't save the film. The direction is very good, but Cameron has done much better before with Titanic and the original Terminator. The visual effects are amazing for the time and good for today although at moments it is very easy to tell when somethings fake. Just watch the original and than if you like it this may be worth looking into.",
283,6 April 2020,krational66,8, The sequel is better.,"The first movie in the history is classic enough, and the sequel can surpass the first movie. John connor teleports Reese into the past in terminator 1; Reese and Sarah connor gave birth to John connor, forming a closed loop. The same is true of terminator 2, where skynet transported the t-800 into the past to give humans the terminator chip that inspired skynet's creation. So they're going to find miles dyson and break the cycle. Miles dyson was responsible for inventing skynet and indirectly destroying the world in the parallel universe, where he became a hero protecting humanity at the cost of life. John connor's change of attitude towards his mother is also striking. He always thought his mother was crazy and a loser. Until one day, he found that everything his mother said was true. Skynet made the t-800's central processing unit read-only, preventing it from generating thoughts. Such a soulless killer is willing to end himself in exchange for world peace. Who says machines can't be human? The thumbs-up shot in the flames is one of the most powerful moments in film history.",

The action is brilliant it had an excellent plot to it and good character development. This is the best movie of the Terminator series no doubt. Every thing about it is really cool. James Cameron really did do a good job in making this film,

This means that it is NOT destroyed along with the laboratory arm and micro chip after the destruction of the T1000, and thus, when the Terminator is lowered into the molten iron, there is STILL a robot arm in existence. The arm is bound to be found by scientists like Dyson who will eventually replicate it. This just shows that you can't change the future by changing the past. World War III is bound to happen but hopefully only in the Terminator universe. I don't know if this has been commented on before but going through the goofs I couldn't find any comments relating to this.",
286,7 August 2010,gchild94,10, Always makes me cry,I was 13 when this movie came out and as a 13 year old lad I loved this movie. I hadn't seen it in years and just watched it again. I have to say it just keeps getting better. The visual effects still look impressive all these years later and the soundtrack is amazing. The T-1000 is probably one of the best baddies in a movie ever. It is totally relentless in it's attempts to kill John Connor and it's up to the older model Terminator (Arnie) to protect John at all costs. There's nothing about the movie I don't like and that's all thanks to James Cameron. I think it's amazing that Arnie was able to go from uber-villain in the original Terminator to uber-hero in the sequel whilst playing exactly the same character basically. I realise that he's a robot but I don't think anyone else could've played that part and Arnie excels here. As a now 32 year old man I know I'm supposed to be all tough and hardened but the ending ALWAYS makes me cry and I'm not ashamed about it. Totally amazing.,

301,28 June 2004,nicklavigne,10," The Best Sequel Ever Made! 9,5/10","After the release of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", we all knew James Cameron was the best director for sequels. He had already proved that a sequel could surpass the original with ""Aliens"", but with this one, he took it to a whole new level. The story of the 1984 hit thriller ""The Terminator"" is about a cyborg machine sent back through time to kill the future-mother of a military leader who will supposedly, take mankind to victory against the machines in an upcoming war. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" takes us about 13 years later. Sarah Connor is now in a mental institution after trying to blow up Cyberdyne. Her now-born-son, John Connor lives with his foster parents. But when a terminator called T-1000 comes to kill John, his only hope lies with the same terminator that once tried to kill his mother. Together, they will help Sarah to escape from the mental institution, destroy Cyberdyne to avoid judgment day and fight a metal-liquid made terminator, that seems invincible. What is so great with this movie is two things: the special effects and the script. James Cameron truly wrote a script superior to the original ad added more depth to the story. The special effects by Stan Winston are truly remarkable. They introduced CGI Animation to the world, long before ",

Instead of the terminator blasting away at everyone in sight, he shoots them in the leg! The first film was original, shocking, disturbing and carried a powerful emotional charge. The dream of Kyle Reese, the man sent to protect Sarah Connor, is powerfully disturbing - a vision of the future in which mankind is being hunted to extinction, yet manages to just about hold on. In Terminator 2 we have the same scene - this  time it is Sarah Connor dreaming, and her dream is a clichéd one: the atom bomb dropping. A vision we long ago became familiar with and so holds no resonance at all. That lack of imagination and originality runs throughout this tired film. The fight in the first film was between a passionate human being (a man who feels pain, fear and love) and a remorseless cyborg. The end, in which a human uses cunning and ingenuity to destroy the machine, and uses another machine to do that, is satisfactory. In this limp re-make it is cyborg versus cyborg, and humans are on the side-lines. We are not engaged - indeed, it is like watching a computer game: empty and meaningless.",

However, my God, the dialogue is just bad, especially any dialogue by John Conner. Despite this major flaw, T2 is certainly worthy of its acclaim.",
332,14 September 2006,Schaffino2,9, The best sequel ever made ever and a hell of a debut for a good actor named Furlong,"Termionmator 2 is the best sequel ever made ever. Not only for the action move genre but of all time. Arnold is back in prime form as the good guy Terminator. Wicth I prefer 2 his ever roll in the first movie. Linda Hamelton is a powerhouse. Th evil Terminator is also awesome. But, Ther was this kid named Edward in this movie who played extremely well. Edward Furlong made the best debut of an actor I have ever seen and now he is a star and one of my favorite actors. He is the man. The Best young almost child actor I have ever seen. So he played the roll of a kid very well. He was also important to Arnolds interaction with humans. . This sequel crushes all the other sequels before it and after it. Not to mention The action was awesome, awesome, awesome.",

From the first time I witnessed the fast paced action, high powered weaponry and the the T-1000 emerging from explosions and floors, I was immediately hooked. I don't think there's any aspect of this film that I don't like, it really has a great feel of humanity's struggle against the creation of Skynet which will be responsible for the loss of so much life.",

I grew up watching action movies like this, james bond, fifth element etc... Nothing has changed about this movie since I was 4. It's still and always will be my favourite movie. In some of my other reviews I also write that those movies are my favourite. But sometimes I don't mean it. If not my favourite, it is definitely one of my favourites. It was my favourite movie as a kid, and it still is now (i'm 13 so i'm still kinda a kid LOL). I have never seen a more perfect movie in every aspect. It is action-packed and is full of excitement. The script is brilliant. The acting is brilliant. Overall the whole movie is brilliant.",
340,17 January 2004,Aaron1375,9, The sweeping epic of the series.,"This terminator movie is the big one of the three; by big I mean the longest one, the one that was the epic blockbuster.  I like all three the same though.  This one is the biggest of the bunch and has many great special effects; this one also though has a couple of boring spots in it.  The other two have better flow while this one stops here and there.  Still though there are great action scenes, though nothing as good as the chase in part three.  It also has a cool villain in the T-1000, a terminator that was very tough to kill.  I say it was a lot more durable than the T-X in part three even if it couldn't do some of the stuff it could.  Arnold is of course great in the one role that is perfect for him and Linda Hamilton is good as well.  Furlong is okay, but he can get on your nerves so I am glad he didn't come back for part three.  This one has it all and is the grandest of the bunch as far as scope, Cameron was trying for a big budget, and big event movie and he succeeded.",

Firstly the plot continuation of the brilliant part 1 takes off supurbly,its an wasy going sequel,but much much more than that. Its a top notch action film and Arnold Shwarznegger and Linda Hamilton are back,but this time their is a newbie,its John Conner (Edward Ferlong),i liked his character,many people disliked him,he did a good job,but he was kind of exaggerated and stereotyped as a troublesome teenager.Its been a long while since ive seen the film,yet i remember it so well.Its a movie that youll never forget,with memorable performances and great special effects,this was the greatest film of the 20th century.I loved it.",

343,27 October 2003,eamon-hennedy,10, One of the finest sequels ever made.,"From beginning to end this is a fantastic film, a sequel that truly betters what was really considered to be a film that couldn't be bettered. James Cameron has really increased everything here. Budget, special effects as well as the stakes in his fictional universe. Whereas Sarah, the mother, was the target,  now it's John himself and the story that takes place is superb showing that Cameron truly is the master of the Hollywood blockbuster, a writer/director who can mix big budget thrills and spills with brilliant character drama, which he does so exceedingly well here and this is not seen better than when we see the character development of the Terminator itself which stands as the best part of the film, apart from the action sequences that is.

I first saw it just a few days after its release and liked it so much that I went to see it again and again - and again! In other words, I saw it four times in a movie theater! As good as the original Terminator was (and still is), Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of those movie sequels that outdoes the original. It has great special effects, and Arnold Schawarzenegger is excellent as the Terminator. Robert Patrick did a fine job as the T-1000, a terminator programmed to seek and do away with John Connor (brilliantly played by Edward Furlong). Of course, Linda Hamilton reprised the role of John's mother, Sarah Connor. The film won some Oscar awards, including one for the visual effects, and deservedly so.",

Here, set almost 10 years after the events of the original Terminator movie, an evil cyborg called the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) is sent to the present through time to terminate future human resistance leader John Connor (Edward Furlong). However, another Terminator (Schwarzenegger) is also sent back through time to protect John and mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from T-1000's grips.

James Cameron, as director of the first two cinematic installments of the Terminator franchise, admits how the focal ideas of this tale are gravitating towards the works of author Harlan Ellison, who delivered numerous stories for the sci-fi series Outer Limits, back in 1963. James Cameron was 13 then, and this television program surely must have given him quite a few retina stigmas and a lot of quality fiction to chew on. After all, quality science-fiction really should be able to offer you a fictional language and a collection of ideas you find intriguing and entertaining at the same time, and this exactly is what the Terminator movie was doing, - in fact, does still - back in-, and from- 1984.",

There are of course the more obvious fields in which this film excels, like mind-blowing special effects (especially for the time when it came out) and acting at its best (thanks Linda!), but there is so much more to it! A unique, original and very becoming soundtrack, cinematography that makes every still a picture to be hung in a living room and James Camerons virtually unmatched direction. All these factors combined would make a fantastic movie alone, but this one's got more: Heart, love and an unforgettable story. To see that so much emotion, reason and art can be expressed through a movie of the SciFi/Action genre that is stunning and entertaining at the same time - this is the ultimate joy of being into the movies.",

I just finished watching this movie for the 11th time and it still amazes me. The story is great, Arnold is at his best, and the effects blow me away; this is one of the best sequels ever, heck it's one of the best sci-fi films ever. Yes the Matrix is good and visually amazing, but it doesn't have what T2 has. The original Star Wars films are my favorite sci-fi films, but Terminator 2: Judgement Day, is my second favorite film in this genre. This is a definite film for any DVD collection, it looks fantastic, and if you can, buy the special edition. It has a newly re cut version of the film adding sixteen minutes onto the original film, which do not diminish the quality of the film, but rather enhance it.

Not only is it visualy more sophisticated and more realistic in its action sequences but it also has a unique quality, that being its storyline.

This was arnold's best movie although he has had other movies that good. The same goes for Cameron. Titanic and avatar might have been decent movies that made tons more money but I would still choose T2 over them. Some of the fx are a bit dated but the t1000 effects still match up to modern movies. This movie was vastly superior to T3 and T4. The last two terminator movies were all style and very little substance whereas T2 had the right blend of action and wit. T2 had a heart and brain in there somewhere. T2 does have a few minor flaws. I thought that edward furlong was a bit wooden in places (only slightly) but then again this was his first time to act. The story also slumped a slight bit in the middle. Definitely a movie to be recommended",

The action in the movie was great, it kept me on the edge of my seat. The guy who plays the mean robot is really convincing. I actually had a nightmare about him. I think Edward Ferlong was really great as well. Arnold was perfect for his role. The words ""asta lavesta baby"" and ""I'll be back"" will be quoted for ever.

374,5 July 2007,Tumey,8," Many faults, but very enjoyable","The twist in the sequel to the frankly quite good sci-fi actioner The Terminator is that this time, Arnold Schwarzenegger is on our side, with Johnny Cash's dad / Sopranos debt ower Robert Patrick on the other. The Terminator is here to save John Connor, and, consequently, Linda Hamilton, from the new T-1000 which, through some very impressive special effects can change into a liquid, among other things. Edward Furlong, he who could act in American History X, does not do so well here, with his character of John Connor rather annoying. An irritating voice-over from Hamilton is also peculiarly brought in halfway through that seems out of place as well, while Arnie is his usual self. Despite all this however, the sheer scale of the special effects of the action sequences is more than enough to make the film passable, with many scenes that linger in the memory. Even with some spelt-out 'sub'texts, this is almost the perfect action film. 4 / 5",

Everything, from the cinematography, to the score, the action, the effects, the script, the writing, it's a damn near perfect movie. Arnold absolutely kills it as the Terminator in both T1 and T2, and was perfect in both movies as said character. Also, Robert Patrick, Edward Furlong, and Linda Hamilton are all fantastic in their roles. I feel like the first Terminator was great as both an action and horror movie.

His action timing and the quote-'Astala Vistala baby' will haunt u for years.Furlong and Hamilton also did a fairly good job but still Arnold was undoubtedly the main attraction. Robert Patrick's character may even be called the greatest villain of all time because T-1000 was as deadly as an atom bomb. And last of all James Cameron took the terminator franchise to a milestone after the fairly good part 1(The Terminator in 1984).

I prefer the Theatrical version over the Special Edition because the additions are so overwhelming that you think you have a film of tremendous scale that it is harder to watch and enjoy. The acting is wonderful, the story is insanely involving, the special effects are mind-boggling. James Cameron is a flat-uot filmmaking genius. Bravo! This film is one of few in the '90s that is going to last generations.",

I mean, Sarah's dream, in which Kyle visits her... Linda Hamilton is simply gorgeous, but more important, the whole scene is just fabulous. The scene in which the T1000 is on the phone with Jonh (who thinks he's talking to his foster parents) and then finds out the dog's name is Max instead of Wolfie). Then there's the scene where she wants to destroy the terminator's chip. And the scene at the end where we see an adult John with his daughter and mother at the playground. Linda looks great as a grandmother, and IF James Cameron would have kept it at the end, probably no one would have made that horrible T3 movie...

406,9 February 2005,eldergod-1,9, A stunning scifi epic.,"""Terminator 2: The Judgment Day"" is without a doubt the best scifi action ever made. With great script, jaw-dropping visual effects and stunning action, it entertains and in the same time chills the viewers. The story is set several years after the events of the original. Sarah Connor is considered mad and is in hospital, while her son, John is a cocky pre-teen, who hates his step-parents and lives mainly in the streets. Unfortunately for him, from the future comes a new and deadly Terminator of liquid metal - an unstoppable killing machine, which can not be hurt. Of course, a new protector is sent - this time he is the villain from the first movie, or at least a Terminator from the same model. He must save John from the liquid assassin. Which is impossible. The movie grabs you from the start and is great to the finish. The actors are excellent - not only veterans Arnold Swartzenegger and Linda Hamilton, but also Robert Patrick and Eddie Furlong. The story is epic in scale and action-packed, and the visual effects are still among the best in the genre, even today. In conclusion - the greatest action scifi ever made.",

Whereas Terminator 2, was a dark, horrific, brutal film, T2 is more about the theme of the future of humanity in a nuclear era. Blessed with a huge budget and a superb script Cameron successfully turns the tables on Arnie's character and Sarah Connor's developing relationship with the Terminator. Also effective is John Connor's development into the leader he becomes in the future during the film. I'm one of the few that actually prefer the first one over this one. To me, the original Terminator was scarier and creepier. The thought of an unstoppable killing machine on your trail with the only human (yet very resourceful) Kyle Reese to protect you was a terrifying one. It was more of sci-fi meets horror and it was extremely effective in what it set out to do. The sequel is more of a blockbuster sci-fi action movie that does what it sets out to do just as effectively, so which one you prefer probably depends on what genre you prefer your Terminator in.",
416,15 February 2021,judemcrobbie,10, Easily the best Terminator Movie.,"This movie is head and shoulders above the first and don't get me started on the ones after.
This is arguably the best sequel of all time, up there with Back to the Future II, The Godfather: Part II and The Dark Knight. This is because stays true to the original but expands on the concepts and spirit laced out by the first one. It is also the perfect sequel because it adds onto the original with ideas compatible with original.
Usually one of my main pet peeves with movies is 'Themes don't make movies'. But this movie manages to integrate them so seamlessly into the movie it gets you thinking. These themes come thick and fast:
Firstly, the terminators are a whole extended metaphor for nuclear missiles and the mutually assured destruction from the Cold War. This is shown how when they fight, everyone loses. This is through the setting and people getting destroyed.
Furthermore with the Cold War analogy, the terminators could be the countries involved (Russia and America). Moreover, Sarah and John Connor are meant to represent us, the average people in this world. This is also because of how they are ultimately the ones who lose, or at least get hurt because of the terminators, the countries, fighting.
Secondly, the idea of if anyone is truly evil and irredeemable. This is shown from the how, even though its off screen, The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) goes from this truly evil machine to a good machine trying his hardest to empathise with humans. I do slightly wish this was done on screen, and yes they did play with it a bit when Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) first sees him. This makes us think of the moral ambiguity presented by the movie.
One of the most iconic lines in the movie, and possibly cinema, is the 'I know now why you cry'. This line by itself is endlessly quotable but also it os brilliantly brought up to through the movie. This is right from the start when The Terminator says 'What's wrong with your eyes?' And 'Why do you cry?'. This line has the ultimate set up and effect on us. Throughout the movie The Terminator's arc is that of finding humanity. This line sums that arc in he has found out what it means to be human, but there's never going to bee anything to be able to be human except a human. It's really rather beautiful when you think about it.
Thirdly, The idea of free will and destiny. This one is not so subtly embedded into the movie as they talk about it throughout but James Cameron's (The Director, not a character) direction throughout is so sublime and the writing is astonishingly good that it doesn't deal forced, nor too subtle.
This movie also contains some of the most artistic little. Details. This is from how Sarah Connor is unusually muscly, letting her beat men in strength and also showing how she is preparing for the future to much more.
The cast is not the best, I don't think anyone will get annoyed at that, but the production team make it so that each actor can play to their strengths and avoid their weaknesses:
Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Terminator) is awesome. He may not be the best actor, but Terminator 2 utilises him to the best of everyone's ability. The Terminator doesn't say much except one liners, this works perfectly for Schwarzenegger as his one liner delivery is second to none and his body acting is just fine for the stiff machine he is playing.
Edward Furlong (John Connor) in this movie has not quite got the ability he haas when he's older, but nonetheless he makes good work of the script given to him. He may not give the best delivery on some of the lines but he was 13, what do you expect?
Linda Hamilton (Sarah Connor) is easily the best of the trio. She basically plays 2 character; the sweet and caring mother and the weapon of a woman. These are both natural character progressions from the original and she plays them beautifully. She embodies the badass side, however she does struggle with the emotions sometimes, but I definitely couldn't do better.
The complex and layered movie this turned out to be is what it easily the best in the franchise. Yes, this movie being made does definitely make the original less powerful as it blatantly retcons the idea of them only being able to send one back in time, but by the end I guarantee you will not care.",

418,10 March 2007,drystyx,1, Nothing likable about this movie at all,"It's hard to find nothing to like about a movie, but there's nothing good about this one. The first movie was bad enough, and it served as an excuse for bullies to try to invite people over and try to force them to watch it. I'm not sure what they get out of it. I just know they do it. The films are horribly written movies about machines coming back from the future to destroy a guy who is supposed to be all that and a box of cracker jacks. He isn't. In this movie, he's a brat to beat all brats, even for a kid. You just hope he gets killed and the movie ends. None of the characters are likable. The idea of time travel to change the future could be done better than in this movie series by a two year old kid. There's a lot of noise that passes for action, but the action is shot in such a way that you don't really know what's going on. This is how not to make a movie. Too bad you can't vote negative numbers for junk like this. If you haven't seen it, believe me, you aren't missing a thing.",

423,4 August 2018,shakercoola,7, Spectacular special effects-laden sci-fi action,"An American sci-fi thriller; The second film in the Terminator franchise used CGI technology to great effect along with marvellous stunts and other visual effects to make it a 'best in class' genre film.
The film has an interesting story - an intriguing hero, a fierce heroine, and a young boy who is played with energy - but it is a repeat premise of The Terminator (1984). Science paradoxes are rife - a higher intelligence in the future is the very end product of its time travelling mission, and it is implausible that it would not deduce in a femtosecond that its intent is futile logic. That aside, it has a convincing central performance from its star once again, and stirring support from Linda Hamilton. Robert Patrick gives a menacing portrayal of the advanced machine out to stop the prevention of 'Judgment Day'. The pacing is good with some thought provoking narrative tight to the storyline which produces comical material. It has One of the few false notes is that the story doesn't produce one single character to root for.
There are the usual car chases, explosions and fight scenes, all well done in the big set pieces, but it is a film most memorable for the way the movie envisions nanorobotics. Since technology has emerged in recent years able to mimic the effect, in a rudimentary way, it makes Director James Cameron's vision remarkable.
Tension doesn't run quite as high as in the first film, where Arnold Schwarzenegger excelled in convincing us of a terrifying force, a diabolical killing machine seemingly incapable of being destroyed, but it is in the special effects that this film soars to realise the vision of a high technology future and an epic story of man vs thinking machine.",

T2 is one of those films where you want it to keep on going because it is that good, and you start to feel bad when you know it's almost over.

AND this was the highest budgeted movie to date...as we continue to look back at JC's record, he tends to demand these outlandish requirements and backing and yet always pulls it off. Since I have recently seen Avatar (also created by the master), I was fortunate enough to read an article that stated, in short, that Cameron spent the better part of 2 months in a hotel across from the Twentieth Century Fox lot in preparation for the Avatar opening and that Fox basically just handed him the keys as he was there day and night in genius mode.

Besides the special effects, and they are great, is the sheer terror and hopelessness the main characters are in. How do you stop a relentless, ruthless killing machine? Linda Hamilton was superb in T2.(I fell in love with that body!) She was almost as unstoppable as the machine in her pursuit of saving her son and mankind. I'm not a fan of your basic Sci-fi special effects. Snarling aliens drooling slime all over their victims, and gross mutant alien-babies popping out of humans don't thrill me. But it T2, Cameron does it best, it's more believable. With technology these things could happen. I was blown out of my seat with the EXTREME special effects, and chase scenes. This is the best action movie I have ever seen, BY FAR! If this movie doesn't blow you away, you better check your pulse rate. My recommendations? See it on a big screen and crank up the volume.",

The effects are well integrated into the plot, and the behavior of the robot, as it develops un understanding of its own capabilities is well thought out.

I have to say, i absolutely love the original Terminator movie. Everything about it is awesome. Some people seem to think that this film was better than the original. It is great without a doubt, but i still have always preferred the original. Probably because it was the original idea, and i found Arnold a lot cooler and more intimidating in the first one. Cameron tried to make Arnold look a lot cooler in this film, when the film opens up with him in the bar, and he has his new sticky- up hair cut which looks awesome. But, he didn't look half as big and intimidating as he was in the first one. One good thing about this film is that it was filmed on much bigger budget than the first film, and the new Terminators were a lot more up to date with technology than the first one, In the first one it was just a powerful machine inside a mans human tissue. The same includes with Arnold in this one, in this film, he is the protector, not Terminator. But still in a Terminator form. This film is definitely worth seeing if you love the first film, i'm one of few who prefer the first one, thats just my opinion, i have seen the first one so many times and is a childhood classic of mine. But a lot of people tend to think this film is better.",

It's better than the first and third but if you have never seen any terminator movies, you should watch the first. This movie won special effects of 1991 but it deserves more. Arnolds acting has improved from the first. You should get the extreme DVD, it is extended with extra scenes that are quite important (in my opinion). This movie is also the most lightened up of the three (mostly due to john Connor's sense of humor). Like all terminator movies, the bad guy has more advantages.

One is that the ""tough-chick"" act by Hamilton runs a little dry by the end of the movie.  Also, there isn't really anyone to root for in this one (unlike pulling for Hamilton in the original).  As a fan of the original, it was nice to see a a sequel with a purpose.  It is obvious that T2 was made for a specific reason and not to just bleed money from the fans of the 1st movie (like most sequels).

Both project expansive, extraordinary visions (Spielberg seems more caught up in character while Cameron, equally as invested, is a little more interested in expansive special effects) that while thrilling on an overall scale are often a bit too sentimental which takes away from the overall film. This is not the case with the timelessly bombastic Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Out of all of Cameron's films, the emotional aspect here is really excellent because it's subtle. A great example of this emotional subtlety is the crying scene where Arnie asks a young Edward Furlong what's wrong with his eyes. Classic. The more obvious and over-the-top scenes of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) escaping a creepy treatment center are well-acted too, devoid of sentimental music. Just gritty, and unfortunate, reality here. On top of this emotional subtlety comes the action, so when the scenes intended to make the tears start rolling start rolling, the tears genuinely can start rolling. 10/10.",

471,15 December 2014,Rickting,9," ""I'll Be Back."" Good!","The Terminator is a fine film, although it feels relatively small at times. However, Terminator 2 Judgement Day completely expands the story and James Cameron crafts one of the best sequels ever made. Many years after the first film Sarah Connor is in an asylum and her son has been put into care. A far more advanced cyborg comes back to kill John Connor, while an reprogrammed terminator from the first film comes back to save John and Sarah. With a much higher budget and bigger scope, this certainly does what a sequel is meant to do. James Cameron is a director I admire but not someone who's films I automatically go and see as his films can feel somewhat cold, but this doesn't waste a dollar of its $100 million budget. James Cameron's direction offers mind blowing visuals and exhilarating action spectacle throughout, as the endlessly entertaining action scenes and surprisingly deep script leave most other sequels in the gutter. The action sequences sometimes seem to devolve as they go along, and John Connor is an annoying child sidekick, but the film achieves most of its goals in stunning style.",

473,21 February 2002,amol_gh,10, The Greatest & the Best Movie Of All Time.,"As they say ... Nothing gets Bigger and Better than this. (For Plot Outline please read the IMDB Plot.) It has always been hard to beat the deadly combination of Arnold Schwarzenegger + James Cameron. Add to that... (i)a perfect flawless script. (ii)excellent direction by one of the greatest directors. (iii)a perfectly assembled cast who give great performances. (iv)hard-core emotions which are firmly in contact with the ground reality. (v)state-of-the-art visual and sound effects (vi)a high production cost....and you get a great MASTERPIECE.(though the last two factors are not the necessary for a movie to be a classic.)(Also I don't usually use the Highlighted Word for any movie other than for one of my personal Top 25 movies of All Time.Impossible to reduce the list to Top 10.) But to be honest, no other movie of Mr.Arnie, the former multiple Mr.Universe,Mr.World,Mr.Germany,Mr.Olympia,Mr.Europe,Mr.this and Mr.that has been a near perfect movie as this one other than the great Kindergarten Cop which is better than every other movie of Schwarzenegger.( Some Others mentionable only for Action and some Comedy such as:Conan the Barbarian(1982);True Lies(1994)(Remember the '9/11' attacks?);Predator(1987);Twins(1988);Total Recall(1990)and the 'more-genuinely-acted' End Of Days(1999)). If any critic/fan/judging person says that this is the greatest action movie of all time than he is partly right.Because there are lots of emotions and philosophical realities in this movie as well. As one the Arnie's famous one-liner says:""It's in your(humans') nature to destroy to yourselves(themselves)."" Nothing is so ironical reality as this one when it comes to humans. Also this one:""I do not know why you(humans) cry but that is something I(cyborgs) can never do."" This explains that if Machines can understand us why  can't we homo-sapiens, who are so cruel and blood thirsty inspite of the fact that nature has gifted us with emotions so that we express our joys,griefs and also guide others?And as this one-liner of Schwarzenegger goes :""..."".That's enough,its better if those reading this comments who haven't watch this movie go and watch it NOW. As far as the characters are concerned, Linda Hamilton has been very fluent, smooth and sophisticated in the role of Sarah, expressing beautifully the 'motherly-love' in her for her child John,whose life is in danger(""You are too important, John!"").Edward Furlong was too good as the vulnerable John in whose hands lie the protection of the future of humans. Also Robert Patrick was great as the mean and the menacing T-1000 who will never ever say 'die' until he has completed his job of destruction.(""Your foster parents are dead."") As for Arnold Schwarzenegger(""Trust me."")he could never have been cast in any other movie as perfectly as the stone-faced Terminator(a role tailor made for him), a tough cyborg made of metallic exoskeleton and endoskeleton made of flesh,muscles and blood and nerves but with a CPU instead of a cerebrum who will stop at nothing to protect John.(even with only a single hand.) James Cameron(Terminator,The(1984);Aliens(1986);Abyss,The(1989);True Lies(1994);Titanic(1997)) as always has an ace in his hands.The above films have been milestones for other movies to follow. The Action in this movie is mind blowing considering the huge production cost.(Ofcourse I'm a Terminator."") The Visual and Sound Effects(especially the haunting background scores) are trully great.(They deserved the Oscars they won.) This movie is one of my personal Top 25 Most Favourite Movies along with Life Is Beautiful(1997);Unbreakable(2000);Sixth Sense,The(1999);Taxi Driver(1976);M*A*S*H(1970);Patch Adams(1998);Great Dictator,The(1940),Dog Day Afternoon(1975)and many more. If Arnie's upcoming'Terminator 3'(and who else?)and James Cameron's 'True lies 2'(again Arnie and who else?)are even quarter as good as their prequels I'm going to watch them and advise others to watch(But please watch all the prequels first.)to have an out-of-the-world experience.",

James Cameron has given us at least two of th greatest action movies this gem and Aliens. Also look at the fact that both of these are sequels to very well liked almost horror movies. Cameron knows where to put the camera and knows how to make the action work. Now without even touching the surface look at the acting Arnold who also did the first Terminator in 84 and has aged amazingly well hell even looks better and they have flipped the script to turn what Sara conner fears most into what she needs to stay alive.

However, the T-1000 is NOT covered in living tissue - he is made out of a liquid metal that only looks like living tissue Therefore, the T-1000 technically should not have been able to go through the time transporter. 2. The computer that the T-1000 reads in the police car (at the beginning of the film) reads that John is 10 years old and was born in  1985. This means that the movie would have to take place in 1995 ( 2 years before Judgement Day). Yet, Arnold claims in the car, (while driving towards Mexico) that Judgement Day would happen in 3 years, just after the Skynet funding bill is passed by congress. Finally the visual effects of the film were AMAZING!!!",

The ironic part about this is that the graphics are waaaaaaaay ahead of 1991's time, and I cannot tell you how many times I watched the part where T-1000 is chasing John Connor on the motorcycle.

From a very young age she starts to instruct him about what's coming and what he will have to be. John has no father now. And Sarah wants him not only to be a man, but a very capable one.

Some examples of the drama are: Sarah reluctantly excepting the Terminator as a partner and Sarah's struggle with what she knows the future will bring.

The relationship between John (Edward Furlong) and T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) for me was one of the even bright spots outside of the brilliantly choreographed actions scenes, relentless chases and Linda Hamilton's Sarah still wary of the motives from her new ally.

If you take in mind that the movie was made in 1991, and if you look at the way special effects have been developed since, you have to admit that this movie was certainly ground-breaking in those terms. I still watch it every now and then, and I find it just as enjoyable as the first time I saw it.

He was busy filming other projects, and was also not ready to take on a sequel, because he understood that his ideas would be difficult to implement with the help of computer technology in the mid-1980s.

Sorry, but Robert Patrick will never be menacing as Arnold was. Then it came to the story of how Sky Net was created. Oh dear. Big mistake. How can a computer be created from the brain chip of a Terminator it sent back in time??? A paradox. Hate it when a Director overlooks something as important as this.

517,30 July 2017,tomsters,5, predictable and clichéd,"mediocre sequel. question; who's fault is that? answer; its the audience and the producers who want to make money from them more then to entertain them with originality and entertainment. this was more of a remake than a sequel. while i'm in the audience, i kept hearing the neanderthals either complaining certain stunts weren't repeated or cheering when stunts were repeated. so when you cater to the lowest common denominator, you cant make art, you only make a two hour commercial. the first was fairly original with a somewhat clichéd ending. the time travel part was cool but its not that hard to keep to the rules of science of physics. movies are crap when obvious rules are broken and sequels are worse when they ignore their own history. IE, flesh or flesh covered only, so how did the liquid robot pass through the time portal? the over used cliché of the doctor not believing the patient. that scene should have been first, t2 lands outside the hospital, rescues Sara, shocks the doc who was berating her about t2 and we all laugh. then together they find the punk kid who is to save the world. the ending narrative was good about its all new, creating a new time line without a paradox. that is until the sequels ruined that and got more commercially stupid. i do so hope the franchise ends with Sara Connor riding her scooter to work as the last scene of the last movie as the time paradox closes around them. why? because they couldn't come up with a better idea than the tired one of technology from our own future. how does that ever work? we are not smart enough now to invent what we did in the future so it couldn't ever exist then. does that mean Einstein ensured are technological history by sending the wheel back in time to the neanderthals such as the ones cheering in this audience? why do movie makers think we are stupid and/or don't care that we can actually understand more than a grade 3 level of logic. maybe pandering to the lower classes makes money, but so does being original or t1 wouldn't have been so successful and then there wouldn't be any sequels. as with many badly thought out sequels, the performances were good. its not their fault what lines were given to them. if not for the acting, i would have walked out of the theater. the sfx and action were good, except for the truck jumping into the canal and still keeps going and then is able to out accelerate a very agile dirt bike. maybe the truck should have been part of the liquid robot too.",

Everyone praises T2 for being one of the rare sequels to outdo the original. Actually it just tries way too hard to outdo the first and completely loses the effective simplicity which made the original great. T2 strives to be a 'perfect Hollywood Blockbuster' by blending thought provoking sci-fi concepts and strong character drama with high budget special effects, shoot 'em up action, and lots of comic relief. Unfortunately the end result is nothing more than a McDonalds Big Mac... It looks nice and indulges your craving but ultimately is filled with lots of artificial ingredients and cheese that doesn't sit well long term.

I'm not happy. It is a taste thing (I hated Terminator II), but actually much more of a big picture thing. Franchises changed the Industry: Avengers, Infinity War, Black Panther, Captain America, Black Widow, Walt Disney Studios. Hollywood studios have always been a business, but it's in the last few years, where they have become part of big conglomerates, that have shareholders and must answer to Wall Street, that the studios have become risk averse to the point of only putting money behind big films. Nowadays, the studios only do award-baiting, artsy films, or 200 million dollar blockbusters.

No man never... except this movie OK lets start: This a masterpiece i felt every emotion in here the adrenaline when Arnie rescues John in the truck chase all that adrenaline when he steps in front of the T-1000's truck just a few inches before the truck hits the wall and Arnie stretches his arm, grabs John and passes to its motorcycle is the best adrenaline scene i've ever seen Another scene the merged my emotions definitely when Arnie steps like a bad A(pip!) with the mini gun that scene is awesome!!! Also i felt like i was watching a football game screaming cheering ""Go Arnie GO! Come'on!"" when he says ""ill be back"" and walks being hit by the SWAT team shooting at him (i honestly was saying ""no come'on Arnie keep moving you can do it go go go come'on please don't give up) Then i honestly get angry when the T-1000 gives a smack to Arnie in the steel mill and impales him with the crowbar i said ""NOOO!!!!!

John Connor was Edward Furlong- it was a real pity that he was so crazy and didn't go on in his career because he is and will a great actor. The feeling about life is strongest that the first part, because in this occasion the own terminator learns that it can't kill whoever it wants because that produces pain and regret and it understands that a machine can replace a human for a lot of things but no to feel sensations. And a world without sensation isn't it a world, despite of, nowadays we are a little bit more insensitive. I was only 7 years when i saw this movie ( and i saw this part before the first). I understood that the life is so valuable. The role of Miles B. Dyson (Joe Morton) is special for this reason: in a low minutes he notices that is responsible for a lot of deaths for his own develops. He was so happy and so carried away about his job that he never thought about what could produce if the machines someday take control of everything.

539,17 May 2007,zbyszek111,10, A Very Moving Experience,This is my favourite film of all time. I am 25 years old. I clearly remember when I saw it when I was 10 years old and the thing that immediately struck me even though I was only 10 years old was how artistic and brilliantly directed it was. The main reason James Cameron made this masterpiece was not because he only wanted to make money. All the greatest movies of all time deal with an important issue about humanity and T2 is no exception. It deals with how humanity has a tendency to destroy itself. This is a very important universal issue and it affects each of us when we turn on the TV and hear news about various wars happening around the world. This masterpiece works on so many levels that it's truly amazing. It contains some of the best visual effects and action scenes ever put on film. It is a thrill ride from beginning to end and the great character interaction and drama never stops. During each action scene you always feel that the characters are fighting for the fate of humanity. By far James Cameron's best film and that is saying a lot. It's much more emotional and dramatic than Cameron's overrated and disappointing Titanic. T2 clearly shows that James Cameron is most creative and artistic when he is making an Action/Sci-fi film. Anybody no matter what age will consider this a great film. It only gets better with time and I love it now even more than when I was 10 years old. Should be in top 10 greatest films list. A timeless masterpiece.,
540,11 May 2001,Hikage-sama,10, Eye candy in every way,"The Silence Of The Lambs was not the only masterpiece of 1991! There was also another movie called Terminator 2. Direct sequel to 1984´s hit movie The Terminator. 7 years after the original, film technology was not the same. The director used the latest FX in film industry to show his vision. And it was surly great. Breathtaking effects & action scenes who updated the genre to the much higher levels. The movie gives you the two coolest robots in movie history (along side with Bishop in Aliens). Also the second strongest action female star (after Ripley in Aliens) of all time. Everything from technical, directing, casting, music, atmosphere to the screenplay is great. This is the second time that James Cameron doing a sequel that is actually better than the original (he made also Aliens). I hope that True Lies 2(2002) is going to be even funnier & better than the original. You have to learn from history that you can trust James Cameron.  He is one of my greatest inspirations. I have seen all his movies several times (not the first one: Pirhana II from 1981). I could not find it on IMDB witch is bizarre. Here is the magical career of James Cameron in short: sensational hit low budget movie of 1984: The Terminator. The dynamic & adrenalin kick movie of 1986: Aliens. The very special one of 1989 & the godfather of CGI movies: The Abyss. The unbelievable eye candy of 1991 & another CGI godfather: Terminator 2. The gigantic action-comedy of 1994: True Lies.",

The second installment has Arnold coming back still as a Terminator, but now his job is to protect a now teenaged John Connor from a more advanced Terminator. Linda Hamilton reprises her role as Sarah Connor, John's mother. The film has lots of action and is certainly not going to put anybody to sleep! I believe this film is actually better than the original, which is a rarity for a sequel. The acting is better and I think the special effects are much better. The advanced Terminator is made of liquid metal and some of it's tricks are definitely cool! I like this flick.",

At the time, we weren't thinking critically about whether things made much sense and we weren't comparing it to the first movie (which most of us saw later).

This movie is a masterpiece for the cinematic blockbuster that it is compared to the gritty, horror/thriller that was the first one. Terminator 2 is, in all the essence of the word, the perfect movie blockbuster for the reason that it has all of the action elements hands down minus the weaknesses of a typical popcorn summer flick which is the lack of characterization and real drama. James Cameron achieved a character study with real human drama and a truly epic summer blockbuster with special effects that were truly ahead in 1991 and still match up today and are better than some 2009 blockbusters such as Transformers Revenge of the Fallen. Terminator 2 was the Avatar of 1991 in terms of special effects.",
544,18 August 2003,jasonz42,10, The most spectacular film of the 20th century,"OK, my tagline is slightly wrong: it should read 20th and 21st century. So long as you enjoy action-adventure films, Terminator 2: Judgement Day will probably be the greatest film you ever watch. It is not just any ordinary action adventure film, because it combines what very few big-money blockbusters do- action scenes and characters. The main characters, Sarah and john Connor and the terminator are developed so well throughout the film that by the end you find yourself doing what you rarely do in films- actually caring about the characters. It is this caring that then makes the rest of the film so fantastic, because every aciton scene has meaning behind it. Helped along by a fool-proof, well thought out plot, every single scene adds to the film and makes it all the more deep and meaningful. Robert Patrick delivers a stunning performance as the evil T-1000 and Hamilton, Furlong and Schwarzenegger bond fantastically well to create the ultra-realistic situation. Flawed practically no where, combining plot, depth of character, development, interest, action and every other important aspect a film should have, T2 is a triumphant achievement that thoroughly deserves its top 100 place. The only criticism you could have is it wavers from the dark aspect of T1 and includes more action sequences, but this is more a personal preference. Even if you normally hate action films, watch this one because it re-defines what a big blockbuster should be. He'll be back. Jas",

T2 is a Hollywood blockbuster film in every sense of the word: the action is big, the stakes are high and with Schwarzenegger at his peak.

A sequel promised more of the same with cutting edge effects, it should have been awesome. Instead, what we got was a fuzzy, cuddly terminator sent back to protect a masculine Sarah Conner and her unbelievably bratty son from the T1000 which was the only thing worth watching in this huge disappointment. The special effects WERE brilliant, I still love the sequence when the T1000 comes up through the floor but everything else about this bloated mess was over the top. Instead of the cold killer from the first movie, Arnie is almost human; certainly more so than the miserable portrayal Linda Hamilton gave. It's easy to see where Lena Headey got her inspiration from for her awful portrayal of the character. Also, are we seriously expected to believe that the nauseating, thieving little toe-rag played so badly by Edward Furlong could possibly grow up to be the saviour of humanity? Add to that the cheesy dialogue and all the silly one liners, catchphrases and explosions and what you are left with is nothing more than a Disney style movie with Michael Bay delusions. I gave this movie four and that was for the special effects, otherwise I would have given it a 1. It's a pity IMDb don't allow us to vote turkey, because this film deserved one.",

561,26 October 1998,NEFARlOUS,1, Oh dear.,"I was a big fan of the original. The plot was a good one, the actors convincing, even Arnie (although perhaps having 42 words in the entire film helped.)and the action took place largely at night. Five minutes into T2 when Arnie has killed no-one and nicked one guy's sunglasses, I thought *uh-oh* - one-liner ahoy, and sure enough, later one of many such gut-wrenchingly bad lines emerges, delivered with enough lack of Acting ability to cover his compatriots in splinters. Now sometimes a Movie can be salvaged by it's co-stars, but unfortunately although Linda Hamilton is the only member of the cast that emerges with any credibility, the young John Connor is so incredibly irritating that 30 minutes into the film, I wanted to kill him myself. That leaves the quintessential ""Baddie"" to sustain some sort of suspense and danger. Alas, James was still obviously obsessed with the morphing techniques he discovered while making ""The Abyss"" with the result that we end up with a robot that is supposed to be made up of liquid metal capable of altering it's colour, texture and size, and even reforming itself. All movies of this type call for a certain degree of suspension of disbelief, but this is just ludicrous. Even in ""non-liquid"" mode, the new wimpy looking terminator runs around with his head inclined - apparently this is supposed to be frightening. Throughout the film, we have lots of explosions, laughable dialog and in the end, Arnie the philosophical friendly cyborg. This film could have been a damn sight better, even with Arnie in the lead, but this seems to have been targeted at a preview audience of teenagers in the mid-west with all the ingredients that they tend to expect. It is quite simply yet another standard formulaic attempt to make money, not a decent film, but hey, Isn't that what Hollywood is about?",

Every time he's on the screen he's doing something incredibly cool, even when viewed 29 years later. The arc of Linda Hamilton's character, who we first see committed to an insane asylum, buff from body building but with a seriously dark side from being traumatized, is wonderful. The presence of the precocious, streetwise 10-year-old who must be saved at all costs is a bit of a mixed bag, but he adds levity in between action sequences without getting too irritating (I guess, hmm). And, with his much larger budget, James Cameron also ramped up the effects even in moments that are tangential to the main storyline, like that extraordinary vision of a nuclear bomb going off. There were issues with the script and too many cheesy Hollywood-type moments for my taste; I think I prefer the streamlined original, despite all the good things this one had going for it.

Most of the people I know who have watched this movie think of it only as an action movie. They don't seem to grasp the underlining theme of love and what you would do to protect those you care about most. Like Connor said, ""The machine seemed like more of a father than any of the ten's of men I brought home trying to protect him"". This movie is moving, and YES, the action is groundbreaking. This is a ""Hold on to your butt's"" (Samuel L. Jackson in Jurassic Park) kind of movie. Arnold portrayed a role he had previously done 7 years earlier but with more style and a sense of really embracing this emotionless machine who couldn't understand simple emotional functions. ""I know now why you cry."" was possibly the most memorable line for me in the entire movie (Considering ""I'll be back"" or ""Hasta La Vista, Baby"" or the smirking ""Trust me""). This machine had been through so much with this future-rebel savior that he had just understood an emotion. It was like breathing for the first time. Every aspect of this film was portrayed fantastically, from the camera work, to the long hours of early-computer graphics work done in movies. It was sad to see the following installments not to be as compelling as Judgement Day.

The concept of taking the villain from the original and making them the hero of the second is an unprecedented creative choice in the action genre and it allows for a myriad of opportunities, all of which the film capitalizes on in every way. Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a showcase of action set pieces that have become legend in film, the bike chase, the assault on Cyberdyne Systems HQ, the final showdown with the menacing T-1000 (Robert Patrick) and countless more. But beyond this it harbours a deep and meaningful theme throughout all the carnage, that if a machine can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too.",

596,13 May 2013,lesleyharris30,9," One of the Most Pleasing Sequels Out There,","Terminator 2: Judgement Day is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's an outstanding sequel that I think, unlike most, manages to improve upon the original, it's more action packed, the story is more intense and James Cameron once again does a very impressive job of making us feel for these characters. It's very slow for a long period of the movie, which I have to admit was an issue, it keeps you waiting for lengthy periods and you'll simply begin to crave excitement, although it isn't a huge flaw as it does gives time to develop the characters. Arnold Schwarzenegger is given a bigger and better role this time around, he is still the Terminator, but is he quite different from the original, he is now protecting the Connor family, and despite the lifeless robot personality that Schwarzenegger does so well, we begin to feel real a genuine affection for this character, it was amazing that they managed to do this and it is one of the movies strongest high points. Action packed, emotional and intense, fans will definitely be happy with Terminator 2: Judgement Day and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or sci-fi film.",

The Terminater is no longer the killing machine of yore, he shoots his enemy's in the knee cap, we have cliché laden dialogue 'why are your eyes leaking' 'what is the emotion called love human?'...terrible, terrible. The film is plainly aimed at the teen market, from the mall setting, teen lead and junk food and video game product placement it suffers as a result. It has many plot holes in it which other reviewers have covered. The acting from Lijnda Hamilton was competent though i didn't believe her descent in to psychosis. But is does have some saving elements, for those who saw the film at the cinema the effects did seem revolutionary at the time. The chase sequences though repeated endlessly are fast paced if doubtful.

Though, this one sparked many areas that the first one did not.  This movie had action, and suspense, and acting, and(of course) graphics that out-did the first one.  I may be talking into my generation, but it's an opinion that I hold, and one that I will keep.  Finally, Arnold was able to play the good guy, and he was still his old self.  The grim faced get-outta-way terminator that we all loved from the first one.  Linda Hamilton also improved, showing she can defend herself this time instead of always running.  To me, it's hard to decifer that a mental institution can turn you into a gun handling combat marine when you were once a soft hearted little angel that just wanted to be hugged.  But, that's what it was and it was fine with me.  I loved every moment of this action flick.  The soundtrack was above average, but the graphics are definitly the highlight of this film.  Nothing looked unreal, like it did in the first Terminator.  The bad guy was totally awesome.  He was basically indestructable in which made the movie actually pretty scary at times.  Horror and action made a nice blend for this movie.  Terminator 2: Judgement Day was definitely ""Bad to the bone"" and earned my 10/10 rating.

Now for sure, some scenes seems a bit old-fashioned (the future) but at least, all the stunts were real and have this density factor! For me this movie is also an amazing game for Gameboy and expected articles from magazines! In fact, i understand that this 80s past has 2 major time paradox: John Connors father comes from the future and also T1 hand/Bio-chip as the foundation of Skynet! So it's a pity that the final is too much like the first one because i would do it more BTTF way: in front of this deadly and unbeatable T1000, i would have T1 plunge into this fire with the hand/Bio-chip and so T1000 would have been erased by this new continuum!!

The movie begins the same way as the first with a T-800 (Arnold) coming back in time, except this time Arnold is the good guy assigned to protect John Connor from the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). If this was the plot of the film, I'm sure it wouldn't have been as successful. Cameron was smart enough to make the movie about the mission to prevent Judgment Day, so it gave us something fresh (although some scenes are recycled). ",
629,6 July 2012,drqshadow-reviews,9," Bold, Intelligent Writing and Spectacular Action Help This Sci-Fi Classic to Age Gracefully","I hadn't watched this in years and, to be honest, I was somewhat trepidatious about how it would hold up. As it turns out I should have known better; it's every bit the smart, emotive powerhouse I remembered, and miles better than most modern efforts in the same niche. One of the things I find most impressive about it is the respect it maintains for the original, where most sequels of this type (including T3 and Terminator Salvation) can't wait to distance and differentiate themselves from their lineage. Even though the first Terminator had aged quite a bit in the seven years between films, T2's sharp, daring script constantly cites events, characters and situations from its timeline like a religious zealot thumping the bible. It also builds directly upon the dark, challenging themes and premonitions of its predecessor, resulting in a towering, substantial world that seems so real I could almost touch it. Of course, I'd be silly not to mention the still-spectacular action scenes, which flawlessly build in size and scale until they reach a timely crescendo at the end of the third act. CGI was still in its infancy in the early '90s, but James Cameron's knack for its timely, appropriate application is already at veteran levels in T2. As a direct result, those infamous scenes with a transmorphing T-1000 remain striking and impressive, where other effects of the period now seem clunky and unrealistic. Not only is it one of the best sequels ever, it's among the very best of the batch in multiple genres, and Arnold has never been more at-home in a character.

The first 'Terminator' plays a lot like a sci-fi slasher movie. It's very John Carpenter. 'T2' is very much the blockbuster sequel that it was. It's more sci-fi action than sci-fi horror.

One last thing is that it seems like an easy ten but swaznigger made it that easier.,
641,13 January 2021,tuzzolojoe-14313,10, One of the exceptions where the sequel surpassed the original,"T2: Judgement Day is not only a piece of cinematic history, but the special effects and cinematography were groundbreaking and ahead of it's time. The movie is now 30 years old and there aren't many cases of 30 year old films that the special effects are up to today's standards.
This movie was the very first movie that my father took me to go see. In 1991 I was only 4 years old and I could understand how amazing this film was at that age because I made my dad take me to see it two more times. Now I'm not sure if I was lucky or if it was bad parenting but aside from the fact that my father was taking me to my very first venture to the movies, and we went to go see a violent rated R film, but it is my very first memory of sitting in a theater being absolutely mesmerized by James Cameron's classic blue tint cinematography and the T-1000's liquid metal alloy body, but I digress.
Now, to the title of my reviews point. Terminator (1984) is a classic in it's own right, but T2 has everything you want from a blockbuster film plus much much more. Cameron's choice to swap the Terminators character and make him a babyface as opposed to the murderous heel he was in the original is genius. After watching Terminator (1984), you wouldn't believe it's possible to take the antagonists (Scwartzenegger) character and completely switch the script and make him the main protagonist of the sequel, but that's exactly what is done, and it's done masterfully! Cameron adds this element of dry humor to the Terminator this time around and it bounces off of John Connor (Furlong) perfectly. By the end of the film, Connor looks at the Terminator as a father figure...a father figure! This ruthless, cold blooded, robotic murderer from the future in the original is portrayed as the protagonist so well in T2 that not only do you not want him to terminate himself in the end, but you genuinely care about him.
I recently watched T2 by sheer luck because I saw it was available on the showtime app and for me, T2 is one of those films that I can watch whenever I see it on cable. I hadn't seen it in a while - probably a few years so I was excited to rewatch it. It's amazing how much of the lines I remembered straight through the film, but when you're watching a cinematic marvel such as this, how could you forget all the memorable lines throughout the film? From start to finish I was completely immursed.
This is more of an opinion of the film as opposed to a review but THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE! Regardless if after reading this I may seem bias, it has an 8.5 rating on this app and the movies lines are still used today. I'm sure you have heard ""hasta la vista, baby!"" ""I'll be back"" or ""come with me if you want to live"" at some point recently and those lines will live forever, just like this movie. It's easily the best of the entire franchise and was able to blow away audiences 30 years ago and trust me, if you've read this review and are now about to go watch Terminator 2: Judgement Day...Prepared to be blown away as well!",
642,14 June 2005,rawdeal007,9, Best sequel EVER!,"If there was a 'Top 100 sequels' list on IMDb this will be No.1 for sure (idea IMDb guys & gals?).

Everything works so well; the complex story line, the characters, the changes to Sarah Conner's character in relation to 'The Terminator'. Every character is cast to perfection and each one plays their part almost seamlessly. The first Terminator was great and had a really 'dark' feeling. Which made the 'warm' feeling of 'T2' work so well considering the subject matter. It really shouldn't leave you with a sense of warmth and inspiration, but you can't help but feel good inside after watching it. The attention to detail is second to none. And what a theme tune!!!",
643,22 May 2020,fernandoschiavi,9," ""Terminator 2"" remains a great classic of cinema, amplifying elements of action, science fiction and terror in an instigating story full of anthological moments","James Cameron had already managed to raise the bar for a powerful franchise, but he hadn't created it with ""Aliens (1986)"" and decided seven years later to make the film sequence that elevated him to one of the biggest names in Hollywood. After the revolutionary first film that brought science fiction with a new, frightening and, above all, credible premise to the public, the time came to raise the concepts previously discussed to a new level. The film remained paused for a time, because of Schwarzenegger's busy career and problems with franchise rights, disputed by the original distributor Hemdale and the producer Carolco. After Carolco bought the rights in 1990, Cameron finally signed on to do T2 in March 1990, without even having a script ready. The feature film was the first of what would be James Cameron's hallmark, the extravagance in writing, producing and directing films with large budgets, as could be seen in the following years in ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"", which for a long time were the two biggest box office in the history of cinema.",

It has tons of originality in it's action so it's very memorable. I love the characters and music, but one thing sucks. I really don't like that they made a puppet of terminator. I understand that he's following all commands, but the commands of ""you can't kill people"" is just so lame and dumb. They clearly made it into a family movie. There's even a scene in which he shoots with minigun and M-79 and nobody gets killed, so like what's the point of that shootout. But the worst thing is the ending e suicides for the sake of deleting trails, but it's obvious that skynet will send more terminators and John will need all the help he could get, so what's the point of suicide and removing all evidence if there is going to spawn some terminators later on anyways...

646,16 June 2015,vishaal811,10," Hasta la Vista, Baby","This is the ultimate action science fiction movie. There have been many imitators of this masterpiece, however, none of them come close to replicating the sheer brilliance of this flick by James Cameron. It is not very often that you see a sequel surpass the original in terms of quality. Terminator 2 improves upon every aspect such as storytelling, acting and special effects. It was one of the most expensive movies made at that time and the elaborate sets and the innovative visual effects were possible due to the huge budget. This movie focuses on John Connor who is depicted wonderfully by Edward Furlong. A terminator is sent to terminate John Connor who is supposed to be the future leader of the war against machines. In the original movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the antagonist, however, in this movie he is entitled with the job to protect John Connor. All the actors give terrific performances that elevates this movie to another level altogether. Even after 30 years, this movie still feels fresh and it will remain a fan-favorite for years to come. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.",
647,18 January 1999,RoLaren,10, One of the best kick-ass movies ever made!,"For adrenaline-fueled action & suspense, great FX, cast, soundtrack and more, it's hard to be T2. It's even got a love interest, although you need to view the director's cut or see the first Terminator movie to see this. With its apocalyptic, but not completely void of hope, vision of the future, T2 leaps off the screen and into your face and stays there. I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie, and I still watch it (I own the director's cut). Linda Hamilton's tough-tender Sarah Connor is one of the best female characters ever created for the screen. In order to get the complete story and appreciate her character's evolution, however, you need to watch both Terminator films--which is not to say that either film does not stand on its own; they do. Full of memorable scenes and great one-liners. Cameron's direction is fast-paced, the editing tight and the sound terrific. A classic in the sci-fi pantheon. Among the scenes cut from the final release is a dream sequence in which Kyle Reese visits Sarah Connor in the state hospital. In my opinion, it should've been left in: it reminds us of what she's lost and fleshes out her character even more.",
648,15 June 2018,mhorg2018,10, A Brilliant Sequel,"Cameron strikes again. Before his Ego and two billion dollar earning movies turned him into a bit of a prat, Cameron made this movie. He turned things on their head by having two Terminators come back, one programmed to be good, the other programmed to be a killer. The T1000 is amazing with its morphing abilities. Unlike the stupid TX from T3, which could create all kinds of weapons, the T1000 is a weapon. As long as it can stab or grab. It's grounded in physics of reality. The action is this is even crazier than Terminator, but then it had a budget twenty times larger. A brilliant movie that's endlessly watchable.",
649,27 March 2005,basrolf,10, It's part of my life,"This movie really influenced my live, because every time I watch this movie I begin to freeze, my whole body is icy, every detail in this movie is a ten. The music, perfect. Special effects, phenomenal, better than some effects in present movies. Just the opening is hard to top. All action sequences are well out pointed. It's been said that sequels are not better than the first one but thats wrong. From the first till the last minute this movie is worth any penny it costs. There is enough action for 5 movies. It was good choice from Cameron to give Schwarzenegger the role of the terminator in the first movie. He is just the perfect actor for this role. I've done school report about the movie: A +, like the film. Arnold Schwarzenegger is, till today, the only action star who has the same action in his live like in his film. Gos bless the Govenator of California.",
650,24 March 2020,a_chinn,9," Archetypal ""A Boy and His Dog"" story except with a Terminator","It never occurred to me before, but T2 is really an archetypal ""A Boy and His Dog"" story along the lines of ""Old Yeller"" or ""Pete's Dragon"" or ""ET: The Extraterrestrial."" I'll assume anyone reading this has already seen the movie, so spoilers ahead. Arnold Schwarzenegger was a huge star when this sequel was made, so this time he HAD to be the hero of the film, this time becoming the protector of a young John Connor, who is being hunted by a more advanced Terminator model played to perfection by Robert Patrick with cold animal-like predatory menace. The ""Boy and His Dog"" story starts fairly quickly, as a young John Connor befriends the futuristic killer cyborg. Connor teaches him tricks (i.e. that car keys are often under sun visors and, of course, ""Hasta la vista, baby""), the boy and his pet Terminator save each other at different points in the film, and in the end John has to give his beloved Terminator a sad farewell that's every bit as touching as when the boy in ""Old Yeller"" says to his mama ""Listen. Old Yeller just saved your life and Elizabeth's, too. And he saved mine and Arliss'. We can't. We don't know for certain. I'll pen him up where he can't get out. A-and then we'll wait. We could not shoot up like he was nothing. Don't you understand?"" Or when Elliott in ""E.T."" tells his pet alien ""You could be happy here, I could take care of you. I wouldn't let anybody hurt you. We could grow up together, E.T."" And in T2, it's every bit as touching when the Terminator tells John there is another Cyberdyne chip that must also be destroyed, to which John replies, ""No, no no!! It'll be okay. Stay with us! Don't do it. Please... don't go --"" with tears streaming down his face. So my point here is that you pair the durable ""Boy and His Dog"" story with wildly exciting and muscular action courtesy of director/co-writer James Cameron (man, do I wish he'd make a straight-up non-preachy action film again ALA ""The Terminator"" or ""Aliens"") and strong performances by Patrick as the T-1000, Edward Furlong as the young John Connor, and particularly Linda Hamilton as the fierce and buffed our tiger mom, Sarah Connor, you have a movie that's pretty irresistible. The CGI does seem fairly primitive at times, but most of it surprisingly holds up with the mix of practical and CGI when displaying the T-1000's knives and stabbing weapons. If I did have a complaint upon rewatching T2, it's that the sequel shifted too greatly in tone from the original, relying too much on one-liners and comedic elements. Admittedly, the one-liners are good and the comedy is genuinely funny, but the hard edge of the original is what makes that first film easily the best in the series. Still, sequels of this era had a penchant for radical shifts in tone and story (i.e. ""Mad Max"" to the ""The Road Warrior"" or ""First Blood"" to ""Rambo: First Blood Part II""). Overall, although T2 takes a major shift in the direction of family-friendly with the ""A Boy and His Dog"" storyline, but the characters, story, and especially the action are brilliant and impossible not to enjoy.",

James Cameron is known for his strong female characters and Sarah Connor has to be the toughest. One reason I think why this action film appeals to many females vs. every other action films where the girl is in distress, waiting to be saved. But that's not the main reason everyone digs this film, it's simply how perfectly the film is crafted.

But I don't really count that because it was only a, what I call a worm coming out of the water. This movie has the T-100 walking through steel bars, changing into a police guard by just the makeup of his footprint, and when he gets shot, he refills the hole with his liquid metal. This movie has it all, tons of explosions, more of an in-depth look at Skynet, and has Arnold shooting at cops with a Mini Gun.

I finally saw T2 in the late 90s after seeing the first terminator on VHS and liked that one. Now this one is a step above the first in terms of special effects, originality, and action and scope. The inclusion of Guns and Roses in the soundtrack is pretty good. This movie was the first DVD-18 I bought, which contains multiple versions of the film. The ultimate director's cut is highly recommended, as it contains scenes not seen in the theatrical version. I'll probably not see it in 4k 3d since I'll get it on bluray soon.",

Robert Patrick really suited the role of the T-1000, which in my opinion is better than the rubbish T-100 which Arnold plays. I do think this is the better one out of the two with better fight scenes and better gun fights. Also i think that the T-1000 is a lot better than the T-100 because well lets face it in the first he wasnt really the smartest of all robots was he? And he not exactlly the most strong all you would have to do is blow him up with a grenade and he's history!!! I would give this film a 7/10 for all round. 9/10for the effects at that time.",

The plot is well thought out and expands on the concepts presented in the first, as well as feeling like a natural continuation of the story.

One might also say that James Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgement Day is one such film. That actually impresses me because the 1984 film is no slouch. It is an incredible horror/sci-fi classic that launched the respective Cameron's directing and Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting careers. The sequel took everything up a notch. While the original film was a more horror-based, contained story, the sequel is more about the intense action sequences and the incredible, earth-shattering special effects. In a way, T2 is similar to Jaws in how the film revolutionized moviegoing. Without Cameron's action masterpiece, there would be no effects-driven films like Jurassic Park. Say what you will about the laziness of filmmakers using special effects these days, but sometimes masterpieces such as this film comes along. In addition to great visual effects and makeup, this is also a storytelling triumph. Screenwriters Cameron and William Wisher came up with a way to invest in the characters giving them emotional character arcs. While Schwarzenegger's bot was a killer machine in the original, he was a father figure and protector to young John Connor. Meanwhile, Sarah Connor was anything but. She was hospitalized because of severe mental issues. Her understanding of how the world will come to be made her seemingly more machine than human. Cameron put some thought into his characters developing them into three-dimensional characters that we can all root for...except for Robert Patrick's T-1000 villain, a true technological wonder.

She only had a vulnerable young boy from the future who she fell in love with and lost. I don´t say the second was bad. But the most touching scenes was those who reminded me of the first movie. Like when John wonders about his dad and they show Sarah photos from the policestation 1984. Its also is hard to see ""father unknown"" when the computer scrolls down information about John.

692,16 March 2020,Rendanlovell,7, The original is better,"Watched the Extended Special Edition cut for the first time and definitely prefer the Theatrical over this. That said, this review is for the Extended Special Edition cut.
Unfortunately for T2 there is little in the way of story that's very fresh. It's essentially the same movie as the first movie. It hits the same beats in the same places and has incredibly similar action set pieces. There are some new things in here like them going and blowing up Skynet. There a few new places they visit but at the core of it, it's very similar. Plus, the humor and one liners go little bit too far. There's great moments with the Terminator learning human emotion like when he attempts to smile but, there's a bit much of it. Speaking of elements that are a bit much, the product placement is EXCESSIVE. The amount of Pepsi and Subway in this movie is insane. Drinking, eating, and turning products towards the camera are only the start of it. While I'm complaining I may as well address the bizarre structure choices. The first hour or so is the Terminator sequel we would expect. A Terminator trying to get a guy and a guy protecting that guy. Pretty simple stuff but then it shifts into being about the creation of Skynet. Where our characters confront the creator and blow up the cyberdine building. It almost completely abandons the T-1000, barely mentioning it and showing it even less. When the T-1000 forces its way back into the movie it feels like the Skynet creation movie ends and the Terminator sequel begins again. It's jarring and only works thanks to pretty good writing but it's still an odd choice to make.
But this movie still rules. The characters are far more interesting then they are in the first movie and the themes presented far outdo the original. Even though there are a lot of similar action sequences, they absolutely RIP in this movie. The camera work is far slicker and more fluent thanks to the big budget making each sequence more engaging. There's a great blend of old school effects (rear screen projection, puppeteering, matte paintings, stop motion) and new school effects. It's also one of the last big budget action movies I can think of that meldes a ton of genres together seemlessly. You got The Thing type body horror, big action set pieces, comedic moments, character drama, and of course sci-fi. The Terminator is cooler, the action hits harder, the characters are more dynamic, and the filmmaking is top notch. Still one of the coolest sequels to a classic movie ever.",

Anyhow, as was the case the first time when Sarah Connor was the target, the new Terminator has not come back through time alone. The future human resistance has sent back someone to protect the Terminator's target. Of course the leader of that future resistance is John Connor. The Terminator's target is John Connor. So yes, John Connor has sent someone back though time to save John Connor. The first time around John sent a human back to save his mom and, no small detail this, ensure he would be conceived in the first place. Which makes very little sense if you think about it so I guess the best advice is don't think about it. Anyhow this time John doesn't send back a human to stop the Terminator. He sends back another Terminator. Oh, this is going to be good. Two Terminators from the future, a good one and a bad one, running amuck in Los Angeles. Lots of gunfights, lots of explosions, lots of beautiful mayhem.",

Unsurprisingly one of the greatest sequels of all time, this legendary director ensures Judgement Day is a character driven, heartfelt story about family, exploring the strained & complex relationship between a mother & her son first, always maintaining the film's focus on the progression between the two as a priority, despite it also being a groundbreaking action flick; the set pieces never come at the expense of true character moments & he strikes a masterful balance between them both.
What's clear is these movies (Terminator 1 & 2) should've been left untouched with no further installments that could taint the franchise's impact or the beautifully written narrative.
Embarrassingly, until today, I'd never actually seen Terminator 2 & still haven't watched the third in the original trilogy, despite having viewed Genisys & Salvation... All I can say now after watching is: why are they continuing to make any more & mess with what was such perfection?

Since, according to THE TERMINATOR, only living things can travel through time, how could the completely liquid metal T1000 travel through time?  The theatrically released version also has one other very weak point.  How does John Connor (Edward Furlong) recognize the T1000 copy of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from his mother?  The Special Edition clarifies this, showing the T1000 malfunctioning.  This crucial scene should never have been deleted from the theatrical release.  Also, the only fakey sequences in the film are two shots using Stan Winston's Oscar-winning special effects.  Other than the T1000 malfunction sequence, the additional material in the Special Edition gives the film a sluggish middle.  Still, this an extremely powerful film, with fine acting from everyone, especially Robert Patrick, who is chilling as the T1000.",

709,18 March 2002,Angry_Arguer,10, Glaring time inconsistancies made up for by incredible FX (SPOILERS!),"Okay, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is probably my most addictive movie; ever since I saw it at age 8. Yeah, I was probably to young to see it, but what are you going to do, send a terminator back in time to PREVENT me from seeing it? Anyway, I label it my most addictive movie because while I feel it's not the best movie ever made like some other people, I still have an urge to see it quite often. While one can go on and on about how often the concept of time gets screwed up (example: Judgment Day is to happen in two years judging from Sarah's prologue. Arnie latter explains Cyberdyne's work as taking place ""three years from now"" and SkyNETs origins as later on). The whole plotline of events is really messed up and I was just hoping Arnold would be the killer again. Instead, Robert Patrick has to try and be as menacing as possible, which doesn't come off all that well. Oh well, maybe next time. The teaser/credits scene makes up for the gaping action hole in the middle. The movie itself definitely could've been a lot shorter. Hopefully with Terminator 3 they will get what they got wrong this time right. Also, Terminator 4 should have TWO T800s trying to kill John who's defended by ANOTHER T800, Arnold would definitely get his pay that way around.",

716,30 May 2003,mikeslant,10, One of the greatest action movies of all time,"I remember when I was little and this came out, I wanted to see it so bad but I was never allowed to. Finally, when it was on PPV, my Dad let me see the last twenty-five minutes or so and I loved it. It wouldnt be until I went to my freinds birthday party that year that I would fully experience 'Judgement Day'. While T2 is a sequel with a new story arch, James Cameron in some ways was doing a remake. Now with the budget he originally needed he could tell the story he truly wanted to tell but couldnt. (Such as the T-1000 character, who he came up with during the first film)You'll notice similar set pieces and lines, similar action scenes to the ninth degree. John Carpenter did something similar to this with Escape from L.A., a sequel to Escape from New York that was in some ways a remake because the budget he was able to get. All similarities aside, T2 is a force to be reckoned with. Though T1 maybe scarier, with its edgy world and dark themes, as well as a much scarier Arnold, T2 has some scary moments too, as well as some of the most complex and extremely entertaining action scenes ever scene. Even by todays standars, the special effects in T2 rock. Maybe becasue they only used CGI when puppetry and animatronic and make-up effects wouldnt work, and they only used those effects when regular people or sets couldnt work. Something the new Star Wars movies could take a hint from, only use CGI if you HAVE to. T2 isnt just an action movie though. From the opening chse scenes that begins in a mall and ends in a flood chanel, to the closing shootouts and chases that start at a Cyberdyne office and end in a steel mill, T2 mixes in a touching and emotional story of surival and characters. In a way, T2 is storyline based, character driven, with huge shootouts, chases and special effects along the way to make it a blast. The T-1000 is very scary and creepy, Arnold is more over the top than he was in T1, but he still kicks butt. The opening scene that shows the future war still stands tall as one of the coolest battle scenes in all of cinema, and when John and the Machine talk about how humans arent going to make it, that it is in our nature to kill each other, creeps me out how very true it is. T2 shouldnt be missed by anyone, though it lacks some in the originality factor, it makes up for it in slam bang visuals, widely entertaining shootouts and chases, one liners, good acting, and a great story. When you think about it, The Matrix copied alot of the things the Terminator franchise created, accept added on action elements that could never be completed in real life, but made up a reason why it could. Either way, Matrix is cool, but T2 (and T1) are flat out amazing. **** out of ***** 9/10",

Linda Hamilton was superb in T2.(I fell in love with that body!) She was almost as unstoppable as the machine in her pursuit of saving her son and mankind. I'm not a fan of your basic Sci-fi special effects. Snarling aliens drooling slime all over their victims, and gross mutant alien-babies popping out of humans don't thrill me. But it T2, Cameron does it best, it's more believable. With technology these things could happen. I was blown out of my seat with the EXTREME special effects, and chase scenes.

No one had seen anything like the T-1000 before, Robert Patrick was a great casting. I think the terminator films are Arnold Schwarzeneggers decent film achievements. So many good scenes in this film to talk about but ones that stand out are the T-1000 copying John Conners step mum and when speaking to John on the phone in her voice you hear a slice and then the camera moves over to show that she has a metal knife sliced into Johns step-Dads face, great idea. The T-1000 rising up through the black and white tiles to morph into the police officer. Edward Furlong was also a great casting he was perfect for the part, he had no acting experience and they just found him and went to the lengths to train him to do the part, which was worth it. The music helps this film have another side to it having music for the 2 machines and Sarah Conners flashbacks its eary. So many different things to look at when watching this film like the relationship between humans and a learning machine. This for me is a truly complete film and the 3rd film should never have been made its just as well James Cameron didn't choose the alternate ending for the 2nd otherwise the mony grabbers would have been stuffed to make a third.

The action is fast and furious and each sequence gets larger and more elaborate than the first one.  Cars, trucks, motorcycles and every other type of vehicle you can think of get tossed through the air, blown up and shot up. But at the heart of all this visual mayhem, is a story that deals with relationships.  There's the relationship between John Connor and the Terminator, and how the Terminator starts to grow into a surrogate father.  Then there's the relationship between John and his mother, Sarah, and that's where the real heart of the film is.  Sarah cares for her son, but for the wrong reasons.  She knows what the future holds and she protects him from everything.  In doing so, Sarah has shut herself out of John's life and alienated herself from the rest of humanity.  But when you know how and when the world will end, you'll look at things differently.  The film has not diminished with time.  It's well made and the effects are still amazing. I especially like the scene where the T-1000 comes rising out of a checkerboard floor.  I remember hearing people gasp in awe when that was on.  What I will always remember from T2, is the thrill of seeing it for the first time, and when that metal foot comes down crushing that skull, I can still see the entire theater jumping in unison.  Terminator 2 raised the action and special effects bar to new levels, and only just recently, has that been surpassed.",

I was skeptical, because the whole idea of a cyborg battling another cyborg to save a boy, his mother, and humanity alike simply didn't appeal to me. In all honesty, it sounded like the type of movie you hear characters talking about in a Saturday morning cartoon.

James Cameron put so much effort into making this movie, it all paid off too. I admire all of his work. If this movie had not been made, they would have never been able to make Jurrasic Park. They made so many breakthroughs while doing this movie. If you can catch it, in some clips Robert Patrick had to put a suit on that looked like liquid metal.

In ""Terminator 1"", John Conner teleports Rees to the past;
Rees and Sarah Conner gave birth to John Connor, forming a closed loop.

So they have to find Miles Dyson and break this cycle.
Miles Dyson is the culprit inventing Skynet and indirectly destroying the world in the parallel universe, but in this universe has become a hero who protects humanity at the cost of life.
The change in John Connor's attitude towards his mother is also very impressive.
He always thought his mother was a lunatic and a loser.
Until one day, he discovered that everything his mother said was true.
Skynet set the T-800's central processor to read-only, preventing him from thinking.
Such a sentimental killer is actually willing to end world in exchange for peace.

778,24 July 2015,Vontoria,10, A sci-fi masterpiece,"Terminator 2 was one of my favourite movies growing up as a kid, and I didn't even understand it. Re-watching it now, makes me understand that without this movie, science fiction would not be the same as it is today. I don't even know where to start, the action is amazing, the frightening terminator in the first film was an achievement in itself for action, however, having two terminators, with vastly different abilities, was just fantastic. Even Sarah Connor kicked ass in this movie, as the badass mentor for John Connor. Schwarzenegger was the best part of this movie, his bond with John was a beautiful thing to see, and the humour was excellently portrayed in every character, it was always used when appropriate, and didn't shy away the seriousness of the plot. Speaking of the plot, T2 delves considerably deeper into the origin of Skynet, and explores a lot more moral issues than the first movie did. The villain of the movie, the T-1000, was portrayed excellently by Robert Patrick, this is one of those villains that doesn't have a disturbing physical appearance, but is frightening simply because of what he is capable of. This dynamic really helped to increase the stakes this time around, truly showing that John is crucial to the plot, and having him be a helpless kid made the T- 1000 an even more imposing antagonist. James Cameron did a particularly good job directing this movie. Every shot was clear, which allowed the action to be made more prominent on screen, and generally improved the viewing experience. The acting was also great, I was actually surprised at how good Edward Furlong's performance was, as he was quite young at the time. The CGI in T2 was fantastic for it's time, and still holds up today. In fact, I'd go as far to say it's actually BETTER looking than a lot of movies today, now that's an achievement. It also wasn't overused, which is a great sight to see, as the use of stunts and practical effects makes the movie so much more believable. ",

It had speed, knowledge, strength, etc... and it was defeated? In the end, it would have cut off Terminator's head over that factory grill, not ""stabbed"" him and left him for dead. (though it would have killed Terminator long before that scene) It would have stabbed Sarah in the eye.. but why even ASK for her to yell for 'John' when he could mimic her voice perfectly (and did so 3 minutes later). So unrealistic. Then a 'magic' gun destroys it? And the end just happens to take place in another weird factory? This time a steel liquid molten factory? T- 1000 was incapable of being destroyed, until suddenly they made it capable. Ridiculous 90s film.

In a last ditch effort the Artificially Intelligent computer system Skynet, built originally by Cyberdine Industries, sent the terminator back to kill Sarah Connor before her son John could even be conceived.  However, that Terminator failed in its mission.  But, somehow Skynet must have stayed in power, because the T-1000 series obviously was created much later in time than the Arnold model series.  It was a vast technological improvement that could only have been created much after Reese went back in time, as he had no knowledge of such a machine.  In fact, the humans apparently were to have blown up the time machine as soon as Reese went through.  It's a shame that Cameron never explained this.

792,28 October 2021,adampkalb,10, A great action movie and sequel with a lot of heart.,"Terminator 2: Judgement Day is one of those rare sequels famous for surpassing the original predecessor in every way. It had a much bigger budget than the first movie (justified by all of the new liquid metal special effects and more frequent vehicle damage), a longer runtime with a more substantially deep plot (seriously, watch the extended version to see some good additional scenes for which the theatrical release was already long enough without having them), and longer but well-directed action scenes. Joe Morton was a great supporting actor in this movie and another extended classic, the 4-hour happy hour-I mean, The Justice League's Zack Snyder cut. Even compared to the theatrical version of Terminator 2, The Justice League's Joss Whedon cut was too short and too silly. Terminator 2: Judgement Day feels like a great movie on which to blow your entire 100 million-dollar budget because James Cameron pulled out all the stops with non-digital car and helicopter chases, and there was lots of thrilling suspense to be had in every sequence of Sarah and John trying to escape the T-1000. It was kind of nice how Alien inspired James Cameron to make The Terminator with another female protagonist escaping from and then fighting some type of sci-fi monster. The Terminator and Alien were both sci-fi action and horror at the same time, and Terminator 2 and Aliens are sci-fi action movies that downplay the horror elements quite a bit.",

Set 12 years into the future from the original, Arnold comes back through time for another titillating thrill ride, but this time Sarah Connor is a secondary target. Her son John Connor, the future savior of men, is a young man living with his foster parents after his mother was committed to a mental health facility. What makes ""Judgment Day"" different from the original is that there is a new more advanced model of the Terminator. The T-1000 is a liquid metal robot who can take the shape of anything he touches as long as it is relatively the same size. He can also form knives and stabbing weapons. This movie is another James Cameron classic, which keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire movie while displaying a very relevant theme: ""The future's not set.

804,12 July 2017,stormhawk2021,10, Greatest movie of all time,"One of the most intelligent, imaginative and riveting sci-fi, action flicks to hit the screens ever, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is a classic without equal. What's even more surprising is that ""T2"" is a sequel of an already great film. 1984's ""The Terminator"" was an interesting premise that Cameron pulled off ably and catapulted Arnold Schwarzenegger to the stratosphere of movie stardom. ""T2"" has brains to spare to go with the action and there's a lot to like. The movie banks on the insight that humans are more destructive to the world than any machine can be. Linda Hamilton's amped-up Sarah Connor is the real emotional machine in ""T2"" unable to see beyond the mission of saving her son for the sake of a doomed humanity. She has such little faith in humankind that her actions become robotic. The performances are top-notch. This is Schwarzenegger's key role and Hamilton has never been better. Robert Patrick's steely performance is incredibly menacing and Edward Furlong is innocent yet with strong conviction. ""T2"" was well ahead of its time with its digital effects and it uses them magnificently. There's nothing not to like about ""T2"", it's loaded with imagination, thrills and action.",
805,9 June 2015,geminiredblue,9, I'll Be Back... Two!!!,"In 2029, the battle rages on between killer machines and human resistance fighters. In a plot to eliminate John Connor, leader of the rebellion, the machines sent a Terminator back to 1984 to eliminate his mother, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). When that failed, the machines sent one more. This one about thirteen years later, to eliminate John himself while still a child. This time around, the resistance chose to send another protector: a re-programmed Terminator T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Flashback to '97 (though filmed in '91), John Connor (Edward Furlong) is a disrespectful, foul-mouthed, little punk. As for Sarah, gone is the mousy woman from the first film. She's now a hard-as-nails survivalist. Because she tried to blow up a computer company, she got put into a mental institution. With steely determination, the new Terminator, T-1000 (Robert Patrick), tracks down and attempts to kill them both. But the T-800 proves quite a worthy defender! Building upon the original movie, Terminator 2 goes further into the back story of how Judgment Day came around. As well as the scientists responsible for the fateful events. The relationship between the three central characters is at turns touching and even heartbreaking. Personally, I got a little tired of John's wise-ass attitude after a while. And perhaps Sarah's tough persona was a little too violent and unstable at times. But the movie does have some thought-provoking comments to make on technology gone awry, and man's inevitable slide into self-destruction. Visual effects have never been put to better use, especially in regards to the T-1000, who has the ability to morph itself into virtually anyone. My only real complaint is with the re-issued special edition that adds about thirty minutes of footage back in. Some of the extra stuff seems unnecessary. But apart from that, this film is pitch-perfect. Representing the best that sci-fi/ action has to offer!",

Ok, well then John would instantaneously have to disappear, because if there was no war, why would Kyle Reese be sent back. And if he wasn't sent back, he and Sarah would never meet, i.e. there would be no existence of John Connor. Sarah would probably lose all memory of him and the war, and would go back to her wimpy existence as a student/waitress.

823,2 August 2020,TheOny13,10," It only works the second time around, at least with the Terminator franchise","So what do I mean with that? It's simple, it's about the premise of the movie, which is almost the same as the first Terminator movie. So the premise in the first movie is that John Connor sents his father Kyle Reese to protect his mother after the Machines sent a Terminator into the past to kill Sarah Connor. And the whole movie is about protecting Sarah Connor at all costs. Sure that is a pretty great premise and it makes for a great movie that is almost flawless. The second time arround the Machines sent a prototype Terminator made of liquid into the past to kill John Connor so the humans (John Connor) sent a reprogrammed Terminator to protect John Connor. The plot plays out pretty much the same as in the first movie and that the Terminator must protect John Connor at all costs from the liquid one. But, and there's a big BUT, the movie has an original spin and touch to it that makes it still feel original while at the same time feeling like part of the first movie's story. It expands the context about the war between the humans and the machines and at the same time sents a great message about war, about destroying ourselves or about what is the difference between humans and machines.",

I would go so far as to say that if you saw and understood The Terminator, then saw and understood T2, you could only like the sequel if concepts such as consistency and plot integrity were of no value to you whatsoever. If you like a cheap grab-bag of special effects tacked onto the top of a cynical, lazy effort to rehash the original film and make loads of money, I can see why you might like T2. As a sequel to one of the most intelligent action films of the 80s, however, this is an abomination of a movie. If you think the two stories can be viewed as mutually compatible, you have a very poor grasp of the logic and metaphysics of the narrative universe set up in The Terminator. Basically Cameron and Wisher set out their rules in The Terminator, and then proceed to break them at every step here, hoping that the audience will be too stupid to notice or care. Sadly, for the most part they were proved correct.",

Schwarzenegger returns to his defining role and Robert Patrick plays the T-1000 to perfection. Linda Hamilton provides another decent performance as Sarah Connor and Edward Furlong plays John Connor brilliantly to provide some comic relief and Dr. Silberman returns , played by Earl Boen again. The story is basically the same as the previous film. Keep John Connor alive so he can save mankind.

831,17 December 2000,odin2001,9, The definitive early 90's movie,"James Cameron seems incapable of directing out of his decade.  The Terminator looks VERY 80's, Titanic (despite being set almost a century ago) looks and feels VERY late 90's.  And Terminator 2 is the definitive early 90's movie, complete with it's soundtrack featuring Guns and Roses. T2 is a also a multi-faceted action epic touching on issues such as one's fate, advances in computer technology (done much better than it, say, The Matrix), and John Connor's search for a father.  There are some truly great moments in the movie such as when Sarah Connor says ""come here"" to her son after surviving an attempt on their lives by the sinister T-1000 (portrayed by a fabulous Robert Patrick).  John thinks this an invitation for a hug and a chance at some of the mother-son relationship that they've missed with her being in an institution.  But when he wraps his arms around her, he realizes she's checking for bullet wounds.  ""I'm fine!"" he protests.  ""John!"" she snaps back, ""You're too important!""  She thinks of him less as a son and more  as an icon for the future. The movie has very extreme action sequences and very subtle bits of sentimentality and criticism of the 90's lifestyle.  T2 is truly one of the greatest action movies of all time, as well as one of the greatest sequels of all time, as it surpasses the mood and action of the first while touching of issues that The Terminator never even considered.",

The hype about it was out of this world, seemingly even more than ""Batman"" got, which also was unreal. Everybody seemed to blown away by it and the commercials and trailers really got you pumped. Naturally, I was too young to watch it at the cinema, and that's something I am truly envious of people who did first time, so I had to wait until it was shown at a pay TV channel at my uncles apartment. And boy, it left an impact that sticks to this very day, more than 20 years later.

I was around eight years old when the film came out and I remember the cultural impact the film made and how its violence became a controversial flashpoint. Not allowed to watch it at a young age, I think I eventually first saw it in 1992 when on a trip with my father. I've seen it numerous times since, it's an incredibly re-watchable film. Cameron's great idea here is to bring back Arnold's Schwarzenegger's menacing Terminator and instead of a bad guy, he has been captured, re-wired, and sent back in time to become a guardian protector of John Connor - a kid who is vital to the future resistance. The threat facing John Connor is an upgraded Terminator, the T-1000 that is made of liquid metal and can morph into anything it touches, sent back in time to take John out. Cameron takes this simple science fiction premise and uses it as a vehicle for all-time great action sequences (the final act is one legendary set piece after another) and a chance to explore the implications of fate and, in an unexpected surprise, a surprisingly touching reflection on fatherhood. Everyone is on their A-game here: Cameron's never produced better set pieces, Arnold is at his most charismatic while he is trashing people in action scenes and whipping out funny lines, John Connor is perfect as a punk kid with limits, and Linda Hamilton is fully transformed into the butt-kicking conspiracy theorist.

The fact that John's father has not been born yet and John is going to send him from the future and just have a relationship with his mother and John is born does not have the right logic behind him at all.

This movie is in no way touching or anything else like that as the back cover would make you believe. The plot. There is some kind of plot but mostly it's just there so that we can get to the special effects. And finally the acting. The acting is ATROCIOUS. The John O' Connor kid is so amazingly bad that I muted this movie every time he started talking. A high-pitched kid swearing and trying to act big and bad is the last thing I am entertained by. Arnold Schwarzzeneger and John O' Connor's mother put on performances not quite as bad as the kid but close. I do not see how anyone could like this movie, but apparently some people do.

The dumb thugs, the violent bikers, the suffering police, everyone played their part perfectly. If it was possible for any film to surpass its original. Its this. The fight scenes were perfect and while not too heavy on the gore, the shocks are delivered very well, incuding one characters death, pinned to a fridge. Nasty. Also watch out for the brilliant Cyberdine building fight. Pity Dyson is killed. Ahh... well. He was a good actor. All in all, a brilliant sci-fi action thriller. A must see for any action fan.

The fighting I thought was great, seeing on in the first movie it is a machine vs. human while in this one it is a liquid metal terminator vs a T-101. I love how Arnold was not to buffed up for this movie. It made him more human and relatable to the audience. Please check this movie out then you will agree.

918,3 February 2002,Funky A,8, A really good Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.,"I am not usually the kind of person who likes an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, but Terminator 2 is very entertaining. First of all, there is a plot and it is not bad. We are not talking about the best plot ever seen in a movie, but Terminator 2 has a storyline that touches many classic Science-Fiction themes like time-travel and the war between machine and man in interesting ways. Also, Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect as a robot. You know, he has never been the kind of actor who can show a great range of subtle emotions but the part of a robot is perfect for him. He is a killing machine, and he looks STRONG. And when John Connor tells him to never kill humans, the way he ""handles"" the order is really good. But even more impressive than the Terminator himself is T-1000. I mean, few movie vilains are as dangerous as he is, and few survive as many harsh treatments has he does. And this is where the incredible special effects come play a role in the quality of this movie. These effects are creative and still credible after more than 10 years. Sometimes, computer-generated special effects do not age very well but those in Terminator 2 are still impressive today. This is an accomplishment. Linda Hamilton is not the most convincing actress ever and it is no different in T2 but she doesn't ruin the movie. Some of the things the script makes her say are really stupid but she is not the most important character in the movie. T2 is about those two robots from the future and they don't dissapoint. The action scenes are good and on the whole, the movie is a really entertaining big-budget blockbuster. And as a bonus, it has a better story than your average action movie.",

Wow. Well you know I love this film based on what I just said, but why? First of all, Robert Patrick and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Robert Patrick practiced not blinking while he shot guns and all the scenes of him running fast were actually him. He did so many insane things just to help this film out even though it already had such a perfect cast. Sarah Connor is such a good character and Linda Hamilton is a great actor. Lastly, of course, there is Arnold Schwarzenegger. He is such a good actor and I love a lot of movies he is in, and this and terminator 1 are his greatest performances EVER. I made that whole paragraph just talking about the acting, so I will shorten the rest of this review. The action is next level, I love when movies mix sci-fi and action. Lastly I want 1 hour to talk about the brilliant scene that is Sarah's dream, it is so well acted and she seems so genuinely freaked out. This scene feels like you are watching a horror movie and it is the second most memorable moment in the film (Of course beaten by the ending which I wont spoil if you didn't listen to the spoiler warning)",
923,21 September 2008,Drew48,9," I need your boots, your clothes, and your motorcycle.","TERMINATOR 2 DVD true beauty of TERMINATOR 2 is its undying loyalty and respect for its predecessor, made some eight years before. Even though there was such a gap in time, Cameron remained faithful to his original production, which translates into a seamless and believable sequel. The T-800 machine, the nemesis in the original ""Terminator,"" returns, only this time the cyborg has been programmed to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong), now a pre-adolescent. And once again, Schwarzenegger was made for the role of the T-800: a stoic, hulking, violent killing machine, yet this time, Arnold brings a discreet sense of humor and compassion to the part. Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, young mother of John, but now she's buffed and tough and ready to fight back. And Robert Patrick is exceptional as the advanced T-1000 Model, the machine programmed to kill John--a machine so advanced it makes the T-800 look like an old Commodore PC. The action, the effects, the story, is spellbinding, but again, the subtle and not-so-subtle parallels to the original ""Terminator"" are what impressed me the most. Highly recommended for fans of Arnold, the Terminator, and Science Fiction movies. Gunner II January, 2008",

Intense action and Filming make this one of the best action flicks......T2 is One of the Greatest Sci Fi Flicks of all time, forget Star Wars and other movies for the kiddies that take place in a fantasy land, this movie is different for that reason, its not all that impossible, its what makes that opening scene so scary. A world where thermonuclear warfare has left the world black and macheines have risen from the ashes of that fire and have now begun a war against humanity. This is hands down one of Cameron's Best Films, Forget Titanic, this movie was his masterpiece. Hamilton is great, and the action is intense, to really aprechiate this movie, I recommend you see the Director's Cut, It contains scenes that make the movie whole and complete again, I highly recommend you also see the scenes that were removed from the final movie. One of Arnold's best movies too, He's been in quite a few movies, many bad, but this really his defining role, in the first one he was the bad guy, but its such a shame they made such a terrible third movie, T3 was such a letdown, don't waste your time with that waste of film, stick with the last two and you'll be OK.",

930,29 September 2017,theterminator-92378,9, A amazing follow up to the James Cameron classic,The Terminator was a smash hit when it was released so by the time that Judgement day came out fans were looking forward to more from the series and see more action than before. Arnold Schwarzenegger was yet again the star of the series and proved that being a gun welding cyborg from the future was pretty awesome and we got the return of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Conner who was more Awesome than she was before and was outstanding and we got a new comer to T2 Edward Furlong who was John Conner and he was amazing as a new child actor with some outstanding scenes with Arnie's terminator and made a real bond with him. The Villain the T-1000 was played by Robert Patrick and he brought a new challenge to our heroes as they were trying not to be killed and it worked. T2 will always be my favorite Terminator movie and while it did better than the original i hold both very close to me and each will both just be really great movies that i will always enjoy.,

Undoubtedly, the pinnacle of Schwarzenneger's career.  It's a techno-freaks dream of a film: guns, robots, car(bike) chases.  The effects ARE fabulous, but the score puts more than fear into you.

Many people will be quick to criticize the originality and authenticity of the storyline but I ask you this, how many films has T2 borrowed ideas from? Only one, The Terminator. It is not a remake of an already great film, it is one of those films which achieves the rarest of cinematic feats. It is a sequel superior to the original. Unlike it's predecessor it provides a good subplot(the quest to prevent the war) lacking from the original. This is indeed a human story. Cameron is potrayed as a genius as he directs the ground breaking action sequences with the precision of a professional machinist and Robert Patrick's performance is brilliant and chilling. Along with ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" ""Terminator 2"" was one of the few movies to truly entrance and frighten me as it is more of a thriller than sci-fi movie. The ending is also anti-Hollywood and can bring a tear to the most savage of critics. Sadly, this movie which ""set the standard for the 90's"" has only fuelled directors notion that special effects sell movies better than solid storytelling and acting. It is these which they should focus on. Terminator 2 has  it all.",

I liked the relationship between the boy and the terminator so it was funny that he wanted to teach the robot how to smile and stuff like that. It's a good movie for everyone to watch. I would watch it over and over again, I guess. Maybe every 6 years or something. I learnt English phrases from this movie like ""I'll be back"" and ""Asta la Vista, baby.""

It had bent the rules of the genre, but this second installment of the series, after a twist-filled beginning, fell back on Hollywood clichés. Like the machine that knew not human emotions. How original. Why didn't they run Shortcut instead - No. 5 was much cuter! Then there's the misogynist streak, where the boy puts the mother in her place. Reminds you of Jesus, doesn't it? Then, you get the ""scientists are the problems"" speech. We all know that the H-bomb wasn't used, so why bring it into the picture? Why not discuss the fact that the only time nuclear weapons were used, it was used by America to intimidate the commis (not the Japanese) in a war started by a nation that revered their king as God (yes, the Japanese). In other words, religion, not science, started the Asian theater of combat. Why not talk about that?

But this time his mission is to stop an even deadlier Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), made entirely of shape-shifting liquid metal and determined to kill young John Connor (Edward Furlong), the future leader of the human resistance. Sarah, John, and the Terminator counter by going after the scientist responsible for developing Skynet, the computer system fated to destroy humanity, leading to an explosive and spectacular clash with the fate of humanity in the balance. Whereas James Cameron's original THE TERMINATOR was a low-budget marvel of efficiency and speed, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is an action-packed blockbuster with some of the most amazing stunts ever filmed and ground-breaking, Academy Award-winning special effects. Star Schwarzenegger was paid in the form of a $15 million dollar jet to revisit his most famous role as the Terminator, this time made kinder and gentler against the silent, relentless T-1000.

We could infer that it was a last-ditch act before their last stronghold fell. Yet in the next two, this point seemed to be downplayed, with John's importance being more symbolic than decisive.

983,30 August 2015,goreilly40,9, Excellent sequel,"I may be one of those rare people who believe that the movie didn't suffer because Arnold's character had gone from villain to hero, in fact the change is explained when John Connor encounters the Terminator for the first time, and the explanation provided is actually plausible as machines and computers can be reprogrammed and it isn't actually the same Terminator as before. Robert Patrick does a surprisingly good performance as the T-1000 and is just as merciless and frightening and more resourceful as his counterpart in the previous movie, and at times displays a sadistic side. Sarah Connor undergoes somewhat of a transformation from damsel in distress to a formidable warrior whose not afraid to get stuck in, and Linda Hamilton makes the transition look easy. The part of John Connor is depicted by Edward Furlong who goes from problem child to troubled child in a relatively short time. The other characters, although minor support the main cast well enough, particularly Earl Boen as Dr Silberman. The action and fight sequences are some of the best and more memorable ones of the 90's, and the ending is actually very moving and ends on a cautiously optimistic note. In some cases you get a sequel which doesn't spoil your experience of its predecessor, and this is one of those, a must have for action movie and sci-fi lovers.",

If you're a fan of this movie you'll know that the extended version of this movie makes it 1000000 times better! My favorite scenes were the Terminator and John bonding. I'm not the biggest fan of the action compared to these scenes. I wish there were more of that in and not in the extended version. There are a few cringe worthy scenes because of the acting, but most scenes are well thought out, and have emotion in the acting. I was born in the 2000s, and I still find the movies special affects ok. (Accept for the scene where the T-800 jumps off the truck. Oof.) the ending was good too. I liked the first Terminator bit if that's a classic, this is a masterpiece. Terminator 3, in my opinion as a Terminator fan, is not worth the watch. It messes up the timeline. Watch this movie!!!! You won't regret it.",

The plot is one of the best I have ever seen, the acting is amazing and the visual effects are incredible.When my dad was always saying how good the terminator movies were, I never really listened to him. Because they were old movies, I thought they would suck. However, the movie was way better than any movie I had seen recently. The best visual effect in the movie is the way T-1000 blends in with the checkerboard floor in the mental institution.",

I have seen this movie before and I still feel the tension in the action, I still feel scared for the characters, despite knowing what will happen because the fight scenes are that good. But, even more than that, it's the characters that make it so special. Watching this kid, John Conner's and just how human, or should I say, how much of a kid he is despite being raised to be a tough military leader basically from birth and having his mom get sent to a psych ward and his dad being from the future and therefore not knowing him. You actually get to see how this affects him and how important it is to him to have the closest thing he has had to a father figure who happens to be a killing machine from the future sent to protect him. There's also Sarah who isn't handling any of the news of Judgement Day well at all. She has nightmares about it and is obsessed with ensuring it never happened to the point of attempting to kill the man who made it all possible. It's one of the best action movies ever for a good reason. If you haven't seen it yet, please do yourself a favor and check it out. I don't even like action movies, but I love this. Heck, my mom who also doesn't like action movies loves this. It is that good that people who don't like this genre like this movie.",

This is fantastic !,
1000,11 December 2002,Valenzio,10, uncut version,today I have seen the uncut version of T-2 it is 13 minutes longer as the normal one and includes 5-6 new scenes I find there are 2 scenes which are very important but the others are not so well made but with this new version some question were answered for example: why T-800 could smile or even better why he could learn more things about human nature (they open his brain and change the settings off the brain) but the most important question was why the T-1000 wants that Sara Connor calls to John. why does he ( t-1000 )not morph to sara and call for him self well that question is finally answered because after he gets frozen and then melt together again his functions are not so perfect anymore that is why he does not morph into sara but I find t-2 is the best movie ever and those who give him a 0 are cherks because they have no idea what a good film is,

1002,30 June 2005,GavAnderson,6, Cameron's masterpiece!,"Well what can I say? Good action, fun car chases, lot of explosions, good acting, and great music. All in all it's a very good film but threes no way I could ever say its better than the original. T2 takes all the elements that made the first Terminator a great film and enhances them with amazing special effects and out of this world action. However, it lacks the dark quality that filled the first, which is a bit of a let down but one that's easily forgotten. If you're an action fan you cant find much better, it really has set the standard for all action films to follow, it is a genuinely enjoyable experience. Cameron has done a great job in bringing the story back to life for the sequel, and I especially liked the fact that he kept the original cast. However, I can never forgive that ending, it was horrible! They really did drag it out for everything it was worth and it just seem cheesy to me. Even despite this, it is still a great movie and one of the greatest action films out there. The special effects still look just as brilliant and ground breaking today as they did in 1991, and the cast is simply amazing (Edward Furlong especially). It may not be better then the original but it sure doesn't disappoint.",
1003,17 May 2003,GabyMR,9, Wow!!!,"This is one of the most extraordinary action movies I have watched. The story is extraordinary, the scenes are great and the performance of all the actors is magnificent. It was interesting to see like the characters had changed since Terminator I. Now, Arnold Schwarzenegger character is good, Sarah (Linda Hamilton) is not more an sweet girl. Not, she´s obsessed with the future war. In T2, we know John (Edward Furlong), the Sarah´s and Kyle (T1) child. He´s an rebel teenage, who is fond of The Terminator (and vice versa). We can don´t forget T-1000 (Robert Patrick), the ""bad guy"" (well, the bad robot :- )). Well, if you like the action movies and you haven´t watched Terminator 2: It´s time to see it.",

1009,13 December 2011,os_rox,10, My Favorite Movie Of All Time (beware Spoilers ahead),"Not very often does a sequel manage to surpass the original this is one of those times.Quite simply put never, will Cinema witness a better example of Sci Fi and Action brilliance a true masterpiece.I watched this movie for the first time when I was around 7 years old almost 12 years and over 150 viewings on each viewing still manages to send shivers down my spine. While many people credit Jurassic Park as the movie that revolutionized CGI and modern SFX I beg to differ T2 came out in 1991 2 full years before JP and the effects were just as good if not better I mean the scenes featuring the liquid metal T 1000 seem realistic even today.The action scenes are are Incredible the chase scene between the T 800 (Arnold) the T 1000 and John is one of the best and most exciting chase scenes period, my personal favorite is the Cyberdyne systems heist . The score is great and the Cinematography breath taking.What truly makes this movie this amazing is not its action or its visual brilliance, its the direction and writing and performances.Granted it had a huge budget but credit must be given where it is due one cant help but admire and revere James Cameron after viewing this,he is one of the true legends of Hollywood and this is his greatest cinematic achievement not Avatar or Titanic, from the beginning to end there isn't a single dull moment and the story that unfolds is astonishing . Linda Hamilton was amazing as usual its a shame that she was offered very few good roles after this as after witnessing her amazing transformation from Sarah Connor in T1 to Sarah Connor in T2 I must say that she had the potential to be one of the greats of Hollywood, Robert Patrick gave a power packed performance and Edward Furlong at such a young age gave a splendid performance but the best performance was given by Arnold Schwarzenegger some will argue that the role was tailor made for him but still he executes it with terrific brilliance even in the emotional scenes like the final scene where a tearful John orders him not to go an he defies his order and tells him that now he knows why humans cry (another example of great writing), spectacular . Its a movie for all ages and Races if u haven't watched it yet do watch it ASAP if you have then watch it again to refresh all of your great memories of this cinematic Masterpiece. 2 Thumbs up(if only I had more thumbs).",

1012,18 February 2010,walta_burge,5, terminator 2 judgment day,"Well, what can I say... James Cameron has done it again, with a brilliant photographic display, as usual. The plot however, is very derivative of Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Butter Bean"", from 1965, which also incorporates the machine-vs-human element. All that aside, this film is a lot of fun to watch. The scene where John Voight throws the noodles across as a weapon in the Asian restaurant and wipes out 5 Asian impostors is a classic, and should not be missed. Arnold's pick-up lines when he goes into Hooters, such as ""Where is the manager?"" and ""You can hold my gun anytime bitch"" are both misogynistic and hilarious at the same time. Other than that, the plot lacks direction, the special effects are superb, but the ending leaves a lot to be desired. The final quote - ""We are who we say we aren't, and everything else is a monstrous pig"" doesn't make any sense at all, especially when Sarah Connor is quoting that against the backdrop of a naked Timothy Dalton fading in the background in flames. Much fun to watch though with a large bag of popcorn.",

1014,24 June 2014,shaggy_remiza,10," 90's classic, best off","Every 90's kid will always remember this movie. Classic fight between good and evil. Having failed, in Cameron's impressive original, to prevent the birth of future resistance leader John Connor, the machines running the world in 2029 again send a cyborg to our era to kill him off as an unruly LA teenager (Furlong). Again, too, the resistance responds by sending the boy a protector: a T800 cyborg (Schwarzenegger) physically identical to the one which formerly laid siege to John's mom Sarah (Hamilton). That Arnie is now a good guy is one twist; the other is that he's the underdog, since the T1000 (Patrick) despatched by the machines is far more sophisticated, constructed from liquid steel so that it can adopt the appearance of anyone or anything it chooses. The film is much the same as its predecessor, except that the effects are more spectacular, there's a lumbering anti-nuke subtext, and the script's good-natured wit is undercut by the sentimentality of Arnie's becoming a caring cyborg. Structured as a simple chase, the story sags midway, but the first hour and last 30 minutes display an enjoyably relentless bravura.",

Which it isn't that surprising considering who's behind it.
When The Terminator first came to light in 1984 and became such a massive sleeper hit, it was inevitable that a sequel would eventually get made. And who better to do it than the man who came up with the idea and directed the first one. But being James Cameron who he is, in always wanting to push the envelope when it comes to groundbreaking filmmaking, he delivered, what was at the time, the most expensive and one of the most technically challenging movies of the 90s. With a strong cast, script, state of art visual and practical effects and a wonderful score by Brad Fiedel to match, we're given the ultimate masterclass in how to make a Sci-fi movie and, in the case of this franchise, something that would never be repeated again. In my humble opinion, this is how the Terminator movies should have ended. All the rest is just commercial fodder.",
1028,1 May 2016,ajpeck-86566,10, The Impact This Movie Has Left On Me is Amazing,"Oh my goodness. This movie is one of the greatest sic-fi flicks out there. Better than any other Terminator movie, Arnold Schwarzzeneggar has molded the Terminator from an evil, heartless, cold, murderous villain to a hero who had started to learn human feelings with the help of John Connor. Robert Patrick's portrayal of the T-1000 was the best I've ever seen. Cold, heartless, calculating, the T-1000 would stop at nothing to defeat the Terminator and kill young John Connor. This film alone has spawned Terminator another 3 movies, a theme park attraction at Universal Studios parks, merchandise, and millions of dollars for James Cameron. The action was some of the best gun-play I have ever seen, only being trumped by Deadpool, the car chases are the best in cinema history, and the demise of the T-1000 was the most dramatic yet impacting death in my life. It was upsetting, however, to see Arnold's T-800 sacrificing himself to stall Judgement Day. There was also a lesson to be taught here - no fate but what we make for ourselves, meaning, only you decide how your life plays out. This lesson still stays with me today. In conclusion, this movie is well deserving of its 10 rating. This is Arnold at his prime in his acting career. This was the best sci-fi movie I have ever watched.",

It has great effects, it is very well directed and appart from the story it brings out the problem of people understanding their selves, people killing their selves and the funny thing is that if a robot can understand human beings, why can't we understand ourselves? That's a good one but Cameron's intention was to make a big-bucks film. The whole ""philosophy"" really is there but it is covered by tons of bullets and loads of Shwargeneger!

The extra fifteen minutes vastly improve the movie (possibly with the exception of the dream sequence where Michael Biehn appears again).  The absolute WORST deletion was the glitches in the T-1000 after being frozen and thawed.  They add less than a minute to the movie. Without the glitches he looks like he's just walking more slowly simply to be dramatic: the old ""good guys are *just* out of reach"" routine.  With the glitches shown, we understand that the T-1000 is not all powerful and that the drama of the continuing chase is more believable.  Some of the other deleted moments, like Arnie learning to smile are wonderful...and I just wonder what editors think of audiences?

The terminator as he's called, hilariously played by Arnold Schwarzenegger turns up out of the blue, stark naked but ready for action. After callously beating up a group of friends in a bar, stealing their clothes and motorbike he's off to find his mentor John. John who is abnormal, mentally bullies the terminator whilst also teaching him some childish phrases. The relationship takes an unexpected twist with the arrival of a further robot however this one is intent on harming John. Slowly we learn of John's unusual up bringing and we also meet his mother, who is a thin maniac. After several hilarious attempts at John's life both robots begin to see John in a different light leading to a confrontation at some kind of foundry, the terminator sacrificing himself, wrongly seeing himself as responsible for the deaths of John's foster parents. Full marks to both robots for making this a cracking yarn and taking the attention off John who was frankly annoying.",

This movie has time travel and a robot protagonist and gets it all right. Time travel isn't complicated or a big point of the movie. The terminators humanisation so subtle that when he terminates himself you have developee feelings for the character. And dont forget the movie is essentially a 29 year old mother looking after her 13 year old son. This movie has a lot of the right values I hope future A.I. will learn from it,

The evolution of Sarah Connor, and the results of how that led John Connor to behave, down to the end where he himself changed was some of the best writing I've ever seen in a movie. And how they were able to turn him into a dislikable evil being in the first one, to where I cried when he died in the second one impressed me. The story telling of the fate thing really is deeper than most people see upon first viewing, but it definitely elevates the gravity of the situation.

Not alot of acting is needed because most of the movie is shooting, assaulting, stabbing, exploding and chasing. The only question is how will the protagonists defeat the seemingly indestructible foe. The Arnold terminator is the real asset of this film as the stoic machismo hero so often present in his action films. Special effects and pyrotechnics are the non human forte. It is modern day wild west. Especially early in the film, John and Sarah Conner don't evoke much sympathy other than the fact that they will save the world 40 or so years down the road. But you have to wonder how the delinquent thief John will ever grow up to be a messiah. Placing police in the role of ignorant antagonists, the film offers sympathy to anti-government extremists whether police are killed or not. With all the violence, especially with guns, it is no wonder how so many in our society have come to love firearms and associated them with being American and ""a real man."" The bigger guns, the better. Just what the gun industry and the NRA wanted. But hey, who cares when you make almost a half a billion dollars on one film.",

Terminator 2 expanded on the concept hugely, and for once a massively bigger budget had only a positive effect on the film. The special effects in 1991 were ideal - not too cheap or understated, but also not too overblown or all-encompassing as they usually are today. Because of this, and the enormous attention to detail with which Cameron directed, T2 looks fantastic today and doesn't seem dated at all.",

Computer technology grows more and more these days, and this is improvement of society. However, if we keep on evolving technology, what is going to be happen is described in this film. So this movie is a kind of SF, but it is not just a SF. It includes real future, and therefore we have much to learn. One thing I learned from this movie is, we cannot change the past but can change the future. In the movie, the robot comes from future to save the boy. This cannot be happened in the real world, but this action based on thought that do everything to change the future. The first time I watched this movie was my childhood, so I could have not understand those past-future changes. However, the more older I become, I come to consider this idea. By the way,this film focuses on the bond of human and robot, too. The boy grows with robot, undergoing many troubles. And I see the good point and bad point from this. If we keep on developing robot, it will take charge. But if we contact with robot with heart, they reply. So this movie describes double meaning of the robot.",

The Terminator is very different from normal people and he really does not die even if he is shot with a pistol. The difference between us is impractical and attracts me. T-1000, an opponent to the main Terminator, has also characteristic ability. For example, he can transform his body into lead and other people. The capacity is strange, but it excites me. I have never seen such a fun movie. I think that I want to watch it again for the first time.

As a standard sci-fi movie (not as a sequel), this is fine. It is entertaining, it has a decent plot, it has good effects, and it has some great action set pieces. However, there are several problems I have with this movie, and most of them tie back to the director, James Cameron. First of all, the editing techniques that he is so famous for really irritate me. He often shows 5 or 6 different angles of the same explosion over and over and over again. Why do we need to continue to see this explosion 5 times. Just move on with it. Additionally, this film is the epitome of over-used slow-motion. Every action scene has it, and slo-mo is one thing that, unless it has a metaphorical purpose (like in Inception), is really unnecessary and annoying. I understand that these techniques are used to make the film look cooler, but it really doesn't in my opinion. It just makes it worse and more irritating to watch. ",

Arnie reprises his role as the death dealing cyborg from times to come with wooden (or is it metal?) brilliance. Again he plays the role very convincingly, well backed up by Linda Hamilton as Sarah, Edward Furlong as the rebellious future world leader, and Robert Patrick as the menacing prototype killer robot. James Cameron again directs with trademark style and detail, and a major highlight is the stunning visual effects which have yet to be beaten, the T 1000 effects are breathtakingly original and spectacular. It flows well as a film, with a good follow up plot to the original, and it stays together well between the stunning action sequences, from the first encounter between the killing machines, to the Cyberdine battle between Arnie and the cops, to the final assault on the senses in the iron smelter. All in all, a true triumph of modern cinema, and one of the best action films of all time. 8 out of 10.",
1104,22 July 2003,mikenickky,10, The best sequel since The Empire Strikes Back.,"James Cameron's Sequel to his original ground breaking science fiction epic is not only a ground breaking achievement in special effects but is a compelling look at the danger of greed and the abuse of technology. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the Terminator and is a good guy this time around protecting a young John Connor from a more advance-killing machine named the T-1000 played with deadly precession by Robert Patrick. Linda Hamilton returns as Sara Connor, and has been preparing her son for the future war to come. Her performance is a great continuation of the character she played in the first movie, and she has been through the ringer for her knowledge of what's to come.  The special effects are ground breaking, and they do hold up well over time, maybe because they were done with a sense class, and not overly done like the movies we have coming out now.  It's rare that a sequel could be better than the original in every way, but this is a prime example of that fact.",

It had much more action than the first. I also love how John teaches the terminator how to act more human. The first time he smiles ( special edition only) is hilarious. That makes up for his lack of one-liners in this movie. I'm glad they brought back Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, because it's her role. Edward Furlong is great as John Connor. Oh, and the T-1000 is one of the most dangerous enemies I've ever seen. I like to see characters outnumbered in odds and then finding a way to win over something much more powerful. Arnie was meant for this kind of movie. Although I might find Terminator 3 a little dissapointing due to the lack of Cameron at least writing the movie, I will always enjoy this movie. 8/10.",

I say it back when it came out and while the special effects for the time were unbelievable I also considered this one of the best movies ever made and one of my favorites of my childhood and even up to today. I think I saw the original Terminator before I saw this one but I was much younger when I did, 7 or 8yr old. So to me this will always be the REAL terminator with Arnold being the good guy. It's unfortunate with so many attempts they just can't seem to make a good terminator movie since. That's what happens when you make a move that's just knocks it outta the park man like T2. Hard to top that. There's a lot of mythology that can be explored in future movies, perhaps a TV series is best (I hear Sarah Connor Chronicles is good) and EVERYONE has wanted to see the actual battle in the future between humans and Skynet and see how we won.",

Inspired, I promptly bought T2 the very next day, knowing it was a massive box-office hit when it was released in cinemas back in 1991.

1114,15 February 2014,VamsiDS,9, Film which shows you the value of TEARS,"People say James Cameroon's best film is the titanic, some even say its the ""avatar""(crazy). But the first thing that pops to my head when i hear the word Cameroon is ""The Terminator 2"", which I believe undoubted, is his crowning possession. Sure the whole series is based on a BIG paradox and the movie ignores those that come during its 150 minute runtime unlike ""Back to the Future"" series where everything done seems to have a reciprocal change in the future. But as per Steven Hawking's theory once you travel to the past paradoxes are unavoidable and traveling to the past is impossible. Anyway, I have watched this movie plenty of times when i was a kid. All that was exciting to me then was how the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) takes bullets gets fired and frozen but still forms back again. I am still baffled how a machine could be completely liquid without having a programming chip or CPU or something.",
1115,11 February 2001,mvilla,8, An Action Classic.,"Easily one of Arnold's best movies. Tons of action, awesome special effects, a great villan, and a beautiful score. That doesn't mean it doesn't have some problems. After the escape from the hospital, the movie gets boring for a while. But it recovers with about 40 minutes of non-stop action at the end! Overall,3 out of 4 stars. Why can't Arnold still make movies like this? Hopefully he will before he retires.",

The first Terminator watched like a horror movie. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I felt for Sarah! I thought ""There's no way she's going to survive this!"" When the Terminator went in the police station to get her and killed every single person in there...it was absolutely terrifying! This sequel, not so much. Super slow beginning, super slow and boring middle, terrible boring music during the chase scenes scattered throughout, annoying, bratty young John (even though his character improves towards the end), and after the boring, long, slow middle you actually forget the T-1000 is even there!! While reading the reviews for this movie I feel like people didn't watch the first one? That's the only reason they could believe this is as great as they say it is. There is one great scene in an elevator in a mental hospital that got intense, but that's it. Otherwise, you'll be checking your watch halfway through wondering when it's going to be over because it's that BORING!",

I personally love the first part more than the second because of some absolutely memorable scenes.
I strongly recommend to watch the director's cut (is this version I am lucky to have in my movie collection) with important missing scenes from the theatrical cut in. They give sense to the movie and to how the Terminator and its relationship with John and Sarah evolve and also help to really understand the relation with the first Terminator movie.
But no matter which version you have, this is a movie to absolutely have and to watch from time to time.",

I like this scene and more that John teaches T-800 words in fashion. No matter what people say, I like the action scene. The best scene is a one-to-one fight in the factory. T-800 looks lose at once, but he comes back. When, the red lump shines. T-800 is very cool. I never watch Terminator 4. I want watch it. Terminator is five series.

Actually, I have seen the first movie, which was recommended by my mother. I noticed the difference compared to the previous movie. One thing different from the first one is that there are two crazy men, the terminators. One terminator is the same person as in the previous one and the other is not. The new terminator looks for one guy to catch him. The main character is required to save the guy. This movie is a very thrilling. This is the biggest point of this series. We will not be bored while watching The Terminator. Moreover, one thing I thought interesting is how the main character has changed from the previous story. He kills human before for nothing, but now he tries to save human.This makes the story more moving than the previous story.",

How did Miss Conner develop into this Guerrilla Warfare Extraordinaire without any formal training, in a limited time, and stay sharp enough while under psychotic medication to stay alive for more than five minutes?  Sorry, can't get past that.  Furthermore, take away the special effects and the T2 villain gets a beat down from my little sister, he does not come close to comparing with Arnold for #1 bad guy, and in the 90's John Conner's teenage character is doing drugs not trying to save the world.  None of the story is believible, even for science fiction. If you think special effects make the movie, more power to you.  Go watch The ONE over and over again, I'll stick with Enter the Dragon.

Terminator 2 not only has the T-800 from the original but also introduces us to a newer deadlier terminator machine which is programmed only to kill, that machine is the T-800 which is a shapeshifting liquid metal model played by Robert Patrick and played very well actually. Robert Patrick's acting was top notch, as was Arnie's, also Linda Hamilton returns and we get introduced to Edward Furlong as John Connor as a child. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the machine sent to protect John Connor, Robert Patrick is the machine sent to kill and destroy and the storyline is pretty good with great character development, great acting, excellent special effects, explosions and action... 10/10",

Not only was that film provided with a great script, it provided former body-builder and future California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger with his greatest role ever. Here, Cameron expands a story that was previously on a ""B"" movie scope into a full-fledged epic that takes on humanity and its destructive behavior. Linda Hamilton has toughed up impressively since the last film and gives an disturbingly real performance as a woman haunted by the future. Edward Furlong is also convincing as kid having his destiny force-fed to him. And Arnold? It's doubtful he's ever been better. He IS the Terminator and radiates cool on screen. The T-1000 provides a convincingly dangerous threat and the film pulls no punches in showing how humanity, the architect to its own demise, is capable of so much pain and suffering.",

I could watch this movie hundreds of times, and it would never get old to me. I would highly recommend this movie to anybody who hasn't watched it. It is an instant classic, and the action keeps the viewers intrigued. I loved the acting he did, and I loved the special effects that were done during that time period. The camera did very well at capturing the moment, and the editing set the mood perfect. Overall, I feel like this is a classic action movie.

Special effects and great acting save this mess of a plot holed movie. The first one will always remain the best terminator. The fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger doesnt kill any of the bikers before he is confronted by john after he saves him. Note the jock bullies that try to mess with them at the pay phone Arnold proceeds to try and kill one john intervenes. I know its sci fi but having the t1000 was a bubk idea onky used because it would wow the special effects market. Me personally would have had Kyle reese sent back in time a second time seeing as stooping the first terminator would have reset the time line anyways. Would have had three t800s. One played by Arnold Schwarzenegger that was good.,

Arnold's best ever work, yes it's a sequel but the fact of the matter is, it is better than the original (admittedly largely due to the advances in special effects) and far superior to any of the following films, though I hope to be corrected with the new trilogy expected. Patrick's T1000 is a genius at evil and Furlong as the future leader of 'the resistance' is a boy/man I would follow! AS is himself and you could ask no more. The story provides as many questions as it does answers, but in a really gripping way, the idea of time travel and a future without fate displayed superbly. Now, I haven't enough words in my vocabulary to describe the non-stop action or entertainment value! A shame M.Biehn couldn't feature more heavily (DVD extra/extended cut) is my only tiny criticism.

Terminator kills anywhere from 4 to 35 people. Terminator finds them. Heroes start running again. Rinse and repeat).

Terminator 2 is so dear to my heart because the story line the visual affects the performances played by all in this movie are absolutely incredible inspiring and unbelievably unique this is a moment in human history that will truly impact the hearts and souls of mankind forever 💖 ♥ what a privilege and a blessing it is to witness such beautiful greatness unravel in a sci-fi action movie.. arnold the T-800 is taught ""programed"" to go above and beyond to protect human life by any means necessary, and who would have known that a machine could understand why humans cry, and could not cry him self, this machine found its way to all of our hearts and made us cry because of all his efforts to protect mankind from destroying themselves sacrificing himself to show just how important human life is, making sure that we all understand the value of human life, if a machine can understand this fact, so can we.. This part of the movie is what captured my heart forever arnold has been a father figure to me growing up and the message this movie sends out about the value of human life that sometimes feels like the world doesn't have no concern for will always remind me of how beautiful life is and that life needs to be respected and truly appreciated❤❤❤❤ the ending of this movie pulls at my heartstrings more and more intensely as time goes on the message gets stronger and more clear as I get older and understand more... thank all of you that put this absolutely epic movie together ... I hate watching arnold going down into the hot steal with a thumbs up 👍 what a sacrifice noooooo:( ☹ lol haha.. crazy powerful stuff ❤❤",

1178,23 January 2007,bigge88,10, Comments for T2,"LINDA HAMILTON RULES!!!!! THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!! I just love Linda Hamilton's performance in this film. Everything fits perfectly. Cameron is a master! Arnold is back with his line: I'll Be Back! there's no other movie with this kind of list of actors. There is not going to be another movie like this, it has it all; great actors, the best producer and director, the best story, the best script, the best sound, the best picture and of course the best movie music of all time. The greatest thing about this film is LINDA. Non of the actors can do another film like this one. I think I have seen this film a hundred times over. If I had to make a choice witch movie was the greatest, it would be T2.",
1179,26 July 2016,kolbytrosclair,10, Great hard to choose,"For the sequel to Terminator, it was 96 million dollars more expensive crazy amazing effects and also, #17 on my favorite movies list. It is hard to choose which of the films the first and sequels is better because they are both so great. Someone is always trying to kill Sarah Conner and her son before the end of the world collapses. It is the best sequel to a film I've seen in a while though also, it makes a lot of people say whoa when they see this. This film came out in 1991 and also had better effects than some movie today. I mean I thought it was very good acting, effects, plot line, and also good characters. The directors make a good choice of things to do when directing, producing, and writing the film. The first film is pretty good to I was really hoping for more and more and more action like this one but I didn't.",
1180,3 January 2020,larfieldsam,10, My #1 favourite movie of all time,"Oh my god this movie is absolutely amazing and and I absolutely LOVE THIS movie. It is and always will be my favourite movie of all time, and also my favourite movie directed James Cameron, and my favourite of the 1990's decade, period.",
1181,23 September 2006,Deefabb,8, To stop machines!,"This picture is best from action/suspense style. This is only one sequel better then first part. Absolutely incredible visual effects were being made for this movie. Acting is not best, but very good for actions. Mark performance by Robert Patrick. His character ""T - 1000"" was very truly and dangerous not only for John and another heroes of picture and also for same onlookers. Storyboard of this film is strong. I mark cinematography by Adam Greenberg especially. His work is most outstanding of 1990th years. Music for this picture is very nice. And sound effects were historical for all sound editors. Sound effects added extremal atmosphere of this movie. One of strongest moments of this picture was make up by Stan Winston. Arnold Schwarzenegger played his best role. Linda Hamilton played very nice. Here character became on of best screen mothers. But bad moment of ""Terminator 2"" is inexact of storyboard. At the end of my remark i say: Outstanding picture!",

1184,14 September 2019,jivon-jackson,9," Amazing..,, still!","In 1991 , I thought this movie was awesome. I still feel that way 28 years later. Amazing too look at, & phenomenally performed.",
1185,8 August 2015,jesusdelgado,10, Timeless,"Terminator 2 is easily one of the greatest movies of all time. Out of all the amazing work that Arnold has done in his career this to me is his best the one liners, the it's good to be back type of feeling this movie has it all. In comparison to this movie and the first movie I think one of the only things terminator 1 suffered from was the fact that Kyle Reese and Arnold's terminator couldn't come to blows due to the fact that one punch and Kyle would be dead. However in this movie it's terminator vs terminator so the stakes are definitely higher than before. Not to mention the fact that Arnold's a lower model than his opponent in this movie and trust me Arnold gets wrecked. The ending to this movie is something that gets me every time. I've watched this at least 3 times in the last 5 years and that ending always puts a tear in my eye. Overall terminator 2 judgment day is a timeless movie that I guarantee you 10 years from now this movie will still be considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time.",
1186,2 September 2015,Dana_Sibilsky,8, Classic,"This film is excellent! Truly a classic to show to newer (age- appropriate) generations. I'm not a big fan of bad language, which this movie has it's fill of and that's the only reason I'm not giving it a perfect 10. ",
