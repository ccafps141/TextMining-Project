The problem of how to assimilate returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet.",/

7,7 February 2014,utgard14,10, One of the Best Films Ever Made,"Beautiful, brilliant film about three WWII veterans and their families struggling to adjust to changes in their lives after the war. Frederic March and Dana Andrews give exceptional performances; possibly their best. Real-life veteran Harold Russell, who lost his hands in the war, steals the show in probably the best acting I've ever seen from a novice. He's really amazing. The supporting cast includes wonderful actresses Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo, Gladys George, and Cathy O'Donnell. There isn't a bad performance in the film. It's director William Wyler's best. It won seven Oscars plus received two honorary ones. This is definitely a must-see film. One of the all-time greats.",/
8,20 December 2007,classicsoncall,9," ""Last year it was killing Japs and this year it's... make money.""","Some months ago, a co-worker and I were discussing our favorite movies, and his happened to be ""The Best Years of Our Lives"". I had certainly heard of it before, and knew it ranked highly on the IMDb and AFI lists of all time top movies. Up till now though, it had remained low on my radar, but I requested it through my local library system and got a chance to see it today. The film has to be one of the best ever in dealing with the return of military soldiers to civilian life, certainly the best regarding servicemen from World War II. It wisely stays away from battle scene flash backs to concentrate on the human drama of three ordinary men thrust back into a world they have to familiarize themselves with all over again. Their experiences range from the happiness of friends and family to have them back home, to the wrenching adjustments they must make individually as befits their respective situations. Perhaps the most heart wrenching is the personal ordeal of sailor Homer Parrish (Harold Russell), a real life veteran who lost his hands in an accident while training paratroopers at Camp MacKall, North Carolina. You would never know Russell wasn't an accomplished actor of his own accord, and for his effort in the film, was recognized as the only actor in history to win two Oscars for the same role in a picture (Best Supporting Actor and an Honorary Award for bringing hope and courage to fellow veterans).",r
9,14 May 2015,Hitchcoc,9, Please Make It All Right,"One can't watch this without thinking of our present coming home soldiers. Consider the rampant PTSD and all the other factors that affect the lives of these young men and women. Some are maimed and some are psychologically damaged as they try to resume their lives. This film brings a portrait of three men who have left the same war, World War II, with various handicaps. One has lost his hands in an accident, one has become bitter and dissatisfied with the treatment of his fellow military comrade, and the third goes back to his wife, who has no interest in him anymore, who is only interested in a meal ticket. We get to see how war has changed these people. The handicapped man is the most obvious, as he longs for normalcy, yet watches as his family and friends drop into a depressed state, utterly aware of his limitations. They don't mean to, but they take away his humanity. He falls into the pits of depression, almost driving away the one who loves him most. The other two wrestle with their own demons. This is beautifully presented in a subtle way, without being maudlin. Of course, Hollywood requires a sappy ending. Still, the rest of the movie, including the great Hoagie Carmichael as a piano playing bar owner, stands on its own merit. I hadn't seen this movie in nearly forty years and it was a delight.",w

An incredibly emotional film to watch, especially as stories of this kind continue to play out today wherever warfare's been invoked.

Now, I have watched in its entirety without interruption several times, and I realize what I always suspected. This movie is a masterpiece.

19,12 November 2021,tavm,10, The Best Years of Our LIves is the perfect movie to watch on Veterans' Day,"Before I review the movie proper, I have to first acknowledge two players that were in both this and fellow 1946 Best Picture Oscar nominee It's a Wonderful Life (my all-time favorite): Charles Halton who was Mr. Carter, the bank examiner in IAWL was a banker named Prew here, and Harry Cheshire who was Dr. Campbell there is a Minister at Wedding here. Okay, this is just only my second time watching this film and both times it was during Veterans' Day. So it's a very touching story of three former military men coming home to a much changed world that they have to adjust to. Fredric March is an Army sergeant who takes back his bank job, Dana Andrews was a bombadier pilot who reluctantly goes back to his drugstore job, and Harold Russell is a sailor who has to live with his hooks for hands. Russell was actually a nonactor who got picked because director William Wyler saw him in an Army short called Diary of a Sergeant where Harold silently performed his way with how he functioned with his hooks. He's actually good bringing his emotions to his characterization as when he confronts someone he disagrees with or has to show and tell his high school sweetheart about his condition. So much so that he ended up getting two Oscars: a special one ""for bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance"" and Best Supporting Actor. In fact, everyone is excellent in their roles. I especially liked Cathy O'Donnell as Homer's (Russell's role) girlfriend and Teresa Wright as March's grown daughter who takes a shine to Andrews. In fact, while I still consider It's a Wonderful Life my favorite movie, I'm now very glad the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave this one the BP award! And now that I watched both Diary of a Sergeant and this, I'll review the rest of Harold Russell's acting performances for the next few days...",r

This was possibly Dana Andrews best role of his career and he should also have been nominated for an Academy Award. There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie it is almost impossible to list them all. The cinematography is among the best of any film. This movie is a time capsule of what is was like in the 1940's. A must see movie for any true movie fan. Some critics have said this movie has aged. I disagree. The theme of human desires is timeless. And the obstacles faced by veterans returning from war will always be with us. This is just a great movie - one that can be watched over and over again.",f
22,5 February 2007,kenjha,10, One of the Best Films of Our Lives,"WWII veterans return home and find it hard to adjust to civilian life. This superb drama is expertly directed by Wyler and beautifully filmed by famed cinematographer Toland. Despite its near three-hour length, it does not drag for a minute. The script by Sherwood features very human characters and great dialog. Andrews has perhaps his best role as a man struggling to make ends meet. Also good are Wright as a love-sick young woman, Mayo as Andrews' trampy wife, and real-life veteran Russell as a man who lost both his hands. However, top honors go to March and Loy as a long-married couple facing challenges while getting reacquainted with each other.",_
23,4 November 2007,PWNYCNY,10, Intense and compelling. Kudos to Dana Andrews for an incredibly great performance.,"This is a great movie with outstanding performances by the entire cast, especially Dana Andrew's and Harold Russell's. Although released just after World War Two the movie has survived the test of time, principally because of the the nature of the story which deals with issues that are timeless in their relevancy. This movie is proof that ""they don't make 'em like that anymore."" It is hard to imagine Hollywood being able to recreate this movie today. The audience would be able to relate to the story - who couldn't?. But who'd play the roles? Could any actor today play Fred Derry without it becoming a laughable caricature of the returning war vet? Could any actor today play an Al Stephenson without coming off as being a bloated middle-aged phony? The trouble with Hollywood today is that when it tries to make a movie about a serious subject, especially one based on actual events, it usually becomes a confused jumble of special effects interspersed with inane dialogue which veers away from the actual historical event which is shunted to the background. There are exceptions. ""Forrest Gump"" with Tom Hanks and Gary Sinese deals in part with the subject of returning war vets, but that is not the main theme of the movie. ""Saving Private Ryan"" with Tom Hanks, Vin Diesel and Tom Sizemore must get high marks for its excellent portrayals of soldiers in combat, but this movie deals with soldiers who are still fighting, not the postwar aftermath. ""Dear Hunter"" with Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken, ""Born on the Fourth of July"" with Tom Cruise and ""Coming Home"" with Jon Voight and Jane Fonda, are about postwar adjustment issues and all three are very good, very powerful movies. But even these movies have certain melodramatic features that make them rather stagy, with more focus on interpersonal dysfunctionality than on the actual events that may have contributed to the problematic behavior. The closest that Hollywood comes to approaching Best Years in terms of artistic style and thematic content is ""The Men"" with Marlon Brando, made in 1950. Filmed in a film-noir style, Best Years is far more subdued, far more intense, far more sophisticated, far less hysterical and therefore far more compelling than the other aforementioned movies. Anyway, go watch the movie.",=
24,18 December 2005,jeromec-2,10, A Great Film,"The Best Years of Our Life is often compared to It's a Wonderful Life. They never should be. Their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that took millions of lives. It is hard to know what value individual life may have. (How many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century? What a statistic we have to live with.) Also our feelings about war have changed in 60 years. We have progressively moved from thinking that war is just if the enemy is the right one to believing that no war is totally just, especially the ones that have been fought recently.",t

28,19 March 2015,clanciai,9, How war veterans never get rid of their wars but have to live with them anyway.,"The main triumph of this film which makes it quite exceptional and unique of its kind is the performance of Harold Russell as Homer Parrish, who has lost both his hands in the war, which invalidity he shares with Harold Russell. It's a story and film about war veterans and without doubt the best of its kind for its humanity and extremely sustained restraint all the way in the exposure of very sensitive and personal affairs and feelings of the most delicate kind. All the actors are outstanding in their characterizations, Fredric March as the sergeant and former banker who can't quite control himself or his bottle, Harold Russell in the performance of his life, (the pajama scene must melt all hearts,) the only time ever an actor received two Oscars for the same part and well deserved, Dana Andrews as the noble war hero who is humiliated by his wife (Virginia Mayo perfectly abominable) but has the very good luck of finding the irresistible Teresa Wright instead and at her most charming, who is so much the better, and Myrna Loy finally as the sage and stable mother. The music is perfectly fit to illustrate the moods and the tensions, with Hoagy Carmichael crowning it, while the mastership of the direction of William Wyler in his slow and careful but very well thought out and intentional direction to bring out all the best and the truth of the story from his actors probably takes the prize. The film has a number of unforgettable scenes of singular eloquence, but I think my favorite would be Dana Andrews' revisit of his old pilot job in the junkyard, one of William Wyler's most impressive scenes, and there is an important forewarning of it in the beginning. This is a veteran film for all times which is inexhaustible in its humanity and which all people of all generations have something to learn from to improve themselves with. Finally I have never seen so many reviews for a film here, but a film like this just can't have a review too many.",r

30,26 June 2014,jvdesuit1,10, A great movie which has not taken a wrinkle 70 years later,This subject has been treated in many ways and many times. But I think Wyler has probably approached it in the best way; not only does he study the situation from the families points of views which have been separated for 4 or 5 years but he takes also a sharp view on the attitude of the ordinary people in a town towards the soldier coming back from faraway places and where they were confronted to life and death every day.,

Produced by the Independent Studio of Samuel Goldwyn this film is brilliantly acted by a cast of true artists Myrna Loy, Frederic March, Dana Andrews among many others. One cannot praise the ensemble cast enough, and kudos to sexy Virignia Mayo, and two standouts: Teresa Wright and Harold Russell. I am a Veteran myself but of a later war but found the similarities of the treatment given returning WWII Veterans and those of Vietnam and Desert Storm very powerful. Great black and white photography and a beautiful musical score add to the picture. Starting with its evocative title The Best Years of Our Lives is one of the finest films I have ever seen.

33,25 April 2001,Heiress,10, The ravages of war don't end on the battlefield.,"I watch this movie every time it plays on TV.  A simply brilliant film. Three men return home from war and try to return to civilian life with great difficulty.  All three led opposite lives during the war (Executive Banker became an army corporal, a soda jerk became an Air Force Captain and the High School Football hero loses both his arms in battle)and now each must reconstruct his life and connect with a new reality.  The homes they return to, with grown children and independent, working women along with a depressed economy, only add to the strife.  It's the scenes just off camera and the unspoken dialog which resonates the most loudly, however.  The awkward intimacy of Frederich March and Myrna Loy and his struggle to return to his place as leader (both at home and at work) are heartbreaking.",
34,11 October 2018,CubsandCulture,10, Surprisingly personal film from Wyler,Wyler was a very good director but his films usually have a chameleon like quality where while good they feel like any number of other directors. I think this is why Wyler's stock has gone down over the year. But that is not the case here as it is very clear that a man returning home from WWII was the driving force behind this film. (Wyler served in a filmmaking unit). The film feels very authentic and in the details it rings true.,
35,12 July 2009,ackstasis,9," ""They couldn't train him to put his arms around his girl, or to stroke her hair""","'The Best Years of Our Lives (1946)' is one of the most powerful war films I've seen, and yet its story begins after WWII had officially ended. Too often in cinema, the end of the battle is considered the end of the war: a sweeping camera movement, an upwelling of stirring music, the hurrah of victorious soldiers, and suddenly everything is all right. But war doesn't end when the guns stop blazing, nor when the politicians put their pens to paper. War lingers for days, months, and years. Returning veterans, even those who emerged from conflict without a scratch, faced an uphill battle to reclaim their former lives, having sacrificed their happiest years in service to their country. In 1946, the issues faced by war veterans had only just come to public light. 1944 saw the introduction of the G.I. Bill, which allowed ex-serviceman access to low-interest loans with which to rebuild their lives. Post-traumatic stress disorder in soldiers had previously only been explored in the film noir 'The Blue Dahlia (1946).'",

I had missed catching this iconic flick several times on TCM and finally caught up with it. I had feared it might be somewhat of a soap opera, but it is an exemplar of the type of film that is able to make the viewer care very deeply about the characters portrayed. The bond that is clearly shown between the three central characters - men who had not previously known each other, either at home or during the war - shows us what a powerful bonding experience fighting for one's country is. They clearly ""know"" each other in a way that transcends geography and class. In a certain way this movie tells us more about WWII than many of the overtly action flicks.",

41,1 August 2021,nickenchuggets,10, Wyler's post-war masterpiece,"Being one of the most critically acclaimed and important movies ever made, the backstory of The Best Years of Our Lives is arguably just as interesting as the movie's plot. Director William Wyler had served in europe during the war against germany and was dismissed from the military after he returned from a flying mission one day without his hearing. Wyler was very concerned when several days later, his hearing didn't return. His doctors couldn't understand it. He now realized he was in serious trouble and his directing career might even be brought to an end. Best Years is interesting because it's a film Wyler didn't even realize he was going to make at all. By the time filming started, he had a little hearing back, but it wouldn't return fully for the rest of his life. This contributed to him having a hard time on set, since he had to wear a special device to hear the actors as well as telling them what they're supposed to be doing. In the end though, he made the right decision by finishing the movie since basically everyone who saw it loved it. It was widely considered the best film of 1946, and despite being almost 3 hours, it holds your attention the entire time. It's popularity has a lot to do with the fact that it addresses an important issue in america at the time: how veterans returning from europe and the pacific were treated. The movie's plot is somewhat confusing and follows a non-linear style, meaning most parts are told out of order. The movie starts by introducing us to the main characters, of which there are 3. Fred, a former bombardier in the air force during the war, Al, a sergeant in the infantry, and Homer, a sailor who has lost both his hands. The movie focuses heavily on the troubles faced by these men as they eagerly try to resume their former lives before they were sent overseas. For Homer, this is made exceptionally difficult, both physically and emotionally, due to the fact he has no hands. The actor, Harold Russell, actually lost his for real in a training accident involving dynamite, and in the film, Homer is resentful of everyone treating him like an alien each time they see him. Every time someone walks up to him, they have a tendency to ask about his arm hooks and how they work. He doesn't want his disability to define him as a person, and strives to prove to everybody how he's capable of great things despite missing two appendages. Al on the other hand has things just as hard, despite having all his limbs intact. He used to work at a bank before the war, and tries to get back into this business, but it doesn't really work. He resorts to drinking because he thinks it will make his life more tolerable. Fred probably has the most complex story, since he used to serve sodas to people before the war, but is now struggling with PTSD and nightmares about the horrors he lived through in the skies over nazi germany. He eventually finds work selling perfume, and a customer one day says to Homer how america was wrong not to join the nazis. This leads to Fred punching the guy out, and he is fired. To make things worse, Peggy (Al's daughter) starts to be attracted to Fred, since she notices Fred is married to Marie, a girl who does not care about him. Al puts a stop to this and threatens Fred in a bar, saying he'll do everything in his power to stop Peggy from being with him. Marie divorces Fred, and he is once again a drifter. On his way to god knows where, Fred stops by an aircraft graveyard, one similar to the one seen early in the movie. He climbs into a decrepit b-17 bomber, seeming to relive the bad memories of his time in the air force. A guy responsible for breaking up the planes for scrap tells him to get out, and then offers him a job. Meanwhile, Homer gets married to his girlfriend Wilma, who still loves him despite the loss of his hands. Al's fate is left ambiguous, probably deliberately, but it can be assumed he is still married and having a hard time adjusting. This is an incredible movie and a landmark in american history. It does have some sad and depressing parts in it, but ultimately, it's uplifting and it simply had to be made. It shows american audiences a very prominent problem at the time, because even though the war was over, veterans coming home still had to get readjusted to not being soldiers anymore, and this was a not an easy transition. When it started to be shown in theaters across the US, Goldwyn worried audiences wouldn't sit still for it, as it is very long. However, after a wildly successful first screening, there was little doubt the rest of the country would love it, and they did. Interestingly, famous director Frank Capra also threw his hat in the ring in 1946 with the film It's a Wonderful Life, which is considered classic now. Back then, it wasn't that way. At the Oscars, Best Years of Our Lives easily crushed Capra's movie, and stole essentially every single award. Capra was sad since just like Wyler, he had captured footage for use in world war 2 films. He couldn't figure out how to make interesting movies anymore, and retired in 1961. On top of this, he was forced to sell Liberty Films, the company that had produced It's a Wonderful Life. Still, it's not hard to see why audiences preferred Wyler's movie; it's simply much better and more relevant because of its subject. The actors are all great too. Fredric March plays Al, who is struggling to understand his wife and kids after so much time away from them. Dana Andrews plays Fred, who is plagued by nightmares and feelings of dread because of his flying days, on top of having a disloyal wife. Harold Russell plays Homer, a former football player who must live through the unthinkable existence of having no hands. Each main character has his own problems, and they must confront them in different ways. It's up to them. There's also Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo, Myrna Loy, and Cathy O'Donnell playing the various love interests. In spite of this movie basically killing the career of another director I love, I can't help but be amazed by it. It depicts a very difficult time in american history, and goes to show how war can permanently change a person.",

Who would ever guess that the title emanates from the likes of the character of Virginia Mayo, scolding her husband (a marvelous Dana Andrews.) She had the nerve to tell him that she wasted the best years of her life while waiting for his return. Actually, she didn't wait, she had Steve Cochran,in a very brief part, to wait the war out.",
49,7 August 2005,byoolives,10, There's this movie and then there's everything else,"It will not be difficult for me to describe my feelings and thoughts about this film. It is simply the best I have ever seen. Fredric March(the most overlooked of great actors) gives the greatest performance by a leading man ever, as the returning sergeant who was previously a banker. In real life, March was indeed a banker for a short while. Maybe that is part of the reason his performance is so elegant. This movie reaches so many areas of human behavior, by exploring the families reactions to the returning veterans and the later relationships between the men themselves, that it's apparent complexity is in reality the simplicity of the continued struggle for survival. Of course the rest of the cast is wonderful. Including the colorful Hoagy Carmichal as Butch, the local tavern owner, who also happens to play piano. Here's an interesting twist. In one scene Homer (the disabled vet) asks Butch if he remembers how to play "" Up A Lazy River"". After nodding, Butch starts to play the song and while he plays he questions Homer about why he's not at home with his family. Now in 1946, Homer's musical request must have been humorous to the viewing audience because Hoagy Carmichael wrote that song, and the audience must have known it. Carmichael was at the time a big musical star and wrote many famous songs, including ""Stardust"" and ""Georgia On My Mind"" (which was later recorded by Ray Charles) among many others. I have seen this movie many times and only came to the aforementioned conclusion during my last viewing about two months ago. That also brings me to a very important part of this film: the music. It is simply wonderful. I was under the impression (until I recently viewed it) that the music was written by Aaron Copland. Now please exuse me for being a bit tutorial, but Aaron Copland for those of you who are not familiar with the name is considered the first great American Symphonic Composer. Leornard Bernstein, the composer of West Side Story, studied with Mr.Copland. The music for the film was composed by Hugo Friedhoffer, a familiar name in many movie credits of the era. What's interesting here is that the similarity between Mr. Friedhoffer's score and Copland is deliberate. Now whether they couldn't get Copland to write the music and told Friedhoffer to make it sound that way on purpose or whether Freidhoffer did it on his own I know not. Either way the unique sound is typically (by now) and primarily American and this is a story about America. It is what we would now call ""Americana"" This movie is full of emotion. There is great tragedy, humor in abundance, moving music, disappointment, longing for love, peace and security, and even confrontation and violence. It is human in every way. It is the human story. It is wonderful and it is the best, (should I ? oh! why not) ""movie of our lives"".",
50,18 November 2013,fung0,9," A supremely likable drama, yet worthy of deeper reflection...","I love this film. Hollywood has rarely achieved more compelling - and likable - human drama.

""The Best Years of Our Lives"" was probably the best example. It portrays various people returning home and how they have to readjust not only to their pre-war lives, but to the overall changing world. Probably the most interesting cast member is non-actor Harold Russell. Having lost his hands in the war, he plays a man with hooks where his hands used to be, and reminds people that he wants to be treated just like everyone else; he went on to win Best Supporting Actor and a special Oscar for the role, making him the only person ever to win two Oscars for the same role.

Words fail to describe the sheer number of complimentary accolades I have for his film classic. First, the direction... who can top William Wyler, one of the greatest directors in American film? And it's impossible not to mention the stellar casting of his amazing film... from Frederick March in one of the best roles of his later years, to the legendary Myrna Loy as the long-suffering wife and mother—the perfect counterpoint to a superb March. In my opinion, this was also the finest film performance of Dana Andrews' career. Then there was the inimitable Hoagy Carmichael as the saloon piano player, and another bit of inspired filmmaking in the casting of a virtual unknown and actual double-amputee, Harold Russell, who went on to win the Oscar for his first and only big screen role. Even the superb soundtrack by Hugo Friedhofer was in a word, memorable. Seen through the eyes and personal experiences of all those returning from the last ""Great War, this film successfully combines the best of drama, love stories, and events, capturing their hearts and souls with loving care.

60,20 April 2012,jboothmillard,8, The Best Years of Our Lives,"From Oscar winning director William Wyler (Wuthering Heights, Mrs. Miniver, Ben-Hur, Funny Girl), the title is a good memorable one, and I found out later that it featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was very keen. Basically the Second World War has ended, and infantry platoon sergeant Al Stephenson (Oscar nominated Fredric March), decorated Army Air Forces captain and bombardier Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) and aircraft carrier airman Homer Parrish (Oscar winning, Honorary Oscar and Golden Globe Special Award winning Harold Russell) are returning home. Before the war, Al was a bank loan officer, and he is returning to his family, wife Milly (Myrna Loy) and the grown up children, daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright) and college freshman son Rob (Michael Hall), but it is obvious he is struggling to readjust to a normal life, and becoming alcoholic. Before the war, Fred was working in a drugstore as a soda jerk, this is the only job he can return to, and he has found out his wife Marie (Virginia Mayo), who he met and married in training before he left, is working as a nightclub waitress. Homer lost both his hands after they were severely burned, so he relies on mechanical hook prostheses, and he knows that his parents and fiancée Wilma Cameron (Cathy O'Donnell) are finding it hard to cope and deal with his disability. Peggy meets Fred and becomes attracted by him, and she becomes jealous towards him and Marie, even contemplating breaking them further apart, but father Al tells Fred to stop seeing her, and as a result the two mens' friendship is damaged. Fred then finds out that his wife Marie has been having an affair with another veteran, Cliff (Steve Cochran), and she admits to it saying that she wants a divorce, and with that he decides to leave town, leaving his father with parting gifts, but he does get a new job. Homer meanwhile doesn't want to burden Wilma with his hard life, and he bluntly demonstrates his need for help doing certain things, but she makes him believe she loves him anyway. They agree to get married, and Fred is the best man at the wedding, and Homer and Wilma are very happy, as are Fred and Peggy who embrace their feelings because of his divorce. Also starring Hoagy Carmichael as Butch Engle, Gladys George as Hortense Derry, Roman Bohnen as Pat Derry and Ray Collins as Mr. Milton. The cast all do their parts very well, with March as the character who suffers terrible wartime nightmares, and especially Russell whose real life disability makes his performance both moving and powerful. The direction by Wyler is suitable for the emotional and realistic story, the most compelling of the three men of the plot is of course the poor man who lost his hands, I will admit it could be shorter, it is almost three hours, but all in all it is a worthwhile drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music for Hugo Friedhofer, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Sound, it won the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Drama. It was number 37 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 6 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!",

By contrast, this movie shows returning man going about his business, and each of the returning characters make the kind of small mistakes that make them more human, more approachable.

78,17 November 2017,sol-,8, Coming Home,"Readjusting to civilian life proves challenging for three World War II veterans in this sombre drama from William Wyler. Clocking in at close to three hours, the film has received some criticism about its length, but the ample runtime allows the film to properly flesh out all three protagonists and the camaraderie that develops between them as they meet while sharing a flight back to the same hometown. Fredric March won an Oscar for his portrayal of a banker unable to instantly return to being the shrewd businessman that his colleagues expect of him. Dana Andrews was not Oscar nominated but is equally as effective as a pilot haunted by nightmares of war and vexed by a selfish wife who believes that he could just ""snap out of it"" if he really wanted to. The best performance comes from Harold Russell though, a nonprofessional actor who really did lose his hands during the war. There is a truly heartfelt moment when he smashes a glass window and the film handles his uncertainty over whether his fiancée really still loves him very well. At times, the movie edges into melodramatic territory with Hugo Friedhofer's overbearing score no help, but it flows pretty smoothly in general. There also is a lot to like about how Wyler sets the film entirely in the aftermath of the war and yet manages to convey just how much each man is changed by his experiences.",

This is absolutely masterful film-making and if Bill Wyler had never directed another film this alone would rank him at the very top of his craft. It stands the test of time as a testimonial to our ability to adjust and accept any burden life throws at us as a country, our spirit is effectively summed up by Andrews' last line in the movie, ""I can learn."" I understand this was originally made under the independent Liberty Pictures banner (as was Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, which still sports the logo) but was absorbed under United Artists due to the financial implosion of the fledgling company.

The character of Homer is my favorite. Harold Russell was no real actor. He had no acting experience until his hands were burned off in combat and then he used that disability to help other service men and accident victims. I think the scene that gets me most is when he's in his room alone and it's night and he's looking at all the photos on the wall of his high school career as an athlete. He was prominent in football and basketball and he was what most people consider 'whole' and now he has only hooks for hands and has to live the rest of his life that way. But although he's the character that would probably be the most likely to feel sorry for himself, he's the one that is probably the most grounded in reality. Dana Andrews' struggle to come to grips with who he was and who he is now is excellent as well. All in all this movie is Americana at it's best with the worst scenarios I suppose you could say.

Fred Derry before leaving for the war, impulsively married a showgirl (Virginia Mayo) who turns out is only interested in money and having a good time. Harold and his longtime girlfriend Wilma had plans to marry, but fears she won't accept him with his physical disability, and Al Stephenson returns to his banker's job and a family who has grown up while he's been away. ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is beautifully and poignantly shot by Academy award cinematographer Gregg Toland, famous for films like ""Citizen Cane"" and ""Grapes of Wrath."" Toland provides in depth wide shots incorporating busy real life activity as depicted in the department store scene where Derry reluctantly returns to work. The scene with Derry in the background of the piano bar as he makes a painful phone call while Homer plays piano (with his hooks) alongside Uncle Buck (Hoagy Carmichael) is compelling. Various film scenes cleverly shot such as the view of the aircraft graveyard gives a sense of irony and tell a deeper story. A strong performance by Theresa Wright as Stephenson's daughter who is in love with Fred Derry, adds to the conflict. Myrna Loy and Cathy O'Donnell round out an excellent cast. The biggest surprise for me was the performance of real life disabled veteran Harold Russell. He gives a sensitive and straightforward performance as ""Homer"" that earned him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" won 8 academy awards including Best Score and Best Picture.",

The celebration on Times Square as well as everywhere else in the United States suggests a national zenith!!! America is on top right!! one thing, one agonizing and painstakingly perverse thing..The period of adjustment!!..The actual celebration ended when the bottle of champagne was finished..Now everyone needs to get on with their lives...only one problem though...they have to get new lives...the old lives are gone forever...Polite and pleasant smiles had a fragile facade with a longevity of ice cubes in boiling water!! Everyone of the characters in the movie is paraded by primal doubts, and unable to masquerade a pretense about how nothing was seriously wrong, for the simple reason that it was not true!!! Once sergeants, and generals, and their wives, and daughters, and sons and virtually all other Americans touched by World War II, were exposed to disabilities, nightmares and recriminations of World War II and what it really accomplished as well as negated, nobody was the same!! For now, social and moral issues had a self serving interest...Frederick March and Myrna Loy had to start over!! Dana Andrews realized that he should never have been married to Virginia Mayo in the first place!!! Theresa Wright has become painfully aware of the fact that she is constructively selfish!! Las but not least, the character, Homer, is about to get married and he thinks that everyone around him is as devastated by his injury as he is, basically in the sense that they are unable or unwilling to cope!!",
87,6 February 2008,olderbutwiser,10, If you want to understand the generation leaving us now watch this,"It is incredible to believe that tens of millions of 18-35 year old men(single and even many family men) left their home to travel thousand of miles away for many years to fight a war that affected the Continental USA not at all and Europe, Asia, and Africa far more. They gave up jobs(not that it was a booming time), girls, and family to fight and in 400,000 cases die, without complaint and in many cases never living to see what we consider normal life passages. Frederic March looks a little too old to have fought, but his presence and family provides a window into the business and romantic world of the post World War II era. Dana Andrews is a little old but still fantastic as the guy who gets kicked in the teeth but in the end prevails. Harold Russell is as natural as a new snowfall- most people at that time talked in a simple monosyllabic manner. Teresa Wright is magnificent, and I agree with Larry King that the ending kiss is the most romantic ever; probably a function of the time. Everyone else plays their role to a T; Andrew's father and (I guess) stepmother smoking like chimneys while sitting in a shabby apartment reading the citation from General Jimmy Dolittle with their voice cracking is incredible(I imagine that would be like getting a letter from Tom Brady or Simon Cowell now). And don't forget about the airplane graveyard sequence Corny, yes but maybe it was a corny time. If you have a chance please watch this- it is 3 hours well spent. It is hard to believe that EVERYBODY from this movie is dead now.",
88,1 February 2009,jamikel,10, Writer's Technical Perspective,"﻿Why is this story so great? Because it is lean and thorough in revealing the numerous layers of personality to our three key characters, piece by piece, which makes them so real in a paced and timely way that sets up scenes to punctuate and surprise as it allows us to fully appreciate the depth of their individual struggles that must be overcome. IT is a great example of character development; portrayal within the given story context; and resolution delivered in a surprisingly believable way. It does this without any violence (except one scene of a man being duly punched); without any overt sex, and without any profanity. Merely the use of human interaction to all the key emotions of personal suffering, tragedy, fear of the unknown, pride, dignity, love and hope, as well as empathy and sympathy framed in the simplest but most memorable locations that harvest such believable dialogue which pulls us along with each of their lives until all three resolutions come together.",

It had everything: a great story, an incisive director (William Wyler, whose other credits include ""Ben Hur"" and ""Roman Holiday""), cinematography by Gregg Toland, and a cast to die for (Fredric March, Myrna Loy, Dana Andrews, Teresa Wright and Harold Russell). Although the movie was made sixty years ago, the subject it deals with is sadly relevant today: the readjustment problems of returning war veterans. Three men have to overcome their inner demons: Al Stephenson (Fredric March), the wealthy banker, has difficulty returning to his comfortable life after enduring the horrors of jungle warfare; Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), the ex-Air Force bombardier, is now just another working stiff with a bimbo wife and an uncertain future; and sailor Homer Parrish (real-life amputee Harold Russell, who won a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar) is afraid to face his fiancée with hooks. Fortunately, each man has an understanding woman to help him through his transition: Al's wife Milly (Myrna Loy), daughter Peggy (the wonderful Teresa Wright) and Homer's fiancée Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell). This movie is a genuine piece of Americana, and one only hopes our current generation of combat vets will find the same love and understanding.",

The Best Years of Our Lives tells the moving story of three World War II veterans who return home from the war and realize that life has drastically changed since they left. They are forced to cope with the new lifestyle that they have been so far from, and resituate themselves in unfamiliar territory. The film paints a striking picture of post-war life for veterans. It is critical but remains patriotic and triumphant towards the issues it presents. I wouldn't call this a dark film, but it's no picnic either. It's a human film that brings to light the realism of the situation as best it can.",

The three men's lives interconnect after they ride on the same plane back home; the rewarded bombardier named Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), who received almost four times the income that he used to as a soda jerk before the war, returns to his ordinary life and toils to make a respectable living, while Homer Parish (Harold Russell), an ex-footballer loses his hands and has to rely on mechanical hook prostheses; his defect makes him embarrassed and conscious about how his family and friends would perceive him. He also worries that his childhood fiancé would reject him because of his condition. Al Stevenson (Fredric Marsh), a banker in his late 40s deployed as an infantry platoon officer returns to his family, but finds difficulty in retaining his old self to connect with those around him. His wife Milly (Myrna Loy) seems bemused by his changed behavior, and his strange craving for alcohol. ",

A terrific script, great direction and excellent performances by the principals make it captivating viewing.  I agree with the Dana Andrews line that the Teresa Wright character should have been ""put into mass production"".  If anything, though, this confirms that the principal characters are too little flawed and that the whole thing is a little preachy.  The views embodied in the script, that war is terrible and that sacrifices are needed from all in the recovery process, would have been prevalent in the 1940s.  They still stike a chord with me but they do age the film.  Still the best ever in my opinion.",

Never heard it mentioned in passing, had it recommended by a friend, noticed it in any way, shape or form.  Yet there it was, smack dab in the middle of the AFI list. My expectations were decidedly modest, without any big name stars except Myrna Loy (and William Wyler directing, of course).  Noting the year of release (1946), and the subject matter, (veterans returning from WWII), I was half-expecting a dated classic, which would stand up as a piece of historical interest, but not really place high on the enjoyable scale. I'm pleased to say that I was way off base. This turned out to be a film chock-full of outstanding performances, wrapped around a script which took its time unfolding.  It followed three veterans returning from the war with relative degrees of success.  Each had his own set of problems to deal with while readjusting, and each dealt with success and failure in their own ways.  I found myself actively rooting for each character to come through, even though I typically am hesitant to embrace Hollywood style happy endings. Scores a 9 / 10.  See it with less trepidation and more enthusiasm than I did.",
96,18 November 1999,yenlo,8, Three lives altered some for the better some for the worse.,From William Wyler comes a true American classic motion picture. The tale of three G.I.'s returning to their hometown after serving in WWII. Each must adapt to their new lives which have been forever altered by their war time experience. The film is now over fifty years old but its story and message is just as new as when this film came out. Two of the three G.I.'s future seems somewhat secure. Frederic March as Al Stephenson an Army Sergeant returns to his family although a little changed due to the natural process of maturing regarding his children. He returns to his job in a bank and even though he is hitting the booze a little the viewer gets the feeling that he will settle down in time and because of his war experience will be a better man for it.    Harold Russell himself a wounded veteran portrays Homer Parrish a Navy veteran who lost both hands during a sea battle.  He will be provided for financially by a disability pension and even though his life will never be what it was before losing both hands the viewer also gets the feeling that he will make out in time.  Then there is the Dana Andrews character Army Air Force Captain Fred Derry the only officer of the three.  He was nothing more than an attendant at the local drug store soda fountain before his country called.  He now returns to his hometown an Officer and a Gentleman and decorated war hero.  Sadly that's about all he has going for him.  This was the one character as I watched this film and thought `Now this guy would have been better off to have stayed in the service'  Of course he probably for the purpose of the story had been forced out due to man power cutting. ,

Was there ever a finer group of old Hollywood talent put to better use? Goldwyn and Wyler's best. Savor performances of Andrews (also terrific in combat film A Walk in the Sun), Wright, March, Loy and others.

100,31 March 2021,ivanmessimilos,10, Incredible movie,"It definitely belongs in the category of exceptional films. It may seem like a simple film at first glance because of the story as we follow three soldiers returning home, to their city, after World War II and how they fit into the new / old situation, but the film is so layered and deep. It lasts a full three hours, but the film is not at all boring or slow because every scene is important, every shot has its own meaning and tells us something. It only took five minutes for the film to buy me, and after fifteen minutes I was already completely inside the store. The film didn't age at all even though it came out 75 years ago, except perhaps for some obvious things like the paycheck at the time. Although we follow three soldiers who have a lot in common (they return from the war to their home, to the same town), each of them comes from their own special situation and also returns to their unique situation. Each of them is an individual, a unique person and lives in their own, unique situation and family. Their lives have changed irreversibly and we are following this through this film. We can clearly understand everyone's situation because the director did a great job, and the camera is also great because of a few memorable scenes. There is no unimportant shot in this film, I think that achievement is very rare in the world of film. Finally, I would like to mention that this film won a total of 7 Oscars including important for the film, director, lead actor, supporting actor and screenplay. However, there is another interesting thing. Harold Russell received an honorary for supporting role in this film for inspiring all war invalids in America because he was a true war invalid, but he also won that ""ordinary"" Oscar for supporting actor making him the only actor in history to win two Oscars for the same role.",

The atmosphere is achingly real, of the hope and emptiness and uncertainties, of the difference in generations and experiences, and of the changes in the United States. The Best Years of Our Lives presents the Post War Era and its personages so intimately that you feel something for every one of the characters.

I love these people and their inherent decency, and I love a country that was once able to produce such people. It is about three men who have become strangers to their own lives, who are quite different men than when the course of their lives had first been set. They left to protect the country and the people they love, but have returned as different men to a country and loved ones who are different as well. As they remade themselves into the soldiers their country needed them to be, they must now find the strength to remake themselves back into the citizens that are needed now. It is about the sometimes extreme courage needed to face every new day, and the heroism needed to do the right thing under quite ordinary circumstances. It is also very much about kindness, acceptance, and the way that we adapt to each other, and try to adapt to the needs of those we love. It shows the ways we sometimes fail each other, imperfect beings that we are, but keep trying. War is hell, and you don't immediately exit hell, just because an armistice has been signed,and you get sent home.",

The picture is lengthy at nearly three hours, but it isn't the flag-waving weeper you might expect; the attitudes of the male characters are bitter, and their quest for survival in ""the real world"" often aches with despair (the females in the cast are far less interesting). Harold Russell won a Supporting Actor Oscar for his work (the real-life veteran lost both hands in combat), and his journey, though rendered a bit stilted by his inexperience as a movie performer, is indeed very memorable. Other Oscar wins included William Wyler as Best Director; keen-eyed Fredric March as Best Actor (although Dana Andrews here is just as solid); a second, special Oscar for Russell for his inspiration to the country; and, predictably, as Best Picture of the year.

Russell, who lost his hands in a dynamite accident, famously wins an Oscar for his unadulterated rawness in his first feature film, a sympathy vote too since the sight of Russell ambidextrously using his two mechanic hooks alone is a marvel itself. March also won an Oscar, his second trophy for fleshing out Al Stephenson's conundrum and spirit, he can be jocose, rambunctious, chummy, patriarchal, self-serious and surely knows how to deliver a speech with orotundity. But it is Andrews who stands out among the triad, his Fred has the most complex hurdle to overcome, and Andrews bestirs himself stoically but also viscerally, his square-jaw steeliness strains to keep a lid on Fred's frustration, anger, desperation, or whatever emotion smoldering underneath his tough-guy surface, to the point he registers something far more moving and authentic, a wounded sense of integrity.""",

But I was too young to realize the deep emotional impact that my dad and mom went through to reconnect. Regarding the movie there was only I thing that appeared out of place. It had to do with Fred's army uniform. There were 5 hash marks on the sleeve of Fred's army jacket.

Fred Derry (Dana Andrews),a decorated young airman, Al Stephenson (Frederic March), an older man serving as a sergeant, and a sailor, Homer Parrish (Harold Russell), who is retuning with the loss of his hands and must use metal hooks. The war has affected each of them in their own way. Al Stephenson, who is coming home to a cushy job at a bank and a very nice family, has a problem with alcohol. Fred Derry comes home suffering from nightmares. He discovers his wife has been cheating on him and is more of a party girl than anything else. Homer has the worst physical transformation of them all. Mentally, he comes home not being able to stand his family feeling sorry for him and then tries to drive his fiancé away when she tries to care for him. All and all this is a serious look of what really happens to soldiers when they return home from war. The performances of these men were superb demonstrating openly the mental and physical realities that go along with the horrors of war. Each performance is subtle and genuine. Al's wife, Millie (Myrna Loy) does an excellent job portraying the supportive wife, helping Al assimilate to his old life. Marie Derry (Virginia May) is looking sharp playing the mouthy, cheating wife of Fred Derry. Teresa Wright deserves a nod too; playing Peggy Stephenson, Al's daughter who falls in love with Fred. This film has amazing cinematography. With the use of deep-focus photography, the meaning of each scene reveals itself to the viewer, instead of just being shown close-up after close-up. For example, the wedding scene between Homer and his fiancé, the director, Wyler, focuses on the entire room, but as Homer and his girl are getting married, we can also see Fred and Al's daughter, Peggy, professing their love to each other. This film runs a little long, approximately three hours, but is certainly a must see. The story is strong and the performances are outstanding. The director, William Wilder, utilizes his years of experience and talent to bring to the screen the most accurate depictions of the combat veterans he came in contact with during his years of service during World War II.",

""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is William Wyler's masterpiece about soldiers returning home from World War II, and their struggles to adjust, along with the struggles of the women they love. Fredric March won the Oscar for his portrayal of Al Stephenson, an upper-middle class banker returning home to his lovely wife (Myrna Loy, who actually gets top billing despite being in a supporting role), good apartment and job, and two lovely children. Although March does a fine job, he's actually not at his best here: although Stephenson has been changed by his war experiences and seeing working-class people, his character's adjustment is fundamentally less difficult than that of Andrews' or Russell's characters. March's Al Stephenson is written as if he's being filmed through a softer lens than the other characters; he doesn't have nearly the sort of conflict and rough edges that March portrayed excellently in a whole range of other movies (eg.

The movie concentrates on three soldiers coming home to a smallish Midwestern city from WWII and it walks a fine line between being too stark (blind and paralyzed) and being overly sunny (parades and public honors). Care is also taken to represent the three main branches of the military: Al is an infantry Sargent, Homer is a Navy seaman, and Fred is an Army Air Corps Captain (the Air Force was not made an official branch of the U.S. Military until 1947). These three had disparate backgrounds before the war: Al was a banker with a wife and two kids; Fred was a soda jerk, recently married; Homer was a middle class guy living with his parents, having a girlfriend next door. The initial scenes are some of the most moving where we see the excitement the guys have in flying over the city in coming back, only to be followed by witnessing the anxiety over what they will find on the home front.",

The acting of all the cast members is just incredible. I cannot imagine a remake of the film being made these days(or probably anytime else for that matter)simply because the talent does not exist to remotely approach the brilliance of the original. I have viewed countless films which are excellent, both domestic and international, but none had the absolutely sheer emotional impact as this film held for me. I found Harold Russell's role as Homer especially stunning. A man who has lost both hands in the war, yet exhibits the exhuberance for life few of us could ever hope to emulate under similar circumstances was unbelievable. Yet even as Homer struggles through with his disability with a cheerful demeanor, his profound insecurity regarding his relationship with his girlfiend Wilma and the scene where he relates to her how difficult a simple task such as butttoning his pajama top and her lovingly, tender response that leaves him, as well as the viewer in tears .

Going back to the same job, to the family you love, dealing with the same problems and/or new problems as is the case in Homer's situation. Life goes on and stands still for no one.

It was believed by many that a recession or depression would follow the war, leaving veterans with no jobs, and divorce rates went way up as wartime couples (much like in this movie) found the going tough during peacetime. Not until after this movie was made did it become clear that the economy would do well and that the GIs, supported in large part by the GI Bill, would come to prosper and spark the remarkable postwar expansion of the economy.

153,24 June 2005,silverscreen888,9," A Profoundly ""American"" Film; Dramatically Powerful; Unexpected","So many great talents were utilized in ""The Best Years of Out Lives"", the result has to be somewhat miraculous. Think of what its director, William Wyler, faced; in the aftermath of a military victory over statist powers who had committed abominable crimes and engulfed the world if battles, he was making a film that argued that the US's leaders were themselves profoundly anti-individual--that they had ""wasted the best years of the lives of those drafted or misled into fighting the war--which since it ignored the rights of individuals had been for nothing except argument over the degree of slavery men were to exist under."" There are beautiful sets by Julia Heron, Gregg Toland's cinematography and a script by Robert E. Sherwood, author of ""The Road to Rome"" and other defenses of individuals against tyrannical ideas. The ironic title was used to draw the talents of actors such as Frederic March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo, Cathy O'Donnell and Hoagy Carmichael into a large-scale but thematic drama. The clever plot line was the experiences of thee ""couples"" after the soldiers (three being spotlighted) tried to return home to a 'victory culture"". Their bitter experiences and their realization of their own need to fight again against what was happening on the homefront poses a strong and sobering counterpoint to the conventional notion being sold that ""all was well with ""America"""". March and his wife have a terrible time adjusting, and he is drinking; O'Donnell's young man, Harold Russell,, has hooks instead of hands and wonders if life can even be worth living; and worst of all Andrews' wife throws him over for a guy with dough and he has lost years, causing employers to ignore or deny his rights to a job, to consideration on his individual merits, to have even what he had before he had been ripped from his life and thrust into the arena of risk--for nothing, and loss of everything he had ever had. The shattering climax of the film comes when each of the three has to confront the need to do battle again,each for his own happiness; and all three succeed in finding the courage to go on fighting--each for his own happiness, which is now being threatened by a curiously anti-self, anti-reality indifferent an un-American United States. Wyler's direction, especially of the scene where Andrews sits in the cockpit of a mothballed B-17, alone and the scene of Russell's wedding is wonderful indeed. This is a most powerful film and a great one on its own terms, one women and men can agree on for once. Music by Hugo Friedhofer and costumes by Irene Sharaff add to its luster. One of the best and most unexpected films of all time, in stunning B/W.",

156,26 August 2021,bretttaylor-04022,8, This is a good post World War II film,Where most films about World War II made in the 40s end with the hero returning home to his wife or true love. This one practically starts at this point. Three veterans are on their way home to a small American town and we then follow how they adapt to normal life. It is probably a little bit too long and does not quite feel as real as it should but it is unique compared to other American WWII films from the same era. You do care for the characters.,
157,13 April 2020,andrewroy-04316,8, The Best Years Of Our Lives has aged gracefully as a character drama that is honest and thoughtful about the reintegration struggles of soldiers after the war,"The Best Years Of Our Lives is a remarkable achievement. It came out when the harsh realities of PTSD-like symptoms and the general realities of war were rarely taken so seriously in society. The film was bold enough to even go a step further and show how societal expectations of them are at odds with what they need. Time and time again in the first half of the film, we see characters happy to see the veterans return and explicitly expect them to put the war behind them and move on, while clearly it was both a formative experience which is emotionally important to the men as well as being traumatic and something they can't get out of their heads as much as they try. While the three main characters all deal with this general challenge, their specifics are each quite distinct which allows us to understand the facets of integration challenges. For Homer, the challenge is simple but the most difficult to ignore: his handicap. This is one of the major ways the film was bold - even now, physical handicaps are something of an uncomfortable subject rarely touched in art, and that was only that much more true 74 years ago. For Al, it's feeling out of touch with his family. For Fred, who for my money is the central protagonist of the story, it's a more complex combination of trauma, a strained relationship with his wife, and a feeling of occupational inadequacy, all of which feed into each other. One of the ways the film surprised me was in the gradual transition to the psychological character drama of the first half into the more romance-heavy plot of the second half. After letting the film sit for a bit, it makes more sense to me, as I interpret the romance as the way Fred and Homer end up successfully reintegrating. Homer was frustrated with his own inability to do all he used to be able to do, and his self-doubt made him believe Wilma wouldn't truly love him, but pity him. Fred realized that money was how his wife judged his worth, and that she expected him to put the war behind him. On the other hand, Peggy cared for him as a person, and he felt more self-assured the more he accepted his love for Peggy. Al doesn't have as clear a reintegration arc as the other two - he seems to be more easily able to return to how his life was, albeit with an appreciation for the character of people rather than just their collateral.
I love the scene where Fred is going through the old planes and goes in one just to remember what it was like. He was highly successful and was deeply invested in his job as a bomber, and seeing him instinctively drawn back to them was wonderful, followed by him finding himself a job out of thin air. I also love the repeated focus on the ribbons, as a symbol for how people saw the war as an interesting thing that happened but something they completely detach from the sacrifices and human side of the war that those ribbons represent. This is exemplified when Fred's wife insists he wear the uniform, just for the cool factor of the appearance. The cinematography is very layered throughout, as we frequently see background character reactions to the main characters. The wedding scene is an easy example of this, as we see the joy surrounding Wilma and Homer while Fred and Peggy eye each other and get increasingly emotional as they hear the wedding vows. It's very impressive for such a long movie to have no drag but to be engaging and evolving throughout, and I expected it even less from a 1946 character drama/romance. I was thrown off by the seeming transition away from the effects of war and PTSD in the second half, but I now think we do see the gradual integration in the second half as a resolution to this struggle. Great movie that has flawed characters we can root for and thoughtful, honest consideration of postwar society.",

I read one comment where somebody said that the war doesn't end on the battlefield and that is so true. For millions of veterans the haunting memories experienced during any war remains with them until they die. I have my own nightmares and flashbacks but feel sorry for those that are worse than myself. This movie needs to be remade with the same realness of the 1946 movie. Updating it to the Iraq war just might bring to light the problems that veterans face trying to readjust to the ""Real World"" after what they have done and seen.

But in combo of Bicycle Thieves, this movie tells the complete story from both sides of the war victors and losers; none get the happy live. War torn everything, even the lives of the victors. We see it first hand as how Homer struggles to regain himself after losing his hands. Fred also struggles as he has everything a decent man dreams of, but lacks any other skill that he has to bow himself down to the harsh reality of the available work. AL also struggles morally as he chooses to do the right thing. And as we see only Homer's and Frede's story closes out well, as Al's didn't really get a justified ending to his ordeal.

They are not sure what to expect back home. It shows how they readjust to being back home again. They go through trials & tribulations while they look for work. They lose jobs due to post traumatic stress. They rekindle old romances, lose girlfriends, handle prejudice attitudes & snotty remarks from the public.

Seems like when I mention this film to friends as my #1 favorite, hardly anyone has heard of it; perhaps because it's from 1946. I'm sure I've seen it 10 times. It seems to be in the top 100 of most lists I see. There's still such an attraction of seeing how returning veterans can get back to their normal lives, if possible. Other movies have tried, but none succeed like this one. The 2 hrs and 50 min really give them the chance to develop the characters. I probably found Fredric March's acting to be the most realistic, but that could be spread around especially since Homer wasn't a real actor.

The movie talks about various aspects that one faces after returning from the front. These aspects have been channeled through 3 different characters, and are in totally different lives but somehow they cross paths. Everybody in the movie has acted well but Fredric was the pick of the actors who was funny and witty as and when required which is kind of tough to assimilate in one character. But Fredric has done it to perfection. The movie could have been however a little shorter, since most of the walking scenes could have been edited and made this movie around 150ish minutes instead of 172.

Boy! What a choice that is!  It took me all summer of thought and relooking a some flicks before I made my decision.  It is ""THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES"". This movie has no flaws.  It is one movie in which each one of the minor characters part and dialog is essential to the whole story.  There is not a single part in the film which could be left out.  The young girl's fixation with her brothers lack of hands, the man coming home to young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas, the portrayal of a young man whose only responsiblity was as a soda jerk who became the leader of a group of men, and was awarded medals for his action.  A women who must now adjust to the husband who's life has been away from her for years.  The realization of the folks who were in the safety of there secure homes of the sacrifices these ordinary men made in their behalf. The look into the life of loving and living with a man without hands.  A parents first look and reaction to their son's new deformities.  A man used to making life and death decision in a instant, having to return to the way of plodding though a conservative bank's loan structure.  This is no sympathetic, tear jerking, heart strumming act. THIS WAS REAL LIFE!  It could not have been portrayed any different.  This, my friends, is HOW IT WAS!!  This could easily be considered a documentary.   In this day of color film, please do not be turned off by the black and white because it is one of the finest B/W filming, editing and directing you will ever see.  The casting was perfect.

Also Milly and Peggy were so good. They embodied the strong women on the home front perfectly. The scene when Al takes them out on the town was a favorite of mine.

William Wyler and Robert Sherwood manage to interweave the inter-connected tales poignantly, illustrating the frustrations, bordering on despair, not only of the three men - in completely different ways; but also of their respective partners who must also adjust to their return, and to their new circumstances once the war is has been won. There are some strong performances from their ladies too - Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright, less so the always rather wooden Virginia Mayo and by the end you do have some, slight, semblance of an idea of just how tough it was for these men to lose the security and discipline of their army lives and to cope with a life that has, in many cases, just moved on without them.",

223,1 January 2021,mossgrymk,10, best years,Some random thoughts from the 301st reviewer on this site of one of the top 100 American films of all time:,
224,10 April 2011,zulus88,9, Classic post-war epic.,A huge commercial success of Wyler's film upon its release right after the war and a spectacular critical reception (9 Oscars including Best Picture) are surprisingly conflicting (and somewhat symptomatic of the film's value) when one determines his expectations towards a picture that suggests post-war revisionism encapsulated within the spirit of the Classical Hollywood melodrama. The Best Years of Our Lives is a complex film in a sense that it is intricately honest about its political restraints and yet applies the same careful consideration to both the entertaining dramatic facade and underlying it social context.,

Together with ""Mrs Miniver"" (1942) Wyler has made two of those excellent war movies.",

A triumph in the post-war period, it was virtually forgotten by the 1970s except by students of cinema.

Cultural and emotional shocks for both the veterans and their family and friends is the subject for one of the best movies that describes the returning of warriors after the WWII, William Wyler's ""The best years of our lives"".
Centered around three totally different stories, the crafty director manages to cover all the angles and to show that the things and the people are not who and how they seem like at the first look. The toll of war is basically same for all three men and their families, regardless of their approach, mental posture and starting and ending points. Although basically tragic, this post war syndrome story ends with a strong positive message for the generation of ""baby boomers"" it was meant in the first place.
""The best years of our lives"" is a solid, real and strong script that manages to avoid most of its inevitable pathetic.",

Harold Russell, who was from North Sydney, Nova Scotia, is the only person in history to have won 2 Oscars for the same role, as well as having the shortest film career for an Oscar recipient (3 movies).

Billy created pictures like paintings that stand forever reflecting the human condition. He paints the good and the bad in all of us. He also paints with love. I can't imagine anyone having a list of greatest films without a Wilder film on it. They will last because they are true. I first saw this movie on TV in the 60s when I was a kid and I had to leave the room because I felt tears welling up in me and was embarrassed. Now I'm an old man and I still feel the tears welling but don't leave the room. I knew these people and loved them and grew up around them. Billy preserved them in this film and not in a 'greatest generation' way but in a most realistic way that preserved the power of the human spirit.",
233,20 December 2020,gab-14712,9," Wyler's Honest, Heartbreaking Portrayal of Post-War America!","The Vietnam War brought the issue of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) to the forefront of people's minds. In today's combat, PTSD is a topic that is regularly explored. PTSD is nothing new, but its thematic exploration is only recent. However, there happens to be an honest, intelligent film depicting PTSD from before Vietnam...during World War II. That particular film is William Wyler's The Best Years of Our Lives. The film began production a mere seven months after the war ended and Wyler wanted to bring an honest, authentic feeling to his movie. He even had the principal actors buy their own clothes. At nearly three hours long, you don't feel the time passing. Wyler, the man behind Wuthering Heights and Ben-Hur, immerses his audience into his film with a timely topic, impressive, well-developed characters, and a wonderful film score composed by Hugo Friedhofer.
Big-time American producer Samuel Goldwyn came up with this film's idea when reading about veterans returning from abroad and trying to adjust from a Times article. He hired a former war correspondent to write a screenplay which was turned into a novella. Furthermore, Robert Sherwood adapted the current film's screenplay from that novella. Sherwood's script is impressive because its honest with the terms of how hard it is for veterans to readjust themselves to society...brutally honest sometimes. Wyler was hired to direct, as he flew a few missions himself during the war. Authenticity was very important to him. Instead of creating grand sets as accustomed to during this time period, he created lifelike sets. He also went out of his way to hire a non-actor, Harold Russell, to play one of the returning veterans. He happens to be the only actor to win two Academy Awards for the same performance (best supporting actor and an honorary award). He also worked with cinematographer Gregg Toland to come up with rather impressive well-focused shots.
This movie depicts the lives of three soldiers returning home from the war to different lives but somehow connected to one another. Al Stephenson (Frederic March) returns to his influential banking position but comes to realize that being loyal to his fellow soldiers may not be a good thing. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) is just your typical, ordinary man that works hard for a living. He realizes how hard it is to find or hold down a job. Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) has both of his hands burned away during combat. He comes home unsure if his family and especially his fiancé loves him anymore. With these issues in mind, the three men must try and reacclimate themselves to a harsh society.
The performances are excellent all across the board, Harold Russell deserves all the credit because he nails it as someone with no acting experience. He sold the idea of having no hands and trying to live in his ""new normal"" very well. His scenes with his fiancé are very heartbreaking. Frederic March does a great job and his scenes where he tries to be loyal by approving loans but receiving blowback from the bank in the process is engrossing and likewise heartbreaking. On the supporting end, Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright are fantastic as Al's respective wife and daughter. And Dana Andrews! He had some excellent scenes, especially in the bomber sequence towards the end. One of the reasons why the film worked because each actor delivered a raw, honest portrayal. No gimmicks or anything. Each performance was natural, and the strong writing and direction only elevated these performances.
William Wyler's The Best Years of Our Lives hit home how horrible war veterans can have it returning home from war whether it be trying to find a job, reuniting with loved ones, etc. After service is completed and the war is over, people seem to forget about these folks-the same folks that defended this country so we Americans can live a life of freedom. Wyler was not afraid to mince words or scenes when trying to push across his themes. It is the same today as it was back in 1945. Readjusting to society while having bouts of PTSD is near impossible without the necessary help and love that is required. This movie is a moving, and hard portrayal about life after war. I definitely give this movie a recommend.

234,20 September 2014,rlong7246,9, The struggles of three American servicemen returning from WWII.,"The stories of American combatants under the psychological stress of returning from World War II is often left out of the narrative of American participation in the conflict. Here Wyler strikes an incredible tone that is full of angst and yet lives in periods of silence, handled brilliantly by a group of actors who play their roles authentically from the heart. In particular, Frederick March allows a sensitive script to shine through his portrayal of a successful businessman whose war experiences end up altering his life's priorities. Teresa Wright, Dana Andrews, Harold Russell, Cathy O'Donnell, Virginia Mayo (in one of her best performances), and Myrna Loy round off a cast clearly dedicated to bringing alive Wyler's concept.",

I would dearly love to see it again on the large screen. where it has deserved place. I can hardly believe that all of the main actors in the production are now dead. Hardly seems possible.

What can I do, I love movies about the military, and especially old movies about the military, and here it is the old in the full sense of the word (filmed before the 1950s). And I stumbled upon this picture by chance, and even a solid timing (two hours and fifty minutes) he couldn't stop me, because the topic that was raised here turned out to be relevant, especially in Russia. I looked - and was not disappointed, all expectations were met. And here's my brief opinion for you - How American veterans got used to peaceful life.

251,1 February 2022,CutUncut2021,10," Loyalty, principles, and human decency","Spanning almost three hours, Wyler's masterpiece is an easy match for the end-of-year staple ""It's a Wonderful Life"", and encompasses a far wider panorama of humanity without resorting to afterlife mumbo-jumbo. Screenwriter Sherwood's script avoids the mawkishness of Capra's vehicle. Wyler's lingering closeups capturing the complex withheld emotions, often prolonged ""realtime"" shots that allow the inner processes to surface with extraordinary delicacy. The divide between those returning from war and those who waited back home is central to the unfolding narrative (something that resurfaces in the post-Vietnam movies where the social split was even more severe). Witness for example the depth of sincerity and affection between Butch and Homer, less obvious perhaps than the burgeoning love that binds Fred and Peggy Stephenson. We get a critical sense of the loyalty, principles, and human decency of friendship and human bonding that has long since evaporated. And yet, in all its miraculous 2:50 minutes, despite the ample and excellent cast, only two coloured people appear (neither service personnel or civilians): one brown attendant in the women's restroom (seen barely in profile), and a black waiter at the party: in all, barely 20 seconds. Fortunately, nowadays there are young historians who analyze such racial selectivity back through Hollywood history, and they do well. In the 1940s when this film was made the population was nearly 10 percent black, not counting the millions of migrant Hispanics and Asians and so-called mixed-race of second and third generation.

With that said I would like to mention some of those marvelous supporting players (although some in bit parts) who also contributed in making this film a classic. Who could forget the reaction of Homer's (Harold Russell) parent's played by Minna Gombell and Walter Baldwin when he arrives home after the war minus his hands as they display such sorrowful affection that is extremely touching. His little sister Luella played so sweetly by Marlene Aames and in an emotional scene when Homer tired of being stared at pushes his artificial limbs through a window for her friends to get a better look at. The eloquence of the fabulous Gladys George and Roman Bohnen living in shanty town although none the less proud of their coming home soldier Fred (Dana Andrews). Then theres Hoagy Carmichael who as Homer's uncle Butch feels the need to take special care of him under the circumstances. Dorothy Ames and Don Beddoe who give loving support to their daughter Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell) knowing that her marriage to amputee Homer could present problems. The handsome and surly Steve Cochran an ex-serviceman himself who is palsy with Fred's wife (Virginia Mayo). Michael Hall the son of Al Stephenson (Fredric March) who doesn't appreciate the Japanese war weapons his dad brings home for him. Ray Teal who demonstrates a negative view of what some others think about the war which angers Homer. Bank president Ray Collins who tolerates Al's indifference with his job at the bank. Dean White as Mr. Novak a farmer just out of the Navy and desperate for a loan without any collateral and also actor Howard Chamberlain the smug manager of the drug store where Fred applies for his job back.

Supporting and presenting the point of view of the society does not make people sad. By adding love stories, a good story emerges. The fact that he provides information about the American family life and tells it sweetly despite such a subject has made the movie a complete Hollywood classic. william wyler is a director who manages to explain romance very well. It markets emotional situations according to social and moral conditions and realizes its presentation extremely well. the greatest example is the roman holiday. The duration is too long according to the story, there are many scenes that cut the fluency and re-enter. this may bore some spectators. It is unnecessary to wander between the three characters and to give the same amount of space. It was one of the elements that attracted attention when watching the movie. There is no need for such sagging for films that add the return stories of people who have lived under bad conditions and instill happiness. Of course, if there is no creep in the subject.

As someone who studies history I definitely think that this a topic that can be overlooked at times and is something that is not explored as much as it should be. The unfortunate fact is that lots of veterans deal with the problems that are depicted in this movie and even though this movie was made back in 1946, it still has a message that can resonate with a lot of people today.

276,10 July 2006,robtday,10, Perfection,Few films send a chill down my spine and even fewer I could watch over and over. The Trip to Bountiful with Geraldine Page is one; this is another. I'm more of the Vietnam era but this story from WWII is great in every way. It's very real; there is nothing hollywoodish about it. I am very familiar with the plight of returning GIs from Vietnam and even WWI and Korea but had no idea the vets of WWII faced some of the same apathetic receptions. I am a great fan of Fredric March and in this film he deserves the Oscar - but then so does Dana Andrews whose character breaks my heart every time I see him try to get a job worthy of someone who used to pilot bombers. This is an old film so I'll just say it -- to see him at that soda fountain just tears me up! And what can you say about Homer - the great Harold Russell? I'm getting all choked up just thinking about it. All the girls are super too including Fred's goldiggin wife but even her character can be understood though not necessarily liked. Like many reviewers of this film I think we could go on and on. This is a keeper. I even checked this one out of the library not long ago and when my roommates didn't seem interested I kicked them all out just so I could watch in peace! Great. Just great!,
277,31 May 2019,belindarubens,8, Take second look,I saw this movie again last night. I have grown to hate that Teresa Wright character. She is a prissy little brown wren still living at home. (She doesn't even know how to scramble eggs - watch that scene again.),

279,11 November 2003,TommyTwista,10, Groundbreaking storytelling,"The brilliance of this film lies not in the filmmaking process, which is a conventional, but executed, intertwining tale of the lies of three servicemen post WWII, but in the fact that this story was told at all. Samuel Goldwyn deserves credit for having the chutzpah to push through a film who has for its leads a disabled vet with pincers for hands, an alcoholic, and an underachiever.",
280,17 July 2022,dollywest,9, The Best Years of Our Lives: How are we doing?,"Surely one of the greatest movies ever to come out of Hollywood, The Best Years of Our Lives remains eminently watchable nearly 80 years later and just as moving in the honesty of its human relationships and interactions. Enjoying it yet again recently, I couldn't help but note two points where I begged to differ with the viewpoint of the time... one, Marie is presented as a ""bad guy"" for wanting to keep her job... and two, the pacifist in the drugstore, also presented as a ""bad guy,"" doesn't start the fight with Homer and Fred... In both cases these ""bad guys"" threaten the prevailing sentiment of the time for male privilege (Fred gets to have a job, not Marie) and for loyalty to country and to the military, no matter what... threats intolerable at that time, which linger with us even now. Indeed the overall subject of how returning veterans survive is also very much with us today. The Best Years of Our Lives will remain a classic of prime importance to all of us, for every reason, not just because it is superbly made but also because it makes us look at crucial questions vital to us to this very day, and challenges us: How are we doing?",
281,12 December 2002,Irvberg,10, So good you ignore the flaw,"This is one of the great ones. It works so beautifully that you hardly notice the miscasting of then 37 year old Dana Andrews as the drugstore soda jerk who goes to war and comes back four years later, when he would have been, at most, 25. But then, who else should have played him?",
282,23 February 2003,jbsalmonnc,10, The best movie of our lives,"I first saw this film as a teenager (I'm now in my 40's), and have long considered it to be my favorite movie. The story is enormously moving, without being sentimental. The acting, especially by March and Loy, is dead-on. And the fact that Dana Andrews is too old for his role doesn't take away from the believability of his romance with Theresa Wright (whom I believe is the only major character in the film still living). This could have turned out to be another post-war melodrama, but the script and cast are simply too good for that to happen.",
283,7 November 2022,ericpeterson999,10, Harold Russell is the Heart of this Movie,"What a great movie. Nothing more needs to be said. Watch it. Harold Russel carries the story, along with Teresa Wright. Dana Andrews and Frederic March and Myrna Low are window dressing.",
284,4 August 2014,blackswan-43-760049,10, Great movie and great value.,"The fact that this movie was made only one year after the world war II and it talks about one of its most important issues,which made the value of this movie way more bigger. The main idea talks about three soldiers coming back to their homes after the end of the world war II, and bringing with them a lot of new concepts and fears. The fear of meeting the family, coming back to their old lives, old jobs and to the old THEM. The fear of change either from others or from themselves. ِAnother idea is to get a serious injury by the war,which will make disabilities after it. But the happy ending of this movie gives what I should call hope. Because anyone at that time with same situation watched this movie, will become stronger and think hopefully about his new life. There are also other themes and ideas in this movie like love and friendship, that made it timeless. The acting was really good especially from Myrna Loy. However, I didn't like Cathy O'Donnell's performance it was really weak and fake. In short this movie is a great one and because of its value it becomes legendary.",

287,7 December 2022,krisbekic,10, Love it!,"William Wyler never disappoints and this is definitely one of his bests, maybe even the best movie. I enjoyed it very much and it has a really good story, point and a good scenario, actors are very good too. The only thing I am not agree about when it comes to this movie is amount of Oscars it dot. I get it really, war theme, very emotional for most of the people back then, it represented something that was very fresh and painful and they did it in a good way, excellent indeed, but c'mon - It's a Wonderful life deserves at least 3 Oscars that year. To me nothing can compare to it and it's not worse than this one in any segment. The only reason why they remaind empty handed is the theme of The Best years of our lives.",

293,5 September 2008,andrew-rigby,10, The Best Years Of Our Lives,"This is my favourite ever film. There are others I will choose to watch if I'm spending a night in, but this film is very special to me. Has there ever been a more moving homecoming scene than Homer's....if you don't cry when his mum bursts into tears, get help. The little cameo in the bank where the guy wants the loan to start his farm....what a perfect scene when he thanks Al so gratefully and sincerely. The scene when Fred comes home and sees his wife has been ''entertaining'' another man. How Fred has to swallow his pride and take the humiliation from the other ex-serviceman who's obviously doing well for himself, while HE is struggling to cope. The scene towards the end when Fred's dad is reading the citations for his medals....at that point you're probably thinking Fred's a bit of a waste of space, despite his war record. But this scene really stamps it in your mind that this guy is a HERO, just a real hero who has his weaknesses. My wife and I once seriously fell out when she had the temerity to describe TBYOOL as ''a Saturday afternoon film''. It is a beautiful, beautiful film which, of its day, was also quite a boundary-pusher in terms of the themes it tackled....adultery, an uncaring population greeting returning war heroes, alcoholism, disability. Everyone needs to watch it. Andrew Rigby",

Also, for the most part, I agree with the comments made by other individuals about the merits of this film. The only thing with which I disagree with is whether Peggy broke up Fred's marriage. I don't see how Peggy could have possibly broken up a marriage that was dysfunctional to begin with and on the verge of dying a slow death with or without Peggy.",

296,19 June 2001,rjberard,10, A riveting classic about the realities of post-WWII life for returning Vets.,"This William Wyler classic shows the different problems many World War II veterans had adjusting back to civilian life. Wyler is, arguably, the greatest director ever. He could always get the most out of an actor. This case is no different. Look at Harold Russell, who plays Homer Parrish. Not an actor, but a WWII veteran amputee, Russell went on to win The Best Supporting Actor Oscar and also a special oscar for instilling pride in our service branches. He really pulled it off as Homer. Frederic March was also superb(Oscar winner, Best Actor) as Al Stevens, who comes back to a wife and two kids that have grown up considerably in the last four years. He doesn't recognize them. He also has indelible philosophical differences with his employers, realizing he has changed as well. The key to the picture has to be Fred Derry, played by Dana Andrews. His life probably touches on most people who watch this movie. These three men who fly back home together because they come from the same hometown. Because of that trip, their lives are intertwined forever. There are also a few emotional scenes that rank with the best ever filmed, in my opinion. Your not watching a movie when you view ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" You are watching life.",
297,23 November 2008,MaryfromBaxter,10, A Lifestyle of the Past,"I also watch this movie every time it comes on TV. It has a wonderful story that seems true to life and the characters give such insight into what many Americans must have gone through when the war ended and they had to pick up their ""normal"" life. I read that the dress Virginia Mayo wore to the night club was actually bought off the rack, rather than being made by the studio, just to give the authentic flavor needed.",
