I have absolutely no knowledge of the historic events surrounding the Ford and Ferrari motor companies. None of those two things mattered in my viewing experience of ""Ford v Ferrari"". Not only does it allow the viewer to be a complete clean slate, but it provides the utmost of entertainment on almost every front.",/

3,15 February 2020,classicsoncall,8," ""We're gonna build a race car.""","You don't have to be a race car enthusiast to enjoy this film. I'm certainly not, having neither the desire or the patience to watch daring motor cars race around a track at mind boggling speeds. Though you do have to credit the drivers who enjoy the profession; it takes a certain amount of bravura and stamina to withstand the pace and stress forces that go with the territory. Without knowing the story in advance, I thought it was going to pit Matt Damon against Christian Bale as opposing drivers, but that idea was quickly put to rest. The legendary Carroll Shelby (Damon) is in the spotlight here as the former racer and design engineer recruited by the Ford Motor Company to build a championship vehicle. In no small measure was it Ford's response to a snub by Italian car maker, Enzo Ferrari, who turned down a merger with the American company in a fit of pique. Had he gone along, the end result in the picture may never have occurred.",v

Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.",i

7,19 December 2019,TheLittleSongbird,9, Rushing to the finish,"After being very behind with film watching and reviewing, a lot of my reviews this year being dedicated to individual episodes of shows, completest quests and some cartoons, finally made the decision to watch more films released this year and to finally review the films seen earlier this year but hadn't gotten round to seeing. 'Le Mans 66' was a very eagerly anticipated film, due to liking the lead actors and loving 'Rush' that this has been compared to by some, and one of the year's (quite hit and miss) more acclaimed films, so there was not any doubt about seeing it.",/
8,21 November 2019,Keemshave,9, An exhilarating and emotional ride,"A lot of notes were hit by Ford v Ferrari. The characters are fleshed out very well and give you the emotional attachment you're looking for in a movie. Bale and Damon's performances are great; they pull you into the story and completely disappear into their roles. James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails.",r
9,15 June 2020,claudio_carvalho,8, Engaging Action Film,"""Ford v Ferrari"" is an engaging action film based on a true story, when the American manufacturer Ford decided to build the racing car Ford GT40 to defeat the Italian Ferrari at the ""24 Hours of Le Mans"" in 1966.

13,8 January 2020,garethcrook,9, Stunning!,"This film is like the cars it portrays. Slick on the surface, but complicated underneath. Yes it's a story born of corporate ambition in horn rimmed glasses and dark suits, driven by pride and stubbornness, but the heart of it is pure racing, to hell with money, marketing, good looks, any of that. I've watched half of this with my foot planted to the floor. The driving scenes are awesome, the roar of untamed engines (turn your sound up as loud as you dare!), shifting gears into blindness inducing speeds. Fast cars alone though can't carry a film, but thankfully the cast here is as great as the cars. Damon is very good as the lynchpin Shelby, as he drags Ford away from mass production and onto the racetrack to challenge Ferrari's dominance. Bale though, Bale is magnificent. His portrayal of somewhat renegade driver Ken Miles is the oil in the engine, the comic undertones with a 'my way or the highway' attitude. He literally drives this. The pacing is spot on, balancing the boardroom with the tarmac perfectly, all done with some Oceans 11 style slick, good ol rock n roll blasting out as men do manly things. It's a show piece with Ferrari painted as the bad guy. I'm fine with that. Yes the cars look sexy, ""If this were a beauty pageant, we just lost"", but gimme the brute force of the Ford GT40 any day. There's a ton of excitement and energy before the cars even get to Le Mans, but seeing that GT tear up the French countryside gets the heart pounding. Doesn't matter that I already knew the outcome, it's still exhilarating with some of the best racing scenes in any film, ever!",8
14,12 January 2020,agm_tcr,8, Racing with a soul,"As a Ferrari fan I was pleasantly on the side of a Ford driver, all because of the soul Christian Bale was able to portrayed as Ken Miles, a sports car racing engineer who's hart was beaten in unison with an engine of a race car. Aside of the fact that he lose several kg for the role, but being a method actor it cling a viewer to the screen. Excitement and rage can be feel in every scene. The passion take us to the circuit and made us push the accelerator. What I miss is the surprise of the plot since I knew the story. The cast is brilliant, and finally in one Americans movie I have the pleasure to see casted Italians brilliants actor for the roles of the Ferrari Team, speaking perfect Italian, as oppose as being disappointed when they cannot.

20,14 February 2020,jordanucsd,8," ""I had no idea. If only my dad were alive to see this.""","I've seen a lot of car movies, as a self-professed car nut. As such I judge them harshly, and immediately dismiss entries that don't provide enough reason to care about what is more important than the car: the driver. Think of the Fast and Furious and Transformers franchise. If you care about the driver, and the driver cares about the car, you care about the car. The car is a tool, an extension of the hero's body, and gains provenance with the audience when it helps the hero on their personal journey. Movies that come to mind that do this effectively include Gone in 60 Seconds, Bullitt, Need For Speed, The Italian Job, Batman Begins, and The Bourne Identity. Some of the James Bond movies do it well, like Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loves Me, The Living Daylights, and SkyFall, but many do not because of the lack of character arc in the story. We cannot forget about perhaps the greatest car movie of all time, Back to the Future. The shining example of how to make the car a proper star.",e
21,15 November 2019,nickfarf-42699,10, As close as possible to the truth but!,"I was at the Philadelphia Film center premiere on 11/11/19 to view this terrific movie. At the age of 68 and a tifoso of Ferrari since age 8, ( 1959 ), this movie hit a nerve. Truth vs Fiction. This was a David vs Goliath movie, however Goliath wins. The movie recreates a golden era of auto Racing. It was seriously dangerous with death and injury a guarantee at every race. These drivers were absolute warriors and we're fearless. Now Ferrari winning LeMans six straight years in a row from 1960-1965 is actually the David in this movie. Ferrari for all their dominant winning form was still a tiny company that sold fancy $15,000 sportcars to support his racing team. Winning LeMans was a $16,500 team prize. These Ferrari drivers were salaried. The prototype class at that time was wide open with no upper limit on engine size. There was an under 2 liter class that Porsche and Ferrari dino control, but the over 2 liter was unlimited. I read carefully about the Ford move to acquire Ferrari, as daily news reports would cross the associated press. The movie is spot-on about Ford cars lacking desire back then. Chevrolet had the Corvette, Corvair and sporty looking Impala and Chevelle. Now Ford is the Goliath in this movie. They are the big corporate giant with unlimited resources. Ford paid for the Ford GT. It was really a Lola Gt with a Ford badge put on it. Ford put their name on every innovation provided by all the racing/equipment suppliers that went into that race car. Unlike Ferrari being designed, engineered and built handmade in that Italian factory. Ford spent more money on developing a racecar than the total price to buy Ferrari outright. Hired every Nascar team to provide expert pit crews, engine builders and offered 80,000-100,000 to each driver for one race . Now the movie, it's a movie that non race cars fans can and will enjoy. It shows how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the winning team. This was true. Their relationship is spot on in the movie and they know what is needed to win. They battle off the track against Ford executives and against Ferrari on the track. What is not disclosed in the movie is the quitting of the Ferrari ace driver John Surtees. When he left Ferrari, the team was devastated. He along with Ford's Ken Miles were two true warriors. Also not shown but lightly covered in the movie is the three years of disastrous outing for the Ford racing team. Did Shelby steal the Ferrari pits stop watches? Did Shelby actually throw spear lug nuts into the Ferrari pit lane to make the Ferrari pit crew think that the race car was missing a nut on the car out on the track? Did Enzo Ferrari actually tip his hat to honor Ken Miles? Who really knows. Everybody is dead. I remember the lug nut rumour in the 1960s, as that was a southern stock car trick. I never heard about the theft of Ferrari stop watches by Shelby. As far as Ferrari tipping his hat. Ferrari was known for or not attending many races. All that aside, did I as a Ferrari fan enjoy this movie. My answer is a Yes, Yes, Yes. With the exception of James Garner in Grand Prix, this is the best movie to deal with the sport of autoracing. Bonus is that it is also a great human interest story and they create the mood of the sixties as U vividly remember it. I rate this movie a ten and should be nominated for Oscars.",f

It think it's a ridiculous waste of resources, and boring to watch. I have zero interest in cars - and thus I know absolutely nothing of the history. I knew nothing of this film beyond reading the blurb before I started watching it, so I was very interested to see whether I would like it at all. I did. Despite being so uninterested in the subject, the film got me interested in the story, and especially during the final race I was on the edge of seat not knowing what would happen.

29,20 November 2019,bob-the-movie-man,10, A linear story on a circular track - but beautifully done.,"Despite the love affair cinema has had with cars over the years, the sport of motor racing on film has been patchy. Too often the drama on the track has been deluged with melodrama off the track, as in John Frankenheimer's ""Grand Prix"" from 1966. While recent efforts such as Ron Howard's ""Rush"" have brought modern filming techniques to better convey the speed and excitement, it is Steve McQueen's ""Le Mans"" from 1971 that had previously set the bar for realism in the sport. But even there, there were a few off-track love stories to interweave into the action.",v

41,21 November 2019,Alexander_Blanchett,9, A rare example of old fashioned styled Studio Movies,"A very nice old fashioned type of filme - one of those big Studio movies the Studios don't do that much anymore. One that really concentrates and cares for their characters and takes time to develope them. It was both storywise and also technical wise a true winner. The Performances were great. Christian Bale was just phenomenal. Especially if you consider that just last year at the same time he was playing a totally different character in ""Vice"", physically and also Motivation wise. Here he gives us an ordinary man with exatraordinary abilities and quite a tough mindset. He is great and once again proves he is one of hte most verstaile actors out there. Matt Damon was also good but definitely stayed in the shadow of Bale. Also because I think the characters were much more intersted in developing Ken than Carroll. And this is one of the very few flaws of the film. Another worth-to-mention perfomance came from Tracey Letts. and on a lesser extend Jon Bernthal.
James Mangold understood perfectly to Combine strong characters in a very solid Story with many great technical aspects to make one of a Kind of Hollywood film I dearly miss. Sound and editing were pitch perfect. The final race was one of the most exciting Moments in Cinema we had this year. And in the end it even almost brought me to Tears. A true winner Picture.",
42,1 November 2019,Magow-Intermean,9, Ford V Ferrari Review,"Ford v Ferrari thrills by simulating the record-breaking pace of the cars on the tracks, but really captivates because we care deeply about the men trying to make the victory happen.
Before his back-to-back dips into the comic-book universes of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and the X-Men - in the films Logan and The Wolverine - James Mangold nimbly danced through genres in search of compelling characters. He'd make a Tom Cruise actioner like Knight & Day, but add on a bumbling innocent character to spice up the routine spy genre. He'd plunge into a conventional biopic like Walk the Line, but reinvent it with the aide of two commanding performance at the head of his Johnny Cash story.
Mangold's back at the helm of a sturdy, red-blooded American story of ingenuity and stick-to-your-guns re-invention for the spectacular new Ford v Ferrari. You've probably seen this type of story told before, but rarely this well, with supreme talents overcoming nearly impossible odds to achieve a goal everyone tells them they can't get.
It's the late 1960s, and Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) faces a serious issue. The Ford brand, time-tested and baked into the American popular culture, is struggling to contend against an onslaught of cooler, hipper cars. Kids coming back from the war hardly want to plunk down cash on the cars on which their dads used to depend. Ford needs bold, company-saving ideas, and Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) has one.
Iacocca wants Ford to compete on the global racing circuit. Specifically, Iacocca wants Ford to go head-to-head with the dominant force of the international circuit: Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). To do that, Ford recruits two men with intimate knowledge of this field: celebrated automotive designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), who raced in and won the annual 24 Hours of LeMans in 1959; and Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a hard-headed and short-tempered grease monkey who has a seamless connection to his automobiles, and might be the only person talented enough to drive the car Ford needs to build from scratch.
Even if you know the results of the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans - and the outcome has been famous in the race world since the moment the event concluded - Mangold's Ford v Ferrari captivates and entertains with the peaks and valleys of the team's journey. The riveting drama spins a classic narrative of teamwork and ingenuity in the face of stifling adversity, as Shelby and Miles constantly had to convince Ford of the risks that needed to be taken if they actually wanted to win the race, and not just contend.
Mangold recruits two of the greatest male actors working today to play his leads, but they are overshadowed by one intangible co-star I like to call ""speed."" The racing scenes in Ford v Ferrari are breathtakingly innovative, with Mangold and his team routinely figuring out new ways to put us in the driver's seat of some of the fastest vehicles on the planet. The chief obstacle facing Shelby and Miles was making their protoptype race car faster, so the tests performed in the film had to convey that achievement. Ferrari thrills by simulating the record-breaking pace of the cars on the tracks, but really captivates because we care deeply about the men trying to make the victory happen.
Bale, in particular, is fantastic as the flawed and conceited Ken Miles, a dedicated husband and father who can't help but put his passion for cars ahead of the family he loves. He's conflicted by his desire to be around for them, but unable to resist the temptation that comes with the challenge of being right about the cars that Shelby fights to design. Arguably, Ford could not have competed at 24 Hours of Le Mans without Ken Miles' contributions, and I'd shudder to think of a version of Ford v Ferrari without Bale behind the wheel.
Under Mangold's watchful eye, Ford v Ferrari tells a stirring, inspirational story about professional pride, and tells it extremely well. The screenplay creates rich, complicated characters out of its underdog-sport template (though two supporting characters drag the main plot down with their unnecessary contributions), and Mangold's precision for filmmaking helps the ride stay perpetually smooth and swift. Hollywood used to specialize in these audience-bonding crowd pleasers. Now they are few and far between, so when one speeds along and is firing on all cylinders, so out of your way to support it.",

46,23 November 2019,trelerke-politics,6," well done for its genre, but only just, good acting on the part of Bale and Damon","I used to race cars, still spend a bit of time on the track, so I know this story,
even met some of the actual people involved here (I'm old), and I wanted to really like the movie more than I did. Of course the car porn was fantastic, the casual way in which iconic multi-million dollar cars were placed around the set and even some of the scenes showing the GT40 moving around the airport tarmac were very good. For the latter, they captured speed well here, which is very difficult. So, kudos. But the actual danger involved, although shown to some extent, was not given the attention really needed. I understand the dramatic demands for a movie, but I would think emphasizing the danger would only help. Just to be clear, there were two deaths in a five month period, Miles and Macdonald, although deaths and massive injuries were very common then, these deaths actually had an effect on the racing community. Also, to be clear, the Ford effort was massive, they simply hired the very best in the US to get the GT40 developed. It really was a huge disparity between Ford and any other team. In reality, once Ford got out the kinks, it was a foregone conclusion, no matter that Ferrari made amazing cars. In this regard, little was made of the genius and absolute necessity of Phil Remmington to the entire GT40 project, he was the actual development lead on the car and he was made out to be a Disney -like character, uncle Phil with almost no real role to play. Well, actually, the character of Miles, also an engineer on the project was a compiled character that included ""Rem"" but because Rem was the essential piece for GT40 development, they had to gesture towards him, I suppose. Again, it was an okay movie, very much in the genre, although a bit better acted, Damon and Bale fighting with each other, using food, a thrown wrench, the supportive, loving wife. Within the context of a buddy movie, the movie does work, but its too long and you feel it, although I did like the way Miles death accident was shown, not a lot of buildup, save for the music, and then a highspeed muffled crash, no huge histrionics after and then the both true and movie cliche line ""sometimes they don't come home."" I wanted more of the internal mechanics of that, I wanted more of Henry Ford crying in the car, a great scene, actually because both the absolute insanity of being in a racing car as well as his joy were conveyed, I thought that was a magnificent human moment, unexpected and worth the movie, on it's own.",

Unable to take this lightly and vowing revenge, Ford II decides to use his considerable resources to defeat Ferrari in the 1966 Le Mans race. And a legend was born. ""Ford v Ferrari"" is the highly watchable cinematic depiction of the greatest rivalry in car racing history. Matt Damon portrays the calm and collected car designer Carroll Shelby who oversees the operation to win the race for Ford at Le Mans. Christian Bale plays the cocky and outspoken race car driver Ken Miles whose challenging personality stood out as much as his skill in driving. Together their tense relationship forms the heart of the story as their interaction covers the range of combative to genuine friendship as they make auto racing history. Of course, there's the races, where the high speed rush of the best cars of their time try to outspeed each other in fully charged blasts zooming to the finish line. One of the most notable bioflicks and a highlight in a year that has proven to be one of the best in cinema history, this is one that will turn out to be a fave among many fans of the silver screen.",

With such a simple title as ""Ford vs Ferrari"", you'd think that it's all about the cars and true, to some extent it is, but its also about the strengths and vulnerabilities of two unique individuals who were determined to develop an American made race car (the Ford GT40) to win the 24 hours of Le Mans race in 1966. It goes through their personal struggles, their triumph, and ultimately the fate and the effects of their actions on the racing scene as we know it. The combination of Matt Damon, as Shelby, and Christian Bale, as Ken Miles, was perfect. Absolutely perfect.

Carroll Shelby, the most beloved car designer in American history, faces the music when it comes to dealing with the Big Boys. His desire for endurance race success coincides with Ford's corporate decision to get racier, inspired by Lee Iacocco (the father of the Mustang). After that it's all individualism vs. corporate bullxxxx. I think Damon is the most reliable star out there, and it's a stretch but not too much of a stretch for him to play country outlaw Shelby. Bale is also stretch but a workable stretch for the equally individualistic Miles, a Brit racer and car designer. Henry Ford II is also magnificently played. The CGI was under control, the movie ran long but not unpleasantly so, the wrap up was a tad awkward but that happens. Appears to have captured the basic facts and feelings of the true life events, for which it deserves kudos. Could be enjoyed by non-racing fans.",
62,3 February 2020,RhapsodyReviews,10, Brilliant.,"Review:
'Ford v Ferrari' is a sports-drama film directed by James Mangold.
What a film this is! I really wish I had waited to do my top ten list of 2019 until I seen this movie. My eyes were glued to the screen the whole time I was watching it.
The plot follows a determined team of American engineers and designers, led by automotive visionary Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and his British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale), who are dispatched by Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) with the mission of building the Ford GT40, a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the perennially dominant Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France.
Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Jon Bernthal shows that he is more than an action guy when it comes to his acting capabilities, and Josh Lucas might just be the evillest villain to come out of 2019, including Thanos himself. What a dick he is in this movie and he plays it to perfection.
James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails. The race scenes have the tension they need, and Matt Damon and Christian Bale bring the humor without over doing it.
Overall, this is entertainment at its finest. There are some true story films that don't relate well to the big screen, this one will excel expectations. Great direction with a phenomenal cast is an A+.

Granted, it takes a lot of courage to be a race driver. But why risk your life especially if you're married and have children?

Christian Bale's performance is a spark of excellence as always, he's one of the best actors in this generation. If I had one complaint it'd be that Matt Damon chews way to much gum but part of me thinks that added on his glorious performance. I really hope Ford Vs. Ferrari gets Oscar praise, it deserves every bit of love.",
65,15 November 2019,julianrosser-440-787839,6, Massively overrated at 8/10,A huge disappointment for racing fans ( and who else would watch this sort of film ?). No mention of the original designer of the GT40 Eric Broadley of British car maker Lola on whose GT mk VI the Ford was based. No mention of Denny Hulme who co-drove with Ken Miles. It's as if he didn't exist. WTF ?!,
66,14 November 2019,vinsond21,9, Riveting reenactment of a remarkable race,"Back in the 1960s, Ferrari's racing team was the one to beat on the track. This is the story of how Ford Motor Company took on Ferrari in 1966 and won, with the help of automotive designer Carroll Shelby and race driver Ken Miles. The Ford team constructed the formidable GT40 which emerged victorious at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Those who were previously unaware or oblivious of this juicy bit of history will find themselves captivated by its reenactment on celluloid. The film runs two and a half hours, yet it does not drag, thanks to a tight script and solid performances, superbly-edited racing sequences along with a music score that enhances the action onscreen. Matt Damon once again proves why he is one of the finest actors of his generation; he is absolutely spot-on in his portrayal of Shelby as a man with passion, confidence and determination. I love watching him in movies like this one and also Invictus. Christian Bale's performance as Ken Miles, while a little more mannered, still manages to beautifully capture the character's extremes of tenderness and cockiness. Also noteworthy is Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II; he shows that the magnate can have a commanding presence yet break down upon experiencing an epiphany. Ford v Ferrari brings a nugget of racing history to life through this well-assembled movie which is worth catching especially on the big screen.",

It won two Oscars, one for film best editing and another for best sound editing, and it deserves both of them. Visually it was all very good. The story, based on true events, is entertaining. The races add a nice little tension and suspense what makes this movie stand out from the rest. The cast was great, with Matt Damon and Christian Bale in the leading roles. Christian Bale was excellent, probably his best performance yet, and Matt Damon just never disappoints.

74,4 November 2019,mrmcguinnes,8, The Near Perfect Lap,"Le Mans '66 is a fast paced thrill ride from beginning to end. It tells the story of how carol shelby and ken miles built a car that could beat Ferrari in 24hr race at Le Mans where they had won the previous 4 years. The biggest strength in this film is the chemistry between the cast, good performances all round from Josh Lucas to Ray McKinnon but the whole film hinges on the chemistry between the two leads. it delivers on that front with the highlights of the film being scenes with Damon & Bale genuinely feeling like two old friends bantering back & forth about cars. Matt Damon does a great job as Shelby but can't help be overshadowed by Christian Bale who steals the movie with his performance as ken miles a man on the journey to find that one perfect lap. James Mangold does a good job with the direction you feel the gear shifts & the tension when the Ford Gt40 screeches it's breaks around right corners. There could probably more ambitious or creative shots in some of the races but in my honest opinion I think the performances Mangold got out of this cast outshines the technical stuff. The writing isn't the best and can come off as cheesy & predictable in certain areas but for the most part I felt it was well written and had a good pace to it. I'd recommend Le Mans '66 it's not 1st place but it's a near perfect lap.",

The future is not too bright for Miles Ford and Ferrari but unlike Miles he does not hold the cards in life.. When people in high places determine people's fate, trusting a friend who is controlled by such is not that easy. But the Miles-Shellby bond is a prime example of great casting. In the end, your fate is determined by people in suits; mirroring why unchecked heights of inequality can determine people's fate in our this era.

Their latest competitive movie is ""Ford v Ferrari"" and it's a contemporary classic in which every single piece fits perfectly into place just like the pieces of the classic cars on display.

Mangold puts you front and forward in the action, with some really impressive shots, the technical aspects alone make this one worth watching. But at its core this is a character driven piece with two career best performances from Bale and Damon as Shelby and Miles, who not only have their own issues to deal with, but also that of the big Ford corporation, and a race they are not willing to lose. This film has a bit of everything, from the personal tolls this project has on Miles and his wife and kid, to the exciting 24 hour race, or the inner workings of big business and what crooks they can be, Ford v.

The blockbusters are rare and the Oscar movies are everywhere, albeit typically a ""downer"" or more ""thought-provoking"" than something you're on the edge of your seat for. Ford v Ferrari certainly accomplishes the latter with two winning performances, sharp direction from James Mangold, and a cheer worthy true story to base it around. Heck, this movie even had some laugh out loud humor, something Christian Bale's filmography isn't full of. I would love to see him try straight comedy at some point.

126,22 October 2019,ecastrodesign,10, A big Hollywood Film that delivers !,"Once in a while, a big Hollywood film is made with big Hollywood stars, and big Hollywood production values and occasionally everything works to deliver a dynamic cinematic event.
Such is the case with director James Mangold's new film ""Ford v Ferrari"". Armed with superior talent in front and behind the camera, Mr. Mangold has directed his best film yet with bravado. A strong screenplay is the foundation of a great story involving the characters portrayed by Matt Damon playing American Car Designer Carroll Shelby, driver Christian Bale, and Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, all involved in challenging the famous Italian car maker Ferrari at the famous race at Le Mans in 1966.
From the very first frame, James Mangold sets the tone with exciting, bold and energetic images that are visually arresting, alongside a great score that never overwhelms or feels generic. The editing is outstanding, as the pace is so fast moving, pulsating with nail biting excitement, especially in the racing sequences.
Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, along with Production Designer Francois Audouy, and Costume Designer Daniel Orlandi, have created a rich canvas, always authentic in feel, full of subtleties resulting in a formidable palette that comes together beautifully.
Flawless performances are a high point under the guidance of James Mangold's direction. Matt Damon has rarely had the opportunity to show quite a range from confidant showman to a vulnerability we rarely see. Christian Bale as always disappears into his character and delivers another stellar performance, and Tracy Letts layers his performance with strength and flair.
Ultimately, James Mangold's master work delivers on all fronts, and on the whole one of the most satisfying films of the year, and certain to be a major contender for many well deserved awards !",

He is probably the most underrated Director working right now. He can pretty much do any genre and it's good.

The racing scenes are exhilarating, and the men are driven by testosterone and compelled to be the best. They are throwbacks to a different era.

I was a teen when the historical events depicted in the movie occurred, and I remember some of them, which made this especially interesting to me. Occasionally the film falters when it succumbs to cliche, for example when it depicts the relentless efforts of Henry Ford II's kissing, sniveling right-hand man to undermine our heroes. But when the focus is in the lead characters and the road racing, it's a strong pic. I recommend it, especially if you have any interest in international racing history.",

140,2 February 2020,nagsaptarshi,9, Material success vs Excellence- Thumbs Up,"Being a hardcore fan of Christian Bale, I rarely miss any of his movies. But his portrayal of the legendary racer and racing car developer Ken 'Bulldog' Miles in 'Ford vs Ferrari' has simply swept me off my feet. This is a brilliant depiction of the early days rivalry between the car giants Ford and Ferrari where corporate egos of Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari changed the complexion of the motorcar racing in the days to come. Amidst such hard hitting and nail biting corporate egos, what stand tall are the personal ethos, values and camaraderie of the great racers Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles and their everlasting bonding and love and trust for each other and how the machines they rode redefined the very word 'Excellence' and showed the world that greatness originates from not coming first in a race or grabbing a trophy, but from sheer passion for excellence and value addition to life. Bale as the maverick Miles or Matt Damon as his trustworthy friend and mentor Caroll Shelby deliver one of the finest performances of their illustrious careers. Its so good to get back the great Matt Damon in his pristine form after a prolonged hiatus. His restrained emotions and Bale's over the top passion are the two unmatched gems of this brilliant treasure trove. If you want to be entertained for 140 minutes without a single moment of boredom or experience adrenaline rush throughout, 'Ford vs Ferrari' is a must watch for you. One of the finest works on real life motivation, I would strongly recommend this biopic to everyone who think beyond the parochial feelings of rat race or monetary success. Certainly it is going to bag many awards in the coming months. One of the finest Hollywood movies in the past decade. Miss it at your own risk.

The central theme of the tension between vision and collaboration plays central to what makes this movie so great. It has staked out a philosophical position and sets about defending that position within the context of an engaging movie plot. I immediately think of Ghostbusters (1984) as having that philosophy as an easily overlooked component to what makes the movie so great. Fine performances all around and solid pacing sell this point of view while making sure it never overwhelms the movie and becomes preachy. Great movie. it'll be neat to see how it's reputation fares as the years and decades begin piling up. Don't have to be a racing fan to love this.,

As for me, I don't share this same level of enthusiasm. To me, it's an okay film with some nice driving sequences. I prefer films like ""Le Mans"" or ""Grand Prix""...mostly because the ending isn't as obvious and fore-ordained. In other words, if you know about the history of the famed Ford GT, you KNOW how well it did in the race that takes up almost half of this film. Still, the driving sequences are nice (not done with CGI) and the actors try their best....although the script occasionally (or more than occasionally) plays fast and loose with a few of the facts. Overall, very watchable but not a great history lesson and a film where you KNOW that the GT will eventually prove better than the Ferrari...otherwise, what would be the point of this film?!",

The evolution and depiction of all the storylines in this film concludes well and this is definitely an American classic and depicts so many nuances of our culture. This will likely become an underrated American film classic that is definitely a 10/10 must see.",

When the corporate execs disapprove of Miles, Shelby puts his job on the line to help his friend be the first to drive the car and win the La Mans race.

For the die-hard fans and car enthusiasts they understand the mechanics behind it, but for fans like me, well there is a lot more under the hood of the vent. Today's movie is all about the battlefield of racing, though perhaps more of a look into the window of the past in the international racing venue. Tonight we look at the rivalry between two big car empires, in their battle for supremacy as I review:",

In fact my better half was the prime mover in us seeing Ford V Ferrari, James Mangold's clearly, fairly true story of Ford's attempts to achieve dominance over perennial podium finishers, the Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France. This surprisingly entertaining and thrilling story is told through the eyes of Ford's chief contracted hirelings, Shelby American owner Carroll Shelby, and his preferred driver, the abrasive, but extremely talented Ken Miles. Shelby, an ex race car driver and Le Mans winner, will build the race car, whilst Miles, a failed small businessman, will hopefully achieve the desired result on the track. The story, as written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller, essentially sees Shelby and Miles, facing Ferrari on the track, but at the same time, having to wage war with powerful Ford executives, to insure the project remains their creation, rather than become some manipulated corporate play thing.",

Lacks in epic qualities and in depicting the true dangers of racing in those days. Forgettable soundtrack. See ""Rush"" for a far better outcome on all these aspects. The worst flaw is in the way they filmed the circuit De La Sarthe: first, there's no iconic shot on the Mulsanne straight, that's something I don't understand; secondly, they failed in showing what a grind was driving at 300kmh for three minutes, with a couple of very hard brakes. Also, they didn't show the slower classes of cars racing simultaneously, that were a true hazard. Overall, little remains for racing enthusiasts.",

Anyway, this movie is for us racing enthusiasts and also for those who enjoy a good movie, in that the performances of the actors, the script, the direction and technical aspects mesh so well that you get immersed in the story, fictional or not; this movie was not fictional, but almost mythical if you revere the sport of car racing.

221,21 November 2019,Horst_In_Translation,6, A must-see if you are interested in racing (history),"""Ford v Ferrari"" is a new American/French co-production that is mostly in the English language and this could be one of the big players this award season. The director is James Mangold and with ""Walk the Line"" being a personal favorite (also because of the subject) and ""Logan"" that I also really enjoyed, I was definitely looking forward to his newest project. Mangold was not part of the writing team here this time, but it was nonetheless three people, namely the Butterworth Brothers and Jason Keller. But while none of them are rookies amymore, the only really experienced one here is the older Butterworth. Still looking at the film's massive running time of 2.5 hours, slightly over even, it is not too surprising that there are three writers credited. Must have been a really long script. Now as for the cast, it is basically two names only: Oscar winners Christian Bale and Matt Damon. There are experienced supporting actors in here too and you will maybe recognize their faces such as Bernthal, McKinnon or Letts (plus surprisingly familiar faces from NCIS and Prettly Little Liars in minor roles), but nobody comes remotely close to the star potential of the two in the lead. But they are both Team Ford here and not one of them Ferrari as you could have guessed from the title. Now this is major car racing movie, perhaps the biggest since Rush from over half a decade ago and if you liked that one, then probably you will like this one here as well. However, we are not inside Formula One this time, but instead the focus is on a competitive racing occasion mostly that is probably more famous in the United States and less famous here in Germany. I am talking about Le Mans or (if you want the long version) the 24 Hours of Le Mans, even if there are references to other races too like the one Bale's character needs to win in order to be allowed into Le Mans by Mr. Ford.",

As a fan of the 24hr race I found the racing scenes to be heart pounding, adrenalin pumping and visually breathtaking. The core performances from Bale as Ken Miles and Damon as Carroll Shelby really sold the film to me as a couple of die hard car fanatics with a complicated friendship put together beautifully by James Mangold in the big chair. It's not just thrills either. There are genuinely touching moments in this film with a great supporting cast and a great villain in Enzo Ferrari.

225,28 January 2020,Azanspy,9, A very good race.,"Ford vs Ferrari is that old school Hollywood drama that Hollywood doesn't make anymore. This movie reminded me of some excellent films that I have watched long ago. Ford v Ferrari definitely is included in those excellent list of movies now. This movie gives us the chills and adrenaline pumps not only in the racing scenes but most of the other scenes. Matt Damon and Christian Bale were so good as the leading pair as expected. This project started as Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in the leading roles but I couldn't think of anyone other than Matt and Christian for these roles. The movie has drama, comedy, great chills we expect from a racing movie, father son relationship, friendship, wife husband etc. The chances of this movie winning the best picture at Oscar's is few but it's definitely one of the best films I have seen this year and one of the two best racing drama's I have ever seen. P. S. Rush is the other one.",

It is certainly an exhilarating car movie and underdog sports movie at its core, and the racing scenes are gorgeous and put the audience right into the driver's seat. It's a tight script which particularly shines in its dialogues between Shelby and the Ford execs or Ken.

James Mangold has proved that he is a seriously underrated director and needs to be considered as one of the best working today.

233,11 August 2021,dfloro,8," If you're a car guy, or even if you're not","I couldn't help but notice that those rating this movie highly were more or less equally divided between lovers of autos and motor sports (like me) and quite a few lovers of good acting and movies who couldn't care any less about this subject matter. While the plot of why and how Ford took on Ferrari in the '60s at the legendary LeMans racetrack in France is a well-known tale within that former group, it also proves to be an interesting ""based-on-a-true story,"" with several compelling characters involved, for the other group. While there's nothing wrong at all with Matt Damon's portrayal of Carroll Shelby (he really did talk with just that accent!), it's his co-star, Christian Bale, playing the part of the racing driver and race-car engineer Ken Miles, who has the juicier role with the most layers to it. And he's up to the task, as are the supporting actors playing his wildly worried and yet still very proud wife and son. Not since John Frankenheimer's 1966 film ""Grand Prix,"" starring James Garner, has there been an (arguably) better movie about the bizarre and potentially deadly world of automobile racing. (Ron Howard's movie ""Rush"" in 2013 was a good portrait of two very different types of drivers, James Hunt and Niki Lauda, but wasn't as good a movie, overall, as this one is.)",

The scenes where the culture at Ford affects the innovation and Shellby's pitch to put Ken Miles behind the wheels are wonderful and makes the movie realistic.

243,17 November 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, Get your kicks at Le Mans '66.,"'Le Mans '66 (2019)', known simply as 'Ford V Ferrari' in America, is a sports biopic that aims to tell the story of the two men who forged Ford's first racing car. While it initially seems as though it's going to get lost in the corporate politics of car manufacturing, it soon becomes clear that it's far more concerned with its two leads and their strained-but-loving dynamic. By doing this, it skirts the usual biopic issue of cramming a hundred-and-one life events into a two-hour run-time whether they're really relevant or not. Basically, it crafts a compelling narrative from its 'real life' story, adapting things in a very satisfying way. The lead performances are up there with the best of the year, a chalk-and-cheese duo who light up the screen whenever they're on it. Bale, especially, is fantastic, sporting an accent and a slimmer frame in his typical chameleon way. Another star is director Mangold, whose assured direction makes for an engaging experience both on and off the race-track. The racing scenes are the thing's highlight, though; they're fast, suspenseful and technically sound. The piece manages to get you invested in the inner workings of such driving, and such cars, even if you've never given it a thought before. This allows everyone to be on the same page for the stunning finale, which is certainly an edge-or-your-seat sequence. The affair makes a point to take a step back now and again, slowing down for often overlooked character moments and rumination on the hidden beauty of racing. Indeed, it feels like a car fan's dream, dipping into the intricacies of bespoke car manufacturing while featuring a bevy of sleek vehicles, to boot. It isn't exclusively for this crowd, however. The story is resonant and the characters are well-rounded. It is a bit straight white male centric, having only one female character and relegating any people of colour to background roles. It feels old-fashioned in that sense, like a film from the period in which it's set. While better representation would be appreciated, its absence doesn't feel like a product of malice so much as an attempt to convey some sort of 'period realism'. Its plot does feel rather 'us v them', primarily because it associates Ford with America and Ferrari with Italy. Ford, the man, even seems to have a racial motivation, although this could be an unintended result of an early xenophobic comment. Really, though, the decision to position a massive corporation as an underdog is simply to fuel better drama. Still, these are pretty much the picture's only major flaws. It's a good movie that fans of its focal sport should get even more out of than I do. 7/10",

Bale gives a great performance, better than last year in Vice. Damon makes the movie feel real, and the chemistry between them is so brother-like. Jon Bernthal makes a great addition to the cast and makes his scenes quite intense.
The editing and sound are astonishing because it gives us the realistic feeling of racing. Cinematography is life-like and it makes cars easy to follow, I won't even start with the color grading...

253,30 October 2019,gsygsy,4, Technically dazzling with a dull script,"Technically dazzling and well-acted film, but the script is a dull thud.

And he is still one lap behind. The gap is 8,5 miles now. Then boom! He is right behind him again on the very next scene. And this is a 2 and a half hour movie by the way. Some other scenes are ridiculous. Leo Beebe calls a guy on pit and makes him show the sign EZ to slow Miles. He makes million more terrible things like that. Better call the movie Ford vs Leo Beebe. Only good thing about this movie is acting by Bale, as expected. Other than that, it is just another big Hollywood production to make big money by stupifying everything in the story (1917 does the same), because the Hollywood formula demands it.

The film is a technical marvel with top-notch editing, sound design and direction - almost a lock to get nominations (and probably wins) in those categories and then some. Bale and Damon are simply stupendous, showing a real sensitivity in the more dramatic moments while showcasing their charisma and comedic chops in performances that rank among the year's best. F v.

270,18 November 2019,Abranth-d,9, Woah,"Here's my review of Ford v Ferrari . So F v F is the true story of how Ford established a name in racing over a feud with Ferrari while also being a Ken Miles biopic , and James Mangold does both like a master and knocks it out of the park. Christian bale got down to his og English accent and absolutely kills it as Ken Miles with his method acting , Matt Damon too was really good as Carrol Shelby and so were the rest of the cast . The story is an underdog tale about Ford , a company which makes cars for the common man , teaming up with former racer Shelby and his Man behind the wheel , Ken Miles. None of their pasts are revealed or even hinted at and yet you care for these characters , the movie makes you realise that by throwing in a will he die / won't he die based on reaching the rpm limit throughout the entire second act . Also , this movie is masterfully shot by Phedon Papamichael known for walk the line and Ides of March and he makes every frame look gorgeous , which is aided by sleek editing , music and sound design. In the end , Ford v Ferrari is a well directed , masterfully shot , brilliantly acted biopic with neat dialogue , powerful characters , passion towards a goal , a rush of adrenaline , one chameleon called Christian Bale and Ford's marketing strategy ironically said through tons and tons of coca cola product placement.",

Great actors are the ones you don't notice acting. You always notice Bale. The rest of ""Ford v Ferrari"" just kind of lays there. As the story went on, I cared less and less.

Christian Bale is obviously the largest standout of the films high end cast, giving another brilliant performance. Matt Damon is maybe only second best in the film, but he does a great job asd well, and provides for a perfect match for Bale's take on the character and its personality. The film is wonderfully shot, with breathtaking views, and fueled with an often pulse of excitement that truly grabs your attention the way a movie should. The film does seem to start slow, but as with cars, as it goes on longer it begins to pick up speed, making for an exciting ride. The soundtrack is also a particular standout, with an original score that fits its material better than most films this year, and a sound in general that isn't too loud or obnoxious for a racing flick. In the end, Ford v Ferrari is not perfect, but it is a car film like no other and certainly earns a chance in this years Oscar race, as if it didn't have one already.

The truth is that Ferrari were the complete underdog. What actually happened is that huge behemoth motor company Ford tried to buy the tiny Ferrari and Enzo said no. Ford threw their toys out of the pram and decided to build the GT40. With their limitless budget it took a few years for them to finally succeed at beating the tiny Ferrari company at Le Mans. And even when they did, Ford used a 5 litre engine versus Ferrari's 3 litre.

Still, this one works well thanks to the quality pairing of Matt Damon and Christian Bale, who immediately establish a strong rapport which holds the movie together. I wasn't sure about Bale's accent as it veers a little too close to caricature for me, but he does win you over with his exuberance and charisma here so it's all okay.

That raises the enjoyment of it so dramatically that I made an exception. It is true to the original story based on several biographies. Matt Damon and Christian Bale look and sound like the real characters. The acting of everyone is superb. You can watch it for the acting and most of the story alone or you can admire the beautiful look of real film: the rich color we took for granted in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Most movies since the 90s look terrible. It is unfortunate so many have gotten used to bad looking films. For example take the Seth Rogan film ""50/50"" as an example of how worthless good stories are with the dystopic glare and bright, diffused white light of video. They are colorless. ""Sex and the City"" is another good example. In that 2008 film the ocean is a dirty brown in one romantic scene!",

As turnout, this film is about Carroll recruit Ken to contend with Ferrari at Le Mans endurance race under Carroll and Ford company! Entire film quite slow and not intense! The conversation in the film also quite bored! The director keep overuse the radio broadcast scene and overuse of the close up face scene also make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, Carroll and Ken fighting at Ken house and Ken's wife(Mollie) watching them! At the end, Ken idiotically slow down his car to let another two Ford's car won alongside him at the finish line! He eventually finish second place! Ken kill by a car accident! That's it!

309,20 November 2019,oscaralbert,8, The film studio behind this flick does a great job . . .,". . . in graphically documenting another sad chapter in the saga of America's Most Fiendish Family. Edsel's whelp (Hank #2) stands in as FORD V FERRARI's most hiss-worthy villain, as he viciously drives beloved World Racing Champ ""Ken"" to a premature, fiery death in a faulty Ford car. Perhaps it's a wise decision by the filmmakers to forego a prologue showing Hank #1's gun thugs patrolling the world's first auto assembly lines, with orders to shoot any workers who dare talk to each other. Maybe it would be beside the point to depict members of this Corrupt Corporate Fat Cat Family chilling with Der Fuhrer, and providing technical support for the latter's infamous Blitzkrieg. Possibly it would be too much of a tangent to incorporate references to Edsel's Revenge, when Hank One's favorite son was NOT given a starting spot by the Detroit Lions, prompting this petty grudge-bearing conniving clan to BUY the team with the intention of making it the focus of national derision forever.

I'm very familiar with the Ford/Ferrari battle and the outcome of the Le Mans race. But, much like the movie Apollo 13, that didn't detract from enjoying the movie.
You don't have to be a race car fan to enjoy this. In fact, I never watch car racing. The story is brilliantly told and directed. I watched a video, prior to seeing the film, that showed the special effects used to create the race scenes. What's so amazing is how realistic this movie looks. You would never know what they went through to make these race scenes.
Bale and Damon are pure magic on screen. Jon Bernthal as Lee Iaccoca? It works! Everyone was perfectly cast. Lastly, the 2.5-hour runtime truly flies by due to the excellent pacing. You will be glued to your seat.

This movie is spell-binding, heart-pounding, mesmerizing, pulsing with energy, and I was unable to even look at my phone for more than 2 seconds. The actors were phenomenonal, Bale, as always, a force of nature, the man can do no wrong. But Matt Damon, and Jon Bernthal were amazing too, and the incredibly well written dialogue, especially the chemistry and relationship between Bale and Damon, is both hilarious, beautiful, and real. The cinematography, soundtrack, unbelievable sound design, flawless direction all merge together and create truly incredible scenes..you feel the car vibrating, changing gear, speeding, braking, it's glorious. But then there's the ending, which, I guess, was too sad for me, even though it was still real, and emotional, and all that, I needed a happy ending.

I never could understand the appeal of car crash scenes that viewers have seen a thousand times before. The rivalries -- between the US and Italy, the corporate goons and the free spirits, the free spirits and the race officials -- are written in the ham-handed, ""we have no respect for the audience so we'll shove it down their throats"" way you'd expect.

It had what I expected: interesting characters, great acting, thrilling car races. What I did not expect was corporate culture, which had Jon Bernthal play Lee Iaccocca. This added element made the movie even more interesting because you know the protagonists are already fighting an impossible task of beating Ferrarri while having to battle corporate interference. It is the battle between doers and the suits. Bale is one of the rare actors who transforms in every role he is and you immediately forget he was once Batman driving an insane Batmobile. The same goes for Damon and Bernthal. You completely forget Damon used to be Jason Bourne and Bernthal the Punisher. The funniest part is Bale's brawl with Damon as shown in the trailer. I like how Ferrarri is not vilified in the movie, since I am a Ferrarri fan. But on the other hand I truly root for Bale's Ken Miles and Damon's Carroll Shelby to win. This is a movie about two guys struggling to do the impossible while battling outside interference from non experts. This situation is very relatable. The race scenes are exhilarating. The soundtrack blends with the action resulting in a pulsepounding thrill ride. I am even more amazed that this is a true story, but am sure that without the capable directing by James Mangold, and the excellent performances brought by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, this movie would definitely fail.",

Cinematography by Phedon Papamichael immerses the viewer into the racing action. The editing is outstanding and also the sound design is excellent - it makes your heart race faster as you hear the roar of the Ford GT 40. Some of the races are simulated by stuntmen.

Despite its two-and-a-half-hours runtime, it's never dull, and the whiplash cutting and vroom-vroom sounds are wholly deserving of their Oscars. Casting two of the most likable actors around, Matt Damon and Christian Bale, both of who try on different accents, in the leads helps, too. The title, ""Ford v Ferrari,"" winds up being rather misleading, though, as the picture shifts gears more along the lines of Ford suites v Ford gearheads. That at one turn, Henry Ford II frightfully weeps as a passenger in a race car suggests where the movie's sympathies rest in that competition. The pissing competition between two bosses of car manufacturers takes a backseat to this inter-corporate one-upmanship and even that is of less interest than chasing the adrenaline junkies speeding around corners and risking death for glory.

My worry was unfounded - Ford v Ferrari is the best movie I've seen all year. It's surprisingly funny, completely engaging, historically accurate, and now my favorite Christian Bale movie.

Great cinematography combined with pitch perfect (location shoots in Italy) LeMans style car racing and an audio sound that makes you feel like you are at the track side with the roar of the engines and the squeal of rubber burning.,
383,20 November 2019,JankiSharma,10, Being in the race matters for the passionate,"Director James Mangold known for many movies including Girl, Interrupted, Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma has directed the movie Ford v Ferrari based on American car designer Carroll Shelby ( excellent acting by Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale known for American psycho, The Fighter, Vice, the Big Short). Shelby knows Ken is an excellent driver and can easily compete and win a race. Ken is married to Mollie( actress Caitrona Balfe) and the couple have an adorable son Peter( Noah Jupe ..seen him in A Quiet place). Peter follows his dad to the races and autobody shop. Ken is a simple man. Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II has to decide if Ken can enter car race in Le Mans, France and represent Ford. Josh Lucas plays role of Leo Beebe , right hand man for Henry Ford II and does not like Ken's appearance and mannerisms. I particularly liked the scene when Shelby has to tell Ken that because of his image ,Ken cannot be Ford's race car driver. Matt Damon was terrific as Shelby who has money and power to make decisions in favor of Ken but has to get over hurdles created by Leo. I really enjoyed the scenes when Shelby talks to Ford about how folders had to change hands so many times before reaching Ford and impact of decision making involving too many people. Christian Bale as Ken Miles exudes enthusiasm and passion for race cars and abilities to handle speed. Miles is happy to run the race and not too concerned about winning. Jon Bernthal ( movies The wolf of wall street, The Accountant) did very well as Lee Iacocca who agrees with Shelby's faith in Ken's race car driving abilities. Good ensemble of talented actors. Oscar worthy acting by Matt Damon . 2 hrs 32 minutes of Cars, mechanics of fast cars and differences between Ford and Ferrari manufacturers was truly interesting and very well presented. Excellent Direction.",

They matched the tone of the movie extraordinarily well as they were utilised extremely well during the fast paced racing scenes.

385,10 December 2019,masonfisk,10, A CAR RACE FOR THE AGES...!,"James Mangold's (Logan/3:10 to Yuma remake) latest is a fun tale of the rivalry between the Ford car company & Ferrari on who's vehicle would win the infamous 24 hour LeMans race back in the 1960's. Ford enlisted Carrol Shelby, played by Matt Damon, to solve their dilemma which in turn caused Shelby to recruit his best friend/enemy Ken Myles (returning Yuma star Christian Bale) as his driver. Both mavericks in their own fields, Shelby the car maker/seller & Myles the perfectionist racer used their combined talents (& embattled histories) to take on the illustrious task of dethroning the mighty Italian carmaker (who at that point in history made beautiful cars but was in debt). Easy job, you think? You'd be wrong since Ford's underlings & marketing gurus may have had the right ideas on how to make a car look pretty (the '64 launch of their immortal Mustang is featured) but their know how on what made a engine tick properly was lost on them which fuels the constant fire between Ford & Shelby who wanted final say so on the men to race their cars (Miles was pegged as a problematic lone wolf) while Shelby knew he had the right man for the job. Never taking the Cliffs' notes approach to the material but savvy enough to make the car jargon fun & inclusive, this film fires on every cylinder (forgive my car punniage!) staying entertaining & even riveting when we know from history who wins the race. All the actors are in fine mettle including Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas, Ray McKinnon, Caitriona Balfe (from Starz's Outlander) & a special mention to Tracy Letts (playwright of Osage County) for his hilarious portrayal of Henry Ford II.",

This film puts an interesting perspective on LeMans, and how the US got there with the GT40.
I grew up in the 60's. I was 15 when this race occurred. Carroll Shelby was a God and the GT40 a dream.
It was a time when things could get done in this country. JFK said we're going to the moon.....we did. Carroll Shelby wanted to eat Corvettes on the track and he did with the Cobra. Henry Ford II wanted to beat Ferrari and with Shelby and Miles and the GT40 he did. Pull out the stops, damn the corporate committees, just a ""git 'er done"" mentality.
It's a fun film that doesn't get lost in the racing. It is a story of friendship, attitude, determination and yes, Le Mans.
It is also a fantastic ode to some the greatest icons of Automotive history, Shelby, Miles, Iacocca, Henry Ford II.
Go, watch and enjoy,",

406,2 December 2019,Lomax343,8, Even non-petrolheads will love it.,"I saw this at a mystery screening at my local cinema. When I saw the title card, I was dismayed. First because I have no knowledge of, nor interest in, motor racing. Second, because from the start I was expected to root for Ford, when in all sporting events involving an American team and a non-American team, I always root for the latter as a point of principle.
I'm glad I stuck it out, as the film had me sold almost from the start. How true or accurate it is, I neither know nor care, as I was totally involved in the story. Yes there are cliched elements (the interfering company executives etc), and there were rather more dramatic gear-changes than we really needed - but the film revolves around two terrific performances from Matt Damon and, particularly, Christian Bale as a man who not only lives and breathes motor-oil, but regularly showers in the stuff as well.

The performances by Christian bale and Matt Damon were top notch and both their characters are throughly fleshed out. The storyline involving Miles's family was also executed very well and helped in further developing his character. The hard work done by Miles, Shelby and their team, in order to win the race at Le Mans as well as the constant interferences from the executives, form the central narrative of the movie.

In fact the whole movie is not about LeMans or Ford, but about this wonderful character Ken Miles. After seeing the movie I guessed it was all exaggeration à la Hollywood, but after doing some digging I came to the conclusion it was all historically correct. He was really that brilliant test/racing driver and engineer, mainly responsible for the development of the GT40. Disliked by the Ford management because of his attitude and outspoken opinions and robbed from his LeMans victory by these same people. Besides the story, the racing is visually stunning and the CGI crashes make you duck in your seat. A masterpiece you should watch on the big screen.

446,16 November 2019,babybuletgani,6," If you're unfamiliar with the titular race, you won't slip behind","If you're unfamiliar with the titular race, you won't slip behind. Le Mans '66 requires no prior interest in the sport in the same way that you don't need to be a boxing fanatic to enjoy Rocky. At heart, it's a character piece; a platonic romance between two men best able to express themselves behind the wheel. Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon, affable as ever) is a former racerturned-car designer. In the '60s he's hired by Ford to head up the ailing motor company's morale-boosting effort to win the famous 24 Hours Of Le Mans endurance race. And, more specifically, to beat the reigning Ferrari team while doing so.
Shelby brings in his buddy Ken Miles (Christian Bale) not only to help design the vehicle that Ford is betting the farm on, but also to drive it. The aptly named Miles is purely driven by his passion for the automotive arts and an unquenchable need for speed. Wayward Brummie accent aside, it's a lovely, warm performance from Bale. There's the trademark intensity - heightened by his geometrically sharp cheekbones - but here it's in service to a common goal, and a love of the sport. Miles doesn't suffer fools, but there's a sweetness to his family-man side and the sheer thrill he gets from racing, hooting things like ""Giddy-up!"" as he pushes the rev counter to its limit. If Miles is the heart of the team, Shelby's the head, bringing his own racing expertise to bear while also managing the expectations of the suits upstairs, including the irascible Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and smarmy marketing type Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). (There's a barely hidden filmmaking analogy here, as the creative visionaries struggle to keep their ideas on track while placating the needs of the executives.) Throw in Jon Bernthal as another, more amenable, exec and the cast starts to feel a little bloated, especially given that the two-hours-30 runtime is generous for a film on a largely predictable track. Bernthal's good, but did we really need another middle-man in the mix, given that Shelby already occupies that negotiator role?
Le Mans '66 truly roars into life during the racing scenes, particularly the final act show-stopper. The visceral, pulsequickening laps instantly join the canon of great race sequences, and they're a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously 'bankable' blockbusters. But Mangold's film isn't quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen that there's never a palpable sense of a head-to-head rivalry. In their minimal screentime, the Italians come across as scowling stereotypes. And on the subject of stereotypes, Outlander's Caitriona Balfe is lumbered with a limited supportive-wife role as Mollie Miles. It's clear she knows her way around an engine, but she's rarely required to do more that squint with concern at a radio while her husband races. The family scenes don't quite get under the skin of Miles' compulsions in the way that First Man explored the more selfish aspects of Neil Armstrong's pursuits. It's on the physical side that Le Mans '66 really delivers - not only in the aforementioned races, but in the lo-fi mechanics, and the pit stops that canon of great race sequences, and they're a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously 'bankable' blockbusters. But Mangold's film isn't quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen take an eternity in comparison to modern-day refuelling methods. The film is a visual treat, an expertly crafted piece of sun-burnished Americana, with no shortage of big-screen thrills. Mangold's career to date has seen a mix of straightforward blockbusters (Knight And Day, The Wolverine) and character pieces (Girl, Interrupted, Cop Land, Walk The Line) but, for all its strengths, Le Mans '66 doesn't straddle that divide as effectively as Mangold's last film, Logan, did.",

This excellent movie is less about the ins and outs of particular races than about two of the men behind one actual attempt to give America a presence in the toughest race of all. It's a wonderfully American story though one of the men is an expatriate Brit, Ken Miles, played by Christian Bale like he was born to play this role.

456,27 November 2019,CANpatbuck3664,8, Ford v Ferrari is Well Made and Performs as Smoothly as the Cars it Idolizes,"While I'm going to have a couple of complaints from the script later, I want to highlight that it really does a great job developing 3 of the central characters to the film. Carroll Shelby is painted as driven but realistic, one eye on the prize and the other at keeping his team in line. He's passionate about his work but he's learned the hard way that his time in the driver's seat might have passed. I liked that he wasn't just a starry eyed dreamer and was fairly savvy about the challenges ahead and what doing business with Ford meant. Miles has similar traits, he loves to drive but reality hasn't always been kind to him either. He's very animated next to Shelby, both in his expression and his body language. But he has a deep knowledge of automotive work (makes sense, he's working as a mechanic when he's not racing) and a will to keep going. Miles and Shelby make a fantastic team, they form almost a yin and yang bond. I also thought Mollie Miles was a refreshing character. She's more active in the story than just a bystander, her love for her husband and her understanding of how amazing her husband's work was drawn with a light touch and I found their relationship to be genuinely sweet. The core players in this movie aren't just types (unfortunately that doesn't bleed over to the supporting characters... more on that later) and I think James Mangold and the screenwriters (Jez and John-Henry Butterworth, Jason Keller) did a good job presenting them as flawed but realistic people.",

Lots of cgi but merges in quite well. Generally historically accurate. Nice plot in that it creates two anti-heroes battling against being the underdogs and battling against the ruthless ambitions of their own sponsors. Pretty standard stuff really. Bale's UK Midlands accent is pretty poor but just about better than Dick Van Dyke's cockney chimney sweep! Given that he is English it should be better - but he nevertheless presents a likeable character. Damon presents no surprises as the ultimate straight man - but he always does this well. It could have finished nicely without showing Miles' demise - a footnote would have respectfully sufficed. But other than this I'm struggling to really fault the film. Naturally it does gloss over certain aspects of the real story and outside of the USA no one refers to the race as the 24 hours 'OF' Le Mans - but does it really matter and does it detract from the overall story? No of course not. This is exactly what it says on the tin. No more and no less. I refer to my title.😀,

Like many others, I ran to Wikipedia to look up Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby. Miles was a great car racer but not well known outside of car racing circles.The movie lovingly recreates that era and throws in a first rate cast headlined by Damon and Bales, but the rest of the characters ring true. The race car scenes which grab you by the throat are realistic as hell and heart pounding. The scenes showing the introduction of the new Ford Mustang, I remember very well. There were huge crowds at the Ford dealers and the demand for the cars was tremendous. Car racing back in the 1960's was a deadly dangerous sport with very few of the safety features incorporated in today's race cars. The Ford GT 40 really was fast and could hit 220 mph on the straightaways which is what today's Indy cars do, just for comparison. Matt Damon does a great job as Carroll Shelby, but minimizes the way Shelby cut corners in how he sold his cars, and he was slapped on the wrist a few times for his car selling practices. This is one of the few movies today that I would actually buy. It is such a great story and just listening to the sounds those cars made is worth the price. There isn't much not to like in this movie and it is a good antidote to the real world we are living in today if only for a few hours. I loved this movie.",

482,11 August 2021,blott2319-1,6, Another paint-by-numbers biopic,"I'm not sure there's one original thing in Ford v Ferrari. It's as though they took a basic biopic script outline and plugged in all the information that was pertinent to the 1966 Le Mans race. The only reason this movie ranks reasonably well for me and not bottom of the barrel is the fact that I like biopics like this one. Even though I can predict every single beat before it happens, I enjoy the ride. It makes me smile at the right moments, and makes me sad at the right moments. I will note that it never once made me cry, though. I think I could see the strings being pulled a bit too clearly, so the movie became a somewhat mechanical experience and not one that impacted me with any deep emotions. The cast were all solid in their roles, there were moments that made me chuckle, and I do feel like I learned a bit more about this particular race than I originally knew. Ford v Ferrari is a movie that is perfectly acceptable, but never more than that. Perhaps, I've reached that cynical older age where the Hollywood machine can't churn out a movie that tells history in a way that feels ""real"" to me, because I've seen so many others do it the same way before.

483,21 November 2019,jboothmillard,8, Le Mans '66,"In America this movie is titled Ford vs. Ferrari, that is essentially the big hook of the film, film critic Mark Kermode said in his review that this is very similar to Rush, in that the characters come first, and the cars come second (or some people say the other way around). From the trailer I saw I was definitely going to watch it at the cinema, directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line, Knight and Day, Logan). Basically, in1963, Ford Motor Company Vice President Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) proposes to Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) to purchase the cash-strapped Ferrari in order to boost their car sales by participating in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. However, Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) walks away from the deal, after Fiat offer a more lucrative deal that allows him to retain his ownership of Scuderia Ferrari. Henry II is furious and orders his racing division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. For this task, Iacocca hires Shelby American owner and retired racing driver Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), he won Le Mans in 1959, he was forced to stop due to his heart condition. In turn, Shelby enlists the help of Ken Miles (Golden Globe nominated Christian Bale), a hot-tempered British racer and struggling mechanic. Shelby and Miles test the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype at Los Angeles International Airport, finding all its design flaws and making the necessary improvements until it is ready to race. Ford do not see Miles as their ideal driver, due to his abrasive attitude, they opt to send Phil Hill (James Tyler Paulson) and Bruce McLaren (Benjamin Rigby) to the 1964 Le Mans instead. As predicted by Miles, none of the Ford vehicles finish the race. While Henry II sees this as a humiliating defeat, Shelby explains that the GT40 reached higher speeds than Ferrari, instilling fear in them on the Mulsanne straight, before it broke down. Shelby and Miles continue development on the GT40 Mk II, but Miles is nearly killed when the car's brakes fail during testing. In 1966, Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) takes over the racing division and intends again to continue the program without Miles. But Shelby gives Henry II a ride in the car and wages his own company on the line to convince him that if Miles wins the 24 Hours of Daytona, he will be allowed to race at Le Mans. Shelby American enters Daytona, but Beebe has a second Ford entered with NASCAR team Holman-Moody supporting it. While the Holman-Moody team has quicker pit stops, Shelby has Miles push his car to the limit, resulting in him winning the race. At the 1966 Le Mans, Miles struggles with a faulty door during the first lap, team engineer Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon) fixes the door, bashing it with a mallet. Miles catches up with the Ferraris and begins to set lap records. His wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (A Quiet Place's Noah Jupe) watch and listen to the action as it unfolds.
Miles. While racing with Ferrari driver Lorenzo Bandini (Francesco Bauco), Miles experiences another brake failure, but the system is replaced during his pit stop. Enzo Ferrari protests the move, but Shelby convinces the race officials that the brake change is legal. Miles and Bandini once again duel on the Mulsanne Straight, but Bandini's engine blows, and Ferrari are completely eliminated from the race. With three Ford teams in the top-three positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other two Fords to catch up with him and provide the press with a three-car photo finish. Miles is initially against this decision, continuing to set new lap records near the end of the race, but decides to let Ford have their way on the final lap. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, but Miles is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, as one of their cars crossed the finish line just ahead. Although devastated by this decision, Miles is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans. Two months after Le Mans, Miles is testing the J-car at Riverside International Raceway, Miles experiences another brake failure and is killed in the resulting crash. Six months later, Shelby pays Miles' family a visit, Mollie watches as he gives Peter a wrench that Miles threw at him before winning an SCCA race at Willow Springs in 1963. Ford would continue its winning streak at Le Mans in 1967, 1968, and 1969, becoming the only American manufacturer to win the prestigious race. Miles was posthumously inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2001. Also starring JJ Field as Roy Lunn, Jack McMullen as Charlie Agapiou, Benjamin Rigby as Bruce McLaren, Alex Gurney as Dan Gurney (playing his own father) and Ben Collins (formerly The Stig in Top Gear) as Denny Hulme. Damon as the man putting everything into making the winning vehicle and Bale as the loose cannon British racer unafraid to say whatever he thinks are both perfectly cast. It is most interesting true story, corporate company Ford wanting to regain their mojo by winning the 24-hour race, conflicting with the maverick petrolheads, fantastic chalk-and-cheese characters. You grow to like the characters in the slower moments, then you go to breakneck speed in the twists and turns of the racetracks, the race sequences are indeed fast paced with nail-biting crashes, all fantastically edited and with terrific sound design, overall it is an exciting and most enjoyable sports drama.

The whole thing about this movie is that it's not about racing. If you're expecting a racing movie, better go and watch earlier installments of Fast & Furious franchise. This movie is about a great friendship and one of the most famous rivalries in the history of motorsports. Yes, it is a drama, that tells us a very sad story, that I won't tell now in order to avoid any spoilers.
it's amazing how good were the writers and the director, who managed to make an intense movie for a motorsports fan like myself. Knowing the story in details, I was sitting there an watching the movie living every second of it. Amazing work!
Matt Damon and especially Christian Bale are outstanding.
There are slight differences with the real story, but my guess is that it was done with purpose, to make the story more interesting/dramatic.
Overall one of the new additions to the my favorite movie list.
Go to the cinemas, grab a huge pop corn and enjoy more than 2 hours of an excitig story, some very well done racing sequences, great acting and some very good humor.

486,19 November 2019,quasarsq,9, Perfect !!!,"I watched the movie after knowing that James Mangold had directed it. It is one of those movies where after watching it you don't really feel that it was an 2.5 hr movie.It is difficult to compare it with ""Rush"" as the premise is different. Even though the title suggests "" Ford v Ferrari "" but at the core it is really more about Shelby --Miles v Ford Executives.
The movie is able to capture the relation b/n Miles and Shelby as they build a car to race @ Le Mans . As you get to know what Le Mans is you realize the pace of the movie and at the end why is it that you really liked it.The movie is set with mild to Intense racing scenes which can be said as one of the trait of the movie as it doesn't let you on the edge of the seat but rather lets you enjoy sitting back. As to acting with Christian Bale, Matt Damon, Jon Bernthal and other brilliant supporting cast it is what you expect.

488,9 May 2020,akcenat,8, Superb movie not just for a racing fans,"""Ford v Ferrari"", based on the 2009 book ""Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans"", is adrenaline-fueled entertainment, not just for a for racing fans but non-racing fans too. What makes this movie so great are the performances of all the cast, but especially M. Demon and C. Bale - who gives a rock-solid performance that shows the intensity and determination of his character. Damon as - a quite memorable character too, is superb as - 'Caroll Shelby' as he fights for what he believes. But actually, what really makes this film even better is the chemistry that Demon and Bale create together. It feels like they've been friends for life. If the film has a fault, it's that it stops short of showing us what exactly drives both men. The racing scenes are superbly realized, kinetic and thrilling, although there's often a little too much fast-cutting pedal-shots. No mater, the crowning achievement of ""Ford v Ferrari"" is its portrayal of the Les Mans race in 1966 with quite emotional climax. Ultimately, film doesn't disappoint and is highly recommendable.",

If that puts you off, the good news is that the film's not all about racing - probably only ~30% - with much of the focus on Shelby (Damon), Miles (Bale) and Miles' wife, Mollie (Balfe) and son, Peter (Jupe). There's also the tension with Ferrari, where Ford executives Iacocca (Bernthal), Beebe (Lucas) and Ford (Letts) are trying to take the racing crown from Ferrari (Girone) and Agnelli (Cirfiera)",

522,26 November 2019,jamesjustice-92,6, Not a rivalry movie,"When you see ""v"" or ""vs"" in the title of the movie you naturally assume that it would be about a rivalry between the two of the main heroes and this movie can disappoint a lot considering it's absolutely not about that. But if you put aside a misleading title you can have a lot of fun along the way. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are a hell of a team and you enjoy every second of their truly outstanding performances. Bale delivering his lines in his native British accent nails it perfectly whereas Damon's attempts at southern accent executed not always flawlessly but still very good; overall the movie feels really unimportant, with no clear meaning behind it - it is a part of the big company's history and not much of a story in my opinion. We don't see the characters grow, their backgrounds don't change; the only thing that's impressive besides the two main actors are race car sequences but we can watch the sports channel for that which makes this all in all good movie absolutely unnecessary to watch.",

530,26 March 2020,leonblackwood,5, Does exactly what it says on the tin. 5/10,"Review: As I'm not a massive racing car fan, I wasn't over-excited about this movie, but the cast was impressive and the story was intriguing. The director portrayed the 60's period well, and the cars were amazing, but the whole racing car theme became a bit tedious after a while. All of the technical jargon went straight over my head, but the attention to detail, in terms of the cars and the tracks, was on point. The acting from Christian Bale (Ken Miles) and Matt Damon (Carroll Shelby) seemed average in my eyes, mainly because I didn't know the real-life characters that they were portraying, so I didn't know how accurate it was. With that aside, the chemistry between the characters was great, and there were some scenes, which didn't have anything to do with racing, which was enjoyable, but the main core of the movie seemed a bit too safe to me. There weren't any standout moments that stood out, and I wasn't left feeling that I wanted to find out more about the characters. I know that the' race is an important part of American history that will always be remembered, but I personally lost interest once Carroll and Ken joined forces. I did feel the intensity during the races, which made me stick with the two and a half hour movie, and I did find the ending quite shocking, but it's not the type of movie that I will be watching again. That's not to say that it's a bad film because it does exactly what it says on the tin, but it's just not my cup of tea. Average!",

As far as historical accuracy, they just about nailed everything except for the Rolex 24 scene which is set in Daytona, Florida but was filmed at the LA area Auto Club Speedway. This makes sense and isn't a huge issue unless you are a racing fanatic such as myself. As for Ford V Ferrari, at times you really forget that Ferrari are the main antagonists. Ford V Shelby would be a more accurate albeit less marketable title. My issues with the film are that runtime is a little long and few scenes are somewhat cringy(Miles and his wife driving down the road and Miles and Shelby getting into a fight). Its Hollywood so you expect it but the movie could have done without both of those 2 scenes. Still as far as movies about motorsports and sports in general this sets the standard.",

The characters, both central and peripheral, are performed perfectly, and the film includes the best in-car race footage since Grand Prix.

551,17 April 2020,Hussain-AL-Naseer,8, Ford v Ferrari,Undoubtedly one of the best film of 2019 Ford v Ferrari is a sports drama based on true story as stated in premise. The film showcases the perfect blend of thrill whether it's the race track or the corporate clashes. Racing scenes are all that one can anticipate but the sound and performance by Christian Bale makes those parts of the story very much likable. On the other side the part which I personally liked was the Corporate side of the story that how it all started with simple negotiation with Ferrari ended in humiliation and how it motivates Ford to built its own fastest sports car and in that journey how men in Suits exploits their power with their nonsensible ideas to please their Bosses at the cost of compromising the sheer talent and their due credit. Matt Demon Aced his role as balancing the Corporate and field business and has given proper support as an empathetic friend to Bale to which I say both actually complimented each others role which helped them to pull off the emotional drama which makes this movie an entertaining yet emotional sports drama,

A certain brand of mainstream, middle America, crowd-pleasing movie about people that audiences love and critics begrudgingly accept. Movies of this type used to come around a few times a year, and they'd end up at the top of the box office at years end. That concept is completely foreign to an industry held hostage by giant TV series, custom made for a devoted but niche group of fans. We've forgotten that big blockbuster movies can be for everyone.

I sensed Ken Mile's (Christian Bale) desire to obliterate all records and set himself as a Legend in Le Mans. Rarely do movies submerge me into a state of mind that gives me psychosomatic experiences. Those races are large portion of the movie and just like for the pilots we feel their relativity vicariously. The movie is a concerning two hours and thirty minutes, but in no point, in the entire movie, does it get dull, boring, redundant. We get a story-telling that is passionate, nuanced, idiosyncratic, and moralistic. Kudos to James Mangold.",

The photography was as it should be and wonderfully put together. I saw this at an I MAX sitting at the back and with accompanying soundtrack made my day.

And Jon Bernthal's Lee Iacocca puts his wheel nuts on the line, and tells Ford that no one aspires to buy a Ford. James Bond, (that degenerate), does not drive a Ford! Hell they all want Ferraris. Because they are thoroughbred sports cars winning the Le Mans 24 hour race. And Henry, thank god for Lee, actually thinks it's a good idea. So armed with a cheque book and pen, Lee flies to Italy to make Ferrari an offer. Maybe Remo Girone's Enzo played them, because he accepts another inflated Fiat offer. Not sure if it was already on the table, it would appear not. But with Ferrari in play Fiat took a swipe. And by the way Henry Ford is a fat pig Enzo tells Lee, as a parting shot. Who then repeats what he said to Henry. Rightly pissed Henry decides that Ford Motor Cars are going to build their own sports cars. And beat Ferrari at their own endurance race game.",

619,15 February 2020,Exiled_Universe,9, Is this worthy of the awards given?,"Well first off before i saw this movie i realized the following things, first off the movies i like are action and horror/slasher, so clearly after seeing the trailer i realized that it wasn't going to be that which is OK because i can actually watch anything if i feel like it so i gave it a chance especially since it got awards so i was saying it has to be good. Also i realized there are many good actors in this like Mat Damon, Christian Bale and more and that made me want to see it more, plus it was something different for a change and also its based on a true story which is OK in my book. Well now after watching it i realized that it was pretty long considering it was 2 and a half hours which is pretty long but in the end it was OK. So after seeing it i actually liked it, and a few hours later it started to grow on me and i liked it even more. At the beginning it starts off pretty confusing and i lot to take in and i lot to keep track of but at the last 30-45 minutes it gets real good and thats what makes me like it the most. The racing shots are well shot and also the settings are very cool and look awesome as well all some good shots.

The schmaltzy ending had Hollywood written all over it. It they indeed did try to get the three cars to finish together, then the movie accurately portrays the reality of the race. Matt Damon is one of our premier actors although he can be a bit one dimensional. Christian Bale, on the other hand, is phenomenal in nearly everything he touches. Here he plays a complex being whose emotions often get the best of him. His facial features, his cheeks flexing, his demeanor around authority figures all come out in this film. The racing scenes are great fun, but the movie really is too long. Of course, the unfairness of the whole thing is heavy at the end as well as the tragic event that ends it all. Let's face it. It's about selling cars when you get down to it. I'm not saying that the men who do this are anything but amazing, but without the capitalist and the monomaniacs it wouldn't happen. Very good film.",

For viewers of a certain age, seeing Shelby Cobras, Ford GTs, Ferraris, Corvette Stingrays, and other iconic racing cars (or their computerized recreations) from the 1960s chew up the tracks feels like putting on old, comfortable shoes. The cinematography and what has to be a ton of CGI (verified in the credits) plus the pounding, distorted, absolutely perfect guitar music really make this movie for me. I remember seeing the movie ""Gran Prix"" in the 1960s. It set the bar for car-racing movies. This movie attains the same level of gritty realism. The theme song for this movie is a gritty, instrumental version of ""Poke Salad Annie"" and it too is perfect for the movie.",

Ford v ferrari had these brilliant performances as well as an interesting story that is at its core about two men who are fighting for their passion being warped into the 'dick measuring contest' between two large corporate car manufacturers.
As such, the film is brilliantly titled as to reflect the fact that at the end, the story that is recorded will always be the competition between Ford and Ferrari, overlooking the true heroes of the story, Ken Miles and Caroll Shelby. Ford v Ferrari does a great job introducing audiences who may not be familiar with the subject into the world of cars, not over explaining but, simplifying and focusing on what is important making is a very easy viewing. Overall, Ford v ferrari had two memorable performances and was an emotional and insightful ride into the story of these two men.",
629,17 February 2023,arthur_tafero,3, Who Cares?- Ford v Ferrari,"Making a film about the 1966 LeMans competition is like making a film about the 1966 World Series, although millions of more people like baseball rather than car racing. How interesting would a film about the 1966 World Series be? Not very interesting; and not worth more than a ten minute video on YouTube. So, if a baseball film is only worth a ten minute video on YouTube, then a racecar movie would probably be worth only about two or three minutes of video at the most. And even then, it would only interest racing car enthusiasts. Oddly enough, there are sport films that are very successful; baseball films being the leader in this category. There was even one or two good hockey film: Miracle on Ice and Slap Shot. I can't recall a good basketball film other than the Documentary Hoop Dreams. Football also suffers from poor scripts (with the possible exception of Rudy>
There has never been (and there will never be) a top-rated racecar movie. Far better actors than these have tried to make one (Paul Newman and James Garner come to mind).

633,20 April 2020,JeffOA,6, Dumbed-down but fun,"Le Mans '66 is a fun movie despite having an overly dramatized plot. In a way this is your usual Hollywood action/drama flick with little to no regard to respecting how events originally occurred. Lifting inspiration from incidents happening around its main people - Miles and Shelby - and integrating them into their story making it more thrilling but also less believable. Ken Miles' life had enough for a whole movie but they rather incorporated made-up drama than telling about his war experience or perhaps showing that the other drivers are not just there as simple antagonists. The handling of the 'Ferrari deal' is also laughable, distorting history for the sake of extra drama. I am the first to point out that Le Mans - the '71 movie - was a kind of special something, going to the extreme with its focus on motorsport while FvF went to the other extreme where human drama is the most important and the writers did not hesitate to alter facts and sacrifice character integrity in order to serve a thrilling story. In my book this is an inferior attempt at a historic biography/racing film.",

After that, views,images,CGI, cars looked so good that I wanted to touch them in real life. And the strongest point was plot. It started with low force with strong middle and finishing very dramatic.

This is definitely an exception and its a racing movie. Well, sort of a racing movie. The cast is pretty good. Matt Damon and Christian Bale kill it on their end. Its very compelling emotionally and can definitely make you empathize with the characters. Nice to see a movie that doesn't have a political message or underlying social message in 2019. You can go read the synopsis for this movie to find out what its about, but its a great movie for people that don't even like racing. The characters are predictable and the story is rather predictable as well, but it is based on a true story of which we know the outcome and the setting lends an idea of the kind of people you are going to see. This is probably one of the best movies about racing I have ever seen. You don't learn much on the historical side of things and, honestly, that is probably a good thing. If you are looking for the story without the entertainment then watch the documentary, but if you are looking for a fun and entertaining movie with badass cars, then, this movie is for you.

Played with gritty, realistic, and outstanding performances by The Bourne Identity's Matt Damon as Shelby and The Dark Knight Rises' Christian Bale the two Academy Award Winners put fourth powerhouse performances that instantly have you believing they are who they are in the film!! The 1960's was a period of change here in America and around the world & the story was no different in the automobile industry. Shelby was determined to improve his product & win races doing it for the Ford Motor Company and Miles was the perfect man to drive his car!! It's a story of friendship, family, and country versus country as the Ford motored cars finally went up against the built for speed & aesthetics Ferraris in the final race of the film!!

671,10 July 2021,jamesrupert2014,9, Top-drawer top-gear movie,"Designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) develop a racing program for Ford that is designed to challenge the formidable Ferrari team at the legendary '24 Hours of Le Mans'. Mid-sixties sports-car racing is vividly recreated with a minimum of CGI (although see goofs section for authoritative nit-picking), so the film is a vintage-car fan's dream (needless to say though, most of the 'action' shots use replica cars). Damon is fine as the hard-driven Shelby and Bale is excellent as the tetchy but talented driver. The film-makers take some liberties with history, most notably in having Miles listen to the 1965 Le Mans race on the radio rather than competing (as he did, retiring when his early GT40 blew its gearbox). The screenwriter also invented the scene in which a high-speed ride in the GT40 scares Henry Ford II to blubbering tears (a scene so stupid that it almost put me off the film when I saw it in the early trailers). I know that most films are entertainment rather than video-lectures but I still wish that Hollywood (and its rivals) would more closely adhere to the truth, especially when it can be stranger than fiction, as is the case with the ending of the 1966 Le Mans race. Good, noisy fun, just like the real thing (lacking only the manly stench of hot rubber and oil).",

Because I was watching it on the screen and my heart was pounding like crazy. And here is the weirdest thing - I have exactly zero interest in car racing. Yet when I nearly stopped watching, it wasn't because I was bored nor because there was something wrong with the film, it was because it was so intense, I was getting too stressed out. I knew absolutely nothing about the real life story. I do wonder how I would have reacted if I did.

This movie is based on a true story about the fierce rivalry between Ford Motor Company and Ferrari.

They hired Matt-playing Carroll Shelby-to build them a fast car to beat Ferrari. Jon-playing Lee Iacocca-is a negotiator for Ford. Josh is a Ford executive that does not like Matt's pick for a driver, Christian-playing Ken Miles. It is an interesting story of an American car designer trying to beat the European champions.

710,13 April 2020,tkarlmann,10, Forget the 'title' this film is way more important than it.,"This film is ALL about Ken Miles, who tragically passed away, shown briefly near the end of the film.
It is an injustice to name this film ""Ford vs Ferrari"". The film depicts Ken Miles, without whom, perhaps, none of the wins would ever have been made by Ford.
Now, I'm not an avid car enthusiast. That said, I do recall, from my relatively advanced age, that cars from that era, from Ford and other US car-makers, were not that well made. Because of this, later, the Japanese imports had much better fit & finish than US cars did. This is hilariously brought out in this film -- where the Ken Miles character cannot get his race car door to close! Then, one of the pit crew comes over with a Big Hammer (almost like Thor's) and Closes the door!
Yes, OK, there is some in the film about Ford vs Ferrari; but there is more about the Big Shots at Ford wanting to do things ""Their Way"", rather than the Correct Way -- purported by Miles & Shelby.",

719,2 March 2020,calin_hotshot,6, A goofy attempt,"I actually was pretty excited to see this movie. As an athlete myself I must say I usually don't agree with the hollywoodization of sports in general, but with Mangold at the helm and two of the best actors in the business as the main characters I got pretty optimistic.
Needless to say, all three mentioned above do their best, but the writting behind this movie is laughable at best. It tries really hard to be profound, with characters just charghing wrecklesly through the streets to show how pissed of they are, but it never really gets to the level of sentiment you would expect from and oscar nominated movie. I honestly don't know what got that nomination besides the shameless pro-american message.
Ford v Ferrari, which is not even the main thing about this movie, could be easily described like this: take a race car driver and put him in a movie that's not even about racing (it's unlikely it'll be any good). That's about the jist of it, just the other way round.
If you want to make a movie about a sport, just call someone who actually knows that field and listen to them. Sad to say, probably without his fault since it's a nicely passed, good looking movie, this is one of Mangold's misses.
Props to Bale for another great performance. Damon was fine, I guess. Also the movie is way too long at 2h and a half",

A movie about two giant company was fighting for their glory on the mid-'60s.,
728,16 September 2020,Richard_Vine,5, A great disappointment,"With films such as Rush and Senna one believes that it is possible to make motorsport movies that are realistic, reasonably accurate and enjoyable. Unfortunately Le Mans 66 fails to deliver. While the acting of Bale as Ken Miles is excellent and the characterisation of Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari are entertaining almost all other performances miss out - even Matt Damon.
The close-up racing scenes are terrible! Most of the drivers spend their time looking sideways at cars alongside them rather than at the track. They also watch a strange instrument that appears to show the speed in mph! Really!!! When did anyone put a speedometer into a racing car? It doesn't tell you anything and it would distract the driver.
The Ferrari drivers are not given any dialogue so they make up for it with evil smirks taken from a 1920's horror film. The Ford drivers are even less lucky - you don't see them at all! Not even Denny Hulme who shared Miles's car.
The racing at Le Mans was probably the most boring part of this over-long soap opera.
Someone should have decided whether this is a sports docu-drama or a film exploring the relationships between the key players ... Ferrari, Ford, Miles, Shelby. It failed to decide between the two. As the old joke goes - what do you get if you ask a committee to design a horse? A camel.",

730,13 January 2021,Abdulxoxo,8, A skillful piece of filmmaking,"What I enjoyed the most about this film is the way in which the film manages to present both the intellectual and emotional aspects of the story with such a clear vision. At no point do anything ever felt confused. In terms of the car design process and the racing it is perfectly clear what is happening and why. Then in terms of the corporate politics that are at play in the offices that too is written in such a way as to make it easy for the viewer to follow. This film is based on a true story, about which I knew nothing. One of the things I like is watching how much ego and marketing is almost sabotaging the project from the inside. When it comes to building and presenting a Ford racing car to compete against Ferrari at Le Mans, it's clear that everybody wants to win. It's just that too many people had different opinions about how best to achieve that goal; and whether winning the race is indeed the ultimate goal. As previously alluded to Ford Jr is a proud man, who cares about the company having a reliable image. Shelby and Miles didn't care so much about image. They just wanted to build and race the best possible car they could. This internal power struggle is interesting.",

.
.
📜 Plot : American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles battle corporate interference and the laws of physics to build a revolutionary race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.
.
👨‍⚖️ Review : Ford vs Ferrari is period drama set in 1960s. Matt Damon as Shelby and Bale as Ken Miles share chemistry which elevates the experience of the movie. Brillant performances by the leads and a true story fined tuned to perfection (arguably). Bale as Ken Miles is absorbed in the character and delivers praiseworthy performance. Matt On the other hand has provided amazing support. The Screenplay and Direction of James Mangold has brushed excellence in this one. Emotions are realistic and genuine. All in all sports dramas are long but still non Automotive enthusiasts stick to the screens because of the amazing leads at helm.
.
.
👍 Goods : Christian Bale as Ken Miles and Matt Damon as Shelby's Chemistry is infectious and natural . Brilliant Cinematography to reflect times of 1960 with great action sequences of races.
.
.
👎 Bads : Elongated Runtime gives a test of patience at times.
.
.
🔥 Final Rating : 8/10
.
.
✅ Recommendation : If You Love sports drama and donot mind long runtimes. This is one is a must watch.

734,29 December 2019,PeachesIR,10, Thoroughly enjoyed this movie,"Based on a true story, ""Ford v. Ferrari"" is a highly entertaining thrill ride even if you, like me, are not a racing fan or auto aficionado. During the driving scenes at Daytona and Le Mans, I felt like I was in the car! While many action movies today rely heavily on CGI razzle dazzle and outrageous surrealism, this movie gives you action in a more realistic, gritty depiction. You feel how dangerous this sport is, particularly in the '60s. Matt Damon and Christian Bale both give terrific, multidimensional performances as Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles, respectively. Great chemistry between them. They're flawed, realistic characters, passionate about their work and very likable. You root for them. Go see this movie!",

Together, they build a supercar for the Ford motor company and plan to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France.",

744,17 May 2020,numan-05082,7, Better than average movie,This movie is fun to watch. Only I wouldn't watch it again. It is better than the average movies though it is not the greatest.,
745,18 November 2019,dpg-87522,8, One of the best movies of the 2019.,"Ford v Ferrari is one of those few movies based on well-made real events, which means that most of these types of movies concentrate more on telling the event that happened and completely forget about telling a good story based on facts. real with interesting characters, funny moments, visually entertaining scenes, etc. And that is exactly why Ford v Ferrari is such a good movie, it does all of the above and more, and all that is topped off with the incredible performances of Christian Bale and Matt Damon and the chemistry they manage to do between the two. The film does not lack action or humor, both are perfectly leveled, humor is not silly this is introduced in a good way, something that other films of this genre do not understand, in real life there are comic moments, people laughs, not because it is a film based on real events means that there can be no comedy, of course it can as long as it is within reason, just as the action is great, neither more nor less is not forced or anything like that, and those would be the main elements that make the film visually attractive. The film does well not to put the protagonists aside, it gives the characters a touch of personality which makes them interesting, while telling their story, but let's be honest the real protagonist is Ken Miles (Christian Bale) because the film focuses more on his personal life, than that of Carroll Shelvy (Matt Damon), since it sets him the goal of overcoming himself physically and psychologically, and Ken is a true race driver, to hell with Dominic Toretto I want Ken Miles. But despite all that the character of Matt Damon is not far behind he also tries to overcome either because of his health problems overcome that he will not be able to compete anymore, and building a car faster than those of Ferrari at any cost. The film did well by not showing Ferrari as an evil company to win, it is only a battle of companies, even when Ken wins the race at the end Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) shows his respect, one competes against another not because one is good and the other bad, but because of what all companies want money, they want to have the best product to sell, although we support Ford not because they are good or something, but by perspective, we support Ford because the protagonists are with Ford, we would support Ferrari if the protagonists were with Ferrari, in fact the closest to being a villain in this movie would be Leo Bee (Josh Lucas) who is on the side of Ford, and I say the closest because it really is not bad within reason, he just has personal problems with Ken, he doesn't like it, he doesn't want it. And speaking of Ken, I loved his death, I say it moved me, but I say I liked it because it was a great element added to the movie, I think this because it was not something that was removed from the sleeve, the problem of the brakes and of not being able to get out of the car, it had already been used previously in the film, which gives a great touch to Ken's death, it happened once I managed to survive, another happened but this time he wasnt so lucky, The address, although it is not the best in the world, is great, there are several scenes that I can't think of as they were recorded, obviously if there were one with another with special effects, but in other words it is the best part of Mangold. Actually the only complaint I have to this movie would be Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) is not that I did not like the character on the contrary I like it, but the problem is that in the first act you are introduced as 3rd protagonist, but As the film progresses, it loses prominence, taking away its place of 3rd protagonist. In conclusion Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies of 2019, which I really think should be nominated for best film, with a good story, interesting characters, epic moments, great performances, a great direction from Goldman and apart from its best movie, I think this movie is a good 9/10.",
746,1 January 2021,NijazBaBs,5, too sporty,"Although actors look confident, cool, and immersed into film, and movie is based on serious and realistic topic - sports, competition - and motivates us to become better either in cars, or any sports, or anything even unrelated, I did not like this movie so much. It is too much subjective, based on luck and probability, too egoistic, and motivates us in a bad way, that is to drive recklessly. Also too long and not focused on any specific strategy, lesson, point, but luck and randomness. Motivates us at least to improve in some skill, even if unrelated to cars. There are much better and more interesting movies of Matt Daemon. Maybe only good for males or sports lovers. Also motivates video game lovers to play such video games as Need for Speed.",
747,24 January 2020,bsquared-89633,7, Whiplash with cars.,"Fantastic interpretation from Christian Bale. One of his bests.
Nice balance of comedy and drama. I don't fully understand the character development of some of the protagonists. The side cast (wife, petty vice president) feels kinda cliché; I like the interaction, even though they don't provide enough conflict. The main antagonist, Ferrari, has some nice shots but they're not a real threat because we're too immersed into the main character's personal struggle for perfection.
That finale, that missing victory, gives a lot of weight to the whole final act and to the good relationships between Miles and Shelby. But if we look at being and end point, it really says much. I'm a bit disappointed yet happy about the overall movie.",

750,30 June 2020,Richie-67-485852,10, VERSUS YOU,"You get Matt and Christian so right there we are running straight, hot and normal. As for the movie, well how do you like your adrenaline? Here it comes in waves, stops and starts, slow then rush and when a time out comes you take it! What a ride (pun intended). I don't follow this sport but now that I know what is behind so much of what I have seen and head about race cars, tracks, engines and the like I can see why others choose this for their past-time and pleasure. Racing scenes are up to par and presented realistically and one can only imagine the real thing. Keep in mind that only the crème del la crème reaches the top in any sports field and then they surround themselves with other like-minded pros and a professional competitive sports team is formed. This is the case here and aptly demonstrated. There are scenes where brakes turn red hot I mean who can imagine that? The closest we come is riding brakes downhill but they don't turn hot even though I have seen big rigs pull-over because there was smoke/smell coming from their brakes and tires. Also I never knew what Daytona was all about or Le mans either. And stop think about this. Building machines that can move so fast that we measure the speed via RPM's on a dial because we cannot track it any other way. I mean you can normally drive your car for approx 400k miles and 30 years and just replace parts here and there. These boys race a car into its useful life in one big race necessitating replacement of everything after race is over. Amazing pushing of the limits here. Recommend popcorn or sunflower or pumpkin seeds less you fingers make their way to your mouth and you chew nails for some scenes. Include a tasty drink too. Oh, and fasten your seat-belt....LOL",

The story of the Ford company competing in the La Mun race to beat the famous Ferrari is a wonderful story that comes to life. Matt Damon and Christian Bale team up for this awesome experience. All cars sequences are beautiful and well shot. Every close up and detail is beautifully made. What I most enjoyed was the chemistry between Bale and Damon's characters, how they've known each other for a while and need to trust one another to win the race. I also really loved the cars sequences and the whole buildup to the final moment of the movie. James Mangold has done a wonderful job and this film should have won more prizes other than technical prizes at the academy awards, it just deserves more appreciation.",

Despite the premise it's the type of film that has not been seen now a days just a good old basic racing film. No blown out over the top fast car chase extravaganza like fast and the furious.

What really drives the movie is the connection between Damon and Bale you can tell both of these guys don't really like each other at first but they both have something to gain and lose. As. They talk more their very similar to another each with their own goals and dreams to accomplish. And you see the process that they go through across this film trying to achieve the impossible. Really focused more on how to get to that goal rather than just making the car just immediately cutting into the race. While the race most definitely is the highlight finale of the film is very fast pace and really entitled to you and actually get you on the edge of the sea is Miles has to push beyond the boundaries not knowing the car will give out or turn over and crash it's really intense.

Certainly a movie for car racing fans, but more so for vintage cars enthusiasts. Christian Bale excels his acting skills as the protagonist as a car tester/mechanic/racer. Matt Damon gives a great supporting performance. However, Jon Bernthal seems to be a wasted cast since his part where his performance matters gets peaked in the first 40 minutes. He appears to have no potential role after that. Nevertheless, watching the drama between team Ferrari and Ford unfold with sleek shining vintage beauties is a treat for eyes and ears. Cinematography, sound-mixing, screenplay, and editing is on point.

This was it... it's not a hard limit, a few years later these FE motors were turning 8-8500rpms, but the screenwriter for some odd reason focused on this minutiae. Everything else is perfect; although we know what happened in '66, everyone in the theater was sitting on the edge of their seats. The sounds were great, the straight-cut gears in the gearbox whining louder and higher as the car accelerates, with the staccato of an almost-no-exhaust V8, all piped through THX speakers is close to a religious experience, especially as very few of us got to hear this monster live.
Acting is on point, finally a movie where Christian Bale doesn't have to fake an American accent, Matt Damon pulls off a seemingly effortless Carrol Shelby - no doubt weeks and weeks of acting work and watching Shelby interviews went into it, but the whole movie just feels like one of those special ones, where the actors just enjoyed themselves.",

831,9 May 2020,tomfeller,9, Historical movie about the Le Mans race of 1966,"I am old enough to remember back in 1966 when a Ford car won the 24 Hours of Le Mans car race. Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) had gotten into car racing as part of the company's marketing effort for the Mustang, and Le Mans was considered the ultimate race because the cars were going as fast as 200 miles per hour over a 24 hour period. It took place not on a racetrack but on regular country roads. Ford engages sports car designer and former Le Mans winner Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), who once drove for Aston-Martin, to build them a car capable of winning the race. Shelby had retired from racing because of a heart condition, so he recruits English car racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to be the principal driver of the car, called the GT40. The film is very entertaining, the period details seemed right, and the car race scenes are excellent. It was the Oscar winner in the film editing and sound editing categories and nominated for sound mixing.
The dominant racing car up to that time was Ferrari, and the rivalry between Ford and Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) became personal after the latter rudely rejected Ford's merger proposal. Other conflicts are between Shelby and Miles, who are old frenemies, and between the two of them and the top management at Ford, especially Josh Lucas as senior VP Leo Beebe. Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), then vice-president of marketing, does his best to mediate. Damon and Bale are good, but Caitrioni Balfe as Miles's wife Molly is large wasted. Letts turns in the best performance in the film as Ford trying to live up to his grandfather's legacy.",

I guess Bell will die, but I do n't know when it is, so I watched in the second half. I was afraid he would hang up without paying attention. Fortunately, after running the game, although it was best to compromise, it was also very good. His wife said that he had matured, and the carnival before he slowed down was probably the last time he was presumptuous before he matured. At that time, I believe he knew the pressure of his life and his wife and children to raise. Enjoyed great glory and became a great driver, but he still chose to do his duty as an ordinary father and husband, keep the job and support his family. Although he was put together in the end and did not win the championship, it didn't matter, at least all Everyone knows that he is the first.

836,24 November 2019,Lewis_Heather787,7, Not as fast paced as you might think!,"Got to admit that this film was one of my personal most anticipated films of the year. The story itself which I only knew very few details about sounded really interesting, a David vs Goliath type of story. James Mangold's name was also a major attraction to the film, a seasoned film maker with some really good films. However the biggest draw of all was the cast and in particular Christian Bale...........who I will admit is my favourite actor of all time...............and oh yeah Matt Damon isn't bad too!",
837,8 December 2020,mar-moura,10, The best movie I watched since a long time and it's for everyone,"Before writing my review I wanted to answer those who criticized the movie for being historically inaccurate, come on guys this is not a documentary! Even the director said that it is inspired by real life events but not all of this really happened.
And for those who said that this movie glorifies Ford it doesn't by any means, at the time Ferrari had the top cars and racers so Ford envied them, so the movie does the exact opposite.
Now let's talk about why I adored this movie (and I'm not even a car racing fan):
1- The racing scenes were incredible, they are taken from inside the car so you feel that you are with Ken Miles in the car, it's very engaging and exciting.
2- The cast is amazing! with beautiful chemistry especially Bale, Matt , Josh Lucas and Tracy Letts
3- CHRISTIAN BALE! As usual he is unrecognizable and gives a wonderful performance. His character is so likable and unique and you really get attached to him.
I wished more people had seen this movie in theatre because movies like this are not made anymore and it really deserves to be supported. I guess the name wasn't attractive for a wider audience. But anyhow go see it now! You won't be disappointed",

Firstly, the plot is based on real story but it tells masterly and it really cathes viewer. Secondly, the cast is awesome, Christian Bale and Matt Daymon shown amazing duet of friends and true professionals. Thirdly, the races arr shown very natural.
So, it' one of the best film of 2019.",
839,17 October 2022,Camera_Ghost,8, The art of racing,"""Ford v Ferrari"" is an artistic mainstream movie. One one hand, the story is compelling yet straightforward. One the other hand, however, the racing sequences are full of action and energy. It's during the racing sequences where the audience is immersed in the intensity of the race. It's the suspense of what will happen next and who will become the winner that makes each race a spectacle. Each vehicle displayed in the film is a machine that possesses both power and beauty. For the two protagonists, racing is an obsession so great even death cannot conquer.",

It's only about Ford and how they took up the challenge to Ferrari after being humiliated. Sure, the script-writers have taken liberties regarding events and timelines. But the movie tells the tale of what transpired overall while keeping us entertained throughout. Basically the whole Ferrari take over bid by Ford which precipitated a chain of events leading to the showdown at Le Mans. Sure Ford had enormous resources in comparison to Ferrari. But certain aspects of a large corporation approach to motor racing served to hinder than help their Le Mans Campaign. The script does shine a light on that side of the narrative.",

848,17 November 2019,theredsky,7, Ford v Ferrari review,"This was a lot better than I thought it was going to be although I had some issues that held this film from being really good. The first 30-45 minutes were just uninteresting to me. It was well acted but there was nothing that was keeping me interested. Once we get to the point where they are modifying the car, it gets pretty great. Christian Bale and Matt Damon do great jobs but Bale steals the show. Bale is perfectly cast and is fantastic as this angry race car driver. Both Damon and Bale have perfect chemistry and play off well with each other thanks to a pretty good script although not a perfect one. Most of the other actors did a pretty good job also. There is also some good chemistry between Bale and Noah Jupe who plays Bale's son. They also have some genuinely touching moments together. The only character I didn't like was Jon Bernthal's character. I thought he was extremely one dimensional and irritating. I thought the racing sequences in the film were fantastic. They are incredibly well shot and paced. Even though the film is based on true events, I still felt exhilarated and was on the edge of my seat. The Le Mans sequence was one of the best sequences in film that I saw so far this year. The sound mixing is pretty great also. It immerses you within the races which makes those sequences so much better. I felt the last 10 minutes of the film was pointless. I thought the film was gonna end after this desert scene that I won't spoil but it kept going on. The music was also pretty bland. Even after just seeing the film, I don't remember any of the music. Some of the other technical aspects that I liked was the cinematography. During the racing scenes, it was great and during the rest of the film, it was pretty good. The film has a couple visual effects scenes that I thought looked pretty good. Overall, Ford v Ferrari is a pretty good film with great racing sequences, great acting, and some good cinematography even if the first 30 minutes and last 10 minutes were generally uninteresting.",

852,14 March 2020,MovieWarfare,9, Exciting races with great performances and touching moments,"Ford v Ferrari (AKA Le Mans 66 in some European countries) is a story based on the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari in the 60s. It's a sport biopic of sorts with the characters of Ken Miles played by Christian Bale and Carolle Shelby played by Matt Damon of course being real individuals. The story of course exaggerates lots of things for the sake of dramatisation even more than other films so it isn't necessary a typical biopic. The film is directed by James Mangold who directed the masterful film ""Logan"" but the film certainly feels drastically different from Logan. Still, I came in with high expectations because James Mangold directed it and plus all the oscar buzz around the film.",
853,27 December 2020,MintyMinute,9, A movie about car racing made me cry.,"I don't know anything about race cars really, so I don't know what struck me to watch this movie. But I don't regret it. It was more than just racing.
Acting was phenomenal, except for one or two lines I heard come out of Henry Ford II. Expect to be enthralled by the characters (I absolutely love the dynamic between Ken Miles and Shelby), but even more so by the movie itself. At some points suspense had me ready to jump off my seat. Humor always kicked in at just the right moments too.
I feel like the movie is sending a message about trying to find the balance between trusting yourself, leading, and trusting others, following them, in order to speed to your goals without exploding. That's what I got from it, and if I'm right about the message, I think it's a good one.
Feel like this review is turning out a bit messy, but like Shelby says in the movie, sometimes ""words just are not useful.""
Just know, the movie's pretty darn good.",

It shows how the ford company was struggling back then so they made a movie about racing to boost their company. My favourite part was when Shelby told ken to pass the finish line with the 3 ford cars at the same time and ken went fast through the first round but waited for them at the end so they could cross it together. I just don't like how they made him do that so someone else could win the race. But overall the acting was really good and I would definitely watch it again.",

857,25 January 2021,Jackblyth8,9, A 'First Place' Film,"The film also known as 'Le Mans 66' provides us with a warming story centred around Ford's desperate push to beat Ferrari in racing. 'Ford v Ferrari' prepared the roles of the joint protagonists to be Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, however, a change in casting saw Christian Bale portray Ken Miles, an English race car driver and mechanic - and Matt Damon play Carroll Shelby, an automotive designer and former driver himself. The film, lasting for 152 minutes, begins in 1963, Ford Motor Company Vice President Lee Iacocca proposes to Henry Ford II to purchase the cash-strapped Ferrari as a means to boost their car sales by participating in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. At the very beginning, we see Matt Damon's character driving in Le Mans, struggling to cope with his heart condition, despite going on to win the 24 hour tournament. Enzo Ferrari however, uses Ford's offer to secure a more lucrative deal with Fiat that allows him to retain complete ownership of Scuderia Ferrari. Enzo Ferrari and Henry Ford II share very similar ambitions and in their attitude are very alike. Both capitalists in their business, thriving for profit and greed, Enzo's success with Ferrari makes Henry envious, and displays a sharp, harsh nature towards his workers. In rejecting the proposed deal with Ford, Ferrari also intentionally insults both Ford Motors and Henry Ford. In response, a furious Ford orders his racing division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. For this task, Iacocca hires Shelby American owner Carroll Shelby, who as mentioned won Le Mans in 1959 but was forced to retire due to a heart condition. In turn, Shelby enlists the help of Ken Miles, a hot-tempered British racer and struggling mechanic. Ken wears his heart on his sleeve, has a passion for driving and expresses his loves his wife and son, his race car driving, combined with his work as a mechanic at his garage, wasn't supplying enough money for his family, and his financial situation was worsening. Shelby and Miles test the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype at Los Angeles International Airport, working out all of its design flaws until it is race-ready. Seeing that Miles is not their ideal driver, Ford opts to send Phil Hill and Bruce McLaren to the 1965 24 hours of Le Mans instead. As predicted by Miles, none of the Fords finish the race. While Ford sees this as a humiliating defeat, Shelby explains to him that the GT40 instilled fear in Enzo Ferrari, as it reached 218 mph on the Mulsanne Straight before it broke down. Shelby and Miles continue development on the GT40 Mk II, but Miles is nearly killed when the car's brakes fail during testing. In 1966, Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe takes over the racing division, with the intent to continue the program without Miles, but Shelby gives Ford a ride in the car, leaving the Ford owner overwhelmed, and wagers his own company to convince Ford to agree that if Miles wins the 24 Hours of Daytona, he will be allowed to race at Le Mans. Miles' humorous nature makes him appear to lack etiquette and profession in the eyes of Ford, knowing that this is one of the biggest tasks that they have ever attempted, they are unsure if the British driver has what it takes. Ken is influenced by his family and the choices he makes are for them, despite saying his racing days were over, he found out how much he would be payed if he'd joined Ford and took part in Le Mans, knowing it would be enough to help the family cope financially. His son plays an underrated part in the film, Peter watches his Dad in every occasion, and shares a love for driving, aspiring to be like his Dad one day. Following the brakes-failure, witnessed by Peter, he fears for his Father, worried that the door may not open next time when a fire breaks out. Shelby saw something in Miles that not many saw, knowing his driving ability, he is convinced that Ken is the right man to take on Le Mans. Shelby is like Ken, an intelligent man who also shares an inclination to driving. His past experiences in driving and being made to retire early adds to his attitude, reasoning why he is very rarely happy, inferring he still wishes he was out on the track racing again. Shelby American enters Daytona, but Beebe has a second Ford entered with NASCAR team Holman-Moody supporting it. While the Holman-Moody team has quicker pit stops, Shelby has Miles push his car's limit to 7,000 RPM, and he wins the race, jubilation for Shelby and Miles and a foolish-looking Beebe reports back the news to Henry Ford II. On the night before Le Mans, Miles shares a scene with Shelby on the track, Carroll seemed to be reminiscing on his victory not too long ago, Miles shows no signs of nerves, more excitement to show what he's capable of. If there's one person to coach and manage you throughout a 24 hour race, it's someone who has done it before, not only had Shelby raced Le Mans, but to win it, makes him the best man to coach the team. At the 1966 24 hours of Le Mans, Miles struggled during the first lap with a faulty door, but after team engineer Phil Remington fixes it with a mallet, Miles begins to set lap records while catching up to the Ferrari's. the fast-paced sequence of tiredly racing, Ferrari driver Lorenzo Bandini - whilst piloting Ferrari's new prototype 330 P3 - Miles experiences brake failure and has his brake system replaced replaced during his pit stop. Enzo Ferrari protests the move, but Shelby convinces race officials that the replacement is legal. Miles and Bandini once again duel on the Mulsanne Straight until Bandini blows his engine, eliminating the Ferrari from the race. With the three Ford teams in the top positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other two Ford cars to catch up with him and provide the press with a three-car photo finish. Shelby reluctant to tell Miles, but commanded by Beebe, explains the situation to Ken, who is initially against the decision, continuing to set new lap records near the end of the race, but decides to let Ford have their way on the final lap, slowing down to allow the other two cars to catch up, as ordered by Beebe. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, because in the sprint start to the car, his car was further behind Miles', but, the British driver is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans, Shelby comforts Miles and with regret, states he shouldn't have told him (about Beebe's idea), the two walk away from the Ford celebration arms around each other. Le Mans 66 may not have been won by Ken Miles, but he certainly dominated it, breaking track record after track record and being the English man he is, stereotypically enjoying a cup of tea during pit stops. His mastery in race car driving was apparent throughout the famous French race, and rather than dwelling on the end result, he followed orders and did what Ford wanted, knowing that there is more important things in life, a smile didn't leave his face. The clips from Le Mans would go over and show Miles' son and wife listening in on the race with. When the family were informed by the race commentary that Ken had slowed down, Peter was confused and questions what his dad was doing, his mother smiled in pride, knowing that he had already won the race, and was doing what he had to do. Two months after Le Mans, while testing the J-car at Riverside international Raceway, Miles once again experiences brake failure, with his son watching on, the feature heads into slow motion as Ken doesn't appear to exit the vehicle, he was killed in the resulting crash... ""Sometimes the door doesn't open"". Six months later, Shelby pays Miles' widow Mollie and Peter a visit, and gives Peter a wrench that Miles through at him in an argument before winning an SCCA race at Willow Springs in 1963. Ford continued its winning streak at Le Mans in 1967, 1968 and 1969. Ken Miles was posthumously inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2001. The sports drama film portrayed the life of an ordinary race car driver, who was happy doing something he loved, despite a bust up with Shelby following his short release by Ford, it was great to see the pair reunite not only as workers, but as friends, and that friendship is exemplified in the emotion shown by Shelby thinking about his Ken latter his death. The film doesn't show Ford in a good light, rather pointing out its capitalist order and focusing on the Le Mans victory being all about the company, rather than the success of an individual. The photo attached shows the man who did what many thought he couldn't do, a racing legend.",

Went into this movie thinking it was another attempt to use a star studded cast to take my money and grab my Interest. That's exactly what it was and I've never been happier. Film is expertly written, expertly performed and expertly directed. One of those once in every two years kind of film, one you can pull out on a rainy night in 10 years from now and be ever so glad you did.

The way they choose to show this had a few great scenes, but ultimately was not as interesting as it could be in documentary form.

I wonder how true to life the story is because Ford and his minions came off kinda bad. In any case, it's a great flick. Nice to see a movie today without all that condescending PC/feminism polluting the story. This felt real, not forced into today's narrow PC Hollywood storylines",
894,14 January 2020,slsyroney,7, Fun!,"Christian Bale killed it in this movie. Matt Damon was great too. As a racing movie, a bit of a let down but the last race was fantastic. A real nail bitter! The title Ford V. Ferrari is misleading; it really is a story about two guys who love cars, and I really appreciated that. I really loved the family dynamic with Bale's character in this movie especially. Overall, I can see why people would give this movie a perfect score, but for me the writing just makes it fall a little short. But for a biopic, it was fantastic!",
895,15 November 2019,varun-25071997,7, Christian Bale and Matt Damon save this predictable Drama,Both the lead actors of Ford V Ferrari are some of the finest actors of this generation who have been struggling to find a hit since 2015. But this film has given them a much needed hit and potential Oscar nominations. Mangold has delivered a very good follow up after the blockbuster Logan. This film scores high on production values compared to other action / racing films which is a huge plus point,

897,3 March 2020,WooderIce64,9, Thrilling and Satisfying,"A popular film among audiences and winner of 2 Academy Awards, Ford v Ferrari appears to be a sleeper hit of 2019. It tells the true story of Caroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as they work to get the Ford Motor Company a seemingly impossible victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. The performances from Damon and Bale are very good, giving us two easily likeable characters. It has these two determined men as they face opposition not only from the demand of making the fastest car in the world, but also from executives from the Ford Motor Company. Despite what the title may think, Ford is made out as a villain of sorts, even more than Ferrari. This isn't as much the story of Ford's upset of Ferrari as much as it is Shelby and Miles' upset of Ferrari.",
898,15 December 2019,rfrankssr,10, Firts rate film with a first rate cast,"This is why I go to the movies. James Mangold has always been a favorite Writer/Director of mine and he delivers perfectly with this 'buddy' movie about one of the greatest drivers of all time with one of the greatest car designers of all time. Bale and Damon are spot on , though it's hard for me to decide which one turned in the best performance, because, as of this writing, Bale has locked the Golden Globe and SAG nominations. The rest of the cast just added to the incredible story of Ford taking on Ferrari at the 24 Hours of LeMans.
For racing enthusiasts, this is pure adrenaline, several scenes during the race sequences that made me jump back in my seat. Phedon Papamichael's cinematography is amazing. There is a scene where Miles (Bale) takes his son out to the LAX runway and explains to him the perfect lap. It was such a touching scene (it plays later in the movie) because of the way Papamichael lit it. It sent chills down my back.
In conclusion, a must see film for anyone, racing enthusiast or not. One of the best race films ever and one of the best pictures of the year.",

Starring Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby. Back in the early 1960s the famous American Muscle Car was better known for the person than the actual car. ""Shelby"" was recently forced to retire from racing because of a heart issue. Now he's trying to settle into this lifestyle of selling his pristine car.",

Matt Damon does a decent Matt Damon but Christian Bale's portrayal of Ken Miles is so corny I could hardly believe what I was watching; I half expected him to start singing Knees Up Mother Brown but we got I'm H-a-p-p-y instead. Also, some of the car sequences were clearly sped up which made it like watching one of the old Herbie movies. Rubbish.",

I can't not see the Punisher when Bernthal strides on screen. Balfe played a minor role, but her outburst in the car felt like it was shoved in to provide some character development. McKinnon was absolute perfection, like they just borrowed him from a real pit crew. The story doesn't pull you in. There aren't big dramatic moments that mattered to me. Instead, the acting and dialogue were enough to pull me in and enjoy the flow of the movie.",

the time line is out. ford started this project without shelby, shelby came later after ford lost his first two tries at le mans. miles drove in the race the movie said that he had to stay home for.
where are all the other cars? for a hundred million dollar budget, they could have at least used some stock footage to show all the other cars in all the other classes that are involved also.
where was the winner's podium? ford and all others protesting that miles should be awarded first prize.
why was ford and his crony made to be villians? after all, it was his company, his cars and his race. why add the fake conflict?",
919,1 December 2019,d_thoraz,10, FORD=First On Race Day,Great movie with a great cast! Shows the origin of the Ford GT40 and the initial struggles Ford and Carol Shelby had to overcome in order to contest Ferrari's dominance of the racing world in the 1960s. Damon and Bale play a great duo in this movie which really makes the movie comical and dramatic throughout. Definitely recommend this movie!,

922,28 January 2020,MarenacioBanks,7, Dying to Tell,"As a huge fan of Christian Bale, and an even bigger fan of Enzo Ferrari and the journey behind the Ferrari perfection, it was a story which grabbed me from the first frame and held me captivated to the last frame. The element of Ford becoming not only a contender but a winner of the Le Mans, not really a spoiler it's already down in the books, does very little in itself, however the journey and the eccentricness of the man behind the wheel who helped make it possible was the films shinning beacon. Also appreciated the short inserts of Lee Iacocca and his contribution to the Ford racing program. Ford v Ferrari puts a fresh perspective on a moment in history which most would most likely care less about, but it does it in a way which could be entertaining for a whole family. It's the classic underdog story, which that character arc which you would expect, but with an altruistic defiance to confirm and follow rules which add an almost James Dean rebel without a cause type flare to this film. All in all fun film and entertaining.",

What are they doing? When the structure was completely built, what i liked most is you don't get lost with the movie it can express itself easily such a well done editing the movie just kept me alive and i was linked to it really, there was really a tug of war between the two great characters (Matt Damon) and (Christian Bale) Christian really outshines Matt, i didn't know how i flew over time because a two and half hour movie is long, ending felt so sad to me situations really changed from first to last, i like cars but am not into racing cars but i am glad i got knowledge more on them how things are going on, highly recommended even if you are not into cars, 10/10⭐",

From the very beginning of the movie, Ken's respect for the game, his understanding of the car, and his grasp of every corner, all showed the highest professional quality of the athletes. I saw the supremacy of sports in him, but it was very helpless. Sports is a game between pure capital. In the eyes of capitalists, sometimes winning or losing is not the key. The most important thing is how to use means to ensure the maximum benefit. There is no winning or losing. Only the pros and cons are completely contrary to the spirit of sports. Ken also made several psychological struggles in the car on the last lap. At such a fast speed, he still had to make a choice of thoughts. He was really helpless in tears. On the other hand, in order to compete with absolute speed, even if the vehicle is out of control, Enzo Ferrari is basically on the scene throughout the game. The Italians themselves are worthy of respect;",

I personally don't know anything about it, I like racing video games but don't actually know that much about cars. But there is some beautiful cars in this movie, really mesmerizing. Acting is good too, on most accounts, especially Bale off course, but he already proven to be a great method character actor by this point, it will be intresting to see what he does next in his career. The story is off course very predictable if you already know the true story, which I actually did, but it was very good watch anyway, inspiring and tragic. Cinematography and sound outstanding.
