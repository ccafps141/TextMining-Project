This is the film that played by the rules while elevating the form, and remains the touchstone for those who talk about Hollywood's greatness.",/

Maybe Raft showed some good sense in letting a better actor handle those roles. In any event we've got some proof in the case of Casablanca.",e
3,10 November 2004,kdryan,10, A masterwork for all time...,"There is a scene about halfway through the movie Casablanca that has become commonly known as 'The Battle of the Anthems' throughout the film's long history. A group of German soldiers has come into Rick's Café American and are drunkenly singing the German National Anthem at the top of their voice. Victor Lazlo, the leader of the French Resistance, cannot stand this act and while the rest of the club stares appalled at the Germans, Lazlo orders the band to play 'Le Marseilles (sic?)' the French National Anthem. With a nod from Rick, the band begins playing, with Victor singing at the top of HIS voice. This in turn, inspires the whole club to begin singing and the Germans are forced to surrender and sit down at their table, humbled by the crowd's dedication. This scene is a turning point in the movie, for reasons that I leave to you to discover. ",v
4,14 July 2011,ElMaruecan82,10," We'll always have ""Casablanca"" ...","A few movies managed to achieve such a legendary status. Think about it, all you have to do is to hum the first notes of 'As Time Goes By'  ta-da ta-da ta-daaa  and a whole universe resurrects in your memories, forever incarnated by these two profiles staring at each other, Humphrey Bogart in the iconic trench-coat of his career-defining role, and Ingrid Bergman, as gracious as ever.",i
5,30 November 2004,smatysia,10, Here's looking at Ingrid Bergman,"Wow! Ingrid Bergman was at her best in this one, as well as her most sad, doe-eyed, beautiful. The part of Rick seemed made for Bogey, with the snappy repartee, and the cynical shell around what Renault refers to as ""a rank sentimentalist"". It seems like every time I see this film I notice something new. This time it had to do with the Bulgarian woman, Annina Brandel, who Rick rescues from the carnal plotting of Captain Renault. I never gave this scene much thought, just assuming that it was a way to plumb the limits of Rick's cynicism, as noted above. But later, during the scene where Ilsa tells Rick that she'll stay with him if he will use the letters of transit for Laszlo, I realized that the two scenes were a common theme, that Rick realizes he'd be no different from Renault if he followed through with that. I guess one gets lazy seeing modern Hollywood fare. Nowadays, the director would have used a flashback image or something, in order to bludgeon the viewer with the correlation. But back then, with a better-educated public, one could allow audiences to discover things for themselves. It was also skillful how these films could be more or less suitable for children, as well as adults. When I saw this film as a child, it never occurred to me that Rick and Ilsa had had sex. But the clues, while too subtle for a child, were pretty obvious to me as a man. Like many people this film is my all-time favorite. Grade: A+++++",e
6,17 March 2003,Dockelektro,10, Now I finally know why this one is one of the best,"Probably the most legendary movie of all time, I finally got to see it, it was a great hole in my movie-viewing history. And finally I got to understand why a classic movie like this has made its mark in history. The intricate political plot comes first, and sets the movie on a melting pot of the second world war, where everyone hopes and dies for an opportunity to reach the USA via Lisbon. This would provide sufficient material for hundreds of movies, but enter Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, magnificent cinematography, role model storytelling, a perfect supporting cast, some of the best dialogue ever commited to celluloid and Dooley Wilson singing THAT song, and history was made. More than 60 years of jaw-drops are sufficient to give the sceptics a good reason to make them understand that this is probably the greatest classic movie of all times, and one of the best ever made in the past, present and future.",w

10,21 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10, One of the best black and white films I have ever had the privilege of watching!,"Casablanca is just an extraordinary film, if I had to describe it in one word, it would have to be perfection! I honestly don't care that it's an old film, I personally think that's not a convincing enough excuse for hating a film as wonderful as this , because you are seriously missing out, if you haven't seen it. The cinematography is just fantastic, with clever brooding camera-work. The music by Max Steiner is outstanding, from the sweeping haunting love theme As Time Goes By, to the excerpts of the french national anthem. The scene where everyone starts singing in the café was extraordinary and one of the many highlights of the film. The screenplay is unquestionably one of the finest in the history of cinema, right up there with Shawshank Redemption and All About Eve, containing great memorable lines such as ""seems as though Destiny is at hand"". The performances were superlative, Humphrey Bogart giving one of cinema's greatest lead performances as the ""cynical sentimentalist"" Rick Blain. Also superb are Ingrid Bergman who positively lights up the screen as Ilsa, the young woman who breaks his heart, Paul Henreid as the fugitive husband, and Claude Rains as Captain Renault. The plot is a little complicated, but I couldn't help being impressed with the performances and the screenplay. Not to mention a timeless love story that I don't think has ever been topped. Overall, a masterpiece, that quite rightly received an academy award for best picture. 10/10 Bethany Cox",5

22,9 November 2005,ma-cortes,8, The most famed for many and one of the greatest movie ever realized,"Casablanca is deemed by many to be the biggest picture ever made and one of most famous movies of all time . It's a masterpiece produced in 1942 that was thought as a run-of-the-mill studio production . It was only afterwards which it became clear that it would be a landmark cinema . Humphrey Bogart's forty ninth film , would transform the studio contract player into a superstar and to be the first in a whole string of Warner Brothers's classics in which he would play the leading role . Producer Jack Warner assigned the Rick's role for George Raft , however Hall B. Wallis wanted to Bogart who luckily obtained the important character , but he previously played only mobster roles and afterwards romantic protagonists , besides tough main lead. It's an extremely romantic film converted in cinema history with images (Rick and Ilsa embraced) , moving scenes (final farewell in the airport) and dialogs have been used or imitated in other films, spots and television programmes .",_
23,3 August 2013,ironhorse_iv,9," Of all the review joints, in all the towns, in all the world, you walks into mine. Here's to you, Kid. Casablanca is iconic! Play it again, Sam.","From 1942, comes a romantic historic drama directed by Michael Curtiz movie based on the stage play Everybody Comes to Rick's by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. It's early Dec. 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the owner of an upscale nightclub in Casablanca, Morocco that attracts everybody from Vichy French, Italian, and German officials; to refugees desperate to reach the still neutral United States; and those who prey on them. Rick stands as an allegory to U.S polities at the time trying to stay neutral and not involves himself into the war affairs. I also think it's cool to point out that Humphrey Bogart himself was a decorated war veteran, and this is reflected in his performance. It wasn't until a former lover Norwegian Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her Czech Resistance leader husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) came into the bar looking for a way to escape Europe, where he states to question his beliefs. While most people know Casablanca as the exploration of the universal themes of love and sacrifice, people that look more into it viewed it as a political allegory about World War II. Ilsa can be seen as the wealthier of Europe who were able to escape due to their wealth, but whose warnings and pleas were dismissed in the late '30s and early '40s. Victor represents the poorer people of Europe who weren't able to escape and whose discovery prompted the change in attitude. When he appears, Rick finally grasps the true nature of what Ilsa is asking him. The film is set in Dec. 1941, the month in which the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. That attack changed the course of American history, awakening the nation from political neutrality and thrusting it into the midst of World War II. By Illsa showing up, Rick become a symbol for America to take a stronger stand against the Axis Powers. The film also tells the story of another transformation, that of the local French commander of Casablanca, Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains). Claude Rains is the second best actor in the film besides Bogart. He plays the role so well. Louis begins the film as a pro-Vichy Nazi-appeaser but winds up a committed partisan of free France. Scenes such as Captain Renault throwing away the Vichy bottle it was meant to shown a rejection of Petain's puppet government. Even the great line near the end, 'I think this is a start of a beautiful friendship' stands for United States becoming allies with the French into stopping the Nazis. There is a great scene in the middle worth checking out, where the Germans start singing and, to combat it, the other patrons start singing the French national anthem was a truly moving part. The use of shadows and lighting makes this movie into one of the greatest film noirs. The use of the spotlight that shines from a tall tower and lights up the city of Casablanca reminds people that they are always being watched. It was a great use of light to represent fear and a threat. The music by Max Steiner was just amazing. The song ""As Time Goes By"" by Herman Hupfeld had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song, so Steiner based the entire score on it. So, without Bergman cutting her hair. We wouldn't have that theme. The theme of Sam's piano is the symbolic heart and soul of Rick's Café. All the guests want to sit beside it, because they want to forget their worries by listening. The piano suggests purity, which may be why Louis doesn't even think to look there for the letters of transit. I love the smart dialogue. The exchange between Rick and Louis were funny and brilliant. There is a few criticizes that need to be address. The usual conspiracy-theory gang likes to say that this movie was just propaganda. I didn't care if it's pro-Allied propaganda, it was a good movie. Some people think its basically a rip-off of a previous 1938 movie called Algiers. The writers took the character of Rick from the unproduced play, the theme ""As Time Goes By"" from a failed early 1930s musical and even parts of the dialogue were cannibalized from other unproduced scripts. It's doesn't bug me because it was mixed so well. I honestly don't see how the line 'Round up the usual suspect' is famous. It seems very not important from the rest of the best one liners. I believe Ingrid Berman delivering lines acting was mediocre at best. Her eyes did most of the work. Paul Henreid was indeed a stiff. Henreid did not get on well with his fellow actors and it shows. His character seem plain compare to the others. I didn't like how the movie treat the German actors in the film. The German actors had to keep curfew, as they were classified by the US as enemy aliens and under restrictions. They were frequently cast as Nazis in war films even with the fact that there weren't any uniformed German troops in Casablanca during WWII. Then there is the colorization controversy. Don't see it in color, its work best in Black and White. Trust me. Overall: The story itself is straightforward a realistic romantic movie with political allegory. The film's lasting enchantment is due to its dramatic conclusion and the theme of the inescapable past. The plane theme works because it was the escape of such memories. If you don't get onboard and see Casablanca. You might regard it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.",=

I must say I was surprised at just how good it was. Before, there had always been distractions, but today I watched it right through and I must say I was very impressed. It's the kind of film my parents would watch and so it never featured very high on my radar. But when I got into watching films more seriously this was always one of those that had a lot of critical acclaim and so I added it to 'The List'. It finally lands on TV and I had a chance to see it tonight Truly excellent! I will explain what I mean by that after this very brief summary.",t
26,1 June 2009,cordaro9418,10," ""... human life is cheap.""","Where to begin..? Originally believed a 'B' film in their product, Warner Bros. never conceived the effect the movie would have. Shot in sequence due to a script written daily, the actors never knew what to expect from the characters day after day. The fact that not even the writers knew who would win the girl till the night before the classic scene was shot. And yet 'Casablanca' is listed at No. 2 on the AFI top 100 films of all time (though should, in all actuality, be flip-flopped with 'Citizen Kane' for the top spot). With success in 'High Sierra' and 'The Maltese Falcon' (Thanks in large part to a rather ignorant George Raft) Bogart was well on his way to being a legitimate leading man. This film would make him a legend a studio star and later, a legend. Sure his body of work was the main factor, but 'Casablanca' in hand with 'Falcon' created the mystique of Bogart which films like 'To Have and Have Not' and 'The Big Sleep' only fueled. A mediocre effort from Warners which molded many of their castaway Euro-stars into a great and well written tapestry where everyone stole the scene from everyone else in such fashion it appeared seamless. The film moves along introducing us to each character in perfect detail, the harsh environment of Casablanca, that war-torn sweat-box which could easily double as a Tatooine spaceport from 'Star Wars', and the Nazi imperial rule who smothers them all. Never looked upon as epic and not even filmed as such 'Casablanca' exudes Epic film in a nice tidy package. With all around fantastic effort from everyone on screen with a great turn by Claude Raines the film is a must see and worthy of No. 2 on the list (sandwiched between 'Kane' and 'The Godfather'). Quickly paced and keeping you in your seat, get the popcorn and don't even think of going to the bathroom.",_

The tone of the story, and the presentation of the legendary Bogart persona, and his most famous characterization, Rick, the American ex-patriot owner of the famous Casablanca night club, is completely exemplified in two early scenes. The essence of ""cool"" and ""authoritative,"" Rick is in the private area of his establishment. Sitting alone at a chess board, he nods to his large guardian (in Mideastern attire and fez) at the entry door as to whether persons seeking entry are to be permitted or not. One man, tall and pompous, a key official (perhaps the head) of Deutsche Bank, gets a ""no"" nod from Rick. As he protests, Rick joins the guard at the door, and indicates the man must limit his patronage to the bar. As the man, protesting still, hands Rick his card, Rick rips it and tosses the pieces aside. ",r

An ex-pat American, he now runs a cafe, named after him, in Casablanca, Morocco. Its 1942 and many folks who want to escape Hitler arrive in Morocco to look for a visa to go to the United States. Not very many are successful. So, Rick sees desperate people every day at his establishment. Most of the time he is unmoved, as for some reason, Rick is a jaded fellow. However, he does come across a pair of valuable visas when someone trusts him to hid them in his piano player Sam's instrument. Not long after, ""THE WOMAN"", Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) comes into the place, asking Sam to play a song Rick has forbidden him to play. When he comes rushing to chastise him, he meets Ilsa. Flashing back, we learn that Ilsa had a grand love with Rick in Paris, just as the Nazis were getting closer and closer. Yet, when they made plans to escape on a train, Rick was jilted on the platform. No Ilsa arrived. Now, will Rick learn why this happened? Yes! Ilsa had a huge secret which comes spilling out, only to make Rick hurt all over again. In the meanwhile, the Germans in town are trying to find an escaped hero of their concentration camps, Victor (Paul Henreid). He is the most wanted man in Africa and word has it he's coming to Casablanca. Can Rick be an uncaring spectator forever? This beautiful, classic film has everything, as you have probably heard.

35,9 March 2006,Hitchcoc,10, One of our most quotable movies,"Not only have countless responders talked about this film; geniuses of the film criticism have picked it apart. Like so many of my most highly rated films, it's all about character. Someone said that modern film audiences don't see it as a classic. I love all kinds of movies. I am disappointed much more with contemporary films than older ones because filmmakers were forced to us a lot more imagination. Granted, there are many bad films in every era as well as great ones. When I see every reviewer start with an evaluation of special effects. Why is it that so many films need to rely on special effects. This movie is a romance of the highest order. It asks so much of its stars. The incredible lighting that accentuates the faces of the characters makes it all work. Then you have real stars in Bogie and Bergmann. Todays actors are so bland and interchangeable for the most part. There was a reason for a star system. Even today, I want to see the less glamorous actors: Hackman, Eastwood, etc. When Bergmann is on the screen, there is no one who can show the passion and pain that she does. Also, consider the vignettes concerning war embattled Casablanca. There is a force at work to destroy all that is good and right. The singing of the French national anthem is antithetical to that scene in Cabaret where the young Nazis sing ""The World Belongs to Me."" See this if you never have.",

38,26 August 2006,Quinoa1984,10, a classic that's known to people long before they actually see the movie,"For years when I was younger I thought I had seen Casablanca, but it wasn't until I was 17 that I actually SAW the entire thing from start to finish. Before that, I had seen some of the most indelible scenes from the picture (I don't remember them all, but one had Peter Lorre, another was when Bogie is drunk in the bar after the bar is closed and Bergman's Isla goes to him and he tells her off, another was, of course, the last scene). It's when one sees all of the story put together and all of those really terrfic scenes in the club that it really does gell as being a classic. It might not be up there for me with the very great films ever like Citizen Kane or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but there's never a minute, a line, or a performance in Casablanca that turns out to be dull or un-watchable. It's by turns very funny in a few spurts even though it's a romantic drama of the highest Hollywood order. For some on the level of movies dealing with loves lost and found and lost again it's no wonder that this takes the cake. Even the last scene, the lines of which have been parodied God knows how many times now, still has that ring of emotion in the greatest escapist sense.

I suppose like always, I'll start by detailing the plot, which I think is a lot less complicated than it appears, and how the movie's achievements in music, performances and everything else all come together to make an unforgettable experience. The story takes place in (true to the title) Casablanca, a city in the North African country of Morocco, which at this point in history is owned by France. In Casablanca, there's an American named Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) who owns a nightclub. On the face of it, he doesn't seem to be doing anything that would make the authorities mad, but Rick's place is frequented by just about every type of lowlife imaginable: pickpockets, pirates, assassins, and so on. Because the Second World War is on by now, Rick's place also gets a new kind of customer: Nazis. People also go to the nightclub in order to gain entry to America, as they didn't pick a side yet. One day, a criminal named Ugarte (Peter Lorre) tells Rick that he has ""acquired"" letters of transit that were taken off the corpses of two German messengers. These letters are a goldmine to refugees wanting to escape the purgatory that is Casablanca, as they allow the owner to move to Portugal, which is neutral. Ugarte doesn't plan on letting Rick hold onto the letters indefinitely, but before he can retrieve them from him, he's arrested. Ugarte then dies in custody, and the cops are unaware that the letters are still in Rick's possession. Meanwhile, a new patron named Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) enters the establishment, and comes face to face with the head of the nazi forces in Morocco, Major Heinrich Strasser (Conrad Veidt). Strasser talks with both Rick and Laszlo at a bar table, with Strasser taunting Victor about his place of origin. Being an underground partisan fighter for Czechoslovakia, Laszlo's home country has been invaded and basically enslaved by Hitler's Reich. Rick tells Strasser that despite the types of people that hang out in his nightclub, he has no allegiance to any of them. However, Strasser's entire reason for being in Casablanca is to lock up Victor, who is an enemy of the Fuhrer. Right after, Rick notices a woman in his bar who he has known previously, but is not happy to see. She is Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), Rick's former love interest when both of them were living in Paris. Rick has animosity towards her now because she decided to leave him without saying why. Laszlo later finds out from Signor Ferrari (Sydney Greenstreet), an associate of Rick's, that he has the transit letters on him, and is now wanting to buy them. Rick says no, telling him his wife Ilsa's treasonous actions have made him bitter. Laszlo then inspires everyone (barring the nazi officers) in the nightclub into a patriotic frenzy downstairs. Strasser, afraid of seeing his enemy so persuasive, orders the place to be closed because it hosts gambling. With everyone out of the bar, Ilsa sneaks in and demands Rick to give up the papers, which he again refuses to do. Threatening to shoot him, Rick says if Laszlo and his cause means that much to her, she shouldn't have a problem putting a bullet through him. Ilsa relents and starts detailing her past in order to fill the gaps in Rick's perception of her. Rick thinks she's treasonous and left him for no reason, but that's not true. It's explained that when she and Rick were in love in Paris, she thought Victor was killed by the germans for trying to escape from german captivity. Ilsa then found out Victor didn't actually die, but went into hiding. Ilsa was so worried with uncertainty that she had to go back and help him instead of staying with Rick. Once Rick's waiter sends Ilsa away in a car, Laszlo appears looking for refuge with Rick since the cops are now after him. Captain Renault, the corrupt police chief, arrests Laszlo, but Rick pressures for his release so that he can be arrested for the more severe crime of holding onto those letters instead. Rick lies and tells Renault he and Ilsa are going to fly to the US once Laszlo is arrested. However, once Renault tries to arrest Victor, Rick holds Renault at gunpoint and orders him to assist in his escape. Rick can escape if he wants to, but he wants to see Laszlo and Ilsa go free so that he can continue his fight against the nazis somewhere else. Ilsa doesn't want to leave Rick behind, but Rick tells her she'll regret it forever if she doesn't go. As she and her husband board a plane for portugal, Strasser, tipped off by Renault, pulls up to the runway in his staff car. When Strasser is informed that Laszlo is on the aircraft, he tries to contact the radio tower to stop their departure. Rick guns him down. As the plane lifts off, cops arrive to see the dead Strasser, but Renault tells them Rick wasn't responsible. As the former and the latter walk off into the fog, Renault suggests that Rick join up with the free french forces in the Congo. Like so many other films from the 1940s, Casablanca's reputation in modern cinema defies description. It's not hard to see why it is so praised today. Everything about it, from the acting, setting, storyline, soundtrack by Max Steiner, etc. All hold up really well. Most people watching today can't begin to imagine how groundbreaking it was back in 1942. It also just blows my mind to think that producer Hal Wallis' first choice to direct this movie was William Wyler, but he ended up choosing Michael Curtiz instead. With Wyler being among the best directors in history, it seems hard to believe that a movie like this could have been improved even more dramatically. That's not to say Curtiz didn't have a clue what he was doing. Like I said, the acting in Casablanca is some of the most classic you'll ever see. Even though Bogart's character isn't married to Bergman's, their relationship onscreen define the term ""classic Hollywood."" Just like any real relationship, she and Bogart mutually assist each other in making it more believable by getting mad at each other sometimes, and losing faith in each other. Bogart isn't happy to see her again at all, but it's all a misunderstanding. Unfortunately, by the time he realizes how lovely she really is, he decides the best course of action for her is to accompany her husband out of the country. The camerawork in this movie is also flawless, given that it was entrusted to Arthur Edeson, who also worked on such masterpieces as Frankenstein. Because of him, the movie contains a lot of shadows and I was actually surprised to learn this isn't considered a noir. Conrad Veidt playing Major Strasser is definitely one of the movie's strong points as well. A refugee who fled germany after the nazis rose to prominence, it's ironic and captivating seeing him play what I think is the greatest example of a no nonsense disciple of the Third Reich. In all, I think Casablanca might barely edge out Citizen Kane for being one of the world's best movies, as most of the people involved didn't think it was going to be that great. Bogart and those around him didn't know they were making history, but they did.",

46,5 April 2007,classicalsteve,10, Rick Makes the Heroic Choice: One of the Best Hollywood Films of All Time,"Many a-great film or theatrical play is about a character (or characters) making a monumental choice. The results of that choice may be tragic, such as Oedipus' decision to pursue the mystery of his parentage, MacBeth's resolve to assassinate his sovereign, or even when Gene decides to cause Finneas' accident in ""A Separate Peace"". The choice can also be selfless, heroic, even transcendent. Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" agrees to defend a black man that prompts ridicule by his white peers. The passengers of the doomed cargo plane in ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" determine not to lay down and die in the desert but rebuild something from the wreckage that could save them.

50,16 February 2004,Coventry,10," Here's looking at cinema-perfection, kid","Out of all the films that are considered classic milestones in cinemahow many fully deserve that status?? Not that many, let me tell youbut Casablanca absolutely does! Casablanca has become history itself, a legendary production that'll live on forever. And it should! This film is essential viewing for everyone who ever showed interest in cinema. Every sequence in Casablanca is brilliant, every character is intriguing and every setting is breath taking. Especially when you're watching it for the first timeyou'll be surprised how much you actually know about it already. Multiple ideas, lines and sequences were so influential and important to cinema, that they have been used numberless times afterwards. You might even say that cinema would have looked completely different if it wasn't for Casablanca. It's a brilliant love-story with irresistible film-noir and comedy aspects. The entire script - line by line - is pure nostalgic and some of the dialogues originally shown here grew out to become pure historical art. This intelligent movie also depends a lot on its superb cast, of course. Bogart portrays a terrific character herea performance that yet has to find its equal. His brute and heartless portrayal of Rick is fascinating, especially because you soon find out that he is in fact just a hurt romanticist, heart-broken by a girl who's about to show up again. This girl (the stunning Ingrid Bergman) is practically the most marvelous lady who ever appeared on the big screen. Thanks to her natural charm and beauty, Bergman makes the most out of Ilsa. Film-noir stars Claude Rains and Peter Lorre supply the film with terrific supporting characters and a right amount of humor and parody. It's amazing how this film combines so many different genres successfully. The cruelty and drama of the war and the rise of the 'Third Empire' is mixed with comedy and romance in a unique way. It cannot be deniedCasablanca is pure perfection and everyone should appreciate it. This film isn't to be missed by anyone, whether you're young, middle-aged or retiredthis film will move you.",

From opportunists, to isolationists - from patriots to disenchanted lovers - the film has everything a man or woman would enjoy.  Bravery, courage, intrigue, romance, beauty and love. Leading actors to please any appetite.  Watching this film is to step back to a world that doesn't exist - yet to know it.  It is to experience lives that have never been lived - but are ""real to you.""

This film evokes a romantic humanism into the thick of World War II!!! Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are magnificent as the tormented love interest duo who do not seem to be able to piece everything together, they just know they love each other, and more importantly, something clicks!!! Originally, Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheriden were cast for the roles of Rick and Ilsa, as it turns out, you cannot imagine any two other people besides Humphry Bogart and Ingrid Bergman for the roles!! These two performers exude more of a continental flair!! The American fascination for this flick is thoroughly justified!! Winning the academy award for best picture in 1943, ""Casablanca"" was just one of the many movies in the late 1930's and early 1940's which epitomized an era for excellent movies!! Based on the book ""Everybody Comes To Ricks"", Hal B. Wallis produces this film with a flawless orchestration!! The place, Casablanca, becomes a citadel of despondence and despair for so many people, yet for Rick and Ilsa, (Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman) the situation is tailor made for a passionate redemption!! Max Steiner encompasses a necessary nostalgia with the music in this film. ""As Time Goes By"" (made in 1931) became enormously popular with this movie!! The whole scene is set up whereby Paris becomes a venue for unprecedented and wondrous romanticism!! ""Casablanca"" is, without question, one of the greatest movies ever made!! You must remember this, a movie is just a movie!! Unless!! It is the movie of all time; ""Casablanca""!! I will see ""Casablanca"" over and over and over again and never be tired of it!! EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE!! I guarantee you, you will not be disappointed!!! This film has 6 of the top 100 famous quotes in the history of all American film making!! Humphrey Bogart and Marlon Brando may lay claim to the most quotes from this list. Many colloquialisms from ""Casablanca"" have fallen within the realm of popular modern day jargon!! This website ranks ""Casablanca"" 11th best picture out of the top 250. AFI (American Film Institue) ranks ""Casablanca"" the second best American film ever made. I feel this is very impressive!!

Rick is a bitter and cynical man that neither drinks with costumers nor involves with women, and does not stick his neck out for anyone, keeping a neutral political position in times of war. Rick has a good relationship with the corrupt French Chief of Police Captain Renault (Claude Rains), who is bribed to cover the existence of Rick's casino and protect the place.

Of course, the more you do know about CASABLANCA the clearer the in-jokes and the subtle yet potent lines become: as a matter of fact, CASABLANCA has now become one of the most quoted pictures of the last one hundred years. With a convoluted story which is really a romantic love affair between Rick, Ilsa, and her husband Victor Lazlo as well as a denouncement of the Nazis in this otherwise relatively safe haven that is Rick's cafe in Casablanca, Morocco, CASABLANCA becomes a ferociously sophisticated tale that has overtones of film-noir and that overwhelming chemistry that both Bogart and Bergman possess, their romance surpassing everything else and being the barometer for which romantic drama has been measured up against. If anything, of the supporting cast, Paul Henreid, for all his third billing, is the more thankless since he doesn't get much to do other than play the somewhat befuddled Lazlo (although he does get to find out that Rick and Ilsa have a little more than common than they'd like to admit).

The love story between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman is for me just one of the stories that unfold against a background of near hopeless refuge. I saw this film many, many years ago and I was too young to believe in it. Now I believe in it all and am amazed at how much male sorrow it shows. Bogart has never been more human trying to dismiss his past with Bergman in Paris, and now she turns up in his cafe in Casablanca but not alone. He almost literally falls apart overwhelmed by the depth of his feelings. I have never considered Ingrid Bergman to be a great actor but briefly in this film she shines with a bewildered authenticity, the camera and the director capturing her just at the right moments. This film is one of the best to come out of Hollywood, and although some respected critics find fault with it I do not. It is not a mess of a film, but perfectly coherent and easy to follow. Every scene has nuances, humour, despair and divided loyalties. What more do you want from a film, and it was also brilliantly directed by Michael Curtiz and its whole cast cannot be faulted.

The movie starts with Rick Blaine, portrayed brilliantly by Bogart, who owns a night club called ""Rick's Cafe American"", during December 1941 in the city of Casablanca. Set years after a devastating separation between he and a long-lost loved one, that particular woman, portrayed beautifully by Ingrid Bergman, who shined on screen, returns with a new husband who is on the run for the law, but she also faces serious love connections with a heartbroken Rick. Beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz, and written brilliantly by three or four separate screenwriters, ""Casablanca"" is one of the greatest movies ever made.

""Casablanca"" is a noirish melodrama set against the back-drop of WWII and Europeans fleeing to America by way of French Morocco. What's so refreshing about it, in spite of its classical love triangle theatrics, is that is never places romantic love on a pedestal.  It realizes that in a world of uncertainty where neutrality is the biggest crime, there are more noble things than love.  ",

He compared this movie to a similar film, Citizen Kane. He claimed that Kane may be the better movie, but Casablanca is the more popular movie. I agree with Roger because Casablanca is one of the best movies ever made and it seems as if my opinion is a fact (although keep in mind all movies are subjective). There is just so much to admire about the film. The cast, the themes, the actual production of the movie, and the way the film influenced future movies just to name a few. We wouldn't get star-studded romantic epics like 1997's Titanic if this film bombed at the box office or was not even made. Fortunately, this movie was a giant success both financially and critically. It was nominated for ten Academy Awards, winning three of them including Best Picture which it is rightfully deserved. ",

Mickey Rooney in ""The Human Comedy""? J.

Maybe these gray characters are truly out for themselves and see it as a game or a matter of survival - Claude Rains's Captain Renault, or maybe they were fighters for the good fight at one time and when karma dealt them a bad blow they became cynical - Bogart's Rick Blaine.",

93,19 April 2011,charlytully,10, Holds its own against most Shakespeare plays,"Looking at the list or compilation here on IMDb of notable quotes from the film CASABLANCA, I was reminded of at least 28 sayings that have become part of the American lexicon or our shared cultural literacy in the nearly 7 decades since this movie's release (a time period similar to the one that Abraham Lincoln observed had elapsed between the Declaration of Independence and his own Gettysburg Address). The 30-odd plays attributed to William Shakespeare have some advantages over CASABLANCA in terms of grasping ""market share"" in our collective mentality: namely, they've had six times as long to take root in our imaginative vocabulary, which consequently has yielded far more adaptations (think current release GNOMEO AND JULIET) than time has proffered to the script which earned screen writing Oscars for the Epstein twins. On the other hand, only serious Shakespeare scholars would be able to identify two dozen memorable turns of phrase from the entire body of the bard's work, and many of these professorial types probably would be stumped to repeat ANY bon mot from 10 or 20 of the lesser known plays (all of which necessarily suffer from archaic words or meanings caused by the passage of the centuries). As stated in the quote section here, some CASABLANCA trademarks (""Here's looking at you, kid"") predate the movie, while other famous lines (""Play it again, Sam"") have been ""edited"" for conciseness in the public mind. Back in school, I learned enough about Shakespeare to know the exact same thing applies to most of his famous one-liners: he was primarily popularizing stories and sayings that predated the dramas performed under his brand. (Much of the foregoing also could be applied to biblical scholarship, but I will leave it to the next reviewer to extrapolate between CASABLANCA and comparative religion.)",

Okay, it isn't my favorite World War II Warner Brothers film, but it is a grand movie. Yes, ""Casablanca"" is worth watching, and I've lost track of the number of times that I have seen this splendidly made black & white film. Undoubtedly, the Warner Brothers film Casablanca ranks as one of the most famous and most written about commercial films that the studio produced during World War II. Aljean Harmetz dedicated an entire book to this classic romantic melodrama, ""Round Up the Usual Suspects: The Making of Casablanca."" Her work is the seminal account about the production of the film. Ironically, according to Harmetz, MGM producer Sam Marx wanted to buy the unproduced play ""Everybody Comes to Rick's"" by Murray Burnett and Joan Allison, which was the basis of the movie, but MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer ""didn't think it was worth the money.""",
95,15 September 2019,Uriah43,10, One of the Best Films Ever Made,"With the Nazis having already occupied France and conquered much of Eastern Europe, a stream of refugees desperately attempt to get to America by embarking on a tortuous path which includes getting to the small city of Casablanca in French Morocco and from there to Lisbon. However, as difficult as it is for these refugees to actually get to Casablanca, their travel is further complicated by the fact that nobody is allowed to take the daily flight from there to Lisbon without the written permission of the corrupt Vichy French police commander by the name of ""Captain Louis Renault"" (Claude Rains). So quite often these refugees have to wait for quite a long time and this-in and of itself-creates even more of a financial and logistical hardship upon them. So in an effort to find a solution to their problem or temporarily forget about their troubles, many of them flock to the most popular nightclub there known as ""Rick's Café Americain"" which is owned by a tough and worldly American expatriate named ""Rick Blaine"" (Humphrey Bogart). Yet, even though he is quite successful in Casablanca, he finds it hard to find any great happiness due to a previous romance which devastated him a year and a half earlier. However, things take a sudden turn for the worse when a famous anti-German activist named ""Victor Laszlo"" (Paul Henreid) walks into his nightclub-and with him is the woman who broke his heart that bleak and rainy day in Paris. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is not only my favorite movie of all time but is also considered to be one of the best films ever made with a number of movie stars possibly turning in the best performances of their careers. I especially liked the chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman (as ""Ilsa Lund"") along with the performance of Dooley Wilson as Rick's loyal companion ""Sam"". Be that as it may, I believe that this is one of the very few films that each and every viewer ought to see at least once and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. A classic in every sense of the word.",

97,24 July 2021,rogerhwerner,10, Ten Stars Says it all,"This film started life as just another Warner pot boiler. No one involved thought of it as even potentially great. The script writing often progressed from day-to-day and the actors were bit players or not well known character actors. Many of the actors were recently arrived war refugees. Bogart was known for his gangster films where most of the time he dies ignominiously. Ingrid Bergman was largely unknown outside of Sweden and her beauty alone makes the picture worth a view. Today, most critics rank this film as the greatest ever made and I've no doubt they're correct. Much of its dialog has become iconic and has beome part of popular culture. The ending is breathtaking in it's simplicity and it is honestly without equal with one possible exception. I've seen this movie so many times that I've memorized the dialog and it always effects me in a way no other film does. Younger audiences complain about the black and white filmography, often overly dramatic 1940s acting style, and lack sex, violence, car crashes, and explosions. This film, thankfully, is guilty of all these points. Look past the typical triteness of modern cinema and see a film that's almost in a class by itself and has come to define a great movie.",

The script crackles with quotable lines; the classic song ""As Time Goes By"" lovingly serenades every frame; delicious characters populate every moment. Humphrey Bogart's bar owner cynic is hilarious and pathetic today as he was 55 years ago. Claude Rains's ambiguous little policeman is a delightful caricature. And Ingrid Bergman, whose beauty is to this day is unsurpassed, lights up every frame with her luminous presence. Definitely one for the library!",

It has given the English language more well-known quotations than virtually any other film- ""Here's looking at you, kid"", ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"", ""Round up the usual suspects"", ""We'll always have Paris"", ""Play it again, Sam"" (yes, I know that one's a misquote) and ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine"" (also often misquoted, generally as ""Of all the bars.."").

100,19 June 2008,griffolyon12,10," A timeless classic, that is one of the finest films of all-time!","Casablanca is one of those rare films that truly qualifies as a perfect film. There is absolutely nothing bad about this film, this is a timeless classic that is still as relevant to today's society as it was back in 1942. Many of the themes in Casablanca can still be seen in action in today's world, but what truly makes Casablanca transcend generations is the love story. The love triangle between Rick, Ilsa, and Laszlo is one of the finest triangles in movie history; as much as you want to hate Laszlo so Rick and Ilsa will get together, Laszlo is just such a likable character you can't hate him, and you just know deep down Rick will not take Ilsa away from Laszlo. Of course what truly keeps this film from being a monotonous three-way love story, is the colorful cast of characters surrounding the three leads, in particular the scene stealing Captain Renault played brilliantly by Claude Rains. Of course what has always made me love this film isn't the brilliant characters or the love story, it is in fact the screenplay. The screenplay is one of the finest ever crafted in the history of film, each scene flows perfectly, never feeling too long or too short; as well the film features some of the finest dialogue ever spoken in a movie, there are just so many quotable lines from this movie. Overall Casablanca is just truly a masterpiece, and if you have never seen it I suggest you do because it is one of the greatest films ever made.",

But what elevates this film from a simple love story to a sublime uplifting film is the theme of sacrificing one's own love for the greater good and the love of others. The pace of the film crackles. It just moves. It doesn't dwell on shorts. Every shot has all of this visual information, but you're not given a lot of time to process it, which is why it holds up to repeated viewing, because you've missed so much of it. The pace of the film conveys that urgency in a dangerous world.",
103,16 October 2012,ChristophCinema,10, 11 out of 10 Stars,"What can you say about Casablanca? I'm serious. What can be said about it? It's one of the greatest films of all time and everybody already knows it. This movie is so perfect, that it actually brings tears to my eyes. The acting, the characters, the story, the quotes, the humor, the drama, the atmosphere; everything is just perfect. This is what classics are made of. Picking my favorite thing about this movie is almost impossible because everything goes together hand in hand. But if I had to pick 2 things that make this movie great, it would have to be the two main characters, and the world the movie transports you to. First of all, the two leads. Humphrey Bogart is the man. He's always the man. I've never seen a movie where he wasn't the man. Why is he considered the ""Greatest Actor of All Time""? Because he's Humphrey Bogart, that's why. I think Humphrey Bogart perfected the concept of an ""imperfect hero"". From the very beginning, you see that people would die for him, but he wouldn't do the same. He claims to be neutral, but you're never sure which side he's really on. He's so calm and mysterious, but his decisions are based mostly on his unpredictable emotions. He has such a presence to him, but you're constantly wondering if he'll do the right thing in the end. Ingrid Bergman is also amazing playing opposite of Humphrey Bogart. Just like Bogart, she is very mysterious, and you want to know more about her. She also goes above and beyond the typical 1940s female performance. She gets so into the role, it may actually be the most emotional performance I've ever seen from this time period. These two are just perfect together. I love how most of the movie, we're left in the dark about their relationship. All we know is that these two knew each other at one point, and that they once had something. I love how most of the backstory can be seen in the faces of the two main actors. The movie doesn't even need that flashback scene, because you can see how important these two are to each other just by looking at their faces. The flashback scene is great, but I think it would've been cooler if the whole movie, we didn't know their history together. The last thing that I love about this movie is the world. This movie is classic Hollywood fantasy world, and it sure knows how to suck you right in. This isn't real life, it's the movie world; and that's what makes this movie so classic. Even though it has that 1940s acting, and many of the clichés of the time, it still remains timeless. It's all fun, from beginning to end. You may feel like you're watching a movie, but that's just because you are. This is what movies are all about. They're not about showing us what life is really like; they're about letting us escape to a world where life is more interesting. Like I said, this movie just defines ""classic"". The characters are unforgettable, the scenes are so memorized, and the quotes are so recognizable (it's no wonder this film may be the most referenced/spoofed/quoted film of all time). This film is so perfect, it gets better and better each time I see it. It's so classic; it kind of hurts. So bottom line.it's alright.",
104,17 January 2010,kenjha,10, You Must Remember This,"It doesn't get much better than this drama about war time intrigue and romance. Bogart gives the best performance of his storied career in the quintessential role of the tough, cynical loner with a soft heart. Bergman is simply luminous. Henried does well in a thankless role. Rains nearly steals the film as a crooked but lovable police inspector. The script has more memorable lines than any other, the cinematography is crisp, and nobody sings ""As Time Goes By"" like Wilson. Curtiz, an underrated director, deserves much of the credit for the iconic images of this unforgettable classic. Thankfully, to paraphrase a line from the film, we'll always have ""Casablanca.""",

No other masterwork of the silver screen has timelessly depicted the tale of two star-crossed lovers and the hand of destiny. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman created one of the greatest onscreen romances in film history. The aesthetic black and white, the memorable one-liners, the fashion, the stirring theme song, the flawless acting and the simple, direct unfolding of the story all rounding up to one of the most unforgettable endings in all of filmdom and one knows one is in the midst of a classic.

Bogart is so ideally cast, the minute you see him on-screen in his white tuxedo jacket is a welcome sight. Bergman is somehow less interesting, and director Michael Curtiz keeps her crying all the time (usually in close-up), which, although appropriately tender and moving, becomes repetitive. The screenplay, reportedly the victim of frequent change on the set, is loosely structured and is often handled indifferently by Curtiz, who nevertheless stages some classic sequences, particularly the finale at the airport. But what does Rick mean by his line, ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship""? Has Ilsa's emotional devotion sworn him off women for good?

157,7 April 2018,theterminator-92378,9, a war time love story that has touched our hearts,"Casablanca is defined as one of the best love storys of all time and it in my opinion it is because it shows the difficulty of love and that sometimes you have to let go the one you love and it does this perfectly.
Humprey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are our two stars and these two have an amazing chemistry and you can tell that their charcters Rick and Illsa do love each other and they have a intimte relationship before the events of the war split them up and they only have the memories of Paris. The supporting cast of Paul Henreid,Claude Rains,Conrad Veidt,Sydney Greenstreet,Peter Lorre.S.Z. Sakall,Madeleine Lebeau and Dooley Wilson this is a supporting cast that defines what it means to be a supporting actor while we don't see much of these characters when we do they really bring out there acting talent and it shines through. Casablanca is also one of those movies that extremely quoteable the iconic quotes are like ""Round up the usual suspects"" ""heres looking at you kid"" ""We'll Always have Paris"" ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in the world she had to walk into mine"" ""play it again sam"" and ""Louis I think this is the begining of a beatiful friendship"" these are cinemas best quotes and they all come from this great movie.

158,27 June 2003,SilkTork,10, Why Does It Work?,"This is a movie so flawed it is in danger of falling apart. Bergman is cold, confused and remote - unconvincing as the woman who dominates the lives of the mysterious and highly respected American Rick Blaine, and the much sought after inspiration of the resistance Victor Laszlo. The Paris sequence is corny and embarrassing producing one of the worse lines in cinema history - ""Was that cannon fire or is my heart pounding?"" Yet this film remains my all time favourite. No matter how many times I see it I'm still moved. I get goosebumps when Laszlo encourages the staff and customers of Rick's to sing La Marseilles in response to the Germans singing. I smile at the jokes. I melt at the supreme sacrifice at the end. I nod knowingly at the references to America's neutral stance in the war. I admire the theme of commitment and sacrifice in a time of stress. And I love the colourful, quickly drawn characters given vivid life by smooth, confident actors such as Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. Why does it work so well? Is it Bogart in a white suit? Is it the impressionist tour de force opening where every character and every theme is introduced in a fluid journey through Rick's bar? Or is it the totally unpredictable and totally original story-line the conclusion of which could never be guessed, but which feels so right, so heroic, so romantic, so awesome. ""Here's looking at you, kid!""",

161,28 December 2013,iamyuno2,10, The Best of the Best,"I never get tired of this film - no matter how many times I've seen it. And every player in this film - from S.Z. Sakall and Dooley Wilson to Bogart, Claude Rains, Paul Henreid and Ingrid Bergman - is absolutely brilliant. More emotion you'll never see in a film - for my money. These actors are fully vested in this film and more complex and nuanced performances you'll never see. Every aspect of this film is genius - from the story to the cinematography (and...I'm not sure...but could one argue that this was the very first and very best example of the film noire genre - does this qualify? It certainly sets the standard.) The tension is palpable, the dialog crackles with wit and intensity...for my money this is impossible to top. And it stays taught right to the very end...and who could argue that the very last line isn't the very best and most memorable in film history (in a film replete with memorable lines)? It's a great romance, a great thriller, a great War movie...it succeeds on so many levels - most EVERY level. And it is so riveting! It thrills from start to finish. And these are characters that not only love people and truly love each other, which makes you care all the more about their fates. These are characters you fall in love with and come to admire deeply, for the heroism they display in the face of almost insurmountable odds. (Can anyone not be moved by Sam's devotion to his bristly boss, Rick? That relationship defines the word ""true friend."" I had a friend like that once - they do exist - but they are a rare breed...and how moving is it to see this kind of thing in action in Casablanca?!) These characters are examples for us all - and though imaginary, they are recreations of real heroes who existed at the time and defeated the forces of evil in World War II. Bogie fans, of course, will love this film (it is arguably his finest...which is saying a lot, since his performances in The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Key Largo and many other films were brilliant too), as will Ingrid Bergman fans (her performance here rivals her performance in Notorious)...but you don't have to be a fan of any of them to recognize their greatness in Casablanca. (Peter Lorre deserves a mention too - his work here is memorable and noteworthy; it's a shame he wasted his great talent in too many lesser films afterward - except, of course, for The Maltese Falcon, his re-pairing with Bogie - which made for a wonderful chemistry.)

It also broke social ground, with Sam the pianist (Dooley Wilson) being one of the first black roles to be treated as (almost) an equal. Most of all, it's a film you can watch again and again.

174,15 October 2012,miss_flowers,10, Incredible!,"I watched Casablanca for a class, and, while I initially thought that I wouldn't care for it, I find myself being able to confidently say that it's actually one of my favorite movies, not just from the class but also in general. In terms of acting character and plot the movie is just superb, the best performance being, obviously, from Humphrey Bogart. Technically, the movie is one of the best that I've seen from that period of time. The camera is EXTREMELY mobile, especially in Rick's Café, moving between the tables and sweeping the expanse of the dining room. The sweeps of the streets were incredible, and the shots seemed to be getting longer, which was nice to see. The most notable thing, technically, was the sweep of the airport as Ilsa and Laszlo's plane takes off. Overall an amazing movie, something I would definitely recommend both for the storyline and for the technical elements.",

Then, it just never stops beautifully showing us everything just as we need to know it. It reveals to us Rick's backstory slowly, but all in perfect timing. Honestly, it might be a perfectly paced movie. The dialogue is some of the best in any movie, period. Some of the most iconic movie quotes of all-time come from this film, such as ""Here's looking at you kid."" It's an amazing movie all around that will keep your eyes glued to the screen wondering what happens next.

This is a freeze frame of American war propaganda at its highest point, with an array of America's greatest filmmakers collaborating at the beginning of World War II, right after the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is a work that will always be seen and be honored as the epitome of world film-art that it is. Don't take anything for granted when you watch this movie.

180,22 December 2004,ACitizenCalledKane,10, One of the greatest motion pictures of all time!,"When Michael Curtiz' film, Casablanca, left Warner Bros. studio and hit the silver screen in 1942, it was intended to be a well-received box-office success. It had a star-studded cast, a fine director, and very talented writers. What more does a film need to be successful? Needless to say, Casablanca more than surpassed all expectations. It won three Academy Awards (Best Director, Picture, and Screenplay) in 1943. That, in of itself, is impressive for a movie that was produced in much the same way as about fifty-one other pictures that were produced by Warner Bros. that year. Granted, this movie did have a lot going for it, but there was some confusion during the making of it, like, trying to decide on an ending, for example. The ending was a last-minute thought by the writers, and so Ingrid Bergman was likely just as surprised to hear it as her on-screen persona, Ilsa. The ending, like the entire film, has, of course gone down in movie history as being one of the more memorable endings of all time. In retrospect, all of the honors and success that Casablanca received was nothing in comparison to the impact that it has had ever since it came out.",

And of course there are all those great players starting with Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman whose only teaming on film this was and who made such a great romantic couple here. Paul Henreid as Ingrid's other leading man wasn't so bad either especially during that ""dueling anthems"" scene. Then there's Claude Rains as the French prefect whose loyalties are constantly tested for him and us. And, finally, Dooley Wilson is aces especially when singing ""As Time Goes By"". Really, I'll just now say Mom and me definitely highly recommend Casablanca and leave it at that! P.S. Since my favorite movie is It's a Wonderful Life, I have to again cite someone from that movie that's also in another one I'm reviewing.

It stars Humphrey Bogart as a no nonsense nightclub owner during the second world war who is haunted by past romance. Ingrid Bergman reenters his life and all the memories return. She is now married to a fighter-resistant man who wishes to shelter himself in Bogart's nightclub. He evaporates into alcohol reflecting upon the last time he saw her. A masterpiece that avoids the predictable and goes for the emotional struggle. Directed by Michael Curtiz who previously made The Adventures of Robin Hood. Bogart flawlessly portraying a man struggling with brokenness and a crossroad of right and wrong. Bergman is terrific as a woman emotionally entangled within the past and present. In supporting roles are Claude Rains as a police chief who delivers the cheerful and much quoted final line. Paul Henreid plays Bergman's underground husband who must rely on his wife's former lover's integrity to survive. Peter Lorre also appears briefly in one of his sinister roles that he plays so well. This time his luck runs out when Bogart exposes him. The question arises as to whether this film is as great as its reputation claims. In answer, it is an accurate portrayal of love in its most glorious form. Score: 10 / 10",

I'm not gonna go on and on with the story because it just spoils it and plus this is a review not a plot summary.

The story is perfectly crafted, intersecting a love triangle with the crushing pressures of wartime, and It's perfectly told by Director Michael Curtiz, with a flashback, a few surprises, and not a single wasted shot. Most importantly, the film captures the feeling of those huge moments in life that we'll always remember, where everything in one's life pivots, as well as the pain of love lost. Bogart holding that note in the rain, the ink beginning to run down as he's urged to get on the train, is later mirrored by him watching the plane disappear into the fog, the signal light reducing to a pinprick, and both moments are incredibly poignant.",

Peter Lorre gives one of the most memorable performances of his career, even though his screen time is roughly four minutes.

I also think the camera movements like quick zooms or when the camera moved up to a character, or shots like of the entire club were revolutionary and you can definitely see the influence of the camera work in later films. I feel like this is the film or one of the films in which our cinematic history transitions into the modern period with acting and camera-work the kind that were used to, the film strangely didn't feel old to me it looked and flowed like it could have been made yesterday.

It is a bit cliqued, but perhaps it was not that way when it was first released, but over the years the lines have been repeated so much that it has become that way. This is a wonderful, complex story, which is one of the things I like about it and other movies with great plots. But it was not too confusing. There were things that I had not noticed on previous viewings, one of which is the use of lighting. I found myself wondering what it meant when they showed Rick's shadow much larger than himself in one scene. Did it mean that he was a mere shadow of himself after Elsa left him alone at the train station? I've never really paid much attention to the beginning scene and realize how it really set the stage for the rest of the film (the mise on scene). It really was quite disturbing how the German invasion impacted all of Europe and all of the refugees were forced to Casablanca. This sort of contrasted with the setting of Rick's-brightly lit, music, drinking. etc. The best scene is when Rick lets the young girl's husband win enough at the Roulette table to buy letters to allow them to leave Casablanca-a real tear jerker",

I had planned for some time that this would be my 600th review and I think it's very fitting. Is Casablanca truly the magnificent piece of cinematic history or does it simply have something that many classics are fortunate to have...cine-magic as I will call it. Some films just have this style, this charisma, the perfect balance of the something special that makes them endearing to millions and I think Casablanca is the perfect example of this. Furthermore Casablanca is often known as one of the 'greatest romance films of all time' but despite the romantic undertone the film is more of a World War II drama about patriotism and escaping the Nazi grip on the area. For its time, and the film certainly is timeless, but the gritty, dark setting sets a tone for danger and intrigue and mystery and even that romance. The characters are so sleek and have so much depth and you are just immediately enthralled with this story and this beautiful Casablanca world. The true brilliance of watching Casablanca now is feeling the classic aura.

Basically, set in World War II, many Europeans are trying to get into America to escape the threat of the Germans, but to do that they have to go to Casablanca, Morocco and get a visa. A hot spot in the town is Rick's Cafem run by American exile Rick Blaine (Oscar nominated Humphrey Bogart), who is shocked to see his past lover Ilsa Lund (Ingrib Bergman) walk into his place. He has a flashback about what he and Ilsa used to get up to when they were in love, and now she is married after running away to Paris. He has other problems however, Ugarte (Peter Lorre) has given him important transit letters, Nazi officer Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt) is snooping around, and police Captain Renault (Claude Rains) tries to make the Nazi happy detaining Czech underground leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). In the end, to save her husband's life, Rick forces Ilsa to board a plane leaving the country, the letters are given to the right people, and when Rick looked like he was going to be in trouble he was saved by his new friend. Also starring Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari, S.Z. Sakall as Carl, Madeleine Lebeau as Yvonne and Dooley Wilson as Sam. I personally think that this film is a little overrated, Bogart is really good, Bergman is beautiful and the supporting cast all do good too, and the score is great. My concern is that the only thing I will ever remember are the memorable catchphrases and little love story in amongst everything else which I find a little confusing and too political, but it's not a bad film at all, it is a classic wartime romantic drama to see.

This movie is a timeless classic, which stands alone and cannot be replicated. I know that countless words have been written about this movie, so anything I say will probably be nothing new, but I'll say it anyway. This movie could have easily become some kind of corny and phony contrivance about some ex-patriot loser who is wallowing in self-pity because some woman led him on and then gave him the old ""heave-ho."" This movie could have easily become little more than just another World War Two movie, with the good guys vs the bad guys, with the latter getting everything they deserve. But this movie goes way beyond that, and is a work of art. Now this may sound like a cliché, but it isn't. This movie actually conveys a story that is both complex and compelling and contains some really great acting which transforms the script into something that the audience can actually listen to and follow without trying to figure out what's going on. Many of the characters in this movie are intrinsically unattractive and unlikable, but when mixed together, they emerge as some of the most memorable characters in the history of American cinema. I won't rehash this movie because anyone who knows cinema has undoubtedly already seen it. But suffice it to say, this movie is one-of-a-kind and should be treated as such.",

220,11 June 2008,ackstasis,10," ""I remember every detail. The Germans wore grey, you wore blue.""","Ah, 'Casablanca.' What other film can evoke such powerful feelings of nostalgia, can exemplify so completely the golden period of Hollywood film-making? The year was 1942, and the world found itself in the midst of the bloodiest conflict in modern history. Unlike anything our generation could possibly imagine, citizens were faced with an incredible uncertainty about their future. The Nazis marched across Europe, an astonishing, seemingly-unstoppable enemy, and the United States watched with bated breath from across the Atlantic. Most Hollywood productions responded to such ambiguity with fully-fledged, unabashed patriotism, and war-time filmmakers became obsessed with validating audiences' beliefs that the Allied forces would inevitably win out against Germany, and, indeed, many often concluded their pictures with unnecessary epilogues in which we've apparently already won. Such propaganda, while no doubt ensuring commercial success from war-weary cinema-goers, has regularly tarnished and outdated even the most otherwise-impressive contemporary WWII pictures, as the directors' willingness to simulate a happy ending strikes distinctly false from an era in which the overwhelming atmosphere was that of uncertainty and insecurity (see Billy Wilder's 'Five Graves to Cairo (1943)).",

It is generally not my favorite genre of movie but the raw emotion present throughout this masterpiece greatly moved me. The cinematography of this film is just absolutely beautiful. Every scene seems like it was shot less as a method of capturing a story, but more as if trying to paint a beautiful picture. The sets sometimes seem to frame characters at important moments in the plot and the heavy use of contrast to create very shadowy scenes sets the mood for a mysterious romance so perfectly that you can only call it a masterpiece. I found the acting to be masterful. The characters that the actors and actresses portrayed were done so flawlessly that i couldn't find a single character who i didn't think was portrayed beautifully.

At the time it was made, it was put together in a rush by a whole group of different scriptwriters, with most of the people involved in the film seeing it as nothing special. I agree with them! I found it generally trite and predictable. Almost everything about this film is artificial - the setting, the plot and the ending, as is normally the case in wartime propaganda films hastily put-together or not. The person whose fate we are supposed to care about is presented one-dimensionally, whilst the characteristic which defines Bogart for what he is (hard-bitten worldly cynicsym) is the characteristic he will have to lose if the film is to have a schmaltzy ending. What is his real motivation? Why does he do the things he does? There is really no character development at all. Does he believe in ideals and if he does do they have to be other people's? Or is he just chivalrous, or even whimsical or perverse? At a time when the British Empire was close to exhaustion and millions had died in Russia and central Europe, there is a little too much of the lone American saving the conscience of the world about it for comfort. Of course, the makers of the film only ever intended to make a simple propaganda film and they did their job well.They gave the audience the Bogey they wanted and were suitably rewarded with affection from more than one generation of filmgoers.

Casablanca is after all a romance, and like Captain Renault, many expected a romance.

This movie was made when nobody was sure who would win, and it shows.  The desperation of the characters, from Rick himself to bit parts that receive only five seconds of screen time, comes across perfectly without being over-stated or glossed over to give the love triangle more screen time.

Still to this day, it holds a lot of the weight. It's not a romance that many would expect for the praises it gets it's a very somber style of romance. The chemistry between Rick and Ilsa is not as lovey-dovey. Rick just has this bitterness to him the whole film, but you can see how he's hurting. How does he just feel like a broken person just getting by from his sarcasm Just as Ilsa's feelings conflict with her love for Lazlo and his Cause to the world.

Overall it is just a classy movie it has love, a powerful message, and memorable characters. Honestly my favorite it's not even Boggart or Bergman. It's Claude Rain as Captain Louis Renault.

262,13 March 2021,theognis-80821,10, Masterpiece,"A great movie, perfect in its dialogue, staging, casting, performance, and scoring, with a well-structured script that veers deftly between sentiment and logic. To say that the Oscar-winning script is brilliant is to underestimate it. The dramatic camera movements of Michael Curtiz are never put to better use than they are here. I'm very concerned however by the remarks of Ben Mankiewicz and Eddie Muller, which may be heard by young people watching this movie on TCM in the future and which may color their appraisals: the Letters of Transit are important. Nazi Germany did not exist in a vacuum. As historian Richard Overy, among others, has pointed out, the outcome of the war was not a certainty when this picture was made. Germany had important allies (Italy and Japan) and friends (Rumania, Spain, Portugal, and official France). Certainly, Hitler violated major agreements with Chamberlain and Molotov, but Germany could not casually violate ALL agreements with ALL countries ALL the time. It would be more important to respect Vichy than to keep Victor Laszlo in Casablanca. (Throughout, Conrad Veidt turns to Claude Rains for affirmation.) Mankiewicz and Muller make a living by talking and seem inclined to give more credit to the oratory of Victor Laszlo than it deserves. Wars are not won by oratory, but by logistics. The war was not won by inspiring words from FDR and Churchill or by the Resistance; it was won by the lives of tens of millions of people, nearly all Soviets, whose sentiments may have been articulated by Laszlo, but whether or not he escapes Casablanca is not determinative of anything.

It had an array of comical and lovable characters that I couldn't help finding myself wishing that they'd have a happy ending. Especially Sam, the piano player, although he barely said two words throughout the film his charisma and cheerfulness in an otherwise very depressed time made him so lovable as a character.

Their romance is beautiful and the effect that leaving one another has on them is utterly tragic. Watching Rick brood while throwing back shot after shot the night after his first encounter with Ilsa in years is one of the most brutal and well acted scenes I've ever witnessed. He pours his heart and soul into the performance, as does Bergman, and everything about watching them is just sensational. You just know that you're watching magic.

Probably due to the fact that i read somewhere once that one of the my favorite movies Batman: Mask of the Phantasm uses a lot of the same plot elements as Casablanca. Saying this I love the use of flashbacks to show important parts of the film. I also just love the styling of 40's everyone just is dressed as fancy as they could just a great moment in America's history. The film also has a great love story which is such a relief to see because most films love stories are just way to sappy or overdone, I feel it was just perfect to fit the mood of the film and the moments that were happening of the world. How Rick was a symbol of America during the start of World War II he did not want to get involved in any other's business (Europe) but towards the end of the film he has no choice to, make sure Ilsa is safe and gets on the plane (Pearl Harbor).",

275,12 March 2011,spdowling,10, The best film I have ever seen,"There is nothing I can say about Michael Curtiz's masterwork Casablanca(1942)that hasn't already been said by thousands, perhaps millions, of cinema lovers over the past 70 years. There aren't enough superlatives in the dictionary to describe just how perfectly the story, the characters, the images, the music, the sounds and all elements of the film's production are presented. The thing that sets Casablanca apart from the other films universally considered as being among the greatest of all time including Citizen Kane(1941) and The Godfather Part I(1972)and Part II(1974), among others, is the comedy of the piece. To balance the heart wrenching and soul shattering effects of war, occupation, fascism, betrayal and lost love with so much high quality comedy and so many great jokes is just stunning. Importantly, the comic elements disarm the audience without distracting from the life and death tension of the surroundings of the film. The emotions of the piece all feel very real and genuine and the audience is allowed into the lives of these characters in a way that very few films allow. Bogart's Rick is just about the coolest guy in the history of the world and Bergman's Ilsa it just about the most beautiful and charming woman in the history of the world. Claude Rains contributes a masterfully enigmatic performance as the police Captain Louis Renault and the entire cast of characters makes the place and the era come bursting to life. Curtiz's use of light and shadows sets the perfect tone for this perfect film and all elements of production are perfectly on point. I can't say for certain that Casablanca is the greatest film that has ever been made as I haven't seen them all but there's a pretty damn good chance that it is.",

When it was made - late 41 early 42 (it was released in late nov 42) - World War two was by no means decided so this film also serves as a morale booster as the seemingly uncaring Bogie for love of a woman finds a conscience and helps win the freedom of a country. The metaphors are present if one looks: Bogie being US Bergman and husband being the allies..and of course the Nazi being the Nazi. Casablanca, translated from french, White House.

In 1982, Chuck Ross submitted the screenplay of Casablanca under a different name to 217 agencies as an experiment to see whether they would pick up on it. There were a range of reactions. Some agencies recognised it, but many rejected the screenplay with negative feedback. They said the dialogue was unconvincing, it dragged on, the story was dull and so on. The whole experiment was supposed to be an exposé of the industry itself - clueless agents who would never recognise a famous Academy-award-winning screenplay for what it is. However, in my opinion, the naysayers were actually right. The film isn't terrible, but it does have the alleged flaws - it is dull, unconvincing, hokey, slow and trite. I don't see the appeal for others. Nothing blew me away, the character drama didn't inspire me and I don't feel the need to quote it weeks from now.

What I liked most about it was what it wasn't. Unlike most war movies that I've seen that were actually made during World War II, this has no battle scenes and no overtly patriotic binges (and what patriotism there is is French rather than American, which I found refreshing.)

What stood out the most to me was the use of music in this film. Sams voice of course was a highlight for me, his performances set this film above others in this time. Especially the use of the song ""as time goes by"" the song is so prominent in the film and there are so many different emotions that accompany it throughout the film. The song showed the evolution of Sam and Ilsa's relationship, there were the moments were the song was filled with anger and what was lost and the moments of them in love and finding each other again. With the movie being so fast pace there are a lot of moments that can be missed or misunderstood but the feelings the actors portrayed when ""as time goes by"" played made the feelings in those moments easy to comprehend. Also Rick of course was a stand out character and evolved greatly throughout the film. Rick was one person to Ilsa and one person to everyone else who knew him at the Cafe. After Rick lost Ilsa he became selfish and full of anger, but as the film went on he stripped away his hard exterior and ultimately gave up everything he ever wanted so Ilsa could have the life he knew she deserved. Ricks selflessness at the end of the film showed just how strong his love for Ilsa was, he chose her happiness over his.",

297,31 July 2013,Phillip-Riback,10, Words are Sufficient,"""This is a beginning of a beautiful friendship"" – that is how this unforgettable and everlasting movie, which talks about love, friendship, loyalty, intrigue, and survival ends. The play takes place in the city of Casablanca, and even though we are unable to see the city (because the action takes place mainly in Ricks' bar), the life of the city is present. On one side are refugees waiting to escape from the horrors of war, and on the other are those who still enjoy nights full of gambling and entertainment, or smuggling and enrichment. The love story is started in war Paris, and revived through the memories in the currently more peaceful Morocco. The fact that love is stronger and larger than any other living thing, and subordinate to world events, is show in the decisions Rick (H. Bogart) makes. Although the movie is black-and-white, it even more emphasizes time events. There is also a color version of the film, but it feels like something is missing. If you have a chance to watch it, you shouldn't miss this masterpiece. And if you have watched it... Play It Again Sam.",

The story, of love found and lost and then found again, of choosing principle over expediency, of deciding what really matters, is timeless. The performances are top notch, aided by the fact that many of the actors were actual refugees from the Nazis. I think of the look of hatred and pain on Rick's face when he sees Ilsa again for the first time, of his look of loss at the train station, of his look of nobility when he tells her that the ""good fight"" is worth what they have to give up as he says ""here's looking at you, kid"". A bittersweet romantic outcome for the ages. I think of how luminous Ingrid looks, and how expressive her eyes are as she experiences love, pain, sorrow, joy, and regret. One of the greatest scripts ever written. It amazes me that the script was essentially written on the fly, and they didn't even decide until late how it would all turn out.

It is a wonderful melodrama that keeps you hooked and although it is not in my top ten films it is a great film. The plot is wonderful and always makes perfect sense. It is a little melodramatic yes but how could they keep our attention with something more like real life. The screenplay is just as amazing with flawless and quotable dialogue and amazing twists and characters. The performances are the best part of the movie. Humphrey Bogart gives one of his best performances and is amazing but it is Ingrid Bergman who is the standout. She gives one of the best performances in movie history. The direction was also flawless and deserved the Oscar for sure. The visual effects are very good but not as flawless as the rest of the movie. They sometimes look fake but always work fine the way they are. Casablanca is a classic that should be seen by everyone. Particularly teenagers. That may sound weird but its true.

Lines like ""Here's looking at you, kid"", or ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"", have entered American culture and become part of the language. The reason the film is so popular, even among modern audiences, is because of how personal the subject matter was to audiences - and the cast, too - at the time the film was released. It truly is a film for everyone. The cast features Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the leading roles, and is supported by an array of incredible character actors including Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, Paul Henreid, and Dooley Wilson. These actors don't just put on a spectacle for the viewer to watch; they create an organic, multi-faceted, and culturally diverse community. Rick's nightclub is home to this community where secrets are kept hidden – or discovered – and people are forced to decide where there loyalties lie. ""Casablanca"" deserves a point all its own on the timeline of American film history. It's romance and it's drama; it is an uplifting comedy and a geopolitical thriller.

The only thing I could tell you about it was that Humphrey Bogart was in it and there was a scene on a foggy airfield somewhere. Other than that I just thought it was some good classic film that simply got over hyped like so many others. Within 30 minutes of the movie I could clearly see I was mistaken. The story, acting, and sets were all fantastic but what really won me over was the amazing cinematography work by Arthur Edeson. Especially the scenes shot in ""Rick's Café Américain"". The use of lighting and shadows was fantastic and gave this film a sort of film noir precursor feel. This film knows exactly when to let information go at exactly the right time and when to add a little comic relief when things start to get tense; whither it be the delight wit and charm of Bogart or the antics of Szőke Szakáll. ""Casablanca""(1942) will keep you guessing with whats going to happen with the characters facing many moral dilemmas and you not knowing if their going to take the high or low road.

The set design is seemingly flawless, as is the acting, particularly the performances delivered by leads Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. Above all else, I think the writing made Casablanca the classic film that it is. There are countless quotable lines, and the film (and specific scenes) has been parodied into oblivion. The editing in Casablanca continues to contribute to the film's soundness. Various techniques employed severely impact the quality of the storytelling, particularly the film's famous flashback.

The film seamlessly combines romance and intrigue in its exotic location, remarkably conveyed by mere studio sets.

Despite seeming a product of its time, ""Casablanca"" is truly a timeless piece of entertainment. It would be futile to recount the plot here. Even those who have never seen the film are likely to be aware that ""Casablanca"" is the film where Ingrid Bergman is forced to chose between old lover Humphrey Bogart and her resistance leader husband (the often overlooked Paul Henreid). Bergman as Ilsa Lund, the center of the love triangle, is magnificent here. She communicates with such ease the very different types of love she feels for each man in her life, and we sympathize with her struggle. Of course, Bogart too created a legendary performance as café owner Rick Blaine.

There isn't enough I could say about this movie and the internet has done its best to say just about everything. Beautiful story, beautiful acting, beautiful cinematography, and a beautiful song. Humphrey Bogarts performance as Rick Blaine instantly made him one of my favorite characters across all cinema. Rick is the definition of ""Cool"" in Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman simply delivers in the role of Ilsa Lund. Passionate and elegant, she crafted a great character. I enjoyed the part of Captain Louis, played by Claude Rains, a sophisticated yet subtly amusing character. Rains is fantastic, as time goes by I watch myself becoming a bigger and bigger fan of his. Speaking of ""As Time Goes By"", this song captures the feel and emotion of Casablanca, not only the loss of a true love the loss of security. Casablanca allows the audience to feel the passion, heartbreak, paranoia, and pressure of war and its consequences. If you are a history buff you will appreciate the historical ramifications of Casablanca and the glimpse of the indirect impacts of WWII outside of Europe.

The year was 1942 like I already said, so of course World War II was a huge issue and this was a truly contemporarily relevant movie. Maybe this is why many mistook it for a great movie. It is not bad by any definition, but it is also certainly not the classic many people say it is. The subject here is also fairly unusual for a war movie and I cannot really remember any other film that focused primarily on the issue of people getting visas in order to be able to leave Europe/Africa and get to the United States where war hadn't arrived yet. Maybe this uniqueness in terms of subject is another reason why many people like it. We don't get military action or Holocaust stories (obviously because the entire mess was not known at that point yet) here, but something else. As for the cast: The lead actor here was Humphrey Bogart. He was okay overall, but not good enough for an Oscar nomination I'd say. I am glad Ingrid Bergman did not get any because she really was mostly forgettable here and honestly her scenes with Bogart were not the best the film had to offer, but maybe the worst, so it is really bizarre how some talk about this being the biggest romance story ever. If it really was this big, she would not have left him behind (twice!) and he would not agree that it is the right thing to do towards the end. The only solid moment there was when he said that now they have Paris again because he knows her real motivation for letting him go. Actually, I like the idea of this motivation in the sense of a greater cause, even if it is of course debatable if it makes sense that the two split up although they have major feelings for each other, which clearly she does not have for the Hungarian fella. There were at least two occasions when he says he loves her, but she does not say the same back. As for the cast, the second Oscar nomination went to Claude Rains, one of the most influential supporting actors of his time. He was okay too I'd say, but again not good enough for an Oscar nomination. I guess many mistook his surprising twist at the end (when he helps Bogart's character after seeming more like an antagonist all the way before that) for a great performance. But surprising does not equal sublime. His nomination was probably more about the writing than really about the portrayal. And of course that he was a good guy eventually. I must also say something about him becoming good did not make sense entirely. I can see why he was not too angry at Bogart's character for the fact that he let him not have the Bulgarian girl (by the way how did he even know the roulette numbers?), but he says earlier that they have not decided yet if a prisoner committed suicide or was killed while trying to flee (implying murder), which shows that he is definitely one of the bad guys, even if he is not German. The one who is German here is actor Conrad Veidt and his character was pretty much the main antagonist, even if he did not have too much screen time. Really sad how Veidt died shortly after this film was made at a relatively young age. He could have head a great career in Hollywood ahead of him. I think he was sublimely talented. Another (somewhat) German actor here was Peter Lorre. Many people immediately think of ""M"" when they hear his name, but they do not remember he was in here too and he plays a victim once again. I think his character is a Spaniard? With the black hair it kinda works. Luckily he lives on for a while afterwards. The supporting players are all pretty good here, for example also Sydney Greenstreet, who was nominated for an Oscar too the year this came out, so a fairly impressive cast for sure. It surprises me that Rains is the one we are supposed to believe stood out.",

My favorite scene is the singing of La Marseilles; remember, this is a movie about passion and good and evil, altho the ending and many other scenes are also great.  I also find it interesting that this was a play before, and many did not think it as effective as a play, but it worked so well as a movie.  The backdrop and the skills of film makers can add a lot (and the acting).  But although Ingrid Bergman fit in well here, I thought that the acting jobs by Bogart and others, purely in terms of being convincing, were better.  Excellent scenery, elegant French culture, so well scripted, and idealistic.  Yet altho Rick changed at the end, his person throughout the bulk of the movie allows a good outlet for people feeling life's frustrations.

Bogart gives the performance of a lifetime as Richard Blaine. There's a real sense of bitterness and dismay that no other actor could come close to capturing. Ingrid Bergman becomes one of the most beautiful creatures to ever grace the screen as the breathtaking Ilsa Lund. you can really see her heart breaking throughout the movie in the way her eyes move as she tries to pick between her husband, Victor Lazlo (Paul Henreid who gives a great performance as the well respected war hero), and her former lover, who now has become a crotchety old drunk.

365,29 September 2000,Tresix,10, THE Standard,"I can honestly say I know what makes a good movie because I have a standard by which to compare it:  CASABLANCA.  Adapted from a play entitled ""Everyone Comes to Rick's"", CASABLANCA tells the story of American Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart in the role that made his legend), a cynical saloon owner. His motto:  ""I stick my neck out for nobody.  I'M the only cause worth fighting for.""  We learn that, in the past, Rick was once an idealistic man who would fight the good fight for just causes.  As his ""friend"" Louie (Claude Rains) reminds him as he ticks off the underdog causes that Rick has championed ""The winning side would have paid MUCH more.""  Just when we are convinced that Rick truly is an insular hard-case . . . into his life returns Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), the woman who killed the idealism in him.  She is on the arm of freedom fighter Victor Laslo (Paul Heinreid). The sight of Ilsa sparks a flashback that shows Rick, Ilsa and Rick's piano-playing friend Sam (Dooley Wilson) in Paris before the arrival of the Nazis.  As Rick and Sam wait for Ilsa, she sends him a note at the train station saying that she can never see him again.  That is, until their paths cross again in Casablanca.  To add to the stress, the Nazis, led by the pinch-faced Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), decide to march into Casablanca as well.  Their intent:  To capture Laslo and prevent him from stirring up strength against the Nazis on the other side of the world. CASABLANCA benefits greatly from a dynamite script, great directing and, for once, the perfect union of casting and character.  By now, most people know how the film ends.  This is even more impressive since the ending to the film was being written even as the cameras began rolling to shoot it.  Two endings had been written, but when the producers saw the ending that was shot (the one used in the film), they saw no need to shoot the other ending.  Needless to say, CASABLANCA is a part of my film library. If it's not in your's, you're only depriving yourself.",

Everyone has a sob story to tell (except for the Nazis who have given people the material for their own sob stories), but the movie would sink into the most depressing experience possible if the script didn't cut off the sob stories before people started to show self-pity. The only self-pitying character is Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) -- who doesn't realize how lucky he is to be an American. ",
368,8 November 2003,David_Hart,10, The best hollywood movie of all-time,"When people ask me what is the best movie of all-time is I don't flinch, I just say ""Casablanca"". It has everything a great movie should have: romance, sacrifice, wonderful lines, a memorable song, incredible acting (even in the smallest roles) and it is one of the few non-film noir movies filmed in the B&W era that I wouldn't want to see refilmed in color (that is in definite contrast to ""I Know Where I'm Going!"" which begs to be refilmed to show the beauty of its vistas). But the key that makes everything works is the ending. I don't think the ending that exists in Casablanca could be filmed today and though most have seen this movie (or any of its parodies) I don't want to give anything away. But I encourage you to compare the ending of this movie with the endings of other romantic movies such as ""An Affair to Remember"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and even the most recent animated ""Sinbad"" movie.

369,14 January 2015,JosephPezzuto,8, Reel Look: 'Casablacna',"""Here's looking at you, kid."" The year 1940 signaled a final turning point for isolationism. German military successes in Europe prompted nationwide American rethinking about its posture toward the war. Even if America did manage to repel invasions, its way of life might wither if it were forced to become a garrison state. Isolationism now became involvement, as thousands of brave soldiers battled their way through many historical battles and a fight for ultimate freedom. Franklin Roosevelt convinced a largely isolationist Congress to pass the Land-Lease Act, allowing the U.S. to sell or lend war materials to ""any country whose defense the President deems vital to the defense of the United States."" A true war was occurring, and the American people would never dream of succumbing to the Nazi way. However, it seemed that people across the world were all in a whirlwind of discomfort and desperation to survive. These changes, also portrayed by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), truly captivates what terror has been wrought upon the souls of Europe, and how anxious people captivated by dread and by just living one more day was a miracle in and of itself. But how did this whole outbreak of escaping and massacre soften Rick to a point where he finally did stick his neck out to a desperate couple in breaking free from the world in which he knew that ultimately became a matter of life and death? Let's take a look.",

From start to finish, the dialogue is endlessly quotable without becoming obnoxious, and it maintains a keen wit that is unforgettably punched into film canon with Humphrey Bogart's legendary delivery. Bergman is angelically filmed in each scene with extreme attention paid to framing and lighting, and she flawlessly portrays a woman tortured by her situation. The special attention to the lighting, the bustling Rick's café, the unique period of American neutrality before involvement in WWII... The list of things I love about this movie goes on and on.

Casablanca is just one of the classic old movies-especially one with a consistently enjoyable story. Of course, the film runs a little slow at times, but then picks up more as the film goes on. Therefore, the viewer feels more engaged into the storyline and conflict of the film.

374,2 May 2013,bigcahs93,9, An American staple that stands as a timeless classic,"Casablanca is a 1942 romantic drama directed by Michael Curtiz, staring Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund. In the realm of American films, Casablanca is as well regarded as Gandhi or Einstein, and for good reason. You can make the argument about the films political messages regarding the time period, but nothing overall hinders the movie, in my opinion. Like most other movies of the time, the cinematography is excellent, not very exciting but well made none the less. Curtiz also uses dark lighting in an excellent way, in fact one could make the argument that this film is total film noir because of Curtiz's obsession with shadows. Otherwise, in terms of content, nothing else about the movie really stands out, with maybe the exception of the mini airfield they made for the movie. What keeps Casablanca as a hallmark in our collective movie going memory is the love story. With the exception of the part where Rick just casually asks Ilsa if she wanted to get married, a truly boss move on Bogart's part, the love story feels very natural, and realistic. Even a violence craving, Scorsese/Tarantino loving person like myself can't help but feel the plight of Rick and Ilsa, two humans in an extreme rut. 9/10",

'Casablanca (1942)' is a cynical but well-drawn piece with a gruff lead who's callously charismatic and charming in that straight-talking kind of way.

I thought that the two main characters were perfectly fit for this movie. The protagonist, Rick has certain suave air to himself, which allows the audience to like him at first sight. His attitude shows neutrality with a hint of passion at the same time. Ilsa, the love interest, makes one see a different side to Rick. I would have to say the police captain was my favorite character due to the fact that he brought comic relief while staying in the realm of being serious.

Peter Lorre as a pathetic loser, Sidney Greenstreet is still ""The Fat Man"" and Bogey is still the hard boiled realist.  The difference to the MF is that instead of a Dashiel Hammet derivative detective story, this one is based on themes from what was the classic story of the early years of Nazi history - the transit visa.  That was the holy grail that meant survival to millions who fled between 1932 and when the borders closed shortly after the fall of Paris.  From this perspective, Ricks actions can be seen not so much as noble self denial but the hard reality that in such times the problems of two lovers ""don't amount to a hill of beans.""",

Casablanca starts out with the death of two Germans carrying exit visas, the key for someone in Casablanca to go to Lisbon then the Americas. We then enter Rick's Cafe American, where most of the story takes place. Ugate(Lorre)told Rick(Bogart) about the two exit visas that were stolen and needed Rick to hold them for a few hours. Capt.

Rick doesn't care until he meets and finds out that Laszlo's wife was Ilsa Lund, his lover in France that left him. Now, he must choose between his feelings, or the countless lives that hang in the balance. Casablanca carries such great performances such as Sydney Greenstreet, Dooley Wilson, Conrad Veidt, and many more.

I lost count of the number of frivolously double-edged and charmingly barbed lines delivered by Rains' Capt. Renault, to whom everyone is a target at the beginning of the movie, almost as if he were unsure of exactly whose side he was on, which is most likely the case as the script was constantly being re-doctored and changed during filming.

The composition of the film is really what I enjoyed, everything is crafted so beautifully. The plot is great but just not for me I guess and if it wasn't for each scene being so artistically graceful I would have definitely lost concentration on the story.

I was expecting a whirlwind romance between characters brought together by adversity and one character making a sacrifice for them to stay together. But no. While the romance and sacrifice elements were present, the premises and outcome are totally different. In the early years of WWII, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) runs a very successful restaurant-cum-bar in Casablanca, neutral French territory where Europeans pay a fortune for exit papers to get to America. One day, his former lover Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) appears, with her husband political activist Victor Laszlo. Rick and Ilsa had a whirlwind romance some years back in Paris but she disappeared on the day they were supposed to depart together, leaving only a note of apology and a devastated Rick. Ilsa is determined to help her husband escape from the Nazis, but decides to stay behind with Rick. Although it comes at some cost to himself, Rick does what he feels is best for her, in the spirit of true love.",

The story is sharp, the writing is crisp and the delivery from the whole cast, in particularly Humphrey Bogart is flawless. From location, to music, to just the overall incredibly coolness that the movie just exudes, Casablanca is a timeless classic that will still be perfect hundreds of years from now. It has awesome iconic characters, stellar acting from Bogart and Rains, while Ingrid Bergman is simply stunning and incredibly graceful in her delivery.

You can't help but love this picture! You become mesmerized by the actors and the scenes they play. The story is interesting and the film in my opinion is flawless. After watching this picture your faith in humanity is once again restored. These people are the real superheroes, not the cartoon characters worshiped in today's films. 
Rick Blaine and Victor Lazlo where no Redford or Newman when it came to looks, but damn if they weren't sexier! Who knew after watching Bogie in so many 30's gangster flicks that he would be the epitome of love and romance in the 40's. And how can you not help but love and feel empathy for Ingrid Bergman as we watch her struggle with the love she feels for Rick and the pride and loyalty she feels for Victor? As always, Claude Rains, Perez Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z. Sakall, Conrad Veidt, Dooley Wilson, Leonid Kinskey and the remaining supporting cast are remarkable. 
If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor, grab a box of Kleenex, round up the usual suspects and watch this film. You won't be sorry.

It concerns an elusive cynical American nightclub owner named Rick Blaine, played magnificently by Humphrey Bogart in an iconic Oscar nominated performance for Best Actor, Rick finds his old flame IIsa Lund, played brilliantly by the luminous Ingrid Bergman, walking into his nightclub one night with her husband, Victor Laszio, impressively played by Paul Henreid, who is the underground resistance leader from Czechoslovaki. At the same time the Nazi Major Strasser, superbly played by Conrad Veidt, arrives in Casablanca and is determine to arrest Laszio with the help of the dapper and corrupt Captain Louis Renault, played marvelously by the scene-stealing Claude Rains who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his memorable performance. Rick is in possession of some letters of transit that could help Laszio and IIsa escape to freedom in America, but will Rick help them or keep the letters for himself and finally leave Casablanca, well there in lies the tale. Flawless Oscar winning direction by Curtiz, with exceptional supporting performances by Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Dooley Wilson, S. Z. Sakall, Madeleine Lebeau, Joy Page, and John Qualen.

It also has many plot lines, which is no mistake to the directors, because for some of them, it answers them as soon as you see them, it answers them in the middle, it leaves it for the end, or cliff hangs you on with not a single intention for a sequel. Besides, a sequel will destroy it's premise. While many actors are excellent in the supporting cast, Humphrey Bogart is spectacular as the selfish, money loving, one-woman, man, but gets his heart at the end. It's shocking that he didn't win the Oscar, (well he was nominated.) And this film never gets too predictable, when you pause, you still look at the single frame, looking for clues.

According to the film's makers, Casablanca was one of those amazing unexpected successes that fate occasionally surprises us with. Apparently no one involved in making this movie expected it to be the famous classic it became. Reportedly, some of the actors and film makers nearly turned it down because the script just seemed like another unremarkable war movie.

Consider the fact that Bogart's character Rick represents the social and military isolationism of the US prior to the war and how he changes to making sacrifices for the good of the cause.  ""The lives of 2 human beings don't add up to a hill of beans"" so he gives her up for the greater good. That's Hollywood telling us that we need to sacrifice in our personal lives in order to fight for the greater good.

448,15 June 1999,Muldrake-2,10, On my very short list of must sees,"Casablanca has every right to be considered amongst the best ever made because of its timelessness. As noted in another comment, Casablanca remains as complex, funny, romantic, and full of suspense as it did when it first graced the silver screen nearly 60 years ago. I recommend it often, and rarely do my friends not thoroughly enjoy the film, despite the fact that most of my friends and I were not born until 35 years after it was written. Those few that didn't like it simply don't like anything in black and white, which is their loss I suppose (the colorized version, to be frank, sucks).

Of course the movie is dependent on circumstances under which it was made and nobody would believe that things would really happen exactly like that, but the heck with it - it can easily be forgiven. And regarding the fact it was filmed in 40's when the war was far from being finished, the propagandistic aspect of the movie could have been far worse.

Even the flash back sequences which I remember on first viewing I thought of as naff and on the twee side I now realise fit perfectly into the notion of carefree love between the main protagonists and subsequently explain their feelings in later encounters.Elements such as the costumes for both men and women are outstanding and all photograph beautifully in B&W ,especially that little number Ilsa is wearing during her chat with Nick in the market place.All the actors , even the most minor of minor characters have been superb and after countless viewings I still get the afterglow of Nick's natural goodness when he saves the young Bulgarian lass from the clutches of the police chief by letting her win at roulette and so enabling her to pay for her exit visa. Although this film is set in a specific time and place it has not really dated.There will always be times when the whole world goes mad and danger is at hand.People need help.People need love.

453,29 September 2012,jose-cruz53,5, I found it mediocre,"Set in the early 1940′s, when WW2 was ranging and the outcome of the conflict was still far from clear. Casablanca is the name of a town in the coast of North Africa that was a focal point in gathering people from all the countries involved in the war, from refugees from occupied France to Americans seeking to make out a living out of this growing consumer market generated by this focal point. The main character is an American that owns the most popular bar in the town, where ""the action happens"".",
454,26 December 2008,Cosmoeticadotcom,6," Good, not great","First, let's go with the performances of some of the leading characters, and let me start by stating that most of the characterizations of the acting abilities of the actors in this film, by critics, are often quite wrongheaded. Let us start with the three top billed actors, Humphrey Bogart as club owner Rick Blaine, Ingrid Bergman as his ex-lover Ilsa Lund, and Paul Henreid as Ilsa's husband, the Czechoslovakian Nazi Resistance outlaw, Victor Laszlo. Virtually all critiques of this trio leave Henreid as the odd man out, mainly because the film focuses on the love angle between Rick and Ilsa. But, from a purely technical standpoint, Henreid gives, by far, the best acting performance of the trio (and, it's not even close). Because it is the most restrained and understated, however, it usually gets dismissed as stiff acting, rather than good acting of an intentionally stiff character....one need only look at the cheesy scene in the bar, where Victor hears the Nazis singing their song, Die Wacht Am Rhein, and dares to get the band to play La Marseillaise, then look in Victor's eyes, to see that, far from what critics claim, Victor is a man of great passion and principles from the get go, and this break from his usual restraint gains in power precisely because it is a break, but one that seems wholly natural for a man who has been frustrated for the bulk of his scenes in the film, and then feels he is having his face rubbed in it. While the political implications of the scene have lost their resonance (as do most blatantly political gestures in art), Henreid's volcanically restrained performance in that scene has not. And, as an asides, compare that scene with a similar scene toward the ends of the aforementioned Paths Of Glory, where a captured German girl is put on stage, in front of drunken French soldiers seemingly willing to ravage her, until she starts singing a plaintive German tune of a soldier and his lost love. The drunk soldiers quiet down, and eventually start humming along with the 'enemy,' and slowly show that they have not been totally inured by carnage. A comparison of these two scenes (their structure and placement) neatly and clearly shows why Casablanca is mere entertainment, while Paths Of Glory is great art. Simply stated, without the character (in his physical being and internal composition) of Victor Laszlo, Casablanca does not even reach being a good prose melodrama.",

I THOUGHT I knew the story. I didn't.

456,7 April 2005,RNMorton,10, Hollywood's Greatest,"As Leonard Maltin says, ""everything's right"" in this movie about Vichy-occupied Casablanca in World War II. Bogie is the ambiguously ex-patriot proprietor of Rick's Cafe with Wilson as his loyal sidekick; Rains is the amoral (or is he?) local constabulary; Greenstreet is the owner of a neighboring saloon; Lorre does a stretch as a conniving weasel. Then Bogart's old flame Ingrid blows into town with resistance leader Henreid in tow and everything goes upside down. Almost every line is a gem, whether it bristles (most of them) or is so overdone as to be awesomely camp. The only arguably slow part (and it suffers only in comparison) is the extended Paris flashback. I think this is Bogart's signature performance, a notch or two above his (or pretty much anyone else's) best work. Bergman is breathtaking as his old girlfriend; and all the supporting characters shine in their own way, particularly Rains, who may actually have as many memorable lines as Bogart.

Watch the film again and you can't help but wonder if this isn't the best love story duo ever. Every scene together is so heartwarming and tender it grabs your emotions and doesn't let go.

From the beginning scene in which Ugarte tells Rick that he has the transit papers I was on the edge of my seat. The scene in which Rick allows the French to sing their national anthem while the German soldiers are singing theirs is one of absolute triumph.

Then she wanted to go to America with Rick, but Rick makes her stay with her husband. For the story of the movie I believe this works. I don't believe, however, it's realistic in real life. ",
472,17 December 2010,cinema_student2010,8, People Are Right,"I've heard Casablanca talked about as a classic for years, but hadn't gotten the opportunity to see it until now. Boy am I glad I did! Although I'm not one of those people that feels Casablanca is the best film ever made, it is enjoyable. The quality I liked most about this film was its ability to suck me in, although I must admit there where parts where I got lost a little bit.There's a lot going on this movie, World War 2, the running of his club, double crossing, and of course you cant forget the ultimate love story. for being a movie thats older, well not from my generation,i didn't find the dialog to be overly cheesy.The ending of this movie is pretty awesome.I like that you think you know whats going to happen but you don't, (at the airport situation, who gets blame etc).There's also some great cinematography in Casablanca. The use of lighting to set up shots for the camera is magnificent. They also tend to focus on a searchlight in the movie as well.The actors in Casablanca are just magnificent, they really add a certain well, realistic element, for lack of a better term. Humphrey Bogart is enjoyable as usual. I've only seen a few of his films, but this is my favorite by far. He does such a good job of keeping his character in line, invulnerable and cold at times, but heartfelt at others. now i can really understand the line ""of all the jin joints in all the world.""",
473,9 September 2021,daisukereds,6," A lucky classic - ""When Corn works..""","Personally, aside from the beautiful Ingrid Bergman, not much left an impression. As Romance is a tad bland, and as a Political movie it's a bit dull. If it wasn't because of Claude Rains (as Captain Louis Renault), it would have fallen flat for me. I could elaborate, but it is completely subjective. Still, I can certainly see why, with the interesting structure and progress from a 40s script, it would be so memorable even with today's standards. And I did enjoy the relayed experience and information of a situation from so long ago. The lightning during the entire movie is probably the single best thing about it, specially for a black and white movie. The pacing is also impressive, which makes it watchable still today.",

I'm 33-years-old and had never really been one to go back and watch old black-and-white movies. The first movie I ever really remember going to see at the theater was Raiders of the Lost Ark. I was in love with the movies from then on. Oh, sure, I'd gone to the drive-in in rural Alabama and had seen various movies. But I had been too young and immature to really appreciate them for what they were. But when my uncle took me to see Raiders, I was hooked. For years, I considered Spielberg's masterpiece to be the best movie ever made. But then I happened to get hold of a VHS copy of Casablanca and checked it out. WOW! Moviemaking had been redefined for me. This movie has it all. Bogart is such an incredible presence. I think Harrison Ford is our modern-day answer to Bogart. The story is so straight-forward and so cool ... the backstory about the romance in Paris is great, perfectly handled. The one-liners are unforgettable, and the songs are enchanting. This is the whole package, alright. Perfect movie.",

478,5 March 2015,Patti-Gaston,10, Timeless classic,"Truly one of the most remarkable films ever made; from the witty dialogue to the stunning photography to the beautiful acting, I cannot praise this movie too much. Almost immediately you enter into a visual spectacle from the beautiful reflections on the walls of the Cafe Americain to beautiful women dressed in sparkly costumes to Rick in his perfectly pressed, white dinner jacket we enter a world of sophistication and beauty. We quickly learn however that there are real troubles just beneath the surface. Immediately we learn that 2 German couriers have been murdered. The police suspect the murderer is at Rick's café but before the police arrest the suspect he asks Rick to hold the transport papers he stole from the Germans which are the keys to freedom from the German controlled, but unoccupied French Moroccan city of Casablanca. Rick is suave, sophisticated and clever until Ilsa walks in,the woman who broke his heart. We learn that the two had a love affair in Paris and as they were about to leave Paris together right before the German occupation Ilsa did not meet Rick at the train station when she was supposed to. She sent a note along with Sam that said she was not coming. Needless to say Rick was bitter when she shows up in his Cafe but over time he does find out why Ilsa left him. He is also inspired on how to use the transport papers. While the overall focus of the movie is the love story between Rick and Ilsa and the sacrifices made for love, the Nazi threat is made all to real. The release of the movie 6 months after the United States' involvement in WWII, shined a light on how terrifying it must have been for people trying to escape. I think everyone should watch this movie again and again to remind us all that even in the absolutely worst of times love can conquer anything.",

Virtually every scene is a classic, especially the scenes where Bogart allows Henreid to drown out the Nazis with the French anthem, and the last scene. Dooley Wilson as Sam is Bogart's conscience, sort of like Jiminy Cricket. Claude Rains is wonderful as usual. He should have won at least 10 Supporting Actor Oscars, but especially here, as the collaborator who becomes a patriot. Likewise, Madeline LeBeau is great in a small role as the girl spurned by Bogart, then she dallies with the Nazis, but when Henried leads the Marseillese, she remembers what it means to be French.",

But if I'm being completely honest I believe that it was a bit over sold, not to say that I didn't enjoy the movie; I really did enjoy it. I found the plot of the movie to be very engaging and not too hard to follow and the acting was absolutely amazing. I thought there was so much to take in, which I really enjoyed and there many round characters that had great character development. I really enjoyed the character of Rick and how he progressed throughout the movie. I also very much so loved all of the quick witted humor that filled the movie and you either got it or you didn't, it wasn't highlighted at all. And besides the writing and the performances of the cast I really loved the lighting used throughout the movie and thought that it helped to amplify the story significantly.

Set in Morocco, this film has a beautiful sense of composition and lighting, setting the stage for films to come. The characters are rich, and while not all of them are complex they are still a treat and do not feel trope-y.

488,14 November 2010,alexv1208,9, Review of Casablanca,"Casablanca is a persuasive pro-American film. It's fictional yet accurately portrays events that took place during world War II. The film has a large political influence, even Rick's character represents America's isolation from the war. The film is beautifully written and shot. Music plays a huge part in the film. It emphasizes the setting and feel of the film. As the mood of the characters change, so does the music. Even when the French sing their national anthem this adds so much to the film, and it becomes even more clear how passionate the French are about their country. The accents of the actors add to the mise-en scene, as well as the lighting in many of the scenes, such as the lighting in the restaurant, when everything is dim, the candles on the table are the only form of light, creating a certain mood. The movie is very fast paced, you can't look away for a moment or get out of your chair for a snack. There's always some new twist. Casablanca is a thrilling film to watch, and one that really lives up to it's expectations.",

While I usually feel that directors are responsible for the greatness of films, not actors, this is certainly a case to test that rule. The more than capable cast give, almost to a one, riveting performances; consider how, in a very few minutes of screen time, Peter Lorre, or Sydney Greenstreet, capture not only our attention, but the essence of the shady, disreputable characters they play. There is an ocean of sublime performance in Lorre's deliver of the ""You despise me, don't you?"" line; hams like Costner, Cruise and die Caprio should be forced to watch him over and over, until they get it right.",

But that was about it.  I saw it again when I was 19 years old and this time it blew me away.  The performances, the writing, the cinematography, the direction, and the music all seemed perfect.  I watched one more time a little later to confirm that this might be one of the best films ever, and I liked it even more.  I can't necessarily give specifics, but maybe it's the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman, or maybe it's the outstanding supporting cast.

Just an all around great movie, and even for the few of those who can't agree that Casablanca is the all-around greatest movie of all time, they perhaps would at least agree that it has all the elements and plenty enough of what it takes to be putting up an honorable fight to claim that top spot, and most definitely should be on any critic's short list of greatest movies, if they expect to really be taken seriously. .",

Of course the story, plot, and characters are also very well done, but in my opinion it is the presentation of everything that really grabs your attention. i'm sure this film was substantially more powerful at the time it was released during the war, but today one can still feel the struggles of the time period in this movie. i really enjoyed all the humor that is tucked in to such a serious subject it takes the edge off.",

500,6 December 2004,mnjanco,10, The Best Movie Ever Made,"It's hard not to repeat others when commenting on the movie that many people consider to be the best of all times. The Film Institute ranks it number two behind Citizen Kane. I like Citizen Kane very much, but I do not think it is anywhere near as good as Casablanca. It is simply the finest blend of script, sets, characters, casting, music and photography that Hollywood has ever produced. Who can forget the shadow of the dancing woman on the wall? Has there ever been a funnier straight man than Claude Raines? Or an oilier villain than Peter Lorre? The scene where Paul Heinried leads the audience in the Marseillaise is rightfully one of the most touching in the history of the cinema. But what impressed me is how the French National Anthem blended with the German song the Nazis were singing, so well that it sounded like a round. As much as I liked the movie itself, I never appreciated it as much until I bought the VHS version showing the making of the movie. How many viewers realize that the writers didn't know which of the lead characters Ilse would go off with until literally the end of the movie? How many know that three different directors worked on various parts of the movie? Or that it was one of the most brilliant success stories of a movie put together by committee? Not too many years ago, the favorite trivia ""factoid"" was that Bogart never said ""Play it again, Sam."" He actually said, ""Play it, Sam."" I still get misty-eyed every time I hear As Time Goes By. It's very unusual that I remember the theme from a modern movie by the time I leave the theatre. Only the Ring Trilogy has come close to matching Casablanca in so many different ways. But who wants to watch something for ten hours when you can get the same effect in an hour and a half?",

I was divorced from my ex-wife for about a year. My youngest step-son, Kyle, was 11 at the time. He's was, and still is, a huge movie fan. He loves the classics, even at that young of an age. He was over for a weekend visit and he suggested that we go downtown to see Casablanca. I agreed and off we went. I can honestly say that night changed my life.

One: it's a love story and a man who only wants to do what's best for him but later has a change of heart, Two: Humphrey Bogart is America and America is basically keeping to themselves and doesn't want to ""stick its neck out for no one."" It was great to see how it all played out. The plot/ story was great in itself, but the setting and layout of the film was great. There was one point when I felt like I was a patron in the saloon. I also notice how in the scenes when Rich (Bogart) was wearing white while everyone else had black on or gray.

He never falters or stumbles over his words. I also really like how he doesn't lie either, he has nothing to hide. But once the conversation switches to talk of politics, he politely but firmly excuses himself from the conversation, refusing to discuss politics at his café.

516,18 September 2010,paul2001sw-1,7, Surprisingly modern,"Watching 'Casablanca' for the first time one is struck by a number of things: the already-known dialogue (though of course, not including the exact line, ""Play it again, Sam"", which no-one actually says); the swanky nature of Rick's bar, the very un-African nature of Casablanca in general and the fact that Sam, although a minor character, is a black man presented as intelligent and even a friend of the Humphrey Bogart's hero, in a way that can't have been completely normal in 1942. I also like the way that Sam's music is integrated into the film, although in places the soundtrack overdoes the romantic notes. It's also interesting to think about the story-lines chosen by film-makers before the war was won, although the film isn't quite as detached from the allied cause as it first suggests. Overall, it's aged much better than most films of its era, probably because it's mainly a character study, albeit one supported by a heavy dose of wisecracking; and it's stateless characters, drifting through a world that has lost it's certainties, live beyond the bounds of conventional morality in a very matter-of-fact way. Of course it won Oscars, but a comparison with the modern day is telling; in how many contemporary blockbusters does the hero let his girl go?",
517,20 October 2010,rtherock915,10, I love this movie,"Great movie, great music, great story, great acting, great cinematography, great everything. Humphrey Bogart brings his tough but cool persona, Ingrid Bergman brings an elegant but fragile charm, Claude Rains steals every scene he's in with his quick wit and impeccable comedic timing, Conrad Veidt plays the antagonist beautifully and menacingly, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre provide solid support in smaller roles that show off their shadier sides. The story is just perfect, its complicated so it requires constant attention but it moves by so fast and and never lets up that it is a real joy to watch. This film never has a dull moment, it will have you laughing in one scene and in the next it will have wrenched your heart out. Its shot in a romantic but noir type style that is impossible to take your eyes off of. The music is so moody and romantic it fits the music perfectly and it comes in at all the right moments, never taking away from a scene. The acting never goes over the top or anything, it just stays perfect. The person who I think sticks out the most and embodies the feel of this film would have to be Claude Rains. In one moment he can be so riotously funny and in the next he's as serious as he can be, just like the pace of the film. This really is the perfect movie and I strongly urge anyone who has not seen it to see it.",
518,12 December 2020,chetanhasallmoney,8, This review has been written after my first viewing. Humphrey is perfect.,"This take might seem interesting, but I don't love this movie. I like it a lot. I don't think it is a masterpiece. First of all, the story line is simple, a little interesting. At it's time, the film might have felt fresh and new but now it does not hold the same uniqueness. I love Humphrey Bogart's performance in this film. He is so brilliant. He gets that Rick is charming and at the same time hiding his true feelings. Ingrid Bergman is good, but not brilliant. Sometimes when she is talking about some unfortunate things , she feels kinda fake. Paul Hendrid's performance is very enjoyable. His lines are great and quotes win you over. The other characters give okay performances, nothing breathtaking. The love story does not feel finished and I am not talking about the end. The middle scenes in Paris when they just fall in love automatically seems improbable. The cinematography is very beautiful. One more thing, it is an American propaganda film.",

There's something simple and pure about the way it evokes its emotional power, somehow never losing that power over time.  Also, I must say that Humphrey Bogart suddenly became the single man I wanted to be like after watching this film, more than Sean Connery, more than James Dean.  He has this coolness which remains the pinnacle.  True, this style and character is much better shown in The Maltese Falcon.  In Casablanca Bogart is exposed; his coldness came from a broken heart, and he still has some of that compassion left within him. But I still look up to him, and deeply feel for him.",

This movie is all about the subtle messaging so you really need to focus while watching. Also Humphrey Bogart is an acting GOD. The movie is a jumper that never lets up and grips the emotions like few others. The acting is near-perfect and its setting in WW2 makes it easily relatable since the war is an extremely well known historical event. Highly Recommended.,

There is a scene of drinking in the dark with at the piano that is beautifully shot, The light s coming in from, the ,moving spotlight and the smoke of his cigarette is illuminated in a subtle way, and his face is mostly in shadow.

There are a lot of foreign actors in this film as well. It was a great way to portray the message the director was trying to get across which was that the world needed Americas help during the war. This movie although iconic and well known can have its true purpose easily looked over by a viewer today. But back when the film was made it had a huge impact on the views of the war. The sets for each scene are done very well even though most take place in the main characters night club. It has a bit of an eerie feeling added to it from the dim lighting which increase the suspense of the film and add a shady feeling to it. All in all a classic film that should be seen by every movie lover.,
538,5 May 2013,OfficialPaul,10, Possibly the Greatest Romance Movie of All-Time,"One of the best romance movies of all-time. Casablanca made Humphrey Bogart a top star in Hollywood and Ingrid Bergman a respectable actress. Claude Rains is also great in the movie and is an important character. Michael Curtiz, who I believe is one of the greatest directors of all-time, directs this the same year as Yankee Doodle Dandy. Curtiz direction was flawless and the close-ups mainly on Bergmann shown the emotions were great. The cinematography was astounding which makes the viewer seem like they're in the room. Despite the screenplay not being 100% realistic and believable, I don't think anyone cares because of how well and effective the movie is. The dialog is one of the best in cinema history which contains many famous quotes. This movie shows how important romance, friendship, and politics could be. ",

The script is deliciously witty and full of drama, the characters wonderfully crafted and 3-dimensional, the cinematography and sound as classy as anything in its day.

In the end, Rick forces the captain to allow Victor and Ilsa to go to America while he stays behind. This shows how much he loves Ilsa because he wants the best for her even though it meant her going with Victor. A scene that was good in the movie was the national anthems being played in the café. The German's started singing their national anthem. Then Rick cued everyone else to do the French national anthem. This is a key scene because it shows the people actually standing up against the Germans and their invasions. The relationship with Rick and the Captain was also good too.

The characters in Casablanca are so well played and well rounded that it would be hard not to build a bond to each of them by the end of the movie. Humphrey Bogart's role of Rick Blaine is my favorite character by far. His gritty attitude is accompanied by a softer side. The love triangle between Rick, Isla, and Victor really portray Rick's softer side when he ends up choosing to help Ilsa and Rick instead of himself.

563,22 June 2005,silverscreen888,7, A Stirring and Splendidly-Made Wartime Film; Very Well-Acted,"Julius Epstein, one of the writers of ""Casablanca's"" screenplay, has called his script bad names. On philosophical grounds, I must agree with some of his honest objections. However, the production values and general storyline are so beautifully done in this famous cinematic work of art that the film's sterling qualities easily outweigh its relatively minor defects. Of course, the film is somewhat overrated by most moviegoers; but, its scenes and human relationships rank with some of the finest achievements in Hollywood's history. And the acting is far above average, every last line of it. It is to this presentational aspect--and to the characters' motives within the film that perhaps viewers have always responded unusually favorably. The film was set in occupied North Africa during wartime. Between the Vichy French government and the Nazi occupiers, the criminal element and those desperate enough to be driven to commit crimes, the city was a deceptively-calm-appearing and yet a very-dangerous place to be living in those years. And, incidentally, it provided a fine milieu in which to set a dramatic film whose theme is how men ought to face their responsibilities in emergencies. The only way to escape from Casblanca's oasis of deceptive peacefulness was to have ""papers""--legal permission to persuade the authorities to permit such a departure. In fact, the storyline begins with visitors having such papers stolen, by a desperate man who is later killed. The remainder of the plot line can be summed up in two sentences. In the city, an expatriate named Rick runs a large nightspot to whom sooner or later, because he is neutral and accommodating, everybody comes. Enter Ilse, and Viktor Laszlo, she the woman who inexplicably left him in Paris and the man she left him to go back to, a man wanted by the Nazis everywhere as their chief opponent... What happens after this is the outcome of the sorts of people Rick, Ilse and Viktor are, and an enigmatic French police captain beautifully played by Claude Rains. As Rick, Humphrey Bogart is at his best, investing a neutral and too-much-unaccounted-for obvious ex-racketeer with intelligence, a sense of honor and melancholia for his lost love. Ingrid Bergman has little to do but look beautiful and say she is sorry, but she does both wonderfully, as always. Paul Henried as Laszlo is straightforward and capable Others in the very fine cast include Syndey Greenstreet as a rival nightclub owner, S.Z. Sakall the bartender, Leonid Kinskey a larcenous employee, Joy Page as a desperate refugee, Peter Lorre as the unfortunate thief, Dooley Wilson as Rick's segundo and piano player, and able Conrad Veidt as the Nazis' chief. Michael Curtiz's bravura direction controls the film's pace and draws very good performances from his cast. Every element of the film glows with intelligence; the lighting is extraordinary, and the costumes, sets, art direction by Carl Weyl, and Arthur Edeson's cinematography are textbook-class work. Mention should be made of Max Steiner's music and the song ""As Times G By"", first heard in this feature. Scenes such as the entry of Ilse into Rick's, the roulette wheel payoff, the rival singing of the Marseillaise to drown out the Nazis' song, the killing of the thief, the closing of Rick's and the justly-famous climax at the airport in the fog need no elaboration by me. What is questionable is the ending, in which Rick gives up Ilse, at least for now, because Viktor Laszlo needs her; the stronger ending would have been for Laszlo to give her up to Rick and say, ""Do you think so little of me as to imagine I'd let you do a 'sacrifice'? I need only my liberty, as every man does. I have my work--it's enough for me for now. Happiness such as yours and the freedom to enjoy it again is what I'm fighting for. What we're all fighting for! So, we go on together or not at all."" But this flaw is less important than the careful build in tension achieved within the film, less vital than the gradual awakening of righteous anger in men who had stayed out of the battle between brutality and justice too long already. The film has a great deal to say about what men should do in the face of evil; and much of the time, it says it very well indeed.",

The club ran by Rick is the main setting for the movie. The sound is mesmerizing, especially the piano playing by Sam. The lighting is dark, and definitely exudes a noir quality. The scene where Rick is drinking at his bar all alone with Sam,you can see the chandeliers reflecting light. It was a nice touch to the mood of the scene.

The scenery that is presented in this film are simply gorgeous. The lighting in the nightclub gives a cozy feel to it. The nightlife in Casablanca itself feels so lively since the nightclub that is owned by Rick Blaine is always filled with people. Not only that but the characters in the film have character development which is something I am always glad to see in films.

We watch our main character, Rick Blaine, who is a sour man who wants to stay neutral with the conflicts going down at his cafe, turn into a man who takes a stand for himself and others. He never wanted to get involved, but it became necessary. The audience can't help but feel for him and Ilsa; their pain, pity and pride feel so real through the screen. The writing of this film was well-done and the score always hit at the right moments. At some moments, however, I felt were slow, but it could've been purposeful. The editing works perfectly with what the audience needs to see. Casablanca is a beautiful story that was beautifully filmed!",

The innovations not only in story telling and filmmaking but also in social commentary are breathtaking. The makers of Casablanca employ many camera techniques that really opened the door for modern film and set the stage in ways we hadn't seen before. In addition, the film portrays a nice element of diversity and takes on the war from a critical lens.

576,10 September 2009,pip_2,10, 'This story doesn't have an ending yet...',"About 2/3 into Casablanca, Humphrey Bogart's Rick says to Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa that this story doesn't have an ending yet. It is profoundly true, and this could be said of the ending of Casablanca also. Although Rick and Ilsa may well have said their very last goodbyes, the stories of these, and many other characters, in Casablanca are far from over at the 'end' of the film. What happened after Ilsa and Laszlo got on that plane? Did Louis and Rick's beautiful friendship last beyond the runway? And whatever happened to Sam? This is what makes Casablanca a truly unique film; you could make another three or four films about what happens to the characters after Louis and Rick walk off into the mist and it wouldn't get boring. It also gives Casablanca not just a great ending but one of the best in cinema history because it ties up the main story but leaves lots of other stories and questions unanswered before the events of the film as well as after like Rick's shady past in the US before he came to Casablanca.",
577,9 January 2001,Alex-506,5," Sorry to be a downer, but here's what I think of Casablanca.","I do not like Casablanca.  Wait!  Before I'm burned at the stake, hear me out.  One of the problems I have with Casablanca is that it tries to exist on two different plains.  It expects us be drawn into the emotional struggle that Rick undergoes throughout the movie.  But no matter how hard I tried (and believe me I wanted to love this movie), the film failed on the emotional level.  Rick, as played by Humphrey Bogart, seemed horrifically ingenuine.  He continually spewed out dialogue which pandered, even insulted, the audience.  ""I stick my neck out for no one"", ""Rick never drinks with anyone"", etc., etc.   These lines are definitely memorable, but a capable actor could have communicated Rick's veneer of cynicism without words, and trusted the audience's intelligence to figure it out.  Indeed, it is this constantly simplistic dialogue, as well as the cardboard performance by Bogart, that continually held me back.  I couldn't plunge into the emotional power of the film as I wanted to, and indeed I began to grow annoyed by the film because it seemed as if it didn't believe its own convictions.  It seemed as if it would rather be hip than genuine.  The film is not without its strong points, definitely: the great performances by Bergman, Rains and Wilson, the surehanded direction of Curtiz, and the memorable song ""As Time Goes By"".  But Casablanca failed to draw me in emotionally, and also failed to invoke the feeling of Casablanca at that time.  Compared to great films like The Third Man (which invoked the paranoia of Cold War Vienna), Schindler's List (the closing walls of the Holocaust) and Saving Private Ryan (the chaos of war), Casablanca fails miserably in comparison.  Whenever I see Casablanca, I am always a little saddened.  It could have been a great and profound film.  Instead, it is a mediocre escapist entertainment.",

No one could know the events that would occur in the following years, as the world waged the brutal battles of World War II. Yet, out of the growing global chaos, Curtiz was able to direct a masterpiece that will continue to rank among the best films ever made. This is classic, quintessential ""Bogey"" at his very best.

Its unique story of a love triangle set against terribly high stakes in the war against a monster is sophisticated instead of outlandish, intriguing instead of garish. Humphrey Bogart plays the allegedly apolitical club owner in unoccupied French territory that is nevertheless crawling with Nazis; Ingrid Bergman is the lover who mysteriously deserted him in Paris; and Paul Heinreid is her heroic, slightly bewildered husband. Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Conrad Veidt are among what may be the best supporting cast in the history of Hollywood films.

If anything it's the reverse. What greater compliment to a film screenplay can a film audience make than so completely absorbing every word of it into its common cultural consciousness? It took me a long time and multiple viewings before I warmed up to Michael Curtiz's 1943 film (by some accounts a 1942 release). I'm not particularly a fan of either Ingrid Bergman or Humphrey Bogart, and the film-making techniques didn't strike me as anything inventive or unique and they still don't.

Strasser and Claude Rains was simply superb as Capt. Renault. The film is loaded with classic lines and characters. Even down to the minor players, it was perfectly cast. Thank heavens that the original casting fell through. George Raft, fine actor though he was, could not have played Rick, Hedy Lamarr would not have been able to pull off Ilse, and it would have been even more dreadful if Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan had been cast.As it is, ""Casablanca"" is the greatest film ever made.",

This has more action than UK's ""Brief Encounter"", but the on-screen tension between the main male and female lead is just as intense (if not more so). They are both stories of people falling in love - who shouldn't fall in love, and as with all great films you have to wait until the final scenes to find out who gets the girl. Casablanca has much more humour than Brief Encounter, but then it was filmed a long, long way from any actual military conflict.

In the film, Rick is a typical selfish bar/saloon owner that ""sticks his neck out for nobody"" until romance gets involved. I really love how a large portion of the middle of the movie is a flashback to how Rick fell in love.

614,15 November 2002,bsinc,6, What is it about this movie??????,"I found ""Casablanca"" to be pretty unentertaining, funny at moments(sometimes unintentionally), but not worthy of being called a movie classic. Hell no! It's just another movie where Bogart is trying to look like he's to cool for school, and Bergman isn't anything special either. The best moments come from Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault and the best acting is played out by Paul Henreid. However, the story's what really sucks here. If that's really how people used to live half a century ago, then thank god for the 60's and the 70's. And if I'm is supposed to believe that in real life the love triangle would unfold as it does on the big screen or that Bergman just goes along with Bogart's last minute decision that she's in love with Victor Lazslo after all, leaving Bogie, the love of her life behind, well, then I'm offended. If that young couple just needed money to buy their way out of Casablanca, then why the hell didn't Bogart do the same. He was loaded. We're supposed to believe his character's background of being so terribly in love, experiencing a loss of that love, an over acted performance of going through pain when he rediscovers that love, yet in the final scene he doesn't show any sign of true heart break or any kind of pain. He decides he's going to cling to the past and let the love of his life, the only woman he ever loved and will ever love fly away forever. Pretty cheesy. But with some good one liners.     7/10",

His character is powerfully dynamic and gripping, one cannot predict his actions. The casting and character writing are quite superb, everyone complements each other and Rick and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) create a powerful, passionate foil. The direction and lighting of the film are also very complementary to the great final product. Throughout the film there seems to be two different color and light schemes. The flashbacks offer bright and pretty light to go along with the uplifting flashback storyline. Once back in the bar the lighting is dark and ominous, giving the watcher the idea that something is not right in Casablanca. Casablanca has become an iconic film for numerous reasons, but one reason stands out. This film is about the struggle in a worn torn country and the struggle with ones past.

The film's issues and themes are very much on the surface, and one is able to notice how poorly some of the characters are constructed when it is known already what is to happen on a second viewing.

The movie starts with the murder of a  German courier who had been ambushed in the desert.. He was carrying two transit visas.

In addition, it's great way to analyze movies evolution : so in the two movies, we have a frontier neutral town before liberty, bad guys and rebels, a saloon-keeper who doesn't take side, a police officer who is not very clean, a fat guy managing black market, two tickets for a plane and for sure an old love getting hot again ! With that, i would say that the most recent movie shows more but as it's silly contents (nakedness, violence), the effect to the movie is useless. Here, we just have the characters speaking and interacting in a civilized way, so the old movie is thousand more thrilling because it's only psychological ! So those old movies in black and white and using out-of-date technology are not finally boring but are rather more punchy than the actual ones because they cut to the essential : humans feelings and relationships ! Anyway, this old one has indeed a fabulous cast : as said by Lynch, it's true that Isabella looks like her mother, Bogart shows than less is more but for me, the magic lies with the black and white : it's so full, so complementary in costumes, the white saloon, the black night, the shadows that it was like seeing a color movie ! For sure as a french, i really appreciated when our hymn mutes Nazis songs and regarding to the date of production, i keep in mind the line « Even Nazi can't kill so fast », which was proved totally worst a few months later !!",

The films now a day just seem to descend into gratuitous violence, sex and profanity. Each film seems to need to out do the previous when it comes to explosions. Some films makers should look back and review the classics like Casablanca and maybe be a renegade film maker and not give in to the Holly Wood lowered expectations. Mr. Bogart's delivery of sarcasm is second to none. And what he had to do for the woman he loved in the move. His to classic lines that still resonate even to this day, usually miss quoted, but there are still here. 1943 is long gone and the world has moved on, we have new dangers in the world, but the fad in movies is use bigger guns that expel more bullets.

Specifically there are two scenes early on that allow Rick to get the letters of travel and Victor to know of their location. Both scenes have to hang a lantern on the character motivations to make them believable. Unfortunately in retrospect it is rather obvious what the screenwriters ended up doing to get the plot to work. It makes the entire film feel a bit off.,
641,12 September 2021,TheHonestCritic,4," A cinematic masterpiece? Or, just another overrated movie? Check out my review below!","""Casablanca"" (1942), oh man, I'm probably going to get a lot of anger for this review. But, as you all know, I'm honest with my opinions and I will always be honest. All right, I'll just tell you right off the bat, I'm not a big fan of love stories or romance films. So, as you can imagine, I wasn't that enthused about watching this movie. Now, I didn't watch it voluntarily, I watched it in one of my film school classes in college. Much to my surprise, it's better than I thought it would be. Sure it has problems, but there are some good things as well. Overall, it's just a mixed bag for me. ""Casablanca"" has a predictable and cliched storyline, dated special effects and a generic soundtrack. The plot is, an American expatriate named Rick Blaine is stuck in a dilemma. He's forced to choose between his love for a woman, or helping her and her husband escape from the currently Vichy-controlled Casablanca, so he can continue with his fight against the Germans. At first glance, this story does sound interesting, as dilemmas are a strong factor in the genre of drama or romance films. Unfortunately, half of the story works, and the other half doesn't. Here's a fun fact for you: the movie was shot in the chronological order of the story, which is a rare thing in film. The first half of the script was complete before production began, but the other half wasn't. Ironically, the already completed half before filming is where the movie drags. The second half of ""Casablanca"" is a lot better and stronger for me, both with plot and acting. Another problem, is that this movie doesn't really have a villain in it. I suppose that some will argue that the closest thing to an antagonist is the Germans. The problem with that, is that the primary antagonist here is way too vague and they don't really stand out. All films need to have strong protagonist(s) and antagonist(s) in them, that's the basics of writing. Granted, there are movies with little to no villains that are executed better. Had ""Casablanca"" included a real villain, it might've allowed more room for extra potential. As I said, there are good things thrown in the mix throughout this film. For example, it has not one, not two, not three, but six fantastic lines in it! How about that? My top three favorites are: ""of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine."" My second favorite is: ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" My top favorite of the six is: ""here's looking at you, kid."" All six quotes are fantastic! But, those three lines in particular really stand out, in my opinion. If only the writing was as good as those lines, this movie could've been a huge masterpiece! The ending is one of the best parts of the film, if not the best part. That scene where Rick Blaine and Ilsa Lund say goodbye to each other at the airport. No one's going to argue that's not an iconic scene. Had the movie been as strong as it's second half, the storyline would've been perfect. Granted, in some cases, it's not how you start, it's how you finish. That being said, in the world of cinema, you need a strong opening, a strong ending and a strong centerpiece in the middle to tie it together in the end. A film has to work as a whole, not in parts, otherwise it will not mesh together. The special effects are good, especially for it's time. However, there are some once in a while that are just dated and a bit cheesy. Now, let's get to the positive elements of this movie. As for the acting, it ranges from top-notch to just average. One unique thing about the cast, is that it's heavily international, which I think is great. Fun fact: there are only three American actors among the whole cast; Humphrey Bogart, Dooley Wilson, and Joy Page. The rest of the actors and actresses are all foreign. Most of the acting is average, but some of it is exceptional. The biggest standout performances come from Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains. Even though a lot of the acting was average for the most part, I still give it a pass, thanks to the three standouts I've listed. All of the sets/locations are beautiful and they give the film a stunning atmosphere. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Max Steiner is excellent and sets a great tone for the movie itself. A lot of film scores he composes are fantastic, and this one here is no different. ""Casablanca"" is considered one of the greatest films of cinema. Do I think it deserves such praise? No, I honestly think it's way too overrated, in my opinion. But, that doesn't mean it's void of positive things. However, at the same time, there are negatives throughout, especially in the first half. As I said earlier, half of the story works and the other half doesn't. I'm giving this film 3 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 6 out of 10 IMDB stars. A 3 out of 5 star rating is dividing mark where I differentiate a movie being good or bad. ""Casablanca"" is a marginal 3 out of 5/6 out of 10 and I consider it, by my standards, a bad movie. There are very few romance films that I actually enjoy. ""Casablanca"", in a way, is like a satire of love stories. Ordinarily, that would be a good thing, as satire movies can be decent homages to other media. Unfortunately, ""Casablanca"" is just an overrated mess that has not earned any love from me.",
642,24 October 2020,pietoso,10, Here's Humphrey!,"Reviewing Casablanca runs the risk of many unpleasantries, for instance: to say again what has been said ad infinitum, to be swept up in sweet, simpering praise, and so on. At minimum I'll probably manage the two mentioned. Casablanca really has it all as films go, from masterful, iconic performances by film legends to some of the best writing ever committed to a page of script. It seems to invite hyperbole, perhaps because it's so effective when it comes to eliciting an emotional response from the viewer. The romance between Bogart's Rick and Bergman's Ilsa hits all the right notes as far as drama goes. Melodramatic but tastefully so, measuredly bitter when called for, it has an incredible ability to court excess without falling into it. Besides the two mentioned above, who do surely deserve all the praise they have ever received for their performances, the remainder of the cast is somehow nearly as excellent. In particular the unbelievably debonair Claude Rains constantly shines, and Dooley Wilson's Sam delivers at least one of the most memorable scenes in cinema with inimitable style and tenderness. However, the real star of the picture might just be the screenplay, highly effective at counterbalancing tension and romance even as it generously leaves us with a few certifiable gems for the Film Quote Hall of Fame. These elements, along with the sets, the lighting, and every other factor collectively make up some of the most potent shots I can recall: Les Marseilles in a raucous café, Bogart and Bergman locking eyes luminescent across a shadowy room, fog choking a dimly lit airfield as a great romance concludes. Casablanca may not be a perfect film, or the greatest, but it has all the qualities of a candidate at the very least.",

It definitely gets confusing with all of the characters, but after the second or third time I started to see how great of a movie it really is and how much it stands apart from other movies during it's time period. Casablanca tells multiple stories depending on how you look at it. It tells the tale of a love story, that gets a little crazy, a political story about the war and what effects it has on peoples lives, and also shows the changes the characters go through personally, like with Ricks opinion on war. It definitely is overlooked by many because it is often misunderstood, but I definitely would recommend giving it a watch!",

This film was not intended to be a classic.  What happened?  One can watch this movie without sound and marvel at the human struggle in northern Africa. Did Michael Curtiz perfect his directorial technique during the silent film era?  Obviously his silent film experience is evident.  Why watch Casablanca with the sound off?  One would miss the orchestration by Max Steiner and vocal by Arthur Dooley.  The dialogue is very rich, the plot compelling and acting perfect.

658,2 August 2010,edie000738,10, What can you say about an American Classic that hasn't already been said?,"What can you say about an American film classic like Casablanca that hasn't already been said? I'm not sure, but as one of my favorite films, I'll give it a try. Most of the film Casablanca takes place in Rick's Café Americain – a nightclub in the Moroccan city of Casablanca that lends itself to people looking for a way to escape the Nazis; these can include refugees, gamblers, even crooks. Rick's is owned by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Rick has gone to Casablanca to escape the Nazi's, a lost love and ""sticks his neck out for no one."" The plot centers on some letters of transit that have been given to Rick for safe keeping. The letters will allow the bearer to escape to the United States, and freedom. Unknown to Rick is that these papers are the reason that his lost love Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband Victor (Paul Henreid) find their way into Rick's nightclub. Rick is torn between using the papers for him to get out of Casablanca and take Ilsa with him, or give the papers to the couple, so that they can escape the Nazis. Also central to the story line is the song As Time Goes By, a song that was special to Ilsa and Rick during their romance in Paris. Rick has forbid Sam (Dooley Wilson) his piano player to play the song since Ilsa left him alone at the train station in Paris. When Ilsa and Victor come into the club, Ilsa convinces Sam to ""Play It Again Sam, Play It Again."" When Rick hears it, he is furious, until he sees who requested the song. Thus begins the revival of Rick and Ilsa's love affair. Even though by today's standards the scenery and special effects are outdated and at times seem corny, it doesn't detract from the charm, romance, mystery and allure of the story of the film. The lighting and camera angles used to shoot the film contribute to the mystery and allure of the city of Casablanca as well. This can specifically be seen in the lighting and camera angles used for the close-ups of Ilsa. The soft, diffused lighting on her face, gives her an almost angelic quality. The emotions are so evident in her expressions, especially her eyes. While watching this film, the lighting used, reminded me of another of Ingrid Bergman's later films, The Bells of St. Mary's. The lighting used seemed to be similar, and in The Bells of St. Mary's, Ms. Bergman played a nun, so she was angelic in a way. I found that the film Casablanca still held the same allure, mystery and romantic adventure after viewing it for the 20th time as it held the first time.",
659,22 June 2013,stefan_epangeac,10, The best movie ever made,"For me, the 40s and the 70s are are my favorite movie periods. I should include the 30s also. It is the period of the greatest scripts, they are great even in our days, and also the period of the coolest actors ever to appear on screen. Humphrey Bogart is one of them, and Casablanca is the film that shined most in the 40s. Casablanca has the best script including legendary lines i think 6 of them are included in AFI top 100 lines. It' not just a love story, it's that love story that seems impossible, due to the time when the characters met, and the circumstances in witch they feel in love. Probably, the best scene in the movie is the one with ""la Marseillaise"". It has such deep signification, it's the French national anthem played in a French region in Africa under German occupation during WW II, played while the Germans sang a patriotic song. The scene is presented in great detail, from the beginning, where the band look to Bogart for his approval, to Victor Laszlo' hand gestures and Ilsa's heavy breathing suggesting that she is proud of Laszlo's intention, to the end when a a woman in the crowd with a visible tear shouts ""Vive La France"". The song starts in a shy matter for the French crowd, but it increases immediately and the German are forced to stop singing because they can not be heard anymore. It has the meaning of freedom, of liberty. When you watch this scene you feel good, you think of what the public though when it was first released; back then the war was still on; maybe they though that the war will be over that the good will eventually conquer evil. To conclude, watch this movie, you will love it, you will love the French anthem scene even if you are not French. You will not find a better script or better actors.",

Also it offers a different look at the war environment, which through Morocco's Casablanca buffer state. which offer the condition where Nazi officials and resistance members can face one another without necessarily fearing an immediate shootout.

You just don't see such quality in movies anymore. Movies like Casablance pertain to what was going on in the world at the time. It is one thing to just entertain, but quality entertainment is the best. Casablanca had a great cast and Bogurt absolutely made the movie. He gave Americans a tough guy look back in the 40's when this was released. He had a good sense for what was authentic and what was phooey. He also did a good job portraying what heartbreak is like for men. The way he tricked everyone but in the end saved the say for everyone and made some characters realize what they should represent.

This is one love story that can never be pushed to the side as a chick flick because any guy would like this movie as well. A real masterpiece in cinema. Personally, I appreciate and enjoy movies that are simple and not too long, but they still leave you breathless and wanting to watch them again when they are finished. Casablanca is a great movie that allows the viewer to personally take a stake in the plot and watch as events leave them sad, horrified, heartbroken and elated at the same time.

The setting is a near perfect place for the story to take place. A city full of refugees and soldiers from both sides allows the filmmakers to explore the attitudes of the nations at the time in a way that does not actually show the conflict. American neutrality is shown through Rick, and German warmongering is shown through the many German soldiers. There are, of course, other characters from other nations as well. In addition to this the film has a compelling love story and is endlessly quotable. The ending is one of the most iconic of all time. It is not a happy ending although there is some solace to be had with Rick and Louis' new friendship. There is seemingly an endless amount of praise that can be given to this incredible film.",

The theme is just as important today as it was then and perhaps this is the reason it is a timeless classic.

""As Time Goes By"" (which is the staple song of the movie) is so amazing and resonates so much. I was very fortunate in the fact that, despite the fact I am only 14, I was able to see this movie in the theater the first time i saw it. It is an amazing movie and I recommend it for anyone and everyone no matter what age. Also, the special edition DVD has excellent extra features that everyone will love. The timeless coupling of Ingrid and Bogart is amazing, the chemistry is so real. The timeless lines are also some of the most amazing ever written.

It has a rugged, square-jawed hero, bad guys (not just Nazis, but the French who would betray their own country to the Nazis), a pretty girl (very pretty), exotic locales, and lines that everyone can recite, a la Rocky Horror Picture Show. Lots of fun. However, the fact that this is on the IMDB top 250 is sad. There are at least 250 films better than it (notice I say ""better than"" not ""that I like more,"" nor ""that you like more""). Degustibus non disputandus est. I will grant that. However, art has tougher criteria than ""I like it, and my opinion counts because I am Me!"" Casablanca is a disjointed muddle of a film. It is cliche ridden, as subtle as a ton of dynamite, and does not come close to true masterpieces of film art. Want to see a good wartime film with good heros and bad villains? See Rome, Open City or La Notte di San Lorenzo.",
679,19 May 2004,erik150x,3, Casablah...,"I found this movie mildly engaging, and that may be a gross overstatement. The characters are cliché, with very little depth. There is nothing I could see particularly insightful or original in this movie. It was as bland as a baked potato with no garnishings, not even some salt. Perhaps this is the type of movie that people who don't like to have to think to much, like. The plot is not so bad, it had potential, but seemed to be left to wither in the hands of a weak script and somewhat inept acting. Who is Bogart supposed to be, James Bond with a broken heart? Trying to put this ultra cool James Bond character into the ""real"" world, just doesn't work for me. I never really find Bogart's character believable, so I never really connect with the character. The catch phrase lines, like ""Here's lookin' at you kid."" are as profound as Schwatzenager's ""I'll be back"". If this was an action type adventure story like Raider's of the Lost ark, I could overlook some of these things. But this movie seems to be first and foremost a love story. And in that sense, I think it fails. I could go on with much more criticism of this movie, but I don't want to beet it to death. It is not an awful movie, more of a very light cute little thing. But one of the greatest movies of all time??? Eeeh Gods, how can that be?!!! Perhaps Hollywood is not so off the mark when they dumb down movies for the general public.",

Humphrey Bogart was the man who more than any other I wanted to be and who, in occasional fantasies, I imagined I was. Ingrid Bergman was the woman I wanted to love and protect from all dangers. At first, Paul Henreid did not really fit into my calculations. The idea of the noble sacrifice was quite new to me then, but I caught on quickly and, having toyed with the idea that Henreid instead of Bogart should have gone off to Brazzaville with Claude Rains, I realized that things had to work out as they did, and I felt better for accepting the fact.",

His performances will always stand out, no matter how many years pass. Another outstanding performance in this film is by Paul Henreid, who plays Victor Lazlo, an underground hero and bane to the Nazis. There is a part in this film that always overwhelms me. At Rick's place, the Nazi soldiers have all gathered and start singing their ""National Anthem"" much to the chagrin of the rest of the customers, who are mostly French. France has already fallen and is occupied by the Germans, so these people are very downhearted at hearing this Anthem being sung. At that point, Lazlo (Henreid) walks over to the band and demands that they play ""La Marseillaise"", and they do, causing everyone to stand and sing, showing their allegiance to France. The German singers are then drowned out by the French. It is overwhelming and is like a look into the future of the war and Hitler's ultimate defeat.

Although it was not a ""love at first sight"" the movie left something in me. However  and I must apologize to those that are true fans of the movie  when I started thinking about it I felt it was very difficult to appreciate it to the fullest, simply because of it's age. I know this has more to do with me that with the movie itself, but the format, the direction, the acting, well, the structure of the movie, is very related with it's time (obviously). This is not a critic, just something that I'd noticed for a long time and now had the opportunity to express: most of the movies below a certain date (for me maybe 1970) report to things that a younger generation has some difficulty apprehending ( it was in the mid nineties that I became more aware of the movie world), mostly because what was interesting and new 60 years ago is not necessarily so now. This feeling is more about all the other movies than about Casablanca itself. It's very natural to see it, without thinking it's an old movie; somehow it feels right. Only with Citizen Kane have I felt the same. Of course it's remarkable that so many years after it was made it still holds something special. About the restwell, forgive the relief.",

After seeing him in the Maltese Falcon which I thought was a brilliant film I decided to give this a try, although I am not really into romantic films as this certainly is. The love story is truly one of the more memorable ones but it would have been contrived without the war time setting. Everything the characters do may have long lasting effects on their lives or in some cases may even claim their lives. The Rick character, who is supposed to be completely neutral, can't escape being an accomplice in what the Laszlo character is deeply involved in. It's not only because he loves Ilsa (Bergman) but you can see that he hates the Germans as much as anybody when he first meets Major Strasser. That aside the Bogart character would never send a decent man to his doom as Laszlo essentially is, even though he is a rather cold hearted bore.",

Bogart, Bergman, Rains, Greenstreet, Lorre, and so on. But I think that Casablanca made its biggest impression when it came out, in the heat of WWII, and its reputation has carried it along ever since. I'm certain that very few will agree with me on this, but I think that many occasional movie watchers and many would-be experts like to chatter about this film's ""greatness"", when in fact, it has very little of that. Number one problem for me is Bogart as anyone's love interest --- think about this: his very best performances weren't romantic, or anywhere near it(I give ""African Queen"" a comedy designation). The other problem is the dated silliness (in the so-called comic characters) that I suppose was put in to balance the seriousness of being stranded in Casablanca with Nazis buzzing around everywhere. Then there's that ever-present song...not bad, but very over-used. Since I know I'll stir up a lot of folks, I apologize for criticizing the ""perfect film"", but there are just too many truly great ones out there to get all blubbery about this one.

It can also be said to be a bar. No one knows his past, no one knows why he came to Casablanca. Rick 's coffee shop became the main trading location for the Casablanca pass, and because of his management, police chief Renault turned a blind eye to it. It wasn't until the arrival of the leader of the Resistance Army Victor and his wife Ilsa that all this was broken, followed by the German major who was staring at him. When Ilsa stepped into Rick's cafe for the first time, all of their memories returned to Paris. The two people admired each other and loved each other. Rick's romance moved Ilsa, and Rick's silent support for the rebels also made Ilsa appreciate. But Ilsa has entrusted Victor with him for life. Soon, the Germans captured Paris and Rick decided to take Ilsa to Casablanca. At this time, Ilsa accidentally learned that Victor had escaped from the German concentration camp. The dilemma, she chose to leave Rick, leaving Rick to wait alone in the rain. Over time, Ilsa is still the former Ilsa, but Rick is no longer like the previous Rick. He looks cold and ruthless, bureaucratic, and profit-seeking, and because Ilsa's betrayal can not be relieved for a long time, this image of Rick undoubtedly makes Ilsa feel lost. But Rick actually didn't change at all. He first agreed to hide the exit certificates of the Victors for the arrested dealer Ugarte, and provided the money for the exit certificate for a couple who wanted to leave Casablanca to settle in New York. Director Renault 's gun forced him to let Victor and his wife leave the country, and at the airport Ilsa expressed Rick 's willingness to stay in Casablanca with him for the rest of his life. The German major who was going to block was sent to Xitian, and he left Casablanca with the tacit consent of the police chief. In the troubled times, Rick loves Ilsa so persistently. At the Paris station, he continues to wait even if he is soaked. Even if he thinks that he is hurt by Ilsa, he still wants to listen to her explain the matter. Under the cold mask, Rick is willing to pay any price for the beloved person and career, and is also willing to accomplish the career and love of others. Pleasant bureaucracy has become his amulet in troubled times. Rick is clever and hides his enthusiasm with coldness. He insists on pursuing love but is tolerant to his lover who hurt himself in the past. Rick has no handsome appearance, but his charm is infinite. As Renault said, no woman will fall in love with Rick. Maybe the highest state of being is like Rick",

I was a little bit confused at times about who was who, what they wanted, where they were from, and where they wanted to go. Casablanca is about a man from America named Rick who owns a very popular nightclub in Casablanca, a town full of people from all over the place trying to get to America but it's not that easy because World War II was going on. The beginning of the movie involves the police rounding up suspects who might have possession of letters of transit because they were stolen after the murder of two German officials. The letters of transit allowed whoever had them to travel freely which would make it easy for whoever had them to get to America. Rick met a girl, Ilsa, while he was in Paris before he came to Casablanca who he really loved and she planned to run away with him but when Rick went to leave she was nowhere to be found. One night Ilsa and her husband showed up at Rick's café. He was shocked, he thought he would never see her again. Rick was tipped of that she was there when the piano player at his café started to play a song that he told him never to play but Ilsa requested it. Ilsa needs the letters to get to America but Rick didn't give them to her at first. She then held a gun to him and demanded he give her the letters and when she didn't shoot him she admitted that she still loved him and that when they meet in Paris she thought her husband died at a concentration camp. However, she found out he was actually alive and that was why she didn't go with Rick that morning and didn't give him any explanation. At the end, it seemed like Ilsa was going to stay with Rick but when they got to the airport Rick made her get on the plane with her husband even though she wanted to stay with him. He told her she would regret it if she didn't get on the plane so she eventually did but not before an officer got in the way and tried to stop them from boarding the plane. Rick shot him and Ilsa and her husband got on the plane. When the other police arrive, the officer who witnessed the shooting told them to round up the usual suspects in order to protect Rick from getting in trouble for shooting him. The end shows Rick walking away with the man who didn't turn him in and Rick saying the famous line of ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" I didn't hate this movie but it definitely wasn't one of my favorites. The acting was great but I thought it was kind of boring and it didn't really change setting too much, the whole movie pretty much took place in Rick's café.",

In the city of Casablanca there are stone sidewalks, and dim lights. Ricks Café and the Blue Parrot are just two of the many ""cool"" places to be in Casablanca. The characters also fit in well with the story. Although I did not care much for Ilsa. This is because it always seemed as though she wanted to ""have her cake and eat it too.""

758,19 November 2015,eabakkum,7," A review should stick to the facts, and bar emotions","I inherited the DVD Casablanca from my father. My parents belonged to the war generation and were liberated from the German occupation by the American army. Consequently in the fifties and sixties they received every American novelty with awe. American films had a cult status, and certainly Humphrey Bogart, and definitely the war film Casablanca. Bogard has a good name. He said rightly: ""You are not a star until they can spell your name in Karachi"". Dave Chasen said of him:""Bogey is a hell of a nice guy until 11.30 p.m. After that he thinks he is Bogart"". In Cacablanca an American hero turns out to be a veritable chevalier as well. So these are my tender emotions, when I watch the film. However, all generalizations are false. A review should stick to the facts, and bar emotions. And in the light of day the script of Casablanca looks a little shaky. The town is portrayed as the center of human trafficking, which is evidently a dirty business. Therefore it seems slightly unlikely that the local bar owner would have a heart of gold, like Bogart. Joke to make this review even better: a penguin walks into a bar, and asks the bartender: ""Have you seen my brother?"" The bartender replies: ""I don't know. What does he look like?"" In addition the film characters of Bogart and Bergman are somewhat unpleasant. Bogart keeps reproaching Bergman how she has hurt his feelings. A normal person would be glad to have gotten rid of her. Never buy a car you can't push. And Bergman is unable to chose between her two lovers. In the end she leaves the decision to Bogart, which is either preposterous or cunningly clever. Sometimes the best helping hand you can give is a good, firm push. A normal person would assume, that apparently her two lovers are both inadequate. Fortunately, even when a film has an unconvincing narrative, it can still be saved by the quality of the separate scenes. In this respect Casablanca has definitely some excellent moments to offer. A face can say so many things. Especially the mouth part. Therefore it still deserves a positive recommendation. Play it again. Don't forget to leave comments. I love it.",

All the best scenes (apart from the last one) take place at Ricks. Which are, in my opinion, the best reasons to watch the film. Bogart is mostly good, even really good at times, and the supporting cast is strong. Though I do not find Bergman all that alluring, despite her beauty. Is this a classic movie? Definitely. Flawed? I think so.",

Casablanca is one of the very few movies that have succeeded in doing so.  Why that is so is a great mystery.  Maybe its the way everything blends together, maybe its the way it was all put together, maybe, maybe.  Analysing this is sometimes fruitless.  All one can say is that watching this movie over and over again makes us feel good!!!  Need one say more?",

763,11 March 2015,Cinemarker,10, Truly a Timeless Classic,"Casablanca is a movie that most people hear about. A lot of Cartoons give a nod to it in some way, it has been parodied multiple times, and it has influenced numerous other films. Casablanca is a movie I had thought was always over-hyped and placed on a pedestal for no reason other than it being a ""classic"". After watching the film however I understand the hype. It is a timeless movie filled with romance, drama, and the occasional witty line. Bogart and Bergman have an electric chemistry and just look well together overall. Although they do not end up together in the end, Ilsa (Bergman) and Rick (Bogart) share a romance on screen that truly shows that ""if you love something set it free."" Rick risks it all to help the woman he once loved, and still probably does love. Aside from the romantic relationships, the friendship that binds Rick and Captain Louis Renault (Rains) appears genuine. They are two men who become entwined with due to unfortunate circumstances and what becomes of them after the film is something that I personally would like to know about.",

It was great to find out just how many people he really would help in times of need. The way he would let people win in roulette was great. Michael Curtiz did a great job of having the audience feel as though they were at Casablanca at the time, that was done by great acting as well as scenery necessary to get the job done. Ingrid Bergman did an excellent job as well, her facial expressions and the way she spoke, she fit the role perfectly. She had an innocent tone to her voice which created more of a dramatic sequence to every scene she was in, it gave the sad and happy pieces to the film an extra boost of emotion which was great.",

The shadows in the scenes represented the hardships the characters were facing, while the characters shown in the light displays there is nothing to be unsure of. Laszlo is a character that is not shown in the dark, and that represents him as a character. Meanwhile, Rick is often shown in the casted shadows while he is facing internal hardships, struggling to act for himself or for the greater good.

When you see Rick's frown, you will be able to tell how much pain he suffered and concealed in the deep heart while you don't know whether he will return to the ""bright side"" or not. All the other actors also done quite well. They may amuse you in a serious way or in a comic way--that is to be discovered by yourself. As time goes by, the song AS Time Goes By has occupied a part of American culture or even a part of the whole world's culture. I have heard it in a couple of advertisements or in the beginning of a TV programme. That was before watching the film. However, it is always like a warm stream running out of my heart each time I hear the song, after I saw it. Everybody has something within, which is extremely unique, precious and beautiful.

786,8 September 1999,allyjack,9," Undoubtedly the happiest of accidents, which doesn't make it any less admirable","Undoubtedly the happiest of accidents, which doesn't make it any less admirable - the movie has a perfect note of romantic fatalism, a wonderful balance of comedy and drama, and a staggering array of memorable lines and incidents: however often you've seen them or heard them quoted, the moments when the screen settles into one of those legendary bits have a privileged electricity about them. The film is highly dependent on its players - apart from Rains, none of the support really has  ample time to sketch much of anything in depth, but they	re all such strong, persuasive types that the movie feels like an extraordinarily deep canvas. Compared to some other movies, Bogart's hard edge is too much a pose, too obviously ready to be wiped away; and although the movie draws strength from its almost mythic location, it's also a way of reducing the actual political elements to the point of near-abstraction - the elements of personal morality flourish here, but then they have an unnatural advantage. None of this matters very much. The movie has such huge emotional depth, representing such an enormous array of incident, that it's a triumph of economy at 100 minutes or so. Bogart is at the absolute peak of anyone's form here - there's no strained sentiment, no apparent grasping for charismatic distance or charm - he's the peak of moral self-definition interacting with a complex world on its own terms.",

Renaud: ""But Casablanca is in the middle of the desert.""  Rick: (In a very non chalant tone), ""I was misinformed."")  This movie has everything; comedy, drama, romance, and tragedy.

Being one of this movie's audience members of today robs me of exactly what the feelings of society were when this movie came out. During my cinema history class, we discussed the significance of this film which served great importance. Although the movie had a bit of a dark view to it (well, it was in black and white) and it seemed a bit confusing at times, it was overall a great movie. I must admit, I did get a bit lost and I felt that the storyline tended to be a bit clear. However, this tale of a war-based romance is gripping and intriguing. The main character, Rick, faces huge life hurdlesincluding facing and finding his long lost love. It is a universal theme of abandoned love, with a historical twist of World War II.

Even Titanic seemed much more convincing. And why is it that Humphrey Bogart is supposed to be such a seductive legend? I find him dull and devoid of expression, much less empathy.

Shot exactly 80 years ago, the film could be seen as a utopia, an oasis of freedom in the middle of a desert of Nazi terror.

The terrific script works unbelievably well with Humphrey Bogart's character Rick, as he moves through life with cynicism and sarcasm. ""I don't stick my neck out for everybody""sums up the Rick we meet in the first quarter of the film.He is courteous to his customers,but for a mysterious reason he is only really concerned about himself and doesn't seem worried about others.Then,our queries are answered.Ingrid Bergman arrives,and it is then we understand the true reason behind Rick's underlying sadness and cynicism.As the film progresses,the audience experiences some of the best on screen chemistry ever seen;Bergman and Bogart are incredible together,in the few scenes they share,their emotions and love for each other is reflected extraordinary by the actors. The fantastic script merges in with their characters so well,as they toy and wonder where their love will take them. The supporting cast of Paul Henreid,Claude Rains and Peter Lorre provide terrific performances to shine with the two co-stars.Now,the ending. Most romance films often end with a conventional happy ending.Michael Curtiz and the Epsteins gave us so much more. As we hoped for Rick and Isla to reunite,Rick's sacrifice in the airport unfolded, and we realised that the ending is not so gloomy after. Rick's sacrifice of letting Isla go with Victor,was undeniably heartbreaking for Rick,yet his sacrifice to do the moral thing for the right cause internally left him redeemed and ultimately content that he did the right thing for his nation. The screenplay in this film is so magnificently woven together with the performances of the actors,iconic dialogue and soundtrack,that it firmly distinguishes itself as the greatest romance film that has graced our screens. It is simply the epitome of great cinema, a preeminent work that is perhaps the most phenomenal film to come out of the Golden Age of Hollywood.",

Set in the city of the film's title, we have Rick Blaine, an American running from something (&/or someone), who owns a nightclub in Casablanca, where the Nazi's have taken over.  When Ilsa walks into the nightclub one night, we soon learn that they were lovers in Paris a few years earlier.  When the Germans march into France, Rick & Ilsa are to leave.  Ilsa never shows up at the train station, & Rick is forced to leave without her.  Rick's character in the present is a tortured soul, who is seemingly going thru the motions, looking for a reason to go on, or for a cause worth fighting for.  By the end of the movie, we find that, by doing the noble thing, it not only gives him the impetus to reconstruct his life once again, but also conveys a powerful message to those of us in the audeince, that message being that while you can physically lose the love of your life, spiritually, she will always be with you. The movie has just the right amount of intrigue, romance, and humor to make it the most unforgettable story ever put on the Silver Screen.  All of the characters, major and minor, are perfect in their roles.  Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of Rick has left an indelible mark on his entire career & life. Ingrid Bergman - Oh, those wet & hypnotic eyes at the climactic end. Claude Raines as Louie adds just the right touch of cynicism & change of pace humor.  Paul Henreid's Victor Laslo inflicts the needed patriotism into the film.  As a matter of fact, both Rick's & Victor's unyielding love for Ilsa is so genuine, that the ending, where Victor goes off with Ilsa, seems so right, as though there shouldn't be any losers in this ""game"".  The evilness of Major Strasser adds the right tone. Casablanca - an all time classic.",
817,18 September 1999,Tommy-92,9," A great movie, that's all there is to it","First of all, the story is mesmerizing; it's one of those movies you have to watch closely to understand, but once you do, are kept in its grip striaght through to the end.  Bogart and Bergman are wonderful together, with marvelous chemistry and sexual tension.  However, both stand on their own two feet very well, and give excellent performances.  Claude Rains is also quite good as the police cheif who is the recipeint of the famous line, ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"".  Which brings us to the glorious dialogue that deserves to be quoted (and undoubtedly will be) until the end of time.  While overly melo-dramatic at times, the film never loses its power and we can always identify with the characters.  Thank God this is one of the better-looking films of its era; most others have only survived in fading prints with muddy sound and fuzzy pictures, but this has always been kept in top-notch condition, to be enjoyed endlessly.  May very well be the greatest film of all time.",
818,28 November 1999,emerson-12,10, It had everything...,"I'll be brief.  Casablanca is probably one of my favorite movies.  It has romance, intrigue, a cast of interesting characters, good guys, bad guys, moral choices, and classic quotes.  In other words, it had everything. While many movies (especially more recent films) have all this and more, Casablanca holds a special place in my heart.  So, as you watch, think of the film more as a symbol rather than trying to compare it to other great films. Casablanca stands alone.",
819,18 March 2020,Mnemosyne15,9, Romance in classics,"The filming was very successful. The classics who made the film are undoubtedly the starring actors in the film. Each of the starring actors perfectly interprets the various characters. Its ingenious acting skills and ingenious personality match have left us classic screen images such as Lectra and Lisa. . The supporting roles are also shining stars, each with its own advantages. Claude Rinns, Pete Lauer, Conrad Witt, and other red corners at the time provided wonderful performances for the film.",
820,22 June 2000,Captain Ed,10, Although commentary is unnecessary ...,"... I simply have to weigh in on what I think may be the greatest movie ever made.  There isn't one bad performance on screen here, and most are brilliant.  Rick, maybe the original anti-hero, played by Bogart at his best.  Claude Rains as the wisecracking, corrupt, and ultimately decent Vichy police captain.  Paul Henreid as Lazlo, urbane, quiet, and unflinching.  And of course, Ingrid Bergman, Ingrid Bergman, Ingrid Bergman.",

826,29 April 2020,Lily_hoho,7," As time goes by, the appeal of Casablanca shows no sign of diminishing.",Part of what makes this wartime Hollywood drama (1942) about love and political commitment so fondly remembered is its evocation of a time when the sentiment of this country about certain things appeared to be unified.,
827,5 June 2020,hooma814,9, This movie reminds me of tasting delicious whisky - this movie is to be savoured,"This movie was a great option to have on in the background and coming and going on a lazy cold day. It was quite compelling, often interrupting whatever else I was distracting myself with. It was hard to not get involved and want the protagonist to come out with a win. Casablanca was satisfying throughout and I felt it was due applause as it closed out. The acting is superb and was definitely a great example to show people who are of the belief that any movie before 1980 is not worth watching. This is a masterclass on all levels!",
828,8 April 2012,NOXiFy,8, Great movie with an excellent story line,This movie was a great see; I'd definitely recommend it to family and friends after watching it because it tells an interesting story (which is hard to find if you're looking for a drama). The photography was excellent and uses many different types of shots to really expose the film as much as possible and give you good views on conversations and the actions by following the 180 - rule. The sound was in sync and sounded great and not muffled or distant like some movies seem. I'd just like to note that I saw the original black & white film and it had a great picture.,

831,30 November 2011,hitzendegen,4," War Propaganda or a ""B"" Movie ? Or Both ?","This is pure War Propaganda in disguise of a ""B"" movie, and as it happens with every politicization of art, it ages quicker. Not that Casablanca has too much to age though, as a film released as a somewhat vulgar piece. The scenarios are cheesy, to which my guess is they didn't have time nor money to elaborate on that. The acting from the two main characters, portrayed by Bogard and Bergson are weak at best. He has basically two face expressions, and switch from number 1 to number 2 when so circumstances dictate.",
832,14 November 2012,m-vandeyar,9, One of the greats,"There isn't much that hasn't already been said about ""Casablanca"". The movie is one of the all-time greats and for good reason. It not only redefines the classic love story but also provides a riveting plot with a truly blockbuster cast. The generally low lighting in the whole of the film really captures the dark, heartbroken, and lonely life of the stoic-faced bar/club owner Rick (Bogart). There is never a dull point in the plot and the characters provide memorable dialogue with flashbacks providing background details of their pasts throughout. A beautiful set and tremendous camera-work round out the other great points of what is arguably the greatest movie of all time. Easily one of the best movies to watch for those who want to experience a real classic.",
833,15 April 2019,amufan,9, Old does not mean Classic...but in this case,"Below is the review I Wrote when I watched this movie for the first time, a couple of years later I decided to give it another try because I found myself really enjoing movies from the 30s to the 60s. I'm not sure what happened the first time I watch this movie perhaps I just wasn't tuned in to the genre and the time period, But whatever the reason I now see what almost everyone else sees this movie truly is a classic of its time, I still don't think the acting is anything but slightly above average but the dialogue is very good and so is the plot, I think the The lesson I learned is some movies need a second chance because sometimes when we watch a movie for the first time we go in watching it for certain expectations so our mind is not open So what we are seeing. I highly suggest anyone who watch this movie only wants and didn't like it to understand the time period in which these movies were made, they couldn't rely on CGI special effects big action they had to rely on good writing good acting and a good plot.",

This film is simply a must see, to say the very least. But what is it that makes 'Casablanca' a classic? One of things would be the acting, which mostly stands out by Humphrey Bogart. He plays Rick Blaine, a man who lives between two constantly opposing sides - Germans and the french. He watches them tare each other apart and he is like the battlefield. Always stomped over.",

At first I could not understand why some odd romance film was so important but after watching it now I see. Part of it is writing, the excellent dialogue that ranges from somber and disheartening to clever hilariousness. Another piece of it is the beauty of a story that always keeps you guessing right up to to end with twists. Last is the top notch acting, this is the film that made Bogart's career and it is easy to see why. Realizing now the significance of WHEN this film was released in relation to its content makes me understand how valid the social commentary was.",

The first thing that grabbed me was Humphrey Bogart. He did an excellent job portraying his character rick. Rick was a smooth, calm, collect kinda guy which set the mood. All of the actors/actresses contributed some very good acting too. The lighting was top notch and the music will stick in your head. The story which took place in the ww2 era, was very exciting to follow and did not let up once in grabbing your attention. The movie was full of dialog that I've heard in other films and TV shows but never knew it until I watched it. I recommend this movie to just about anyone with a heart and half a brain.

Although it is certainly a classic romance, the fact that such a serious even was occurring around it made it a lot darker than romantic movies commonly are. I thoroughly enjoyed the use of black and white in this film, as well. Arthur Edeson did a wonderful job making sure that the way this film was shot, really captured everything that was going on around them. Flashing back when Rick and Ilsa were together and madly in love, the tones were so much lighter than the present time heartbroken and troubled pair. When Rick is sitting alone in his café listening to Sam play ""their song,"" there isn't a single light directly on him.

As for real heartfelt film emotion, I will take the scene with the dueling anthems of Germany and France against any other. The scene captures the humanity of hope and pride. It is a symbol of the never say die attitude which would help to win the war (which in '42 was very much in question). The scene is among the greatest artistic achievements of the 20th century.",

I had huge expectations for this movie and after watching it I can see why it is such a widely loved movie. Set in the backdrop of World War 2, the story revolves around Rick who is the owner of a gin joint in Casablanca. The dialogs are what truly make this movie memorable as a number of them have become fixtures of popular culture. The acting is marvelous and Humphrey Bogart is exceptional as a man with a broken heart who is a sentimentalist.

851,29 June 2020,kennprop,9, Really quite good,"My wife wanted to watch this as she actually knew the man the character Rick was modeled on.His name was Danielski,he was Austrian. During WW2 he ran clubs in neutral Lisbon. The club's were frequented by all sides and he became a spy for the allies. Evidently ,because he was Austrian and spoke seven languages he was able to pick,up a lot of chatter info once people had had a few too many drinks. After the war he came to America and managed The Colony Club in Palm Beach for many years.My wife was friendly with his daughter during that time.He had married an English spy-OSS - journalist in Lisbon.
As to the movie ,I had seen it years ago and didn't really remember it. The performances by Bogie, Bergman, and Claude Rains are top notch. The supporting cast is very strong. The story is quite romantic and has some definite emotional moments.The special effects look ancient ,because they are. The dialogue is pretty quipy and the comedy is there at times. I think Claude Rains was huge in this movie.He's such a scoundrel,but he has those medals from WW1 too.""I am shocked, shocked to find out gambling is going on here. The dealer appears, To Rains,""Monsieur,your winnings. "" Rains, ""Thank you.!""
Bogart is the old stereotype of the good American and I wish our country was still seen that way today. Overall this movie is quite good. It is mainly a love story of course. Weakest performance is Strasser. He just isn't bad enuf.
Peter Lorie has a key bit part too. Many of these supporting folks were well known character actors in the factory movie system of that day. You see them in many,many movies.",

The first time I watched it I was somewhat confused by the story but after a few more viewings I fell in love with the movie and all the personalities. Rick is a character that exudes leadership and it shows by how much his staff at Rick's respect and love him so very much. They seem so genuine and that feeling of love rubs off on you and suddenly you find yourself loving and respecting Rick as well. It's these types of emotions that make this movie so powerful. The music is another element of the movie that stirs up your emotions from the scene at Rick's where Laszlo is singing of the Marselliase and Yvonne's 'Vive La France!...just so very inspiring.

It is an absolute classic of the noir era, due to how strong it is stylistically and has given us some of the most memorable lines and moments in film history. It can be easily interpreted as a propaganda film made to encourage the Americans to join the war. Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine is brilliant as the reluctant hero. The film itself has become iconic as a tale of redemption. Unlike Citizen Kane, it has withstood the test of time. In fact I would go further and say that Casablanca is timeless.",

Michael Curtiz never managed to become one of the greatest directors of all times. Visually, « Casablanca » is not at all very different from many of the other movies made during its era.

868,31 January 2003,ColeSear,7, Pure Entertainment (spoilers),"In Casablanca what is most noticeable is the way separate filmic elements join to create a whole. Under the supervision of Michael Curtiz all the necessary ingredients to make this film successful come together magically. I use the word successful because that's what the film is. It does what it sets out to do. It's fun to watch and not high art nor the most involving and deeply moving experience in film history but it works. 	 Curtiz's direction deserves to be mentioned first with all the ballyhoo and trumpet-tounged praise this film receives I had never known the name of the man who directed the film. In this film not only does he construct a very well-told visual narrative but he also provide some frames that floored me, most noticeably an establishing shot of The Blue parrot including an actual blue parrot, and the shadow used to establish La Belle Aurore. His insistence on his casting decisions also made the film what it is as a landmark in Hollywood history. Changing any one of the actors would likely have made the studio's prediction of it being a flop-come-true. 	 Humphrey Bogart could not have been better suited for his part. For through most of the film we see Rick Blain as cool and unflinching. Only in the flashback do we see his more emotional and less pragmatic side. Slowly we see revelations he helps the Humgarian girl he also quarrels with Ilsa over their failed love affair. Even in this film we find Bogart in his persona of the heroic loner which we would find in many of his films. 	 In what is probably the best piece of casting was Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa. Aesthetically Bergman has one of those faces that was just made to be filmed in black and white. She is luminous. She plays Ilsa to a tee and truly makes the love affair back drop of the film both during the flashback sequence and when she pleads in tears for Rick's assistance. In every film romance both actors have to be equals and suited for one another, this pair is. 	 The secondary players were also crucial. In such a way they can scarcely be called secondary characters. The most artistic part of Casablanca is that Curtiz both in the beginning and towards the end takes us amongst, little vignettes, snatches of the lives of the people who live their temporary existences in this town that's merely a gateway to Lisbon, then America. With the dual story of refugees and the love stories the secondary characters take on even greater importance. Claude Rains, when he's on the screen it's like there's no one else around. His excuse for closing down the café was the only dialogue that stuck in my head after so many years without having watched it. Rains plays his character in such a way that his change of heart at the end is justified and, as written, he is the most complex of all the characters. Peter Lorre, played Ugarte, he was absent through much of the film but Lorre with that voice always leaves an impression with the audience. He also seems to exude a kind of helplessness in this part. Syndey Greenstreet seemed to be the Fat Man out of The Maltese Falcon but in the end he helps his share of people and does a good job also. 	What made itself apparent to me this time as opposed to the first time I saw the film was the omnipresence of propaganda in Casablanca. Propaganda is often regarded as a four-letter word, and that's not always the case but it should always looked at with suspicion. In this film it's handled so intelligently and it's Positive-Propaganda, meaning that it's a call to action rather than a character assassination or anti-something. Rick is told ""Isolationism isn't a practical policy.' He's the only American character of the major figures this is a call to action for the American public to support the US war effort in Europe. The propaganda in this film is so incisive, intelligent and organic to the plot that it shows what a powerful medium film really is. It's interesting to note also that the film was made up of cast and crew mostly from Europe, director Micheal Curtiz, Peter Lorre and Paul Heinreid (Victor Laszlo) were born in the Austro-Hungarian empire, Igrid Bergman was Swedish, Claude Rains and Sydney Greenstreet were English and Colonel Srasser was played by a legend of German cinema Conrad Veidt. 	 What we have in Casablanca is film that can be enjoyed from any angle you look at it. It is a film that will transcend generations for years to come.",
869,13 August 2009,johnmschofield,10, A masterpiece for all times,This isn't a film I watch very often but when I do I always promise myself I will watch it more and in my case it never actually happens. I really do not know the reason other than maybe my approach to this film is that it is like visiting a relative who although I like lives many miles away. It will always be there unlike the relative though and that makes it even more special. This film grabs you very early but you need to pay attention because there are so many subtle facial changes of expression and body language movements that you can easily miss something. Like most of the great films it is timeless in that although it was made almost seventy years ago it can still captivate the viewer. It is a deceptively simple story but as always it gets complicated for all sorts of reasons. The film was of course made during the second world war but this has a series of emotional battle scenes and the whole experience is riveting and without doubt a masterpiece for all times.,
870,27 June 2014,Paddy-49,9, A serendipitous masterpiece,"Casablanca is a perfect artistic creation. It is a film which cannot be improved upon and one that, more than 70 years on, still has the power to surprise, amaze and entertain. It is not, and was never I think meant to be, realistic. By this I mean not just that it is not a true story but that it could never conceivably have been seen to be. The broad canvas of the city of Casablanca in the early years of the Second World War is authentic but the story which unfolds, the characters and the detail is of course fiction. This in no way negates the legitimacy of the movie which is far deeper than just telling a story would be. In this respect it is very akin to a painting or a sonnet. A painting is constrained by the two- dimensional static format and a sonnet by the rules of verse. But that doesn't mean that powerful messages cannot be conveyed. So it is with Casablanca. ",

The fact that is takes place in still-unoccupied France gives it a sense of danger, letting the viewer know people are going to Casablanca to get away from the war. The love story is amazing and classic, and this is coming from a guy that doesn't like romantic movies. Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa is beautiful in this movie, and it's not hard to see why Rick fell for her so hard. The music-especially a certain song-you know what I'm talking about-is still a classic. This is possibly Humphrey Bogart's most well-known role, and only a cynic couldn't see why. And the final reason, this movie has some of the most famous quotes in movie history.

For a long time it has been on my Movies To Watch list but I've just never had the opportunity or just never got around to it until now, and honestly though it was a good movie, I guess I was expecting more. When you hear about how great a movie is, you have high expectations and you expect those to be met, sadly, this film didn't meet those expectations. The film is a well shot film and the lighting is remarkable how it singles out characters or makes their face look just so, but the story is not necessarily what I expected. I fully expected a sappy romantic movie that you couldn't help but like because the characters were so genuinely in love. Definitely not a man who owns a saloon and is secretly pinning away for a girl that left him at a train station who then pops back into his life very much unannounced and undesired, especially because she is with another man. The story itself is not all bad, don't get me wrong, just not what I was expecting. Though the hero did not end like I would have wanted him to because of his selflessness, he does have a happy ending to a certain degree, and he certainly isn't all that alone in the end. Despite my expectations for the film, it is a rather good film and I would probably watch it again.",

I'll admit that I think it's a very good film with some very good performances and the romantic chemistry created by Bergman and Bogart is awesome, but being a massive Bergman Fan I've so far got 20 of her films and I wouldn't include Casablanca in her top 10. (Casablanca is in my opinion not as good as Gaslight, Notorious, Arch of Triumph, Under Capricorn, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, Goodbye Again, Indiscreet, Joan of Arc, Voyage to Italy, Cactus Flower, Anastasia).  There are some great moments like when Bergman tells Sam `play it, Sam' then Bogart walks in.  The Paris flash back. The Le Marseillaise bit and of course the ending.  Bad acting by some of the support actors is the only real downer. Out of 10 I'd give it 8.",

I can't add anything new to this movie because it's certainly one of the greatest classics to come out of Hollywood, but personally I like The Treasure of the Sierra Madre better in the Bogart canon. I know that many believe that Bogart was just an image and not a real actor, but I never believed in this theory. Sure, he's playing the tough guy again here, but the flashback sequence shows a different side of him, as do little moments between him and Claude Raines. Bergman is very good in her role, but I feel that she is the weakest character in the film. It's not that it's bad, but it seems to me that the supporting players are much better here. There is Raines, Peter Lorre, Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt, Sidney Greenstreet and, of course, Dooley Wilson.

The dark lighting and heavy shadows add a dramatic feel, while the use of close-ups help focus the viewers attention and get a better understanding of the thought and feeling behind the story.

Thats about all I understood until ricks little flashback scene to Paris. I enjoyed Rick's character and the character of the piano player but other than that I was not impressed. One thing this movie made clear is that they use to drink and smoke a lot. Just about every scene there doing both, constantly. The relationship between Rick and Ilsa Lund does get a little more interesting when you find out there history but in the end Rick doesn't end up with here so who care's? yeah he did the right thing because he knew she'd have a better life with Victor Laszlo but that just ruined the movie for me.

894,15 April 1999,bnm81510,10, A most enduring classic,"The only pre-MPAA rating system movie that holds its popularity and cult status from the very time it was released (even ""Gone With the Wind"" had a minor period of neglect), ""Casablanca"" is most people's primary association when they hear the word ""classic"". And rightly so: all aspects of the production have no glitches whatsoever. Plotwise, the film recounts the aftermath of a romance undermined by a disaster (in this case, a devastating war): a theme forever exploited for its box-office potential. Here, the three-hankie quotient is relatively low due to an intelligent script which concentrates on Europe's reaction to a near-apocalyptic threat to its way of life and its freedom of spirit. We also have some unforgettable musical moments (and an answer for why the Beatles used ""La Marselliase"" in ""All You Need Is Love""), the inspiration behind the Mos Eisley cantina in ""Star Wars"", the only representation of a black character up to that time that wasn't somehow demeaning, references which are widely speculated to be bisexual, and so much more! Some characters, one has to admit, are better developed than others (Bergman, who pimps herself back to Bogart in order to help the Resistance, is considerably more interesting elsewhere), but the writing is flawless and works of cinema and literature are still being named after the movie's lines of dialogue, one as recently as '95.

There's something deeply human and personal about the story of Rick and Ilsa, and though even the most cynical viewer may be skeptical at first, one glance at Ingrid Bergman's downy and soulful eyes will dispel any doubts. Everything about this film is pretty much perfect--the script is THE Hollywood script, it is tightly paced and brilliantly plotted. Overall, a true classic that withstands the test of time.

It was filmed in 1941-2, while Nazi Germany still had a FIRM grasp over Europe, the Allies were behind in many aspects in the conflict, and it shows in the film! The insecurity of the people watching this film at the time about how things were going to turn out is the most fascinating part of watching Casablanca! Think about it: When this film was being made and even during its release, people were wondering daily if Europe was going to remain in the hold of the facists, and if the Americas (North and South American Continents) were going to be the last part of the world left as ""free"" nations! Whenever one of my friends asks me about this movie when they see it on my movie shelf, that is what I tell them---and it makes them all the more interested in seeing it.

The acting was stale, the characters were un-relatable, and the story was drug out too long. I found myself bored throughout at least 80% of it.

The song ""As Times Goes By,"" became very well known I think because of Casablanca. Casablanca had such a cultural significance because it was filmed during World War II, there were many people who went to Bogart's restaurant for his help to get them out of Casablanca so that they could live, because the Nazi's were starting to invade it. Casablanca was a classic romance in which Ingrid tried to chose between to loves of her life but knows she can not stay in Casablanca or she will do, so Bogart tells her to leave in that famous scene at the end and risks getting killed himself for shooting one of the Nazis.

It is the epitome of great acting combined with great writing and then topped off with great direction. The subtleties throughout and the memorable lines are what make this movie. The little headnods to resent the German army to the final line are special. All through the movie the two leads, bogart and Bergman, bounce off each other radiantly with the likeable charisma necessary to a romance movie. Not to say they don't excel with the rest of the cast with some of the best moments.
Rick has one of the most powerful arcs in all of fiction instead of the usual romance ending, sacrificing that in the choice of the war, the other characters feeling and ultimately friendship.
Rick's character clearly has something up with him as he is so cynical throughout the first act and then ultimately the revelation of character comes through perfectly in a sort of 'of course' manor.
The world building in this is jaw dropping considering that about 90% takes place in a bar. Just from the embedded exposition we can understand the time, the magnitude of the war and all the moments happening around the bar.
Casablanca is a timeless movie, despite it's obvious dated cinematography and its square framing and grainy, because of the compelling narrative woven throughout keeping us on our toes and then the ending being a cinematically crafted masterpiece like the rest of the movie as the rising action, however what sets the final scene apart is how it is incapaulated story in itself.

I'm not a big Bogart fan under normal circumstances, but Ingrid Bergman is ethereal in everything she does. I'm so glad I finally sat down and watched it. This, along with Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" are perhaps the 2 best movies to come out of the early 40s. Such great dialogue in both movies, even without the action required in today's flicks to make up for a sh***y script, there's never a dull moment. If you've not seen Casablanca, you're doing yourself a disservice. Marvelous flick. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 out of 10 is because there are movies I like better. Not many, though, I assure you...Casablanca is a movie I would recommend to anyone.",

Not only is it not an exaggeration to call it the greatest movie in Hollywood history, it deserves revisiting--if for no other reason than to inventory the number of times dialogue, sets, plot, and characters have been ""borrowed"" in other movies over the last fifty years or so. Definitely deserves all the praise.",

The acting wasn't bad but I found it to be average of the time. The story wasn't bad either but was more extravagant than realistic. I'm bias against movies that take place in a foreign country though; for some reason I don't like them. Maybe I just don't understand different countries and different governments so I can't follow what goes on when I watch it in movies. But either way, I found it hard to relate to and just didn't enjoy watching it that much. I don't see it as one of the greatest movies of all time.",

I laughed out loud when I saw Casablanca listed #2 Greatest films of all time by the American Film Institute ( hey, how about Fight Club, American beauty, Mulholland Drive ? ). The story of Casablanca is simply straightforward, not witty or twisted ( oh, are all Hollywood films stupid so they call this one witty ??? ). The acting is fine, Ingrid Bergman is great but Humphrey Bogart looks damn boring like a sleepwalker ( or did he try to be cool? ). Ah, the only memorable quote to me in this film is ""The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world"". The others are forgettable and they may be classic because people consider this one a classic. ""Play it again, Sam"" for instance, what the hell? The line "" You jump I jump remember? "" in the blockbuster Titanic is even much better. The message? Very clear: love, sacrifice, anti-war propaganda. That's all. Not deep or complex at all. The only thing I like about this film is the song ""As time goes by"". It is excellent.",

Absolutely stunning direction, fabulous script, fantastic cast, and timeless love story of sacrifice to a greater cause. Bogart's Rick is possibly the best anti-hero in cinematic history (""I stick my neck out for no man!""). The quotes (and MIS-quotes) from this movie lend credit to its timeless appeal! From the first entrance into Rick's café (expertly done through the use of a moving camera) you are drawn into a world of intrigue, love, lust for power, desperation and hope that was North Africa in the WWII era. The black & white photography allows the director to create and use shadows to set mood and tension. The script moves along at a breakneck pace until the final scene when our hero's true colors are revealed. Let's face it. If you don't see this movie you'll regret it.

925,10 July 2006,hokiemo,9, First Rate in every way,"The film revolves around the lives of WWII refugees who use Casablanca as means of getting out of war torn Europe and into the United States. Humphrey Bogart is excellent as the cafe owner Rick and Ingrid Bergman superb as Ilsa, Rick's old lover who abandoned him in Paris without explanation, and then shows up in Casablanca with her husband. The script is well written and the dialogue flows effortlessly and believably between characters. Ingrid Bergman brings a fantastic amount of complexity to her character's emotions and the mystery surrounding her true feelings for Rick is smartly never fully resolved. Even when Ilsa claims she thought her husband was dead and that's why she had an romance with Rick, I'm not sure I believe her. Ilsa, whether its out of guilt or love, desperately wants to get her husband Victor Laszlo out of Casblanca and on his way to the USA. The Germans are trying to keep Laszlo in Casablanca indefinitely due to his anti-war activities. Claude Rains as Captain Renault is wonderful and leaves a indelible mark in cinema history for his witty retorts throughout the film.

Too many to list.  Or the continuously take-your-breath-away moment when Ingrid Bergman first appears on screen. Peter Lorre darting about deviously. Sydney Greenstreet, being despicable, as only he can. And Bogie...in my favorite of his performances.

I wonder why nobody's opened one in real life? Maybe they have, I will have to look that up. Anyway, the movie was great, cheesy in some parts (where they should be I guess), but great. It had big presence actors, evil to fight, a good looking woman, great atmosphere/sets, and unlikely twists. Shadows and lighting were masterfully done, especially with hat shadows across the face, and the sparkling of jewelry and eyes. I was also a big fan of the police chief who added a down to earth humor to the situation. Ooh, and I also learned why ""bogarting"" something meant being selfish.",
930,2 October 2012,ctimmons-492-149018,6, A good movie,"If you help someone that is in need not only will that person benefit from it, but you will too. Rick fell madly in love with a woman named Ilsa. Ilsa broke Ricks' heart which made Rick change. When Rick arrived at Casablanca, he bought a bar and in almost every scene, he was drinking. The way I saw it was he was trying to drink his sorrows away. Rick mainly cared about himself and he said that he does not stick his neck out for anyone and he would not help anyone out if he would get in trouble for doing so. Rick would also not get close to anyone probably for fear of getting hurt again. Rick did not socialize with others unless it was business. When people in the bar would ask to have a drink with him, they were told no because Rick did not drink with anyone. However, that changed when Ilsa arrived and she asked to have a drink with him, he sat down and had a drink with Ilsa and her husband. When Ilsa came to his bar, Rick started breaking all of his rules. Rick stuck his neck out even when there was a great danger of him getting trouble and he was getting close to Ilsa again. The writing of this story shows that one person can change the way someone thinks, feels, and acts. This is a good example of a love story. Two men were madly in love with a women and one man had to let the women go because he thought it would be the right thing to do. At the end of the movie, the man let her go because he wanted her to be happy, even if it was not with him. If I were to write a love story, I would use this movie as an example because it shows that you can love someone and risk your life for them and they are with someone else. Rick was given a very valuable object at the beginning of the movie and that was some letters. The letters were very valuable and Ilsa wanted them. Ilsa wanted the papers for several reasons. First, they meant freedom from the Nazis and from Casablanca because the letters meant they could get enough money to leave to make it to America. Second, they meant mobility because they were worth enough money for Ilsa and her husband to get on the plane to leave Casablanca. Lastly, the meant a new life in America because they were able to get on the plane to leave. In a way, Rick was like the Nazis. The Nazis were very powerful people and Rick was a powerful man. The French police told Rick that Islas' husband, Lazlo, was not allowed to leave Casablanca and whoever helped him escape would be in a lot of trouble. Rick had power because he had the papers that Ilsa and her husband needed to leave Casablanca. The Nazis sent Lazlo to a concentration camp where he was not able to leave and Rick had the power to make Lazlo not leave Casablanca.",

The main character is an American who has chosen to start up a club in the city of Casablanca. Humphrey Bogart plays Rich, the American as he is split between choosing the love of his life or saving her and her husband who is a resistance fighter against the Nazi's. The movie was a little controversial because it was released to the general public after the attack on Pearl Harbor and after we entered the war against the axis powers; but before we knew that we were going to win the war.This is reflected in the movie and shows our hopefulness as by the end of the film Rich chooses to step up and fight against the Nazi's as he once did before opening his club.",

The movie has a peculiar magic to it, and it's in the richness of its details that the viewer finds them self engrossed. The director's use of foreshadowing makes those aha moments that come later on in the film even more exhilarating, and allow one to wonder if these events are happening within a 24 hour time frame.

946,22 July 2004,naim81,10, Casablanca isn't Casablanca without Humphrey and Ingrid!,"Casablanca, starring the cool Humphrey Bogart and the angelic Ingrid Bergman is more than just a movie. It is a landmark film, transcends deep into American culture, and become the most popular motion picture of all the worlds of all the times. What makes Casablanca so popular? I can't explain it, so does everybody I supposed. I sincerely don't think that the pairing of Bogart and Bergman made them the best of all time. Bogart is better with his real life partner, and Bergman is far better with Cary Grant, her match in terms of good-looks and sexual tension. Nevertheless, Rick is Bogart's best role, the role really suited him. Bogart typically played smart, playful, courageous, tough, occasionally reckless characters who lived in a corrupt world, anchored by a hidden moral code. Rick seemed as cool as cucumber, but didn't dare to hear somebody played 'As Time Goes By'. Other than Casablanca, his best films are The Maltese Falcon and The Treasure of Sierra Madre. If you want to appreciate good acting, Bogart's Rick is the first to start. Ilsa is hardly Bergman's best role. She's more convincing as a tortured wife in Gaslight or an alcoholic woman in Hitchcock's Notorious. But when the most beautiful woman in the history of films played the role of Ilsa, Ilsa too had become the most beautiful female character in the history of cinema. I can't remember seeing a face more beautiful than hers; she is breathtaking, illuminating every scene. To watch Casablanca is to fall in love with Ingrid Bergman. Both Bogart and Bergman wanted to quit during filming, because they thought the story was ridiculous and unbelievable. Bergman was more critical, she hoped that nobody will ever screened Casablanca again after she died. The whole production was a chaos; nobody thought that they were making the best film of the 20th century. Bogart having problems with his third marriage, Bergman worried about her future role in her next film, the producers didn't know the ending yet and so on. For those who might think of remaking Casablanca, just forget it. For the greats Bogart and Bergman have long been dead, and for Casablanca isn't Casablanca without the two of them.",
947,24 October 2015,animism-36544,3, Painful to Get Through,"I'm sad to say it, but I found this film to be extremely boring. In my opinion, it dragged on. It did it's job in making you dislike the oppressive Nazi soldiers, and making you want Rick and Ilsa together; but as for holding my attention, it didn't do so. Watching Rick develop as a character was nice to see, as he was very monotone in the beginning and his feelings came up more and more by the end. The best part was the very end, where Rick shoots the German soldier and Renault lets him get away with it. The scene was put together smoothly and really made you like the characters.Another good compilation of scenes were the flashbacks between Rick and Ilsa. Rick's personality was completely different from that of the present. When he was stood up, it made you feel bad and then completely understand his cool composure through he rest of the film.

954,4 December 2020,shamanhector,10, the perfect model of classic design narrative,"Its no secret that Casablanca is a great film.its a near perfect movie in every aspect. Passing through all those reasons though, its core is how authentic it is concerning the classic design model of narrative and how it uses that devotion to a tight plot in its advantage.in spite of that its not at all standard.But how so?Well ,it puts in the bin many elements that would later become the standard but somehow never a given.First of all plot and themes go along fro the start.The motives that make the characters act are very clear no matter how complicated or simple they are.They are not a mystery as it is the case with many films nowadays.In that way it achieves real substance,which of course is combined with impeccable style.
The dialogue is very discreet and full of subtext.That way the film spices up and it becomes more clever than most films today.All the lines seem really suited to the characters and thus organic.
Acting is of course top notch and very ahead of it time.Bogey gives Rick a poetry between the lines just with his eyes.He really keeps the balance between the suave and confident guy and the beaten dissapointed in romanticism man.The way he performs is not typical of that era its more suited to the the realism of the seventees.Ingrid is perfect in playin a beautiful but very deep young woman.She really does justice to this great,conflicted character who wants who of course has the beliefs of a mature individual.She doesnt just seat around thinking about the way to make the world better,she acts on it.At the same time she is very conflicted about her feelings.Ilsa is one of the first truly strong but real female characters to come out of hollywood.As far as the other actors are concerned they all give great supportive performances from Petter Lorre to claude rains and Dooley Wilson as Sam.
Now that i have fineshed talking about the obvious greatness of the movie i wanna adress the thing that struck me the most in my last viewing of the film.All that devotion to the classical model and the clear application of the structure on the tree act model allows the movie to flirt with some elements that transcend it.The cinematography for instance is very similar to noir fimls which adds an extra layer to the film.That element progresses the themes in the sense that it compliments the characters at any given moment.That being said the story doesnt have many of the usual tropes of noir film but it really makes it more complex.The flashback sequence is anther thing which is less convential than usual.Flashnacks dont always work but in this instance its really reavealing and it comes in the right moment.Its a film that crosses genres and with the very unique and iconic elements such as the ending or the screenplay overall for that matter it deserves a place in the hall of fame of masterpieces.
In this review i wanted to avoid literary language because i wanted to talk about the things that really hit me in this last viewing i had the other day.The gist of what i talked about is that its a film that really made an impact because its not typical in its conservative narrative.In other words ,although its a perfect example of the strengths of the classical model it turns around or it uses many elements that a true piece of art.",

Yvonne, a minor character who is hurt by Rick emotionally, falls into the company of a German soldier. In a land occupied by the Germans, but populated by the French, this is an unforgivable sin. She comes into the bar desperately seeking happiness in the club's wine, song, and gambling. Later, as the Germans begin singing we catch a glimpse of Yvonne sitting dejectedly at a table alone and in this brief glimpse, it is conveyed that she has discovered that this is not her path to fulfillment and she has no idea where to go from there. As the singing progresses, we see Yvonne slowly become inspired by Lazlo's act of defiance and by the end of the song, tears streaming down her face, she is singing at the top of her voice too. She has found her redemption. She has found something that will make her life never the same again from that point on.",

The storyline in so complex but is conveyed in such a simple form. Bogarts character is so round that his emotions and character development is what makes this movie so complex but exhilarating. He starts off being carefree, doesn't care for anyone, Shows no concern towards death or the war and hates just about everyone. He's a true gambler. He's just a bar owner who only cares for himself. But then when he finds his true love the story twists to an entire new perspective and Bogart develops character, just something you have to see. Another exceptional feature to this film is the lighting, some of the darkest scenes are lit so appropriately. I also really enjoyed the mood that was conveyed in Casablanca, it was really fun to watch. Good photography, exceptional acting and a very developed story with twists and turns all over. Very good movie.",

He does not want to be attached to anything personally or politically, but he has receive hold of two transit letters. Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), who is a Czech nationalist writer and his wife, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) has come to Rick's in search of exit visas because on their way to America, they must arrive at Casablanca first, and visas are hard to come by. Surprisingly, Rick and Ilsa were former lovers who met in Paris, and Ilsa was also the only woman Rick has ever loved. Their relationship ended when Rick flees the city from German armies and the plan was that they leave together. When Ilsa did not come to the train station, Rick left without Ilsa and hasn't seen her since.

Beside the obvious charisma and passion of the leading actors, Bogart and Bergman, it is also a glorious tale about the human condition. It is a tale about idealism, and idealism gone stale. It is a tale of greed, fear, resignation, smugness, indifference, and re-birth.

The picture was clear and the camera movement was steady. Also the acting was amazing, I especially enjoyed the most of the characters, I did like Humphrey which I guess a lot of people didn't.

How dare they are, with the world crumbling, they pick to fall in love. there is war out there, there is pain, sorrow, hopelessness.but surrounded by death and fear, they decide to set their hearts free, to enjoy their very life no matter how much overwhelming. In any category sorted by anyone, Casablanca definitely is included as one of the classics. Its genre is combination of war, romance and drama, and that is exactly what makes it so delightful. Humphrey Bogart (Rick) undoubtedly was one of the finest actors of all time and unanimously speaking, Casablanca is his best. Rick is an excellent epitome of a guy who gets tough and tougher without loosing tender. His former love leaves him high and dry in a train station in Paris and after countless restless nights of pining and sorrow he has moved on and began to run a night club in north of Africa. He is a prominent man in the town ,witty, arrogant, disdainful, clever and showing no interest for politics in spite of his former records .but deep down inside he is so heart-tender ,one of a kind lover and caring about people's lives. Then, one they out of blue, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) , his ex, walks into the bar, with her husband, demanding Sam(piano player) to play ""as time goes by"", and what is more instigating than a piece of music that reminds you of a sacred memory?! Greater the love, greater the tragedy when it's over In this movie there exist two distinguished epic scenes that emotionally for sure will change your heart beats. Once approximately in the middle of the movie there was a scene aka as 'The Battle of the Anthems' in which a group of German soldiers had come into Rick's cafe and were intoxicatingly singing the German National anthem loudly. Victor Lazlo(Ilsa's husband), the leader of the French Resistance, cannot stand this act and while the rest of the club stared reluctantly with fear at the Germans, ordered the band to play the French National Anthem, accompanied by a confirming nod from Rick, the band begins playing, with Victor singing at the top of his voice as a pioneer. This inspires the whole club to begin singing along and the Germans are forced to surrender and sit down at their table, humbled by the crowd's dedication. In my book, this was the most appealing part of the movie.",

Even while shooting it, changes were being made - the famous ending where Claude Rains and Humphrey Bogart walk off into the fog was not in the original script. (TV's The Simpsons even featured an alternative ending in one of their shows!) The plot involves wartime refugees gathering in Morocco hoping to obtain scarce exit visas to Lisbon.

The main character(played by Humphrey Bogart) is faced with a major dilemma. HE can either run off with the girl whom he has feelings for or he can let her go and potentially help fight the good fight. The movie was released around the time of world war 2 so there is a strong military presence during the whole thing. The dialogue and screenplay are remarkable adding to the power of the story. An example of that is Ingrid Bergman. Her performance dealing with her characters emotions were right on spot. Overall The characters made the movie a classic.,

The same can be said when we first are shown Rick's club, the amount of contrast and so many things moving at once (and bright) in one shot. There is a scene when the police chief is talking to Rick while Rick is out of the shot. Rick's shadow is seen clearly against the wall and it appears as if the chief is talking directly to Rick's shadow. A good visual effect. In the scene when Rick is drinking and sulking in the middle of the night, the lighting (or lack of) and shadows totally set the depressing mood for that scene. The protagonists are mostly seen wearing brighter/lighter colored clothing. I like that the social message of the film was one of anti-Nazisentiment, especially because at the time of the film's release the war had not been won yet. The dialog was witty and fast paced.

The plot is perfectly crafted, with a love triangle intersecting with the crushing pressures of wartime, and it is beautifully told by director Michael Curtitz, with flashbacks, a few surprises and not a single wasted shot. Most importantly, the film conveys a sense of those huge moments in life that we will always remember when everything in a person's life turns around, as well as the pain of lost love. Bogart holds a note in the rain, the ink begins to drip as he is persuaded to get on the train, and later he watches the plane disappear into the fog, the signal light dwindling to a pinprick, and both moments are incredibly poignant.",

With a plot that is apparently simple yet delves into universal themes that are still true today, a series of wonderful characters, some joyous and witty dialogue, a nostalgic score and a great melancholic setting, Casablanca is rightly regarded as one of the treasures of this art. Watch this film as much as you can and you will realise that it achieves what is only in the reach of great movies: it improves with time, uplifting you, purging you, and giving you a taste of what people call, the ""magic of cinema."" The film uses World War II as a device to set two lovers' personal tragedy against the greater larger tragedy that was the war. We have Rick (Humphrey Bogart), a charismatic, cold, hard hearted bar owner who sticks his neck out for nobody and who is going by his duties until one night, his wounds are re-opened with the arrival of Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). In a series of flashbacks that have always seemed poignant to me, we learn that Rick and Ilsa were once lovers in Paris. Well, that was what Rick thought until the entrance of the Nazi regime in Paris when he was suddenly abandoned by her without any precise explanation. Seeing her in Casablanca accompanied by her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) after all those years since Paris brings back those memories he tried so hard to avoid confronting. Why Casablanca, why ""of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she had to walk into mine?"" Being hunted by this question is what avoids Rick handing Ilsa and her husband the letters of transit - letters Victor needs to flee the grasp of the Nazi in Casablanca so that he can carry on his fight against this evil.",

Casablanca is the ultimate classic, and that's a fact. From its memorable and ever-repeated quotes to Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, all the way through its music (the enduring As Time Goes By), the postcard scenes and the mix between a drama about the always attractive Nazi subject and occasional ironic jokes. How could we ever forget the scene in the airport, ""Play it, Sam"", ""Here's looking at you, kid"", ""We'll always have Paris"", ""Round up all the usual suspects"" and ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship""? We never will, not only because of what they represent, but because we'll keep on hearing them and watching them in every movie, TV show, book and every single artistic expression. Casablanca marked a before and after in art history and opened a whole new theme in it. In fact, every Hollywood movie we watch has some element of Casablanca, and it will always be like that. Every movie heroine is, in some way, Ilsa, and every movie hero has something of Rick in him, as well as every movie love story has something of theirs. But all this doesn't mean at all that this is a cliché, and that's because this one started it all. Casablanca will endure in time and will always be in our hearts and memories. That's why it's a classic. It is where it all started. I'm sixteen years old, I absolutely LOVE this movie, I cry every time I watch it. This movie is for all audiences.",

Casablanca is a real classic. It's the sort of movie that feels like an experience and makes you glad you've seen it. It was all so excellent that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who loves movies. When you see some of these scenes for yourself you immediately understand how they've had such a lasting influence to this day. For the leading characters, their relationship meant hope, which was exactly what was needed throughout the bleak time that was World War II.

This may be the beginning of a great friendship. The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this world. Play it Sam, play As Time Goes By. The evil German's are perfectly evil. The dueling national anthems are timeless. The corrupt French Captain is perfect in a corrupt nether world like war time Casablanca. The relationship between a young star struck Elsa in learning to love her underground hero husband. her pain at learning of his death. Her finding love in a new man - Bogey. And her distress at learning her husband was still alive and needed her. It all made up for the pain felt by Bogey at being left in the rain at the train station with her dear John letter dripping away.

It's interesting to watch how everyone gravitates towards the character with a strong sense of independence. The characters are what really make the film.

On my second time watching the film, I picked up many subtly elements that truly improved the overall feel of the film that I did not see when I watched the film many years ago. The dialog that the characters use is also very realistic to the time period so is not necessarily easily understood by viewers from this century. The characters also speak very fast and can be quite often hard to understand. Despite these few caveats, Casablanca ultimately does not disappoint.

The dialog in this film blows so many modern films out of the water, being at the same time witty, in some cases laugh out loud funny, and powerful. It's amazing how many of its iconic lines have become permanently engraved in film history. This is only the third film I've seen of Bogart's but he continues to impress each time.

I was not particularly fond of the topic, mainly because I at first did not see much conflict in the movie, but I understood it further as I went on. I did admire some of the shadow work throughout the film and Humphrey Bogart gave a great performance.

It's easy to see what a strong and obvious influence this movie had on Spielberg(particularly Indiana Jones(ma boi)). Bogey is deh nuts in this film.

The films writing and allegorical themes are strong, with Bogart's performance leading the way. Beautifully shot, the film delivers strong meaning visually, utilizing such shots as when the camera tilts down from the slogan of the French revolution as the usual suspects are rounded up, or when Captain Renault discards the Vichy French water bottle. The characters are nicely and methodically developed over the course of the movie, and the acting reinforces this. The strongest aspect in my opinion was the writing, which skillfully provided thematic aspects like Rick's allegorical isolationist policies, clever comedic situations, and moving romance.",

I assumed that it was just going to be a slow, straight forward love story set in an exotic place. However, I was completely wrong. The movie has a really meaningful story, and a super exciting, fast-paced plot. The love story you see take place in the film is already half over when the film starts. I thought that we were going to be able to see the two characters meet and fall in love, however they had already met and are already in love from the beginning of the film. Having the characters already share history and having their history revealed to us over time is a really gripping and impacting way to tell a story.

1016,19 February 2022,rvinson-95139,2, Vastly overrated,"It should be obvious that the only reason this movie is so highly rated is that it appeals to religious or left-wing sensibilities that admire people sacrificing for the ""common good"". Personally, if the Ingrid Bergman character was truly unhappy with her husband, then she should have left him for Bogart, but no, she has to commit to duty, to sacrifice, particularly in time of great distress. Much like ""Citizen Kane"", that's all this movie has to offer - a stale moral that we should not seek personal gain or happiness, if it potentially ""harms"" others; sacrifice is the order of the day. The Bergman character should stick with her dull marriage, so to please her husband in a time of war, and Charles Foster Kane should have given up his lofty position and go back to his simple, boyish days of sledding. He would have been a happier man for it and not alienated so many people. Other than this tired, old moral of the importance of sacrifice or resignation, both these films are snooze fests and not deserving of classic status.",
1017,10 May 2011,E-reilly3,9, Great classic movie,The cinematography in this movie is unparalleled. The dark lighting and heavy shadows create that classic film noir feeling that gives this movie the dramatic effect. One thing that I really liked is that there are a lot of close up and medium close ups that really focus the viewers attention on who is speaking and allow us to concentrate on the story. A very creative aspect to the movie is how we don't find out the story between Rick and Ilsa all at once. Flashbacks and the use of the character Sam allow us to slowly figure out the situation between the two. The dramatic twist at the end comes as an unexpected but valiant move and shows Rick to be the character that we didn't quite see him as throughout the rest of the movie.,

I thought the setting of the restaurant ""Casablanca"" was really pretty and I felt like I would want to go to that place. It had a really elegant feel to it with a little upbeat twist.

Its absence of flaws and abundance of excelences makes this movie irrisitably good. The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman only adds to this films excellence.  Also, the comedic relief in a somewhat dark plot from Claude Rains and Peter Lorre never fails to amaze me.  Many people say that Citizen Kane is a better movie, but that film, although excellent, does not have the quality that Casablanca does.  What I mean by that is most people know numerous lines and scenes from Casablanca(some who haven't even seen the movie) and I frequently hear it quoted n everyday conversation.  I cannot say the same for Citizen Kane. The combination of these elements makes the perfect formula for the greatest movie ever made, CASABLANCA!!!!",

I mean before I didn't think I would like it at all, but I know it's revolutionised cinema, and I can now see exactly why. I watched this film in my Film Studies Lecture at Kingston University with about 200 other people. I haven't seen many films that are that old, but I now appreciate that these films were for another generation, and used all the technology available at the time to it's fullest, and if it wouldn't of been for these films, we wouldn't see the sort of films we love today. I thought Humphrey Bogart was extremely good in this film - he came across as a very cool character, and by the end I wanted to emulate his unforgettable lines such as: 'Here's Looking At You Kid', and of course the very final line in the film. This film also teaches many valuable lessons, that all of us can learn from. Finally, I recommend this film to everyone because of the epic values it portrays.

The love story seemed kind of cheesy; although, I did really enjoy the main character and who he represented throughout the film. Humphrey Bogart, Richard, represented the Americans throughout the war, which represented isolationism. Richard shows isolation in the film by never drinking with anyone. My favorite line throughout the movie was ""I'll stick my neck out for nobody"" and then the General replied with ""Ah, a wise foreign policy."" I think that was totally great. Another great aspect of the movie was the lighting. I think it was great when the light reflected off the sides of their faces and off the tops and brims of their hats. Overall the movie wasn't that bad, but I was expecting something way more complex than it actually was.",

The rest of the costumes for the movie were well done also. I loved how Humphrey Bogart was always looking as classy as possible with his suits and bow-tie. The music was very cool in this film as well, especially the character Sam who played for Rick in the saloon. He was really talented.

Where the movie really shined was in it's camera work, the shots, angles, and lighting were fantastic.

Director Michael Curtiz did essentially everything perfect. The plot, lighting, sounds, and even the political message was clear and well done. Humphrey Bogart (Rick Blaine) did a great job playing a character who is quite powerful and doesn't like to get involved in other peoples affairs. What makes this film so significant is the political message at the time. At this point in history, America attempted to stay out of the affairs of other countries of the world. Rick Blaine represents America in this film. As time went on and the war started to become a threat to our everyday lives, America became involved. As the story of Casablanca goes on, Rick becomes more involved as well. What I also enjoyed about this film is that while so many different things are going on, a simple love story is unwinding and it is quite a good one. Overall, this is one of the best films of that era and would recommend to anyone.",

His artful dissection of the film--the centerpiece of his presentation--served only to increase my admiration for its many levels of significance. Its narrative design, its psychological subtlety, and its effectiveness as propaganda early in World War II make this a film that offers new insights with each new viewing. Like great literature, its richness remains superlative but never superfluous, and its economy of expression articulate, not taciturn. When I occasionally teach scenes from the film in theater and literature classes, students often note how even very minor characters with only a few lines achieve a presence that exceeds their roles. For many of my students, ""Casablanca"" becomes the beginning of a ""beautiful friendship"" with their own capacities for appreciating the kind of artistic integrity it embodies.",

Already have been told major things to pay attention to, already have been told memorable parts of the film such as the French National Anthem being played, allowed me to appreciate the film in a more personal way. The love story between Rick and Ilsa was loving, sad, surprising and memorable all wrapped into a nice little bundle. There are indeed some great moments such as the piano playing, the incredible lighting techniques, and even the message of the war time world. Rick, the owner of a bar in Morocco and the main man in the film, is reunited with a former love, Ilsa. You can sense the tension between the two because of Ilsa's new man, and the hurt Rick feels from their days spent together in Paris (which is expressed through his alcohol consumption and late nights after hours at the bar). Though bitter, he still manages to get her, and her boyfriend, to America to ensure their safety from the dangerous Morocco. The story and plot are fantastic, and the wartime message to beat the Nazi's is extremely powerful, and the new lighting/shadows techniques was second-to-none for its time.

1042,25 April 2016,CriticalViewing,8, To be or not to be,"This film caught the nation's attention mid war, it showed Rick, the isolationist, and the woman that would come back into his life, Elsa, that would be the strong enough to prompt him to reconsider his decision and stance on the war. As an isolationist, he refused to get involved, even in the beginning when someone he was familiar with got arrested in his establishment, right in front of him. Even as the man was gripping Rick's shirt pleading for his assistance, Rick remained nonchalant about the whole matter. And when someone else he was familiar and friendly with saw his lack of involvement and said, ""When they come to get me Rick I hope you'll be more of a help"", to which Rick calmly and nonchalantly says, ""I stick my neck out for nobody"", walks away, and goes back to work. But when a blast from the past comes back into his life, Rick is flooded with emotion. First with a piano piece Elsa asks the piano player to play, has Rick storming out of a back room heatedly saying ""I thought I told you to never play that song"". At which point the player points to Elsa, and from then, a switch is flipped within Rick. The use of heavy shadow or lack of it tells the story almost as much as the words of this timely significant film does. The crime for which Rick was pleaded to aid in exempting the man from political consequence, the crime is to be committed by someone very, very close to Rick's heart. This film follows the change (or lack of) in Rick's mind through use of flashback and the course of action he takes in the film to get to the ultimate end of this film in which the ever changing analytical side of Rick becomes set, in which his motives are brought to light, and is 100% decisive in his ultimate decisions. This film was so extremely culturally significant as there were many Rick's in the world, many Americans in the USA and elsewhere making the decision to distance themselves and be thoroughly uninvolved in the events of war; not even wanting to hear about it and those who were very patriotic, fighting and aiding the war effort. This movie explores that in a very realistic way, and on the surface, a very straightforward way, but more in depth, had an all too common complexity that made it very relatable to its audience.",

One scene in particular stands out, in which a number of drunken German officers are singing a German anthem very loudly. People just stand and watch them, not daring to anything about it, but obviously not pleased. Then Victor Laszlo decides that he has had enough of this, and instructs the band to play Les Marseilles (please excuse my probably incorrect spelling), the French anthem. After a nod from Rick, the band starts up, and Victor begins singing it at the top of his voice. All the rest of the café joins in, and it swells to such a noise, that the Germans can no longer be heard, and they promptly sit down, looking angry.

Since this way it is Casablanca, which happened was the better of our life, but the time happens and everything ends.
"" Always we will still have Paris "" says to him Rick (H. Bogart) to Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) this when it is going to divide towards America. A Paris that stays as this recollection that they have not forgotten throughout the years, a Paris that retains the love that was had and that there remained. Difficult what is ... truth? During the existence of the human this being it limits itself to promising things that in occasions it cannot fulfill, falls in love, looks for a reason by which to remain entertained until the sad end, that end that comes to all without differentiating any alive being of this planet, the death. "" Since the time happens "" he says the song that there touches Sam (D. Wilson) for Ilsa, it forms a of seeing that the facts of the present will transform in recollections of the future and when the death finally comes, it will be the recollection of us themselves what it will remain.
The presence on screen of H. Bogart is indisputable, becomes big in chamber and his action performs the better thing that transmits great classic this one, there is no way of resisting turn fascinated by his interpretation. His place is cozy and important in the plot. In fact, in this place it is where a scene takes place praises of great meaning. The German officials sing a military march and other clients of the bar remain quiet, listening until Lazslo (P. Henreid) sees what happens. It is admirable as Víctor, in this moment of supremacy Nazi, decides to intone the Of Marseilles one and the whole bar joins him, silencing to the German voices.

I noticed that the face of Bergman seemed almost perfect through the use of lighting as well. Rick was definitely the protagonist in the movie, but he was not a hero at all. He was mostly concerned about his own well-being throughout the entire movie. The antagonist in the movie was the Nazis. I enjoyed the fact that the movie touched on the fact that the Nazis were human beings as well. It showed the weaknesses that they have. I don't think I have ever seen a film in which the Nazis are portrayed in this way. I also noticed that there was a lot of sound in this movie.

He had a lot of techniques involved in it. He used a tilt shot, showing the plane in the sky then the camera was tilted to show the men and women watching the sky. I thought it was a nice move, it was missing any pieces there because it was a nice clean shot. They use low key lighting, were the shadows were almost over emphasized. The women were highlighted and shown in a beautiful way, especially Isla. They also made sure she didn't have too many harsh shadows on her face. They had the perfect tonal range in the light, that helped show the emotions of the characters the best. The director had used a lot of minor characters , which confused me a bit. I was confused between Rick and Victor, I found that there was not much a strong difference between the two of them that really stood out to me.The cinematographer always used the best techniques to show of the characters, in the beginning showing off Sam in the restaurant they start off at a far distance, but then gradually zoom in almost as if it is a slow motion shot of Sam singing and playing the piano.",

And how romantic is Ingrid Bergman's remark in Paris: ""Are those the bombs or is it my heart beating?"". I believe the feelings of a woman in love are so wonderfully said in one sentence. Repeating all those statements will be boring here. The high voters will know them all.

I can't imagine what seeing this movie would be like at the time not knowing the outcome of the war. The back story alone is exciting. The movie itself was also entertaining. The use of shadow and what seemed like dim lighting really added to the tension and drama of the plot. I also appreciated the use of flashback in the film which was not common at the time. Everything about this movie was great for capturing the attention of the audience. The character development was great since there was a history between the two and the emotion was conveyed strongly in the eyes of each character when the light would shimmer off their tears. This allowed the viewers To almost feel the pain and love felt by the characters.,

Luckily, Bogart's performance gives me something to talk about because, as always, his acting is captivating. Without he and Bergman this film would fall flat. The romance is pretty cheesy and formulaic. Plug in any attractive blonde and she could play Ilsa and any big brute of a man could play Laszlo. Hell, the fact that Peter Lorre's character was more interesting than Laszlo speaks volumes to the nature of this film. It's a good movie without a doubt but i just don't get the common tag of greatest film of all time. The only thing really stopping me from giving this movie lower than a 7 is Bogart.

The love story definitely adds to the effect and serves as a distraction from the overall message. The use of light in this movie adds to the way it is perceived. In many of the dramatic scenes, the entire room is dark except for a light that shines perfectly on the face of the actor in frame.

The rough but alluring voice of Bogart, the sparkling eyes of Ingrid Bergman and the churlish charm of Renault, catapult this film into a territory of eternal classics. The theme of sacrifice runs throughout the film and it adds a nobility in an otherwise miserable circumstance. Nevertheless, the character of Louis, despite the amazing acting skills of the actor, gives me the creep. Especially when he is to be a lovable rogue but in actuality is a pimp in uniform taking advantage of female refugees. Still it is a beautiful film with characters that are smartly dressed and also own wonderful coterie of hats!",

Humphrey Bogart who plays Rick, a club owner, finds himself in Casablanca due to mysterious reasons which were never really told. Ingrid Bergman plays an old girlfriend named Ilsa that accidentally stumbles back into Rick's life in Casablanca. This film does a great job in slowly developing the backstory that explains why Rick and Ilsa were no longer together. The story written by Julius Epstein, and directed by Michael Curtiz, weaves its way through multiple scenarios and possibilities for the characters to take. It is not until the very end that you truly know how Rick is going to handle the tricky situation he finds himself in. I thought this was a great film for the early 40s and it still holds up today.",

With a plot like this it can really suck you into this story and really see how these characters interact with each and the world around them. The World War ll setting really gives this sense of urgency, that places our main characters on a time limit and they must figure out what they are going to do very quickly. And as someone who likes history I can really appreciate the World War ll setting and this movie, even though I am not a big fan of the romance aspect.

I believe the overall message of this film was that you should do what is best for those you love even if you don't want to. Sometimes you have to be selfless. Since it was set in December of 1941 when Pearl Harbor was happening another over all message to the film was that America needs to join the war. This movie was such a similitude- I really believed in the movie and the characters. I felt the movie was heartfelt and certain parts I really felt like I could feel the characters feelings. The sound was wonderful. The scene where the plane was taking off in the beginning was great. As the plane rose over them on the porch you could hear the engine steady, the roar the higher the plane went. The protagonist in this film was Bogart. He was also the main character, you just felt him. Felt his pain, his sorrow, his love, and throughout the whole film the view was on his side. I noticed there was a lot of layering with the camera and the back round scenes. Some were very good and detailed and others you could tell the background was just a back drop that they altered in some way or another. This was a captivating movie. I believe the beautiful lighting had a lot to do with that. There were many parts in this film where there was low key lighting. Very few high key lighting scenes, but the low key made the movie that much more believable. I noticed, and i may be wring, but the only spots where there was a lot of high key lighting was when the theme song played. The lead woman in the film had very distinct lighting throughout the film. It was background lighting to soften her face. Over all I thought this was a good movie. It was quick paced, kept the viewer involved and interested in the film and the characters.",

I thought the story line drag a little in some parts, and I may stand alone in that however the visuals I think made up for my lack in interest. This movie was shot in black and white and I don't think it could have been better in any other way, the black and white added glamor and beauty to a lot of the scenes. Also the lighting was key in this movie, a lot of the lighting was soft lighting especially when Ingrid Bergman was the focus of the frame. The image had a soft filter and it gave Bergman this innocent and glow. Using the soft lighting in this movie also added to the romantic mood of a lot of the scenes. The use of shadows was also very apparent in this movie. One scene that used low key lighting was when Bergman is up in Humphrey Bogarts room hiding, the lights are off and she has a large shadow casting across her, this use of shadow gives us the tone of the scene, and really insist that she must stay hidden in the shadows. Casablanca also uses high key and hard lighting in the film to create crisp and clear pictures as well. Soft and hard lighting will even be used in the same scene. An example of this being used is in the ending scene when Bogart is saying goodbye to Bergman's character. The camera will do a close up of Bogarts face and it will be in hard lighting, the image is very clear and crisp of his face, we can see every wrinkle under his eyes and such, however when the shot switches to a close up of Bergman's face we see her in a soft lighting like I have mentioned before. This make her look young and glowy. The contrast is very apparent and really sets the two characters apart.

It has romance (and that's always a good thing) and it may even teach it's viewers a little something about history that they might not already know.  One of the only problems with the movie is that it's slow moving.  It's a lot of talk and no action.  Movies don't have to be all about blowing things up and killing people to be good, but `Casablanca' involved maybe a little bit too much talking, at least at one time.  At one point in the movie one of the main characters was talking for so long that this reviewer found herself starting to drift off.

But when it was on TV, I felt compelled to, and even though I was watching it a few days later, I am definitely glad that I did.

Throughout this time, Rick is torn between whether or not to help them escape, while wanting Ilsa all to himself. Bergman and Bogart both display such amazing acting skills, making the viewer really feel that they are in love. You can see Ilsa being torn between Laszlo and Rick and not knowing what to do as much as Rick doesn't know what to do. Aside from the story, the setting is really quite beautiful as well.

The costumes were appropriate for each character on set. It looked formal. I think the picture deserves a remake like the 1962 film Cape Fear. I felt like Humphrey Bogart had the same role like he does in other noir movies. Michael Curtiz captured the setting of Casablanca beautifully such as the palm trees, architecture and the Arab clothing. I enjoyed the other setting in the title, that was Paris.

One of my favourite parts of the movie, was the music. Much of the music early in the movie was not from the score, but from a character playing the piano, the songs that he plays play a small but important role in the plot, and I liked how they incorporated little things like that. Overall I really liked it, and it is one of my favourite movies I have watched from that time period.",

It felt very natural as if I were watching it play out in real life, which I believe was partly due to the script. Everything in the film was perfect, down to the costumes.",

We have Rick this tough character who owns the hottest bar in Casablanca. Then we have Ilsa, his ex lover from Paris (hence the famous line ""we'll always have Paris""). Ilsa is torn from her feelings from her husband Victor Laszlo and her ex lover Rick. This story is packed with drama and feelings from the past (""here's looking at you kid""). Some of the most infamous lines in movie history come from Casablanca. This movie definitely goes down as one of my favorite all time films.

The movie feature some of the greatest and most iconic Hollywood stars including Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Sydney Greenstreet. The movie is a classic for its terrific use of lighting in set and for some of the most memorable movie lines of all time. the filmmakers truly succeeded in making the film revolve around serious events like the state of France during World War II while also giving the film a sense of light-heartedness with subtle jokes and clever script writing. the love story in the film is believable because of the outstanding work by Bogart and Bergman and the viewer could see that there was really something between them throughout the movie.

At a time when the United States entered the second world war this film really hits the spot in the audiences minds filled with excitement and joy. Director Michael Curtiz really did a great job with the use of artistic and dramatic aspects as well as playing a key role in the use of visualization.

I'm not even sure why particularly, as technically there isn't really anything special about it, and if it weren't for a Red Dwarf episode- ""Camille"" I probably wouldn't have been interested in watching it. Nevertheless, there's something enduring about it that means no matter how many times you watch it, you're still not sure what the characters really want to do, Rick, Ilsa, and Renault are all 'real' characters, with choices that one wouldn't know how to make.

The film set is done so well, it really transports you to Casablanca. The cinematography really is phenomenal. The scene where Rick is getting drunk at the club after its closed, waiting for Ilsa to show up while Sam urges him to go home was shot so well. You see the search light beam pass him and the way the shadows play on his face and the entire room really makes you feel how miserable Rick is at that moment. My favorite scene was at the end when Ilsa and Victor get away and Rick shoots Heinrich. You expect Louis to arrest him, but he lets him get away and even plans his escape. the famous quote "" Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" comes from that scene.",

1114,7 March 2013,Poppybiscuit,6," Cringeworthy dialogue and humour - great cinema, embarrassing film.","Lots to like in terms of defining what a classic film is all about, and there are certainly some memorable quotes but most of the dialogue is so camp and cringeworthy, it is hard not to feel a little embarrassed most of the time. Nobody escapes the terrible script which is saved because I think the writer is trying to make this a comedy or a parody. A bit like Carry on Casablanca might be. I like Rick's response to Ilsa's leading question on the veranda in Paris. Most men would have followed Ilsa's lead and moved to the bedroom after the ""Is that cannon fire or my heart pounding?"" But not our manly Rick who replies with his highly interesting knowledge of tanks. The dialogue between Mr and Mrs Leuchtag. What watch - ten watch - such much - is typical of the dribble that is all through this film. I can't write but I know what a cringeworthy script is and this is one. Captain Renault has the highest proportional of bad one-liners though. I think he got his script out of some Christmas crackers. But there are plenty of great lines too so overall it carries itself through along with some great music and plenty of earnest overacting. I like the film - I just can't take it seriously. An 8.7 rating is only because there have been few too many sheep voting - it's great cinema, just not a very good film.",

The story was also very interesting. I liked the twist at the end. So simple, yet so complex. Thats kind of what the whole movie is. Very simple, but yet at the same time somewhat complex. And i think what makes it complex is Bogart's character. Its so hard to read his thoughts. Thus, displaying the good acting by Bogart.

First off is the cinematography, done by Arthur Edeson, the same man who was behind the brilliant and groundbreaking cinematography of Frankenstein, we can see some similarities in his style from Frankenstein to Casablanca. He took influence from German Expressionist films of the 20s and this influence is definitely well represented with all of the beautiful lighting and shadows and every range in between that he was well in control of. The cast was perfectly picked for these roles, each of them seems very natural in their expressions and reactions. Each of the sets are extremely detailed, and the special effects like the airplane would have been a big deal at the time. Curtiz is a great director and shows off his unique style here as well as in his other films from this era such as Mildred Pierce.",

""As time goes by"" will always remain a classic and the scene with Sam and Rick where Rick says ""You played it for her, you can play it for me. Play it, Sam"" is among the best movie lines ever. But my preferred line is when the movie gets to the end, ""Louie, i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"". Another unforgettable lines are ""We will always have Paris"" and ""Roun up the usual suspects"". Wonderful.

Casablanca is known for being one of the best films of all time, but personally I found it very bland. The plot was good in theory, but the emotional connection and feeling was not there. I could not connect to the characters or their story. Rick, the main character was the most interesting out of the characters and I enjoyed watching his relationship with Captain Louis Renault more than any other part of the movie. Their relationship was the most dynamic and interesting part of the film. The cinematography of the film was decent enough.

The acting by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman is so well done! It may be a little overly dramatic, but it's a drama so I expect it to be that way. I love the part where Humphrey and the French Police officer are watching Ingrid and her husband walk away into the fog on the airport runway. The cinematography is great also. A lot of shots were very unique but the most spectacular thing about this film is the use of it's dramatic lighting. It's used constantly through out the film. 3-Point, Back light, Key light, and Fill light! Always, nearly every shot seemed to have some sort of lighting factor in it. The lighting also persuaded the mood of the film immensely to me. When it was dark it seem mysterious and when it was normal light it just seemed neutral.

1129,24 October 2010,jejohnson2244,8," A Really Great Movie, However","I wouldn't say it was the best film ever made because it isn't. On the contrary though, it is a classic film that anyone would love and it is to me the grandfather of clichés. First off saying someone doesn't have a soul is clearly cold in my opinion because maybe they are literary, don't watch movies or just didn't understand it and they don't need to be penalized for it. It's an old film noir with really great dialog and amazing acting ( ahead of it's time) and it brings in what most cinema's have today, the art of clichés. First of all the main character Rick is a prime example of a tough guy, not buff, but he proves muscles don't make the man. Then you have Ilsa, the love of Rick's life and she bring the acting game up well. Now Ilsa is married to a guy named Victor Laszlo, and things get very complicated as the German police start to threaten throwing him in an isolation camp and you just have to see it for yourself. It starts with the atmosphere as the Warner theme plays and the map of Casablanca fades in, which loads of films used a lot later and gives that it is an action adventure romance. Next is the dialog, which strongly is by far the best I've heard in a movie to date which adds both mystery, romance, drama and most important humor which is kind of lacked in movies today. To continue we have the battle of the instruments (used in comedies), the mild bar fight which looked incredibly stunning for 1943( though it only lasted about 40 seconds) and finally a signature in westerns, the who shoots first duel at the very end which was fast paced but timed and played out very well. All in all a great film and as Rick said "" This looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship"". It's worth it.",

What I find unique and brilliant about Casablanca is that no one can take credit for this movie. Casablanca has no great ""auteur"". It's the product of the Warner Bros assembly line of the Forties.

My mother, both my grandmothers, and my one great grandmother all expected me to cry watching this movie, but the tears didn't even threaten to spill over. I did enjoy this movie though, a lot.

The Turner Classic Movie channel referred to her left said as her ""good side."" Shadows are used nicely in this film. The scene with Humphrey and Claude Rains (Captain Renault) utilized this. Bars of shadow often cover the faces of the actors to perhaps to insinuate imprisonment. The film also shows an interesting interpretation of pre-World War II.

The way the film looks is really cool, it doesn't look like other black and white movies either. Its different.",

The story was a relatable one, disenchanted lovers who meet again one day but seemingly cannot be together. The movie is magnificent at showcasing the highly interesting story of Rick, Ilsa, and all the dynamic characters they continue to meet along the way. Every main and supporting character in the movie was interesting and had depth beyond the surface. The story wasn't predictable and it kept me engaged throughout. The dialogue is one of my favorite aspects of Casablanca. Famous quotes such as ""Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the worlds, she walks into mine,"" sum up the characters' feelings, emotions, thoughts, and the type of person they are all through their dialogue. The cinematography is also a key to success for Casablanca. The attention to detail with shadows and soft lights creates beautiful scenes that convey tenderness in characters such as Ilsa or sadness in Rick. The movie, overall, is a piece of art that has and will continue to stand the test of time in cinema, and rightfully so.",

From the lighting to the timeless quotes I believe every aspect of this movie was done excellently. The two areas besides what the average viewer would notice that I would like to comment on are the lighting and the camera movement. First off the lighting through out the film helped to set every scene and the search light at night especially served as a reminder that despite the night clubs and the open markets Casablanca was not a totally free town. The other technical aspect that set this movie apart was the camera movement. The director managed to always have the cameras in the perfect place and all movements were very smooth. This film will always be a must see for any movie buffs.,
1168,5 May 2004,ShanghaichickS,10," Love, confusion, and constant battles between whats right, and whats desired.","Casablanca takes place in the little town of Morocco during WW11. Casablanca is a city that many refugees flee to, in search for a new life and a new world. When first watching this movie, the viewer (especially if the viewer is a female) cannot help but notice the romantic plot, the perfect romance plot at that. However, Director Michael Curtiz, focused on other elements in the movie to add more relevance that the viewer could better understand, and relate to. Though the entire story was fictional, the information that you receive from the plot is 100% true information about how life truly was during the war. The reality of the war really sets in, and it's inevitably that the audience will have compassion on what people went through during this time. 	Not only was the history and received information of this film outstanding, the characters were as well. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are a phenomenal asset to the film. There connection was so intense, that the whole room of viewers only just assumed that they were together.

1172,18 February 2006,Imaginist,10, Casablanca (5/5),"""Casablanca"" is a film that came out in 1942--a time of war and uncertainty. Nobody knew who was going to win the big one, and I believe that is the reason ""Casablanca"" became so popular and has remained so popular ever since. This film is about sacrifice--about doing the right thing even if it is at the expense of one's own happiness. ""Casablanca"" takes place in Morocco towards the beginning of WWII. At this time the Nazis had captured France, but Morocco, a French colony, was still considered to be free; however, Nazi influence over the nation was growing ever more. In fact, it could easily be said that Morocco had become a Nazi puppet nation. It is in this atmosphere that we meet Rick (Bogart in his greatest role), a cynical night club owner who doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything. We soon learn that his miserable outlook on life was caused by a woman named Ilsa (played brilliantly by Bergman) who had jaded him long ago. It is here in Casablanca that Rick plans on spending the rest of his days in isolation--his love of life has been sucked right out of him. However, Rick's world soon comes crashing down when Ilsa comes walking into his ""gin joint"" with her husband Victor (Paul Henreid). Victor is a part of the French Underground and is on the run from the Nazis; his escape route led him directly to Casablanca where he is now searching for two visas to America: one for him and one for Ilsa. In an ironic twist of fate, Rick happens to come across two visas when a friend of his, played by Peter Lorre, gives them to him to hide. Lorre's character was supposed to sell these very visas to Victor and Ilsa, and had arranged for a meeting at Rick's bar. Unfortunately, Lorre's character is arrested and thus Rick gets the visas. However Rick does not realize that these visas are for Ilsa and her husband, and Ilsa does not realize that the bar belongs to Rick, so when they meet it is by complete chance. Soon enough, Victor and Ilsa learn that it is Rick who has the visas and thus they try to persuade him to sell the visas to them. Rick is still bitter about being jaded by Ilsa long ago and therefore refuses to give them any such pleasure--Rick wants revenge. However Ilsa plans to persuade Rick, and in doing so she falls back in love with him--she is prepared to leave Victor for Rick, so long as Rick agrees to give Victor the visa. Rick agrees to the terms, and we soon have an uneasy feeling about the whole situation. This good man, Victor, may be getting a visa, but he is loosing a wife, and we know from Rick's experience that when people suddenly loose lovers they also loose their interest in life, and Victor cannot afford to give up his fight against the Nazis. It is here we see Rick's true character shine through all the cynicism; he engineers a plot that ensures that both Victor AND Ilsa get on that plane to America. Rick not only gives up any chance of getting out of Casablanca, but he also gives up Ilsa so that Victor may have her and that the both of them may continue their valiant underground fight against the Nazis. Rick also realizes that Casablanca has become too dangerous a place for Ilsa, and at the same time too dangerous a place for him as he is going to be punished for helping Victor, who is an enemy of the Nazis. Rick is prepared to sacrifice everything for a cause larger than himself, and that is why this film was so appropriate for the time in which it was made. ""Casablanca"" reminded America that they were now in a war and that sacrifice was going to be necessary of everyone--even those who wanted nothing to do with the world. Rick is the kind of person that we should all regard as a hero, for he puts aside his bitterness and even his own happiness for the sake of something vastly more important. Rick ensures that one of the underground movement's most valuable figures escapes the Nazis grip. However, Rick needed some inspiration in order to perform this valiant act. I believe that he was inspired by Victor, and came to realize that this man was an incredible human being. I also believe that Rick comes to realize that true love is doing what is best for a person, and not what is best for one's self, and thus he gives Ilsa up in order to ensure her safety. Rick was inspired by both patriotism and his devout love to Ilsa. Although Rick's actions may have been the result of some inspiration, they too would come to affect someone else: the chief of the French police in Casablanca (played wonderfully by Claude Rains). Here is a man who hates the Nazis but obeys their commands because it is in his best interest. However, when Claude's character sees the valiant actions of Rick, he too decides to denounce the Nazis. Besides the wonderful message and a host of intriguing characters such as Rick, ""Casablanca"" offers so much more: wonderful lighting, cinematography and acting, suspense, drama, romance, and some of the best lines ever written. Even the end of the movie is more than just a message; it also leaves us with a bitter-sweet taste, as Rick receives nothing and gives up everything. As stated, this was the kind of sacrificial attitude needed during WWII, and it is an attitude that continues to ring loud and clear throughout all desperate times. ""Casablanca"" deserves and receives: 5 out of 5 stars.",

I read things such as ""Ilsa is seen almost jumping out of the plane to get to Rick"".. and i think ""did you actually watch the movie? or did you want to just say you didn't like it because everyone else does?"" You should really watch it before you write down comments about that make you seem like a child. Sure, some people don't like it because of the accents, the black and white, or for their reasons, but a lot of people do and you sound stupid talking about things that never happened in the movie. Black and white is okay in movies, there are a lot of good black and white movies, and a lot were made when colour was around but they wanted the effect of black and white.

The use of light in this film in showing the seriousness of the characters was very prevalent. It showed the uncertainty of the characters. As the story progresses we learn more and more about the characters pasts and after a while you start to think you know a character but, their motivations and intentions turn out to be different then originally thought. I enjoyed that aspect because it kept me on my toes. The acting was very very well done especially by Humphrey Bogart, his take on Rick Blaine was seemingly tough and hard to crack but as the movie continues we see his more emotional side and who he is as a person. Overall the film was very beautiful in its camera-work, acting, lighting, and even the sets and costumes.

As many of following films have borrowed a similar story line and people all over quote lines from it lacking the knowledge that Casablanca is the film form which it originated. This is a subtle blend of love and loss along with the underworld gang politics. It takes place in a town called Casablanca in Morrocco. This is the place known to be ht elast chance of reaching the dream of a ticket out to America, the land of freedom, this being specified by the fact it takes place during WWII. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman make a beautiful on screen couple, who give off incredible chemistry not only romantically speaking but also acting wise. Bogart could't have added or taken away form his portrayal of a top man in the underground during those times. His natural charm shone through and there is such a mysteriousness to him that not only catches the audience but also captivates many women who surround him. Ingrid Bergman possess a flowing beauty that aided her performance of the only woman sane enough to break Bogart's heart. Casablanca is not only about a romance gained and then lost, but is deals with life back in WWII, when so much was kept as secrets and people lived in fear for their lives and future. Director Michael Curtiz and the writers definitely reflected their ingenious creativity by subtly placing a good amount of symbolism in Casablanca. Now aside from the shining stars Bogart and Bergamn it can not be left unsaid that what really made Casablanca spark was the presence of Sam's soothing piano playing. All in all the day Casablanca was introduced to its faithful fans was ""the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""",

Let me say that I am quite impressed!  We are living in a world today where men try to emulate and women are quite taken by those men who are the paragon of the tough, solid man, often with an attitude, which is all the while a somewhat thin front for a sense of sentiment and nobility.  Or, to put it another way, we love the bad-ass with a heart and a sense of right.  With all the actors that we see nowadays, and all the characters that they portray, it's easy to forget who many of these Hollywood molds owe their respects to.

Bergman and Bogart were amazing also and looked like they were meant for their parts. I found it so gripping when they were on screen together. What a dynamic duo. The story between Rick and Ilsa was so compelling in every way. The story also led into the narrative of Victor Laszlo (Henreid) and Sam (played by the superb Dooley Wilson who sang ""As Time Goes By""). Another great part of the movie was in Rick's bar club where Ilsa and Rick met again in Casablanca.

Coming as it did in the early years of the Second World War, when the outcome was far from certain, Casablanca stands as an astonishing act of bravado that offers a measure of hope without collapsing into propaganda slogans about the inevitability of victory. The particular ambiguity of the Vichy regime (that arresting opening, with the fleeing man shot under the the wall portrait of Marechal Petain proclaiming ""I keep not only my promises, but those of others"") is vividly captured in Casablanca, embodied in Capitaine Renault. The central romance has perhaps become a cliche in the eyes of modern viewers, because there have been so many parodies, reinterpretations, imitations. Yet there is something thrilling about a romance in which the carnality is implied rather than displayed in numbing (dare one say dull) detail, the easy way out taken by so many modern directors. Indeed, the most recent modern parallel to the plangent sexuality of Casablanca is the prison cell scene in Gladiator. Altogether a marvellous film of abiding quality, and just as a bonus, it offers the second-most blood-stirring version of the Marseillaise you will hear (first place is still claimed by Jessye Norman, draped in the French tricouleur, moving down the Champs Elysees, bringing tears to the soldiers of the honour guard during the bicentenary of the French Revolution).",

Some of the scenes were so beautifully picturised and depicted, my most memorable scenes are the one when Ilsa comes back to the bar to see Rick and Rick says i have kept the first drink for you (or similar to that not exact dialogue of course). In that scene both have done well and so human. Rick behaved like a normal man who would have behaved the way he does in the movie, when you encounter your or meet your broken love.

Bogart is brilliant and Bergman is arguably the most beautiful actress to have graced the silver screen. Bogart's characteristic dialogue delivery coupled with a well matched background score add to the atmosphere of a romance gone bad in the midst of the war. The genius of Casablanca lies in the fact that instead of introducing many characters, the makers of the movie have concentrated on just a few and developed them completely in the movie.

It is not about living in a foreign land and not knowing if you will ever get to a better place. It is also not necessarily a love story, at least not in the sense that it is about whether or not to people will fall in love and end happily ever after. At it's core Casablanca is about the effect that two people can have on each other and what effect the crossing of two paths can do. In almost every conceivable way Casablanca was one of the best technical cinematic works ever made. Every shot was elegant and extremely thought out. Weather it was a scene with one person in a dark room or a crowded street in the bright of day, nothing is out of place. Nothing is over or under done. While the story is well done it is also, in a way, boiler plated. I don't mean to say this negatively, rather as a complement to how timeless this story truly is. It could conceivably happen anywhere or any time in history. With all this said, I believe the most compelling and significant part of this movie is how it helped vault the American cinema to the top of the world.",

Every character had an agenda and it was up the audience figure it out. I have to say although the plot was explained to me, there was just so much going on and I am sure there were many subtle jokes that I missed.

It has its flaws, but for some reason it just works anyway. Some of the flaws are: Laszlo's character, which is so totally virtuous you just want to take out a gun and shoot him immediately (it was fine for the 40's, but I think we expect a bit more ambiguity in nice guys nowadays); the ridiculous final scene where we're expected to believe that Renault continues obeying Rick's instructions even though Rick has forgotten all about pointing his gun at him because he's too busy saying sweet nothings to Ilsa; and just generally I'm afraid the film is a bit sappy and full of cliches (and don't tell me this film invented the cliches, it didn't: they're as old as corny love stories, and those go back very far indeed). The reason it just works anyway is, I think, simply Bogart. No one ever incarnated so perfectly the man every man wishes he was and the man every woman wishes she could meet. And he smokes so beautifully... Bergman is great too, but her character isn't nearly as well developed.",

The worst thing that has ever happened to this movie was the issue of a colorized version several years ago, which is actually difficult to find.

I just recently became interested in movies and I am trying to watch many of the really old greats.  I recently watched The Third Man, Ben-Hur, Gone With the Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia.  Comparing all of these to Casablanca, they are all better.

It is rather depressing to go from Casablanca and look at what is coming out in theaters now-American cinema has really declined in quality since the age of Casablanca. Perhaps this is because the film industry was just starting out, and money could only be devoted to movies and ideas that really deserved it. Today, the film industry is so huge that even the trashiest films get funding and viewer time. The American Moviewatching Association ranks Casablanca #1 or 2 as the best American movie ever made, trading places every so often with Citizen Kane (another great classic).

1259,1 March 2009,nkthanksalot,9, how does this movie beat roman holiday in the ranking,"though i admit Casablanca is really a good movie.but i doubt that in any aspect it has advantage over roman holiday. the fact is,now,that Casablanca is treated as the top20 movie of all time,while roman holiday is on the edge of the top250. why? both of the movies should be called love story.and they are both romantic. maybe the fact is that women,who are always ready to watch a love film,prefer Casablanca,while man,who are not so interesting in love film,prefer roman holiday.that is because Casablanca is a story about a woman and two men who are both heroes.and roman holiday is a story about a poor man and a beautiful princess.",
1260,4 May 2015,larkinadrienne,10, Favorite Of All Time,"I am a 22 year old female, and I have no qualm in saying that Casablanca is my favorite of all time. And here is why. I did many a research paper on this cinematic gem. The reasons behind its success, the movie stars and their issues, the complete misunderstanding that they NEVER say ""Play it again, Sam"" (come on people, get it right) but nothing will ever speak to me as much as the nostalgia that comes with the Black and White motif and seeing Rick smoke a cigarette while playing craps as Sam plays ""As Time Goes By"". The softness of the movie, along with its Nationalistic overtones was so important to America is the WW2 times. It created soldiers so soon after the devastation of WW1. But besides that part of it, the love story of 2 who were so destined to be together that time could only keep them apart for so long. And the ending. Ah, the ending. That is my favorite. A man choosing to save the people he loves and cares for, more than save himself. What a groundbreaking and creative masterpiece.",
1261,29 May 2016,acvpvandebeek,9, Old but Gold,"Ah Rick Blaine the lone wolf who runs a respected saloon and he doesn't worry about anyone or anything. The way he's played is great and you can clearly see that he's respected by everyone that visits his saloon. I personally think that's his dialogue is one of the best there is, it's a bit comical yet very just. He's the kind of guy that you'd follow orders from regardless what they were, he has that kind of influence on the others in the movie.",

No, not all his movies stand out as masterpieces but among the actors who epitomize the Golden Age of Cinema, Bogart is at or near the top. That having been said, Casablanca stands apart. The story perfectly captures the complications and confusing ideals of the time. There are some characters who are clearly on the wrong side of good vs evil but so many of them (just like in life) are caught somewhere in the middle. Knowing what is right, and, doing what is right, becomes complicated. Casablanca is riveting cinema and stands as one of the top movies of all time. As with so many Golden Age movies, the acting is incredible and the pace is spot on. If you haven't seen this wartime classic, it's a must.",

A clean, heart-warming movie with no wasted dialog or scene. Crisp smart definitions of right and wrong, morally purposeful, this movie tells a great story in trying times. Simple and elegant, it makes me believe there was a time when moral ambiguity was fiction and strong people stood for principle. If you want to see a thoroughly enjoyable movie that makes you feel good, this is the one. You will enjoy all of the characters and the straight forward plot.

Bogey is the ultimate as far as a man being hardened by lost love, but softened with compassion for others in similar situations.

At 60+ years of age the dialog is still a thing of beauty - quick, funny, cutting. Rick casually cuts down important figures of the community with the briefest of comments. Watching this movie today you are instantly reminded of other modern classics, but then you have to know that this one launched them all. The dialog of Pulp Fiction - comedic banter about topics ranging from foot rubs to french cheese burgers are interspersed with scenes of high drama - how different is it here when you are looking at the possible collapse of a city at the hands of the Nazi's in the midst of WWII.

It's informative and 'draws back the curtain' on an event that has become history. Its 'slant' is propaganda but then, even in today's society, what isn't? It's a well structured screenplay worthy of study. It possesses quotable and re-quotable lines. Relax, sit comfortably, and enjoy being entertained!",
1279,22 April 2022,trblack3007,10, In America my thoughts would bring only a penny.,"Casablanca (1942) is as close to being a perfect movie as has yet been made. Whether or not this was accidental is immaterial. For whatever reason, the planets aligned and it happened. Each member of the cast was perfect in his or her role under the direction of arguably the best director of his day. The music was always entertaining and at least once, inspiring. The story was compelling and personal--who hasn't been deeply wounded by a former sweetheart? The cinematography was excellent. Eighty years later the dialogue continues to be witty and highly quotable. Not a scene, not even a shot, is wasted. Every character, whether major or minor, is developed enough that we have some insight into his or her personality--the patriotic guitarist, the brawling German and French soldiers, the lecherous Renault, the insecure Yvonne, the opportunistic Ugarte, the passionate Sascha, faithful Sam, the desperate Bulgarian newlyweds, ruthless Major Strasser, even the impatient banker from Amsterdam.",

After I saw it was listed as a romance movie, I was expecting something cliché, but the twists and turns that occurred as the movie went along caught me by surprised, and I became increasingly engaged with the story. The characters in this film, big and small, are amazing. Rick's development as the film progressed was a shock. The way he switched from a cold-hearted man without a care in the world to a lover with a heart was unforeseen. The backstory of Rick, Ilsa, and Sam is amazing. The antagonists are just as well written as the protagonists. Louis is one of the best characters in this movie. His lack of loyalty and unknown intentions are what makes him stand out from the rest.",

1284,6 July 2010,NoTimeForSargents,10, One of the best WW II movies,"Most people look back at WW II as the war that everyone supported. Yet the truth is that many Americans were much opposed to it. This is one of the few WW II movies that shows the ambiguous feelings of American towards the war. It is kind of amazing that such feeling could be shown in a movie that was made while the war was actually being fought and the outcome not known. Many people forget that WW II was often called ""Roosevelt's War"" before and shortly after it was started.",
1285,14 April 2011,mirus_amanda,8, Very good movie,This movie was very good I didn't know how I was going to like it since I've never really watched black and white films but I really got into it. The story line was good. The acting wasn't corny like other films around this time. After awhile you forget your watching a black and white movie. It might not seem that good at the beginning but don't just shut it off really watch it and trust me you will get into it. I didn't think I would but I did. This is a romantic film. The main guy is very much kept to himself he doesn't let himself get to close to anyone he has one best friend and that's it. Later on in the film it explains why he's like that but you got to watch the movie.,

CasaBlanca, as many fans out there concur, is one of the greatest examples of the golden era of the Cinema and their movies. There is beyond any doubt, this movie will become an instant classic of your collection and your heart. Is the one movie, you'll put in a pedestal, touching your inner fibers with random emotions, in the most positive way. A journey back into the past with the ""glamour"" that era is remembered. The empathy towards Rick Blaine ( Humphrey Bpgart) will grow and grow as the movie develops, and an ending... that will blow your mind. Is simply the perfect combination of characters, personalities, dialogues, scenery, it is simply EXTRAORDINARY !!!! Spare two hours of your time to watch this movie, and be amazed of an unforgettable experience. And...."" Play it, Sam """,
