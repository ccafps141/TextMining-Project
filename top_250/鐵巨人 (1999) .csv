0,6 August 1999,Wizard-8,10, YES!!!!! NO SONG OR DANCE NUMBERS!!!!!!,"What a GREAT movie! Not just for kids, but adults as well. Kids will love it on one level, and adults will love it on another level. Even adults who are not parents will love it!",/
1,18 November 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10, Outstanding on all levels!,"The Iron Giant was a beautiful, funny and touching movie, that is one of the best non-Disney animated movies I have seen along with The Prince of Egypt, The Secret of NIMH, Watership Down and Castle of Cagliostro. There wasn't a single thing I hated about the movie, for me it was outstanding on every level. The animation was absolutely gorgeous, with stunning colourful backgrounds and brilliant character animation especially on the Iron Giant himself. The music by Michael Kamen was consistently excellent, and never overpowered the story. In fact at times it even enhanced the drama. And the film has a beautiful message not to mention a sweet story. The characters were delightful, Hogarth isn't annoying at all and the Iron Giant isn't scary in the slightest. Strictly speaking he has to be one of the most gentle and poignant characters in an animated film. There are plenty of effective scenes like the explosive climax and the scene with the dead deer is a real tear jerker. I will admit I was worried initially when I saw the voice cast, but everybody involved did a superb job. Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jnr were perfect, in their most understated performances. Both get stick about being untalented, but for me their vocal contributions in this film suggests otherwise, while Christopher MacDonald almost steals the film as the FBI agent. Eli Marienthal is very sweet and likable as Hogarth too, and watch out for John Mahoney and Cloris Leachman. All in all, an outstanding film, that if you mind me saying so is the best animated film of 1999 and one of the best films of that year too. I may be wrong but I do think it is highly underrated on IMDb. 10/10 Bethany Cox",r

The old Disney classics that started it all are indeed aimed at kids, but are still very watchable, even for adults.  With the advent of TOY STORY and its countless mimics,  animated feature films have taken long strides to be considered worthy of serious attention.  THE IRON GIANT is just such an animated piece.  The 87 minute wonder is, to put it mildly, incredible. Everything about it is good.  I've also never seen so many influences and references in an animated film before.",v

8,7 February 2000,Hitchcoc,8, Much More Than a Cartoon,"Sometimes when watching an animated feature, I spend my time saying, ""What great animation."" When this happens, I wonder if I am doing what the producers wanted me to do. Like so many things, should I be so enamored with the technical part of the movie that I am distracted from the content. As I watched ""The Iron Giant"" I realized I had forgotten it was an animated feature. Don't get me wrong. I knew the enormous title character was animated, but the relationships among the characters and the intelligence of the script caused me to forget that these weren't actors. The movie is filled with tender moments, especially as they relate to our feelings of our own mortality. What I enjoyed is that the grownups aren't treated as garden variety bad guys. Even the military, which is nearly always portrayed as evil, finds itself in a contradictory position--having to go on faith. The animation is wonderful, but so are the ""performances."" No spoilers here, but I think the ending is a lovely tribute to the spirit of the life force in all of us--even those of us not made of metal. See this. It is one of the better movies of the year.",r
9,14 August 2006,p.greenwood,10, Stunning and magical,"I had heard many great things about the iron giant in the last few years but was one of those films I never got round to seeing. I picked up a copy of the special edition DVD expecting an entertaining animated film. What I actually got was not just one of the best animated films I have seen but one of the best films ever. It takes you to another world but never strays from reality and when watching it you forget it's animated. The characters are so well written it puts most live action films to shame. If you pass this off as a kids film you will be missing out on one of the most immersing and emotional experiences you can get from a film. The voice cast are perfect, the animation stunning and the fact this film flopped when released is nothing short of criminal. I urge anyone even with only a passing interest in cinema to watch this film and prepare to be amazed. Brad Bird must be one of the best directors working in animation and after seeing the incredibles the iron giant was no fluke.",w

12,5 April 2022,TheMysteriousReviewer,10, An Underrated Animated Masterpiece,"I'm going to say one thing. When I first saw this back in 2016, it did seem interesting to me. I thought it would be just an enjoyable sci fi film. But honestly, I did not expect this to be one of my favorite animated movies. The Iron Giant may possibly be the best animated movie Warner Bros has produced worldwide. At first, it seemed it was just gonna have a little cheesy giant monster film. But this is more than that. The story was incredibly written that's about a giant robot that is taught to be a civilized monster. It has profited a lot of character development. And this has presented top notch animation with some of the best effects for an animated film. It's not enough to make a reason how I consider this a masterpiece. It's how heartfelt it is. If you have actually seen monster movies, the setting is in the 50s. And you'll see they normally either take over cities or destroy the world. But this is a lot different. This is about how the giant learns about the world, what happens in life and why everyone would be afraid of him. I'm not gonna spoil it, but let's say that the ending has been a true example. No matter what, you got to watch this film. The one thing that shocked me is it wasn't much successful at the box office. And now many people has given so much attention many years later. Not only is this one of the most underrated movies I've seen, but also one of the most feel good movies I've seen. As the giant himself said it best, souls never die.",1

14,26 May 2009,Simon_Says_Movies,10," As touching, funny and timely a film as any committed to celluloid","Having to compete with Disney, Dreamworks and Pixar, Warner Brother's animation has never been at the forefront of the animation industry. Apparently all they needed was the brilliant Brad Bird to quell any doubt about their capabilities. The Iron Giant is one of the final films to be presented in the traditional animation form, but even this flick had begun the transition to computer generated visuals. A number of characters, including the giant, were inserted digitally over the hand drawn background, taking special care to perform this imperfectly so as to contrast the rougher backdrop. The finished piece is a visually flawless and captivating film and ranks among the best animated features to ever grace the screen.",6

17,19 February 2021,BabelAlexandria,9," Who Is the Iron Giant, and Why has he Come to Earth?","Neither of these questions is answered in this charming movie, based on a novel by Ted Hughes, but it doesn't seem to matter. The Iron Giant is highly emotional film, but in an understated way. The scenes of 1950s small town Maine were highly evocative without being overly nostalgic. Hogarth is a great role model for young boys, even if he can be a bit impulsive and doesn't always listen to authority figures: he cares deeply for animals, and in this case, his robot friend, whom he looks after and instructs as if a young child. Not having experienced that era myself, the depiction of the Iron Giant nonetheless reminded of postwar Science Fiction covers, as in Tales to Astonish, etc., even if his gentle character did not. And I liked the anti-gun theme: Hogarth's toy gun ""triggers"" the self-defense mechanism in the robot, who gradually learns of his strength and automated programming, and, with the help of Hogarth, fights it: ""I am not a gun."" I also appreciated the ambiguity of the robot: is it aliens? Russians? Does it matter?",/

I remember the boy, the Iron Giant and the woods, that's it. With the release of Multiversus, where Iron Giant is a playable character, I decided it was about time I rewatched this classic masterpiece of a movie. And this is probably the best animated movie ever. I love the look and feeling of this movie. It's a world you want to be in. The characters have depth, the animation is classic and the story is emotional and just fantastic. About the animation, I know that now we are experiencing the peak of animation, everything is realistic, we have realistic fur, crazy details in the animation and the line between real life and animation is almost barely visible. But I still prefer this kind of animation. It's animation, it isn't supposed to be real life. But anyways, the story is just fantastic. I never really cry with movies.

I recommend this movie to everyone. It's not just for kids. The animation, editing and soundtrack is amazing. I am a huge fan of Disney movies, but I cannot think of a Disney movie that can touch the Iron Giant on any level. This movie can be enjoyed by kids, parents and non-parents alike. It's not just a great action movie with great writing it will also touch you on an emotional level as well. I have been waiting and watching for a sequel, but I don't think anyone involved in this production intended to do another (even though the ending leaves that wide open). This is the type of movie I wish Hollywood would do more of, instead of re-makes and movies based of TV shows.",_
27,24 August 2015,moviemattb,10, Brad Bird's Greatest Achievement,"I have seen many promos with this movie on television, and was curious to see it. Sadly, I didn't, so I guess you can say that I was lazy for not seeing it. No matter, I did see this on HBO and watch this many times as it aired as a 24 hour marathon on Cartoon Network when Warner Bros and Cartoon Network were promoting ""The Powerpuff Girls Movie"" with a music video during the end credits of ""The Iron Giant."" The movie itself feels timeless, and I know this movie will continue to find an audience despite of its failure at the box office when it first came out in theaters. I am more than happy that this movie has a cult following, and there many fans that are embracing it. With that said, ""The Iron Giant"" its about a boy named Hogarth Hughes who lives with his mother Annie a waitress has discovered a giant metallic robot, who fell from space and befriends him. A beatnik artist Dean McCoppin looks out for the Giant at a junkyard, but federal agent Kent Mansley wants to find the Giant and destroy it. The movie is itself is like Steven Spielberg's ""E.T. the Extra Terrestrial,"" but it acts very much its own movie. I continue to love this movie as I watch it, and I see nothing wrong about it. The movie does look gorgeous in widescreen as it gives it a much epic feel to it in a CinemaScope format. As much as we love animated movies in CGI like Pixar or DreamWorks, but I do think its beautiful to see an animated movie to be all done traditionally by hand instead of having it all done by a computer. The animation is again beautiful with all the rich colors, and details that were all put into this movie. I do love how the movie looks as the movie takes place in 1957. The movie does have some funny moments, and I guess a bit edgy for an animated movie that features some curse words. The movie is made for kids, but its something that adults would enjoy. Hey, when I first saw this movie, I didn't expect to hear any curse words in an animated movie which I thought it was going to be a clean animated movie like what Disney did with their animated movies. I guess both Bird and Warner Bros. want it to take it up a notch. The movie is rated PG, and nothing to be worrying about. Or shocking for that matter. I do love the characters, and really love the way they're designed. Also, I thought it had great voice acting. Jennifer Aniston; Harry Connick, Jr.; Eli Marienthal and Christopher McDonald were all really good for their own roles. Vin Diesel, I thought, was perfectly cast for voicing the Iron Giant, and can't imagine any one voicing it aside from Diesel. Michael Kamen's score to the movie is very good, and nothing more that I can say about. I love its story and the direction that the filmmakers went, and I think its perfectly executed. This is Brad Bird's greatest achievement, and should be given a lot of credit for making this wonderful movie. I have heard that Bird and Warner Bros. are both working on bringing this movie for a limited release this year on September the 30th, and October the 4th for remastering it and presenting two new scenes for the movie. This new cut will be called ""The Iron Giant: Signature Edition."" I am very excited about it, and would love to see this on the big screen like I never had before. I love ""The Iron Giant,"" and I am giving this movie a 10 out of 10.",u

29,30 November 2021,josefjbarnes,10, A powerful film,"I am a fully grown adult who was not allowed to watch this movie as a kid so there is no nostalgia speaking when I say this is possibly the best film ever created. The funny parts are extremely funny and the emotional parts are extremely emotional. I think if I watched this as a kid I would have enjoyed it but definitely not as much as I do as an adult. I also believe that this is a very important film for kids to watch. It is rare for a children's movie to have such a strong message that isn't just a shallow ""guns are bad"" movie. There are obviously low points (as there are with every movie) but the high points are so high that they make up for the low points and then some. If you are an parent who is hesitant about showing this to their child, just do it. But don't just show them this movie, sit down and watch it with them. I can almost guarantee you will find something to love about it.",v

I love the giant and Hogarth's dynamic, and the animation. It's got some amazing visuals for an animated movie from 1999. I really wish there were more with that style. As far as storyline goes, it's amazing. It's perfectly paced, and the movie isn't very long at all.

To this day i considered Lion King the greatest animated film of all time...until last night. I always remember seeing Iron Giant advertised but never bothered to watch it. Last night I was blown away! I usually put something on for background viewing while I go to sleep but Iron Giant had me hooked. I was naive thinking this was just a kids film. The animation is beautiful, the story is gripping and the characters are genuinely believable.

37,25 July 2017,ironhorse_iv,8," This animation movie deserves a giant applause! It was a great film, with hardly any sign of rust!","It's sad, that this animated movie was not a huge hit, when it came out in 1999, due to poor-marketing. Nevertheless, as time, with on, 'The Iron Giant' has grown widespread critical acclaim from both critics and audiences for its out of this world story about an friendship between, a 50-feet alien robot (Voiced by Vin Diesel) & a young boy, Hogarth Hughes (Voiced by Eli Mariethal) in a rural part of Maine; while, an over paranoid government agent, Kent Mansley (Voiced by Christopher McDonald) tries to hunt them, down, fearing that the giant could be dangerous. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while some of the plot-points does sound a little too familiar, as if it's ripping off, 1982's 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' in the first half. I have to say, the story in the second half, is still unique enough to stand out on its own. The movie has a lot of strong themes that films like 'E.T' doesn't deal with, such as an anti-nuclear war message. I like how the Giant has to deal with his inner conflict as a doomsday weapon; similar to how humans have to deal with the destructiveness nature of themselves, during the Cold War. Somber scenes like when, Iron Giant & Hogarth greets the deer, really does show, the good of humanity, and how, losing our humanity, makes us, into cold-blooded machine, like the hunters, later in that moment. However, it's not, all gloom and doom, as there is also an equally satire funny side to the film's anti-war message, with Agent Mansley, acting upon violence, without thinking or getting to know, the other side. It gave us, some of the best moments like the mitt phone call to general, Shannon Rogard (Voiced by John Mahoney) or landside ice cream scenes. Also, the child-like, interaction, between Hogarth & the Iron Giant was equally as fun to watch. The diving scene, alone, makes this film, worth seeing. Regardless, of the tone of the film, the movie really does capture the era, full of panic, fear and anxiety as leading politicians and the media whipped the public into an escalating mass frenzy, over Nuclear War with the Soviets, in both satirical and serious ways. It's a film, both children and adults would love. Yet, there is some things, that people might not, like, about this film, such in the case that the story of the movie bears very little resemblance to author, Ted Hughes's novel, 'the Iron Man', in which, it loosely based on. Not only is the settling change from United Kingdom, to United States, but the film also, cut, most of the fantasy parts, such as the battle with the Space-Bat-Angel-Dragon. Another thing, that the film cut, was the fact that the giant robot was a harmony of the spheres whom keeps the cosmos in balance, by singing in the ocean. Because of this change from siren to alien robot, the original producer, guitarist Pete Townshend, from the rock band, 'The Who', instead, chose to release a rock opera adaptation, 'The Iron Man: A Musical', in 1989. Regardless, of the changes, the movie still has amazing soundtrack by composer, Michael Kamen. Great use of collection of Bernard Hermann cues from 50's and 60's sci-fi films. Not only that, but wonderful voice acting from everybody in this film, ranging with Jennifer Aniston as the mom, Annie to supporting voice actors like Harry Connick Jr. as dead-on, beatnik, Dean McCoppin. Another great thing, about this movie is the animation. I love how director/animator, Brad Bird and his crew, blend the CGI Giant with hand-drawn Norman Rockwell, mixed with 1950s illustration so well. Everything looks and feels the era. It really does mesh. Even the pacing for 'the Iron Giant' was, well-done. However, I don't think, the signature edition is the best version of the movie. The once delete scenes of Annie & Dean, talking in the diner, doesn't really add much, as we see them, interact, later in the film. Another thing, I don't like, about this version is the dream sequence. It really ruins, the mystique of the Giant, by revealing, too early that he is a doomsday weapon. I really don't like, how jarring, it is. I would, rather have the fight in the junkyard, instead. It's a little stronger, as it has weight, due to Giant, nearly killing the person, he love, due to his programming. It makes the climactic, tear-jerking ending, a little more powerful. Don't get me wrong, I still think the Signature Edition is a good version to have, if you're a mega fan, but if you haven't seen the movie, just watch the original theatrical cut of the movie. Overall: I like how this film is picking up in popularity, due to the film's director, going on to direct, other animation hits like Disney's 2004's 'The Incredibles' & 2007's 'Ratatouille'. While, it's still not a household name. I think, with each new generation. Both children and adults will come to love, this film for its creativity, comedy and heart. It's highly recommended. An animation classic & masterpiece.",

I also do not remember any 1950's communist paranoia in the book or the character of Hogarth being so young. But the changes do not harm the movie and the ending this film has is just fine. There are obviously no opening credits to the film so guessing the voices is cool fun. But it's impossible to guess who plays the Iron Giant.,

45,4 March 2007,jaredmobarak,8, Duck and coverThe Iron Giant,"I finally took the time to see writer/director Brad Bird's first foray into feature length film with The Iron Giant. Hearing how great of a film it was and the success of his Pixar debut The Incredibles, I've been seeing the movie on my shelf for a while now, just waiting to finally be viewed. If you thought his last movie had heart, you need to see this one. While being based on a book, I'm not sure if it is the original source material or Bird's vision on screen, but the parallels to King Kong are unmistakable. This creature from another world instills fear into all but one personone person who can see beneath the harsh exterior into the wealth of feelings and compassion bottled up within. Sure the beauty in a story like King Kong is the sacrifice he makes in order to keep his love safe at the unfortunate price of being a monster in the eyes of everyone else, but here we have a kid's story where happy endings aren't just a commonality but a necessity. Bird handles the subject matter nicely at the end in order to give the audience the same emotional attachment to the creature despite the fact that the general population does end up seeing him for what he truly is. Ala Superman/Spider-Man/ etc, the monster mystic soon dissolves as they begin saving human lives.",

Warner Bros. Feature Animation had a moderate hit with Space Jam, but underperformed with the likes of Cats Don't Dance and Quest for Camelot. They had one bona fide hit with The Iron Giant, a truly wonderful little feature adapted from Ted Hughes' 1968 novel The Iron Man. It didn't leave much of a dent at the box-office, but found a loyal audience on home video. In the 19 years since its release, The Iron Giant is fondly remembered as one of best animated features of the 1990s, and saw director Brad Bird poached by a little up-and-coming studio called Pixar.",

49,21 December 2005,ebiros2,9, Brings tears to my eyes,"This is perhaps the best animated movie I've ever seen. Iron Giant is a no name robot who's origin and purpose for creation is unknown, but is surprisingly innocent and powerful. It has a sense of purpose and has loyalty and decency we don't even see in ourselves until it is provoked and shows what it might have been created for - weapon of mass destruction. Who created the Iron Giant with its heart of gold and body as indestructible weaponry ? Was it part of an unknown robot army from another planet that got strayed from its squadron ? The story leaves lots of plot holes that beckons us to know more about this character. Would the writer of this story do a sequel that fills in all the gap in the robot's back ground, and help us look deeper into its character ? It seems to be one of the best character to come along in many years. Although the scope and the period setting is similar to ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" this animated character is much more lively, and thought provoking.",
50,6 December 2007,ferbs54,8, I Should've Listened To My Nephew...,"Back in 1999, when ""The Iron Giant"" was first released, several friends of mine, aware of my love for 1950s sci-fi films, urged me to go see this movie. For some reason, I passed. A few years later, another friend's 4-year-old son told me what a great video this was, but I still declined to watch it. And even later, when my own nephew (then 6) told me what a hilarious scene he'd just witnessed in ""The Iron Giant"" (the one in which young Hogarth drinks espresso and starts talking a mile a minute)...well, even then, I still ignored the advice. Anyway, all the above folk will be happy to hear that I finally DID watch this animated sci-fi film last night, and found it absolutely charming. Featuring wonderful animation, nice touches of warmth and humor, and wry commentary on '50s paranoia and A-bomb lunacy, the film really does have appeal to young and old. Lovers of sci-fi and/or action films should especially enjoy the film's latter scenes, in which the lovable Giant gets ticked off and morphs into an unstoppable killing machine. My hat is certainly off to everyone involved in the making of this most entertaining film. And this ""special edition"" DVD, filled with more extras than you can imagine, certainly does live up to the advertising. Hmmm...maybe I SHOULD take my nephew's advice and finally rent out his favorite movie, ""Toy Story 2""...",

Essentially friendless, Hogarth has a vivid imagination and a sens of wonder that we all lose as we age. He discovers a giant robot and befriends him. Yes, in similar fashion to ET, the Hogarth tries to hide the giant from the authorities. Also like ET, he fails.

53,5 February 2012,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,8, The Iron Giant (1999),"I watched this for the first time in 13 years just now. Saw it at the cinema originally, and it was truly a sight to behold. It still holds up today and the animation looks incredibly fresh. The Iron Giant sees a large robot land on Earth in the 50's. A young boy soon makes friends with it, while a government agent investigates the sightings. The robot has forgotten who he is, but trouble arises when his built in defence mechanisms may be a danger to the small town. The Iron Giant is base on the book The Iron Man written by Ted Hughes. A book I remember from primary school. This adaptation has Americanized it, as well as making it more of a space themed Sci-Fi. The book had a battle with a space dragon, something I would have actually liked to see, even if it didn't work. The 50's setting is perfect for this kind of film. It's all about friendship, and being able to make choices no matter how we were raised. The giant is both sympathetic and cute, as well as being dangerous. It's the age old case of violence begets violence. I did find certain moments rushed in the film, as animation is usually short, but most of all I had trouble associating with Kent Mansley. He just goes too haywire towards the end. This is great stuff though, with strong animation, good vocal performances, exciting action sequences, and messages about friendship, peace, and sacrifice.",

55,9 January 2016,sharky_55,8, I am not a gun.,"It is 1957 in the small town of Rockwell, Maine, and America is in the midst of the Cold War, so naturally this gives the film an aura of unsettledness and paranoia. And also naturally, children are less concerned with this, and take more risks, and their naivety leads to some unforeseen consequences. Brad Bird sprinkles a little social commentary in it too; sometimes it's delightfully light like the mock educational short film that displays the proper nuclear bombing etiquette to school children, or it's loud and brusque like the panicked way that G-man Kent Mansley defers to military action and presence whenever possible.

Despite receiving critical acclaim, it was a box office flop on its original release due to poor marketing. However, thanks to a growing cult following on VHS and DVD, and the film's director Brad Bird creating Pixar powerhouses like The Incredibles and Ratatouille, the film eventually went from an underrated gem to one of the greatest animated features ever made.

When a giant robot falls from the sky the only witness is believed to be imagining things at first but young Hogarth Hughes believes him and goes out to investigate; he finds the huge robot devouring the metal at an electricity substation. While he is watching the robot is electrocuted and but he saves it by turning off the power. The robot appears friendly and starts to follow him home; unfortunately he causes a train crash and soon afterwards Government Agent Kent Mansley arrives and sets about searching for the robot; his only clue leads him to the Hughes household where he soon suspects Hogarth knows far more than he is letting on. Hogarth manages to hide the giant in the local scrap yard, which is run by Dean McCoppin; a friendly beatnik who uses the scrap to make his 'art'. Eventually it emerges that while the robot is friendly it has formidable defensive capabilities that could make it extremely dangerous if attacked... which is just what happens when Mansley gets the army in.",

The giant is obviously sent to invade the earth and attack humans, but because of the ""bump on his head"", he has forgotten his mission and is, as a child, slowly exploring the world around him and beginning to understand the facts of life.

81,27 October 2004,Juni78ukr,10," Quite simply, this is the best non-Disney animated movie.","I'm so glad that I finally found this masterpiece five year after this movie has been released. This is a really great movie and in my opinion it's one of the best animated movies ever made. I think the biggest flaw of the Disney animation is the complete lack of human characters. Disney and now Dreamworks made movies about fishes, sharks, bears, lions, dogs, bugs, ants, toys, superheroes and many other animals and creatures but you can hardly find single movie with human character from a real life . Well, all their characters can talk, feel and behave like humans but it is not the same. Most of their recent movies were good, funny and entertained but at the same time they look a bit childish and not so emotional, even cold. They are typical commercial stuff and with strong marketing studios often get good box office returns. The Iron Giant is a different case. This is a very intelligent, good-feeling and enjoyable animation with powerful and clever moral messages in its core. At first sight it looks like a kids movie but it's a wonderful movie both for kids and adults. In fact the movie idea could have been unnoticed for small kids. The story happens in 1957 in small town in Maine. It was a years of the cold war and military paranoia, a period of total fear and misunderstanding from both sides. It was really amazing to watch how brilliant was recreated the atmosphere of that period. All begins than the Hogarth, a young fatherless lonely boy found near his home mysterious Iron Giant. I think it was s a clever idea what we'll never know where this giant come from. Different and unknown doesn't always mean bad and enemy. Hogarth helped him and they become friends. He gave Iron Giant some moral lessons and even taught a basic English. But when in the town comes paranoiac special agent Kent Mansley they friendship now is in a danger. He wants to kill the Giant without any reasonable reason, just because he think what this strange robotic Iron Giant can be dangerous. Most surprising and intelligent element in the story was the fact that this movie didn't become a cheesy childish anti-gun propaganda. The message is more wise and intellectual. As Hogarth said we are what you we choose to be. Our acts are always our individual decisions and some things can't be simply bad or good, and only our choice can decide how we can use them. Also you can find in this movie many other strong philosophical ideas and thoughts. Overall, the story of friendship between young boy and The Iron Giant is very touching and emotional. ",

It's been said already, but this film really does combine the best of both worlds. It's silly and slapstick enough to make the kids laugh, and has enough subtle and sophisticated humour for the adults too. In fact, the comedy is what makes this film so special. The jokes are consistently excellent, and it's highly unlikely that anyone can keep a straight face throughout. It's funnier than the Disney/Pixar efforts, save Toy Story, and in fact it's better than most comedies you'll see.",

I saw it once in the theater and loved it from the start. A few years passed by before I saw it again and I loved it even before upon my second viewing. As I've gotten older, I've come to respect it even more for being a film of quality substance, excellent animation, humor, voice casting, and even great action sequences. It's a film that's not afraid to get violent from time to time, not even to show a tad bit of blood, but it doesn't go over its head to disturb the kiddies too much. That's why parents are recommended to view it with them.",

It includes some ideas regarding the dangers of guns that must make the NRA (National Rifle Association) furious. But mostly it is about what it means to be a thinking creature, Too bad I can't say more for fear of revealing too much. Great thinking, great images, an amazing rendition of falling snow etc...

The film, surely, has to be recognised as one of the last, great two dimensional animated films that the Americans made at the back end of an era. If we formally acknowledge that the new 'era' of animation is, or was, from 1999 onwards predominantly three dimensional from an American perspective, then this is the last great film of that time. Here is an animated film that does not rely on purely the visual, even if they are as impressive as they need to be and opts for story telling and emotional involvement more than anything else. Sprinkle on a little bit of Cold War paranoia and you have The Iron Giant, a period set character study of a human being and a creature not of this world.",

Now, in the 90s, particularly the late nineties, there were a rush of animated movies not made by Disney or any real animation company that won't happen again. It was an interesting time for animation.

""The Iron Giant"" is an example of one that completely succeeds in that area. The opening where Hogarth goes on the roof to check the antenna and then into the woods with the flashlight has much more suspense, as it appears to be night in the Signature Edition. The glowing power station and the Iron Giant getting shocked by the wires has much more pop in the Signature Edition. Hogarth coming up the stairs with the TV lighting the stairwell when he goes to check on the noise upstairs while watching TV is another good example.",

The Iron Giant is simply put, one of the most beautiful and simple stories ever told in an animated feature. I went to see it 5 times in my country, and each time i couldn't help the tears. Gee, this is such a very touching film. Now i know it's getting high on video rent, but you'll never experience it as in the theater. It really makes us think about not judging a book by it's cover.

A kid that founds ""someone"" that is very unusual or big, no ones believes him. Then people discover that he does exist and are afraid can be harmful, so they decide to eliminate him. Then at the end, that creature confirms he is good and it's a happy ending. So it was very predictable for me, but it doesn't mean it was bad. Another thing is that it let me with some questions like, where does the robot come from? How does he understand so well English? But I think that the movie let that to the audience to think.

Adults, especially those growing up in the 50s or 60s, will relate well to this film, knowing what it was like to grow up during the trials and uncertainties of the Cold War. ""The Iron Giant"" tells the story of young boy Hogarth Hughes befriending a gigantic metal robot who has crash-landed on the earth from space. The government is suspicious, as usual, and wants to destroy the robot. Hogarth teaches the robot the truths and choices of using his powers for good rather than evil. What makes up this film is a very fun collection of humor and suspense. The humor is top-notch, from Hogarth saying grace and trying to hide the robot's missing hand at the same time to Hogarth's hyped-out experience after drinking espresso. It is also compelling and touching, as Hogarth and the giant must make choices and learn lessons throughout the film. What an enjoyable film.

Whereas the original novel was a poetic and lyrical fairytale that read like modern mythology, Brad Bird's movie is a straight up sci-fi movie in the vein of 'E.T.' Set during the era of the Soviet launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 and the ensuing Cold War panic, the whole thing looks like the kind of movie that Disney used to make at the time, all beautifully painted backdrops and hand-drawn characters. The evocation of the era is very well done, with a careful and detailed eye for period ephemera and styling. It's a gentle and affectionate movie with a distinct lack of the knowing, adult-oriented, pop-culture referencing attitude of most recent animation. But this back-to-basics approach, while refreshing, seems a little too simple, too naïve, and too superficial. It's a good movie, and one I would encourage children to see, but a lot of rich potential was sorely missed.",

The script respects the intelligence of young and old, and the under-90 minutes running time attests to the brisk pace and judicious lack of exposition. Our hero Hogarth has a child-like curiosity about his new friend, and a fierce loyalty, all the while keeping sentimentality in check. A quasi-religious theme is lightly threaded through, and an anti-war message is more more strongly foregrounded.

The setting, which is in the cold war culture of the 50's, is also an added bonus to the story as the fear of the Giant gets out of hand.

The animation is indescribable, but I'm just going to say that it borders on indisputable timeless with its effects and how the 3D mixes in with the 2D. Each of the important characters are hilarious, menacing, or a combination, and even the recurring ones are more than just tolerable.

And the robot seems to have artificial intelligence that allows it to evolve, learn, and feel. Insidious government agent (voiced by Christopher MacDonald; who better, right?) sets his sights on the robot and wants the military to obliterate it, convincing military general (John Mahoney of Frasier fame) to assist in firing upon it, which puts the boy, Hogard (voiced by Eli Marienthal), in jeopardy. Hogard's harried, single mother is voiced by Jennifer Aniston and the Iron Giant is beautifully voiced by Vin Diesel. Harry Connick, Jr. voices junk metal artist, Dean, who also bonds with Hogard and provides refuge for the Iron Giant at his junkyard. The Iron Giant is a feast for the eyes of fans of comic book robots from the old school. Terrific animation in a very Ray Bradbury-esque small town, including some damn strong storytelling revolving around a boy and a robot that find a friendship full of wonder and awe, caught the attention of critics; this was just a sample of Bird's gifts. The disembodied robot hand following Hogard around in his house while MacDonald's Kent Mansley finds him suspicious and tries to snoop on his activities is a knockout! Best scene could be when Hogard first meets the giant as he rips into power lines and metal structures for nourishment. Also dazzling is a scene involving train tracks as Hogard pleads with the giant to repair it as a locomotive approaches. The way Bird lights the Iron Giant as distantly sinister only to convince us of how harmless he looks and acts when up close speaks about how we should wait before assuming something is dangerous until the evidence presents itself. The ending which has various body parts trying to find themselves in a return to a whole and the Iron Giant sacrificing itself for Hogard makes the heart sing. A special treat. Just wonderful. Cloris Leachman, James Gammon, and M. Emmet Walsh also contribute voices to members of the town.",

171,21 October 1999,Blackace,9, This Iron Giant Will Touch Your Heart And Move Your Soul,"What a wonderful story this cartoon tells. The Iron Giant tells the tale of a young boy who comes in contact with a Giant Robot from outer space. As the robot is trying to feed himself with powerline girders, he's tangled up in the live wired and unable to escape. The frightened boy (Huglow Hughes) rescues him. What follows from that point is true friendship, lessons of war, anger, parenthood, and the bound between a boy a Giant Robot with incredible capabilities. This movie is great family entertainment and should be seen with your kids or parents. Basing this story in the 1950's was a great idea, since war was just itching to happen and people didn't really have a whole lot back then. A little boy and his Mother just getting by in a small town of Roswell, ME really shows that adventure and the love of life can be found anywhere you go. The seen with the deer dying and the explanation of guns killing people were right on target. Yes, guns don't kill people. People kill people, but with GUNS. The NRA may not like this movie, but the fact that it shows parents and kids alike that guns can cause violence and bad things to happen is perfect in this day in age. The movie isn't very long, but the message it gives is worth the time of seeing it. Rent this movie if you missed it in the theater.",
172,19 August 2015,anaconda-40658,7, The Iron Heart.,"The Iron Giant (1999): Dir: Brad Bird / Voices: Harry Connick Jr., Jennifer Aniston, Christopher McDonald, Vin Diesel, Eli Marienthal: Delightful animation for children with a title that seems to symbolize the junk yard owned by one character who creates art out of it. In this case the supernatural character has a heart. Premise is one of those boy meets robot themes where a giant robot falls to earth and is befriended by a boy but a government agent wishes to destroy it. To prevent that from happening the boy seeks help from a junk yard owner named Dean. The giant feeds on metal so the location would be perfect for hiding. Flourishing and heart warming with directing by Brad Bird. Voice talents include Harry Connick Jr. as the voice of Dean who finds art within the ugly. We know where he ends up but the character is unique in his point of view. Unfortunately Jennifer Aniston as the boy's mother who is too busy for her son, is never interesting. Christopher McDonald as the agent villain bypasses formula with hilarious pratfalls. Vin Diesel voices the gentle Iron Giant himself who goes through predictable friendship elements before a great climatic sacrifice that ends with a wink. Finally Eli Marienthal voices the curious boy who accepts and befriends this robotic companion. Strong theme regarding friendship and heroism that should be great lessons for the target audience.

176,12 April 2021,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, Gentle giant.,"'The Iron Giant (1999)' focuses on the friendship between a young boy and a giant machine after the latter crash-lands near the former's small town. Arriving from an unknown place at a time filled with post-war fear means that most people immediately fear the giant, even though he's as friendly as can be thanks to a bump on the noggin and a heavy dose of electricity. It isn't just his initial trauma that keeps him kind, though; it's the teachings of our protagonist, who firmly instils a sense of self in the being and tells him that killing is wrong. The first half of the flick is basically about the blossoming relationship between its two leads, which is charming and well-paced. The second introduces some resonant themes - regarding choice, discrimination and, even, what it means to have a soul - and brings its antagonist, a selfish and nationalistic government agent, further to the forefront. This all builds to an effective finale that successfully pushes the movie's message of tolerance and the ability to choose who you are. Its final emotional punch really is as impactful as its reputation would have you believe. In general, the film doesn't seem as though it panders to kids at all; it tells a relatively grown-up story that should appeal to all members of the family. It's a beautifully animated adventure with a giant heart at its core. 7/10.",

196,8 April 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9, The Iron Giant is not as cold as the title would lead you to believe.,"I remember watching this when it first came out on DVD, I was about 6 years old. To a child, this is a story about a colossal robot wanting to use his powers for good. Nearly twenty years later as I enter adulthood, I view this film completely differently. A story about loneliness, a young boy confiding in the titular character in a bid to teach him his ideologies of anti-warfare. A governmental agency concerned for the welfare and security of their own country, viewing the giant as a weapon from another nation. I cannot emphasise enough how rare it is to find such a multi-dimensional family animation that tells a different story dependent on your own perspective. Bird's directorial debut is a statement and certainly a landmark in the animation genre, garnering a cult status where the giant is often the centre of several pop cultural references ('Ready Player One' anyone?). The steampunk aesthetic appeal, CGI on top of hand-drawn animation and surprisingly dark themes has resulted in a flick that has aged impeccably well. Incredibly minimalistic in its storytelling, particularly the deer death scene, yet utterly powerful. The characters themselves were brimming with personality, from the mischievous boy to his worrying mother, they all brought the pictures to life accompanied by an intelligent screenplay. Voice acting was pretty special also, boasting an A-List cast including Aniston and the deep sounds of Diesel. The pacing was pretty much perfect, quickest hour and a half you'll experience. Let's talk about that heartbreaking ending...perfection. It took everything that the film symbolised and placed them all into one powerful scene. Everything from the themes, metaphors and ideologies. Boom. That scene. It defines the film. Whilst I would've preferred they removed the final minute, it is a family film so I'll let it slide. What I can confidently say is that The Iron Giant is a timeless thematic classic that hasn't shown any signs of rust just yet. One of the most impressive directorial debuts.",

Here Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jr) is the human friend that hangs out with adolescent Hogarth, much as Connick did in Little Man Tate. Already that's a fine idea for a movie. As in other Brad Bird movies, the value of friendship is the whole show here. I'm completely open to that message. But bigger than any big brother, is the 100 foot tall Robot. Before there was Michael Bay's Transformers, there was this giant, retro, CGI robot. The giant is a simple soul who is perfectly sweet until hidden wires are tripped.

In 1999 WB got out of feature animation for a while, after that disastrous ""Quest for Camelot"" misfire. An ambitious feature based on the book ""The Iron Giant"". This property had legs, and could have been a series if handled properly--it wasn't. It was a financial success, however. Intentionally set in the early 1950's around the time of such wonderful nonsense as ""War of the Worlds"", ""Invaders From Mars"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". A young boy finds a giant robot and at first nobody believes him. The original purpose of it was to conquer planets, as it has laser beams and sonic rays, like all good giant monsters, but all it really wants to be is friendly, like Superman. It eats scrap metal, not people. A paranoid government agent sees it as a threat to all Mankind, and an Army General and troops are sent to destroy it, of course. In the wrong hands, this would have been a terrible film, but along the way, we are treated to good, early CGI animation and a slightly-preachful storyline about ""being what you want to be"". Mild violence (""Bambi"" dies) and cuss-words: ""Hell"" used is few times. Make this inappropriate for very young kids, but otherwise quite acceptable. Your 8 to 10 year-old will love it!

214,31 March 2015,brchthethird,9, A poignant and message-driven film that will appeal to all ages,"One of the many struggles that filmmakers run into when making a children's film is creating something that appeals to both the children and their parents, who will most likely be watching it with them. THE IRON GIANT is an example of one that completely succeeds in that area. While children (particularly boys) will appreciate the friendship of a boy with a giant robot, Brad Bird also manages to send up the Cold War era and provides a strong anti-gun message. For someone's debut film, I thought it was particularly impressive considering this is the same guy who would later make THE INCREDIBLES and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL. He shows a firm directorial hand and gets excellent voice performances from the talent involved. It also helps that the story is very streamlined, so there aren't any pacing issues. The story also takes a rather poignant turn in the end that is completely earned. If I had to pick a single favorite moment from the film, it would probably be the end. Overall, THE IRON GIANT is a touching children's film with a heavy dose of nostalgia for a simpler time. This is a great film that can be enjoyed by parents and children alike.",

It does make changes to the original story but this creates a separate tale which can stand on its own. Its very entertaining, with jokes for kids and adults. Featuring excellent voice acting, a strong plot with good pacing. The animation, using the more traditional approach, is impressive and most importantly adds to the story instead of becoming the story. The ending will make you get that tingly feeling that I believe tells you that the emotional story is effective. If you are a fan of the book you have nothing to lose, if you like the story, you win and if you don't well the book's still there. Oh and its Vin Diesel's best film to date.",
220,11 March 2005,Ariamus,9, The best American animated feature of the last 20 years,"Since the release of The Little Mermaid in 1989, Walt Disney Pictures has produced a cavalcade of animated masterpiece after animated masterpiece. That movie's success and the subsequent efforts from the same studio ushered in a renaissance of American animation. Megalomaniacal visionary Steve Jobs' belief in a small computer graphics studio, Pixar was directly responsible for the birth of the computer animation feature movie. Their list of accomplishments reads like a who's who and gave impetus to other creative forces to do the same. Since the seminal Toy Story, DreamWorks and Fox, among others, have followed Pixar's lead in that genre of animation. Yet, given Disney's pedigree and Pixar's mastery, one would be incredulous to learn that the best American-made animated movie of the last 20 years was directed by a virtual unknown (at the time) and was distributed (if you can call it that) by Warner Brothers and not any of the aforementioned masters of the art. That movie is the Iron Giant.",

Much like this year's other great underdog, the Sixth Sense, the Iron Giant truly comes out of nowhere in a once commercialized or stupidized genre.  And both have similar storylines, namely about a boy who has something very special about him. In the film, young Hogarth Hughes of Rockwell, Maine, finds a giant robot in the woods behind his house.  With the robot apparently having lost his memory from a bump on his head, he befriends young Hogarth....actually, Hogarth befriends him. As most reviews have stated, there are no stupid Disney-used traits at all in this film.  NO dumb sidekicks, no stupid songs, and excellent characters, including the Giant himself.  Hogarth, his mother, and the rest, all feel and act like they should from their respective backgrounds.  So no one here is exceptionally heroic, or sarcastic. I have endless praise for this film.  It is bold and grand in every aspect.  It is my favorite film of all time, tied with the Matrix and South Park: Bigger, Longer, And Uncut. And on one last note, it would be a tragedy if this fine film is overlooked by other underdogs from this year such as the Sixth Sense and....well, so far, these are the only 2 movies this year that I have seen (with the possible exceptions of south park and the matrix) that deserve to be nominated this year.",

He has no barriers, because his imagination can take him anywhere... And the same goes for Brad Bird, the director of this animation epic that can thrill you, like in the confrontation between the Giant and the Army or touch you deep inside your heart...

An animated flick with no musical numbers, no cute little animal sidekicks, blood, and a couple ""damn""s, ""hell""s and even a ""screw""?  Overall, I think it worked fairly well.  Nice animation, retro-design characters, simple but sophisticated plot, and just the right touch of visual humor, e.g. the robot mimicking the child's postures, the detached hand running amok through the house, etc.  Ignore the preachy anti-gun message (which was, by the way, lost on the younger kids in the audience - my four year old thought the iron giant was cool because ""he had all those guns that could blow up tanks""), and you have yourself one very entertaining movie.  Maybe they could have made the moral more reasonable, i.e. ""gun's can be good if used defensively"", but I guess that would have (** spoiler alert!! **) made the ending far less dramatic -  a blast from one of the robot's lasers would probably have sufficed.",

The Iron Giant is a great entertaining movie, however there are some deep emotions and thinks in it. It's more adventures than Finding Nemo, more funny than The Incredibles, deeper than The Lion King, the recall of the Cold War feeling is brilliant, and the final action-scene is...

Here we have an intelligent, and entertaining film about a boy who befriends a giant robot from origins unknown.   The characters are not dumbed down in anyway, and there is no need to break out into song as many recent animated films have done.  We are carried along by the story and the curiosity about what will happen next to Hogarth and his giant friend.   One of the best sequences in the film is toward the end when the Giant and Hogarth are knocked out of the sky. Once they land, the Giant shows more emotion and range than many living actors can muster. The result is a scene that's full of power and emotion.  The climax of the film is fitting, but I can't say what it is, you have to see it for yourself.  A great film to show to the entire family.",

He meets an enormous, child-like robot from outer space who may or may not be a danger to the people of earth. The actors voicing the characters are all great (especially Harry Connick, Jr. as a Beatnik scrap metal dealer), the story is very touching, and the film incorporates just enough reminders of '50s Red-scare paranoia and sci-fi influences without letting them overwhelm the story.

Its got the adventure any kid would wish, and the serious moments that leave goosebumps on your skin.

Heck, it even makes me like the 1950s, arguably the dullest, most white-washed decade of the 20th century.",
279,28 February 2015,noxeniv,9, A rare gem,"The Iron Giant is one of the few animated movies that isn't directly meant for kids. The film, as a whole, is more between the lines of being mature and young. Being in between these lines is what makes the movie more unique. It had a charm while, at the same time, also had subtly dark moments which children may see as odd but an older audience may understand better. ",
280,2 February 2000,Marty L.,10," Brilliant, Touching Tale","Can it be that the best film of 1999 is....a CARTOON?  I would have to say yes.  This is perhaps the best animated feature in the past 10 years (or maybe even further back than that.)  What makes it so great?  First of all, it is a visual marvel.  The film contained some of the smoothest animation ever, with CG elements flawlessly incorporated into the traditional elements.  Vibrant colors and wonderfully expressive characters make the movie much more than a cartoon - it is merely animated life. 	The story is a gem.  The hypothetical question ""what if a gun had a soul?"" lies at the heart of the plot, and issues, of spirituality, redemption, and sacrifice make the plot much more substantive than anything Disney churns out to make a quick buck.  There are parts where I actually teared up.  Yes, I admit it, a strapping young man such as myself actually cries at films if they deserve it, and this one does.  The fact that very few people actually saw this film is very upsetting to me.  It is the perfect movie for parents to take their children to, because not only will their children be wildly entertained by the endearing, larger-than-life title character, but they as parents will also enjoy a rich movie experience - thanks to a script which pokes fun at Cold War hysteria and propaganda, among other things. 	This review might ramble, but let's wrap it up like this:  This is a fabulous movie for the young and old.  If you are a parent, PLEASE show this movie to your children.  And if you don't have kids, watch it for yourself. You won't regret it.",

The heart of animation is not cheekiness--it is a stylized reality, something we are in danger of losing with the current trend of photo-realistic computer animation and digital ""film"" (though the Final Fantasy trailers show that there are some in the CGI field that still believe in creating fantastic shots, even if the early dialogue screams Titan A.E.).",

294,31 January 2020,Tanbalarai,8, There are too many similar works,"Replaced the basic Steven Spielberg ET with a robot. The movie fans of the past may not have felt so good looking at this movie just like me. Or you may have been impressed to think that ET was remodeled like this. Or maybe you didn't notice anything. Also, when I was a child, I watched a special-effects robot hero called ""Majin Bander"". Last was the same. The part that the child works on the bed feels like I have watched about 100 times in a movie. I would like the writers to think a little about these places themself and try to devise rare ideas. It was like a movie made up of episodes of past movies.
The story composition was good. The sequence that robot and the boy talked was pulled as much as possible and the action came at the end. I have to praise that place. When I thought about it, I found out that this writer has written the 'incredible family' and is currently very successful in Hollywood. It is said that his annual income is over $ 6 million. That's fine. I wrote something a bit tough, but in modern times it is inevitable to resemble other works. This is a good film.",

It tells the story of a giant, amnesiac robot who falls to Earth, and is eventually befriended by a local boy, Hogarth Hughes. Hogarth must hide the robot from a paranoid government agent who suspects it a Soviet weapon of war. The truth is that the robot is indeed essentially a giant gun, but hails from a distant planet and bears unbelievable firepower! Ultimately, it is the friendship with the boy that brings out the robot's compassion and humanity, and saves the town from annihilation.",

I can't explain it, but there was this overwhelming feeling of nostalgia as I watched it. It left me with this bittersweet feeling. I felt loss and sorrow, but it wasn't a negative feeling. It was like having touched the most fragile parts of humanity and realizing those were your parts. I think the feelings were amplified for the time period than the actual content of the movie. It's funny since my parents were just born in the 40s and I wasn't even around. I thought the most touching part was the homage to superman. I thought it was interesting that this alien's desire to emulate a fictional alien made him more human. It was because Superman has always embodied all the very traits that as humans we strive to posess. His desire to be like Superman meant he yearned to be good, although programmed only to do harm.

Most animated movies that are released here are family viewing aimed more at the children then the adults, enough show tunes and comic relief to keep the kids involved and little enough to keep the adults involved.  I too can enjoy a Disney movie but probably wouldn't be able to sit through a marathon of them.  The Iron Giant was different.  The language was harsher then a lot of cartoons but nothing that wouldn't be aired on TV, this didn't shock me but I watch a lot of animated films where this stuff is nothing compared to what I've heard said in them.  The animation is nice and smooth, and the characters act realistic enough.  Most of the humor wasn't very deep but still made me laugh in many scenes.  One of the things I didn't like about this movie was then fact that the antiwar message was imposed a little to strong around the end.  Also showing that the films that tell you to duck and cover during a nuclear attack will have no chance of protecting you.  Still it's overall a good movie and would recommend it to anyone.",

It does not have a plethora of sound-alike songs written by a big name in sound-alike songwriting, instead it has a pleasant background of songs true to the setting.  It does  not have the ""Disney Romance,"" a major relief.  Most importantly, The Iron Giant does not talk down to its audience.  The characters had multiple dimensions to their personalities, a feature rarely given to animated characters, details of real people (note Hogarth's crooked tooth), and even *gasp* realistic dialogue.

322,12 November 2018,buih-47731,9, 10/10!,"Once in a lifetime you'll come across a film that truly captures the history and cultural distinctions of the modern world the way a person can subjectively perceive it through our guided field of perspective. I have to admit, I had my doubts when I first learned of the movie. After all, The Iron Giant? Will this movie even be good? How ignorant was I to even have these thoughts. Little did I know I was about to indulge in what may have been the best 2 hours and 21 minutes of my life. The movie started out strong. The opening scenes enticed the audience with a captivating enigma. I was so taken aback from the next-generation animation that I almost didn't even realize the underlying symbolism in the ongoing scenes. It wasn't until my twenty sixth viewing of the movie where I finally got my bearings together and was able to focus on the gripping and labyrinthine stratagem. The underlying analogy for 19th century distopianism and the evangelical deviation of typical orthodoxy was enlightening to say the least. Just when I thought the movie could not get any better, the increasing conflict before the climax began. I could not believe the complexity of the story as the main bee protagonist, Bellza, struggled with the everyday endeavors for a quintessential bee such as the consistent up- hill altercation of the fight against misogyny and the fiscal synergy of opposing interplanetary dynamisms. There I was, gripping to my chair as the conflict of the movie began. I was so enticed by the movie that I felt as if I was both practically and relatively apart of the movie. This is a special kind of high that not even the strongest of drugs can give you. Was I part of the movie? Am I inside the movie right now? This movie will leave you questioning existential nihilism and the objective skepticism of our perceived valuation of anthropological existence. At this point in the film, I was fully intoxicated by the avant-garde animated art style. That's when the plot finally aggrandized and I was completely stupefied. You could have lived a thousand years of isolation trying to predict the plot twist and you would never even scratch the surface of what actually transpires in the movie. I was so bewildered that I actually had to pause the movie so that my existential crisis didn't dive too deep inside of myself. Even pausing the movie was surreal. It's almost as if life paused with the movie. I felt as though I had actually become a cinematic tangent quantum. The effects are still wearing off and I haven't been able to watch the movie in several years. I spent the following seven years afraid of what outside of my house actually looks like. Every single day and night I live in misery because I became fully aware that happiness is never achievable. I realized that human life has absolutely no meaning and that no matter what I ever do, it is of complete unimportance and in years from now, no recollection of my existence will prevail, meaning that if I died years ago, died now, or die sometime in the future it will not matter whatsoever to anyone. But, then again, the fact that I'm living doesn't matter either so I might as well stick around for awhile, living in complete isolation, condemned to a life of traumatic memories and a completely corrupted sub-conscience. The Iron Giant literally ruined my life. 10/10",

Very contrary to my belief, I found The Iron Giant to be an incredible tale of friendship and love. It's not one of those sappy little kid movies...it really has meaning to it. Eli Marienthal was an excellent choice for the voice of Hogarth, also, and who knew that Vin Diesel could sound like a robot? I can't tell how many times I've watched this movie with my little brother now...it has to be on of the best animated movies ever created. It can get one very emotional also...::sigh:: I almost cried when the robot quoted Hogarth and went to stop the bomb. Well, not too much time is left for me here, so I might as well wrap it up with a question:",

That is, it could've been done live action, but it wouldn't have worked as well as it does as a cartoon.  This movie is absolutely amazing.  I urge everybody who hasn't seen it to go see it immediately.  Probably the most moving film I've ever seen.  The ending ranks right up there with the endings of ""Sling Blade"" and ""One False Move"" for pure emotional power.  When the movie ended, I looked around and saw people everywhere in the audience dabbing their eyes.  On the way out of the theater, a father and his six year old son walked hand in hand.  The father was using his other hand to wipe tears from his cheeks.  That in itself speaks volumes for this movie.  Despite this being animation, it's a film for everybody.  And I don't mean that in a ""this is a film for the whole family"" kinda way.  You don't even have to HAVE a family to enjoy this one. I'm shocked by The Iron Giant.  Just an insanely beautiful film.  Funny, sad, everything.... I gave it a 10.",

This is what ""The Iron Giant"" was like for me.  This movie is made for all of us 20-something animation junkies who have been caving an intelligent, fun, emotional trip to another era.  Parents who take their children to see this masterpiece will get so much more out of it than the tykes will.  I think people who remember the early stages of the cold war (which I don't, I wasn't around yet) will watch this film with a nostalgic eye, while those of us who remember the last stages of the Vietnam War will see analogies to the anti-war sentiment of the time.  Their are many metaphors spread throughout the course of the film, giving everyone something relevant to the era of their upbringing.  Do yourself a favor, and catch this one at a later showing, you'll want to avoid all of the kiddies who's parents are too rude to keep quiet...then take your favorite niece or nephew to a matinee (but be kind enough to make them view the film respectfully and quietly).",

A clever mix of C-G animation and traditional Warner Bros style animation makes for an impressive look on screen. Great voice characters by all the cast ( but I think Harry Connick Jr steals the show as ""Mr Cool"" Dean McCoppin ). Best of all it has a great story-line and snappy dialogue.

I am not going to bother repeating the same accolades which people before me have posted, all I will say is that The Iron Giant is unlike any animated film I have ever seen, and it deserves the attention of even the most mature and jaded of movie-goers!

351,22 January 2000,AaronB-2,10, Beyond the animation standards,"Animation today seems to be focused on grabbing the attention of both children and adults.  The fact is most kids going to see a movie are going to see it with their parents, so it makes sense.  There are pop culture references, and jokes strewn about movies that fly over the kids heads, but keep the adults entertained while struggling through the movie.  But as of late I've found that all the kids get out of the movie is funny looking characters doing funny looking things, and all of the dialogue is centered on the adults.  The reason for this is the idea that kids don't get it. Some movie makers think that movies with adult themes will be too much for the child, and in turn stupify the movie.  Once this is done they have to fill it up with silly references and jokes that the parents will like.  The end result is a less than entertaining film.  Then there are the movies that say ""screw it all"" and actually focus on making a good animated feature. The Secret of Nimb and The Black Cauldron, and now The Iron Giant are each excellent examples of this.  The makers of these movies give the kids a chance to get what the movie is trying to say, and the kids do.  The political undertones of the Iron Giant may not be something that the kids will relate to and say ""oh look, a cold war metaphore"" but they understand the story and plot, possibly better than those who see what this is all based on. Too add to everything, the animation in this film is fantastic.  Great film all around.",

Even coming back to it as an adult it is a great book that engages you emotionally and spiritually. The movie starts the same but becomes completely different about half-way through, which is usually a recipe for disaster.  However, in this case they have updated the story for our times and, if possible, maybe even made it better.  Get this out for your children and watch it with them.",

That's where young Hogarth Hughes finds him.Hogarth is a 9-year-old who lives with his single mom (Jennifer Aniston) and dreams of having a pet. She says they make too much of a mess around the house, little dreaming what a 100-foot robot can get up to. One night Hogarth discovers their TV antenna is missing and follows the Iron Giant's trail to the power plant, where he saves the robot from electrocution after it chomps on some live wires.

395,7 August 1999,djsmall,10, A Film Gem,"Once in a great while a movie is released that reminds filmgoers just how powerful the medium can be.  ""The Iron Giant"" is one such film.  The fact that it is animated only adds to its magic.  The animation is absolutely superb, strongly rivaling Disney's best.  The screenplay is wonderful, all of the characters are incredibly three-dimensional (something which, alas, I have a difficult time saying about the most recent Disney films), and the voice-over acting is simply the best ever.  The young boy who voiced the character of Hogarth Hughes is a true talent - his voice coupled with Hogarth's animator's drawing prowess gives the audience the best depiction of a young person ever.  Hogarth is very honest and real-to-life, from his innocent romping and make-believe sessions to his deepest and most heartfelt emotions; at no point in the film does director Brad Bird patronize youth. Hogarth is unabashedly human and not a ""boy as he should be"" caricature. Not since Elliot in ""E.T."" has a young character been so real.",

400,5 October 1999,Spanky-45,10, hello Disney,"Although parents didn't wake up to the fact, warner brothers has created the best American non-musical animated film ever. It is easily on par with Disneys best and succeeds to do what Disney does not; Tell a different story that is smart and effective.  There are no stupid talking animals, no mindless sing alongs and the story manages to get children to do more than want to go and buy the new Tarzan Swing-along alarm clock-phone-thing. I saw the film with many children in the theater, the ending made them cry and then cheer.  The children bonded with the robot and the boy and even the villain in 85 minutes.  It was as an amazing site as the film itself. Thank you Mr. Bird, I can't wait to see what you do next",
401,4 September 2000,Tarlonniel,8, Somewhat cliched but extremely worthwhile,"Well, this movie had a lot of cliches - a dangerously insane government agent, irrationally violent military men, evil hunters killing innocent woodland creatures, etc. - and Hollywood's standard anti-gun rhetoric, but otherwise this is a wonderful movie, with a quite non-cliched ending.

403,7 December 1999,GDC,10, Another ignored classic,"One of the most frustrating things about Disney's stranglehold on the animation industry is that when a truly great animated film does come along, fans ignore it in droves.  Such a case is The Iron Giant. Many people are blaming its poor showing on Warner Bros lack of advertising, which is ridiculous. I dislike the idea that unless we're inundated with Happy Meal tie-ins and action figures, the film is under-advertised. There certainly was adequate advertising for this film; it simply wasn't in titanic Disney proportions.",

The characters were very real, despite them being animated (and who says animation isn't as valid as live-action...I argue that it can surpass live-action) and all, including the Giant, were lovable.  It doesn't preach anything to the viewer, either.  I also like how the movie combined classic design/animation with high-tech visual effects of the movie.  Superb.

When I first heard of it I thought: ""Well it's just another cartoon..."" Well...it is a cartoon, but also unique. Because first we have great animations, which of cause is a plus, but then we have the theme about the friendship between the boy and the giant, which makes it wonderful. And the fact that its not just a cute traditional cartoon makes it in to my top-twenty movies. (And I've seen a lot of movies...) But the reason that is so great is that it is simply hilarious. It has so many funny moments, so you want to see it again when it has finished. So what I am trying to say is; watch if you haven't, and if you have; then watch it again!",

It's not sappy or corny, it doesn't talk down to its audience and it feels like a ""real"" movie.  I forget that I'm watching a cartoon when I watch this movie, and that's definitely a big part of why it's one of 1999's very best films.  The animation is simple but beautiful, the characters are charming, the voice characterizations are fantastic (especially Christopher McDonald as Mansley and Harry Connick as McCoppin) and Michael Kamen's score is a revelation. ""The Iron Giant"" is a first-class piece of filmmaking.",

On the whole, the quality of Hollywood films have been on a huge downturn.  Huge, loud blockbuster films that are empty and boring.  But here's a Warner Bros. animated film that has heart, style, and all the right ingredients to become a classic.  It's already been compared to E.T. (lonely boy finds and takes care of alien), but this is no melodramatic sentimental Spielberg film.  This is fun!  Sure the kids will like it, but I bet I enjoyed it more than any of the kids in the theater.  One of the best animated films ever, and yes, more fun than Star Wars:  Episode 1.  Don't miss it.",

As I started to watch I was thinking oh well another cheesy scifi cartoon but, as I got into it I noticed little things that made it different from other movies of the like. As in the simple way Hogarth goes through a daily routine and as a child of the 50's I was taken by the way things in his life were similar to mine. Only one parent, dreams of a being from outer space coming to earth and being his only friend and influence. Being the center of attention as an only child. The Giant and his way of getting inside of you and wanting him to be only yours. A true friend to be sure. I was swept up in this film in about 10 minutes. I was Hogarth. I felt everything he felt. I was taken with how the animators came up with the different weapons at his disposal, and that the Giant was basically a peaceful soul thrown into a situation he didn't ask for. Once attacked, buddy look out! I WANT A SEQUEL!!",
423,8 August 1999,Goldmund-3,10, High-water mark for animated films,"Simply put, this is the finest animated film I've seen.  Hell, this is almost a perfect movie.  Everyone employed at Disney should be forced to watch this film and rediscover what it is to create a film with real soul and emotion.  The characters in this film (especially Hogarth) truly came to life up on the screen.  The voice acting for all parts was superb. Hogarth is the first ""child actor"" that hasn't annoyed me in any way for quite some time.  While the moral message may be too heavy handed for some, this is simply a milestone film that shouldn't be passed up.",

Yes, I'm including those made by Disney too. Now, I love Disney movies, don't get me wrong, but this movie has a different quality to it. Instead of having song-and-dance numbers, or slap-stick animal characters, it's just a movie. It's like a normal live-action type movie, but everything is drawn instead. I love the medium of animation, because you can do so much with it. The special effects blended much better with the hand-drawn animation in this movie, then I've seen anywhere else. In many recent animated movies, it seems like the characters are drawn into a background where they don't belong, or even fit in. This movie has restored my faith in Warner Brothers Animation. The story was wonderful, the voice artistry wasn't over-done, and the animation was nearly flawless. This movie is definitely one that everyone can enjoy without feeling as if they're watching a ""kiddie"" movie. What are you waiting for? Go see it before it's gone!",

But this is not a review of ""Tarzan"".

It may have changed the way people see the animation genre, but it offers only little. The story itself may not have enough imagination to carry on this movie. Dirty, useless, non-unique are the words to describe its animation. These are the lows of this film but there is more. The highs for the Iron Giant comes to its script and voice acting, but this may also be its weaknesses. It is not too great, it is not too good. But the Iron Giant is a very good sci-fi film, its about a robot helping this boy, it is really a good plot. Unfortunately, the film does not depict this kind of genre, it slows to a kiddie PG cartoon, that's why I did not like this film. There are better films like Shrek, but I advise you do not watch this film. I give this film a 2/10.",

432,16 August 1999,JWR,10, A Giant Classic!,"I have been dumbstruck by the lack of attention this gem of a movie has been getting.  It is easily the best animated movie I have seen since Beauty and the Beast and the best movie I have seen this year.  It accomplishes this by setting out on a different trek from Disney.  The story is kept moving along without the now obligatory song and dance routines and goofy sidekicks perfected by the Mouse.  Instead the animators rely on a carefully crafted script and characterization.  The main morals of the movie are ""You are what you choose to be"" and an anti-violence message that seem particularly pertinant in this year of classroom horrors.  As the director Brad Bird has said ""what if a gun had a soul and chose not to be a gun.""  Overall, a stirring and timely classic that will stay with viewers long after they have left the theatre.  I dare say, worthy of Oscar recognition for best picture of the year.  Not to be missed!",

It even has a message or two.  It's pitched to the younger set, but adults will enjoy the cold war jokes (the film is set around 1960).  Good characters, especially the robot; a very good mix of laughs, pathos, and explosions.  The animation is Disney-like, blending in computerized effects seamlessly.  The mix of art styles is interesting:  the giant robot is art deco; one character (Dean the beatnik scrap dealer) looks like he came from Eightball; the rest look like they came from The Little Mermaid.",

The robot and the boy soon formed an unlikely friendship which was very sweet . Hogarth taught the robot words and different meanings of things and the robot started to show that it has feelings .

I don't cry easily during movies but I could not help myself with this one.  The relationship during the idealic 1950's between the boy and his pet robot was truly the best piece of script writing to come along since ET.  This movie is a must see not only for children who it is intended for but for adults who have lost the imagination of children, this movie will take you back.",
460,30 December 1999,reko.nokkanen,9, Caught me totally by surprise and was great!,"I bought the DVD without any knowledge about the plot other than it had a giant robot and a boy in it. ""duh"". The film just completely caught me off-guard and it was absolutely great. There were no disney-like ""let's all sing and praise"" moments and it was completely believable + the voice actors did a great job. Although the film is a bit short it still packs in everything it needs and the end is very touching.",

462,9 August 1999,filgate,10, A Wonderful Movie that doesn't deserve to fail,"Unlike the animated bombs that Warner Brothers has released over the last two years, the Iron Giant does not deserve to fail. Unfortunately, it seems that Warner Brothers thought that it would, and therefore didn't put any effort into promotion. I saw the film the day that it came out, and I was so taken with it that I had to have a memento of some kind. But there was nothing. No books, no toys, no posters. Except for an advertising campaign that seems to have peaked two weeks ago, publicity has been almost zilch.",

465,1 July 2016,meechbeach,10, This was the best movie I have seen in ages!!,"I thought this movie showed trust, friendship and help. The Iron Giant touched my heart. I even cried. The music was delightful. Especially at the end, when the Iron Man decides to save the world as Superman. The way how Hogarth said things like ""I go, you stay, stop following me"" or ""You can be what you want to be"" we're repeated which really made me cry. The Iron Giant said that in a sad way. The animation was beautiful. The Iron Giant just wanted peace. Hogarth really was like me, just younger. Dean was helpful and nice, though he wasn't showed in the movie enough! Hogarth's mum, Annie, was a lady who cared for her child. I loved this movie.",
466,25 August 2002,bigdog5610,9, My Favorite Animated movie ever!,"Animated films are normally inhabited by cutesy animals, or quirky, irresponsible humans.  Not this film.

467,2 September 2016,fattburger,9, Worth 90 minutes of anyone's time . . .,"This is simply a fabulous film. I have watched it several times, with and without kids around. I always get misty-eyed at the end (and I'm a totally unreconstructed European male of mature years).",
468,2 March 2002,sykoraggs,9, One of the greatest American animated films ever,"i loved this movie.  great story.  great insight into humanity and characterizations.  great artistic style.  The only reason i gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is because i honestly think that this film would have had a deeper meaning and more impact if the iron giant stayed dead in the end.  not that i hated his character, rather i think the giant was a great character.  the giant is actually one of the purest and most genuine of characters.  i wouldnt want him dead in real life, but hey this is a movie with deep overtones of social duty and tolerance (also a very fun and entertaining movie too!).  the giant's sacrifice has the potential to bring out the best in all of us, but his rebirth invalidates all that.  his rebirth just lowers the film back to the status of a simple kiddie flick where everything just ends up being good.",
469,21 January 2012,wrightmt,10, Wonderful! An animated classic.,"A truly enchanting film that has so much to offer. From it's witty but gentle lampooning of 1950's cold war hysteria. To it's classic looking animation style, which brings to mind story books and Disney films of years past. It's snappy pace and careful script mean that it's likely to hold the attention of it's younger viewers. ",

For the first time in years I actually cried at a movie. For the first time in years I've actually cared about the characters in a movie. The line ""I am Superman.."" still brings tears to my eyes. As all the other reviewers have said before you *must* see this movie. You will want to own it once it comes out on home video. A classic in every sense of the word. Disney needs to learn a lesson.",
472,2 August 1999,drue,9, Finally we seen a reprieve to the Disney monopoly of GOOD animated movies.,"Finally we seen a reprieve to the Disney monopoly of GOOD animated movies. Where others have tried and failed, Warner Bros. has found the right mix of great animation, a very good blend of adult and children humor, and a engaging story and NO SONG AND DANCE ROUTINES!!!  In the past WB has slid past Disney with all our favorite cartoon character, Bugs, now they sneak past them again. This will be a classic I guarantee.",
473,16 August 1999,woodwork-2,8," A real treat.Well done, a good message and very entertaining","A true family movie.  My 4 & 5 year old grand daughters loved it, and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it as well.  The animated characters are generally well developed.  The animation quality is superb and the story is engaging.  It is not overly complex, nor is to too ""preachy"" in delivering its message of non-violence.  I feel it is a rare movie in that it works well on many levels.  If possible, see it in a theater that can properly reproduce the fine audio track which is loaded with low frequency energy.",
474,8 August 1999,teri70,10, Take the kids or go alone!!!,"This was an awesome movie!  I don't think I can say that enough.    From the trailer (which doesn't do justice to the movie) I had already decided that I'd have to endure it for an hour and a half simply because the kids wanted to see it.  Thank God for my kids, because without their insisting I would have missed the best animated movie I've seen since Toy Story.  A quarter into the movie I'd already decided to buy the movie the minute it's released on DVD. There's a lot of humor that might be lost on kids, most of it related to period satire.  However, my 4 year old son laughed throughout the movie, and afterward told me ""I'm the good giant robot, Momma"" (Do I see us buying Iron Giant Merchandise? You betcha!)  I felt that the movie was like a nostalgic trip to my own childhood.  I remember when Superman was THE hero to be, and the difference between right and wrong was clearly defined. Finally, in this day and age, who can argue with a movie that advises ""You are what you chose to be."" and with a hero who proudly proclaims, ""I am NOT a gun!""",
475,19 August 1999,bfelt,10, WB finally makes a great film and nobody knows it exists!!,"It took me two weeks to finally get out and see ""The Iron Giant"".  I had been reading internet hype and was expecting a lot from this film.  It was a fantastic film and it angers me that Warner Brothers didn't do a better job putting this film out there.  This is a gem of a picture and come Oscar time should really be considered.",

I am so captivated by the ending of this movie. Great ending, but needs a sequel, however not a cheesy one where they have to fight aliens on another planet and make it luney or anything, something that slowly reveals the origins of the giant, and how he ended up on earth and such. Also, I noticed some anti-gun feelings, but then again, would it be a good children's movie if he boy said guns are good? Give me a break. ",

480,16 July 2009,bvcsmlawson,10, The Iron Giant is a great cartoon movie,(Written by Zakiyah Azam a year 5 pupil) The Iron Giant is a great movie from the start to the end.The funniest part is when Hogorth the boy met this man called Dean and up Dean's trouser's there is a squirrel and when Hogarth asks Dean to jump into the water but Dean dozen't jump into the water the big robot dose!The happiest part is when the robot and Hogarth become friends!The saddest part is when two people kill a deer and Hogarth tells the robot it is bad to kill and when the big robot flied and hit the bomb that was about to kill everyone the robot died and everyone was saved!The scariest part is when the investigator Mr Manly threatens Hogarth that he will kill his mum if he dozen't tell him were the robot is!,
481,3 April 2000,tsh3,9, A joy from start to end,"I went in to see this film without expectations, and came away very pleasantly surprised. This enchanting family movie has all the right ingredients. It's funny, clever, well written, the characters are likeable, and there's an important message in there too. Though essentially about the relationship between the young boy and his robot friend, there are questions raised about the army, about war and the battle between good and evil.",
482,8 October 2020,empressspiritcat,9, One of the best films ever made!,"Not only is this an amazing animated movie it is an amazing movie in general! The story is pretty simple but that works because of that the characters are able to develop and the themes of anti violence and humanity are present. The giant starts out with amnesia of it's origin but over the course of the story he learns he was built for destruction, after getting electrocuted and rescued by Hogarth the robot becomes more self aware and develops a close bond with the boy. Hogarth shows him he doesn't have to be a gun he can be a hero. The movie ends with the giant sacrificing himself to save everyone from being killed by a missile. I nearly cried for the ending because it was so heavy and depressing but incredibly touching. This movie will pull your heartstrings ! Another thing is the animation is phenomenal! I cannot recommend this movie enough!",

Just watched it for the first time now, and absolutely loved it. Rather than listing out all of the things I like, I will just state the one single thing that I don't like: the very last shot. People, please stop putting fake out deaths in movies, especially when they undermine the very best scene in the movie. I'm not going to let it ruin the rest of the movie for me, but it's the reason I'm giving it a 9 instead of a 10.",

This movie is for everyone.  If you are tired of the all the Disney crap that is release every year, go see this movie, because this is the direction that American animation should take from now on.  The closest movies that I think could be used to described The Iron Giant would have to be Miyazaki's since they all take place in a reality which is not quite our own but is close enough for us to identify with it and its characters.  This a movie that every movie fan should see, because movies like this don't come around often enough.",
488,9 August 1999,raygunn,10, A classic that will be long remembered,"The Iron Giant is a truly amazing film!  I succumbed completely to the charm of this cinematic gem!  In this summer of big budget disappointments, the Iron Giant is a breath of fresh air.  The story is simple, yet compelling.

The ""big boys"" should be paying attention.",
490,1 December 1999,OnTheRd,9," Take Everyone You Know, and Even Some You Don't","This movie is phenomenal.  In an age where special effects and on-shelf marketing deals override a good story in a well crafted film, this movie proves that less is more.  This film employs intelligent humor and wonderful imagination.  This instant classic also has a terrific message for kids ages 3 and up.",

At the same time, the reviews were so enthusiastic that I was skeptical. I expected it to be, at the very least, entertaining. What I got was more than entertaining. It was truly a thing of beauty. I was sucked into, and swept away by this film, more than ever before. I have never been so emotionally affected by a movie in my entire life. While I certainly understand that not everybody will get as much out of it as I did, I know that this was one of the single best films that I have ever seen. You owe it to yourself to see this movie!",

I've never seen such emotion portrayed in the animated format! It's one thing to make drawings move realistically. Disney and others can all do that! But these guys, they made their drawings think and act! They really came to life before my eyes! I actually felt sorry for the robot! I walked out of the theater with a new perspective on life!",

I can't ever remember a film that made me want to run back to the theater ASAP and see it again. I usually don't see movies in the theater more than once, but I'll see this one at least a few more times.  Go see it! You'll love it!",
497,15 August 1999,Dr.Drake,10," Run, don't walk to see it!","The Iron Giant is without a doubt the best, most intelligent animated feature from America since Fantasia. The single best endorsement I can think of is that when I drug a friend to see it at a matinee showing last week, there a bunch of kids in the theatre directly behind us. Not only did my friend ( a 37 year old pharmacist), really enjoy it, the kids really loved it too. The story isn't ""dumbed down"" in any way, it doesn't insult an adult's ( or a kid's either) intelligence by resorting to cutesy comic sidekicks  i.e. Jar Jar Binks, Terk, or Scrappy Doo. The Iron Giant is just flat-out a good movie that happens to be animated.",
498,18 August 1999,gandl,10, praise for the best film of the year,"The Iron Giant is THE best film of the year hands down.  I haven't seen a movie that's taken me on such a ride in a VERY long time.  It never has a bad moment...and runs the gamut of emotions.  It makes you smile, laugh your butt off, sit on the edge of your seat and cry.  Simply the best of filmmaking.",
499,1 January 2000,Milo426,10," Simply put, one of the most beautiful stories ever told on film","Because it didn't raise a huge ruckus in it's theatrical release, I'm betting that almost everyone forgets ""The Iron Giant"" come Oscar time...but they shouldn't.  Oh I'm sure that it will get nominated in the Animated Feature category, but I doubt we're going to see this film's name in either of the categories where it belongs - Best Screenplay and Best Picture.  The sad thing is that this is probably more likely going to be due to a lack of an attempt on the part of Warner Brothers to push the film as a Best Picture/Screenplay nominee than on the unwillingness of the Academy to nominate it in those categories.  Warner Brothers will I'm sure make at least a token effort to outperform Disney's ""Tarzan"" marketing juggernaut, but I won't be suprised if it doesn't even occur to the powers that be to float this as a Best Picture/Screenplay contender.",

As a matter of fact i've started to value anime above the others kind of works like disney, pixar etc. But this movie... This is the perfect animation movie ever made. The humour, the emotion, pearls of wisdom, style of draw, the music... This movie has everything. This movie is everything.

Imagine you going to a place you never been before and people shoot rockets at you because they believe you are a danger to their society. Now ask your self this, If you were in the Giant's shoes would you have still sacrificed yourself? Be honest with yourself do not give an answer because you think it is what I want to hear. None the less if you have never seen this movie, please consider renting it or buying. Also sit your kid down (if you have one) and watch with him/her. It is a great movie, till this day I cry.
