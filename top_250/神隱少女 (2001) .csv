0,26 December 2013,gogoschka-1,10," Strange, touching and beautiful","Personally, I've never seen anything as original in an animated film as in this deeply mythical fairytale. What a surreal idea for a movie! It's hard to find an adequate description (because I also don't want to spoil this in the slightest way) but this film has a sense of ""otherness"" to it - for lack of a better word - like none I've ever seen. And the strange, mythical nature of this film - apart from the amazing artwork - is probably one of the main reasons for its appeal to me. ",/
1,29 December 2020,Morejambo54,7, I don't really know what to say.,"I enjoyed this movie but more towards the end. The first half of the movie was very odd, which is one of the main reasons I kept watching as I wanted to understand it but that didn't really happen. Not enough was explained and it felt like a mix of random events yet there was an actual story. Im struggling to come up with a reason of why no-face was even in the movie, he was just there. This movie isn't bad by any means, it's just lacking somethings in my opinion. I also didn't. Really feel in touch with any of the characters as no room was left for them to develop. The wired and wacky characters made the film very unique and interesting, the film is visually beautiful as well, I would personally want more depth.It is a good movie with a lot of potential. 7/10",r
2,2 April 2004,supertom-3,10, Best animated film I have seen!,This is a wonderfully imaginative and fantastical children's fantasy. It is easy to see why it was perhaps the critical hit of 2002. The film is glorious to look at. It is a testament to old fashioned animation techniques that seem to be resigned to foreign animations. Of course there is some use of computer imagery for certain shots but they blend seamlessly and the overall artistry involved is superlative.,e
3,4 November 2002,shanebuckland,10," A stunning, intoxicating, magical masterpiece.","There is simply no denying that Miyazaki is the Godfather of Japanese Animation, time and time again delivering unto the public works of such incredible beauty, such stunning visual and sensory delights, such mastery of storytelling, that one can only be left speechless. Overwhelmed. Intoxicated with wonder. Such is the magic of Spirited Away.",v
4,11 June 2007,planktonrules,9," Exceptional, but perhaps not so much for the casual viewer","I have seen many international films over the years and quite a few of these were Japanese. In addition, unlike many parents, I have seen a lot of anime that my kids have watched so at least I have some familiarity with the medium. Yet, with my background I still felt pretty confused and baffled by the strangeness of this movie. Now this isn't to say I didn't like it, but so many times I just couldn't understand exactly what was happening. Interestingly, when I saw the film again, I understood it much better and appreciated it much more. And this may be exactly how you might want to approach the film unless you already are a die-hard anime fan. See it, but be willing to see it without trying to think out the odd plot too much or even try seeing it several times. I know that each time I did, the film became more and more enjoyable and I began to notice so many cultural references. Now, several years after I first saw it in the theater, I have seen a lot more Japanese anime and films and it's practically second-nature to follow the film. So, for adults and those unfamiliar with the medium, this movie might take a bit of effort to fully enjoy, though with more and more children being familiar with and loving anime, it's very likely your kids will love it and will then be able to explain it to you!! As for the film, the animation is the best I have seen in any Miyazaki film, the story deep and fascinating and it's full of cute and endearing little touches that make the movie magical. See this with an open mind, please.",i
5,18 October 2004,Balibari,9, Dub or sub?,"Last year I saw Spirited Away on it's UK release. I've never been a particular fan of anime, and it didn't really occur to me that I was watching a foreign language film dubbed into English (or 'American'). I can't imagine seeing a live action foreign language film dubbed into another language, but hey, this is a kids cartoon, what does it matter? Up to a point it didn't, because I loved the film. I enjoyed it so much I set about digging up the Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki back catalogue, in the process Sprited Away was filed away as one of the lesser Ghibli's - still great, but compared to Laputa, Grave of the Fireflies and a few others, it seemed a little weak. ",e
6,2 May 2005,Foxbarking,10, One of the Greatest Movies Of All Time,"This movie is an outstanding piece of artwork. I hadn't heard much about it when it was first released. Being a huge Oscar fan, I was surprised when it took home the award for best animated film. At that point, knew nothing about it.",w
7,15 June 2020,elpresidente-4,5, I have no strong opinion about this movie either way,"I've been hearing good things about this movie for years and finally decided to watch it, but I didn't quite understood it. There are things that I liked, like the expressive way the main character was drawn, the overall color palette and backgrounds, maybe some points for the original setting, but with that, I can't think of what else good to say. From all the things I've heard I expected the movie to be very emotional, yet I failed to notice such thing. I had seen the black character with the mask used in memes on the internet so much, that I expected he would play a really important part in the story, but in the end he was nothing special. The story really confused me, some elements didn't make much sense to me, and the ending was pretty rushed, like they ran out of money and had to complete the movie fast. I don't know, maybe I have to study Japanese philosophy and symbolism to understand what is happening. Don't get me wrong, I kinda enjoyed the movie, I just wish it made more sense. It sort of reminded me of the movie ""labyrinth"", but that movie has a very good structure and story, and you always know what is going on and why. In conclusion, I think the movie would be appreciated more by children.",/

9,24 January 2005,Matti-Man,10, The audience is even more interesting than the film,"That ""Spirited Away"" is a masterpiece would seem to any sane person to be beyond dispute. This is the first of Miyazaki's films I've seen and had it recommended to me by a friend who's into anime. I'm really not keen on Manga at all, so I delayed seeing ""Spirited Away"" for a few months. I finally got around to seeing the subtitled version - never, never waste your time with dubbed versions of foreign movies - over the weekend and I loved every frame of it. The imagination and creativity blew me away and I'd put the film alongside other ""children's"" masterpieces like ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"", Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy and Ray Bradbury's poetic ""Something Wicked this Way Comes""..",w
10,16 March 2020,jackgdemoss,5," I can't speak for the original or sub, but the dubbed version is a bad movie","I went in expecting that this movie would have a chance of being one of my all time favorites. I couldn't have been more wrong. This is just a bad experience. The character and world design was great but the motivations and plot were snooze inducing. Take this review with a grain of salt, however, because I watched it dubbed. From what I have read, watching it dubbed completely changes the experience for whatever reason, so hopefully I can get back around to watching it correctly sometime.",1
11,25 April 2020,orialon24,4, Not for me I guess,Heard from a lot of people I should watch this movie and thought I'd like it but just couldn't get into it... forced myself to finish it and thought it's pretty boring,1
12,5 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10, Prepare to be enchanted!,"I love Studio Ghibli, and Spirited Away is one of my favourite films from the studio. This is coming from someone who was delighted by Howl's Moving Castle, blown away by Princess Mononoke, emotionally devastated by Grave of the Fireflies and touched by the simplicity of The Cat Returns all but to name a few. Spirited Away is a mystical, charming and truly enchanting animated fantasy, even with the long length and some slow moments. The animation is absolutely stunning, both the hand drawn visuals and the CGI graphics give an ethereal charm to the film. The characters move more than convincingly and the colours are beautiful. The music is also outstanding, I loved the simplicity of the piano and the drama of the more dramatic parts. The story is a pleasure, I know people have complained of some loose ends, but it is an original, touching and charming one I feel. I also loved the characters. Chihiro, voiced with real enthusiasm by Daveigh Chase, is sulky to begin with, but she is also brave and resourceful, traits I like in young heroines. Lin is kind and sympathetic, and Susan Egan who was also in Porco Rosso was unusually sensitive as the character. Jason Marsden is charming as Haku, and Suzanne Pleshette is perfect as the grotesque Yubaba and as her sister Zeniba. Overall, I loved Spirited Away, it is really charming. 10/10 Bethany Cox",0
13,12 January 2005,sailvane-1,10, I disagree with Gazzer-2,"Actually I dislike his or her comments badly. If you didn't get it watch it again. This is not a piece to just entertain, the creator has put his own feeling and I believe life experience and the fear always buried in children's mind into it. It is a comely tale that express the creator's thoughts in some way, whilst shining as a attractive animation piece with so many details that you might have ignore if you were careless. It is a rich story and I can see the efforts creators put into it in many spots and frames.",0
14,13 September 2021,kikiboo_8,6, Exactly what makes this a masterpiece?,"It's not bad. The animation is beautiful, the atmosphere is haunting and beautiful, characters are ok for the most part. Chihiro is whiny and very dramatic. Hoku is slightly on the cold side. Plot doesn't even make much sense, if any. Her parents eat a bunch of food that isn't theirs and turn into pigs. I understand that much. I'm failing to understand why or how does Yubaba have that level of authority over everyone and how she makes people forget who they used to be and keeps them stuck with her that way. That whole thing makes very little sense. Though it's undeniably fun to watch how Chihiro finds her way out of there. Along with the hint of romance between her and Hoku, but that's just kind of awkward considering she's only 10.",2

16,27 September 2003,paul_mampilly,10, Can Easily Beat Disney In Their Own Game,"As the rest of the Western world was amazed by the throngs of CGI animation, and the inside Disney jokes, Japanese audiences were given a chance to see what real animation was like. This movie was the first foreign film which grossed over 200 million dollars before it came over the US shores. It had beaten Pixar's Ice Age and Disney's Lilo and Stitch to get Best Animated Feature. Yet with all these facts and figures shown to us, does this movie live up to its hype. In a one word answer, YES!",2
17,5 October 2017,joecoby45,5, Overrated,"This is not a bad movie at all, but its really not that great either. I don't really understand what all the endless praise is over. The animation is amazing for sure but the story feels really convoluted. I don't really understand what the ghost character with the gold was. I didn't understand what he was or what we wanted exactly. Maybe i'm missing something. ",/
18,22 June 2013,BA_Harrison,3, I get the feeling that this review won't be very popular...,"As a huge fan of both animation and Japanese cinema, I have long felt more than a little embarrassed by my ignorance of celebrated director Hayao Miyazaki. Having tried to rectify this situation somewhat by watching the highly acclaimed animé Spirited Away, I no longer feel so bad about neglecting his work for so long: I found the film hugely undeserving of the glowing praise heaped upon it and I imagine it'll probably be quite a while before I tackle another of Miyazaki's 'classics'.",?
19,20 October 2015,michaelradny,6, Japanese Spirit,"The beautiful looking work of Spirited Away will catch you breathless from the get go, but sadly the story will neither entice nor enthrall you enough to stay focused on what's happening. The films story feels rather surreal and incoherent, giving no indication to what and why characters do certain actions. It also fails at being anything near original, muddling up previously used stories and creating one big jumbled mess.",r

29,15 August 2012,classicsoncall,7," ""Finish what you started, Human.""","Quite often I'll use the IMDb reviews and ratings to recommend a film, and that was the case here. With a ranking in the Top #50 as I write this I was anticipating something really special but was left somewhat disillusioned when it was all over. Probably the biggest disappointment for me was the lack of a coherent story line, or more specifically, the way the story veered off in completely different directions as if it was being written while the filming was already in progress. Story continuity seemed unimportant, one such example would be Master Haku's insistence with Chihiro that she must persist in getting a job from Kamajii the Boiler Man and refuse to take no for an answer. Failing to do so so would put her in jeopardy with Yubaba, but Kamajii simply recommends that Chihiro request a job from Yubaba directly, which she does.",v
30,21 June 2005,Juggertrout,10, The best animated film I have ever seen,"Spirited Away is my favourite Hayao Miyazi movie. It's a departure from his previous films (all of them wonderful), in the sense that this film lacks the themes so common in his other work: humans vs nature, large scale battles being the prime examples. All for the better I say, as it allows him to create something truly unique and stunning. The story revolves around Chihiro, a young girl who, on the way to her new house, stumbles into an abandoned amusement park and is soon transported into a magical world of spirits, gods and human-frog hybrids.",
31,30 March 2020,WeAreLive,10, A childhood classic,"Chihiro and her parents are moving to a small Japanese town in the countryside, much to Chihiro's dismay. On the way to their new home, Chihiro's father makes a wrong turn and drives down a lonely one-lane road which dead-ends in front of a tunnel. Her parents decide to stop the car and explore the area. They go through the tunnel and find an abandoned amusement park on the other side, with its own little town. When her parents see a restaurant with great-smelling food but no staff, they decide to eat and pay later. However, Chihiro refuses to eat and decides to explore the theme park a bit more. She meets a boy named Haku who tells her that Chihiro and her parents are in danger, and they must leave immediately. She runs to the restaurant and finds that her parents have turned into pigs. In addition, the theme park turns out to be a town inhabited by demons, spirits, and evil gods. At the center of the town is a bathhouse where these creatures go to relax. The owner of the bathhouse is the evil witch Yubaba, who is intent on keeping all trespassers as captive workers, including Chihiro.

37,28 July 2022,rtsdynamite,8, Over-Appreciated,"Spirited Away contains a great cluster of creativity. The characters and ideas are mostly original and the core design which is the main character's (Chihiro) coming of age tale, completes with satisfaction. Yet the film feels familiar. It shares the same magic that Disney's older pieces contain and it is executed with a Japanese approach which does make it different but it has the same purpose.

38,3 May 2005,pip-7,10, A Movie Where Many Childhood Dreams Are Reborn...,"It is so ironically tragic that many great movies such as Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away are often overlooked by the public, suggesting that commercialism is the way of reflecting the possibility of achieving blockbuster status in the box-office, even as if most of these recycled products receive poor reviews (remember Shark Tale? It's horribly cliché but millions of viewers still watch it). Is it because of technology that drives its influence to the public without providing any necessity that is its substance? Or is it because Spirited Away is considered another ordinary 2D cartoon that should be suitable for little children and not the rest of us? Sadly, this is reality and we all see as it is right now (providing that we live in a topsy-turvy world with unfair paradoxes) but it doesn't mean that Miyazaki's masterpiece has a chance to change our reflections on life. In fact, there are doses of good reasons on why this movie is so special to us, aside from its family-friendly context.",

40,7 September 2006,subscriptions,5, pointless and annoying,"I am baffled by how much people like this pointless and annoying movie. The protagonist is an irritating and uninteresting little girl, and the film has essentially no plot. It presents a series of weird encounters and situations, without ever a sense that it's going anywhere, and without ever showing an interesting way of dealing with them by the little girl. Rather, whatever she does happens for magical reasons to have been the right thing, giving the impression that we're watching her have one of those dreams in which she can do no wrong. For some reason people like this parade of strangeness without a plot or a likable protagonist enough to rate this film higher than Grave of the Fireflies and Princess Mononoke, excellent films that actually have great characters, compelling plots, and in the latter case, also very imaginative encounters and situations.",

Because I just wasted 2 hours of my life since I was baited into believing that a movie with an 8.6 on IMDB may actually be accurate. I really wanted to enjoy this movie, I practically forced my family to watch it with me saying that it is the highest rated animated movie of all time. My whole family wanted to quit halfway through but I told them that there had to be something at the end that carried this movie, but no, there was nothing. No emotion, no plot twist, just a ""and everyone lived happily ever after"". I can tell from the some hundred of thousands of reviews that hardly anyone will agree with me. The only points I can give this movie is that the animation is somewhat decent and that there were some funny parts, but that is it. I also get that this movie age range is mainly for kids, but even my 7 year old brother hated it. I just don't understand what people get from watching this movie, I just came out wanting to forget everything I just suffered through.

Historically, I can appreciate the beauty and artistry in all of his films, but I find that I prefer the films that center more on characters (Kiki's Delivery Service, Whispers of the Heart) as opposed to animals and nature (Mononoke Hime, Porco Rosso).

However, in terms of plot, story structure, catharsis, plant and pay off...it's all over the place.  I felt the world had no rules to it and therefore lacked any real tension.  I felt the story lacked any logic to it and therefore had no reason behind the motivation for characters.  Why did she do that? What is that supposed to be?  What was that all about? When will this end or start making sense?  With so many positive reviews and awards I'm confused.  Perhaps I just didn't get what others got from it...

There is no explanation of any happenings in the movie and all sorts of things happen surreal and otherwise and are just left to hang in the air. Pseuds would say that is the ""art"" in it. I say it's just daft and confusing for the viewer. There is little or no emotion in this endeavour either. Girl has parents turned to pigs-why? Maybe it makes more sense in the subtitled version than the dreadfully dubbed version but I doubt it very much. Another thing I hate about anime is the insistence in denying the ""Japanese-ness"" of the characters. They are drawn as westernised as any Pixar or Disney character. The only clue to its ethnic origin is the costume and backgrounds. All the kudos heaped on this tosh is a severe case of The Emperor's New Clothes. Avoid this rubbish , it is time you will never get back.",

70,18 March 2019,andrewroy-04316,7," A beautiful work of art and symbolic film, but especially the third act doesn't provide satisfying answers","Spirited Away is both a beautiful to watch animated movie and gives the viewer plenty of ideas and symbols to ponder, but the story itself and particularly its conclusions left me ready to move on. I have the utmost respect for animation studios and Studio Ghibli after watching Spirited Away. Miyazaki puts in so many small visual details that immerse you in the spirit world and make it so much more realistic. In terms of the story itself, I found it inconsistent. There are plenty of great themes and ideas to consider, the two that stood out most to me being greed vs kindness in the characters, and the older, more naturalistic mindset clashing with the materialistic, capitalistic modern mindset. Chihiro is a fun protagonist who avoids one-dimensionality, having both a multifaceted personality and an arc that significantly shows her character develop throughout.
Where the story broke down for me was in several of the plot events and details of the world. Simply put, I found the ending to be deus ex machina and an overly simplistic and easy way to solve what had seemed like big, complex challenges. I didn't buy her sudden love with Haku and the way their relationship transitioned from a caring friendship to quite committed love. I also didn't find the addition of Yubaba's twin to make any sense, she felt like a superfluous character added in as a weird twist. The way she got her parents back felt completely absurd and was when I accepted that it just isn't a great movie. In addition to these and other plot frustrations, maybe it was an intentional choice to make the spirit world feel whimsical and ambiguous, but the lack of clarity in how the world functions limited my enjoyment. Are all of them spirits? How many of them are being held there against their will (like Haku)? What is the true motivation of all the spirits? How do the spirits interact with the physical world, and how do their transformations and magical powers work? I found many underlying workings of the spirit world to be unclear in addition to plot points that were either contrived or superfluous. I definitely enjoyed watching it and I do like the consistent, immersive feel of the movie from a young girl discovering this wild world perspective, but the exposition and later plot events didn't completely satisfy me.",

72,28 March 2006,Nextwiggin,10, Advice,"I have some advice to anyone that hasn't seen this movie or did not like it but is attempting to watch it again: do not look at this movie the same way you look at western movies. This movie is meant to be a fable, and thus is chock full of metaphor. In fact, since it is set in the spirit world, EVERYthing is a metaphor. I don't want to impose my own views as to what those metaphors may mean, but it is important to accept, in a sense, that this movie doesn't have a plot. At least, not in the conventional sense. It would be better viewed as an exploration. Of what, I'll let you decide. Watch the movie, try to figure out what all the characters mean, why some are portrayed in a more favorable light and others not. It is also important to remember that, unlike western art in general, many of this movie's metaphors and messages have more than one meaning. I get the sense from reading the posts of other people, as well as some reviews, that many people have trouble realizing/accepting this. But, in my opinion, it is essential to move past this to truly enjoy and understand the movie and its message. The implication of this is also that it is impossible to fully understand the movie in just one viewing (or two, or many more). Like a painting, we are meant to look at this movie from different perspectives; close up and from far away and in different lights. All this is why I consider Spirited Away my favorite movie, and I hope that my advice will help some people see it in a different light. I don't claim to have all the necessary information to understand this movie, but rather I think I can help some people people who have trouble with this sort of movie and art enjoy it a bit more. So... have fun!",

I saw the subtitled film and (with the exception of occasional gaps & pauses in the subtitling) I judge it to be the best animation since Akira, or possibly even Pinnoccio. The storyline is (in outline) no more incredible than most anime, but the film excels because it is bursting with unusual ideas. The imaginative imagery is wedded with fine, detailed animation and evocative music. Some parts of the film (chases/drives through foliage/flowers/within the bath-house) are exceptionally detailed and visually striking. There are (thankfully few) portions of the film soundtrack that suffer an outbreak of a Richard Clayderman-esque piano composition (IMO), but generally the sound supports the animation well and the animation was continually stimulating and moving. I give this (original film with subtitles)  9 OUT OF 10.",

Basically ten-year old Chihiro (Lilo & Stitch's Daveigh Chase) is moving to a house in the suburbs with her mother (Dumb and Dumber's Lauren Holly) and father (The Shield's Michael Chiklis). They get out of the car to walk down a lonely dirt road, and end up in open country surroundings, and finding a café which the parents eat in. Chihiro wanders off, and briefly meets the mysterious Haku (Jason Marsden) who warns her to leave immediately, but she can't when she discovers her parents have become pigs, literally. Haku finds her and promises to help by by getting a job at the bathhouse working for Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette), who has a nicer twin sister Zeniba (also Pleshette) and the thousands of God and spirit customers. Chihiro does as well as she can in this strange world, but she must find a way to break her parents spell and be able to return home. Also starring Hercules' Susan Egan as Lin, David Ogden Stiers as Kamajii and John Ratzenberger as Assistant Manager. The story is a little strange, but bare in mind it is Japanese, but with good dubbing voices and aspiring animation, you'll enjoy the experience. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and it won the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language. It was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!",

The score really complimented it also. I just did not really enjoy the story. It seemed to be very jumbled and trying to get too many themes and messages across. Greed, coming of age, friendship, even environmental harm. It was just too much. I found nearly all the characters somewhat annoying apart from Haku. The young girl who was the main hero grated on me after a while. The spirit world also was confusing. It was hard to figure out who was good and bad at times and I pondered whether all the spirits were actually being held prisoner. I also thought the ending was a bit lame. Without giving away too much they introduced a character towards the end and it somehow felt only to bring the movie to a conclusion and help the young girl. I would have liked to have seen a bit more of what happened after.

Another friend said it was a coming of age and how Chihiro herself progresses throughout the film.  I mean, if you can find so much insight in a film, you know you have a great film.",

125,26 May 2003,MyOpinionIsFact,5, I really wanted to like this movie more.,"I can count on one hand the number of animated films I thought achieved the potential of the medium. I am almost always disappointed by them; so much so that I've started to actively dislike the genre. After hearing all the praise for this movie, I really, really wanted to be proved wrong. Even though I found myself admiring some of the artistry in Spirited Away, overall I felt very letdown. First, like during almost every animated film that I see, I got a bad headache while watching it (if this always happens to anybody else, please contact me). Second, the main characters look far too cartoony compared to the lavishness of the background scenes. If someone can enlighten me as to *why* animators, from an artistic point of view, not pragmatic, choose to do this, let me know. Third, why do animated characters always have to be so clumsy? Here, it was part of Sen's development, but animated characters are always dropping things, slipping here, fumbling there. Sure, it can be used to convey dynamicism to the inanimate drawings but, for me, it is at the expense of realism. Lastly, besides the most trite of statements (e.g., pollution is bad, whining is bad, gluttony is bad, greed is bad, etc.), I find the movie without a deeper message. Or, among the messages it does hold, I find none of them presented movingly enough such that offenders would change their lifestyle. I did like the music and some of the comedy. And I admit that many of the visuals will stick with me for a long time. My favorite moment (no real spoiler) is when the hamster interacts with the footprint and the sootballs. What's puzzling about this little scene is that it is completely unnecessary and even detracts from the storytelling; yet it works. I gave the movie 5/10.",

When I mean stole it, I do in fact mean stole it. Spirited Away is the kind of film that really points out what is wrong with animation today: not that much of a story, very inconsistent animation, lack of closure, and just too many slow moments. Clocking in at over two hours long, this is one of the longer animated movies to come out in recent years, and despite the few humorous moments, it isn't that great overall. Making an astonishing 200 million dollars overseas, it established Hayao Miyazaki as the ""Walt Disney of Japan.""",

139,8 May 2007,bobbie-16,8, unusual and surprising,"If you are not Japanese, definitely see this movie with the Japanese soundtrack and subtitles, not dubbed. The sound will then go with the gestures and facial expressions. The story is a great introduction to themes in Japanese culture. The words ""spirits"" and ""gods"" which are used interchangeably in the movie are translations of ""kami"" (you can see the term in the title in Japanese), which is a Shinto concept of a spirit being, not god as thought of by Jews, Christians, and Muslims (who might be offended by a ""stink god"") . Many things in nature are filled with this kind of spiritual power--rivers, winds, rocks, etc. (For example, kamikaze means ""divine wind"" and it referred originally to the two great typhoons that destroyed the Mongol fleets when they tried to invade Japan in the 1200s). As other reviewers have pointed out, the story is about Chihiro's transformation from a whiny brat to a self-reliant, courteous, compassionate and aware individual. The viewer may see a resemblance to Memoirs of a Geisha in the heroine's maturation from a frightened little girl traumatically separated from her parents to a servant who must start at the bottom of the hierarchy and finally to a self-reliant and successful person. Another theme that is similar is the character of the greedy, powerful, witch-like owner of the establishment. Yubaba is contrasted to Zeniba; the former's home is ""in bad taste"" with a lot of imported ornate stuff (from chinoiserie to western-style furnishings) whereas Zeniba's cottage is very wabi-sabi (rustic-archaic) and simple, hearkening back to traditional Japanese design. Another thing I liked about the movie was its complete acceptance of a girl-protagonist (whereas girls are often treated as ""second-best"" in American movies). Japanese gender hierarchy and women's ""submissiveness"" are not as simple as some folks think. In early Japanese history, women were very powerful and autonomous figures--politically powerful, writers, etc. Originally the society was matrilocal and women had considerable say in their personal lives. The emperor is the descendant of the sun-goddess. Women's status declined in the samurai period and the Meiji Restoration, but there are still traces of their originally higher status and importance. So Spirited Away is not only fun entertainment but also a little introduction to themes and values of Japanese culture.",
140,21 February 2008,Nearly_Headless_J,8," The older you are, the more you will love this movie...","This film works well with childrenbut works wonders with adults. Much like ""Alice In Wonderland"", it revolves around a world which appears to be extraordinary  but at the same time reflects many aspects of our own society, and the human nature. Miyazaki's quality of animation is brilliant as usual, much like his vision to create something so creatively profound, entertaining and intensely symbolic. A perfect example of the latter is an appropriately named character called No-Face. To me he appeared to be a reference to the many socially insecure people out there, who stay in the shadows but secretly crave for friendship. When Chihiro behaves in a warm manner with him, he is so overwhelmed that he becomes desperate to seek her attention and to make her happy in any way possible. Another symbolic aspect I found towards the end of the movie, was when Haku strictly told Chihiro not to ""look back"", until she had come out of the cave. This instantly reminded me of a Greek myth I had read as a child, - whereby a man who had gone to depths of Hell to bring back his dead wife, was instructed to do the same, but failed to comply due to his doubtful nature. Perhaps Miyazaki wanted to imply that by ""looking back"", Chihiro would have unknowingly expressed a hint of regret and this might have enabled Yu-Baba to seize her back into the magical land. Of course, there is also the rather abrupt ending  which I had found a bit weird at first but when I thought about it I realised that it was most probably done on purpose, to maintain an element of mystery in the viewer's mind, as to whether Chihiro and Haku were ever able to meet again or not. All said and done, I did have one complaint with the movieconsidering the story involved an extraordinary, magical land there was an enormous amount of scope and although I found the movie to be very intriguing  I feel that it could have been even more adventurous and exciting. That's just me. On the whole though, I can't deny the fact that this is one of the most unique, enthralling animation experiences I've ever had. ",

The characters are complex and there are mysteries that don't get explained in the movie, which is nice for a change. In most children's movies we get to see these days, every thing is laid out bite-sized, and nothing is left unexplained. Spirited away is much more daring in that respect.

Nevertheless, the beautiful workmanship is not only virtue of this flick as ""Spirited Away"" provides also extremely coherent plot. It occurs that Miyazaki's imagination has no limits. The main heroine is entangled in a series of unexpected events having their roots probably in the mythology. The story develops through and extensively uses the main heroine. All characters are incredibly likable, which unceasingly attracts viewer's attention.

I really love the title since it goes well with Chihiro's experience of being sent away by some sort of 'spirit' to a magical world. For some reason, I haven't seen 'Howl's Moving Castle' and I so want to see this movie because, like this movie, I am really interested in it. Okay. So, Chihiro gets into this mess because, as we could relate, her dad doesn't look for directions to their new home (the, uhh, scenic route). They enter a 'market'like place and Chihiro's parents start eating the food. Chihiro wonders off, and finds the bathhouse when who should appear but Haku, telling her to get out before it's too late, and she finds her parents turned into pigs. Haku tells her to look for a job, or she'll be sent to Yubaba, the head honcho of the whole bath house. There, her name is changed to Sen. She meets Lin, who is her roommate/helper to help her with her job. A spirit named No-face comes and starts eating customers and workers, but is really interested in Sen. She refuses, and No-face goes berserk (I think). She leaves to find Yubaba's twin sister, Zeniba. Haku (who can turn into a dragon, as he is a dragon when we see him at this part), shows up and gives Chihiro a ride back to the bath house. Along the way, Chihiro remembers a time when she thinks Haku saved her and she reveals his name, Kohaku River. She makes a deal with Yubaba, and tries to figure out which pigs out the group are her parents. She realizes that none of them are her parents. The contract she signed is ripped, and she's free. She meets her parents at the end, and looks back when they reach the end of the tunnel where their car was left. She looks back and gets into the car, ready to begin her life in her new home.

A story of a little girl thrust into a world of the unknown, because of her parents eating food made only for the spirit world. When they turned to pigs, she had to save them by becoming a temporary spirit working in the lavish spa.

In giving her a job, Sen then tries to make the best of it working with the other help and to make sure the guests are looked after and cared for.

Sen's duty ultimately leads her outwards to the spirit lands where she meets Yubaba's twin sister to return a seal which the dragon stole under the tutelage of Yubaba herself. All in all, this was a beautiful movie for scale, characters, the idea that being spoilt has its downfalls. And Sen really learn-ed the hard way.

""Spirited Away"" was more sparing in its employment of computer animation, entirely childlike in its wonder, and maintains the appearance and actuality of hand drawings and, moreover, the economical limited animation made its own style in anime. Both pictures feature amusement parks, the business for which the house of mouse conglomerate makes much of its money. For ""Shrek,"" this was a joke, but in ""Spirited Away,"" entry into an abandoned amusement park, which although it turns out to be primarily a bathhouse, is an adventure to the past, of a world of ghosts and transformations, of a hand-crafted and filmed animation. It's also compelling how the fairy-tale plot fits into this, with Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"" being the most apparent Western influence in this regard--particularly, after the rabbit-hole analogy, the chapter ""Pig and Pepper.""",

Spirited Away marks Miyazaki's first work as a semi-retired director, though the movie doesn't suffer from it in the least. Spirited Away is about a young girl gets lost in a world of ghosts and spirits and is forced to work at the bath house for specters.  Any fan of Miyazaki will instantly fall in love with this movie.  Don't be fooled by Disney's involvement or the fact that it's animated.  It's still very much anime, but not anime for anyone.  This is a good movie for young children and those who have a timeless love for movies.  If you're the kind of person who still loves Toy Story, for example, then this will become another one of your favorites.  People who are only into anime like Ninja Scroll and Cowboy Beebop, this may not be the movie for you.  This is a movie for those who love anime of all kinds, like myself.

(I really prefer not to elaborate because I don't want to push any buttons on this board.) But this movie was phenomenal, its very rare that I am impressed by modern cartoons now days but this film dazzled me so much that I had to rewind the film and watch it again the next day. There is so much neo-mythology and Post Alice Traumatic Stress Syndrome in this movie that I was tickled, honestly. There is a lot of imagination and colorful ideas and I wish that there can be many more animated pictures of this quality to come in the future - the movie resembled a lot of the wacky weirdness that were around in the old Betty Boop or Silly Symphonies cartoons, the animators really touched a chord in me and I thank them full heartedly.",

She starts off as initially sulky, but mainly because of a situation we can all relate to: she is moving with her parents to a new home, and thinks that her new life is ""gonna stink"". She becomes understandably panicked and suspicious when her parents decide to cross through a forbidden tunnel to a restaurant-filled village where they gobble up food that is sacred and cursed. Yes, CURSED -- her parents are transformed into pigs! To free her mother and father, Chihiro must find work at the town's central bathhouse (populated with all sorts of bizarre and unconventional spirits). The bathhouse's contemptuous owner, a greedy sorceress named Yubaba (who has, MY GOODNESS, THE HUGEST BABY I HAVE *EVER* SEEN!), grudgingly agrees, and in doing so renames her Sen. Although our ten-year old heroine is at first frowned upon by many of the bath house workers, Chihiro finds true friends in Kamaji, the six-legged(!) boiler man, Lin, the gruff but loyal bath house woman, and of course, Haku, a mysterious pale-faced boy whom Chihiro seems to have a deep connection with....",

This setting - unmistakably Japanese - provides endless amounts of nourishment as a massive showpiece of imagination, attention to detail, fancy, delight and cultural lore. There's more going on in the backdrops of Spirited Away's throwaway scenes than many of its contemporaries can manage to plaster up-front and center. It's a bit less focused than Princess Mononoke, which preceded it in the Miyazaki timeline, but that's because it's such a decidedly different, strange creature altogether. Here we're taking the time to embrace and celebrate the inherent weirdness of Studio Ghibli's world, where I could happily sniff daisies and people-watch for the rest of my days. The primary storyline is steadfastly unpredictable, twisting and writhing like a wild beast caught on a leash, but is able to, with time, pluck most every last plot thread and leave us all with a deep sense of satisfaction.

Said in a few words, it's a masterpiece of modern times, which spends most of his time in a parallel (and surreal) world of ancient Japan. Sen to Chihiro... has so many powerful stuff to stand out for. It has one of the strongest imagination I've seen in my entire life on animation, and also there's a lot of inventiveness, believable profiles on characters (and they're animated!), perfect on detail drawing (yes, hand made, traditional drawing), pulse accelerating action, humor, an outstanding and subtle soundtrack, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

181,14 October 2005,rggcandy,10, There is one word that could be used to sum up this film: nice.,"This film is just a pleasure on the eyes to watch. The number of amusing characters like the soots (those little friendly comical squeaking black balls of ash). The art style used was brilliant as well, including great backgrounds. The music it self was the part that makes the film, I say. The tune that plays when they are in the train is the best. But mainly the music is so calm and can make you feel very relaxed, it could even bring a tear to your eye if you're that sensitive. First time seeing it, it is quite scary especially at the beginning when the sun sets and after they are off the train. The story is great as well and not so weird as to confuse you. Although saying these things the film is fantasy and if you don't like fantasy, you won't like the film which is a shame as it is so very good. The main plot (family moving to new home father wants to take a look around is turned into a pig along with his wife, young daughter has to save the day) feels as though you've seen it being used somewhere before. But that doesn't matter as the rest of the film makes up for it. Children Will love it as well as adults. The amount of clever ideas used never seems to end as a world where anything can happen (not to sound cheesy or anything) and unlike films you get here, the fact that the weird things are left unexplained as to what they are or how they came to be get rid of boring scenes of characters trying to explain these things and taking up good film time.

There were scenes where I felt I was watching a Claude Monet painting. Stunning and very very creative. Even the characters developed beautifully. My biggest problem with the film was the randomness of the story. Granted I know nearly nothing about Japanese folk lore. The story was all over the place with random ""side missions"" that some how ended up helping the girl reach her goals. A lot of things that happened seemed to fall into place too perfectly. But we are talking about a film where a girl enters a magical spirit world so maybe it's not that hard to believe. Overall I think it deserves the recognition that it gets.

Despite quality (in some cases good; in others, bad) the sets, the characters, the animation and the colors always made us want to plunge inside the screen to follow the adventures in their quest; most noticebly, in my personal opinion, the Tv Series ""Evangelion"". When the trailor to the voyage of Chiriro hit the theatres, not a single skeptical and even so called hateful eye, could manage to blame any of its excentricities and its obvious scientific impossibilities. but has we have seen in many other movies before, either animated or not, many of them are not attempting at plausibility, they're rather a metaphor. What this movie r is all about is love, and how we can step out of our fearful world to try to catch our beliefs, save the ones we love. In that area, the movie plainly fulfills its mission: it has emotion everywhere, being that same emotion supported by a dazzling animation. Mutch to my desmay, I truly wanted to like Chihiro, but it became somewhat of a bore: like many other movies it could have been told in half the running time, some scenes were totally expendable, and somewhere around the middle of the movie, it becomes a total compliment to gore and dirtyness. Sincerelly, over two hours of dazzling animation aren't enough to make a movie all that great. In the bottom line, as for me, the movie only was average worthy in the instrumental main theme; Chiriro 'flying' from room to room towards Yobaba and Chihiro's fabulous view from her room. It's eye candy, in fact, but it doesn't make us plunge. That's its main and fatal sin.",

Her father takes a wrong turn and they end up at a tunnel of which leads them to a small rural town. Her parents sit down eat food Chihiro explores and finds a Bathhouse when she returns she finds out that her parents have been turned into pig and that she's actually in a world of spirits with the aid of a boy name Haku she gets a job working in the bathhouse under a witch named yubaba. Now going by the name of Sen she must now find a way just save her parents and find a way home. To say this is the studios crown and achievement is not an understatement. While the studios been popular in Japan with many films being financial hits, they were still more of obscure to Western audiences. This is the film that brought the studio to the main demographic of the west demographic and One of the first animated films ever to win an Academy award. This is a breathtaking piece of animation from it setting, its characters, story and it's music. Chihiro herself is one of the best written kids in animation she's pure and innocent,timid and scared but also determination shows in the evolution of her character. She's just a scared little girl at first, thinks moving to a new home is the worst of her problems. She's sad, she cries she's a kid that you want to see succeed and get home. She has to learn to adapt to this environment having to work in this bath house with all the spirits who outright have a bias towards her. Factor in the fact that knowing that if she screws up that she will end up joining her parents and will obviously be eaten. She grows tremendously. The film also has it supporting cast various spirits who are you to hear along the way Haku is Yubaba Slave who gets Chihiro the job in the bathhouse. You don't necessarily know why he wants to help though you can tell his tensions are pure,and that he wants to see her safe. Yubaba is a Perfect depiction of a witch she's old wrinkly and ugly with an over exaggerated nose and a huge boil in the middle of her forehead. She acts like a Cron to everybody else but she has a baby that she just pampers and spoils and it all motherly. Her design is so great it would be used in a similar way in howl's moving Castle. Kamaji& Rin also leave a lasting impact that you remember them. But the one other character everybody remembers most from this movie is no-face a greed spirit. He wears a strange mask with a fixed smile on it doesn't speak. You don't really know what to make of him at first but he has a reason for his actions. The animation is beautiful shots of the countryside are green running through the flower fields. The ocean is sparkling blue. The bathhouse one of the best interior architecture's from the studio. The interior to the exterior majority of the movie take place here you have long shots that show off the size and scope of it traditional eco period Architecture. All the detail put in to just one scene such as Yubaba is a commitment to craftsmanship. It feels immersive specially with all the various different design spirits littering The place. Joe Hisaishi delivers one of the most diverse soundtracks ever the music goes from fast pace to slow and somber bombastic emotionally do you put heartwarming pieces. Spirited away remains one of the greatest animated films of all time and a classic that is always with me.",

206,3 April 2020,anti_heroi,10, Chihiro is an ative agent in Spirited Away. It's transformate the way to express the childhood in animations,"Spirited Away is, of course, a big experience to evertyone who wants to know the process between chidhood and adulthood/amadureciment. The film express this theme thought Chihiro, the main agent of this process, who doesnt have the perspective of the adult age, like a psychology book about chilhood, but the movie shows the consequences of this transition thought the own children.
Chihiro is showed in the beginning like a spoiled girl that all time is complaining about everything and everybody. She complain about the fact her are going to other city and about the fact her flower are dying (this is her responsability). In this first half of movie, Chihiro is, basically, a girl who have fight with whole the world about little things. With the happening of the story, when this parents are transformate in pigs and the region of restaurants started to be invades by ghost and sobrenatural criatures, the world had the effort to challenge Chihiro to get out of this situation, and this is one of the mensages of the movie: The world is a place that is indiferent or againt you.
To survive, Chihiro need to work in this sobrenatural society, a society that have a big obssession for gold. In this little information, is possible to compare with the capitalist real world about work and greed, for example Yubaba, the society's leader who's appear in movie like a authoritarian person. Yubaba, who's represent the boss, the politic and all of people who's only see money, shows her insanity when she ""take"" Chihiro's name, removing some letters in kanji (japanese writing) e transforme it in ""Sen"". The name ""Chihiro"" is formated by ""thousand"" and ""search"" kanjis, representing the person who's is big, numerally, but ""Sen"", name imposted by Yubaba, is formated only by ""thousand"" kanji, transforming Chihiro in a number. However, the most interesting about Yubaba is, not necessary, she is retrated like a bad character even have some characteristics of ocidental animations villains, like Disney. In some moments, she helps the people in some hard works in the bathroom, like in the ""stink spirit""(Kawa no Kami)'s incident, when she motivate Chihiro/Sen to serve the customer. An antagonist building that isn't totally bad distance of cliches animation and transforme Yubaba in a more humanizate character.
When it's know all dificulties that fight in this journey, important to her ripening that isn't ""opost to chilhood"" in any moment, many elements appear in movie, main in the second half, represent the memorie and the nostalgia of chilhood not valorized by Chihiro in the benning. The hair tie gived by Zeniba (Yubaba's sister) and stitched by No-Face (Bandai-Gaeru) is one of this elements. This Tie, that according to Zeniba can protect Chihiro of all bad things, transforme the material object, liked to polit in the capitalist world, in a emotional object, when, in this topic, express the emotional value of the things and not only the finantial value is part of individual ripening.
Spirited Away is one of the best Hayao Miyazaki's movies. Chihiro is not a passive agent that only see the world happen in your life, that is the form to represent the childhood in many times, but a ative agent who can build new thing in the world and suffers the consequences of his actions because the child is part of the world too. Like say the song of the brazilin poet and composer Arnaldo Antunes: ""Everybody was child yet, Einstein, Freud and Plato too/Hitler, Bush and Saddam Hussei/Who have money and who doesn't have""",
207,5 December 2011,estreet-eva,8, Miyazaki's Classic,"We caught the next in the continuing series of Hayao Miyazaki?s animated children?s movies playing at our town theater this weekend. ?Spirited Away? is considered his masterwork and features his classic themes including environmentalism, a plucky young girl, witches and other magical creatures and the consequences of an older generation?s greed. Unlike other of his films there is no backdrop of war in a fanciful land but rather a move to the suburbs by an ordinary family. Chihiro, who is renamed Sen by the evil witch Yubaba, must face the mostly hideous other-worldly creatures of what appears to the outside world as an abandoned amusement park in her quest to return her parents to their original species. She is befriended by the Miyazaki?s compulsory flawed but brilliant wizard, in this case called Haku. Unlike his other films, there is a non-magical (muggle?) female lead called Lin who also aids Chihiro. As usual the animation is amazing and is made frightening by surrealistically outsized facial features on the evil Yubaba and her ridiculously sized baby. Conversely, the six-armed boiler-tender called Kamajii is disturbing because of a fluidity of his movements which give the impression that we might be OK to go ahead an evolve a few more limbs. Most impressive is a train which travels through the lonely, flooded plains which surround the bathhouse and the other station stops. The train is peopled by ghostly passengers rendered as dark silhouettes who slowly depart until only Chihiro and her small party of creatures remain. This sequence is the most truly dream-like I?m seen on film. Chihiro eventually rescues her parents and reclaims her name by rejecting conventional reactions to seemingly evil characters and understanding what is causing them to behave the way they do. In one sequence she removes a literal gigantic tangle of junk from a river spirit which all the rest of the cast avoids due to his smell. In another, she rejects the gold gobbled up by the rest of the cast when offered by a character called ?No-Face.? After No-Face goes berserk and his gold turns out to be an illusion she lures him out of the bathhouse because she understands that the greed of the staff is causing him to tear the place apart. Finally, when Haku returns dying and in dragon form from Yubaba?s twin sister, Chihiro pulls out of him the golden seal he stole which is killing him. ?Spirited Away? received a 94 on Metacritic putting it 11th all time. It was also, apparently, the biggest money making in Japanese film history. I?m not sure I would rank it quite that high but it does an amazing job of relating its story of environmentalism, pacifism, and understanding through pictures that transcend the language barrier.",

Once you get passed the sheer absurdness of the whole thing, the film is enjoyable and very funny, but that's about it, I wasn't left with any feeling of enlightenment, or that i'd just witnessed one of the greatest films ever made. It's a cute film but that's it really. I'd like to see it again, because I really do wonder whether I've missed something that all these reviewers seem to have seen, but I can't really recommend this film as one of the greatest I've ever seen, because it just isn't.

221,2 August 2003,bix171,10, Amazing,"Hayao Miyazaki's animated masterpiece is a very foreign film--and not simply because it comes from another country (Japan); there's an imagination at work that's so organic and remote that it seems to spring from an individual's subconscious and as such feels as if it has no immediate relation to a single culture. But it connects universally, speaking as it does in a language that suggests anything's possible and children of all cultures will respond to it instinctively. (And it will touch the inner child of adults.) There's a stunning clarity in Miyazaki's hand-drawn animation and it's clear that a painstaking effort is made to detail every frame. His use of color is striking and gratifying: rather than depend on the bright, flashy pastels that seem to be the choice of computer animators, he uses a rich but muted palate that emphasizes the dreamlike aspects of the story (a young girl must rescue her parents who have been turned into pigs by angry spirits and in turn discovers her capabilities for self-reliance; in this regard, it's not unlike most Disney films) and finds its pleasures in the darker aspects of the settings and the characters. The story takes its time to develop and though some may find it more arduous than entertaining (and, admittedly, its mildly humorous moments are few and far between), as it builds the rewards become more and more evident until, by its simply beautiful conclusion, it's overwhelmed you and left you dazed. Unique, infused with wisdom and love.",

Could be coincidence in there, but then you see that Chihiro must protect her identity and name before she forgets it. Exactly the same happened to Bastian. Haku can turn into a flying dragon (although his hair reminds me of Atreyu), Neverending story has Falcor the luck dragon. I read the book and watched the movies as a kid, I see a heavy influence here. Spirited away is a great film, I just didn't saw anything new. Not Ghiblis best.

That isn't the only great thing about it though. It has a very compelling story line, that goes up there with some other great films, that will forever hold a place in our hearts. Another dazzling feature in this movie, is the music. It perfectly mixes, classical, European music, and Japanese music, it its glory. I must say, that when i first saw this movie, i had no idea that it existed. That isn't in any way a problem though, considering that most originally Japanese movies aren't very well known in America. Overall, this movie is simply brilliant, and actually made me feel like a better person. It also includes many different, deep ideas, that actually caught my attention, and my heart strings, much more than anything that could come out of ""The Matrix"" or something.

236,13 April 2018,Bored_Dragon,8, Best Movie for Grownups Who Refuse to Grow Up,"Although I don't like the anime style of animation, it didn't bother me this time. The story, if it is literal, does not make much sense, the characterization is lousy, and the motivation of the characters' actions is completely unclear. If the story is symbolic, maybe I did not understand it. One of the reasons for this may be that there was no script for the film, but it was written along the way. There is also a cultural gap between the East and the West. The authors were aware of this, so English-language synchronization contains more text than the original Japanese version, in order to explain to the Western audience some of the things that the Japanese perceive. But I was watching the original Japanese version, so I was deprived of these explanations. Based on what I have written so far, it looks like I didn't like it, but it's not so. All objections are negligible before the unique beauty of this accomplishment. Rationally, I would impose an average grade of five, or perhaps six, but this film does not aim at reason, but wins at a much deeper level. That's why in 2003 it won the award that suits it the best - Best Movie for Grownups Who Refuse to Grow Up. In addition, it won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, as the first anime ever nominated in this category.

In this film it doesn't seem to have much of the nature mixed in with the plot, though when Chihiro meets the River Spirit he has tons of trash inside of his body, which is what Miyazaki saw in a river my his city while he was walking.

Lighting and color palette are broad and well-chosen. An immense amount of imagination and creativity went into this, and you can feel it from start to finish. We are presented with a fascinating, strange world, an our trip to and around it is engaging. With a running time of just over two hours, this is the longest of its kind. However, it has spot-on pacing, never boring or overstimulating the audience members to the point where you take a break from your viewing, in spite of the odd, and once or twice even disgusting, things that this shows us. It is also open to interpretation. And in spite of that, it also tells a story so that anyone, of any age, can follow it. Not everyone will understand everything that's going on, but we can all enjoy it. I can only comment on the original actors, as I did not choose a dubbed version; their work is marvelous, and that goes for every performance. The dialog is well-written. Apart from some potentially scary and/or disturbing content, there is nothing offensive in this. The DVD comes with 18 minutes(!) worth of trailers for it, and, on the second disc, the whole movie in storyboard form, with a commentary track, subtitled in English, a well-done, informative and entertaining 47 minute making-of featurette made up of behind the scenes footage, concept art, clips and narration(in Japanese, subtitled).

This causes them to turn into pigs and Chihiro runs away in fear, only to find herself in a strange new world full of gods and spirits all coming across the river to visit the luxurious bath house that Chihiro must find work in if she is to stay safe in the other world. In this strange fantasy land she meets gods of all shapes and sizes, evil witches, giant babies, and even dragons. It is an immaculate and beautiful film, but it is also an incredibly touching story that gleams with love and compassion. It's a true work of visual and emotional art.",
261,2 March 2009,Aaron1375,7," Strange, but fun trip through a spirit world bath house.","I saw the movie ""Re-Cycle"" not that long ago and people on boards for that film talked about two scenes that resembled each other so I wanted to see this one. I have seen another film made by this company ""Nausica"" and I could tell there were similarities in music and animation style. Well the bridge scene was a bit similar, but my girlfriend says there are a lot of tales in Asian culture of holding your breath so the spirits can not see you so it really was not to a like. Actually, I found this movie while a bit flawed here and there for my tastes more entertaining than that other film and much more whimsical. A girl and her parents are driving to their new home and get detoured along the way and end up at what appears to be the entrance to a long abandoned theme park. Well the daughter, named Chihiro has a bad feeling about this place, but her parents just have to explore. Suffice to say the daughter's bad premonition about this place turns out to be correct as the parents stumble upon a lot of food in one of the buildings in this place and proceed to eat the food like Goku eats in Dragonball Z. In the end the girl ends up trapped in what is the spirit world, and this theme park which is actually a bath house for the spirits. The girl ends up getting employed by the witch who runs the bath house and has her name basically stolen by her as she goes from Chihiro to Sen, a boy named Haku at times seems to want to help her and at others seems cold to her. Her parents are pigs, a strange creature seems to really like her and she gets to meet all sorts of interesting new chaps. The problems I found with the piece you ask? Well despite a rather lengthy runtime of 125 minutes it still feels like it needed more. Many interesting plot points wrapped up with not enough development, like No-Face. The twin sister's strange turnaround in they way she acted and treated the girl. The way she gets back seems a tad rushed too, however for the most part this movie was simply a delight.",

269,8 February 2021,judemcrobbie,3, Not my favourite,"Considering this is more than likely a movie targeted towards children, there is so much product placement.
I didn't enjoy this movie for a multitude of reasons:
Firstly I did not enjoy the animation. I understand this may be the style, but the moving objects and background environment just don't work together. The realism of the background is incredible but the car, or people just don't fit. Some people may enjoy this, but it just took me out of the film.
Another reason is the exaggerated nature of anime. I understand most films don't go for hyper-realism, but I just can't get sucked into a super exaggerated movie.
Also virtually nothing makes sense. I feel it might have been designed this way, but it comes across as lazy writing and as an almost insult to the audience. This is especially clear as there is key plot points aren't foreshadowed, and they make you question why that happened for example, someone (I'm really sorry but I can't remember her name) with no prior evidence nor chat about it gets superpowers just to further the plot.
Chichiro, without any reason knows things she shouldn't (without thinking). She somehow works out that her friend is a dragon with no prior evidence.
So my main issue with this is the lack of development.
I did enjoy a bit of this movie however:
The acting, especially considering its voice acting, in very good as they perfectly portray emotion throughout the movie.
The score is genuinely beautiful. Heartwarming and peaceful, it ties the animation and story in a beautiful harmonious nature.",

'Mononoke-hime' is absolutely one of the best all-around films I've ever seen. I did so want 'Spirited Away' to take me to that same place...and it almost did....almost. I watched the English translated version and occasionally got the distinct impression that what was being said and what was going on didn't quite jive. I don't believe in giving out 'spoilers' unless I am discussing directly with someone who doesn't care and I won't start here. All I will say is that I wasn't satisfied with the revelations/resolutions/explanations. Like most films of this genre it is allegory and metaphor. Usually I am able to bridge to a successful interpretation as I did in 'Mononoke...'. I viewed this twice to see if I was missing something. No. It is what it is. I was not compelled nor was I satisfied with the central characterizations. They didn't seem rooted. Maybe that was part of the problem here - that being reality merging into and becoming part of a so-called alternate reality. The reality wasn't established very well. No lessons were learned. Explanations for the metaphors kind of fell to the wayside. Then it ended. Groan. However, it is an entertaining film and I do recommend it! 'Mononoke..' is still my first love.",

272,24 April 2022,eightylicious,10, Spirited away - More than a children's cartoon,"Since the beginning of Western animation, few people have considered it more than ""children's material"", and thus paid little attention to the powerful messages entailed in such works. When Japanese animation, the so-called anime, came to the West, the same way of thinking was applied to them, something that often had disastrous consequences, with anime deemed too violent for children - which, they were, but not all animation is destined for the young ones - being censored, France especially having a history of edited Japanese animation programmes during the 80's. What ""Spirited away"" succeeded in doing was change the mindest of thousands regarding anime. That it won the Oscar of Best Animated Feature shows it all. Where does its charm lie? Why did it win such a prestigious award, coming from a country of which the animation tradition wasn't deemed but for children at the time? The answer is hidden in its special character, that makes it simply unforgettable.",

I searched out some of the negative comments out of curiosity to see what possibly could some people NOT like about this movie. Most reasons pointed to the lack of character development and the lack of a real story that made sense. In other words they expected something that fits perfectly together as often happens in all Disney movies. Not to say that Disney movies are bad, they're just different, they're very simplistic and offer nothing more than an hour's worth of entertainment. Spirited Away blew me away, all the motifs were portrayed so carefully and subtly and with such amazing animation visuals. It combined elements of many classical popular stories that I myself was familiar with and thus able to enjoy. It is probable that individuals exposed only to the Disney ""culture"" which comes very very close to no culture at all is negatively surprised by this movie. For everybody else who is familiar with coming of age stories, and other stories rich with fables and with lessons will see the lessons and motifs portrayed in Spirited Away and will not JUST look for a plot line and character development, but will see beyond that to discover that the plot was fantastic and there was also plenty of character development.

It portrays a very colorful cast with a simple plot line. It transports viewers to a dreamy land of super-natural, makes it a little frightening, yet because of the main character's innate innocence (she being a child), adult viewers are reminded how to be kids again...in another light. In the end, Miyazaki's constant message (it appears to be an ongoing call) prevails: protect our environment. :)Like all of Miyazaki's films, it is an expected hit, not only for its intricate plot line, but also for the name of the director himself. Attach Miyazaki's name, and Japan comes lining up. Too bad for America though, since they have yet to line up for a film that actually conveys a worthwhile message. Animations films in America are still equated for the kids' market, and it's a pity that it is still being marketed for them without considering animation as a distinct genre for all market groups.",

Like much Japanese artwork, a lot can be said with simple strokes of a brush.  Details here are applied to the areas they are required and not where they are unneeded.

I saw several strong reviews which seemed legitimate, and so I forwarded about 40 minutes toward the end to see if something cool happened in the last 20 minutes to justify the preceding two hours. (Sorry -- I would not normally review a movie I did not watch in toto, but I saw 75% of this and that was enough of a sample size...) Basically this was bad. The plot was bad, the lines were bad, the characters were weird. I understand that people see a lot of symbolism in this movie and that it speaks to deeper themes. But any message is so buried in this bizarre plot and these incomprehensible characters that it is lost through all the muck. I'm not quite sure why this fails where things like Alice in Wonderland or the Wizard of Oz work. Those movies (stories) arguably have bizarre plots, characters etc., but somehow those work and this does not. (Perhaps the animation is a part of it.) I was tempted to say that this is just a children's movie; but then I realized that I would not even put a child through this. Even if this entertained a child, I don't know that it would be good for their development to sit through this nonsense. They might as well watch four episodes of Scooby Doo; at least that has a plot and some semi-logical resolution. Part of this could be cultural too; perhaps this plot and symbolism work better in the Orient; not sure. But now I'm regretting that I did not stay with my gut feeling and dodge this one. I was inclined to give it a 1/10 just to counter-balance some of the high ratings here, but I don't want to go that far; 3/10 seems right. Maybe I'll try this again in 20 years and see if I perceive it differently; but for the next two decades this one is on the shelf...",

I know there is some symbolism behind the story and imagery, but the weirdly meandering plot distracts you from appreciating it.  I will also agree that it is very different from American animated fare.  That is a warning and not a compliment.

Wile watching the Japanese version I accidentally, and fortunately, found out that there are two different subtitles: one is what Disney has come up with, and the other is the original (Miyazaki's) screenplay.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that Disney has changed about %90 of the lines that Miyazaki had come up with for the characters.  It seems that it has become a trademark for Disney to add a certain level of stupidity to anything that that they are involved with, including master story teller and animator, Hayao Miyazaki's projects.  Give yourself a big favor and watch the Japanese version with English subtitles (make sure you choose the ORIGINAL translated subtitles.

Regardless of what you might compare it to, it's a tale of a young girl who is thrust into an alternate world full of strange, but interesting characters. If it has a flaw, I felt it ran a bit long at over 2 hours...though I admit I was a bit tired while watching it. It's quirky characters and stunning animation are pleasing to watch, but it didn't quite live up to the hype I had heard about the movie prior to watching it.

Indeed, this is where most of its time is spent; its overarching plot isn't as important as you might expect it to be.

Doesn't No-Face's monstrous devouring remind you of people, or events? The writhing of the dragon, the sludge of the polluted river spirit-- aren't these images you will come back to in real life? Miyazaki has gone beyond simply trying to tell a story. He understands the very medium of traditional animation and what it is best at doing, the things other media simply cannot pull off.

Japanese animation is currently the state of the art in this genre and is very popular worldwide. This type of animation does not pay as much attention to detail as older Disney animation did, but makes up for their lack of detail with more action-oriented storylines and sequences. Disney films used to be sensitive to the psyches of young children, and in some cases, even older children. Japanese anime does not concern itself with these problems; they just draw it up as they imagine it, and look for audience response from their efforts; negative or positive. This, in my opinion, is a rather reckless approach to animation, however, it is undoubtedly entertaining. So, parents, be aware your child will be at risk while viewing some of these Japanese cartoons, but will most likely still be entertained by them. This particular one, Spirited Away, is a bit more sensitive to younger viewers than most other Japanese anime; so you can take your kid to see this one.",

BUT the bad distribution and zero-promotion is a crime against movies.,"One of the things movies CAN do, and great movies ALWAYS do, is evoke: Dimensions, ways of being, feelings, thoughts, emotions, etc. Dimensions that are somehow ""above and beyond"" our normal, everyday lives. ""Spirited Away"" really does a great job of that. Any description I can imagine fails in capturing the essence of the movie. It is animated, but it is no cartoon. In fact, its essence, its life, its ""legs"" are so much richer and closer to a truth of some kind than many conventional movies shot on film stock with more or less human actors. For example, ""Spirited Away,"" in my opinion, is much more real and much more watchable than any Julia Roberts performance ever put on film. ""Spirited Away"" is, in fact, a breath of fresh, vibrant air. OH MY GOD--- I sound like a film school graduate--- but it's true nonetheless.",

It is, without a doubt, one of my top 10 all-time favorite 2D animated movies. This film fires on all cylinders, and then some! As I mentioned, it's like all children of the world made a drawing and then those drawings found a place in this movie. One neat thing to point out, is that this film is not based off a novel and it's not a reboot or a remake. No, this movie is completely unique and original! This is one of the most imaginative and creative movies in cinema. The story hooks you right at the very beginning and keeps you invested from beginning to end. All of the voice acting, in both the English and Japanese versions, are pitch-perfect. They really bring their respectable characters to life, and it's some of the best voice acting in any animated film. These characters are so relatable and likable to the point where you personally care about them, and want to do your part and help. That's the mark of fantastic characters and exceptional character development! The spirit world where the movie takes place absolutely engulfs you in it. When you look at it, you think: ""wow, wouldn't it be cool to check this place out?!"" However, at the same time, you'd think: ""you know, I don't think I'd want to stay here after all."" It's a world that's just as terrifying as it is beautiful. Therefore, it sets the tone for the film and story perfectly. This is one of those movies that would be impossible to do a live-action adaptation. It wouldn't have the same charm and feel of the 2D look and it wouldn't be nearly as strong. The 2D animation elevates the power of the film and it resonates with people that much better. Finally, the soundtrack is perfect and ties the film together. The film score really brings this movie to life! ""Spirited Away"" is definitely the best film made by Studio Ghibli. But, the real mastermind is writer and director Hayao Miyazaki. Props to you for creating one of the best 2D animated films of all-time! I can watch this movie over and over again and never be bored with it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Spirited Away"", go and watch it any way you can. You need this movie in your life. When I first saw it, I was blown away. Every time I watch it, I'm equally intrigued as I was when I first saw it. That's the makings of a phenomenal film, when it evolves as time goes by. Check out ""Spirited Away"", and prepare to have your spirits enter a whole new world of imagination!",

443,5 July 2007,stefanbe,10, Spirited Away is an amazing and impressive film that all families should certainly see as it stands as an absolutely brilliant work of art.,"Animated films are typically looked down upon as juvenile, especially those in which children play the protagonists. This is highly unfortunate, because that means that people with that frame of mind will miss the majestically beautiful Spirited Away. Hayao Miyasaki is an animation genius and Spirited Away stands as the masterpiece of the Japanese filmmaker. No animation director in the future will be able to match the carefulness and supervision with which Miyasaki makes his films. He is not only responsible for directing and writing a lot of his works, but also working on the animation. It's also wonderful to see a filmmaker who is not afraid to work with traditional cell animation, making Spirited Away is very refreshing to watch in this CGI-drenched world.",

445,10 February 2004,Da Cunha 11,9, Spirited away is certainly one of the most surreal and beautiful films I've seen,"Spirited Away - Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi - 2001 Every year there's a handful of films that manage to take flight and cross international boundaries with massive success and translate to a truly international audience. In 2003 Hayao Miyazaki's Animated Masterpiece, Spirited Away, washed up on British shores to an audience who took it in and loved it as the beautiful ghost world tale it was meant to be. This is an 'Alice in Wonderland' like tale, of a young girl who's parents are turned in to pigs while exploring and enjoying the cuisine of a seemingly abandoned theme park. Chihiro remains trapped in this theme park, that after darkness, becomes a surreal world belonging to a collection of ghost and beasts. Chihiro settles down as best she can in this parallel word, as she befriends many characters, and searches for her parents. While the story line may be a little disjointed, the visual imagery of this film makes up for any faults. From the eccentric and eclectic characters, to the serene and stunning landscapes through which Chihiro journeys. This is thanks mainly to the fact that Miyazaki has combined hand drawn and computerised animation, to good effect. It successfully presents a film in a medium usually reserved for kids, but makes it encapsulating for both adult and child alike. Spirited away is certainly one of the most surreal and beautiful films I've seen. 9/10",
446,8 October 2022,moviesknight,9, Wonderful. Brilliant. Worth the time,"Beautiful beautiful film. Every aspect hits. Comfort film. Calming visuals. Enticing story. Good animation. Story is just not focussed on one part but standing on a lot of things like love, kindness, evil, misery, capitalism. Strong metaphors. Letting go of things and never looking back. Fighting for the loved ones with overcoming every hurdle and setback. New things are always scarier but with loved ones on side they can be less scarier. We have to adjust to change. Unexpected friendships and kind people who make all the difference. Growing up is always something we want to but it asks for no hurry. Every experience matters, both good and bad, only if we learn from those. Would love to see it once again for the things I missed on first watch.",

I realized that I was SUPPOSED to feel really sorry for this little girl's plight and worried about her fate, but quite frankly, all her screeching and crying really got on my nerves to the point that I began to wish she really would be ""spirited away"" - off my screen!

450,9 May 2018,nightroses,7, When ghosts are funny,"This is made by Studio Ghibly and has a certain look about it. There's so much detail in places. It's colourful, rainbow gorgeous, bright, and pleasing for the eye, even if the story is quite hard. The main character is a girl who loses her parents in a strange place, and she feels lost and alone. A boy befriends her and protects her from the weird ghosts and spirits that haunt the place at night. By haunting, I mean ghosts treating the night as a carnival. I won't spoil the rest but it's basically nightmarish if you ignore the funny bits, like the amusing frog character, 8 legged engine man, and the cute spiders, or susuwatari, who carry coal and eat sweets.

We had to share our computer time and she forced me to sit there and watch this. I didn't like this film at all, and was constantly throwing a tantrum at every scene. First of all I had never liked anime, probably my sister had heard about this from school. And secondly I could have been playing browser games instead of watching this.

I haven't seen this masterpiece in anything but the dubbed English, even though many say it is incredible with subtitles or even just in Japenese. I can guarantee you that you will fall in love with this movie. Maybe not after the first time you see it, but maybe after the 2nd 3rd or 4th. Chihiro is a little girl who is moving. She is a drama queen in the car as her parents are driving her to her new home. Then her father gets lost and Chihiro and her parents wind up at a building in the woods.. they walk through the structure and enter a world of wonder with spirits and magical creatures. She overcomes many obstacles in this odd world and changes her attitude and perspective on things. I do have to admit that the first time I saw this movie, I had no idea what was going on. After a while I just stopped paying attention to the plot and just focused on the brilliant art of the movie. But after the second time watching it, I totally got the movie.

461,29 May 2007,bigmoecrusader,10, Chihiro's Sacrifice and Selflessness,"At first glance Spirited Away seems to be another knockoff kid's cartoon, but actually is an adult movie that shows the corrupt modern society and its weaknesses. Hayao Miyazaki directly related the story to the problems of modernity compared to a traditional sense. The main character Chihiro is depicted as a modern girl who throughout the story captures traditional aspects in her life. Through Chihiro, Miyazaki shows the audience how the younger generation can change from a corrupt way of life, but the older generation is incapable because of there greed.",
462,29 September 2021,emryse,10, A Magnum Opus,"Film is, when boiled down to it's simplest elements, a series of still images conveying a story, the first films were devoid of sound or colour and you were left to simply marvel at the image being presented to you. Spirited Away has sound, it has colour but in the end what makes this film so good is it's beauty, seeing the bath house for the first time, a dragon having his mouth pried and when the town becomes alive with spirits, you could take away the dialogue and the music and I think I would still love these scenes just as much as I do now. When making his films Hayao Miyazaki begins with the storyboards, the dialogue is one of the last elements added, his films are first and foremost eye-candy, helped by their sincere plots and sweeping scores but still always taking you back to those visuals. Hand drawn animation, in my eyes, will always be superior to CG and this film is a prime example of what can be done if you're determined enough and have a vision. I know I've been going on for a while now about the visuals but I promise you they really are that good, still I'll stop now and move onto something different, the music. Joe Hisaishi gives the audience one of cinemas best scores with this film, similar to his work on My Neighbour Totoro, another brilliant Studio Ghibli film, his music for this film conjures an instant feeling of nostalgia, I know absolutely nothing about music theory but I do know that he has gotten something right because this is the sort of score you can listen to without having ever watched the movie and still enjoy. The voice acting in the dubbed English Version is decent, I think both Chihiro and Yubaba are excellently voiced but the entire cast deliver memorable performances. All in all there is nothing for me to criticise.",

469,6 April 2006,remittanceman-1,10," Best film ever, bar none.","I don't know what to say about the grandeur of this masterpiece that hasn't already been said, except that you haven't truly lived until you've seen Spirited Away. Hayao Miyazaki is renowned as a filmmaker. He's never make a film that was anything short of fantastic...until this. This film is beyond fantastic. This film is quintessential. Okay, enough with the gushing. What's good about this movie? Let's see... The animation is the best I've ever seen, without exception. You all talk about the attention to detail that is paid by films such as Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Screw you. You can do anything with a computer with very little skill involved. It takes true passion and devotion to hand-draw something this good. Every scene, every camera shot has at least five things going on at any given time. That's a minimum. Even when they're just showing a place with no people in it. Take, for example, the shot of the food stand at the beginning of the film, just as Chihiro's mother and father are about to enter and gorge themselves. There is steam rising from the food and that steam distorts the imagery directly behind it. In the back of the stand, a fan can be seen turning clumsily. This is just one example of the phenomenal animation that is, as I said, the best I've ever seen. The story is genuinely unique. A young girl is moving to a new home with her mother and father. Due to a navigational error, they end up in what the father says is an abandoned theme park. The girl, Chihiro, realizes there's something wrong, but her parents don't pay attention. Soon, they have both undergone a mysterious enchantment, and Chihiro, trapped in a world of spirits, must call upon the inner strength she never knew she had. This is the story in a nutshell, but there's so much more than that. You can see Chihiro grow from a scared little girl into a confident young woman. You can see the love that Chihiro develops for this new place and its inhabitants, particularly an enigmatic boy called Haku. You can see her struggles, her pain, her joy. That brings me into the next category: voice acting. The voice acting is superb. Particularly notable are Daveigh Chase as Chihiro and Susan Egan as Rin, but everyone shines, right down to the bit parts. One of the most magical aspects of this film is the score, which can move me to tears if I'm in the right mood. Listen in particular to the score at the very beginning of the film, as Chihiro and her parents are driving, and DEFINITELY listen to the score as she, the baby mouse, the little bird, and No-Face are riding on the train. Not much happens in that scene, but it is, in my opinion, the most beautiful five minutes in the history of cinema. Finally, the score at the very, very end of the film is what makes me cry. I won't give away the ending, but the music accentuates the mood. It's strangely tragic, and one of only three films that has ever made me cry. The others, in case you're interested, were an obscure anime film called Battle Angel...and the other was Rent. In conclusion, I would recommend this film to anyone. Young, old, male, female, anime fan or not. You will like this film. I have yet to meet someone who doesn't.",

477,3 September 2016,PetarNeo,10, You will be Spirited Away,"Miyazaki has proved to be the best creator of as much as visually stunning, intelligent and powerful movies. After Chihiro and her family enter the magical world it gets really serious. Movie just gets interesting with every minute that passes and constant discoveries of new world keeps us speechless. While Chihiro is new to all she adapts very fast and tries to solve mysteries that are going on. She does everything to help her family and it's just nice to watch. Intelligent writing of Hayao and plot development is beyond a lot of movies created by powerful companies. As Chihiro is involved in everything and she goes around trying to figure out how to help her parents, save them and herself and leave that world at the same time she tries to help a Haku and other characters that are trapped in magical land. Finally at the end when Haku realized that his name is Kohaku river and as Set (Chihiros name in magical world) is brought to tell which of the pigs are her parents she does it correctly and sets her parents free. As she has brought to river and crosses, runs to her parents with joy and happiness. Their ignorance about everything shows us that Chihiro is strong character as she realizes that she saved them but they do not know that and anyway she is happy. Strong movie with a lot of twists and turnovers but beautifully shown world and everything inside. 4/4",

479,3 April 2020,krational66,8, Spirited Away,"Spirited Away- Always thought that this was the name of two people, and the result was one person, the former one was given the name, and the latter one was resourced. This story actually belongs to two names, Amber River and Chihiro. Miyazaki has the heaviest fantasy in the world, and he gives you better than you want. Well, with suffering, but not with falsehood. Okay, not brutal, not terrible, not built for destruction.
1. When xiaobai appeared, I completely fell in love with him and chihiro. When it was dark, someone took my hand and side, let's go, the lights of the city were left behind. Xiaobai ran out and said to chihrio, hurry up, hurry up. The. The lantern was lit. I didn't see his face clearly, xiaobai was very handsome
2. We are transparent until the body disappears. This time I changed to nothingness, this time I reached out my hand and couldn't touch it . Yes, I love TOUGH, I hope arms will drown me like the boundless sea
3. Chihiro burst into tears while eating rice balls, choked and couldn't swallow food. Xiaobai touched her hair, but Chihiro was really strong. Although girls can't help crying and crying so hard, they are really strong.
4. Sometimes I'm more like that injured dragon, struggling, angry, and biting everyone. There are no tears, only blood can flow. But I can become calm, as long as you hold me tightly.
5. I fell in love with a river, and he fell in love with me, and we met when my red shoes fell. Amber River, this is your name, Chihiro, this is my name. Don't forget the name, because forgetting the name will forget everything, forgetting what we once met, forgetting our love. I used to be in your arms.",
480,27 January 2007,general-melchett,10," Face facts, Japan is the home of animation.","We live in a world of animated movies. Most of them are rubbish, some are good - but none of them are entirely original. Each animated film probably uses the same idea that's been churned out about a thousand times before. Thank God for Spirited Away, then. Japan have always been good with animation - though Japanese animation frequently uses the comic-book style rather than big budget CGI effects, at least the Japanese can cook up some original, interesting plots with real culture and originality. Spirited Away is one of those films. It offers far more beauty and genuine though than bilge like Hoodwinked or the upcoming ""Simpsons Movie"" (which, I have a horrid suspicion, is going to be cr*p). It stays off the humour and cares more about adventure and magic. Personally, you can give me no humour and a great plot rather than loads of humour and a weak plot any day. We know from the start that Chihiro's going to have a lot of change in her life - having only just moved from her old school into a new, more obscure location. And from the moment we follow Chihiro's dad's car down that muddy road, we know that this film is going to be one very long adventure all the way. And it is. There's true magic to be found here - forget realism, fantasy is where great things lie. This is especially unique to Japanese culture and there is nothing in this film that has been churned out by anyone before. The wide array of interesting fantasy characters (No-Face is particularly noteworthy) and great colourful settings (the workhouse where Chihiro spends most of her adventure is a character all in itself) ensure that this is a film that will touch, amaze, take away the breath of, stun, interest and generally please anyone who sees it. Stop the flow of dirge and give us more animated films like this, Disney. 10/10",

Spirited Away goes beyond original with its characters and environment. It's a world you wanna live in but the same time kinda scared to. There's always something crazy coming around the corner with each scene and you can't help but be drawn in awaiting the next madness. Sometimes there's insane fast pace moments but it also never forgets to have down time and to take in the surroundings. There's nothing that can compare to this masterpiece. If you haven't seen it then why are you reading this review? Go watch it right now!!!!!,

Also I think the voice work for both the subed and dubed are both really well done. I also liked the way magic is used during the story, it's more fable like than Harry Potter like.

502,5 May 2019,iguth,8, Classic,"Spirited Away is an adventure. As Miyazaki's possibly most well known film, it serves as a jumping off point for most fans and does so in the most exciting way. The whole movie has a very colorful art style which perfectly mimics all of the colorful characters that our protagonist interacts with. She is able to build meaningful relationships with people that just want to help her or don't even talk. There are many smaller plots scattered throughout to show our leading lady's struggle and since each of these subplots have their own ups and downs you stay engaged at all times. Overall Spirited Away does what most Miyazaki films do which is transport the audience into a world that seems incredibly fantastic in comparison to our own. You feel real emotion and a lot of the plot holds a deeper meaning (so much so that I don't understand most).",

The characters are beyond hard to figure out and the storyline goes everywhere. You never know what's going to happen. Whenever I watch this, afterward, the movie sticks with me, and I think about it for a while, trying to establish a certain connection. But the connection was always there, its just putting it together. All the characters are very diverse and interesting. Spirited Away is a very good movie with an extreme amount of growth with all the characters, and maybe even the viewer themselves. Not my favorite movie of all time, but it deserves a standing ovation, and even more. 10/10",

512,7 October 2002,fiddleswim,10, Pure spirit.,"To me, ""Spirited Away"" is about the ability of children to see the truth because their vision is not clouded by greed and prejudice and how adults ignore the observations of children at their peril. It is also about the redemptive power of hard work and how true satisfaction and happiness come from striving to do our best in difficult circumstances rather than from being fed and entertained.

I was impressed with not only the creativity it must have taken to make this film, but also the strength of the female protagonist. The little girl Chihiro is the hero of the story (a modern fairy tale), and she must rescue her parents, who have been magically transformed into pigs due to their gluttony. Interestingly, and in contrast to many traditional fairy tales, none of the ""evil"" characters is completely evil - each character has at least one redeemable quality (even Yubaba, the ""evil"" sorceress, is nurturing toward her baby), making the film seem more believable and natural. The overall themes of the movie appear to be ecological awareness, identity (remaining true to oneself), kindness, moderation (avoidance of excess consumption), nourishing one's spirit, and resilience (persistence in the face of adversity). I came away from this film feeling inspired and refreshed.",
515,6 July 2004,scobbah,9, One of the best animes ever,"We went to the video rent and hooked up with ""Spirited Away"", a film that both my friend and I have heard lots of good rumors about, that it's supposed to be one of the greatest animes ever - and who could've disagreed when there's Studio Ghibli who's in the work of the production. This piece starts out rather smooth and takes a quick roll into the story - and we're about to follow a little 10 year old girl who's entering a new realm, a new dimension of magic. I just love the vibe this piece brings, and it's really a Ghibli production! Well worth the good voting points at IMDb, and I suppose this really is one of the best animes ever, I can asure you it is in the top 5.

Sure, Nausicaa may be his masterpiece, but Spirited Away is much better. For starters, we have your spooled 10 year old girl moving to a new town and after her parents turn into pigs, she has to rescue them. Yeah sounds like a contrived plot, but its the way she goes about doing things, as well as splendid animation and music that make this worthwhile. She has to work for a living, and no kid will do that willingly, but she manages and makes friends who help her out along the way. The dub work by Pixar is excellent, it makes sense in Japanese or in English. There are no slow points: quiet scenes yes but nothing is boring, the screen demands your attrition with all the detail, hand drawn to boot.

534,28 May 2016,datautisticgamer-74853,9," Miyazaki, how we admire thee","Spirited Away is most certainly on the surface a fascinating movie, but inside it baffles those who think that only American animation is good (but to be fair, other films like April and The Extraordinary World and The Little Fox can do that too). The animation works excellently with the character designs and surreal tone of the setting. The characters are mysterious and can engage the audience constantly, if they don't execute it in the style you'd expect. The story seems so familiar yet features so many twists that it simultaneously feels inventive. Despite some dull moments (which weren't helped by the fact that I watched it on a particularly cruddy day), Studio Ghibli is, thankfully, in the vein of DreamWorks and Disney in that they recognize that animation should appeal to all, not only to children, and with all the imagination put into making this, it very clearly shows. This is a film that, no matter how hard the people at Studio Ghibli worked to make it, I imagine they had so much fun doing so. While not my personal favorite Miyazaki movie, this is still one of those animated movies that you should see before you die.",

I really think the rating formula is flawed if this movie beat out Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan and Forrest Gump. How did that happen? Flawed rating system maybe? The only thing remotely good about this ""movie"" was that the animation was good, but if I wanted just the art and no good story or plot, then I'd just go to an art gallery instead. I cant stand it when in ALL Japanimation films, the camera angle will just focus on an inanimate object for like TEN SECONDS! There is a part in this movie were the girl says goodbye to the ""River Spirit Boy"" and their hands pull away from each other as they part.

The storyline feels as though it is a tale of growing up, facing your fears and learning how to take care of yourself. We start out with a girl sheltered by her parents slightly who doesn't want to move. She's grumpy, thinking that no one cares about her own feelings about the move and has some fears about going to a new place. Because of her father's stupidity (in a sense), they end up at an old abandoned gate in the middle of nowhere and go on in. Turns out this place is a gateway to the spiritual world and the family is swept away into a rather enchanting world where only Chihiro will remember. She is separated from her parents, forced to work in a bathhouse and learn what her own strength is. ",

The story itself is a bit confusing in that some of the events don't make sense, for me it fundamentally boils down to a story about how people treat each other in an interpersonal sense but also how they treat things belonging to other people. The spirits are all inspired by shinto, so they might be a little bit strange or confusing but watching it with my kids they were delighted with the cuteness of some of the characters - or the horror of the others.

555,23 January 2003,elf67,10, Different and brilliant,"This is truly one of the great animated films of our time, right up there with ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Toy Story,"" although very different from both of those films. Like the director's earlier film, ""Princess Mononoke,"" this mixes Japanese myth with other influences and the filmmaker's own imagination (which includes some really creepy touches) -- but this film is tighter and more focused (and therefore better) than ""Princess Mononoke"" was. The plot summary doesn't do it justice: A girl and her parents wander into the spirit world, her folks get turned into hogs, and she has to figure out how to rescue them. But this is really a beautiful coming of age story about trust, seeing the good in people, being kind when it isn't expected, and, of course, facing new challenges. A terrific movie that's suitable for anyone age 8 and up.",

At first it doesn't seem so attractive, but the more you follow this narrative, the more interested you are in knowing how things work in that place. All this very well developed thanks to director and screenwriter Hayao Miyazaki who managed to do an incredible job.

Words such as ""masterpiece"" or ""classic"" somehow just don't seem adequate to describe this film.  There has perhaps not been such an important event in the history of film since the invention of the medium itself.  There are really only two groups of people that I would recommend this movie to: ANYONE and EVERYONE.  If you are in possession of both an auditory and a visual system, then SEE THIS MOVIE!

When No Face starts going crazy I was on the edge of my seat hoping he wouldn't get Chihiro. The ending was absolutely perfect with Chihiro finding out who Haku really was. It was also quite comical when Yubaba couldn't recognize her own son. This movie is a perfect film throughout and has no flaws. When Chihiro found Zeniba's house I found that part of the movie quite touching and loving. Zeniba the complete opposite of her sister provided Chihiro with the love and affection she was missing.

The animation is wonderful, the music is brilliant, but it is far more than just a children's film. It has enough symbolism and deeper meaning to appeal to an older audience too. One thing that did surprise me was how scary the film is. Watching the film now was terrifying compared to when I watched it as a child. Maybe you could argue that the main character Chihiro is quite annoying at first, but I think this is imperative to her character-arc. She transforms from an irritant to a self-assured, confident young woman.",
578,31 October 2002,FlickNomad,10, Spirited in So Many Ways...,"Hayao Miyazaki does it again, but much better then his previous Princess Mononoke. Spirited Away is a highly imaginative movie that does things that you can only find in the best children's fantasy books, but don't let that stop you if your an adult. At over 2 hours, it's epic-like, and requires a bit of attention.(And besides, there's a chunk or two of some scary parts that would give a 7 year old nightmares)",

You are immediately 'drawn' into the story and remain there until the credits. The story, the voice acting, the animation, are all the best examples I have seen in animation. Anyone familiar with Hayao Miyazaki's work knows he is a genius story teller and I feel Spirited Away is his best to date. This show is extremely entertaining for folks of all ages. If you are new to Anime this is definitely a great introduction to Asian quality and style animation. This show is perfect on all levels, I could not recommend it more.",
583,29 December 2016,noraauditore,10, One of the greatest,"This masterpiece of Hayao Miyazaki can be interpreted from so many aspects like sociology and psychoanalysis. I read many articles about the psychoanalytic interpretation of Spirited Away which basically tells that the bath house is actually a brothel and it symbolizes sex industry. Still, I prefer to focus another interpretation of this movie. There are very clear references to the pollution of nature in Japan and Hayao himself is being known as very sensitive for these kind of issues. He is very critical of his society and by Faceless, he tries to show this greed of capitalist societies, in my opinion. Also, Hayao loves to use child characters as protagonists (as we can see from Howl's moving castle, princess Mononoke, Kiki's delivery service and etc...) especially we can say it for girl characters. He used a random 10-years-old girl for this movie as protagonist and showed her development mentally.",
584,11 May 2020,Tanbalarai,10, Why an oil shop rather than a bathhouse?,"First of all, why do Miyazaki use the word of oil instead of hot water? Both are read as Yu injapanese.
I thought this was a hint that the substance and appearance were different.
What is Kaonashi(No face)?
I thought this was blank that is born, and that the contents could create it by what was taken in. Chihiro was nicknamed Hiro and became the number 1,000, but the essence is still Chihiro. Haku was originally a river, but now it is covered with a lid and becomes a culvert, but the essence is a river.
I thought that this story is to say that the appearance is different from the contents, and the appearance changes depending on the contents. No, it looks different even if the appearance does not change! ... The protagonist is rotten at first and looks ugly. However, when the story ends, this protagonist is truly charming and shining. It became the most attractive character in Hayao Miyazaki's animation. The contents of her which she take make the difference of the appearance. And inside of every human beings, there is an unknown power unknown to even thirself.
At first, the story composition follows the heroin's feelings and given tasks, and then expands to the story of the supporting character Haku from the middle. A wonderful completed work like a sample of a hero switching type script. It's made by a lot of money and it's one of Hayao Miyazaki's films that the camera moves really at his will. Objectively speaking, this is Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece! !!",

My favourite has always been COWBOY BEBOP, but even then I haven't followed the entire series. Additionally, I am NOT a big fan of animated movies. They always seem a bit too predictable, as if they cater specifically to certain viewers.

588,14 July 2004,Alcyryal,10, Stunning (Minor spoilers),"""Spirited Away"" is the story on a young girl, her parents, and their magical journey into a world inhabited by spirits from the living world. The parents, who have ignorantly taken food from the spirits, have been warped into pigs as punishment. Chihiro is left alone in a world that is foreign to her. Help arrives from Haku, who helps Chihiro find a safe place in the spirit world. Together, they try and find a way home for Chihiro and her parents. I had high expectations for this movie, seeing it in the top 50 of the Top 250 list on this site. But I had no idea that this movie would blow me away like it did. I hear some people complaining that this is a nightmarish movie that doesn't present a compelling story and is too scary for children. I think that they just need to open up to this movie and realize that this is competely different that what America is used to. The Japanese (even with such abominations as Pokemon, Power Rangers, Digimon, etc.) have such a broad imagination and such a unique way of story telling, something that is not often seen here in the U.S. In order to enjoy this movie, the viewer must open their mind and accept the world in which Chihiro travels to. The animation is nothing short of perfection. And the story is one of the best not only in the world of animation, but all of cinema. Chihiro begins as a sort of whiny little girl who complains about the major changes she is going through (She is moving to a new city). But the adventures she must endure in the spirit world change her. She begins to grow up and mature, while coming to understand the importance of selflessness. When Haku is attacked near the end of the film, she decides to put off everything else, even her parents, to try to save him.    This is a must for any movie collection. The Japanese have given us very good things and very bad things. This, however, is truly their gem.",

Every frame of this movie is filled with joy, excitement and creativity. Miyazaki's genius shines brighter in this movie than ever before. The plot is simple yet interesting, and it is paced in a way tnat never feels either rushed or too slow. The setting is super captivating, and the beautiful soft worldbuilding is constantly stealing your attention, in a good way. Chihiro is a very well written protagonist, and she goes through a very nice progression from a scared little girl to a confident young woman. This is of course partly thanks to the side characters. There's no villain in this movie, just real people and creatures with easily understandable emotions and motivations. Ultimately, what makes ths movie so good is the way it enchants. There has never been, and probably never will be, a movie that combines so many good elements and makes it work so well, a movie that sucks you in the way this one does.

The biggest difference between adults and children is not the soundness of the mind and the clarity of the mind, but the growing loss of possession and happiness. Because there is too much temptation in the adult world, adults often judge themselves based on what they see in others' eyes, whether they should be successful and feel happy. In the child's innocent heart, the entire world is rewarding itself, laugh when you are happy, and cry when you are sad. Live simple, so happy. Chihiro's salvation and salvation all come from her innocence. Even if she is in desire, a childlike heart can always lead her out of her confusion. So this return to the self is not only because of the courage of Chihiro, but also because of her innocence from the heart.",

This film has so many brilliant aspects put together to create a piece of cinematic theatre that really does top the bill!

Greed possesses both mom and dad and they start to eat from the tables. Sadly, it turns out that the amusement park is actually a gateway to another dimension, and the food was meant for many Gods and spirits who dwell there. A powerful witch Yubaba transforms Chihiro's parents to pigs. To save herself and her parents, Chihiro starts to work in Yubaba's bathhouse. There she meets a young dragon-boy Haku, a big sister like Lin and a strange spirit called No-Face who starts to stalk Chihiro.",
619,1 January 2004,Peter_Gunz,6," Visually stunning. Plot... lacking, to say the least","(Contains spoilers ahead) No one can throw down shots about this movie as far as animation style and artistic vision.  The color and fluidity of the scenes are amazing, I'm sure providing a source of inspiration for many young animators and animation directors.  But all throughout the film, I could not help but think ""for the love of God, pick up the pace"".  Now, I'm a big fan of the anime style, and I can certainly appreciate good craftsmanship (as is demonstrated in this movie), but the storyline was terrible.  I could hardly choke down the hacked up and ripped off Alice in Wonderland plot.  Throw in a cheshire cat and some more metaphors of narcotic consumption and you're right back at the old Disney classic.  The pace of the movie crawled.  Simply crawled.  Even during what were supposed to be the most dramatic sequences, I found myself grasping at straws in the consciousness department.  The character development was terrible outside of Sen (or Chihiro, whichever you prefer).  Her development from a whiny clumsy oaf to a confident clumsy oaf was at least half-way decent.  She was the only semi-rounded character in a world of static one dimensional characters. The only character that I found moderately interesting was the Boiler Room Man, Kamaji.  His sudden shift from being a surly old (6-armed) man to a caring sort of uncle figure to Sen was a little bit inexplicable, but forgivable.  The most ridiculous transition in this film was when No-Face chases Sen through the bathhouse in a seemingly murderous rampage, and then Sen forgets about that within about 90 seconds and invites him onto a train with her!  This goes unexplained, and the character of No-Face just suddenly becomes friendly and everyone seems to forget that he ate 3 people, and destroyed large areas of the bathhouse, but who needs a storyline when you can just cover it with pretty colors and nice backgrounds.",

625,8 July 2020,monsterhunt-94296,8, Reminded me why I watch movies,"Recently I watched Spirited Away, my first film from the acclaimed Studio Ghibli. I have to say, this movie reminded me why I watch movies. The sheer senses of wonder and awe radiate from this film. It is bursting with pure creativity. Our protagonist, introduced with the name Chihrio, is very likeable. Despite the fact she is a young child, she isn't 100% brainless as a lot of child characters are, the plot can naturally move forward without her making every possible mistake and error. That's not to say she isn't clumsy, because she certainly has her not-so-bright moments. Now, I watched the movie subbed instead of dubbed (asianpenguin's advice) so I can't say much about the dubbed version, but the voice acting was great. All the voices fit the characters and the world perfectly, and there wasn't an over-abundance of screaming/crying or anything like that. All the characters have personality, and these odd creatures never seem out of place. The animation here is simply beautiful. There are some shots in here that were perfect, and overall the movement is pretty fluid in most places. The story flows very nicely and I wasn't bored for once second when watching this movie. The amount of characters and world building done in only a two hour run time is a feat in and of itself, not even mentioning the fact of how wonderfully it was done. The only flaw that I really had with this film is the score, which was kind of inconsistent, let me explain. There were a lot of moments where the music enhanced the story and sounded fantastic, immersing me even more. But there were a couple odd moments where the music just.. didn't fit the scene. I don't know if this is the fault of the composer or the audio editors, but the moments were few and the highs were higher than the lows were low (if you know what I mean). There is so much more I could go on about, but I don't want to spoil anything. I think Spirited Away is a masterpiece, and gets an 8.5/10.",

However, the story is difficult to fallow, goes off on uncalled for directions and such. But the thing I was the least impressed, with was the character animation. For a movie that is rated the #2 greatest animated movie I expected it to have lush and fluid animation, sure some of the creatures and liquid elements were well animated, but the characters ended up looking flat and choppy moments. When it boils down to it, it was just another anime film. Nothing new really. The day I see anime animation with smooth shading as a posed to that awful over-used sharp shading, is the day they gain my respect. Until that time, I will look to American and others for the great animation in an animated movie.",

The animation technique is technically well executed, but the plot got spirited away in the process. At every instant new, completely unmotivated themes come up -- certainly ""imaginative"", but not ""creative"", as another friend put it very succinctly. The beginning is intriguing and raises high expectations, but I cannot help but think that the writer and director increasingly lost any sense of what the film should be about. Throughout most the second half, so-called evil 'stink spirits' run around vomiting non-stop (mildly amusing to watch), and towards the very end the film deteriorates into a sentimental, unoriginal story of true love and a misunderstood, wrongly resented witch.

631,23 August 2020,upayansinha,10, Beautyful masterpiece,"My first foray into the world of Studio Ghibli and the works of Animation Master Miyazaki San. This film sweeps you up with its use of cinematic language to transport you into a dreamlike world with a strong heroine and the amazing Characters she meets along the way.
A brilliant story with a nostalgic and heart-warming feeling, Spirited Away is a trip to a whole bunch of emotions with the help of Hayao Miyazaki. The story follows Chihiro who moves in a new place and ends up in a mysterious magical world. The story reminds of one of my favorite childhood movies, Alice in Wonderland, the whole concept of a little girl lost in an imaginary world and this movie was even better. Miyazaki made this story a magical trip through hardships and personal growth for the young protagonist to make us feel something never experienced before, hitting our souls with pure childhood feelings and despite being suitable for kids, I think grown-ups will enjoy even more this pretty fairy tale. I can't say I have any particular problem with the movie, it might get kinda confusing at times but it doesn't push you away from the emotional core so I can really stay entertained.

I have never before seen a movie compile so many different genera's and blend them so perfectly. I especially loved the bath house scenes because they have such a magical and festive feel. Out of all of them, my favorite scene is the one in which Sen cleans the muddy spirit because this is where she really starts to take a hold of the situation and begin to rely on herself. I loved to see how innocent Sen was in the beginning and then watching her mature and gain courage throughout the rest of the movie.

It is a film which is immensely entertaining and full of scenes which are just playing fun to watch. However, you must be warned. In between the incredibly detailed animations, there is an almost never ending mythological plot (this lack of realism irked some of my friends). There are creatures and monsters, heroes and villains, none of which are as they first appear. It has everything a movie should have however there is no guarantee you will like it. If Spirited away has one fault it is its length. At 2 hours it is a killer for those with short attention spans (I did however make it through and in the end was glad I did). When going into the movie if you can go in with an open mind purely with the desire to be entertained then spirited away is a movie well worth seeing; however, if you are one to find fantasy and cartoons dull and nonsensical then find another movie.",

The animation here is just superbly drawn and animated, and Miyazaki's eye for directing is as sharp as ever.   The script was light, as it should be, and like all children's films it tries to instill some moral lessons in its viewers.  These lessons are aimed at children, but are good for anyone to realize.  Some of the dialogue was a bit too kiddie, but it's not noticable or really a bad thing depending on preference.  The movie had a few scenes that are superfluous and stretch the movie thin.  That was really my only major complaint with the film.  Mononoke Hime is 20 minutes longer, but it never carries its weight as this film does.   And as I addressed in my title, I simply didn't feel the magic as much as others.  It's easy to be inspired by Mayazaki, and Princess Mononoke was a very magical film for me, but I just didn't connect with this movie the way most others did.

Its to crazy and makes me wanna shoot babies. I can't even name everything, god the Noface character killed me. The town and everything that went on in it was way to much I'm sorry. Just didn't make sense whatso ever. People think its good because they feel there has to be some sort of reason behind a speed trip this crazy. They feel that it has an intelligent aspect because they feel everything represents something or depicts something. It doesn't, I'm gonna tell you that right now, nothing in this movie makes sense, the title, the characters, the plot, the settings, nothing. If I filled a tub with acid and cut my self in several places the things i would see would very closely resemble this movie. Jimi Hendrix could've written this movie and it wouldve been better just cause the music would rock. People that are uninformed feel that authors and directors make everything represent something, everything. This is not the case, now I'm not trying to offend the director but I'm sure he just wanted to make a movie that seemed like a spectacular dream that the viewer was having. And he did a good job, but i bet if i went and asked him what things represent he'd be like ""well you see the noface character represented a creature that eats everything"". Thats exactly what it is, nothing more or less.

658,27 April 2020,Pierre-Andre-17,10, Don't forget what you strive for originally...-What I have learned through this profound animated movie.,"Every time I watch this movie, it reminds me of a story, a story that someone loses him or herself because of greediness:
Ogino' parents become hogs because they can't leave the so-called feast;
Boh is attracted by food and sensory feast in the bathhouse and finally becomes a monster after wasting excessively;
Haku enters the bathhouse to learn magic while becomes a thief controlled by Yubaba;
Almost everyone in the bathhouse works hard to get the gold, even if they know they will be swallowed....
What does the bathhouse mean there?
There exist a variety of food, sensory feast, which attracts people to come eagerly while leave satisfactorily. -This is more like a microcosm of our world, which is filled with and blotted by materialism.
But what happen after Ogino' s come?
01
Lost
When Ogino comes to this world, it feels like an innocent kid entering a la La Land. She witnesses her parents becoming hogs which represent the greedy men who only care how to cater for their appetite and never be satisfied.
She is pretty scared and doesn't want to eat any food in this world to cut her own appetite. However, without food people will disappear. So Haku brings food for her and tells her to work-only in this way she can survive, which means no pain no gain.
To avoid becoming a hog, the neophyte asks Yubaba for a job. Admitted Yubaba gives her a job, but she also stripes of her original name-Chihiro Ogino.
Ogino is her original name, original appearance and original identity.
While ''Sen'' is what Yubaba call her-this is a new identity meaning that she is working here.
If a man forgot his or her original name or appearance, he or she can't go back to the original world. Thanks to Haku giving Ogino her clothes to remind her her original name.
Sometimes people lost themselves in this way. In seeing the workers in the bathhouse, we should know that they are epitome of us, who want to make more money while don't want to do more work or just want to designate the others and bully the poor ones. In this way, we adapt to this world to greater extents;we chase power,success,higher ranks and more captured equipments....
So that's why kind Haku becomes a lackey of Yubaba;that's why frogs are willing to exchange their lives for money....
At this point, I want to ask how many people can still remember their original ideal and what we want to do at first?
Or we just be busy with something mundane and gone with the wind. Love someone;merry someone;have babies;become bosses and become rich.... Admitted, we might achieve something, but we also lose the basic ability to remember our name....
If we really change the world hard or if we are changed by the world hard?
While Ogino is still innocent:she only works and doesn't care about money. Everything she does is derived from her heart:bathing ''Stink Spirit,''helping No Face, and saving Haku.
Probably we might introspect ourselves:what we have swallowed in this world? Only vomiting the things like what No Face has done, we would be as clean as a mirror....",

From that on, you can't stop watching. You can't help but feel amazed at the characters' look, the witch with the gigantic head and even bigger nose, the creepy No-Face that can only moan and IS ALWAYS SO DISTURBING, the disgusting river spirit that is so well portrayed as if it smelled really bad that it is almost as if you could actually smell it.",

It's been re-baptised 'Le voyage de Chihiro' for it's French release and it's being shown in French theaters both in a subtitled and a dubbed version as I write this. I strongly encourage any Francophone to jump at this opportunity and see the film subtitled. But I imagine not even a dub, or even meddling from the editing-happy Yanks could really ruin a film as beautiful and enthralling as this.",

If you like anime Spirited Away is no. 1. on your list. Music by Joe Hisaishi is wonderful.

There were moments when its strangeness veered into excessive territory, hindering my full immersion in the storyline. However, over time, I gradually acclimated myself to its allure and became captivated by the movie's captivating beauty and enigmatic nature. While I don't foresee myself revisiting this film, I wholeheartedly recommend it to those yet to behold its wonders. It's highly unlikely that they'll encounter another movie quite like it.

The first one I saw was Princess Mononoke, so it was just natural for me to watch this one next, since it is from Miyazaki. I must say, this film really touched my heart. I haven't been captivated this way by a movie since I saw King Kong two years ago. Any way, I'll get to my points. The idea was actually very original, the main character was a typical cute and quirky little girl, and the film just blew me out of the water. First of all, Miyazaki's art style is really something to look at: he makes the bathhouse really believable, along with all its inhabitants. The struggle of a ten-year old girl to set things straight is something we can all relate to. The music was top-notch, bringing back memories (to me) of home, which would be Asia. Finally, Spirited Away shows, for people like me, that you don't always have to watch action movies with tons of violence. This movie had almost no violence, yet it was better than a lot of action-war movies I watch.",

Chihiro is the main character who has to work in the bathhouse to save her life, and her parents. She is portrayed in a good way, although her voice can be a little annoying, but this could be the product of bad translation. She is later given the Shinto name Sen, which means 1000.

Not knowing what to expect, my only assumption was that this looked like it could be a good movie, since I was getting a bit into anime/manga and anything that was a cartoon appealed to me more at the time, but what I got was something more.

Chihiro is my favourite character in the film, her attitude that progresses over the course of the film is great, from being scared & worried to a courageous & brave girl. The creatures freaked me out a little bit, but that's what you'd expect in a Miyazaki film. It's the best animated film ever made in the history of modern cinema, no animated film will beat it, if one ever does it will probably be made by Miyazaki himself. If you think this film is good, I advise watching Miyazaki's other work, his films combines fantasy with feelings, & easily sweeps Disney under the rug.

Not knowingly seen or heard of Miyazaki's work before ( although it takes a few times for a name to penetrate my consciousness), I was without preconceptions about the film apart from my friend's ""It's really good!"" as she handed the DVD to me as a birthday present. I have to agree with her. This film rocked. Appealing, I should say to many age groups, (I saw it with my mum and some 30 something year old friends), it in turn scared, startled, moved me, made me smile and laugh and warmed the deepest cockless of my heart. This has everything from adventure and mythology(Japanese of course) to friendship and love. I was with the little girl and her friends every step of the way. It is a bizzare film but very watchable and completely enchanting. The animation is much softer than the usual Japanese Manga style of cartoon, and the tale certainly not as bloody. (Barely bloody at all) I saw the American dubbed version and the Japanese, subtitled version one after the other, and I prefered the latter. A good film, when well subtitled, leaves you with the feeling of actually having heard the characters say the words in English, and this was the case with this film. The translation in the 2 versions were not the same and to me some of the subtleties in the Japanese version were lost in the American version were there was the added pressure of having to syncronise the words to(cartoon)lip movement. There were also some cultural adaptions from the Japanese version to better suit an American audience, which I prefered without.  Having said that, the American(English) version stands successfully in it's own right. My friends(& mum)who only watched the American version thoroughly enjoyed it. The DVD extras such as interviews with Miyazaki and the American director/producer? and the lead up to the Japanese release made fun watching too. Some of it just to get a little peek into the life/hard work/mad stresses behind making the film. I gave it a 10.",

It bothers me that western audience excuse is 'they don't get it'.

719,20 September 2002,Mooviez,10, Really amazing fantasy.,"It's really interesting.  Princess Mononoke was so amazing that it forced me to seek out and see as many of Miyazaki's other films as I could get my hands on.  This wasn't as easy as it sounds, since even though Disney owns the American distribution rights to all his earlier Studio Gibli works, they keep not releasing most of them. However, after watching a number of his films, I really came to love and appreciate what Miyazaki does as a film maker, and to really be in awe of his talent and mastery of dramatic story telling. I awaited this film's release in the U.S. with much anticipation, and I got the chance to see it last night at an advance screening here in L.A.  I wasn't disappointed. There are many review on here, so I'm not going to go into plot details, but I'd like to say, in response to some other user comments that I didn't find the story structure episodic at all, but rather extremely tightly crafted, with not a wasted beat.  Everything was setup and paid off beautifully, and the story structure blossomed like a flower.  We were transported deeper and deeper into this beautiful universe out of Miyazaki's imagination, and allowed to see such amazing things. I was particularly moved by both the polluted river and the train transporting dead souls.  Both poetic anthropomorphisms were subtly expressed, and masterfully expressed. Ten out of ten.  One of the best films I've seen in awhile.",

They discover that it is inhabited by monsters and spirits who visit there for relaxation and now the parents have turned into pigs leaving the girl at the mercy of these creatures-some of them actually being quite kind. I can't emphasize this enough, but the animation in this picture is amazing. It might possibly be the best ever made but the visuals aren't the only appealing thing about this picture. The story really is all about growing up and how alien it can be. Going through the same process myself, I can relate to the character very easily and I wanted her to be able to get through this whole thing alright. I would recommend this movie not just for cinephiles but everyone honestly. It's a great film that anyone of just about any age can enjoy.",

It has one of my favourite motifs and settings of any Ghibli film and. The first act is a little slow and the dialogue could be better at times but is almost flawless 9.8/10.,
725,21 December 2022,kingsholmen,1, The worst movie i've ever seen,"Wow this... I dont like this. Its the worst of all anime i've ever seen. Studio Ghibli have made better movies. MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. Every time i see it it becomes worse. I prefer movies like pokemon, Shrek, monsters inc, Dragon ball battle of gods and other anime movies i dont remember right now. But spirited away is definitely not as them. I want to see movies like Princess mononoke, grave of the Fireflies, my neighbor Totoro and your name. I think video brinquiédos ratatoing, the little panda fighter and Whats up is better than spirited away. When i saw spirited away. Omg i was disappointed. I hope Studio Ghibli wont disappoint me again. I hate the characters and the buildings and everything else. I cant understand why this won an Oscar or why this movie has 8,6. Even better score than smitsv, upp, wall e, coco, toy story, httyd or shrek or monsters inc. The music and the animation is ok but nothing else is. Thats why i give it 1/10. I wish i could give 0/10. I will hopefully never see this movie again. But i will hopefully see more of studio Ghiblis movies.",

732,30 September 2002,Femme_for_Films,10, Touching and entertaining anime thrill ride,"I had waited in massive anticipation for this movie. As much as I loved Princess Mononoke, I felt that Hayao Miyazaki could do better. And I was so very right. This movie was beautiful and amazingly done. The dubbing has been some of the best I've seen in his films, and the voices match the characters perfectly. Yet again, Miyazki takes us into a magical world where spirits rule and man is regarded as basically a common animal. It is up to the brave and endearing Chihiro to save her parents in this strange place. I could go on forever about how amazing this movie is, but you should see it for yourself.",
733,3 April 2005,Dede1982,10, One word: Amazing,"I don't know where to begin describing a movie as powerful as this one. Well, I decided to watch this movie since I liked ""Princess Mononoke"". Normally, I'm not very much into animated movies but since they became more and more popular during the last years (e.g. ""Finding Nemo, ""The Incredibles"", etc.) I decided to watch this one as well. The result was just overwhelming. The artwork, the characters, the story, everything merges into one big piece of movie history. The most amazing thing about the movie may be the fact of its authenticity: I think everyone of us sees a bit of Chihiro in themselves. The struggle of growing up, being abandoned from ones parents for the first time, learning how hard work can be- only to name SOME of the problems Chihiro (and with her all of us) has to face. Miyazaki manages to combine all the morally important points with a great portion of humour and drama. Besides the story based perfection there is the great animation of the movie. In my opinion it's delivering the message better than the computer generated kind as it is presented in the movies I mentioned above. If you now think I exaggerated with this review, please, do me the favor and watch this movie. There are so many movies of utter stupidity and lack of intelligence nowadays. If you really want to see a movie that makes you think some longer than the 128 minutes you watch it, just watch it. This is not only a movie about growing up- it's also masterpiece that deserves some attention.",
734,24 September 2020,jonnathanchavezz,9, another animation great,Spirited away is so dense with themes and topics but over all its all in service to tell this coming of age story thats told amazingly. the world that miyazaki and team create is absolutely creative and beautiful. each character design is unique along with each location which on a visual level is just so rich in culture and if you do your research all adds this hidden subtext. the music is sweet and memorable. paired along with the gorgeous animation spirited away is just one of the greatest in animation and really there isn't anything new that is to be said here.,

736,30 June 2005,s-j-james,2, A massively overrated piece of work,"An over-mannered and terribly awkward movie - the plot struggles to cohere and the animation is by and large rigid and inexpressive (look at the faces of the witches, for instance). Worst of all, however, is the voice acting. The lead, especially, squawks in the most grating way imaginable; some of the more gifted members of the English-language cast do their best, but struggle with a very limited script and emotional range. There are a few flashes of style in the visuals, but this movie is a clumsy and unfortunate reminder of how far the animated genre still is from mature achievement even as long after 'Akira' - there are less acclaimed animations you would be better off renting instead.",

This is supposed to be movie industry, not some fancy art gallery therefore just because you liked the art style doesnt make it the best animated movie ever.

754,8 April 2020,a-65018,9, Strange and touching,"Mystical. Enchanting. A key to another world. There are so many ways to describe this movie. The movie focuses on a young girl who is trapped in a sort of ""spirit world"". When her mother and father are turned into pigs, young Chihiro has to save her parents before they're cooked and eaten. It may sound silly, but this tale has more to it than farm animals. When Chihiro is frightened, she runs off. When a boy finds her, he tells her that she must get a job at ""The Bath House"". A sort of retreat for spirits. But to do this, she must speak with Yubaba. The witch who rules The Bathhouse. After Yubaba agrees to give Chihiro some work. She takes her name away from her. And she is then called ""Sen"". While shes at the bath house, she is put under very hard work. I could say more, but that would be foolish of me. This is a great movie that I think people of all ages should see for themselves. Its an enchanting and heartwarming story that I've watched over and over again and have never gotten sick of it. It has been another inspiring movie from Haiyo Miazaki that is above all his best yet. A 10 out of 10 for this wonderful movie.",

A hallmark of a good storyteller is making the audience empathise or pull them into the shoes of the central character. Miyazaki does this brilliantly in 'Spirited Away'. During the first fifteen minutes we have no idea what is going on. Neither does the main character Chihiro. We discover the world as Chihiro does and it's truly amazing to watch. But Miyazaki doesn't seem to treat this world as something amazing. The world is filmed just like our workaday world would. The inhabitants of the world go about their daily business as usual as full with apathy as us normal folks. Places and buildings are not greeted by towering establishing shots and majestic music. The fact that this place is amazing doesn't seem to concern Miyazaki. ",

It lets you in to a magical world, and you forget about the real world till the end. It is so beautifully crafted that it is impossible to not respect and admire the artwork. The messages it gives are really good yet subtle, it doesn't scream them into your face.

768,8 June 2006,azzurra-ying,3, Eye candy to some extent but not memorable,"Maybe it's the dubbing (for it's the English version that I watched). I had high hopes this time that Japanese anime characters are going to be finally lovable, and it failed once again. The story wasn't too bad when Chihiro first got into the bathhouse and when all the funny, innovative characters, a lot of whom taken probably from traditionally Japanese legends and folk tales, are introduced. But most of them were simply introduced and left alone, not making any difference to what would go on. Perhaps the smooth and ""predictable"" story-telling of American animes that gives some significance to every character that they care to put in front of the audience is addictive. As for the main character Chihiro, I'm slightly consoled at her pretty much genuine appearance (small eyes, build and height of a child). However when the little boy comes in I sadly knew where this movie is going right away. There just can't be a proper Japanese anime without a hint of dubious relationship between their male and female pre-teen leads. And it's always just a hint, for the little girl and boy do seem to remain incredibly pure and innocent and righteous against all odds. Then again it might be the translation and dubbing - but when Chihiro finally learnt her lesson of ""love"" in the sky when flying with Haku, it truly made me wince and spoilt whatever innocent fun the movie offered earlier. The dark, childlike qualities of Japanese animes always make it difficult for me to believe that they are totally healthy.",

Here's a tip, if you think it's below average in the first 30 minutes, don't bother finishing it. It doesn't really pick up. Maybe it's because I don't understand Japanese and read the English subtitles. I just really didn't find this to be great.

I had heard a lot of good stuff about it but I was not expecting to be as blown away as I was. I remember that there were a couple of American reviewers on the DVD giving a short prologue before the movie started and they said something to the effect of ""if this is your first time watching this film, then we're really envious of you!"".

777,7 November 2006,Illyria2004,8, Outstanding vocal talent,"I actually admire Disney's moves to bring Miyazaki to the US. Purists will inevitably defend the authenticity of the original presentations but you can tell that Disney has invested significant effort into bringing great films such as ""Spirited Away"" to our neck of the woods. The vocal talent is amazing. I would probably like the subtitled versions just as much but I also have to give props to Disney for caring enough to pair this and other Miyazaki classics with distinguished vocal actors such as Gillian Anderson, Michael Chilkis, Phil Hartman, Suzanne Pleshette, and Christian Bale, just to name a few. I don't have a problem with subtitles and I would gladly watch the Miyazaki films as they were originally released but I beg to differ with anyone who has any qualms about Disney's dubbing. Whereas Disney's own animated films, sans Pixar, have been utterly mediocre (""Lilo and Stitch"" was probably its last best animated release), they seem to make up their failure through the incredibly successful importation of ""Spirited Away"" and its ilk.",

This was a visually stunning movie that immersed you into a world full of fascinating characters and fantastic settings. The music was majestic and perfectly suited this effortlessly perfect film. You can tell that the artists poured sweat and blood into this film, to make it is good as humanly possible. The plot was unique as well as all the characters. The characters are like nothing I've ever seen before and our written to perfection. Another thing I love about this film is the sense of mystery in this strange world. As the movie goes on you learn more about this fascinating world a bit like a jigsaw, bit by bit. Don't let the long runtime put you off, trust me every moment is filled with joy and heart. The uniqueness of the film allows it to possess the ability of it being memorable. I would 100% recommend this if you want to head into a beautifully crafted, intriguing world, full to the brim with magic and unique characters. This movie will certainly stand the test of time with its stunning animation which even today is still innovative, truly a movie ahead of its time.",

788,26 July 2006,bernie720,10, The Best Movie I've Ever Seen,"I give this movie a ten for a lot of reasons. First of, Spirited Away is about a girl named Chihiro who goes thru a tunnel and finds herself in a world full of spirits, witches, and people who can transmit themselves into different creatures. It's also about the love between two kids who save each other's life in different times and places.",
789,11 June 2005,Paintchain,9," Sen to Chiriro, a really beautiful film!","Yeah... Spirited Away, or Sen to Chihiro as they call it here. My DVD said Spirited Away. It's a Dutch version with Dutch dubs and original Japanese language on it. Also there are Dutch subs. I've only watched Japanese with Dutch subs. Two times. Yes... It was such a great films from Studio Ghibli's living legend Hayao Miyazaki. I love all his films. And I like most of the other films from Studio Ghibli too. Like Grave of the Fireflies... it's such a drama, really beautiful. But right... this is Spirited Away. It's a great film. You get a nice feeling when you watch it. It's a little bit dramatic, but you won't get down of it. It's some fantasy. There are creatures in it, like ghost. You won't see the difference between good and evil, 'cause the line between that is really vague. Some things look bad, but are good. It's a film who's loved by young and old. Even adults can enjoy the deep lying thoughts in it. I really recommit this. If you have watched this and liked it, but want some more action, you can try Princess Mononoke. It's also a Ghiblifilm, but with some more action. And if you haven't watched it yet, have fun!",
