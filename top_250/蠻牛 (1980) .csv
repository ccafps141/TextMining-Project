0,5 April 2004,MovieAddict2016,10, Essential masterpiece; powerful De Niro; simply one of the best films of all time.,"""Raging Bull"" isn't the average, stereotypical underdog boxing movie, because it isn't really about boxing at all. Like most great movies, its focus is much deeper. It came out in 1980, earned Robert De Niro a Best Actor Academy Award, and was marked down as another solid triumph by director Martin Scorsese, whose previous 1976 outing with De Niro earned them both critical acclaim (and for De Niro, an Oscar nomination, although he would actually earn an Oscar for ""Raging Bull"" four years later).",/

I didn't like the main character Jake who I thought was ignorant and insecure and I was glad things went bad for him towards the end.

6,25 November 2002,waltergl,10, It doesn't get much better than this,"Easily one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. I have watched it at least ten times, and it only gets better and better with each viewing. Martin Scorsese is absolutely the greatest filmmaker of the last quarter century, and this film is his best. The story of how boxer Jake LaMotta watched his career and marriage crumble under the weight of his violent temper and deep-rooted misogyny is told with no punches pulled (excuse the bad pun), as Deniro (in what may be his best performance) and Scorsese unflinchingly explore what drove this man over the edge, and what ultimately may have pulled him back. The boxing scenes easily rank with the most brutal and violent moments ever put on film, shot in stark, unadorned black and white and utilizing unlikely sounds including shattering windows and animal cries to great effect. Thelma Schoonmaker's jarring, discordant editing in these scenes also deserves special mention. The scenes of domestic violence are not for the faint of heart, but there is really no other way to tell this story. If there is a more perfect exploration of why as men we act the way we do, then I'd love to see it, because this movie made me re-evaluate my life. 10/10",w
7,24 September 2008,CihanVercan,9, It really is harder to Stay At the Top than to Reach the Top; just because Life has No Justice.,"Whoever is dissatisfied by Raging Bull, I'm sure they watched it with expectations of watching a sports movie, like Rocky. Despite the AFI chose Raging Bull as the #1 sports movie of all time, you can't expect to see the most breathtaking boxing match nor to witness the best crochet of boxing history. Raging Bull can only be classified as a drama/biography. Director Scorsese chose to go with black&white cinematography only to keep the young viewers away from this masterpiece of art. It's not fair to compare Rocky with Raging Bull. Rocky was a populist movie mostly for young viewers, and Raging Bull is a cinematic masterpiece. From a wide point of view, for instance, if you look at one of the Michelangelo's paintings; at first you see a nude woman, if you look longer and deeper you realize that her nudity expresses some thought, if you look continuously and give a life to it in your imagination you discover that the women are not just their bodies. Accordingly, like it is not enough looking once to a painting to understand what opinion does it defend; it is not reasonable and not fair to watch Raging Bull so as to see a sports movie. Also it is not reasonable to see Raging Bull only once. Raging Bull is one movie that, every time you watch it you get a better taste, every time you watch it you discover something new. ",/
8,4 August 2017,jonsefcik,5, Don't believe the hype,"I don't write reviews on IMDb very often, but this particular movie baffles me. How is this in the IMDb Top 250? The only positives I have are that it's well shot and does an excellent job portraying what it's like to be in the same room as a group of people with nothing good to say about each other. The acting is solid all around but nothing groundbreaking. Joe Pesci played Joe Pesci. I didn't find Robert Deniro's performance that amazing; yes he gained 60 pounds to play the retired LaMotta, but besides a lot of yelling, nothing about this universally lauded performance stood out to me. Speaking of yelling, about 70% of the movie is comprised of angry people yelling at each other. I guess all the characters are supposed to be unhappy, but that doesn't mean they all have to be unlikable. There's no reason to care about any of the characters since we hardly get to know them. Maybe the fact that a more relatable side of the characters is never displayed is part of what the film is going for thematically, but the presentation could have been a lot better. For these reasons, I found Raging Bull mostly boring and somewhat exhausting to sit through. I've at least liked every other Martin Scorsese film I've seen, but this one left me unsatisfied and with a sour taste in my mouth.",r

12,3 August 2005,Theo Robertson,8, A Great Film But ...,"Scorsese's RAGING BULL is rightly up held as a wonderful piece of film making . Robert DeNiro takes method acting to new heights . Yeah we've all heard the story about how he built his physique up by going to the gym and then after these scenes were filmed he did nothing but sit on his butt and gorge himself on junk food so he'd physically resemble the bloated and overweight Jake La Motta in later life , but this story is worth repeating again and again . Look at the scene where DeNiro uses the public phone box , he raises his arm to speak into the receiver and you can subtly see DeNiro's pot belly bulging out from his shirt . All the performances are good but DeNiro totally dominates the movie ",8
13,29 December 2006,mnpollio,4, Ostentatiously pretentious with a one-dimensional central character,"Certainly a contender for the most overrated film ever made. I like some of Martin Scorsese's work, but I have never understood the near hysterical reactions elicited by critics and his die-hard fans over his contributions to cinema which, much like Steven Spielberg, range from wonderful to embarrassing. To them, every Scorsese film is ""brilliant."" However, despite the reassurances of various critical associations and hero-worshipping fans all too willing to declare this the greatest film made in the last 30 years, most viewers may well wonder what all of the hoopla is about. The film is a biography of boxer Jake LaMotta and documents his volatile, tempestuous nature both in the boxing ring and in his personal life. There is no doubt that Robert DeNiro hurls himself heart and soul into this role, but much of the accolades heaped onto his work center on the arduous physical labors he endured to get himself into fighting shape for LaMotta at his prime and then make himself fat to depict LaMotta having gone to seed. One must admire his dedication, but it was hardly the first time an actor had gone to such efforts  people quickly forget the weight gains of actresses such as Elizabeth Taylor for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf or Lynn Redgrave in Georgy Girl more than a decade prior to DeNiro in Raging Bull. Ironically, other than the physical, there is nothing to recommend LaMotta as a character around whom a movie should be centered. He greets every obstacle in his life, either person or event, by trying to batter it into bloody submission. There is no range to him and he is most certainly not a charismatic person. I certainly would not wish to spend more than a few moments in his presence much less the duration of this film, which ultimately depicts LaMotta as little more than a not especially intelligent, violent pugilist. The profane dialog is anything but memorable and the people who surround LaMotta are little more than ciphers. The film is brutal and often hard to watch, more so because of its pretense rather than brutality. Scorsese films the whole thing in stark black and white and choreographs some of the boxing footage with mournful classical music. All of these touches seem to indicate a serious subject of near biblical importance  but that subject most definitely is not seen on screen in the guise of LaMotta. Joe Pesci pretty much contributes his stock Joe Pesci performance as Jake's brother. The film's biggest attempt at humor comes at the expense of Cathy Moriarty, a whiskey-voiced actress who resembles a 30-year-old vamp but who the film initially tries to pass off as a virginal 15-year-old(!). To her credit, she gets past that initial hurdle and makes Vickie LaMotta the only sympathetic character in the film. Raging Bull is by no stretch a bad film, but it is a criminally overrated one done in by ostentatious pretentiousness and an unsympathetic central character who (no matter how amazing the actor's physical transformation) is nothing more than a one-dimensional thug.",4
14,9 February 2000,solitaryman2,10," The most important ""boxing-movie"" of all times","Jake La Motta's story is no doubt the best movie about boxing of all times together with Robert Wise's The Set-Up. Besides the legendary performance of Robert De Niro, there are many things in this film that will remain in my heart forever: the splendid black & white, the contrast between the slow moving scenes and the frenetic ones, the choice of the music and the sense of loss which entangles the whole movie. De Niro faces another ""born loser"" role (after Travis Bickle, John Rubin, Johnny Boy) and strikes again; Martin Scorsese is the most poetic director of the last 30 years.",7

""Rocky"" didn't fit the formula and neither does ""Raging Bull."" ""Rocky,"" I suspect, broke the mold not so much in the course of a search for originality but in order to leave the way open for a sequel. Or, as it turns out, about five or six sequels. But ""Raging Bull"" dispenses entirely with the formula and follows Jake LaMotta from early in his career to his ultimate degradation as an unfunny host at a seedy bar in New York.

20,16 February 2020,Ch4ndler_B1ng,10, Not only the best boxing movie...,"This is my second favourite movie ever made so let's just get right into it. Raging Bull is directed by the absolute master (that is) Martin Scorsese and stars (personally) my favourite actor, Robert De Niro, his film career is so diverse and brilliant, his role as, Jake LaMotta (former heavyweight champion) just adds a completely clean essence to the film. Based on a true story about 40's to 50's champ Jake LaMotta, a story of a middleweight champion who wants to be up there with the highest boxers but say he can't because he had ""girly hands"" (as he refers to them as). He wants to become a heavyweight champion and then we get Joe Pesci's performance which is absolutely iconic, however in this movie, Joe isn't the short-tempered one, Bob is. Constantly thinking that his wife is thinking of another man in bed while they're making out and thinks that there is something going on between her and his brother (spoiler alert, there is no chemistry). The score composed by Pietro Mascagni is absolutely iconic, it is something dreams are made of, the cinematography is absolutely damn amazing and I couldn't expect anything more perfect or flawless from a movie.

22,24 April 1999,coop-16,10, Misunderstood masterpiece.,"Martin Scorsese is on record as saying that he has not yet made a truly great film, something up to the standard of The Searchers, Citizen Kane, Eight and a Half, The Leopard, or The Red Shoes. Perhaps he's right. However, he can boast of at least one film that comes awfully close to that olympian standard, Raging Bull. When Scorsese made Raging Bull, he was seriously thinking of it as a terminal work. He was going to end his career in Hollywood, move to Italy, and make documentaries about the lives of the saints. For better or worse,He chose not to. Still, retirement WAS seriously on his mind, and because of that, Scorsese poured all his thoughts, all his feelings, all of his knowledge of cinema into this, one of the most troubling- and unforgettable films- ever made. I believe that I have seen Raging Bull nearly a dozen times, and I see new meanings and surprising nuances in it every time. Here I can offer only a few comments, both of which are paradoxical. The first is that Raging Bull is a very violent film about love; the second is that it succeeds in portraying Jake Lamotta because it is just as much about Marty Scorsese as it is about Jake LaMotta. There are  five love stories in Raging Bull. The first is the story of Joey Lamottas love for his dull-witted, stubborn, hot-tempered , 'crazy ' brother. The second is Vicky Lamottas equally passionate love for her brutish, insanely jealous husband.The third is the story of Jakes love of himself, which begins as a brutish, jealous, self-loathing, profoundly selfish love, and slowly and in a halting, confused way, becomes a very different self appraisal, the recognition that he is not an ANIMAL, but a man. The Fourth love is that of Marty Scorsese himself, both for the film medium  and for the characters in his best films. The fifth may sound crazy, but I think it is present throughout the film. It is the love of God.It would take a lot more space than I have here, but  I would assert that Raging Bull DOES NOT portray a world in which God is absent; God even loves someone as brutish, as short-sighted, as vulgar and as morally obtuse as Jake. Indeed , Scorsese has even claimed that Jake comes close to God without realizing it. My second claim is that Raging Bull is autobiographical. But, in a sense, almost all of Scorsese's films are, whether directly or indirectly. For me , Raging Bull is autobiographical in that Marty is, to a large extent, reflecting himself in Jake. Scorsese, the ""gangster-priest' is confessing his sins and exorcising his demons. In this way, he is inviting all of his viewers to undertake a similar act of self examination, confession, and exorcism. This is one ( but not the only one) of the reasons that Raging Bull ends with a quote from Johns Gospel and a dedication to Haig Manoogian, who taught Marty how to look into himself and see.",_
23,9 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, Another one of Scorsese's finest,"What can I say about Raging Bull that hasn't been said already? I can safely say that Raging Bull is one of Scorsese's best. It is very hard-hitting and perhaps not for all, but it is for me one of the best sports films out there. The photography is gorgeous and so skillful yet claustrophobic and the score adds to the atmosphere. Once again, Scorsese's direction is superb, while the writing is top-drawer, the pace is spot on and the storytelling is ceaselessly compelling with brutal yet spectacular fight sequences. The acting is perfect from all, Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriaty are very, very good. But Robert DeNiro is just mesmerising as Jake, really he is. Overall, just wonderful and one of the best from a great director and actor. 10/10 Bethany Cox",=
24,21 January 2002,JVe5462530,10, There is a reason why they are referred to as the greatest....,"From my understanding, before this film was made, Martin Scorsese, arguably America's greatest filmmaker, was at the end of his rope. He was about to call it quits. His good friend, arguably America's greatest film actor, Robert De Niro, approached him with a book he had read. The title of the book was Raging Bull. After some coaxing, Robert finally convinced his friend to do the film, and it resulted in a MASTERPIECE!!!!!",t

26,16 April 2011,classicsoncall,9," ""The man's got a head of rock"".","You can take Tommy Como's (Nicholas Colasanto) description (above) of Jake La Motta a couple of different ways. La Motta could take a punch like no one else, evidenced by the kitchen scene when he had brother Joey (Joe Pesci) bang away at him trying to prove a point. On another level, La Motta was savaged by his inner demons, making him a tortured, animalistic man who inveighed his wife (Cathy Moriarty) with repeated abuse. Something as picayune as choosing between a cheeseburger and a piece of cake was enough to set him off the deep end. It's Robert De Niro's depiction of La Motta's life outside the squared circle that makes ""Raging Bull"" such a triumph of film making. Not so much a boxing picture as one with boxing in it, the movie explores the depths of one man's depravity and deep seated insecurity that makes him an animal both inside and outside the ring.",_

But I had never gotten around to even seeing a movie by Scorsese, although I'd heard great things about him.  You can imagine how excited I was to see that Raging Bull was number 2 on the Sight and Sound director's poll, and ranked the best movie of the 80s.  I was gung ho.  I was hoping to add Scorsese to my list of favorites.  But then, I actually saw Raging Bull.  I cannot for the life of me understand the glowing praise about this movie.  Is it a bad movie?  No.  It's just nothing special.  Scorsese's technique is, if anything, showy.  De Niro and Pesci are wonderful actors, there's no denying that.  But the movie as a whole just isn't particularly good.  I can find nothing about this movie that would bring it even close to the accolades it has been given.  Believe me, I wanted to like this movie.  I thought it would be great and then some; equal to the Searchers or 2001, from the praise it got; but it was uninteresting.

There are some classic scenes in here... but the movie as a whole just doesn't sustain itself for over 2 hours. Robert DeNiro portrays real-life boxer Jake LaMotta and apparently gained something like 60 pounds to portray him in his declining years. Sure, he plays the character and his foibles for all they're worth... but the movie doesn't really give us any reason to care about the man. He constantly mistreats the people close to him... his brother, his wife, his girlfriend... after a while it just seems to be the same thing over and over. Certain scenes do stand out... and the fights are visually impressive... but I can watch Scorsese's best movies over and over and never feel bored. I can't say that about this particular film.

While these genres have lived on in contemporary movies, the 1960s were the arrival of films with a profound boldness. Discretion was tossed to the wind and subtly was thrown to the wind. This advent of risqué film making was the beginning of a new era, marked predominately by unrestricted sexuality and violence. This has continued on to this day, but certain periods were peaks in these categories. On one end of the stick is a cult horror film like The Evil Dead (Sam Raimi, 1981), which is infamous for its over-the-top gore. Other films, such as Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull (1980) struck viewers with heart pounding realistic violence.

The film has been beautifully-shot by cinematographer Michael Chapman, utilizing every visual and visceral trick in the cinema manual, and Robert De Niro deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar for his amazing, high-wire performance in the lead--even putting on the extra weight for Jake's latter-day scenes. But the movie is mired in sordidness, and Scorsese clearly relishes rubbing our faces in the dirty laundry. The filmmaker's artistry is undeniably vast, yet he fails to lift his picture up on an emotional level and, very soon, one feels like a boxer in the ring, being pummeled. Thelma Schoonmaker also won an Oscar for her editing, which is amazing in the boxing sequences but, later, when Jake is retired and tries his hand at being a lounge lizard, the scenes are allowed to drag on to an inevitable finish.",

And that's this film's finest accomplishment in that Jake LaMotta isn't a nice guy (which is putting it lightly), and yet seeing him fail is no less painful or easy to witness.

Fearing of not being manly enough. Oh yeah: this is a modern movie abut masculine insecurity at total display. which is completely amazing in this piece is that those securities seemed to be what made him winning so much. The rage filled with a bottle because ""men don't cry, men don't show weakness"". There's a scene whehn la motta cries and i believe he's crying not only because what happened but also for not being strong enough for not crying.",
43,13 March 2016,ironhorse_iv,9, Rage on! Raging Bull is a masterpiece. A very unique and entertaining watch.,"After finishing reading boxer, Jake LaMotta's memoir, 'Raging Bull: My Story"", I have to say the movie adaptation of this emotionally story of a self-destructive boxer, Jake LaMotta's (Robert De Niro) journey through life, as the violence and temper that leads him to the top in the ring, and but also hurt his private life outside it, is a brilliant black and white bio-pic. It's crude, harsh, and shocking – with its use of violence and adult-driven profanity though not as shocking as in an earlier draft of the screenplay by screenwriters, Paul Schrader & Mardik Martin, which show a lot more of Jake's bad side. Some good examples are when Jake is seen kicking and punching, a pregnant woman. Another one, not explained in the film, is the fact that La Motta had been a petty criminal, during his teen years, and he only learned boxing while in reform school. During much of his boxing career, Jake often feared that the law enforcement would be found out that he killed a local bookie during a failed robbery attempt, and he believed that he would ""pay for"" what he did, one way or another. La Motta would later, find out later in his boxing career, he had badly hurt the bookie, but didn't killed him. Nevertheless, I think the part of his story would had made the film, so much better. Despite that, most of the film changes does work, such as La Motta's fights, removal of La Motta's father, and the reduction of organized crime's role in the story. One of the better changes, was the merger of the characters of La Motta's friend, Pete Savage with that of his brother, Joey La Motta (Joe Pesci). Directed by Martin Scorsese, the movie is also well-shot. I love the use of slow moment in the black and white principal photography. I like how each of the boxing scenes was choreographed for a specific visual style. The fight scenes are very impressionistic. Even the color scenes were fine. I love how La Motta's color family home movies, really look real & personally. Just the fact, that these sequences were personally scraped by Martin Scorsese with a coat-hanger to ensure a rough, naturalistic feeling, made the film, so much better. I love how Scorsese seems to have lifted the film's distinctive look and feel directly from La Motta's autobiography. However, I glad Martin didn't follow with La Motta's style in which this movie was to be played for him. After all, La Motta's idea of jerky movements, with huge gaps. A string of poorly lit sequences, some of them with no beginning and some with no end with no musical score would be a little too unwatchable. Instead, the movie is well-paced, well shot, and has tons of beautiful classical music from 19th century, composer Pietro Mascagni and 1940/1950s jukebox. In my opinion, I think, it's one of Martin Scorsese's greatest movies. It's surprising to hear today, that this movie was almost the director's last movie. After nearly dying from a drug overdose in the 1970s, Scorsese agreed to make the film for Robert De Niro's sake. Not only did, this movie save Martin's own life but also to save what remained of his career. It really did redeem the director's life. Talking about career changing. This film almost made Robert De Niro into a bigger star. Preparation for his boxing role, Robert De Niro went through extensive physical training, then entered in three genuine Brooklyn boxing matches, just show how well-trained, he got. Surprising, De Niro won two of the bouts. If that wasn't enough, Robert De Niro is infamous for this film, for gained a record 60 pounds to play the older Jake LaMotta. What a remarkable performance from him. Even supporting actors like Joe Pesci did well. This was a breakout role for Pesci, a singer, comedian, and former child-actor. He had been in only one film before this, and nearly decided to quit acting before he was asked to play Joey. It pretty much, save Joe Pesci's career. Overall: Raging Bull had cemented its reputation as a modern classic, both with the critics and with general audiences. The use of gorgeous black-and-white photography mixed with great acting continue to evoke viewers even today's world. It's a must-watch for anybody who loves movies.",
44,9 December 1999,filmman1_,10, As perfect as perfect can be.,Raging bull is my favorite film. Robert de Niro's performance in this film is truly amazing and the direction from Scorsese and the script from Paul Schrader are flawless. The fight scenes are the most brutal that I have ever seen on film even though theres only like 12 minutes of them and the editing is simply brilliant. It should have earned Scorsese a best director oscar but at least they had enough sense to award de Niro the best actor oscar.,
45,13 July 2014,RossRivero99,10, Scorsese's boldest film yet,"Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull is not just a boxing movie, or a man who talks about sex as a joke, but it is the story of the life of Jake La Motta (played by Robert De Niro) who uses his anger and rage in and out of the ring. De Niro plays La Motta with brilliance but in order to play him he had to learn how to box first, both De Niro and Pesci give their career's best performances that really deserved Oscars for their wonderful work, especially Cathy Moriarty for her well played performance as La Motta's 2nd wife. Scorsese has made a masterpiece out of this film that tells us how Jake La Motta was in real life and how he would destroy his life out of the ring. The movie also deserved a lot more academy awards than it actually got, but it deserved best actor for De Niro (for which it actually won), best picture, best director, best supporting actor, best supporting actress, best sound editing, and best cinematography. On an episode of Siskel & Ebert where they both selected this film as the best movie of the 1980's I absolutely agree with them but Siskel included another true statement that said ""After you're done watching this movie you feel like you actually know that person."" and I did feel as if I knew him in real life.",

Easily the most brutal fight scenes ever filmed. Three of my favorite actors DeNiro, Pesci, and Vincent hook up for the first time under Scorsese's brilliant directing. Robert DeNiro's weight gain for the late scenes in the film remain as a testament to his acting and performing ability. DeNiro does such an acting job in this that he makes me do something I never thought possible, he makes me hate Robert DeNiro. The ""hit me again"" scene is classic. This is a great movie but I still think DeNiro was better in Taxi Driver.",
49,17 February 2020,andrewroy-04316,8, A great character study and filmmaking knockout,"Raging Bull is a great representation of the intense, character-driven dramas of De Niro and Scorsese. We see Lamotta's dreams and aggression in the ring, but also his ultimate failure to balance that aggression in day to day life. It masquerades as a more traditional sports movie, and deserves to be praised in those scenes, as the matches were extremely well edited. The real angle of the movie is revealed more gradually: it's really a film about jealousy and fear of sexual inadequacy, and how that self-doubt manifests into lashing out at others, particularly his wife. Moriarty is fantastic as a confident, poised young woman who grows to love and then fear her unstable husband. De Niro and Pesci are both fantastic, and their brotherly relationship is completely convincing. The ending is tragic, as it is painful but fitting to see him in the Florida jail asking why. It doesn't feel groundbreaking now, but that's because of the vast influence it had in the intensity of sports dramas and the classic rise and fall biopic story.",
50,17 November 2019,CubsandCulture,10, Might not be his best but this is my favorite Scorsese film.,"I often struggle to connect with Scorsese's work on an emotional level. I find his films curiously intellectualized and given his interest in watching men destroy themselves I just don't get a lot from them. This fine film is an exception. Some of it is the genre-boxing film-is one of my favorite genres and Scorsese's direction is classical and restrained (most of the time) that makes the film feel like a traditional Hollywood film. The black and white really helps with this; swearing aside this feels like a 40's film. Indeed, re-watching it the other day it struck me as a more realistic version of a Requiem for a Heavyweight; it has the same somber fatalism to the proceedings.",

In fact, Mr. La Motta seems to have been a violent, abusive man.During the film, Mr. La Motta, beats on opponents in the boxing ring, beats on his wife, beats on strangers, beats on his own brother, and beats on cement walls.Jake La Motta isn't the only violent member of the family. Jakes brother Joey(Joe Pesci) commits an extremely brutal assault against a stranger just for talking with his brothers wife. Its fine to make biographical films about less than noble people, but there should be an underlying lesson.All I learned from ""Raging Bull"" is that Mr. La Motta was a violent, abusive jerk.",

It is also the best boxing movie ever made, and it is a movie that will forever be remembered by American audiences. Martin Scorsese's film tells the true story of the unhinged boxer, Jake LaMotta (who passed away last year at the ripe old age of 95). He was a boxer who punched hard, harder, and hardest, and he went all out in the boxing ring. Outside of the ring, he was a vulnerable man especially when it came to women. He believed women to be precious virgins for his own making, and only he can take away their virginity.

Scorsese crafts some of the most iconic shots and sequences ever put to film in this epic boxing drama. The style of the film is wholly unique and still has not been topped. Robert DeNiro gives another one of the best performances of the century and completely becomes the tragic Jake LaMotta. His story is fascinating, yet difficult to watch. Raging Bull is an all-time classic and one you shouldn't miss.",
65,10 January 2006,JoshtheGiant,9, A Raging Film,"Martin Scorsese is a wonderful director and although he has had the occasional bad film such as Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore or Gangs of New York but has also had many amazing films such as this Ragin Bull which may actually be his best slightly above such masterpieces as Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, and Casino. Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances as Jake La Motta. He is phenomenal and deserved his Best Actor Oscar, although he has been better in both Taxi Driver and The Godfather Part 2. But the best performances are in the supporting categories by Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty, Moriarty in particular is wonderful. She gives one of the best performances in film history and blows everyone else out of the water. The screenplay is also wonderfully written with flawless dialogue and some of the best character development since Casablanca. The boxing scenes are wonderfully shot and are possibly the best boxing scenes ever shot. Raging Bull is without a doubt one of the best films ever made. You must see it!",

68,15 February 2012,romanorum1,10," The Best Movie of 1980, and Even of the 1980-89 Decade","During World War II, when death and destruction are rampart, a different kind of war rages inside the mind of an American boxer. Jake LaMotta, perhaps more comfortable inside the ring than outside, has personal demons to battle. For his nature is one of insecurity and jealousy and self-destructiveness. It is by rage, and by rage alone, that drives the great fighter. Look at his ring rejoinder after his second wife Vickie states that a particular fighter (Tony Janiro) is ""good-looking."" Wham! There was another, external quandary: the rackets. They controlled who fought whom. And boxing decisions are often problematic. In Raging Bull's first fight scene, we see the undefeated Jake LaMotta crushing Jimmy Reeves in the ring but not getting the decision, apparently because of a fix (1941). In a subsequent fight he would knock out Reeves (1943). Nevertheless Jake LaMotta had to relax his own ring ""moral"" standards (!) and play ball with the mob as urged by his brother. Only after he throws a fight to Billy Fox in 1947 (TKO in the 4th) and paid some cash, was he given a shot at the Middleweight title. He made the most of it when he defeated Marcel Cerdan (1949). But then again, a new problem arose: Would he have the hunger to maintain the belt? By the way, LaMotta's career did not end with his last loss to Sugar Ray Robinson (1951), as he had ten more fights. When he did retire in 1954, he had lost his title, wives, and money, although he had his jokes (and there would be more wives). It was his stand up comedy routine which later sustained him.",

This movie is about the downward spiral of boxer Jake La Motta, who due to his jealousy and temper issues alienates all those close to him. With the objective of becoming the middleweight champion, Jake is angry, stubborn and always finds a reason to start arguing. Robert De Niro gives his career best performance that earned him his second Oscar. La Motta is a despicable human being that mistreats his wife and nearly murders his brother. However with De Niro's own mark, one can see that this man isn't all bad. He manages to conquer his girl by being sweet and caring, while also sharing a deep connection with his brother Joey, at least until his dark side wins over. Speaking of Joey, Joe Pesci also delivers a poignant performance of Joey La Motta, who always tries to bring his brother to reason, until he can no longer help Jake. Complementing this movie's emotional strenght we see spectacular cinematography work and great boxing sequences that are as gripping as you can get. I have yet to see a better Scorsese movie. This is the one that always leaves me baffled and De Niro gives the 2nd best performance I have ever seen, only surpassed by Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood.

The huge disadvantage here is trying to tell the true story of a living person, Jake LaMotta. As portrayed herein, LaMotta was an extremely ignorant, extremely obnoxious, extremely ugly person. Robert DeNiro gained 60 pounds to portray LaMotta in late middle age: an Oscar-worthy effort. I can't understand why this is considered a great fight picture, since much of it consists of offering a resume that can be easily obtained by scanning a Wikipedia article in much, much less than the 129 minutes this movie requires. Unlike much better boxing stories, like ""Champion,"" ""Fat City,"" ""The Set-Up,"" or ""The Champ,"" there's nothing and no one to root for, which would disappoint the most committed fan of ""the sweet science.""

In addition to DeNiro's benchmark acting performance, this film has some of the most outstanding cinematography that has ever been seen. The fight scenes are like ballet; for example, using the Air on a G String as the two fighters pummel one another. This is true genius. We get to see the humanity of LaMotta, a complex, somewhat violent man, carefully configured before our eyes.

89,30 January 2003,LagerLagerLagerShouting,9, A Classic.,"How did this film only win two Oscars? (Deserved ones at that!) It is easily won of the best films in the 80's and with hindsight everyone gives this classic the recognition it deserves. I do not know much about boxing but I can understand from Raging Bull the brutality of life in the ring and how it effects people, like Jake LaMotta in their normal lifestyle. My all time favourite actor, Robert De Niro, masterfully portrays LaMotta as a determined character whose aggression and brutality that he he feels in the sport transcends into his life. In the final monologue he is almost a fallen hero as he wonderfully conveys his life in a passioned soliloquy. Scorsese uses classic film-making techniques, in depth, almost psychological, characterisation and sudden bursts of conflict, retribution and remorse to make the film very human indeed. Ultimately this is character driven drama at its finest and more this helps the film to flow excellently through the contrasts of LaMotta's domestic violence with his professional violence, which as brutal as it is, is not played for hatred but questions morality and on a deeper levels strives to be sympathetic. What also helps the relationship of the characters is the improvising, especially between DeNiro and Pesci. They argue and fight with great conviction and DeNiro especially is very believable (probably due to the amount of time he pent with LaMotta!)",

91,20 March 2015,lesleyharris30,8," One of De Niro's Most Powerful Performances,","Raging Bull is a great movie with a really well developed storyline and a terrific cast. The movie is mostly a great watch because of Robert De Niro's absolutely outstanding performance, he owns this character from start to finish, delivering an honest, sincere and real role that makes it very clear why he is one of the most successful actors of all time. I honestly don't think it comes near to be being Martin Scorsese's best film, it is very character driven, more so than the majority of his films are, which is fine but it isn't entirely exciting the whole way through, delivering little of the violence I've come to expect from Scorsese. Stunning performances and a superb script, I would recommend Raging Bull to anyone looking for a good sports drama. ",

95,20 July 2001,Spleen,4," A more restrained, less full-throated bull than I'd expected","Here, in a nutshell, is why ""Raging Bull"" must renounce its claim to being a great movie: Jake's monologue at the end.  It was lifted word for word from ""On the Waterfront"".  It's not plagiarism: Jake is quoting, and we know he's meant to be quoting, from a movie he's seen, but that's the problem - those quotation marks.  Had they been FAKE quotation marks, had Jake been quoting some non-existent movie, all might have been well.  Had there been NO quotation marks, all might have been well.  (It's not Scorsese's fault if the most fitting words Jake could possibly utter turn out to have already been used back in 1954; if the words fit seamlessly into his movie just as well as into the earlier one, he should simply steal them, and leave the attribution of credit for the fine print at the end.)  The trouble is that when it comes time for a moment of truth ""Raging Bull"" is unable to speak for itself.  Its reach exceeds its grasp - it's as simple as that.",
96,16 February 2006,Sylviastel,10, A Classic Film by even today's standards!,"Martin Scorsese, Joe Pesci, and Robert DeNiro: When these guys get together, you know something big is going to happen and this film is a perfect example of great quality. Raging Bull is Jake LaMotta's rise and fall as an athlete to a nightclub performer. I think this is the film that Joe Pesci shows that even little guys can cause the most harm. When DeNiro and Pesci play the La Motta brothers, you believe it because they have such great chemistry with each other. I don't think Pesci was ever intimidated by Scorsese or DeNiro. This film earned DeNiro his second Academy Award and you can see why. Not only is the transformation, physical but emotional and psychological as well. These characters are flawed, human, and believable with great cast of actors. Don't forget Cathy Moriarty who was discovered to play Jake's young second wife. Even at 18, she can play younger and older and believable. His second wife can be beautiful and smart but trapped in a fractured marriage. She deserved her Academy Award Nomination for Best SUpporting Actress because she can handle herself against DeNiro and we see how he fell in love with her. Don't forget Pesci's wife is played Theresa Saldana who does hold her own. This film shows that black and white can still be beautiful film work. Nicholas Colasanto from Cheers is also in the film as well in a small role. Scorsese's best films are with DeNiro and Pesci at least in my opinion. At the end of the film, I wanted to know more about these characters.",

Di Nero pulls no punches as he gives one of the most unsympathetic portrayals of an actual living person ever shown on screen.

It may or may not be, as many critics have claimed, the best Hollywood feature of the 1980s(actually, it was released in the last year of the 1970s), but the visceral impact of the film is undeniable. Some people may (understandably) not see many virtues in a biography of middleweight champ Jake LaMotta, a man so filled with violence and jealousy that he tormented everyone, including himself, both in and out of the ring. But through Scorsese's fluid direction and Robert De Niro's intense (almost frightening) performance a portrait emerges of a beast who, beneath the rage, is at least halfway human, if never entirely sympathetic. It may not be a pretty picture (despite the stunning black and white photography and Oscar winning editing), but it's certainly a powerful one. Surprisingly, De Niro himself wrote the (uncredited) final, decisive draft of what, before, was a trouble-prone (for obvious reasons) screenplay.",
99,4 December 2016,cdjh-81125,8, A Scorsese Film About A Lot More Than Just Boxing,"I'm no boxing fan so I can't honestly say that I was dying to see this movie until I learned that Scorsese himself is not a boxing fan but he wanted to tell this story so this intrigued me even more and after always hearing about the massive praise for Robert De Niro performance I have to say I was very impressed. I'm gonna start out by saying the cliché thing when talking about this movie, Robert De Niro is absolutely incredible in this film it's in my opinion the greatest performance he's ever given, through De Niros performance when see La Motta gradually becoming his title of being a ""Raging Bull"" and was a truly terrifying presence. The boxing scenes in this film are so real, Scorsese did such a good job directed this film he put you right in their to the point where you could feel the power of every punch and move made. Joe Pesci was so fantastic in this film he seemed like a real scumbag but was never over the top at his chemistry with De Niro was completely on point. La Mottas character arc was handled perfectly, you understood just how much of his humanity he was losing both physically and mentally to the point where you actually start to pity him while still fearing him at certain points. Now one of the most common things to find in a Scorsese film is a female love interest that comes to hate the protagonist and this film has this but works for this film as it added to character arc of La Motta and gave room for Cathy Moriarty to give such a great and damaged performance in this film. However if I am completely honest I don't quite like this film as much as everyone else does, I do have one of two minor issues with this film for one, I didn't think making this film Black and White really added anything to this film and at times was just distracting and I think that the portion of the film that focuses LaMottas success in the ring is to short, the film montages over his major successes and does subtract some What from the intensity of the final fight. However I do think that the last act of this film was very effective as it got away from the boxing and focused on the characters aftermath of his time in the ring and we go from despising LaMotta to as I said sympathising with him and I truly thought that De Niro pulled it of perfectly.

100,13 May 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, A different kind of 'boxing movie'; sombre yet vivid and ferocious.,"'Raging Bull (1980)' differs from most 'boxing movies' in a few ways, most of all how it charts a career instead of the build-up to a single, make-or-break bout and places its emphasis on the tumultuous home-life of the man wearing the gloves as opposed to his time in the ring. Indeed, the boxing sequences - which are vivid, vicious and ferociously energetic - make for less than ten minutes of this picture's screen-time. Though much of its focus is on the jealous, controlling and generally abusive side of Jake La Motta, the eponymous raging bull, the flick doesn't actually delve all that deep into his character, even though it does a good job of portraying him for who he was - or who the filmmakers saw him to be, at least. In this way, we get a character study done from afar, almost like we're a fly on the wall and given the backstage access our protagonist was so keen to keep journalists from getting. We aren't told anything about the stone-faced protagonist but rather shown it and allowed to make up our own minds, which is a common thread through Scorsese's work. The piece is sometimes slow, but never boring, and usually entertaining. It is also quite sombre, in the end. It is wonderfully constructed and well-conceived, easily becoming one of the best in its sub-genre, and its boxing sequences (refreshingly shot from inside the ring) are some of the best in cinema. 7/10",
101,11 February 2000,Colonel Ted,10, A compelling study of an unlikeable man,"There are quite a few films that I could mention where the lead characters are wholly unlikeable and because they have no audience appeal, the film suffers greatly. Raging Bull is NOT one of those films. Robert De Nero puts in one of the best performances of his career as middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta. And LaMotta is not a nice chappie at all. Arrogant, rude, abusive, paranoid and obsessive are just some of the more complementary words I can think of to describe him. Yet extraordinarily this enhances rather than detracts from the film. Rather than hating him we feel deeply sorry for him because he was a man who had everything and then lost it through his own selfishness and personal insecurity. Director Scorsese's camera work is brilliant, with the boxing scenes some of the most vivid (not to mention graphic) ever filmed, all impeccably edited by Thelma Schoonmaker. The performances are all superb: Pesci as LaMotta's brother and Moriarty as his wife but especially De Nero as the self-destructive LaMotta himself. Raging Bull is the first Scorsese film that I have seen to date. On this basis I shall be seeing many more.",
102,1 September 2005,Tucker2007,4, Not too great,"I'll sum the whole movie up for you: 75% of the movie is wife beating and screaming. 25% is boxing reenactments. Jake lamotta isn't a hero, but more of a villain. I couldn't really connect with his character, because whenever he got a chance to talk, he screamed at everyone. Boxing didn't seem to be a big part of his life either, there were never any scenes where he was struggling with his career, or boxing was affecting his life in any way. You might as well make a movie documentary on joey buttafuco. This movie wasn't any good in my opinion. And when I hoped that he would come to his senses, he doesn't. I guess it's also hard for me to connect seeing as I didn't know who Jake lamotta was until I watched this movie. If you like wife-beating new yorkers who constantly yell. Watch this movie.",
103,21 August 2013,Red-Barracuda,9, Not your typical boxing movie,"This was a film that Robert De Niro wanted to make. Martin Scorsese initially thought the idea of making a boxing picture was an awful one. He hates all sports and had zero interest. But De Niro eventually won him over once Scorsese was able to see beyond the boxing and into the character beyond. Raging Bull is, like all the best sports films, only peripherally about the sport itself and is in reality a character study. And what an atypical man to base a drama around. The script came from Jake La Motta's memoirs. It is uncompromisingly about an unlikable violent man. La Motta was a middleweight boxing champion. Violent in and out of the ring and dangerously paranoid and insecure, he was brutal and animalistic. He actively enjoyed the fact he could take a beating and was very self-destructive – he ultimately went from world champion to sleazy nightclub owner. His story isn't uplifting like most sports dramas. It's harsh and unflinching. There are no typical underdog boxing movie moments or montages in this one.",
104,6 February 2013,ashi-lance,10, Raging Bull (1980): The rise and fall of Destructive Boxing Sensation,"""Raging Bull"" clearly ranks as one of the better films of all-time due to it's compelling story of the rise but yet human tragedy downfall at the end. At it's time when done in 1980 the cinematography was fabulous the film's black and white take was a neat and nice concept. Plus the Martin Scorsese does a fine job with the directing as his theme of character study and development into downfall is perfectly done. One could say ""Raging Bull"" is about boxing, but it's really about how boxing for one particular boxer shaped and affected his life in positive and ultimately demising ways. Being cautious to call this a sports drama, boxing does play an integral role in the movie without question. It simply goes to show the deeper human stories behind some of the world's greatest athletes and how it's not simply all about hard work and overcoming the odds. There are more themes in the world of sports than just that. It doesn't have to come down to who is going to triumph in the end. In ""Raging Bull,"" you couldn't care less if he wins or loses, you just want to see how it affects the rest of life of DeNiro. Robert DeNiro gives a tough and fired up performance as former real life and ex boxer middleweight Jake LaMotta, the film showcases Jake's life and career from the early 1940's till his washed up downfall as a low rent club owning stand up comedian in the early 1960's. The scenes are memorable not just the boxing ones but, the scenes of rage and blow ups from the LaMotta character. Joe Pesci gives a strong performance as LaMotta's brother Joey, he always gives encouragement and advice in an aggressive and upbeat manner, really one of the better supporting roles ever done by him. This movie is a great character study of rage, anger, and obsession just wanting to make your dream happen, but it proves many times that a downfall in the end happens can be sad and tragic. Overall good work from all involved especially Scorsese and DeNiro with a great supporting turn from Joe Pesci. What I liked most about the movie was the depiction of a person who did not hit the deserving note in life even though he carried enormous talent just because of the work ethics he carried. Definitely among Scorsese's best and still don't understand why it did not won an Oscar and losing to Ordinary people is beyond my imagination.",

What it's implied that boxing meant to Jake La Motta is a release of all the pent up frustration and insecurities that destroy his relationships.

It does indeed focus on the life of a boxer, but there is so much more to it then that. Rather than simply being a sports story of redemption, or something of the like, Raging Bull is one of the most startling and powerful portraits of stunted machismo ever captured on film. De Niro, following up on other such personas of tough guy losers, gives arguably his strongest performance here as Jake La Motta, who slowly but surely tore down everything he had managed to accumulate around him, including a marriage, relationships with all those close to him, and his hard won boxing career. De Niro is clearly the center of attention here, and he lives up to his reputation with wonderful flair, his performance is one of the most deserving of his Oscar in history. ",
112,5 February 2011,johnnyboyz,8, The film is brutal and brutally honest in equal measure; a terrifically terrifying slice of hard edged drama featuring a number of talents quite arguably at their peak.,"We begin with the titular Raging Bull gearing up before a contest, not one inside of ring but just prior to one of his stage duels in which he takes on the audience telling stories and anecdotes that pull in the crowds and the money. The man is Robert De Niro 's Jake La Motta; it's 1964, and after the brief practising of several lines to himself speaking of how he remembers every hit and every knock down and practically every detail of his in-ring boxing career, we dart back to 1941 to where it all began. With the benefit of hindsight, we're able to recall a number of other characters portrayed by De Niro in other Scorsese films in the form of Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, and the memorable monologues they brought about, before arriving at the conclusion this character we're observing here and now for the first time may very well be as disturbed as the other two in said examples. When La Motta speaks, there's a sense of specificity or intrinsics about the man's verbal confirmation of living his boxing life to the full, and the ability to take in the more minute details of what unravelled in the ring; Martin Scorsese's film eventually coming to resemble an inmost and often distressingly intrinsic study of this man's life from his young adult years to entering old age.",

While I agree that many of Scorsese's protagonists are questionable individuals, but Scorsese doesn't just use them and make them do reprehensible acts on screen just for the shock factor. He has always attempted to deeply study these characters.

He is absolutely magnificent as Jake LaMotta, a true bull of a man in and out of the ring. His sheer presence is overpowering, but he is competently underscored by an impressive supporting cast, especially Pesci as his tormented brother and Moriarty as his abused wife. The boxing sequences are as real as it gets, unflinchingly brutal and almost poignant. Behind all the ugliness of Raging Bull, though, lies beauty. The actions of LaMotta hardly evoke pity, but the film is so poetic and incredibly filmed that the movie is never so stark and perverse as to be unwatchable.

Now finally I have to say that I think Martin Scorsese is severely over rated and tries far too hard to make obscurity along with gratuitous violence, language, sex and anything else that can get a rise out of the average viewer.

Raging Bull is in a way a love story between La Motta and the second wife he takes (Very similar to Zampano's purchasing of his second girl). In the end, La Motta loses his youth and his act and once again is left with memories after breaking down from the loss of his true love.

Fighting in the ring, fighting with the judges, and most of all, fighting with himself. After the first match that we see him in, we see that Jake La Motta is just as much of a fighter with his gloves off as he is with them on, possibly even more so. His home life is very troublesome; with a marriage where every interaction results in an argument, and a brother/manager who only patronizes him even more, being a great boxer is not what he thought. With every winning decision, his life out from under the stadium lights becomes worse. He meets an 18-year-old girl, and her personality is, shall we say, flirtatious in a bad way. It doesn't take long for his jealousy and covetousness of his young wife soon becomes a major distraction, and as the middleweight title gets closer, so does his demise. Considered by most as one of the best sports movies of all time (alongside Field of Dreams, Rudy, Remember the Titans, and Hoosiers), Raging Bull is a great film not only about boxing, but also about a man who is a boxer. One major difference between this film and fellow boxing classic Rocky is that the movie shows more about life outside of the ropes than it does inside. With the total screen-time of actual bouts at roughly 15 minutes, the sport is simply the background to the story of La Motta. What this movie truly is about is a man who is unstable in his everyday life, and he struggles to keep himself from ruining his own career. In this film, Robert De Niro delivers one of the best performances not only of his career, but also possibly of all time. Famously gaining 60 lbs. to play the last part of this character's story, De Niro's performance as the real-life boxer La Motta brought the very intense story to the big- screen. As one of his two Oscar-winning performances, De Niro turned in everything he had, and came home with the deserved recognition. In addition to the Best Actor, Raging Bull also was nominated for Picture, Sound, Supporting Actor for Pesci, Supporting Actress for Moriarty, Director, Sound, Cinematography, and Film Editing, winning the last one. I personally thought that the sound, cinematography, and directing were definitely worthy of their Academy recognition. This film came 4 years after director Martin Scorsese's successful film Taxi Driver, which also featured De Niro. Like Taxi Driver, this film also incorporates the social ineptness of a man, and how this difficulty has an effect on the people around him. At some point between after 1976, Martin Scorsese had become severely addicted to cocaine, and an excessive dosage one day left him in a hospital room. While visiting his great friend, Robert De Niro brought up the idea of making a film based on a book that he had recently read about an old boxer. Though at first hesitant, Scorsese delved into the story of La Motta, and he made this classic as a result. Now I must remind you, this is a rated R movie, and it is deservedly so. As one may expect, the boxing sequences are pretty brutal, with blood and pain visibly flowing throughout. Outside of the ring, both Jake and Joey La Motta engage in many heated arguments, and the language within these scenes is R-worthy in itself. Though nothing is shown, Jake's wife Vicki is very ""friendly"" with people, and we hear about it in pretty specific detail. With these warnings listed, I still fully promote this film. This is truly a classic film, and if you are able to endure the violence and language, Raging Bull is a must-see for anyone interested in cinematic history. This is definitely a film that requires one's attention. It is not a movie that necessarily keeps the viewer on the edge of his/her seat, and it is more about the story. The pacing is slow at times, and it can lull for a small amount of time. I definitely loved this film, and I wholly recommend this film.",

It can be unpleasant to watch at times, and the film does a good job portraying Jake LaMotta as an unsympathetic character who's self destructive behaviour costs him his boxing career, his marriage to Vickie LaMotta (Cathy Moriarty), and almost his relationship with his brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) who is also his manager.",

I am convinced that Robert DeNiro delivers one of the greatest acting performances of movie history. He is literally up there with Marlon Brando and rightfully received the Best Actor Oscar of 1980. I am shocked that Raging Bull did not receive Best Picture. Maybe for its time, the language and sexual dialogue was not too appreciated. Don't let this deter you from seeing the movie.

Raging Bull is the saga of jealousy, sexual insecurity, hyper-masculinity and the manifestations of all these on a man who could have been a lot more than what he ended up being.
Shooting the entire film in black and white, Scorsese and Chapman have added a sense of authenticity to the movie timeline. This movie isn't about boxing, but about deeper conflicts which drive Jake LaMotta (played by De Niro) in his bouts. The fight scenes, well, they are never just about fights; they are where LaMotta confesses, punches, answers and channels all of him.
Terrific performances by the leads, particularly De Niro and Joe Pesci.

These people were a bunch of morally bankrupt lowlifes! And I sincerely doubt that anyone used the F-word in the 1940s as much as was featured in this film. What is it about so many movie makers that makes them think inclusion of the F-word somehow improves it? (just like so many standup comics of today) And the whole B&W thing! Just because color film is the norm doesn't mean making a movie in B&W somehow moves it out of the ""movie"" category and into the ""film"" category.

Many also put Raging Bull at the top of the list of the best pictures by Martin Scorsese. Personally, I think that Taxi Driver is Scorsese's best, and that Raging Bull is his second best. But it's still pretty close between them. Robert De Niro deserved his Oscar for playing Jake La Motta. I think that this is his finest piece of acting. I said in another review that I loved the fact that this film is black and white. I can not imagine it in color and the black and white texture seems to add so much to the story. It fits De Niro's character, who seems to only see things in black and white as he breaks down. It's interesting that the filming of Raging Bull in black and white was done because Scorsese realized that, after filming for a while, that the boxing gloves were the wrong color. They were red. They were supposed to be brown. So, on the spot, he decided to switch to black and white. Brilliant. Some of the greatest decisions are made due to small mistakes.

We get to see the rough, raw and rowdy story of LaMotta's(Robert De Niro)rise to the middleweight championship and his self-destructive exit from the glory and limelight. Great boxing scenes and unabashed emotional acting make this movie the masterpiece it is. De Niro is at the top of his game and probably plays one of his most memorable characters.

DeNiro said all of two things to Vicki and supposedly she wasn't a girl you ""F and leave"" but DeNiro did it with two phrases. He took a dive and got the championship and self destructed for no apparant reason. Why was this interesting? The story itself wasn't interesting and the movie didn't enhance the true story at all. Cathy Moriarty was attractive and nothing more. The rest of the characters other than the La Motta brothers added nothing and were drab and blah.

150,17 January 2014,Our_Feature_Presentation,9, Raging Bull,"This biopic about real life boxer Jake La Motta who is portrayed by Robert De Niro. The movie directed by, you guessed it, Martin Scorsese. The movie starts out with the greatest opening credits sequence of all time, it immediately sets you up for the mood of the movie, introducing you to the atmosphere set in black and white, the music, and Jake La Motta. He may not be speaking but just by the mannerisms you get the vibe of a cold heated, violent man, and in all honesty... he is a cold hearten violent man, you see this throughout the movie in another one of the greatest movie performances of all time again from De Niro. The other major characters are Joey and Vickie La Motta. Both performances are good but Joe Pesci is amazing as Joey the brother to boxer Jake La Motta. Joey and Jake whenever they're on screen together it's very interesting to watch. The way the two actors talk is like they're actually brothers, whether they're bickering or just talking it always feels natural. The movie's script is one of it's many high points. It's very well written that flows great despite needing to cover so many years of events. The movie's soundtrack is also a high point. A great thing that this movie was able to do was the ability to convey many emotions, the tension in the ring, the depressing aspect later in La Motta's life, and a (what I find) heartwarming scene when the audience is shown home movies of Jake La Motta, his wife and kids. The movie remains interesting because your able to witness the violent depressing life of a violent depressing man. Your able to see what to most would be something minor as a big deal in his world (for example when his wife says hi to other men at a restaurant). The boxing scenes are a highlight in the movie, most people may say there unrealistic but I don't care about it's realism, the fights are visually something great, very bloody and brutal also. In the final 15 minutes of the film you see Jake's life once he's retired boxing. Robert De Niro actually gained 60 pounds for those parts of the movie. But those final 15 minutes are actually quite sad, your able to see that his relationships have all fallen apart, his wife divorced him, has custody of his kids, and his brother wants no part of him. But yet he is at peace with himself as the biblical quote at the end explains. ",

It is a brutally charged bio regarding inner rage and personal destruction. True story of boxer Jake La Motta who struggled to obtain a championship title shot. He expresses himself through anger, rage and brute force. His brother and manager knows his anger all too well as well as his second wife whom he met when she was only fifteen. The film displays many forms of anger and violence but none are as frequent than his inability to trust. Among the best boxing footage ever filmed director Martin Scorsese uses black and white to capture the mood. Robert De Niro delivers a powerful performance as a man made a victim to his own distrust. He spent time in prison after his career faded, then he attempted standup comedy. Cathy Moriarty plays his wife who becomes the object of possession. His anger ultimately drives her away after one flash of violence too many. Joe Pesci as his brother becomes the channel for abuse but sees his brother better than anybody. Theresa Saldana appears as Pesci's wife whom he mistreats but she plays off knowing her place. Frank Vincent is also cast as someone connected to the mafia who watches the fights. Masterpiece portrait of a boxing legend who fell in the bout against his own rage. Score: 10 / 10",
153,6 August 1999,V Hanna,10, Best Fight Scenes Hands Down!!,"There are movies that try to be works of art and then every once in a while there are movies that are art. This movie proves that films are just as important as something hanging on the wall. Scorsese brilliantly captures the life of boxer Jake LaMotta like few people that have been brought to life on screen. Robert DeNiro gives one of the best performances in film history. He plays LaMotta like a concert violinist in front of a sold out audience. DeNiro combined with Joe Pesci as LaMotta's younger brother and trainer Joey are a perfect combination. The cinematography just rips you to shreds and leaves you gasping for air. I never have seen a movie display raw emotion better than Raging Bull. After viewing this movie more than ten times the scenes inside the ring stand out more and more. They make Rocky's fight scenes look like your watching a cartoon. If you watch closely you can truly experience what the fighters are going through. The speed of the jabs, the pounding each fighter takes, the animalistic emotion that they draw upon. Scorsese  includes so many jarring sound and visual effects in the fight scenes that make it so real you can smell the damn thing. And the blood. If this thing was ever colorized it might be the bloodiest movie ever. But it is not over used and misrepresented. It is needed to displayed the true violence that can exist in a boxing ring. Raging Bull is more than just about boxing. It covers spousal jealousy and abuse and it also shows the breakdown that they can cause in a person leading to self destruction. There are so many great shots that it almost becomes ridiculous. One of the best is the one with DeNiro on the ropes in a Christ like image with Sugar Ray Robinson just starring him down ready to crucify DeNiro with his fists. Unbelievable scene. Cathy Moriarty does a great job as LaMotta's wife Vicky and young Frank Vincent has the role as Salvy. Vincent and Pesci really go at it in one scene that leads to a funny shot when they are asked by the local mob boss to make up and be friends. Vincent would go on to be a main stay in most of Scorsese's movies. This movie displays so vividly how LaMotta's violent insides leaked over into his personal life and lead to his destruction. DeNiro rightfully deserved the Academy Award for this role. This is the first time he is asked to gain a large amount of weight as he also did in the 'Untouchables'. And, from reading interviews on how he gains the weight it doesn't sound as easy as you think for someone not used to being in that condition. When an actor is willing to give that much to a role (sorry Stallone you are a little late on this one but I appreciate the effort) you know you have something special. If you haven't seen Raging Bull watch it. You will quickly realize why this was voted the best movie of the eighties.",

So, enough has been said for me to make even the most cynical people out there believe me that the acting in this is absolutely top quality. The directing is incredible. The stylish black and white makes this stand out among other movies and really gives some strong ground as to when this story was set.

161,21 May 2019,YeppityYepYepYeat,10, Fantastic Character Study,"Raging Bull is a film that works on nearly every level. Martin Scorsese's direction perfectly captures the time period of the film as well as the emotional and physical intensity of Jake LaMotta's story. The screenplay by Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin is gritty but honest and beautiful. These elements combined with the phenomenal (and believable) performances of Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and the rest of the amazing cast make Raging Bull a must-see. This could have been a by-the-numbers, generic sports movie, but Scorsese and the writers instead crafted a complex portrait of a deeply troubled man. At certain points in the film, LaMotta seems despicable and completely unlikeable but at other points is sweet and charming. He is portrayed as a real human being and not just a caricature. The boxing matches are brutal and intense, but the more intimate scenes are emotionally draining as well. This is largely due to Scorsese's stylistic choices, such as the edgy black and white color palate and the home video-style transition sequences. Everything in this film is intentional and aids the story; no time is waisted. By analyzing Jake LaMotta throughout not only his boxing career but later on in his life as well, Raging Bull becomes a fascinating, intelligent, and emotional character study more than it is a straight up boxing movie. It takes a while to get into and drags in a few places. Also, some of the supporting performances are spotty and some characters are underdeveloped.

162,22 December 2009,Ziya90,6," As a drama, it is very good, but as a sport movie, it fails","Raging Bull is a real stylish drama and it has Robert De Niro, but it looks like Martin Scorsese's gangster movies rather than a sport, boxing movie. This is why it was a big disappointment to me. Therefore, the hype (the greatest boxing film ever made, much better than Rocky series) is just a hype, not true. This is not a sport movie and I know that Martin Scorsese said that he hates sport movies, so he passes over boxing scenes quickly (the boxing scenes are too short) thus there is not enough material on boxing in the movie. Scorsese cannot create his own boxing movie, instead he does what he wants to do, he does what he is good at, a crime drama (that also recalls his other gangster movies as said) Therefore, Raging Bull is not the story of a boxer, instead it is like the story of a mafia boss who has some troubles while trying to rise. I think that there is a polarization among people. According to the first group, Rocky series are unrivaled, especially the first one is great, according to the other group, Rocky is nothing in comparison with Raging Bull, it is better by far as a sport film. Raging Bull is a very good drama, but it fails as a sport movie. By the way, personally I prefer Rocky (especially the first movie, the third movie and the fourth movie) A critic says that Rocky is a thickheaded boxer who does not add anything to the movie, he just fights. He does not have to be smart and when it comes to Raging Bull, they say boxing scenes were great, especially camera usage and editing. No, this is not true, a hype! And by the way, according to some, Raging Bull is Rocky of intellectual people. I don't know why I feel like this, but it seems that yes it is. Scorsese's direction, carefully planned great black and white cinematography and Robert De Niro with one of the most realistic make up makes Raging Bull a must see, but as a sport film it is very disappointing. As for the boxing scenes, if you look for great boxing scenes (except for Rocky), I recommend you the opening scene of John Woo's Broken Arrow.",

However having said that it is a true classic, it is one of the best movies ever made, i'm sure back then it was exciting as hell, however i didn't find it that exciting.There are a LOT of powerful scenes, and some of them were quite shocking and the last 30 to 40 minutes are awesome, plus the boxing matches are great!. I actually liked the use of black and white, and i must say this once again Deniro is phenomenal!, The Direction is brilliant!. Martin Scorsese, does a brilliant job here, nothing fancy, but as always Sscorse's direction is always perfect(except for the pace at times_ here is no different, he is one of the best directors of all time!. Robert De Niro gives one of the best performances ever in a movie,and is AMAZING as always, and unquestionably deserved his Oscar, he played a bit of a jerk though, and i found it hard to like him, however his performance is incredible, and his portrayal as Jake Lamotta is perfect!(Deniro Rules!). Cathy Moriarty, is excellent here, she is beautiful likable ,as Deniro's wife and i felt sorry for her. Joe Pesci is fantastic here, and plays a character similar to Goodfellas and Casino, and it was awesome!. Frank Vincent is great with what he has to do. Overall Not my favorite boxing movie and a bit overrated however it is one of the best films ever made, and deserves it's reputation of being a true classic a Must see this instant!. ***** out of 5 definitely",

Martin Scorsese's usually over reaching vision delivered an experience that is as vulgar as it is complete. The black and white approach, the slow motion and extraordinary editing techniques, vintage soundtrack and sound effects, the clever lighting and smoke, and the changing of the ring sizes all make this a cine-phile experience to study, appreciate and enjoy. A boxing story? Yes...but a genius approach to it! Robert DiNero as The Bull is one scary portrayal, and one that deserves watching unto itself. There is a very real aspect of this movie that is actually unappealing yet enhancing the reality and further drawing one into this simple, black and white existence.",

To start things off Robert De Niro does a superb job and was amazing in the film, Joe Pesci is fantastic in this film too and so did Cathy Moriarty. Jake LaMotta is a complex character, he has a lot of flaws and the movie does not shy away from that. He takes things the wrong way almost all of the time and he gets angry a lot because of it hence the title. Unlike Rocky this is not really a movie about inspiring someone, this movie is a look behind the curtain on a boxer who has a lot of problems. The little things like the the title in the beginning being red symbolizing rage and anger don't get enough credit. The scenes where Jake is slapping Vicky because he took something that happened the wrong way or when Joey was reaching his breaking point because he is getting sick of Jake are my favorite scenes in the movie because it shows a good look into reality and are emotional. He may have been a prizefighter in the ring but in real life he is not. The movie presents it's real fights outside the ring, the fights that break Jake down as a person and that's what I love about this movie. And when I think back at this movie I don't think about the boxing I think about everything outside of it but that's not to say the boxing in this movie is good because it sure is, boxing is just a way to release is anger and it is not really a central part of the movie.

Starring Robert De Niro, ""Raging Bull"" is not a boxing movie in the vein of ""Rocky"".  There is plenty of boxing in it, some of the best boxing scenes ever put onto celluloid, and the movie does follow his rise as a professional boxer.  However, all of that is a backdrop for Jake's real story, his fall as a human being. The closer Jake gets to his goal of winning the Middleweight Championship, the closer he is to destroying his own life.  And once he achieves his goal, all of the energy and passion that went into fighting in the ring he turns to fighting out of the ring and he does just that, destroys his life.

DeNiro is great, Pesci is great and the movie therefore is great. DeNiro got an Oscar and Pesci should have got an Oscar. I would say the most fascinating thing about Jake LaMotta besides the fact he was one of the greatest boxers of all time is that he was friends with and personally knew several members of Nino Gaggi's uncontrollable DeMeo Street Crew of the Gambino Crime Family featured in the best selling book Murder Machine by Jerry Capeci and Gene Mustain.

In a heart stopping scene where Jake (played by De Niro slapped his wife all over the place, Martin Scorsese made me feel that I'm useless, that I could only watch and feel ashamed. Other acts of violence in the film set the entire mood of the film. Anger floats around the whole film and the audience, the unwilling victim. In the end there's a bit of retribution and forgiveness, but it is not clear who would benefit from it. It is a great study of a man's connection with his dark side. Why can't he just walk away from it? Is it a personal choice, or is it really hard to fight it off? One will be transfixed not only by the chaotic scenes and strong dialogue, but also by the most unconventional protagonist I've seen so far in movies released in the 80's: Jake LaMotta.

As the back of the box tells you, it's this anger that leads to Jake LaMotta's professional success and private ruin.

So let me start by saying the cast are all great I think the two best though are De Niro and Pesci, it is worth mentioning that De Niros performance I saw one magazine rank the 11th greatest off all time, the film is a film about boxing but I feel it is so much more then that it is really about jealousy and it shows it in a way that is way ahead of any other film that has jealousy in. The Boxing scenes are far better shot then any other film it just looks wonderful, I like Rocky but this is the champion of all boxing movies in fact even though I don't like to call it a sport movie if you do call it that it is the best sports movie ever. a lot more great things could be said about this film or you could just watch it and see how great it is yourself and watch it more then once it gets better the more you watch it.

The women he meets is the only thing in his life that brings him happiness ( notice in the montage sequence with the music playing the shots through the home video recorder of his family and wife are the only scenes in color which are disturbed with pictures of his fights in black in white witch represent his character clashing with family). Also, the film is about how the choices you make as a young person can drastically effect the rest of your life. Robert De Niro's performance is the most painfully realistc piece of acting I have ever seen. Martin Sorsesse's directing is also the finest in the history of cinema. Also, Thelma Schoobaker's film editing is the most meticulouse and brilliant ever. Joe Pesci, for the first time gives a fully rounded performance as Jake La Matta's younger brother. This film has a lot of heart and has more about life in it than any other.

Plus the master Martin Scorsese does a fine job with the directing as his theme of character study and development into downfall is perfectly done. Robert DeNiro gives a tough and fired up performance as former real life and ex boxer middleweight Jake LaMotta, the film showcases Jake's life and career from the early 1940's till his washed up downfall as a low rent club owning stand up comedian in the early 1960's. The scenes are memorable not just the boxing ones but, the scenes of rage and blow ups from the LaMotta character and the viewer can see just how the impact and scandal of the mob impacted boxing in the early days. Joe Pesci gives a strong performance as LaMotta's brother Joey he always gives encouragement and advice in an aggressive and upbeat manner, really one of the better supporting roles I've seen done in film nice work Mr. Pesci. This film really is a great character study of rage, anger, and obsession just wanting to make your dream happen, but it proves many times that a downfall in the end happens it can be sad and tragic.

Honestly, people nowadays need to see this movie because it has an important underlying message about toxic masculinity and being too focused on fame. The fight scenes were excessive, and could have used some restraint.

We're talking about a film that numerous critics have named the best of the 1980s. Now the 80s were a pretty weak time for film, and RAGING BULL is a beautiful motion picture, but the very best? It's up there with FULL METAL JACKET, MILLER'S CROSSING, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, THE SHINING, FERRIS BUELLER, DAS BOOT, etc, as a great 80s movie, but I've never been convinced that this film lives up to the hype. I dare say that Scorsese's own TAXI DRIVER and GOODFELLAS are even more impressive. But I'm harping too much on reputation and expectation.

And he consistently churns out one solid movie after another, with even his lesser works [(Gangs of New York (2002), Shutter Island (2010)] standing out above almost everything else that comes out in terms of quality. While his movies are consistently solid even if not always perfect, more than a few have stood out as timeless, essential classics that will forever go down in film history. Goodfellas (1990) and Taxi Driver (1976) are widely noted as being arguably the greatest films of their respective decades. His greatest masterpiece, Raging Bull (1984), follows in this tradition.

And lastly the dedication. There is no Robert DeNiro in this movie, he's 100% Jake LaMotta. A well earned Oscar.

231,15 February 2020,dannyrovira-38154,10, SCORSESE'S MAGNUM OPUS AND DE NIRO'S GREATEST PERFORMANCE,"Martin Scorsese's supreme artistic masterwork is an extraordinarily compelling motion picture of enormous power and rare distinction. A searing biography of middleweight boxing champion Jake La Motta, his rise to glory in the 1940s, his personal battles due to numerous inner demons, and his fall as an obese lounge lizard parody of his former self in the 1950s. Robert De Niro delivers a titanic portrayal that is one of the most astonishing performances ever recorded on film. He completely immersed himself in the ultimate method-acting tour-de-force as a young, lean, muscular Jake LaMotta. He rigorously trained with the real LaMotta mastering his crouched-in close style of boxing to become a completely convincing fighter, then he gain 60 pounds to play the bloated boxer in his later years. I was not surprised when De Niro won his well-deserved Oscar for Best Actor for this legendary performance. The brutal, visceral, no-holds-barred, highly stylized boxing sequences are some the best ever filmed. Showing the devastating blows hitting the bodies of the fighters and blood spraying out of their faces, it captures the intensity of the bouts with considerable force. The unforgettable climactic fight between LaMotta and Sugar Ray Robinson is one of the bloodiest and most gut-wrenching fight scenes ever made. Michael Chapman's stunning black & white cinematography is magnificent. The lighting of the film was made hash and stark to provide an expressionistic look and feel to the savage violence in the ring. Impeccable supporting performances by Joe Pesci, Cathy Moriarty, Nicholas Colasanto, and Frank Vincent. But it's De Niro's larger-than-life performance that owns this classic film. Scorsese's masterful direction is exhilarating, editor Thelma Schoonmaker won a Oscar for her dazzling work, and the period recreation is flawless. This film connects on primal themes with a brilliant Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader script which is rooted in contrary pulls of ambition, lust and redemption. ""Raging Bull"" has been crowned with so many critical laurels and awards that another word of praise seems hopelessly redundant, let's just say that it puts to shame virtually any American film made since then. Required viewing for anyone who truly loves the cinematic arts.

Scorsese's adaptation of La Motta's rollercoaster of a life shows a mans capacity to self destruct when he has no control over his anger and selfishness, leading him to lose the people he loves and relies on. La Motta's fights in the ring symbolize the fights he's facing in his own mind everyday. The ring is his judgement and showcases his true feeling, sometimes showing pure ferocity and aggression to his opponent and beating him until he is unrecognizable, and other times being on the ropes being the one taking the beating, but never letting himself go down, showing his stubbornness and disregard for his actions. De Niro's tour de force performance as the troubled man is by far his greatest, and Scorsese's incredible storytelling is at its best here.

Because of Scorsese's fatal drug addiction, he didn't expect much more and he didn't expect to get back on track. While making Raging Bull while he suffered from the addictions, he was more than on track and he was more than on top of the game. Scorsese put on a master work as he skillfully developed enough will and strength to make Raging Bull, in the top 100 here at IMDb. This is a crown jewel, which really reminds me of Scarface (mainly because of the swearing) however, this was more meaningful than Scarface. You can't have everything when you're worried about everything. Raging Bull teaches us how easily we fall into the snares we originally set up for ourselves and how easily we fall prey to our own disasters. Scorsese has put on a lot of great films over the years and I'm looking for many more to follow from his directing. Raging Bull, I would have to say, was his best film yet if you take into account all the factors. Keep in mind, Scorsese was in a different mindset. Everyone is when thy're on drugs and I'm sure he couldn't function as well as someone he wasn't on drugs but we saw perfection from Raging Bull. We see Scorsese was also determined to prove something, to overcome the insurmountable odds that were stacked against him. However, people function better when backed into the corner. Regardless, this is still a great film, whether it be Scorsese's greatest of all time or not and we can still appreciate it regardless of how it was directed and made on.",

Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the uncommercial appeal of its subject matter (how can we sympathize with such an unlikable man?) and that at the box office 1980 was owned by The Empire Strikes Back, Raging Bull flopped but its creators still deservedly received vast critical acclaim. This was what saved it from going under, and fortunately it has now become a must-see classic.",

But I'm reading and have nearly finished the book Raging Bull and it makes the movie recede in my mind. Don't get me wrong, Scorcese put it together quite nicely, and of course Deniro is intense. The book is better because of the way Lamotta described the fight scenes; the sweat, the noise, the feeling of winning the middle weight championship, and the feeling of going crazy was out standing. I think Scorsese is a visionnary because he shows the cruel world of boxing and what it does to a man and his pride. Plus the chemistry between Pesci and Deniro was electrifying. It is Deniro's best movie and he deserved his Oscar.",

De Niro is absolutely brilliant in a brutal, tormented, jealous angry husband who makes his wife's life impossible. This is exactly what should be brought up to Stallone's face every time to remind him that it is wrong to not care about the point of directing good movies, and it's a shame this movie rarely gets talked about when it comes to De Niro's career. Mostly now all you hear is the Godfather (more like godly boring) and Heat, which aren't very good movies. But Raging Bull even if Scorcese doesn't convince you with his picture, cinematography and filming, provides some really good actors. Everyone acts well, and you see the progression that sounds natural, Jake drives them all nuts and his destiny can only be a major downfall.

It is a brutal story. Since we are never given any insights into his early life we don't know how he got yo such a place. He is a goon, but there a moments when you cannot help but feel sorry for him,especially after he takes a dive for a fighter of a lesser stature than himself, and then subsequently loses his boxing licence for a period of time. We feel his grief at haven taken this deal. Robert DeNiro does a brilliant job creating this character. We sympathize with his wife, played by Cathy Moriarty, as she absorbs a lot of his anger and frustration. But it is Joe Pesci as his long suffering brother stands out as being the voice of reason throughout the film, weathering his brother's wild fluctuations in behaviour.

Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty give notable performances as Joey an Vickie La Motta, Jake's brother and wife. La Motta's is a story of a man who was a champion at one time, but fell into a self-destructive state, a broken man and a failure.

As a boxer he was virtually unstoppable with his rage, violence, and eventually self-destruction.

Jake LaMotta is a man with zero interesting traits as a human being. I don't want to see his life; I don't care at all.

265,16 March 2008,johno1100,10, Gritty yet still maintains beautiful artistic illustration (Like most of Scorsese's movies in that period),"The partnership between revolutionary director Martin Scorsese and iconic actor Robert De Niro which spanned for about 20/25 years will forever be remembered by critics and fans as one of the greatest periods for cinematic achievement. A time were both of these legends peaked in their careers. Of course there were other actors involved (Joe Pesci, Frank Vincent, etc) But the two constants of these movies were Scorsese and De Niro. They are credited with making some of the greatest movies of all time IE; Taxi driver, Raging bull, Goodfellas and Casino just to name a few. These movies have received marvellous critical acclaim and continue to be loved even after 30 after some of them were made. They gave us a look at a world most of us had never seen, the underworld of society. They made us feel for characters we wouldn't usually associate with. And they set a standard for their type of movie which hasn't yet been conquered. But as much as I could talk all day about how these two geniuses revolutionised cinema the main concentration of this review will be based on the 1980 movie raging bull. To an outsider given only a vague idea to the story of Raging bull it is just another boxing movie. But if we look deeper into the surface we find that it is much more. It is more than just another rocky movie, it's not about a brain dead boxer who tries hard and wins it has much more deaph than that. The movie tells the story of an emotionally self destructive boxers rise (ish) And fall. It is a study of a man (Jake La Motta played by De Niro) who keeps knocking himself down everywhere he goes in life. A man who we learn more and more about throughout the course of the movie. We see he abuses the women in his life he sees them as slaves not human beings. We see throughout the course of the movie that he ends up despising himself. We see that he will be willing to change himself just for the sake of masculinity something which most men can relate to. The boxing ring is nothing more than a symbolic parallel to his life outside it. it's almost as if he is punishing himself for what he has done in his life. La Motta ends up in a state were he doesn't demand pity but the audience feels sorry for him anyway. Although La Motta is a scumbag we are still interested and relating with the character throughout the 2 hour long movie. Scorsese makes Raging bull a lot more classical with the use of classical music throughout the films gritty tale it gives us a feel of beauty beneath the surface of this man tough guy exterior.",

267,20 March 2006,johno-21,10, Brutality as art - Art ain't always pretty,"Robert De Niro pitched the idea of this film based on the book by Jake La Motta and Joseph Carter to director Martin Scorsesse in 1974. It's the biography of Middlewieght boxer Jake La Motta and his climb and fall from fight fame spanning the years 1941-1964. De Niro put on 60 pounds in his transformation of the younger to older La Motta. This film is shot entirely in black and white by cinematographer Michael Chapman who was nominated for and should have won the Academy Award for Cinematography for 1980. From 1939 through 1966 the cinematography category was split into two awards, one for color and one for black and white. From 1967 until present the two categories were reduced to just one regardless of a film in color or black and white. Raging Bull would be the last black and white film to be nominated for Best Cinematography until 2005 when Good Night and Good Luck, shot in black and white received a nomination. Chapman had worked with Scorsesse on Taxi Driver and The Last Waltz. Di Nero won his second career Oscar and his fourth nomination in his portrayal as the self destructive demon battling and brutal Jake La Motta who in the ring masters his rage into an art form. In the supporting cast Cathy Morriarty received her only career nomination as Best Supporting Actress in her role as Vickie La Motta and Joe Pesci as Jake's brother Joey received his first career nomination as Best Supporting Actor. Also in the principal cast are Frank Vincent, Theresa Saldana and Nicholas Colasanto. The film's second Oscar win went to Theresa Schoonmaker who previously had been nominated for her editing of Woodstock. This film was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Sound. Raging Bull marked Di Nero's fourth film with Scorsesse following Taxi Driver, Mean Streets and New York, New York. This film has a great script, a wonderful cast from top to bottom, amazing cinematography, sound and editing and a fantastic production design. Some call this Scorsesse's masterpiece but it certainly is Di Nero's masterpiece in acting. I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it several times since.

In 1941, however, when Raging Bull takes place, it seems to have been a much bigger brand, at least that's the impression I get when seeing it as a major sponsor at major sporting events.

This film is a portrayal of a boxer and his failing relationship with his wife and his determination to succeed. The starkness of the contrast of the black and white picture makes the film seem harder, and the camera shots and angles of the fight are captured perfectly and flawlessly. This is heightened even more with the stark contrast in colour and helps show the darkness of the blood. There are also good performances by the actors and actresses, and the story is an interesting one where one can feel for the characters. This is iconic and brilliantly created, and I recommend this film to anyone, even if boxing is not really something you enjoy. Do not give this one a miss.",

He is authentically disturbing, entirely becoming this awful man, transcending the universe. He does not play anything he does on screen. He is everything he does on screen. He lives and breathes his performance, and you realize that his portrayal runs so deep that it's no longer a performance in the traditional sense. It is haunting in a way that you must see to believe. I have never seen anything like it.

279,11 February 2004,marke8603,10, Excellent film-making in every aspect,"I went into this movie, having heard good things about it but not knowing what would entail, thinking I was going to watch a Rocky film with perhaps a little more class. When it ended, I sat through the credits, just thinking, almost scarred by LaMotta's life. It was a journey, pure and simple. There was no climactic ending, but the fist thrusts at the end hurt me, and pretty much summarised the film itself. He just couldn't escape the rage and passion of the ring. I became so attatched to the character, and related to his every characteristic. A ""real life"" character played to the best possible effect by DeNiro. The directing and editing, too, keeps the story moving fluently and with a unique style, some effects in the ring actually reflecting the mood and atmosphere of a real fight perfectly. The Black and whiteness is indeed a brave step taken by, in my opinion, a brave and most worthy director. It emphasises the gritty, dry, and realistic approach to the lives of these brilliantly acted characters. The fight scenes could have been coreographed more realistically, but hey, this is film world. A few characters fade, leaving empty spaces to be filled, but the film moves on swiftly. Some may argue that the film could have been a bit shorter, but every minute worth of plot in there is vital to the overall impression of our main character. Everything collapses in the man's life, and we go from scene to scene feeling loss after loss after such emphatic highs. Great emotional impact helped by wonderfully emotional acting. I can identify with the realism of the character after the recent evidence of Frank Bruno's downfall, leading him into a mental hospital. It's the love of the game and the thrill of the fight that drive these characters out of moral society. Anyway, enough, this film strikes all the right chords, and rightly should be acclaimed as one of the top few films of the 80s for it's originality and character development.",

281,23 June 2020,timmyminh,9, Before Wolf of Wall Street there was Raging Bull,"Don't go into this thinking it's a boxing film, but rather about a man who was a boxer. Scorsese's cinematic biopics, namely The Aviator, Wolf of Wall Street, and this one are so unique because of exactly that. Most biopics are made about big figures such as a singer or a famous historical character and they made a film about the life of those figures. However, Scorsese doesn't go that route, it's as if he carefully chooses and studies a figure with an interesting character and wants to take a cinematic portrayal of that famous person's psychology and bring it to light on the big screen. The screenwriter Paul Schrader (who was also the screenwriter for Taxi Driver) wrote this film with the intention of not focusing too much on fight strategy and boxing, because as we see, the film is a character study of Jake LaMotta. It shows a man who is paralyzed by sexual insecurity, envy, and rage and his fights in the ring are curiously not motivated by tactics or even a desire to triumph but by his fear and rage. I have to admit, I did expect a boxing flick going into this picture but I got something even better.",

This movie assured Scorsese the status of being one of the single most important American artists in the history of cinema. This film is heavily influenced by the French Nouvelle Vague. Some cuts and shots are lifted from Truffaut's 'Jules et Jim' and Godard's 'A Bout de Souffle'. But Scorsese's own highly authentic voice assures the audience of a very unique viewing experience. It's almost unmeasurable how many filmmakers were directly influence by this film and his other work. I remember meeting Scorsese in Knokke-Le-Zoute in '68 when he won the Festival Award for his short 'The Big Shave'. He said half-jokingly that his filmwork would only ever be fully appreciated in Europe because he is so inspired by the European directors of the fifties and the sixties and shares their sensibilities. Unfortunately this predicament has been true. Martin Scorsese has been denied an Oscar his entire career but has won, since Knokke-Le-Zoute, every major award in Europe. The Academy should better hurry up and make up for their mistake! Give Marty that statue. And then give him another one! He's the best you've got!!",

Of course like usual Robert DeNiro puts up an excellent performance and Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci also do a fine job. The fights in the ring were awesome. I like how Jake LaMotta gets a few punches and it looks like he was never even hit. What a great boxer! The dialouge was good and the black and white picture was very neatly picked out. The only negative I have for this film is that it got slow at times and kind of got a tiny bit boring but then it got back up to it's hype again and I still enjoyed it. Highly recommend it.,

Shot as a type of coming-of-age thrill as it opens with the future and dissolves into chronological flashbacks. We see the rise and fall of a superstar. Someone sailing on the tight ropes of fame only to let classically let it all go to his mind and body. He is cocky because of what he is. With each battle he grows less human. He's stronger physically, but emotionally, he's lost his sense of sight. Lost all ties to reality and more possessive as the days pass. As he gets a big head through his talents, he grows confident starting courting 15-year-old Viki Thailer (Cathy Moriarity). It starts out well, but it certainly turns sinister as Viki tries to talk to other people. He gets a paranoid persona and develops a rage in him. He starts questioning everything around him and doesn't trust anyone. The beginning of rage starts in the scene where Jake and his brother Joey La Motta (Joe Pesci) were in the middle of an argument at the kitchen table with their wives and baby present. The brothers told their wives to leave and take their children with them. As a form of dominance, Jake changes his attitude from than on.",

Beautiful and haunting cinematography (Seriously one of the best uses of lighting that too being a black and white movie), wonderful script(That Joe Pesci's line, Who came up with that!!!)and to top it all De Niro's best performance. Scorcese is brilliant as always.
This is just one of those perfect movies ever made. Every tiny detail contributes to the story. And the boxing matches. Oh my the boxing matches. Shot so well. Yeah it might not be as ""cool"" as Rocky or other famous boxing movies because Raging Bull isn't interested in the fight but is rather interested in the character that is Jake LaMotta and the use of the Ring as some sort of a confessing room. The Flashes of light and the presence of Sugar Ray and the camera angles(slightly elevated toward Sugar ray and downwards toward Jake in that famous zoom in shot) just elevate the fight to some sort of a n unreal and heavenly matchup.
This movie is basically about the anger and monstrosity inside Jake which lets him win matches in the ring but ruins his life outside of it. On how His paranoia and sexual jealousy on his wife(Cathy Moriarty in a wonderful turn as Vickie) leads him to his self destruction.In his view there are just two kind of girls. Pure Virgins or pathetic sluts. That's why he never even has sex with her so that he doesn't make her impure. He is a sociopath who doesn't even understand sarcasm and is almost like an animal that is, he cannot make his own decisions and if he does it is mostly an act of violence. And worst of all, he doesn't even realize he is a bad man and he thinks he deserves an excuse for all the pathetic things he has done. He thinks his brother should have taken care of him more and recites Brando's speech from On the Waterfront and blames his brother for his failure while practising himself in-front of the mirror(subtle reflection on how he is just telling it to himself). He pushes away everyone who cared for him and in the end he blames them for leaving him. Oh my I can go on forever while writing about Raging Bull.

Hugo and Taxi Driver are a bit too slow, Shutter Island and The Wolf of Wall Street go on a little bit and Goodfellas is a bit meandering, although all of those movies are very fine. Raging Bull is the one where nearly everything is perfect; a devastating, rage fuelled, borderline harrowing meditation on masculinity, inner demons and jealousy. It may look like a film about boxing, but it's really a character study showing Jake La Motta's battling his inner demons in the ring instead of his opponents. Although, it should be noted the fight scenes might be the greatest combat scenes I've ever seen in a film. Shot in black and white, Scorsese edits and directs RB to haunting perfection.

The story was choppy and hard to follow. And just when you thought the movie should end, it kept dragging on and on and had no defining climax or resolution. Then all of a sudden it just stopped. Very poor film-making in my opinion, and not worthy of any awards. This film was basically plot less. It would be as if you took two arbitrary points in my life and chose to make a movie about the time in between. There's no plot, it builds up to nothing, there is no climax, no final resolution, nothing at all to indicate that the end is coming. The movie just starts, and then it stops later.

With it's amazing screenplay by Schrader, Scorsese's direction and the relationship between De niro and Joe Pesci made for a cinematic masterpiece despite the contempt the audience has for la motta and poor box office sales when released in 1980. This film will be remembered for the scenes between Jake la motta and his brother which let us delve into the mind of a emotionally self destructive man. As for regards acting this film will be remembered for the transformation of De niro, with his belief in method acting and earing the right to play a character, transformed himself to the physicality of a real middle weight boxer enabling him to fight in actual boxing matches. De niro, then adds on 60 pounds to play Jake la motta later in life. Due to the transformations, this earned De niro the best actor award and confirmed him as one of the greatest actors of all time.

Also worth noting is the amazing black and white cinematography of Michael Chapman. Although I don't really say this about movies, but I am in awe of how certain scenes are set up (Like when Pesci and his family are eating dinner and LaMotta comes charging into his place. You can literally see Lamotta entering from a mile away). Fun fun fun! What more do you want from a movie?",

308,19 April 2020,alexismaria02,10, A once in a lifetime experience,"What is there left to say about Raging Bull? It is one of the most astonishing films ever to be made and that is mostly because of Robert De Niro's uniqueness. There is nobody like him. He just makes you sit in front of the screen and not move for about 2 hours, because that's how much he can captivate us in each film he makes. Each scene was so pure and (almost) flawless. But, there is another reason, which brings this film to its greatness and that is the one and only, Martin Scorsese. I feel like this is one of his best work and if not, one of the greatest movies ever to be made.
You might think at first that this is a typical boxing movie, but it ain't nothing like that. The De Niro- Scorsese duo made sure of that. They put their hearts in this particular film, because that's what they do. They make you live with the characters they build and once they do that, there is no turning back. You simply fall in love with their work.
Also, the fact that this film is in black&white simply takes the film to a whole new other level. It is beyond beautiful and mesmerizing to watch.
This is also a film that teaches you a lot and that comes as a bonus. I totally recommend it, because it is truly a once in a lifetime experience!",

This also leaves out the fact that Robert DeNiro gains a ton of weight for his role as La Motta. Robert DeNiro's performance as Jake La Motta is possibly the best performance in motion picture history.

The storyline follows an Italian boxer who is always pushing for the title to become the lightweight heavyweight champion of the world and eventually gets it. While married he finds a younger woman he becomes obsessed with. He gets divorced, remarries his obsession, and the obsession never stops...and neither does his insecurities. His insecurities may lead to his downfall and never living up to his potential. This movie is directed by icon Martin Scorsese (Casino) and stars Robert De Niro (Cape Fear), Joe Pesci (My Cousin Vinny), Cathy Moriarty (Analyze That), Frank Vincent (Goodfellas) and Charles Scorsese (The King of Comedy). The storyline for this movie is absolutely outstanding, one of the best character pieces you will ever see. This is easily my favorite all time De Niro performance and is probably my favorite Scorsese picture (and that's saying something). Every single character is perfectly executed and depicted from beginning to end. Some of the content is tough to stomach, but still absolutely polarizing. The power and influences of insecurities is so brilliant displayed. The cinematography in this movie, especially the fight scenes, likely makes this the best boxing picture all time.

In that time, La Motta bounces around from one mediocre boxing match to the next. He likes to yell a lot. Years zip by without meaning. He worries about getting fat. He meets Cathy Moriarty. I kept asking myself what was supposed to be so ""terrific"" about this picture, and why wasn't anything interesting occurring? But I finally (and I do mean ""finally"") began to become somewhat sucked in somewhere around the 75-90 minute mark, and then what I witnessed was good, solid drama. Robert De Niro was exceptional and Joe Pesci was well cast as his brother. Some good acting and a real feel for the era of the '40s and '50s. Not a ""great film"" in my estimation by any means, and quite overrated when considered by the majority to be such ... but a ""pretty good"" one by the time the last bell was rung. **1/2 out of ****",
326,25 September 2020,TheHonestCritic,2," Well..... This is a ""film"" that definitely lives up to it's title. It's nothing but a load of bull!","""Raging Bull"" (1980), this ""movie"" is nothing but a rip-off of the ""Rocky"" films. Now, I understand that there are movies out there that follow the same formats in genres. There are other sports films, including boxing films, that I do enjoy. Unfortunately, ""Raging Bull"" is a cheap ""Rocky"" knockoff. Why do people like this ""movie""? This ""film"" has an uninspired and boring story, terrible acting, boring sets/locations and a generic predictable soundtrack. The story, or some sort of resemblance of, is about an aspiring boxer that's struggling with his career and his personal life. Hmmm, I wonder where I saw that before? Oh yeah, the ""Rocky"" films! Aside from the bad cliched underdog story in ""Raging Bull"", this ""film"" is seasoned with predictable scenes, boring dialogue and more! Another stupid thing that they did with this ""movie"" is that they converted it to black and white. Keep in mind, there are a lot of black and white movies and TV shows that I enjoy, but making this ""film"" black and white adds nothing to it. If anything, it just makes it all the more dull and unappealing. That's a good word to describe this ""film"", unappealing! There are some other words I'd prefer to use, but I'm trying to keep my reviews PG rated. I wonder if this ""movie"" would be somewhat better in color? Maybe so, but not by much though. Now for the acting in this ""film"", it's a total joke. All of the actors and actresses give terrible performances. However, the only ones that seem to be putting forth some effort are Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci. I'm starting to get the idea that Martin Scorsese tries to milk as much out of the same actors as he possibly can. That's one of the biggest problems with Martin Scorsese, he's afraid to step out of his comfort zone and try something else. In the film industry, you must not be afraid to take risks. When you take big risks, you get big rewards. All of the sets/locations are dull and give the ""film"" a boring atmosphere. The black and white format just accentuated the boredom as far as the sets/locations are concerned. Finally, the soundtrack is simply generic and predictable, yet not memorable. Bad movies equal bad film soundtracks! The only good thing I can salvage out of this ""film"" is the special effects. Now, there aren't that many of them, but what little there are do work and they still hold up today. Remember, good special effects are no excuse for a horrible movie! ""Raging Bull"" is nothing but a jumbled mess. This ""movie"" was so bad that I almost screamed! Overall, I give this ""film"" a 1 out of 5 star rating which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. I'm starting to consider Martin Scorsese an overrated hack in the film industry. He hardly tries anything different and is afraid to take risks. Maybe that's why most modern movies and TV shows suck. There are film making idiots out there that are inspired by him and think it's okay to make nothing but reboot this and remake that! Luckily, I have some common sense and value the entertainment I watch and make. ""Raging Bull"" is one of Martin Scorsese's worst films, just stay away from it. If you want to watch a boxing film, stick with any of the movies in the ""Rocky"" franchise. Those are, without question, the absolute greatest boxing films/sports films of all-time! ""Raging Bull"" deserves to be rammed into the trash.",

This is the only time Scorsese has perfectly structured a rise and fall story. It has a beginning, middle and end yet leaves parts to the imagination. It doesn't focus too much on one era (Goodfellas in the rise, Casino in the fall), yet it never feels like it cuts anything short. De Niro is simply dynamic. He covers such a range of emotions and hits everything perfectly. The ""You *bleeped* my wife!"" and the jail scenes are two of the best I've ever witnessed. I should also mention that this is the only time I haven't wanted to stab Joe Pesci in the head. He became too full of himself and type-cast in his later years, but in this he is just perfect. Moriarty is also heartbreaking and seductive. The score is flawless. It has a very elegant and nostalgic feel to it, which Scorsese crafted to a tee.

Its a science --a craft--not a street fight. This is typical Scorsese....over-cooking the violent scenes once again. Its really quite sad----because the film is pretty good. However, people tend to over rate Robert De Niros performance. I think its because he gallantly gained 60lbs. (27 kg) in weight to play the horrible Jake Lamotta (a guy with LOADS of personality defects) in his post boxing career. Putting that weight on was heroic----but forget that and judge his acting. Its nowhere near the heights he reached in Taxi Driver. (Still his finest hour). Martin Scorsese showed great promise in the 1970s--but he has since been disappointing. (Apart from Goodfellas). Scorsese has never made a 10 / 10 movie. He is a flawed movie director......good.......but certainly not very good , and nowhere near great.

I will say that Joe Pesci did do some decent work here. He breathes life into his character but De Niro just has the same look on his face as he always does. That blank Taxi Driverish stare. That's what he does when he doesn't know what else to do. Anyway, to summarize this idiotic film, Jake La Motta cheats on his wife with a 15 year old girl, gets paranoid, slaps and punches out his brother and his girlfriend, feels sorry for himself. So what does he do next? He gains some weight and hits on 14 year old girls at a bar. Wow.. what a masterpiece. Have I mentioned the completely ridiculous boxing sequences?

As an enormous fan of Scorsese's pre-2000 work, the catalogue of innovative, dark, gripping, and overall classic works that he did seem to be given the most praise, yet the least rewards. Knowing that DeNiro won an Oscar for this film, knowing that Pesci was nominated (but lost) and knowing that Scorsese was also up for one of those prized trophies, yet lost – is extremely aggravating. Martin Scorsese is one of the most influential directors of my time, and probably my parent's time as well. His body of work ranges from angry Taxi Drive, to a suspicious boxer, to a documentary about a Band, and even a comedy about New York after hours. The list could go on, yet modern audiences only remember him as the guy that brought us ""Gangs of New York"" or ""The Departed"", two decent films, but nothing of the caliber that his work from the early 70s had. How can anyone say that ""The Departed"" was more of an Oscar contender than ""Mean Streets""? So, upon watching ""Raging Bull"" for the first time – I was filled with anger and frustration. ""Raging Bull"" is one of those near perfect films that was released in the 80s, yet still seems powerful and relevant today. Perhaps it is the skill of Scorsese behind the camera to give us a non-linear biography of a man who has no trouble destroying his own life. Perhaps it is the sharp editing that takes, what could have been your average sports movie, and transforms it into this pioneering black and white, quick cut by quick cut, journey into the darkness of man. Or perhaps it is the actors, Pesci and DeNiro doing what was genius at the time (Pesci seems to have never let go of Joey La Motta in any of his future roles), and giving us lines, words, and actions that will remain in our minds long after the film is over? Perhaps. Everything about ""Raging Bull"" was perfect, yet the Academy turned away for ""Ordinary People"", thus Scorsese had to wait for the sympathy win to finally claim his victory.

Raging Bull(1980), is a genre mix that transits between Italian neorrealism, semi-documentary, biography and noir. The relation between Jake's personal life and professional career is the great element explored by Scorsese. LaMotta, that unloads all of his efforts to control his wife and brother's lives. It is in the cinematography and in the editing that rests the beauty that makes Raging Bull a grand exhibition of cinema. During the fight scenes, the viscerality and freneticity of the combats are marked by fast cuts, with some perspective of the photographers, abusing of close-ups and blood. As the principal objective from the screenplay is to show Jake's rise to fame and downfall, Scorsese builds the plot so genially, that when the spectator questions why did it all go wrong? He will find only one answer, Jake LaMotta.",

This is NOT a boxing movie in the style of Rocky but a movie about a boxer who has deep seated sexual insecurities and the consequent rage and jealousy that come with it. This is a true story about Jake LaMottas life. He was the middleweight champion of the world in those days and he was a consultant onset throughout the film in order to create a historically correct record of his life. Brutal to watch at times but no punches were pulled in the creation of this movie. If you're a squeamish, sensitive person then skip this. Stick with your Netflix crap.

349,7 June 2023,CinemaSerf,6, Raging Bull,"Sorry but I was really unimpressed with this tale of the life of legendary boxer Jake La Motta. It's based on his own book, so it can be relied upon to be authentic, but somehow this Martin Scorsese effort just fell flat for me. The usual mix of Robert De Niro (La Motta) with probably the least versatile actor I have ever seen on screen, Joe Pesci, as his brother Joey; Cathy Moriarty as his wife Vickie and an ensemble of Italian American co-stars just reminded me of a very much weaker ""Midnight Cowboy"" (1969). Sure, that's not about boxing - but I'm not too sure how much this is about it, either. There is precious little by way of ring action - though what there is is excellently and intensively photographed - for the most part it is more of a soap opera, backed up with loads of expletives and a bit of domestic violence that seems to have come to epitomise the attitudes this New York community have for their womenfolk. There is the usual gangland, fight-fixing, shenanigans but somehow it all comes across as remarkably sterile. I don't really rate De Niro as an actor. Like Pesci, he only really seems to have one gear; one style and it all usually involves him playing well to his own roots, armed with a ripe vocabulary and lots of angry tantrums. At times it is shot like a television movie; the black and white imagery is just too clean and pristine. It seems to be trying for a look that places it contemporaneously in the late 1940s, but instead, for me anyway, it came across more as a film out of it's time. I am certain that I am in the minority here; it played to a very full cinema the other night and received applause at the end, but I am afraid I just cannot see what all the fuss is about.",

The fact that this film did not take home the best picture nomination is an abomination to society equal to that of the holocaust in my eyes. The academy snubbed Scorsese once again, maby it is because they are afraid of the fact that he tells stories that depict characters realistically, characters that are pieces of *#^$, and that beat their wives, or sell drugs, or kill people.

Some may feel that this repetition was essential to build-up the tension, but I think after the first hour, most educated viewers should have already gotten the point. Besides this detail, I thought the film was very good and I give it an 8/10. People should watch this if only to experience the superb job that De Niro and Scorsese have done.

DeNiro, of course, was outstanding, and its always nice to see little Joe Pesci beat the precious body fluid out of some poor sap, but LaMotta was no one special to write about (I guess that's why he took it upon himself).

The sound effects sounded like something from a sixties movie. But it's quite good to include the famous element of Italian American culture of ties to the mafia. De Niro's acting is just truly superb. His facial expressions are nicely fitting just as what he did in ""The King of Comedy"" for comparison. He went total for this by gaining weight to make his suitable look for the older version of LaMotta.",
371,27 January 2019,lisamcdonnell0816,8," Raw and gritty, not a feel-good film.","The Raging Bull, released in 1980, is a film directed by Martin Scorsese and stars Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci as brothers Jake and Joey LaMotta. Jake LaMotta was a popular boxer turned controversial figure in the 1940's and 50's. DeNiro drove the vision of the film, as he was fascinated with LaMotta's life. Raging Bull takes the viewer on a journey through the rise to success and ultimate demise of a talented but troubled athlete. It was shot in black and white, to not only pay homage to 1940's boxing, but to reflect the darkness of the subject matter. The film is not for the faint of heart, as it is peppered with scenes of dramatic violence. Not only violence during the intimately-filmed boxing scenes, but domestic violence between LaMotta and both his first and second wives. The combination of Scorsese's direction, and DeNiro's acting is magical. The movie generates an emotional response throughout the entire 2 hours and 9 minutes of running time. From the beginning, when a young LaMotta is navigating through the boxing world, as well as his relationships with his brother and associates, until the end when he is breaking down alone in his jail cell, the viewer feels like they have been on this emotional roller coaster right along with him. All of the characters are from low-to-middle class neighborhoods in New York, are uneducated and lack a governor on their emotions. Scenes can sway from pleasant and touching to explosive in just a few short minutes. In one scene, Joey (LaMotta's brother, played by Pesci) is eating dinner with his family, and he threatens to stab his son with a knife if he doesn't stop playing with his food. The beginning of the story elicits a sense of hope. Jake LaMotta is winning fights, becoming a more seasoned fighter and starting a life with his second wife, Vickie. While the circumstances of their courtship were questionable, with Jake being married and Vickie being only 15 years old, the love between them seems to soften Jake and give him more purpose in life. Ultimately, Jake's demons overcome him. They creep in slowly, starting with fits of insecurity and jealously, and spiral into violence, substance abuse and other reckless behavior. DeNiro physically transformed himself, gaining 60 pounds to portray the fighter turned comedian and sleazy club owner. By the end of the movie, Vickie has become fed up and leaves LaMotta, who is ultimately arrested for nefarious activities in his nightclub. Any movie that can create a personal connection between the viewer and characters can be considered excellent, in my opinion, and the Raging Bull did exactly that.",

The storytelling is incredible and I love, simply love the way he chose to tell the story and one of the reasons is how he edited the film. It's truly some of the best editing I have seen in film. I believe one of the reasons it took me awhile to watch Raging Bull is because of how Martin and the cinematographer decided to shoot the film in black and white, but it didn't make the movie bad but the opposite.

I will admit, okay some of his acting talents were okay emotionally. The supporting actor Joe Pesci also like Robert De Niro's acting-some good but most bad. And i know that the film was released in black and white because of the mood and atmosphere of the film, but it lingers far too long. Finally the directing was class c from Martin Scorsese and most probably his worst film. The boxing scenes are meant to be in your face-bold, long, bloody and violent. Instead most of them are at least 30 seconds to a minute long, its pathetic. Even the final championship fight was only something like 30 seconds.

Sure there a lot of Motta's fights shown, but half of them are less than two minutes and mostly show time spent at the end, beginning, and in the corner. The other half is a few stills of the match combined with the who, when, and where. The grand total is less than 15 minutes. They don't even talk about boxing much or show Motta train. Most of the movie is about Motta's private life. That is not very interesting either. I got no emotion from the story at all. Scorsese also tried to convey that Motta and Sugar Ray Robinson were rivals. Other than them fighting a lot, that never comes across. Other problems include the blood effects and continuity of the blood. The blood squirts out in a very unrealistic fashion. When blood does get on someone, it is gone in the next shot.",

I have watched the three movies of Scorsese in order of watching: ""Goodfellas"", ""Casino"", and ""Raging Bull"" and now I have feeling that I have watched one unique movie three times. The order of watching this triplet was vice versa with respect to the date of their production. I'm not going to give jargons or use cinema terminology but as simple as it is I have to mention that if I were to name these movies I would name them sth1, sth2, and sth3. It has a similarity with Sergio Leone's triplet: ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", ""For a Few Dollars More"", and ""A Fistful of Dollars"" which I think it's not fair to call them all alike. Basically it is a couple consisting ""For a Few Dollars More"", and ""A Fistful of Dollars"". Anyway, Scorsese's triplet has its own philosophy and tries to deliver some good documentary view of American society, but still I cannot accept that these three movies are different. One of them could be enough for once in a lifetime watching. Scorsese is a professional and belittling big people doesn't reduce their real values and I'm not going to do that. I'm talking as an audience who has seen this triplet and happen to know the name of the director. That's all.

Joe Pesci is the perfect counterpart to De Niro - taking considerable burdens off De Niro and letting him craft La Motta in a way not seen in today's movies.

From his early boxing days to his downfall along with his abusive way of treating people. Losing everyone who loved him and losing his job until he becomes a comedian in a bar. Jake Lamotta's story is a hard one but when it's portrayed on screen it's beautiful. DeNiro seems to always have great roles in his movies and there isn't one movie that is considered the best role he's ever played. His portrayal of Lamotta is incredible and amazing. Joe Pesci is always a pleasure to have in any movie, he's a funny guy. I loved how at one point during the film you can see the lifestyle of Jake and his family in pictures with colors while the whole movie is in black and white, it may be a hard feature to notice if you watch the movie for the first time but once you notice it's there, it's a good easter egg. Scorsese has done a great job adapting the biography of Jake Lamotta to a film (the movie is based on the biography that Lamotta wrote). I really love this movie and recommend it to all viewers and Scorsese fans out there.",
401,23 February 2003,coolvalleydude,10, A Masterpiece,"This movie is a masterpiece.  It has high artistic quality.  This is the best movie in the 80s, period.  Robert De Niro's acting in this movie is outstanding.  It's one of the best acting I have ever seen in my life.  He portrays a violent man who thrives on to take a beating and give a beating. He expresses his emotions through violence.  I highly recommend this movie.",
402,8 March 2003,SanTropez_Couch,10, The Himalayan highpoint of Scorsese and De Niro,"I've experienced a lot of things watching Martin Scorsese's movies, but I've never been moved. Granted I haven't seen his ""woman picture"" (""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"") or his period piece (""The Age of Innocence""), and the ones I have seen -- maybe with the exception of ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" -- don't deal with feelings as much as they do with repressed and let-loose emotions. This is the first time I finished watching one of his movies and sat for a second thinking about the story, the characters and my own feelings, as well as Scorsese's virtuoso filmmaking technique.",
403,23 November 2019,batmanorgiants,5, Sigh,"I came into this movie with high expectations and I was just left with a sad, depressing story that meandered to the point where Cathy leaves Jimmy and Joey stops talking to him as well. Jimmy is supposed to be a unlikable, insecure jerk but there is no true defining moment to me where I can find something endearing to Jimmy's character. I love movies with flawed characters: clockwork orange, good fellas, Taxi driver, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, there will be blood, no country for old men, her and etc. But there was something there that made me like or at least be sympathetic to those characters. I'll compare him to Travis, who's also played brilliantly by Robert De Niro, and I would argue at their cores, Travis is a way more despicable character then Jimmy. But Scorsese's directing really elevates the point of view Travis has of the filth in New York. His failings with romantic and friendship relationships is relatable and it adds another interesting characteristic of Travis. Travis is a sexist, rude, insecure, PTSD ridden paranoia induced man but I still end up understanding his plan through the end. In Raging Bull, the only nuance to Jimmy's struggles is how he takes his sexual and jealous emotions out on other boxers instead of expressing his feelings in a healthy way to his family. I wanted jimmy to lose every match and I was glad to see Cathy and Joey sees contact from him. Good, let him rot as a fat, drunken bar owner. The reason why this movie isn't ranked lower however Is due to De Niro, Pesci and Moriarty's fantastic performances, Scorsese's masterful directing, the good soundtrack (although I think it was played a bit too obnoxiously in the boxing montages) and the great editing. It's just the script that I hate. It was a bucket list movie and I look forward to never seeing it again.",
404,2 March 2008,adlei_b,10, Awesome movie,"Some of the comments regarding this film make me scratch my head until I'm scratching bone. This IS a classic movie. Make no mistake. De Niro didn't get an Oscar simply for putting on a lot of weight, his portrayal of Jake La Motta is spot on. De Niro acts the part out in perfect symmetry with La Motta's autobiography. Since when was it important to have characters to whom you can feel sympathy leading the film? Do you feel sympathy for Jeff Bridges in the Big Lebowski? He's a stoned waster doing nothing with his life, but that's a classic. And does every film need to have a message for us? I'd feel a bit offended if every film I payed good money to see attempted to preach some sort of fable down my throat just so I can leave and think I saw a good film. What do West Side Story and the Bourne films teach us? Don't fall in love with someone you shouldn't and don't get involved in illegal Government operations? Why thankyou for telling me. Maybe I'm spending more time challenging this movie's haters rather than bigging it up, but I hope that that reflects positively on the movie. It's worth defending against people who feel hard done by because the movie was too taxing for them. The boxing scenes are amazing in this film, better than any of the boxing scenes in the Rocky films - which are excellent movies as well. La Motta said De Niro could have gone on to become a pro boxer he was so good after training up. The black and white, in my opinion, lends itself perfectly to catching the brutal violence that is central to the movie, spit and blood flying everywhere, impressing on the viewer the visceral nature of boxing and Jake La Motta. He's no hero, but that's no reason not to make a film about him. Great film, great acting from everyone involved - Joe Pesci has some serious napoleon syndrome going on - and an overall entertaining experience.",

409,17 August 2007,claytonators,1, Raging Bullshit Indeed,"First Mean Streets then Taxi Driver then this. Martin Scorsese is defiantly the most overrated director in history and De Niro is just a terrible actor. The Academy awards must have been high on something that year to give De Niro an Oscar for gaining weight. He was supposed to win an Oscar for best 'acting' not for best weight gainer of the year. People who don't see that must need some help. I agree with STAN39520. It should be burned (along with Taxi Driver), and if anybody else directed this or stared in it they would pay no attention to it. So what makes Martin Scorsese great, huh! To me, the only great films hes ever done are 'Cape Fear', 'The Aviator', 'Casino' and the 'The Departed'. I really felt like i was doing a sinful thing watching this piece of crap! One of the greatest films of all time they say, one of the 'worst' films of all time. A boxing film with hardly no boxing in it. ",

It was on Channel 4FX Sat. March 1st.  The language is atrocious, but the direction is extremely well done by Martin Scorsces.  It was a black and white film and some actual fight scenes were in it.  Although he was a winner, his life was full of crooks and family and a tragic ending",
411,24 June 2006,PaulNewmanIsDead,9, Brilliance...sheer brilliance.,"And that's the best way to sum up this breathtaking film. Not only does Robert De Niro give his absolute best performance of his career, but Scorsese's direction is perhaps the greatest of his storied career as well. This film manages to strike a nerve with the audience and come off as incredibly unique because of not only the films different take on the classic narrative structure, but the gritty black and white add a sense of surrealness to the entire picture, making it seem like a gritty nightmare. The boxing scenes are probably the greatest to ever be photographed, and perhaps the most brutal. Joe Pesci chimes in with HIS best performance of his career as well. However, make no mistake, while this is a brilliant piece of art, it's still not the best boxing film to ever be made; that honor goes to Rocky. I will however say, that this is perhaps the best movie to ever be made ABOUT a boxer.",
412,12 December 2008,weekly-movie-review,9," Not just a great boxing movie, a great movie altogether!","Raging Bull is a poetic boxing movie based on Jake La Motta's autobiography. It details his rise to glory and fall from grace during the 40's and 50's. The central character is played superbly by Robert De Niro. In fact, De Niro established his name in legend when he gained an estimated 70 pounds during filming. Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci also perform at their absolute best as the wife and brother, respectively. Moriarty, with her deep, sexy voice, conveys a since of mental toughness that matches De Niro punch for punch. Pesci is his usual maniac self by showing amazing aggression and anger at times. But of course, none of this is possible without Martin Scorsese's direction. This is a true masterpiece, with black-and-white cinematography, an elegant soundtrack, and amazing costumes and props. The writing is fluid and thought-provoking and the story is as memorable as a Greek tragedy. This is one that all must see, whether you are a boxing fan or not.",

In this film, Actor Robert De Niro, plays the character Jake La Motta. La Motta is an up and coming boxer who lives in New York. He is accompanied by his coach, and brother Joey who is played by Joe Pesci. This movie depicts La Motta's boxing career and the ups and downs along the way.

The film depicts the chaotic and turbulent life of middleweight champ Jake LaMotta as he punches and rages his way to the title and the world around him. LaMotta's personal and professional life seethe and simmer as the film takes the viewer from his dreams of getting the title to his career triumph all the way to his physical and professional decline. The violence and mayhem permeate as one can feel the tension throughout where anywhere and anytime something or someone will explode. The brutality of the ring is ably shown with choreographed highlights of gloves busting at swollen and bleeding faces with blood squirting everywhere. Robert De Niro won an Oscar in the lead performance and he certainly is the centrepiece as he slugs and rages through his complex and terrible character. Although somewhat slow-going for a fight film with too much emphasis on the drama of LaMotta's personal life this is certainly one of the best Boxing portrayals made for film.

The film revolves around the professional and personal life of Jake during his peak years about how got to the top ranks as a boxer. In the meantime, due to his short temper, jealousy and anger his personal life detoriates. After a long run of undefeated streak as a professional boxer, due to his bad temper and jealousy his wife and brother leaves him.

The movie ends with Jake asking his estranged brother's forgiveness in the dark recesses of a parking garage. I, like many viewers found Jake's carnal nature amusing the first time I watched this movie. However, on second viewing, isn't what makes the movie great is that it is also about Jake being manipulated by his brother Joey who tries to control Jake by setting Jake up with his wife Vicki and sells out Jake's high moral intentions by asking Jake to throw a fight? To me this movie is not just about love carnal, but Jake accepting his role in his depravity and asking and accepting forgiveness from whom might be considered the enemy of his moral standard. Jake finds eternal love. He's a contender!",

Check out Paper Moon footage against this very shadowy movie, or even some Orsen Wells films. The red filter used on these movies creates a sharpness and a contrast that is missing. However, the movie does represent the film making techniques of the time with a ""Casablacaish"" mystique. The characters fade into each other, and the outstanding acting becomes the central focus. Scorcesse's camera angles are the best since Kubrick, when LaMotta goes down with the three-hundred sixty degree camera shot, it precludes Spike Lee's signature move.",

Thelma Schoonmaker's editing takes us away from the comfort of ringside and sets us directly upon the stool before the bell rings. Robert DeNiro as Jake LaMotta relates to us what he is thinking and feeling between jabs and feints and sometimes through the pile driver blows he delivers to his opponents. Director Martin Scorsese while reluctant to treat of this subject at first, masterfully takes his actor into those realms where Laurence Olivier has been known to tread, ably supported by a cast of characters peopled with capable newcomers such as Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci. Moriarty plays his wife Vikki LaMotta and Pesci his brother, Joey. The atmosphere is a noir as you can get, and the darkness seems to come from both inside as well as outside the characters.",

The moody black and white that Scorsese used to film this really adds to the feel of things- it is almost a contrast to the events. Not every choice is labeled in black and white, there are fine subtleties that distort your perception... The boxing is raw- hard hitting beautiful.

De niro, whose career is better than all the other actors, with films like The Godfather Part II, Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, The King Of Comedy, Once Upon A Time In America, Goodfellas, Heat, Casino and recently Joker, and yet Jake La Motta in Raging Bull is his best performance. He even got an Oscar to back my statement. The method acting crossed another height with this movie. De Niro gained 60 pounds(don't know how much that is but sounds and looked heavy) for this role and became a semi professional boxer. So, yeah, this is his best performance.

De Niro portrays Jake LaMotta, a raging and self-destructive boxer, hence his nickname ""The Raging Bull"". But actually the film isn't about boxing, that's just the setting. The real themes are paranoia and jealousy; about how a man desires a beautiful woman at first, but due to insecurity loses his touch with reality and dwells into mistrusting every move she makes. Freud called it the Madonna-whore complex, look it up ;) The performances are great, and De Niro rightfully received an Oscar for best actor. During this movie he transforms from a fit young prizefighter to an overweight retired old man, gaining an astounding 33 kg! But everything is right in this movie; the directing, the editing, the use of black & white, the camera-work, the supporting actors. Without a doubt a Great Movie and one of the best of the '80. ",
446,3 February 2011,dickey08,9, Insight to an insecure and paranoid man,"Raging Bull is a film staring Robert Dinero as Jake La Motta, the champion mid-weight fighter of the 1940's through the 1960's. The film shows La Motta's successful boxing career, his struggle to remain uninvolved with the mob, as well as his turbulent relationships with his wife Vickie and brother Joey, played by Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci, Jake La Motta brings violence into each aspect of his life, repeatedly abusing Vickie, whom he believes is constantly scheming to be unfaithful to him. This violence and jealousy is most likely caused by Jake's feeling of inadequacy, the underlying theme of the film. ",

For the most part this is justified. Call me crazy, but I found some major flaws in this film. First, La Matta's relationship with his first wife is obviously tumultuous, however, we see them argue, and then La Matta and his brother go out together, and of course La Matta meets and falls in love with the blonde Vicki, but after that point we don't see his first wife again. She simply vanishes from the story! The audience is left wondering, what happened to his first wife? Deniro's character shows very little wit early on with the exception of the scene at the club with his wife when he says ""Why don't i beat the sh#t of of bout of yous and then you can f##k each other"" Aside from that, he is humorless. Obviously a talented boxer, and an emotional wreck, at the end of the story, he jumps into being a Lenny Bruce type stand up at clubs and eventually opens his own club playing host to groups of people and is the life of the party! where did this side of his character materialize out of? How did this happen? ",

The violence, verite', and 'honest' acting was supposed to make it relevant. Most of all, the concensus of movie critic books that I glanced through couldn't be wrong, could it? 4 stars out of 4, etc etc.
Now I just view it as boring and exploitive, of Lamotta, no less. I'm sure he adored the movie, but it only focuses in, with a clumsily implemented style. on the bad elements of LaMotta's life, failing to show complexities, and failing to provide any redemptive arc.
Despite showing all of the abusive behavior, there's no genuine element of self-reflection in the movie, despite the fact that LaMotta was completely
forthright about his life and his demons.
I think the movie would've been far better in the hands of another director.

The boxing scenes are some of the finest film work ever done. Robert De Niro delivers the best performance of his career so far, and in doing so, gives the greatest acting performance I've ever seen. De Niro is unbelieveably raw and emotional. His portrayal of LaMotta fills the screen. Cathy Moriarty is very good in her role as is Joe Pesci.

The fight scenes highlight the brutality and violence of boxing. They also set the table for who LaMotta is as a person. He's successful and famous for physically beating other men, sometimes gruesomely, before they can do the same to him. Without his gloves on, he's still the same person. Controlling, paranoid, and violent, he abuses his wife and obsesses over whether she's cheating on him or even thinking about other men.

The dialogue is top notch, (not as creative as say a Tarantino flick, but about as realistic as I've ever heard in a film), and not only holds your attention, but makes you laugh, cringe, and, (if you're an emotional person), maybe even cry. Directed by Martin Scorsese, it is by far his best film, and ranks him, in my mind, the best director in the industry today, (until he retires that is).

All of these films and characters have one common theme and that is the character and essence of humanity. Cinematically Raging Bull is a brilliant film that works in all the right ways and pushes all the right emotional buttons. Robert Deniro as always was phenomenal and I also have to give props to Joe Pesci who actually plays a likable character in this one.

SPOILER ALERT The story tells the story of a boxer, named Jake La Motta and whose brother, Joey, played incredibly well by Joe Pesci. Soon Jake falls for Vickie, a very attractive girl and they fall in love, which in my opinion was a different kind of love for both of them. Jake was looking for someone to take care of him, but Vickie was looking for man to satisfy her need for a father figure. From there the story progresses and it shows in the most eleoquen detail the fall of a great boxer. In it it involves the mafia and its gambling, it involves love and the fall of a once-great figure in boxing, it involes portraying life in a manner of luck having to do a lot with what happens with, and the detruction of a man caught by his own paranoia of thinking his wife is cheating on him.",

When i first saw this movie I didn't think it was something special, but the second time. I really learnt to love it, This movie is so much more than just a boxing movie, its about in a short sentence, Jake LaMotta's life. De Niro potraited and acted Jake LaMotta so good that I got breathless. This movie don't have any flaws. Completely flawless, the directing is so beautiful done and the acting from Cathie Moriarty and especially Joe Pesci is great. This is Joe Pesci's at his best. And De Niro too. 4years earlier De Niro was staring in my favourite movie Taxidriver(best movie of all time) And that roll I think is a little bit better. Now back to Raging bull, The scene with De Niro when he is fighting with Joey(pesci) that acting is so beautifully done. The silence in the room, and the creepy feeling that something have got wrong is so fun to see.Why does this movie so good? Because you can watch it over and over again and still find things you never have seen before. And you don't see that a lot in movies, It's very rare.

495,13 March 2023,den_quixote,3, Arrogant egotism on display throughout,"By most accounts Deniro is given credit for the creation of this colossal display of egotism because of his reading of Jake LaMotta's autobiography. Only an actor could read the life story of such a piece of human garbage and think to himself, ""this will make a great movie."" For some reason a great talent like Paul Schrader agreed to write the screenplay, for which he should be required to resign from the writer's guild. Jake and Tommy LaMotta grew up in NYC and saw Jake's boxing talent as a way for them both to escape that environment. He became a success but could not get a championship fight without first becoming partners with the local Mafia chief. Eventually Tommy, the manager, makes the agreement that will require Jake to throw a fight before he ultimately gets to fight the champion. If this were the entire plot you might think ""why remake ""Body and Soul?"" It was a classic and seemingly impossible to improve, though someone later failed by trying. But there was much more. We get to explore Jake's sick jealousy and debauchery, Tommy's infidelity and animalistic behaviour and even poor old ""Coach"" as a psycho Mafia don. There is no arguable reason for making this movie, other than to demonstrate the ridiculous lengths that Robert Deniro will go to to win an Academy Award.

496,1 January 2009,Milanista90,10, Raw and Powerful...DeNiro is a Beast,"Oh man, I had heard the hype, but nothing can prepare you for this monster of a movie. Let's get right to the point: this movie belongs to the DeNiro. From the opening credits, the audience knows that this guy is going to take us on a roller coaster ride, I mean it is that good. This is not an ordinary boxing movie, nor is it an extraordinary one; it is a character analysis at its best. Although the film's premise involves boxing, the overall thematic idea revolves around the human condition, in this case the self destructive DeNiro. Joe Peschi is also great, but not in a dominating kind of way, as he is primarily there to complement DeNiro; keep him dormant, although that becomes a daunting, if not impossible, task. Scorsese truly manages to capture the essence of the beast in DeNiro, and while I still think Goodfellas is his best film, Raging Bull is hands down the best collaboration between the two of them. This is an epic movie, I cannot stress that enough. No review can do it justice, as one cannot judge perfection. This is easily one of top ten greatest movies ever made, and that is an undeniable fact. Don't expect a subtle movie, because this is intense, in your face, entertainment.

People are correct when they say that DeNiro's performance as La Motta ranks as one of the greatest of all time, but great acting does not necessarily equate to a great movie, and the weak script ultimately overshadows both DeNiro's performance and Scorsese's directing to result in a movie that falls short of it's potential.",
503,13 December 2017,vikram-77547,3, One of the overrated movie,"I generally don't write reviews for the movie, but having watched this movie because of the high rating on the IMDB, I was compelled to write review so that I would be able to save precious 2 hrs of other viewers. To summarize the movie: a great boxer who is unable to control his temper, fights with everyone including his wife and brother and lead a life of misery. Thats it. There is nothing great in this movie.
 Now lets go through the reasons for high rating of this movie. The first reason is this movie has a great actor and a great director. I agree that the actor and director are great, but does that mean that the movie is great? Cant best people in a field create a mediocre product? The second reason is DeNiro has gained and lost weight for this movie. Now come-on how can an actor gaining a weight for a movie can make the movie great. This has been done by so many people before this and after this. Should not the movie have something that captures the attention of audience? The third reasoni is that, the movie is based on real boxer. Now if the life of boxer is an average life, then there is nothing great in the movie. The fourth reason is some boxing scene. There are lot of movies that have such scenes and this is nothing new. However, the few boxing scenes were reason I rated this movie as 3 star. Another reason is the domestic violence and a fight scene in club for a very silly reason. I don't understand how can this be a reason for making a movie great. There are lots of movie which have violence for silly reasons and we rate such movies as B grade movies.
 There a few good scene in the movie, but thats it. Those few scenes hardly span 10 to 15 minutes of the movie. Similar to this movie I consider ""boyhood"", ""shining"", ""deer Hunter"" to be another examples of overrated movies. I hope my writing will save 2 hours of someone's life.",

Watch LaMotta standing passively in the ring, taking hit after hit, blood spraying everywhere - ""You didn't get me down, Ray."" Shot in gorgeous black-and-white, aside from one beautiful home-footage montage, the single camera weaves and glides inside the ring, acting as a third boxer. Watch the dolly zoom on Sugar Ray Robinson, or that jaw-dropping oner, following Jake from his room through to the stands and crowds, up and up to his only home. De Niro bares it all, unmatchably intense in interactions with his wife and brother (Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci, both equally excellent), then pathetic as a fat, broken bar owner. Watch him wail against the wall of a jail cell, or practice his monologue in front of a mirror, poorly reciting Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront - ""I could've been a contender.""

Indeed the closest thing you can compare it to is Bergman's persona. This film is not only a powerful and impossibly well crafted story, it is a stylistic breakthrough for a cinematic artist who had already taken international cinema by storm. Indeed, here we see emerge the fully mature Scorsese, who couldn't have gone on to make Goodfellas or the Departed without making this film first. While he always had a mastery of subjective photography and slow motion, in Raging Bull his camera is so fluid, so reluctant to stop moving, that you can almost hear Max Olphus weeping for its freedom.

The strong performances are countered with the throbbing music and dancing edits.

Sadly this is a common demise among many boxers that have & have not reached the pinnacle of the boxing world.

There's some outrageous moments but I'd always find myself sympathising with ""LaMotta"" which comes down to ""DeNiro's"" flawless talent under ""Scorsese"" direction.

Rather, it is about the stunning interplay between the soul and its outmost needs, and the ever present contrast between the physical, and the emotional and spiritual.",
525,22 January 2020,labontearia,5, Outdated,"Raging Bull is a biographic film based on the memoir of the same name. It is based on the life of boxer Jake LaMotta and the viewer is granted access into LaMotta's prime and subsequent 20 following years. We learn that LaMotta (played by Robert DeNiro) is an Italian man with a skill for boxing in a particularly vicious and brutal style which, is not surprising, when we learn of the man he is outside of the ring. In the beginning of the film we meet a younger Jake who is in a tumultuous marriage. Him and his wife seem to be having a heated argument, and yet, his brother reminds him later, he's still a married man. This doesn't stop him however from pursuing a young (read: 15 year old) blond women whom he eventually courts and marries (of course, first, the viewer assumes he divorces his first wife).
The rest of the film's story isn't really much better. We are subject to various fight scenes where LaMotta occasionally loses (although he never falls) and more where he wins. However, more often than not the movie circles around his obsessive jealousy regarding his wife and the unfair treatment she receives. He is controlling and irrational and seemingly destroys his own life because of his insane jealousy, even at one point, fighting and alienating his own brother (who is perhaps the only person who has LaMotta's back).
Eventually, to the relief of this viewer, LaMotta's wife finally gets a divorce and moves out. LaMotta meanwhile is busy hosting comedy routines at a club and hooking up with very underage girls (read: 14 years old) as well as setting them up with older men. However, for once, things seem to catch up with LaMotta who is jailed for introducing older men to underage girls.
Does LaMotta ever really get his comeuppance? You can be the judge of that, because the film actually ends with LaMotta out of jail and ready to put on his comedy routine at a new joint (all while reminding himself he's still a champion).
Do we really need a movie about this guy? Personally, I fail to see the story or meaning or glory behind an athlete who beats his wife and treats everyone around him poorly. There's nothing glamorous about jealous rage (maybe in the ring there is, but that might just be lost on someone who doesn't appreciate sports anyways).
All this said, this movie was not poorly made. DeNiro is a fabulous actor, committing to the role so intensely he is nearly unrecognizable. His acting is superb and, somehow, even moving, despite portraying such a gross person. Scorsese is an excellent director who chose shots that evoked emotion. The jail scene in particular, shrouded in darkness that is highlighted even more against the black and white nature of the film, made me feel a large amount of pity for a character I grew to dislike. Other shots of the movie feel raw and real, especially the fights that occurred outside of the ring which left me with my mouth hanging open.
Was it one of the best movies of all time? Certainly you should be the judge of that. While I grew to dislike the story as well as Jake LaMotta and his tale, I found the editing, production, and acting to be outstanding. This movie definitely deserves at least one shot if you've never seen it. 5/10",

It contains scenes portraying domestic abuse and shows the mental breakdown of a man with jealousy and anger issues. DeNiro performs wonderfully in this film directed by one of the great American filmmakers; Martin Scorsese. While there is little to like about our lead, not only is the acting brilliant, but so is the camerawork. For a black and white film, Scorsese does well to make the gore realistic, giving the viewer closeups on pummeled faces to show the true gruesome nature of the sport. Personally, this is my favorite sports movie, it's one of Scorsese's greatest films and it undoubtedly holds up under scrutiny today.",

Feel the film lacks building the storyline and we can often guess how it will take place why its a story its repetive and feels that it goes no where. Some of the scenes are of slow movement. But the style and the action on drama are very well told some of the strongest parts of the film. Feel more could have been told but purely focus on the anger.

I always heard buzz about this film, and I have not seen many Martin Scorsese films, but this is a true American movie! The screenplay is a true force to be reckoned with. It reminded me a bit of other epic films like Citizen Kane and There Will be Blood, the way the main character plays out is similar, but this film is different, as in the character Jake La Motta is based on a real person. Martin Scorsese really commanded the screen. There are truly some amazingly written and acted scenes. This is a boxing film, but a very much human film too. Robert De Niro really gave his best, and it turns out to be one of the best performances I have ever seen! His performance ranges from his bad times, to his guilt, to his madness and anger. It is all played out perfectly. Joey La Motta, his brother, played brilliantly by Joe Pesci is also a strong supporting character, who follows Jake through a lot. Another strong character is Vicky Thailer, played by the back then unknown Cathy Moriarty. What these three characters go through is amazing. This film is a joy to watch too. Certain scenes, some sensuality between Jake and Vicky are not really sexually graphic, yet have so much pleasure in them, the way Scorsese teases us. Scenes like where Jake suspects Vicky and Joey together, and in their fight all of a sudden are so well done and acted, I could not stare away.",

While Scorsese's virtuoso technique in Raging Bull is up there at the top of cinematic achievement, both the themes explored in the film and LaMotta's life story are not that compelling.

The film starred; Robert De Niro as the main character Jake La Motta, Cathy Moriarty as Vickie La Motta and Joe Pesci as Joey ( Jakes older brother). This film shows deep relationships that Jake has with his wife, family and himself. Jake La Motta is a boxer whom never seems happy with his life. Jake La Motta is an extremely jealous and controlling person. He could be considered as border line bipolar. Throughout this movie La Motta proves that he cannot have a trusting relationship even with people he loves the most. In the beginning, Jake is married to a woman that he does not get along with. Later, he meets a young woman named Vickie. Jake and Vickie get married, and eventually have three children. Jake wins almost every fight, yet he is left always wanting more. Jakes brother Joey sets up fight with an up and coming boxer that Jakes wife said was good looking. Although La Motta wins this match his life is falling apart. Jakes is paranoid and his life soon starts to spiral out of control. Ultimately he ends up losing what he loves the most, his brother, wife and children. Even though this movie is about boxing, prior knowledge of boxing and the time period is not required to understand the theme. My understanding of the theme is about a man who is consistently struggling with himself to find happiness. Jake La Motta never truly finds happiness in his life. In one scene Jake is talking to his brother Joey about his hands being too small. Jake thought that if his hands were bigger he could fight the heavy weight champ and really be happy. After Jake meets Vicki his second wife, he still is not happy. He is winning left and right but is still missing something in his life. Jake starts to feel like his wife is having feelings for someone else. Jake being the jealous person he is lets this feeling consume him. He accused his brother of having an affair with his wife Vickie. Jake beats Joey up and they do not speak for many years. I believe this film is about trying to find happiness and completing one's life: something Jake La Motta was unable to do. ",

549,14 May 2005,DorseyTV,10, Incredible Editing,"When I first saw ""Raging Bull"", I had been video editing for about 8 years for WGBH-TV in Boston. Raging Bull not only validated every belief I ever had of what editing should be, but it also opened a ""new door"" for me. It showed me that a good edit pulls you in - not only to the story but makes you part of it. You live in the film and you're that ""fly on the wall,"" taking in all the facts and the nuances. I think one of the greatest actors with nuances has got to be Dinero - I just watch his face and then it's like you know what he's thinking - he's so good! What I learned from this film is to slow down, allow people to really look at what you're trying to show them - Dinero's subtle gestures are not lost in the edit. Don't overpower the viewer with fast cuts or explosive music - sometimes the natural sounds, like the pounding a heartbeat or the raspy breathing as a fighters pulls on ""everything he's got,"" are the most effective. Everything about Raging Bull is so great - the story, the writing, the direction, the camera, but the editing - the editing is inspiring - she allows us to really see what's going on and to hear it. The editor is such an incredible talent!!!",
550,5 February 2014,stephe63,7, Robert De Niro serves up a knockout,Raging Bull is a magical documentary turned into a film. The film highlights the life of the famous boxer Jake La Motta played by the great Robert De Niro. The movie goes far beyond La Motta's path of greatness in the ring but also into his own personal bouts.,
551,18 November 2002,ibbi,10, Masterpiece.,This film is probably the finest work to date from Director Martin Scorsese. Perhaps the reason for this success was the way in which Scorsese was able to realte to LaMotta through out the making of this film. Obviously Marty was going through many problems in his life and instead of giving up and retiring he chose to translate what was happening to him through this film.,
552,12 October 2014,ck3157-131-694473,8, Raging Bull: A Mistakenly Flopped Masterpiece,"""Go get 'em, champ."" Jake LaMotta tells himself right before the credits role of the 1980 box office flop Raging Bull, directed by Martin Scorsese, starring his life long friends and award winning actors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. Despite it's shameful box office performance, (making only $23 million with a budget of $18 million), the movie is considered a classic and one of the best films of it's time. It was nominated for eight Oscars: Best Actor in a Leading Role (Robert De Niro), Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty), Best Director (Martin Scorsese), Best Cinematography, and Best Sound. It only won two of the eight Oscars (Best Actor in a Leading Role: Robert De Niro, and Best Film Editing). Many question why it did so bad at the Box Office despite it's great reviews and ratings, one of which landing it at #112 of IMDb's Top 250 movies of all time. Perhaps it lacked the ""feel good, underdog victory"" aspect related to Rocky (1976), or it could be that many movie-goers go to see films to escape from the harsh realities of life rather than be confronted with them. However, the use of black and white and lighting proves the film as one the of the best of it's time. De Niro's intense performance of a conflicted up and coming boxer dealing with not only the stresses of being an athlete but with his ongoing (and abusive) feuds with his wife (Cathy Moriarty) and manager/brother (Joe Pesci) prove he was unmatched at the time, deserving his Oscar. Despite the brutal, violent, and ultimately depressing themes of the film, the second collaboration of Scorsese and De Niro proves through it's acting, directing, and cinematography that it deserved to have done much better at the box office.",

No movie has portrayed boxing the way this one has, however (and a big one, as you can see from my rating) it's not for everyone. Black and white, some still shots, an occasional color gives the movie charm, but it's slow paced, seems to be leading to nowhere. That's why I couldn't bring myself to finish it. Watched an hour or so, but watching the mediocre acting and not so great dialogue, weird actions from characters, I was a bit dissapointed. But I hope my review doesn't hold you back from watching the movie. You should see at least an hour of. Or maybe even finish.

559,10 May 2023,Sciluke,10, Incredible,"The film is amazing in everything. The film chronicles the crazy life, rise and fall of a boxer. The film lives in an incredible black and white, probably to recall the Hollywood aesthetics of the 30/40s. The direction is extraordinary, it has so many interesting ideas that every 3 seconds you find yourself amazed. The acting is extraordinary, De Niro and Pesci flawless, perfect. As perfect as the writing, and Schrader reconfirms himself as an extraordinary writer. Personally, I really appreciated the structure of the film, which largely shows the boxer's private life and which makes the film a very dramatic film rather than a ""sports"" film, and shows all the consequences of the protagonist's private life in every single hit that the opponent receives. Every single scene gives food for thought, right from the start, even Jake LaMotta's simple initial Shadow boxing in the ring, with that almost angelic photography is perfect. Every facial expression, every body movement is perfect. Every single minute the film tries to show the ""humanity"" of the protagonist, who cannot resist sexual temptations even before such an important meeting, who is totally insanely jealous with his wife, even though it was originally he has to betray, and not the other way around. Personally this movie left me speechless, and it's one of the best movies I've ever seen, Martin Scorsese is reconfirmed as one of the best ever, along with Schrader, De Niro, Pesci, etc.",

Not only is it truly appreciated by film buffs from a technical aspect, it is at the same time, thoroughly entertaining. Plots involving self-destructive behavior ala Lamotta is a fascinating tragedy and the realism comes through in the movie. What a cast and director. One of the greatest of all time. 30 years later and it doesn't even seem dated. Looking back now and seeing the pairing of Bobby D. and Pesci, it's classic in every sense. And after all, it's a true story. Love it. I put it up there with The Shining, The Godfather, 2001 Space Odyssey, and Gummo.",
563,15 June 2021,samuelanthonytaunton,8, An exploration of male animalistic rage - Review and Analysis,"'Raging Bull' is a very aptly named title for this Scorsese masterpiece. Throughout the film, we grow more and more accustomed to the animalistic anger of Jake La Motta and how his life outside of boxing is still an extenuation of anger and violence. From the first scene alone, there are connotations of animals in general. We meet a power-hungry young boxer who dreams of being on the big stage, wearing an almost leopard print skin robe, he seeks to be the alpha lion of the ring. The boxing ring itself is almost like an animal pen, chucking two males straight into its depths and culminating in a survival of the fittest. At home, someone even shouts from the streets ""you're an animal!"" to the young champion who is busy dictating his wife on how his steak should be cooked. It's this scene where Jake is depicted as a ruthless animal while his wife is presented as a stereotypical housewife of the 40s, cooking in the kitchen for the man of the house. But saying this, the idea of male dominance and the submissive nature of women seems to be present in a majority of Scorsese's other films such as Goodfellas (1990) as well as The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). In Raging Bull, this male toxication can be seen as a social message, perhaps what not to do as a man? Robert De Niro once again shines during his 4th collaboration with Scorsese and the brilliant ferocity that De Niro brings to the character of Jake la Motta makes you detest and despise him even more.",
564,12 July 2020,rogerslevi,10, Brutal yet Beguiling,It's not your average sports movie it takes a deep dive inside the mind and personal relationship of Jake Lamotta. It at times can be very hard to watch but yet so is the sport and our expectations we have on those who participate. Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese at their best.,
565,12 April 2021,estefaniakuester,10, BEUTUFUL FILM,This film is amazing. This is one of my favorite shot and produced films ever. I do think this is a masterpiece but not perfect. This is a very emotional film. The only thing I don't quite understand is why everyone seems to consider jake a horrible human being and not even thinking about what his brother and wife did to him by cheering. Everyone points the finger on him and yes he is not a great man but his surrounding people are as bad as him. Jake is a very insecure man and is very paranoid with his wife. Overall great film.,

This movie will always stick with me. De Niro gained 60 pounds to play the role of Jake LaMotta and he won a well deserved Best Actor award for his role. But its the not the weight gain or the fighting scenes that won him that award. He won I believe because of the scenes he showed sadness and sorrow, for example the scene in the locker room after he threw the fight and the scene in the jail cell after he was arrested, these are the two most powerful scenes in the movie and they are the reason he won that award its not an opinion its a fact. Thank you for your time.",

Joe Pesci and Cathy were excellent in their roles too... the characterization of Jack as first a flirt with Vickie, then the significance he gives for his sport was told well in the scene before the match were he tries to bed Vickie.. the climax was perfect saying the boxer is beautifully painted in him... and his innocence in the prison cell... were he shouts, ""i ain't so bad"" pass through your heart... in short... a masterpiece from Scorsese and De Niro",
568,23 August 2022,alhambratorso789,6, Boxing film among the best,"Boxing film among the best. Watching itl nearly a quarter of a century after De Niro won his Oscar cannot be the same experience as watching the movie when it was freshly made. The interesting thing is that regardless of when you watch a movie, there would often be another one that it would make you recall. In my case, it's Sylvia which I saw very recently. The link is the emotion called jealousy. Manifested in two real-life characters of the opposite sex, jealousy just jump out of the screen at you in both movies, although strangely, it isn't the main subject matter of either. Strange it may seems, jealousy serving as an immediate link between two human beings that could not have been more different: Jake La Motta and Sylvia Plath,. In the opening credit, against the background music of Ave Maria (Bach-Gounod's version, I think, but could well be wrong), we see in slow motion a blurred figure (presumably De Niro) in a hood, at a distance, practising by himself on the far left side of the screen, in a boxing ring. Regardless of what it is saying, or not saying, the combination of the mystic visual image and serene music produces an uncanningly haunting effect. Moving right alongon the boxing scenes. Someone once said that boxing is the purest form of head-to-head confrontation/combat. The movie industry is prolific with good boxing scenes. (Even Elvis Presley in Kid Galahad is not that bad). The unique thing about the boxing scenes in Raging Bull (and there are so many of them) is that they are closest to documentary footage than what you'll see anywhere else. In Raging Bull, there is little dramatic consequence to them. As are result, they can be filmed in the purest form. Many have commented that these boxing sequences are brilliant, and maybe that's why.",

Set in the days of the old people this film really lacks any action, the boxing scenes are unrealistic, and the blood is fake because its black and white. nothing really happens in this film to entertain the viewer, you would think that being black and white it would have some action to make it more entertaining. but no, none of that. just a boring mess of a film thats shot in black and white. stay away from this, watch Rocky instead.",
