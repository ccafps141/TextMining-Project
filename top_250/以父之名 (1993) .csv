0,6 October 2020,Xstal,8, Guilty Until Proven Innocent...,You're left wondering how many people over the years have been through the legal system in the UK and have been framed by those we place the ultimate trust within. It really does shake your confidence in a system and the people responsible for implementing it. Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite bring this story to life with two magnificent performances and allow you to forgive those slight variations that misalign with actual events.,/

2,2 September 2005,jcanettis,10," Extremeley Powerful, With Superb Performances","A film fully deserving to be in IMDb's top 250, Jim Sheridan's ""In The Name of the Father"" is an excellent piece of work. Based on a true and very touching story, the film recounts the story of Gerry Conlon (Day-Lewis) who is wrongly accused as an IRA terrorist. Not only are the police bending the facts to prove their case, but in the process they also implicate members of his friends and family, including his father Giuseppe (Postlethwaithe) whose health condition is rather frail. Gerry is a rebellious and mildly delinquent boy who does not seem to have grown up, and his attitude toward his father is not the appropriate one; however, as they start to go through the ordeal together, Gerry gradually matures, and starts feeling a deep affection and respect for Giuseppe.",e
3,9 August 2002,Theo Robertson,7, Innocence Is Not An Absolute,"Like MIDNIGHT EXPRESS , IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER is a an extremely well made film , but like MIDNIGHT EXPRESS much of it is total invention . Reviewers on this page have already pointed out the numerous errors such as Guiseppe and Gerry Conlon never being imprisoned in the same jail or the "" Guilford four "" and "" Mcguire seven "" trials taking place in completely seperate court cases but no one seems to have pointed out the erroneous backgrounds this film paints of Gerry Conlon and Paul Hill. In their book THE PROVISIONAL IRA authors Patrick Bishop and Eamon Mallie state the facts quite clearly that Paul Hill was a member of the Belfast brigade of the provisonal IRA ( And Hill later did confess to being a member ) while Conlon had been a member of Na Fianna Eireann which is the youth section of the provisionals though Conlon was quickly kicked out ( Literally ) due to his heavy drinking and drug taking . They didn`t meet on the ferry as shown in the film but Conlon bumped into Hill in Southampton where Hill was staying . What was Hill doing in Southampton ? He was on the run from the IRA who wanted to question him about guns going missing and about the possibility of Hill being an informer , something that is always punishable in IRA ranks with death and prior torture . When Conlon returned to Belfast in December 1974 he did drunkenly mention to IRA acquaintances in pubs that he`d met Hill in England and in order to punish Hill for his suspected crimes against the organisation and to take the heat off their own cells active in Britain at the time it was the IRA themselves who deliberately leaked the false information to the intelligence services about Conlon and Hill being involved in the Guilford bombings , not as the film shows a jealous boyfriend . Hill was also later found guilty of the murder of a former soldier though is never shown in the film and it`s this playing hard and loose with the facts that almost threatens to destroy the film . It could have been worse though , there might have been the suggestion that the bombing could have been a mass suicide ",v

7,1 January 2005,philip_vanderveken,8, Perhaps a bit too black and white but still very impressive.,"Even though this movie seems a bit too black and white from time to time I must say that it still is an impressive piece of cinema. Too black and white because I sometimes had the feeling that they had left out some parts to make it all a lot easier for the viewer. I can't help believing that Conlon and Hill weren't the nicest guys either, but the movie shows them almost as saints (except for the fact that they steal some lead from the roofs, they never really do anything wrong). Does that mean that this movie isn't any good? Certainly not! It still remains very impressive and the idea that injustice in the name of protecting the country should be allowed is awful and so it is good that at least some movie makers aren't afraid to protest against it.",/

That being terrorism often hurts the innocent much more than the declared enemy. In the Name of the Father is a powerful, well-acted drama about terrorism and injustice. And also the love one man feels for his father. Some of the events in this film are factual, and others are not.

His father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite) is a straight-arrow soft-spoken man. He and his friend Paul Hill (John Lynch) are in London staying with hippies. They leave the flat when the pub bombing happens. A prostitute drops her keys and Gerry breaks in. The parliament passes the Prevention of Terrorism Act which allows for suspects to be held for 7 days. Gerry, Paul and others are arrested and coerced into false confessions. Giuseppe and other relatives are also implicated. The actual bomber Joe McAndrew (Don Baker) is arrested and tells the police. However the police refuses to admit its mistake.

Due to an incident with the IRA, Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) moves to London and after a chance opportunity to rob a prostitute he returns to his home in Belfast, coincidentally the day after a huge bombing committed by the IRA in London. His best friend, who was with him that night, Paul Hill is arrested and after being forced to confess with a gun in his mouth he lists Conlon and two other friends as members of the IRA. Now known as the Guildford Four, these innocent people were all sentenced to very lengthy jail sentences and, after painful torture, the government plants false accusations on members of Conlons' family including his father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite). Gerry has to deal with pent-up aggression that he has built up against his father for years while also trying to survive in a British prison as an accused IRA member.",0

19,27 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,9, Very moving and exceptionally well acted,"In the Name of the Father... what a fine movie! This is a movie that really moved me and continues to do so. It has a stirring story, that carries a great dramatic punch, it is beautifully directed by Jim Sheridan and while a little over two hours it never bored me. The script is lovingly balanced, the film looks beautiful and the emotional punch is definitely there. I loved the acting best of all though. Daniel Day Lewis is highly impressive as Conlon, and while I have seen a few reviews saying Emma Thompson was miscast I thought her performance was fine, if anything I would have liked to have seen more of her. For me, Pete Postlethwaite gives the best performance, he is brilliant as the bemused and hapless father, and if there is a film or role he should be remembered for it is this one. Overall, a perhaps controversial but engaging, moving and wonderfully acted movie. 9/10 Bethany Cox",r

Literally I just had to keep watching and gluing to this movie because even though it was years ago, you still want to see Gerry and co being released from jail and live their lives. Unfortunately, Gerry's father wasn't able to experience the freedom with his son and friends as he died in the jail. Very heartbreaking it must have been for the family and like, you just can imagine the effort they put in to try and get everyone out!

26,12 September 2016,miguelneto-74936,8, a film that perfectly depicts the injustice upon Gerry Conlon and his friends.,"In the 70s, an IRA bombing kills five people in a pub Guildford town near London. Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a rebellious young Irishman who ends up being wrongly accused of the crime, and gets life in prison along with three other friends. Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), his father tries to help him, but is condemned too. I always thought the actions of Daniel Day-Lewis better than the own film, more in this film we have a different case, the actions of Daniel Day-Lewis is good as the film in the Name of the Father is a film that portrays a great injustice, the cast is very good, Daniel Day-Lewis in my opinion is his second best performance, losing to Lincoln only Pete Postlethwaite, Emma Thompson, Beatie Edney, Corin Redgrave, Mark Sheppard, etc., the direction is the competent Jim Sheridan, the soundtrack is excellent, the costumes is very good, the pace is good, the more times the pace gets a little slow, in the Name of the Father is one of the best films of the glorious decade of 90, with a great cast and an impeccable performance of Daniel Day-Lewis. Note 8.8",_

It starts in Northern Ireland and moves onto London where Gerry gets involved with another group of itinerants. He is then falsely arrested for the bombing of an English pub by the IRA, where a number of people are killed and maimed. He is sentenced to a long prison term erroneously, along with his father.

28,1 December 2012,eshwarmail,8, Terrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite,"A movie not without its flaws with a biased unidimensional perspective based on the biography by Gerry Conlon one of the accused from Guildford Four. While the overall story is commercialized and worked around for dramatic effect, Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the protagonist's father was too good in some scenes. Though it is competently performed, well written and executed, the battle is already half won with just the knowledge on the premise and the ordeal the Guildford four and Maguire seven have been through in real life.

33,18 August 2017,arturmachado-29588,7, Law is not the same as justice,"Based on the true story of Gerry Conlon who in 1974 was falsely accused of blowing up an IRA bomb in an English pub, being tortured and coerced into signing a confession of a crime he did not commit, resulting in his imprisonment along with his father. Some of his friends and family members were also falsely accused of criminal association and bomb making.",
34,18 September 2006,eddiez61,10, Amazing View of The Troubles,"Totally Surprising. Not at all what I expected from the subject and previews. It could have been a clichéd exploitation of a complicated horrible situation, but rather is exceptionally subtle, nuanced and original, and therefore, very powerful. Some people comment that it plays a little loose with facts, some of which are not so minor. That the film makes no mention of Gerry Conlon's possible, if doubtful, ties to the IRA does change things a bit. Including that info would only have made the film better, more subtle. But its omission does help us to see Gerry Conlon as unjustly accused, tortured and convicted, avoiding the distraction of our suspecting him a criminal terrorist. Daniel Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaithe are riveting as living, breathing, flesh and blood characters, almost bigger and better than the story itself. As a period piece, it recreates the turbulent '70s vividly, while it constantly fascinated me with its British take on the Generation Gap. If you need to remind yourself what great film-making is all about, this is a first choice.",

At some point i understand them, but most of them tried to bring some historical ""facts"" and rumours to damage this movie. There were some others who was trying to catch some mistakes in the movie. The were saying things that doesn't change anything really, for instance: It doesn't really matter where Gerry and Hill met, it doesn't matter if they were at some time in some groups or how they have become the suspects. These things doesn't change the whole idea, but when you sometimes make movies you just have to make some changes. ",
36,19 August 2003,Didier-Becu,8, IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER (DIDIER BECU),"I don't think there is anyone around who can dislike this movie as it's directed in such a magnificent way that there are times you wish every movie could have the same impact even if strange enough director Jim Sheridan never really would make it in the director-scene. This is the story about the Guildford Four, the story of four people who happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Once again London is haunted by an IRA-bomb and as the justice don't want to be blamed another time they must find some ""guilty"" and so it happens that some Irish outsiders are in the area of an exploded pub. The whole family of Conlon (even his father who must be so honest it reaches the laughable) are sent to prison at where they are absolutely hated and getting the hardest regime a prisoner can get. In the meantime the real terrorists are caught but the British government is too proud to convince that they made a mistake and little by little we see people torn apart as they are condemned for something they never did... Let's thank God this was a British production as never Sheridan chooses for Oscar-sentiment, it never goes over the top and it's just given as documentaryinformation, but mind you, the truth itself is shocking enough. Once again splendid performances from Daniel Day Lewis and Pete Postlewaite who plays the role of the father. Superb movie.",
37,23 August 2000,shark7panico,8, very good movie,"Before seeing this movie I thought it was more about the crimes committed by IRA during the ""hot"" period, a sort of documentary. IRA plays indeed an important rule in the events, but the main thing is that this movie is the true story of a family that has been destroyed by the madness of the time, by the need of a scapegoat to pay for all the crimes that were committed. Very well directed. A very famous prison in Dublin, that had an important rules during the independence from England, has been chosen as setting. Watch it, you will be satisfied!",
38,29 December 2010,Hitchcoc,10, Superb Acting and an Outstanding Story,"What is so sad is that while some of the true events were played with, for the most part, this sad episode in British history actually took place. The issue of Northern Ireland has spawned numerous portrayals, some of them outstanding movies. This is about a man who is a bit of a buffoon and a free spirit who acts foolishly (unfortunately, he is unaware that his stupidity would be viewed as it it), and gets into big trouble. Not just going to prison himself but dragging in his entire family. New laws allowed a group of overzealous police to take the rights of a ""free"" people into their own hands. It's a bit like the Homeland Security act today. It was easy to torture, frighten, and taunt people into giving up everything. This included threatening to kill a good friend or even your father. This is a black eye. I never felt the IRA had a right to do what they did, but one can see how their hatred was hatched. Add to this the incredible performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and his cohorts and you have a superb film. See this one.",
39,18 August 2014,panchodh_12,7," A good social critique, but not much more","Don't get me wrong, I really liked this movie. But it's a good movie, not a great one. And I don't even think it has intentions of being it, but rather making a statement on the Northern Ireland conflict, about the UK, and about democratic legal system's as a whole. And above all, it wants to make Gerry Conlon's story reach a wider audience. I seriously cannot believe what happened to him, it's completely outrageous and it really makes you think about the whole idea of Justice, judges, juries, laws, police and so on. Besides the story, which is good (and even better when you keep in the back of your mind that it really happened), the best of this movie is Daniel Day-Lewis' acting. He is probably the best living actor, I'd dare to say. Since it's the earliest movie I've seen of him, I seriously thought that he's actually Irish and that only later he learned to do other accents. Man, he really sounds Irish!",
40,28 May 2009,johnnyboyz,8, Excellent character study of a man wrongfully imprisoned and further forced to balance finding justice with finding solace with his father.,"In the Name of the Father is an epic tale of hope and mistaken identity, a towering achievement of sorts focusing on everyday and very likable central characters as they are put through an awful emotional grinder based on true events from the 1970s and 80s. The film is spoilt only very slightly by a quite woeful theme song from Irish band U2 and the fact director Jim Sheridan cannot much direct action, forcing the very early few scenes to come across as awkward and misjudged. The rest, however, is a dedicated study of a dedicated man forced into becoming a hate figure; a fall guy of sorts, as the British government struggle to come up with answers regarding the ongoing struggles in the conflict with the Irish Republican Army.",

""In the Name of the Father"" shows that this is unfortunately not true. It's the true story of Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis), a rowdy Northern Irishman who got imprisoned by the British government for a crime that he didn't commit. Specifically, they tortured him to the point that he signed a confession. So, he was sent to jail with some other Northern Irish people - including his father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite) - and forced to experience fifteen years of brutality from every angle.",
49,13 November 2017,classicsoncall,8," ""...if there's one thing I know about, it's guilt, you know?""","This is a dramatically moving story on film, but as is so often the case, mincemeat is made of the historical facts so if that's what you're looking for you'll be disappointed. Other reviewers have done a good job of establishing the real relationships involved between Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Paul Hill (John Lynch), so no use belaboring that point. The most disturbing aspect of this film is the idea that authorities won't admit their mistake in a high profile case, even when it means the disruption of families and it's impact on vulnerable citizens like Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), who died in prison serving out a senseless term for a crime he didn't commit. Adding insult to injury, the real terrorists, some of whom admitted their part in the Guildford pub bombing, never even got charged with the crime. It's just so infuriating, especially when you know there's no recourse for the injured parties. With all that, the thing that caused my biggest sit up and take notice moment occurred during the credits following the movie, when it was noted that Paul Hill eventually wound up marrying the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy. He and Courtney Kennedy wed in 2002 and lived in Ireland for four years until they legally separated.",

51,20 June 2010,jboothmillard,7, In the Name of the Father,"From Oscar nominated director Jim Sheridan (My Left Foot), I only discovered while watching what the theme was, but the leading star was the hook for me. Based on the true story, from the autobiographical book by the leading character called ""Proved Innocent"", Gerry Conlon (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Day-Lewis) is a small time crook living in Belfast, Ireland. After a IRA bombing of a pub killing several people in London, where Gerry is, he and four of his friends, and three other men, all named the ""Maguire Seven"" are made to look like, by the bullying police, to have carried out and confess to the crime. Gerry, his father Giuseppe (Oscar nominated Pete Postlethwaite), known IRA member Joe McAndrew (Don Baker) and the other four are falsely imprisoned for a sentence of fifteen years. Knowing their innocence, they are not all keen on prison life, so they start appealing for a case to prove themselves, with the help of compassionate British attorney Gareth Peirce (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Emma Thompson). Trying to help Gerry, who has recently lost his father in the prison cells, Gareth has to get through to the leader of the investigation, Robert Dixon (Corin Redgrave), in order to get a case going.

If one were to put this on a double bill with the Burns doc The Central Park Five, the coincidences would be extraordinary: the rampant torture via police to the accused, the lack of any strong legal defense, and the tampering of evidence. There is that aspect, the US against THEM element, which is simple enough.

59,5 November 2018,RagingDraugr,7," Not great, but good.","In The Name Of The Father is a good movie. Not great, but good. After all, it has a lot going for it: great acting (particularly from its headlining stars: Day-Lewis, Postlethwaite and Thompson), solid and assured direction as well as, obviously, a thought-provoking story about four individuals who were wrongly imprisoned for over 15 years for a crime they did not commit (as well as seven others sent to prison on separate charges). But belying these good aspects, is an over-simplified, poorly-paced and sometimes confusing version of the truth. The story that's being told of the 'Guildford Four' can be perplexing at times, largely because of the pacing and editing of the film. Characters are introduced in some scenes which leave you going ""Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?"", before it clicks much later on in the film who they are and what those scenes were about - and not in a good way. I'm sure a second or third viewing may clear up some of those aspects for me, but it usually doesn't speak well of a film if you're going back to watch it just you can understand what happened fully - rather than re-watching it to try and catch details you missed and/or analyse the film more closely.",

They work very well together. Emma Thompson also get a supporting role as the British lawyer who helps Gerry get out of prison and exonerated for the crimes. The film pulls no punches about the violent persuasion into making a false confession. It breaks your heart to see lies, propaganda, and innocent people going to prison for crimes they didn't commit in the first place but it does happen all the time which is why I am against capital punishment in my country for that reason. The film earned several academy award nominations including for best actor in which Daniel Day Lewis also became a naturalized Irish citizen. He would seem an unlikely candidate for British knighthood like his grandfather now. The film is more relevant today than when it was released. Terrorism has returned with a vengeance. People seem willing to put innocent people behind bars because of their ethnicity. We must learn a valuable lesson in not judging a book by its cover. In the meantime, prison life was not enjoyable but neither torturous. Both Gerry and Giuseppe Conlon are in prison together which makes the situation bearable. In fact the other prisoners are more decent and hospitable than the men who put the innocent men there in the first place. Gerry does honor his father's memory by clearing his injustice.",

Gerry Conlon, accused for being the leader, an innocent, angry young man becomes roommates with his own dad (who got sentenced as an accomplice), and a heartsick relationship evolves behind the bars. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Gerry, and Pete Postlethwaite his father Giuseppe Conlon, and both do extraordinary performances in capturing the relation between the two; the no-good petty thief Gerry sees everything he's demonstrating against in his father, a straightforward and careful elderly man who Gerry insists needs to start fighting back for all the unrighteousness in the world. The film is just as much about this father & son relationship as it is about the political war fought in Ireland, and it mixes those two ingredients masterfully and it makes for an engaging, provocative, tender and emotional experience in which we understand the many difficulties that faced the wrongfully accused convicts.

I first saw this movie some 20+ years ago and I found it to be a long, plodding, go- nowhere film where the outcome was predictable from the start and unraveled so formulaic it could have spewed from the powerbook of the laziest Hollywood hack. It was over-acted at numerous times, some of the conversations were simply not believable (did George Lucas write some of this dialogue?) and there were too many unnecessary close-ups for dramatic effect. Having not read the book (as I was unaware at the time I first viewed it that there was one) and no knowledge of the individuals or events that would comprise the film, the filmmakers needed to do a better job of having viewers care about the characters, their struggles, and their fates.

74,18 March 2014,ironhorse_iv,8," In the Name of the Father, the son, and the Holy Spirit. This was indeed a great movie. Amen for that.","Directed by Jim Sheridan, this biographical film based on the autobiography, 'Proved Innocent: The Story of Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four' by Gerry Conlon. The movie focus on the Gerry Conlon's memoir of his imprisonment in England, for a crime, he didn't commit. In the film, Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a trouble young man who would rather explore free love and dope than get a real job. After Gerry Conlon get in deep trouble in Belfast for stripping lead from roofs of houses and causing a riot with British security forces. Gerry's father, Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), saves him from IRA punishment, by sending off to London to stay with his aunt, for his own good. While, at London, an explosion at a pub in Guildford kills five people (four soldiers and a civilian) and wounds 74, and Gerry Conlon find himself, prime suspect in the crime. Soon the Conlon home is raided by the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary arrest both, Gerry and Giuseppe. After being torture and threated, both agree to sign a confession to a crime, they didn't commit. After years of being mistreat in prison, Gerry finally grew up from bitter son who rails against his father's wishes, to fight for justice for himself, his father and those, whom were wrongly convicted when he discovers who the real perpetrator of the bombing are. With help with Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson), a campaigning lawyer, Gerry try to overturn the falsely convicted of the 1974 IRA's Guildford pub bombings. Will he triumph and gain his freedom or will he fail? Watch it, to find out. Even, so, the film is pretty predictable on the ending outcome, but that's not the main reason, not to watch this movie. You should watch it, to get a true understanding of the thought of being forced to live in a prison like that for seventeen years, accused of a crime, you had no part of. It made my stomach turn and I wept. In the climate of near-hysteria, the Prevention of Terrorism Act was passed, allowing the UK police to interrogate suspects for up to seven days without bringing charges or allowing access to an attorney. Americans like myself should watch it, because a similar Act was passed here, after Sept. 11, 2001. Both acts are not right, and need to review. If this movie doesn't raise your blood pressure over the miscarriage of justice, the arrogance of leadership and the need for each individual to judge according to their conscience and not their prejudices, nothing will. Another reason is because the film really work on being a gripping drama between the relationship of father and son. The movie took some liberties by showing the father/son relationship enhanced by sharing a cell in prison, which they never did in real life. I was immediately drawn into the story by Daniel Day-Lewis' as well, as Pete Postletwaite performances in both legal and personal perspectives. Both are great in this film giving the audience emotional depth. The language is a bit harsh in this movie, lot of cursing, but understanding heavy Irish accents as I do, watching a subtitled edition of this film might be a good idea. Some people might not like this movie due to its over impartially case that Britain misrules Northern Ireland, violates Irish civil rights and knowingly compromises its own legal system. I study a lot about the Troubles between England and Northern Ireland, but I really doubt every Englishman is a corrupt anti-Irish bigot. It might be a bit over exaggeration. Though some minor facts were changed, some the major 'facts' are just not real. Example like the crucial character of Joe McAndrew (Don Baker), an IRA man who might had something to do with the bombings is just a fictional character. Still, what remains as truth is gut wrenching when you think about it. Given the subject matter, the film was still well received in protestant areas of Ireland and in England. The film does shows that English public attitudes turned into a highly supportive for the Conlons' freedom when it started to become clear that they were not the culprits for these atrocities nor does the film make the IRA terrorists look like heroes. It is a bit frustrating that people take what the film tells them as fact, but this doesn't take away from the fact that this is a well made, engaging and quite moving film. Regardless of people's political beliefs or the idea that the film might be a bit political bias. The film is a good movie that never really tip over into slushiness or being over preaching or ranting. The music soundtrack is amazing to hear. I love Bono and Gavin Friday ""In the Name of the Father"". Epic and beautiful. Another great song is 'You Made Me The Thief Of Your Heart"" performed by Sinead O' Connor. Quite inspiring. Overall, I thought this film was fascinating to watch. While the troubles are now over with 1998's Good Friday Agreement. I think the film is still very important to watch in a post-9/11 world because it makes us question our current government's hastiness to find answers and make executive decisions. It makes you wonder if our government is or had jail innocent people. Hands down, a politically and emotionally charged issue such as that, is needed to be question.

Gerry Conlon of Belfast just happens to be in London with friends when a bomb explodes in a pub, killing innocent Britons. Although Conlon is innocent and the police have found a witness who corroborated his story, he is convicted of murder and sent to prison along with his friends and members of his family, considered accessories. Gerry and his father Giuseppe, an Irishman with an Italian first name, portrayed by Pete Postlethwaite, end up in prison together, and much of the film revolves around father-son conflict and eventual reconciliation prior to the father's death, hastened by abusive prison treatment. Eventually, a British lawyer (Emma Thompson) takes up their case and, by luck, discovers a file ""not to be shown to the defense"" which confirms that police found Conlon's witness and had his statement confirming Conlon's alibi. The prisoners are ordered released after 15 years while the police who gave false evidence against them are acquitted. The terrorism committed by the Irish Republican Army was deadly. Mistreatment of suspects by investigators was routine. And violation of the Rule of Law was forgiven by British juries. Unbelievable? Unfortunately not.",

Other reviewers have done a good job of establishing the real relationships involved between Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Paul Hill (John Lynch), so no use belaboring that point. The most disturbing aspect of this film is the idea that authorities won't admit their mistake in a high profile case, even when it means the disruption of families and it's impact on vulnerable citizens like Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), who died in prison serving out a senseless term for a crime he didn't commit. Adding insult to injury, the real terrorists, some of whom admitted their part in the Guildford pub bombing, never even got charged with the crime. It's just so infuriating, especially when you know there's no recourse for the injured parties.

And except for iconic pieces like Star Wars or Jaws one never comprehends the importance of a good score until you've heard a bad one. Originally Chinatown had a different(and inferior) composer and after watching the film Robert Towne told Roman Polanski how his movie was being ruined by the score. Eventually Towne convinced him to change it and Jerry Goldsmith was hired to redo the music. Goldsmith's haunting score is so much of Chinatown's atmosphere and its contribution can hardly be overstated.

From the opening sequences of this film to the amazing direction to the dedicated actors, I knew that In the Name of the Father was going to be more than just your typical political ""courtroom"" drama. It wasn't until the film was finished that I realized Sheridan's power. I speak very highly of him in the opening of this review because I believe that if any other director would have been at the helm of this project that the final cut would not have been as immaculate. Typically with films of this nature we, as audience members, fall prey to there needing to be some sympathy for the opposing country. The British did unfairly treat the Irish in this film, but I believe any other director would have chosen a neutral ground instead of forging headfirst like Sheridan chose to do. I believe any other director would have focused more perversely on the courtroom drama aspect of this film instead of the compelling family epic that was being forged within the walls of Gerry's prison.

However, I can't recall that I have seen a troubled father-son relationship (brought to life by astonishing performances from Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite) has been better depicted than in this. Just look at how the experience of imprisonment somehow matured Gerry up, whether by getting to know his father more and better (the dialogue between Gerry and Giuseppe is just phenomenal), or merely due to the incidents and mishaps that he had in prison. Not to mention the painful and provocative meticulous dramatization of a miscarriage of injustice, vividly portrayed by some of the most sensible, artistic, emotionally-charged scenery that Jim Sheridan's nuanced direction are responsible of.",

92,4 September 2005,MichaelMargetis,7," ""I'm a free man, and I'm walking out the front door!"" - Gerry Conlon","Director Jim Sheridan and actor Daniel Day-Lewis' follow-up to 'My Left Foot' entitled 'In the Name of the Father' may move a little slow but most of the time in succeeds in being both heart-wrenching and inspiring. It's a very political film based on the true story of an small-time Irish hoodlum Gerry Conlon (Day-Lewis), his hippie friends, his relatives and his father being falsely convicted of London/Ireland IRA bombings. The film follows Gerry in prison and his fight to get him and his family out. Daniel Day-Lewis gives an incredible performance, while Pete Postelwaithe who plays his father is amazing in every scene. Emma Thompson is good for her very limited screen time as Gerry's lawyer and you should look out for a bit part played by Oscar Nominee Tom Wilkinson (In the Bedroom) towards the end. 'In the Name of the Father' was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director - Jim Sheridan, Best Actor in a Leading Role - Daniel Day-Lewis, Best Actor in a Supporting Role - Pete Postlewaithe, Best Actress in a Supporting Role - Emma Thompson and Best Adapted Screenplay.

A film about the "" Guildford Four"", four alleged IRA terrorists and their subsequent life imprisonment for the bombing of a pub in Guildford in 1974. My expectations weren't very high as the film began with the usual scenes of the streets of Belfast with its squaddies instigating and squashing the rioting catholics. Cut to a fleeing Daniel Day Lewis to a hippy commune in London, all pretty obvious. Then the bomb, and the English media, police and public baying for blood. Day Lewis is arrested sent down for life.....after confessions are brutalised out of him by the police and evidence falsified to incriminate his father and family they are also found guilty.... for being Irish in the wrong place at the wrong time...then real IRA bomber confesses. Following a long protracted fight for innocence they eventually get pardoned and released. I'm obviously skimming over what is both a wonderful film and a disgusting chapter in British history. Great acting from all concerned. The relationship between the father and son, Day Lewis and Postlewaite excel here. I can't do justice ( no pun intended) to any of the real innocent people involved, both victims of the bombing or the Guildford Four by writing a review of a film.

118,27 March 2023,PartTimeCritic,8, A Parable on How to Respond to Violence - Based on a True Story,"IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER (A-) is the second collaboration between director Jim Sheridan and actor Daniel Day-Lewis and scored seven Academy Award nominations (winning none of them). The film is based on the true story of how Gerry Conlon, his father, and other members of his extended family were wrongly accused, framed, and imprisoned for an IRA bombing in London during the 1970's. Rather than a examine the particulars of the IRA situation, the film uses the story of Gerry Conlon and the injustice done to him by the English government as a parable of vengeance and justice. Yes, the particulars of the story are important to inform and you do walk away with a general sense of what happened in this story, but the film is more pre-occupied with embodying the different responses we can make to injustice: should we just accept it (Gerry Conlon), violently react (Joe McAndrew), or peacefully protest it (Giuseppe Conlon)? Gerry Conlon is one of Daniel Day-Lewis best performances and I'm aware at the stiff competition that is. Daniel Day-Lewis becomes Gerry - an immature, ignorant, and unprincipled young man with no real direction or passions in life. After he's dumb enough to steal roofing metal in Dublin causing an IRA riot his father Giuseppe sends him off to live in London. It's there where he happens to be in the wrong place and time to be framed for an IRA pub bombing. I greatly enjoyed watching Conlon struggle to care in the face of injustice and though his father Giuseppe (who is imprisoned alongside him) starts a peaceful letter campaign, Gerry despairs. There's a wonderful mid-section of the film in prison where the real bomber, Joe McAndrew, winds up and showcases what it looks like to stand up and violently respond to injustice. The lessons Gerry learns here become the heart of the movie and move him to accept his father's (who is now dying) ways. It's not a perfect movie, but it is a moving story of injustice and how our responses can to it can either continue to perpetuate injustice/violence, or can seek to disarm it. Well written, directed, and performed, this is one of the best court/prison films out there.",

I also feel the director pushed too hard for the audience to be sympathetic towards Gerry Conlon and spent more time telling about his torture then on his time trying to secure his freedom. Then the death of his father, Giuseppe you feel as though he didn't care and that the inmates cared more about him then Gerry did.

As father and son Giuseppe and Gerry Conlon, both Pete Postlethwaite and Daniel Day-Lewis give passionate and outstanding performances as they struggle with both their failed relationship and the battle to prove their innocence. Emma Thompson gives a strong performance too as lawyer Gareth Peirce, the woman who has taken up the appeal. All other cast members are impressive. Sheridan presents a highly charged, emotional drama which tells a horrifying tale in what is a black period in Irish and English history that continues even today. While he perhaps could have shown us more of the people's reaction and the feeling of the time, he instead concentrates on the Conlon's plight and their never ending fight for justice. Due credit must also go to Jim Sheridan for keeping what would have to be an incident and an issue that is close to his heart, very evenly balanced, as both sides are portrayed as equally guilty of terrible and unspeakable acts.",

You quickly get into fantasy land. The answer? Stop looking for history in the movies. They are not real - even when 'based on a true story' - whoever's reality that is!

The acting in this movie is what really sold me for it. The story is so sad and heart breaking as well. The fact that this actually happened to Gerry Conlon's family is so sad. They had the prime of their lives taken from them. His daughter went to jail at 17 and came out at 32!! That is so screwed up. They took everything from them, just to blame someone for this crime.

Daniel Lewis small-town-criminal-loser guy is annoying, immature and not very nice. He is not very smart, he is steeling, starts a riot and think it fun, he steels a lot of money from a prostitute.. Not even the hippies like him and his friend, because these Irish criminal guys are a bit to rough. Also , in prison, Levis is arguing like a teenager with his father, most for the sake that his father is ""too weak"". Also, the main character do drugs.

Which is the true cause for a lot of pride fueled hate in the world. And, Daniels character, throughout the beginning of the film, hurt himself, and his father, along with the rest of the people he knew, by simply being selfish and immature. As I said, a real character flaw in a lot of people in the world. He refused to see, that the people, he thought were ""in the right"", would use him too, in the struggle for power. And, while imprisoned, his maturity grew. Sadly at the cost of his father. He saw that it was only about a power struggle from the 2 sides. And, finally realized, his father and him had nothing to do with it. And his father who would fight for his son, and family. Not for the glory of power. But the love of his family. Was truly, the strongest person, around him. Daniel Day, was awesome in this movie, for portraying, a stubborn immature, character, who completely matured, albeit, very late. He discovers what really matters to him the most. But, hey, Thats the evil of pride, for you. It isn't a sin for nothing. ",

It's truly a shame. Yes, the movie is a older now, but it's a classic film about injustice and political oppression. And Dainel Day-Lewis, wow. It's my understanding that he lost out to Tom Hanks for Best Actor, which is unfortunate. Not to take away from Hanks, but because this is an absolutely amazing performance. He shines as Gerry Conlon, a man wrongfully convicted for a brutal crime. This is one of those rare films that allows you to feel the pain of injustice. I'm not Irish. I'm not English, and I wasn't even born when Gerry was convicted, yet I can feel as if I was there. I was in that prison with him with this movie. ",

175,14 April 2011,vannmannen_nina91,8, A great movie that everyone should watch at least one time,"'In the name of the father' is a movie based on a true story. The story is about a young lad and his father that end up in the hands of the IRA-police because they think Gerry Conlon put a bomb in an British pub. Gerry and his pal Danny travel to Gerry's to get a job and get away from the hometown. They find some new friends that are hippies. Their lifestyle gets a little different, but they still follow the law. His father Giuseppe traveled from their family's home in Ireland to England, to help his son. When they both are put in jail the family do all they can to get them out. Gerry aunt is also arrested and gets many years in prison. Gerry is young and handles the prison-life better than his father. Giuseppe gets pneumonia and Gerry helps him rubbing a strong lotion on his chest to open up his airways. After a while Giuseppe dies, and Gerry swears to clear his fathers name. A British lawyer, Gareth Peirce helps Gerry to get his case reopened so that they will get a new chance in court. When the case is reopened many years later, Gerry has read in a tape with his side of the story. This will help him a great deal in the second court round. The genre of the movie is typically drama. Policemen who are bad, people who gets punished for things they didn't do, and the ending of the movie. The fluidity in the film was good and comfortable to watch. The nice editing job made the movie a great deal better than it would have been with a poor editing job. The sound could be better, but all in all the movie was good even though the sound was a little bit shrill. I would give this movie a 5, in a scale from 1-6.",

You feel so much for the characters in this movie that it's almost impossible to forget them. I can't even imagine what they went through being wrongfully imprisoned, and I don't think anyone can. The soundtrack is phenomenal for this movie: I purchased it and it still haunts me when I listen to it. It's a shame that many people don't know about this movie.

181,12 July 2022,svj-69343,5, Good but slightly reductive,"I'm not too sure In the Name of the Father fully deserves its 8.1 on IMDb, or whether it should outrank Sorkin's thematically similar Trial of the Chicago 7. Theo Robertson's review points out several historical inaccuracies (one correction: An appeals court overturned Hill's murder conviction in 1994 as his confession to the crime, which the entire case rested upon, had been forcibly extorted). The effect of these inaccuracies is a slightly skewed, touched up narrative. But given that the film's overwhelming focus is finding and doing justice to the truth, this feels indecorous. INF also transitions too quickly between structurally important moments in the film, which doesn't allow us time to reflect on those events, prevents certain characters (like Gareth) from being fleshed out, and gives the impression of piecemeal.",
