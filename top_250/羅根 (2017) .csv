1,7 May 2018,Tweekums,9," A gritty, more adult Wolverine film","It is 2029 and Logan is getting old and tired. Most of the mutants are long gone although Professor Charles Xavier is still alive; he too is old though and as his mind goes so does the control of his powers. Logan is working as a limo drive in the area near the Mexican border and is approached by a woman asking him to drive her and a young girl, Laura, to North Dakota. It turns out Laura is a mutant with similar powers to Logan; unlike him though she isn't a natural mutation but one of a group of new mutants created in a lab in Mexico City as part of an experiment to create super-soldiers. When the experiment was judged to have failed the children were due to be killed so their carers are trying to get them to safety. Logan is initially unwilling to get involved but eventually ends up heading north with Laura and Xavier. They are pursued by those determined to retrieve Laura; everybody who gets in their way is expendable.",r

3,8 November 2020,mbhgkmsgg,9, A comic book film done right,"Gritty, honest and brutal. Just like a movie about Logan should be. This is by far the best X-Men film as far as I'm concerned. Logan doesn't hold back at all which I absolutely loved. For the most part, there is just an onslaught of awful things happening. And apart from the relationship between Laura and Logan, nothing makes you go 'oh, that was nice'.",v

5,23 February 2017,trublu215,10," If there was ever a comic book movie deemed worthy of perfect, Logan is it.","The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.",e
6,1 March 2017,shawneofthedead,9," A fine, fitting farewell to an iconic character, LOGAN is one of the best superhero movies ever made.","Let's cut to the chase, shall we? In every beat, every frame, every moment, LOGAN feels like the Wolverine movie Hugh Jackman has been waiting (and training) for 17 years to make. Set free of a PG rating, this wildly kinetic film has plenty of gore, action and violence pumping through its veins. But what makes this one of the finest superhero movies ever produced is the big, messy, somewhat broken heart beating at its core. ",w

Well the result is there for all to see, with Logan not only showing itself to be undoubtedly the best Wolverine venture by far, but arguably the best X-Men picture as well. If, as expected (and surely to god it's hoped so), this is the last we see of the grumpy metal clawed superhero, then what a fitting and triumphant bow out it is.",/

15,15 March 2017,tavm,10, Logan is a more than excellent final chapter of the Wolverine saga!,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who had previously seen this several times before. He must have liked this a lot if he agreed to watch it again with me as a first-time viewer. Indeed, this was quite different from many previous Hugh Jackman/Wolverine movies as it's a bit more intense and a little more explicit in language as well. This time, it's a future timeline in which he has to take care of a somewhat sick Charles Xavier (once again, Patrick Stewart) in some desert town while he works as a limo driver. Then a woman asks for his help which he at first refuses before a mysterious little girl appears. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a dramatically compelling narrative with plenty of exciting fight scenes along the way. So on that note, me and my friend highly recommend Logan.",0
16,5 July 2017,SnoopyStyle,8, bloody hardness,It's 2029. Mutants in America have been hunted to almost extinction. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a dying drunk and driving a limo. He is caring for Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who is losing control of his powers and his sanity. Logan is approached by Gabriela for help to care for a little girl named Laura. They're on the run from a corporation which created Laura and other mutant children to be super-soldiers. Its thugs are looking to recapture the escaped subjects.,7
17,30 March 2017,Horst_In_Translation,8, Logan the Personal,"Let me start by saying that ""Logan"" is my first favorite movie from 2017. And let me continue by saying that you should not read this review if you have not seen the film yet as it will be full of spoilers to an extent where the normal message up there is not enough and I would like to put special emphasis on this. Now lets go: James Mangold returns from the 2013 film ""Wolverine"" here and I think he did a really good job as this film never drags despite a runtime of over 2 hours and 15 minutes. It's probably still not my favorite from him (""Walk the Line""), but this should not take away anything from his effort. You will not really see too many familiar faces in this one except Jackman and Stewart. As for Stewart, there is one quote from him about mortality and this is a theme that fits the entire movie. Everybody keeps dying here, the good guys, the bad guys and the longer it goes the more you wonder if Logan will get out of it alive. The wolf has gone gray and he only has two friends left with whom he is arguing all the time. For example what I just said also applies to an innocent family of Black people and the dad is a perfect example of how hate towards the mutants is fueled, even if you cannot blame Jackman's character really for anything that happened to this family. It's all humans causing it with their decisions.",/
18,15 July 2017,kosmasp,8, Re-tiring,"The Wolverine movies did not have much luck. While we got used to Hugh Jackman and his performance will be burned in our heads, the stand-alone movies never really stood out that much. Well that is until Logan came along. And Logan has another member of the X-Men family in it, portrayed by Patrick Stewart in this case. And while Logan/Wolverine does not age, both are retired.",?
19,17 February 2017,bryank-04844,9, 'Logan' is the 'Wolverine' film we've always wanted!,"For decades now, we have been clamoring for a 'Wolverine' film done right. From his first incarnation in Hulk #181 to his own miniseries in comic book form in the 1980's by Frank Miller, to the amazing Saturday Morning Cartoon, and his first appearance in a feature film in 2000 with 'X-Men', which had the song and dance man Hugh Jackman play the iconic character. He was so good at playing Logan/Wolverine, that fans immediately took a liking to him as that character and he went on to play the 'Snikt-y Snikt' character in almost a dozen more films. Besides the 'X-Men' films, Wolverine got his own set of standalone films, which may or may not have been liked by a lot of people for various reasons. Either the story was too silly or the character Wolverine was to PG for fans.",r
20,12 June 2017,templar77099,8, Logan is another level,"The best X-Men film alongside First Class. It felt gritty, it felt real with a sense of dread and hopelessness you don't often see in this comic-book blockbuster adaptations. It should be praised for doing things differently and really pushing the edge with what can or can't be done in the genre. The triangle between Logan, Charles and Laura works as the driving force of the plot, and is very well developed. Logan's character arch is quite pleasant to watch, though obviously predictable. With that said, the acting is clearly masterclass. You can feel the dilemmas, the emotions and feelings that the characters are put through, specially those three. And another thing it does really well is alluding to a previous event - the Charles incident - but never fully explaining it to the audience, leaving you wondering. The action is nothing like you'd expect from a tenthpole - the R rating really makes up for wonders - being quite visceral and impactful. ""Logan"" probably deserved a better villain, although one could argue that the real villain here is not the typical multinational corporation, but the inner demons of the characters. Demons that prevent them from living albeit normal and somewhat stable life.",e

22,4 June 2017,slicedbread117,10, Here's to 17 Years,"Without question, this was Hugh Jackman's movie, from start to finish. No matter how you view it, or who the mantle is passed onto next, Jackman will forever be Wolverine, and this film proves it once and for all. Logan dives deep into the hearts of its viewers, twisting and turning until every emotional string is pulled, and in the end, delivers a superhero film like no other before it; a perfect swan song.",_
23,14 August 2017,silverkelt,8," Solid and entertaining effort, better then the rest of the Wolverine stand alone's.","With a bit more depth and dramatic flair then its predecessors, this is perhaps one of the best three or four superhero movies ever made, however it really could've explored those depths a bit further and flushed them out. While, I appreciate the effort, those giving this movie a ten , seem a bit enthusiastic about the overall scope of this film. ",=
24,30 October 2020,Xstal,7, Short Changed...,"Riven by some cavernous plot shortcomings you feel the characters, having provided such robust, beguiling and generous entertainment in the past perhaps deserved a little bit more circumstantial authenticity as they spiral their way to the final curtain call. The Cornish Caliban was a big ask to accept and take seriously, and I only see the camp and drunk Withnail whenever Richard E. Grant pops up, which makes playing the bad guy a bit more of a challenge in my eyes. Plenty of violence and dismemberment if that floats your boat and a finale that might leave more questions than answers.",t
25,26 July 2017,Leofwine_draca,7, Certainly the best X-Men film out there,"LOGAN is a fitting follow-up to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine series, directed by the returning James Mangold with a difference: this isn't your usual 12-rated superhero film but rather a gritty, adult movie full of profanity and bloodshed. Finally we get to see what Jackman's claws can properly do, and the film's regular violent action sequences are pure spectacle. The story is set decades in the future and sees an old-man Wolverine going on a road trip with a senile Charles Xavier and a mysterious young girl in tow.",t
26,14 January 2019,Hitchcoc,9, Can't Speak as a Fanboy,"I've seen several X-men films already, but I have never been entirely sure of all the baggage and relationships. So as I watched this, I was pleased that the filmmaker assumed not everyone knew the underlying details. This was exciting. It's obvious that the original crew has fallen on hard times. Wolverine is falling apart. His healing ability is pretty much at its end. He has decided to try to withdraw and let life take its course. But, unfortunately, he is confronted by an evil next step by the lineage of the X-men experiments. This is a wild ride as his ""daughter,"" a clone of him, and he try to find other kids who have been changed and bring them to safety. Of course, the bad guys don't want their escapades to get out. I do have to say that I am really getting tired of all the gore and the endless fighting. Still, it was satisfying. It also leaves the doors open for a whole new generation.",_
27,16 March 2017,alva3901,10, A masterfully orchestrated film,"The final outing of Wolverine by Hugh Jackman is one unforgettable ride and one of the best comic-book movies in recent memory. Directed by James Mangold-who was also at the helm of ""The Wolverine"" (2013)- Logan creates a character-driven, violent and emotional film, which benefits from its rated-r rating. The acting, action and story of Logan are one-of-a-kinds in the superhero genre, as the cast, headed by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and newly- introduced Dafne Keen, play their characters to the fullest. It is unlike any other X-Men film, definitely the best in the series and deserves the praise it's getting.",u
28,4 March 2017,Quinoa1984,8, emotionally it gets it so right that one can mostly look over story flaws,"I have to wonder how people will react to Logan even a year from now, much less years from now, when some of the story flaws in this become more apparent. Some of the things in Logan may seem like nitpicking (how does one drive a bullet-ridden limo through Texas into Oklahoma, for example, without anyone noticing until the minute it's pulled up to the hotel to be uh parked), some things may be sort of griping about the logistics of things (i.e. the comic book of X-Men is a plot element in this movie, like the X-Men comics exist, which would be a clever meta moment if it wasn't in the midst of the one of the darkest comic book movies ever made), and there are other beats that just have to do with how quickly (or, really, not) the villains don't catch up with our trio of main characters, Logan, Xavier and Julia, even when they literally have the coordinates to get to them. Not to mention some things in the last third of the movie that make things while not necessarily less violent or intense, a little more standard as a comic book movie, certainly as it's the 10th film in 17 years with an X-Men character from Fox.",r
29,26 May 2017,fung0,4," Shallow, Tedious and Disappointing","The high ratings for this film are based entirely on its sombre tone. That's a great novelty in a 'superhero' movie, to be sure.

30,8 March 2017,srdjan_veljkovic,6," It's different, but that is it's only really good trait","Yes, it's very different from other superhero movies.

31,26 July 2017,Platypuschow,7, Logan: Not the most fitting send off,After countless delays and due to my stupidly swollen watchlist I finally got round to seeing Logan which at time of writing currently sits at #155 on IMDb's Top 250 list.,
32,13 December 2017,nlytnd_1,5," This movie is like watching Wolverine ail around in pain for 2 hours, actually that's exactly what it is!","Nearly everyone I've ever come across unanimously says that this is an overrated movie and I couldn't agree more. 
Approx 95% of the movie is dedicated to Wolverine gimping around like a zombie, wincing in pain. 
Little makes sense, it's just a sloppy movie with little to no logical sequencing.",
33,5 March 2017,Danusha_Goska,1," Violent, Exploitative, Stupid","If you've ever wanted to watch a little girl roll a severed human head over a dusty parking lot, go see ""Logan."" ""Logan"" is a violent, gory, hateful, ugly, senseless and charmless movie. Hugh Jackman stars as Wolverine, aka Logan, a man with retractable claws in his hands. He connects with Laura, a mutant like himself. The girl is trying to escape from mistreatment in Mexico to a safe house in Canada called ""Eden."" She is being pursued by a bad guy, a white man with – you guessed it – a Southern accent. And I bet you already know the bad guy's name – it's Donald. ",
34,4 March 2017,dhxmansarbajna,9, Hugh Jackman's swansong is as beautiful as it gets,"James Mangold's Logan (8.5/10) About forty seconds into the movie, you confront a bloody Logan who isn't able to stand up while puny thugs decide to assault The Wolverine. And somewhere deep inside you feel a little uncomfortable. Probably because all you have seen Hugh Jackman do in the previous nine installments is watch the healing and indestructive Wolverine fend off anything that weakens him with utmost ease. It all fall aparts in Logan, Wolverine's swansong and an enigmatic crossroad of fear, uncertainty and reality. Wolverine is at his most vulnerable self here and yet far more courageous than all the rest of the X Men movies put together. And this is what makes Logan an extremely compelling watch; the chance and ability to finally empathize with a 'superhero' in a much finer sense and to witness whether they possess the same fortitude once their 'gift' has been taken away from them. Logan, set in 2029, narrates the endeavour of Wolverine, as he drives through the rocky, dusty terrains of El Paso with Laura, a mutant, blessed (with the same powers that he has) who needs to be sent somewhere safe. Along with her is a rugged, dying and somber Charles Xavier who wants to make sure that Logan is true to his word. Donald Pierce (played adequately by Boyd Hollbrook) is a raging current who needs the mutant and spreads considerable blood without any account of collateral damage. The repeated encounters take a toll on Logan's already dying self and even if he doesn't show it, over the course of time, he starts developing a bonding with Laura. He finds within her, the same embodiment of rage that turns people into monsters and sees Laura waging off the inevitable with a silent grace. The relationship which Laura and Logan share has several layers to it and can be interpreted in a much wider canvas. That's for another day. The influence of nineties western classics on the Logan is clear and critical. The homage is directly linked when Charles watches scenes from the 1953 classic Shane, and the lines are repeated again in a final scene. The dust symbolizes the ruins the mutant have brought upon themselves in their ideology of helping mankind marking their own destruction. Patrick Stewart is remarkable as a Xavier who is on the brink of death, set upon the call of epileptic seizures that capsize the lives of anyone near him and there is nothing he could do about it. All Xavier wanted his whole life was to stop people from getting hurt, and in his final moments he cannot stop himself from hurting people. This irony is a powerful strike to the entire genre which relies heavily on willing suspension of disbelief. Everything dies in the end, it's all about the manner in which it is achieved. Mortals, superheroes, they all do. Hugh Jackman could have become a lot of other things, a fine actor, if his brooded look would not have been entirely associated with Wolverine his entire life. And even if he strutted and limped along the way, in Logan he delivers his finest performance. Period. Every scene is a rave emotional experience and comes with a satisfaction of being content if not necessarily happy. He is in pain and so are we, and the audience agrees to be a part of it sailing across in the journey. Logan becomes an imperative movie in changing the face of the superhero genre. The need and allowance of superheroes to be vulnerable and uncertain instead of omnipotent and sarcastic is something I'd been wishing for a while. In Logan, James Mangold manages to capture every element which thrives on the edge of this conflict and the swansong he creates, becomes a painting. It is a magnum opus, a bloody opera and a massacred theatre room with audiences still lying out for view. And yet, it is beautiful.",
35,13 August 2017,Mike_Devine,8," A worthy, respectable finale to a storied franchise","Marvel's 'X-Men' universe has come a long way since its debut on the silver screen back in 2000. 17 years later, audiences get to experience 'Logan,' the final chapter in the franchise as we know it.",
36,9 March 2017,supermaggie,3, Not a worthy X-Men/Wolverine ending but a vulgar display of brutality,"I couldn't agree less with the positive reviews. This is not a realistic movie instead of a superhero movie (if you don't like superhero movies/movies based on comics - why watch X-Men/Wolverine at all? If you are so into ""realistic"" violence, go watch Hostel and other such abominations), this movie is just wrong. There is a reason that Mad Max movies are Mad Max movies and X-Men movies are X-Men movies and that Mad Max fans like Mad Max movies and X-Men fans like X-Men movies, and there may be an overlap between these two groups but I honestly doubt that these people understand the movies then since both series have a very different angle. And if you are into obscene, decadent, depraved madness and violence, feel happy to watch the disgusting Mad Max stuff and fry your brain. If you are into cool, creative, entertaining, positive, smart action and fun, you were being served right with the X-Men movies so far. This last Wolverine movie being a disappointing exception, reveling in blood and madness, without any coolness (and I do not mean / mind that Logan is older and weaker, that's absolutely fine with me) but dirt and vulgarity instead. The stupid girl doesn't make it any better, and the ending - well, actually, after watching this torture-like installment, I do not even mind the ending anymore this much, since if this are the sequels we could have expected, I prefer it to end. Would have never thought I would ever say this: not a good/worthy ending, but at least an end. If this is what people want to see, and if this is how the so far interesting X-Men series is meant to end, I can only confirm once more that people are crazy, primitive and all together completely different from me. I don't need such a vulgar display of brutality, neither do I enjoy it or give it a high rating. TWD is over since it lost its focus and Wolverine can now be buried, too, in any respect.",
37,26 April 2020,juneebuggy,4, Depressing,"This was a grind to get through, just a sad story about the end of some great characters lives. Logan is living in a hideout near the U.S Mexico border caring for the ailing professor X and working as a chauffeur. He is angry, mean, exhausted, addicted to pills and alcohol, his body is failing and he's just fed up with the world. Patrick Stewart as X is now a bumbling useless old man, on drugs to control his ""spells.""

38,6 October 2018,MLDinTN,3, an unnecessary movie,"This movie has nothing to do with X-men besides the names of 2 characters, Logan and the Professor, Charles. There is no humor and it is excessively violent. And it is just plain boring. Logan is aging and keeping the Professor safe. Then some how this woman whose escaped from Mexico with a mutant child that was made by the government finds him and wants him to take the girl , Laura.

39,27 June 2017,Aaron1375,9, Hugh Jackman in his last go around as Wolverine,"I missed this film when it was in theaters. That is probably for the best, not that I had any desire to see it then due to the fact my fiancé had just recently passed away. If I had seen it, it probably would have triggered an attack. It still did, but at least I was in my own home so no one could see me break down. Just anything like this makes me remember the love of my life and the tears just pour out and I end up having an attack and have trouble breathing. That being said, this was a very good movie and a nice way to send off Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Sure, there are things that make me question what has happened to reduce everyone to the state they are in, but when one reads comics, one understands that the story being presented may be sort of an alternate universe story arc, rather than the main one. I say this is the case with this movie, things may not necessarily turn out the way they did in this film, just in this universe things seemed to have gone very badly. It is a way to change up the actor playing Wolverine and get some closure for the X-men films starring him and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier.",
40,8 March 2017,ReelLifeReviews,4, A let down,"Logan - Touted as a sci-fi western, it definitely lived up to the moniker. Far-reaching deserts and a minimalist score really set the stage. James Mangold wrote and directed it, but I wish he had put down the pen. Each scene is thoughtfully shot, but it's the story within those shots that left me wanting. The positives for me, beyond the ambiance, were two standout performances by under the radar actors. Stephen Merchant, who is usually in English sitcoms, went way off type with his character. Given his past roles I thought it was an odd casting choice at best, but now I couldn't picture anyone else doing what he did. The other was Boyd Holbrook, who played the main antagonist. The subtle choices he made in line delivery and how he carried himself made him a magnetic presence on screen. The film was much more engaging while they were involved in a scene. And then there are the negatives...As I alluded to earlier, the story was just not there. There's weak motivation throughout for both Wolverine and the villains. The movie creates its own plot holes unnecessarily and leans on tropes and off screen happenings to propel it along. The action scenes are an exercise in redundancy. Slash this guy, stab that guy, try stabbing and slashing this person, now mix it up a bit and slash THEN stab this guy. Once you see the first fight you'll have seen them all. And finally there are the inconsistencies with the special effects. They could create extremely detailed battle damage, but couldn't remove the prominent scar on the forehead of the self- healing girl. They could green screen prosthetic arms for multiple characters, but couldn't remove the reflection of the camera in peoples' sunglasses. These, and other details, while minor, added up quickly. Suffice it to say, this western did anything but ride off into the sunset. 4.5/10.",

42,25 July 2017,daddyxj-1,10, What Happens When Superheros Get Old.,"What happens when superheroes get old is the main and interesting question this movie answers. It's a question when you think of when you place superheroes in the real world. Logan is a great movie and I think one of the best superhero movies ever made. The movie so adult in its approach that I think even youngsters who read the comics will learn to grow into. The script, the action, the acting is all great and goes to show that you don't need over the top action and effects to tell a great story. This movie gave me what I wanted...a movie. Something you can watch, be taken away and talk about hours after you watch it. And you don't have to know anything about the mythology of the Xmen to enjoy this film.This movie has heart and is directed wonderfully by James Mangold. Hugh Jackman's final performance as Wolverine is his best performance to date because of the range of emotions he has to go through in this film. Great film, highly recommended.",

44,18 March 2017,zardoz-13,9, Marvelous Marvel Masterpiece!!!,"Twentieth Century Fox has brought the curtain down on its original ""X-Men"" franchise with the ""Wolverine"" spin-off ""Logan,"" co-starring Hugh Jackson and Patrick Stewart. ""Wolverine"" writer & director James Mangold's abrasive, slam-bang, but valedictory entry doesn't resemble the usual, optimistic, hyperbolic, Marvel spectacle with a vibrant ending. Mangold and scenarists Scott Frank of ""The Wolverine"" and Michael Green of ""Green Lantern"" have formulated an often violent, profane saga set twelve years into the future. Jackman and Stewart claim this movie marks the last time they will portray Wolverine and Professor Xavier. Unlike earlier franchise entries, ""Logan"" arrives with an R-rating for its ""strong brutal violence and language throughout, and for brief nudity."" Saying that ""Logan"" sheds the kid gloves that previous ""X-Men""/ ""Wolverine"" movies wore amounts to an understatement. The ""Kids in the Mind"" website, for example, counted as many as 53 F-words and its derivatives, 24 scatological expressions, 9 anatomical names, and 6 minor obscenities. Although enough blood & gore flows for a half-dozen movies, the ferocity of watching various characters getting viciously battered as well as slashed and gouged constantly, usually with multiple blades skewering heads should keep squeamish audiences screaming and gorehounds drooling. ""Logan"" doesn't confine its murderous mayhem strictly to its valiant heroes and slimy villains. This anything-goes opus slaughters innocent bystanders with relative indifference.

Acting :⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Everyone in this film was giving another level of performance that we weren't used to from the very same characters. Hugh Jackman did the best performance as Logan in his 17 year long performance and his best performance since his Oscar-nominated performance. The amount of pain and suffer that Logan and Charles went through over the years was expressed by Hugh and Sir. Patrick were priceless and their expressions could deliver a flow of mixed emotions that would hit every X-Men fan right in the heart.
Making her debut as X-23, the wonderful child Dafne Keen gave one of the most strong child performances ever that blow our mind and we wouldn't ask for a better representation for this character.
Score : ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
By Marco Beltrami (who is also the composer of A Quiet place I and II) gave an intense, thrilling and powerful score that added to the greatness of each scene that will make you on the edge of the seat most of the time. The kind of soundtrack that gives you chills.
Cinematography : ⭐⭐⭐⭐½
By John Mathieson (who is also the cinematographer of Gladiator) was brilliant!! It makes you feel like you are right in the action especially the cars chasing scenes and the camera movements during it. Also the wide shots ( as in photo no. 4) was artistic as it could be. The lightning at some shots was just perfect making the shots at some points as a beautiful painting. The only flaw it had was the decision to shoot some fight scenes (especially the last one) in a single shot to emphasize the brutality and violence in them which the CGI didn't help in.
VFX : ⭐⭐⭐⭐
The visual effects were great but had obvious flops at critical points of the movie especially the last fight scene which was the grand finale of the whole movie which only the brutality, excitement and shock could save.
The plot : ⭐⭐⭐⭐½
The story is for sure strong and unique from the other X-Men films and the best among them. It's only enough that it introduced us to a new aspect of the whole X-Men universe and it's quite shocking and powerful events that just won't let you move your eyes of the screen, but it was quite predictable for how it's going to end and sometimes brought exaggerated violence which was at points unnecessary to keep us attracted.
Direction : ⭐⭐⭐⭐½
By the one and only James Mangold, who saved this franchise after the huge flop and disappointment the 1st film gave us. He made us worry whether this film is going to give Wolverine the ending he deserves or not especially that the 2nd film had mixed reactions but he did give us just the movie we were hoping for and even exceeded our expectations at certain points. Every shot of this film is well studied and artistic as it could possibly be creating the great atmosphere and the beauty that comes out of this brutal world making it an immortal film and one of the all time great. A great Job indeed.
A movie that will make you excited, entertained, cry and smile. One hell of a journey it has been.

Slooow to kick off, lots of repetitive violence of the same kind, little emotional attachment to any character (especially the girl, who spends most of her time either doing bugger all or making holes in people's heads, shoulders, knees and toes), a plot so compromised Logan himself couldn't make any more holes in it with his pointy bits.

Dafne Keen was the true find as she did an outstanding job as Laura (X-23). Not speaking for most of the film means she had to rely on facial expression and looks and she did them with a lot of skill. Whether it was her or just great direction, the point is that she executes her role wonderfully. She has very expressive eyes and at times reminded me of a very young Sandra Bullock.

Directed by James Mangold & set in the near-future, the film follows a past-his-prime James ""Logan"" Howlett AKA Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) embarking on a road trip across America with his diminished mentor/friend, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) for one final mission to safety delivered, a young mutant girl, Laura Kinney (Dafne Keen) to the protection of the Great White North, Canada; while a group of scientists, and their security team led by Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) tries to stop them. Without spoiling the movie, too much, director James Mangold and his writers does an OK job, helming this piece in the style of comics, 'Old Man Logan' & 'the New Mutants'. I just wish, he didn't his characters bash the comics, in-universe so much. What's wrong with having Wolverine, wear his iconic yellow suit!? Fans like myself, really do want to see it. It's sad that Hugh Jackman, will never done that suit. It could had made this film, so much better. Also, if this comic book plot sounds very familiar, it's pretty much, is; as the movie and comics, borrow elements from classic westerns such as 1953's 'Shane', 1972's 'The Cowboys' & 1976's 'The Shootist'; as well as story elements from other dystopian mediums hits like author, P. D. James 1992 'Children of Men' novel; which in return, became a movie in 2006; as well as 2013's survival horror video game 'The Last of Us'. All of this, been cited as one of its story's primary influences, even if the film loosely use all of them. Because of that, it kinda diminished the story, a bit, as 'Logan' is place in a future that's not quite post-apocalyptic as 2014's film 'Days of Future Past' timeline, but not quite as normal. So, it was not as intense as it should be. The film also became a bit confusing at times, as parts of the film talks about events like the Liberty Island accident in the original timeline, when technically, they're living in the revised timeline, set for them. It's really doesn't make any lick of sense. It's all f*** up! When, you think about it, 'Logan' has a lot of plot-holes that goes unexplained like Transigen killing mutants, yet, trying to create them. Don't get, where they were going with that. Also, the question who was in Canada, kinda bug me. Maybe, it's the Alpha Flight? Who knows!? The film never tells you. Because of this, the lack of exposition is pretty noticeable, toward the third act. It will leave you, puzzling, yet somewhat confused. Also, whenever, they do spill exposition about what is happening, it's told in the most laziness fashion like the well-made video on the smart phone. Like honestly, who had time to shot the video, and edited it, when it's supposedly smuggle out, quickly!? Also, why didn't Gabriella (Elizabeth Rodriguez) just publicize it to the public? That would save time. Another problem for the movie for me, was when they unearth the new villain, X-24. In my opinion, I found the surprised villain to be, jarring and yet, also disappointing. It felt a self-jerk. It was just as awkward as 'Albert' from the comics. It just doesn't mesh for me. The film could had been better, if it had Donald Pierce take that role, since Boyd Holbrook was surprising, pretty good, as the extreme fanboy villain. If not, Donald Pierce. They should had use the character of 'Sabretooth' from 2009's 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. Actor, Liev Schreiber was one of the best thing about that movie, as Victor Creed. So use him, instead! Despite the scenes with X-24, the rest of the action was alright in this film, even if it's not as bloody or gory as people make it, out to be. Just glad, it's not CGI heavy. I also like how Hugh Jackman still had the chops to do, most of his stunts. It's also cool to see, a young actress like Dafne Keen, be able to stand out on her own, in those fighting sequences as well. I just wish, the movie establish, more of a father/daughter relationship with the two, besides the fighting. I found those driving scenes part, to be below standards, due to the lack of dialogue and interaction between them. Don't get me wrong, I like Hugh Jackman's performance in this film, but couldn't they had him, lighten up for a few moments. I don't like, how much Logan is a sourpuss. Let the movie had some more fun with him. The film is dark and downer enough. Have some scenes with him, bonding with his kid. For the most part, I enjoy the connection that Logan had with Charles Xavier, more. It seems like they had more of a relationship than Laura and Logan. I found Patrick Stewart's acting to be the best, throughout this film. He really it, took some risk, like losing 21 pounds to look more elderly and ill. That's really intense. He really gives, something new, here, as the sometimes tragic, sometimes hilarious, mentally deteriorating mentor-figure. You've never this side of him, before. It's sad that this will be his last role as Professor Xavier, as well. Overall: I thought the film was well-made. I have to say, this movie was just decent enough to be, a good finale for Hugh Jackman's run with the character. It's good, but it's not quite cutting edge great.",

Unlike the effective - in (X-Men director) Brian Singer's paraphrased words ""I would want my favorite comic book universe, if made into a movie, to be taken seriously"" - other X-Men movies, this movie is filled with gratuitous violence, bizarre levels of cursing and a one-dimensional villain. I can't even remember the villain's name, that is how forgettable he was. Unlike Magneto or Colonel Striker, who were instantly memorable. We are told the movie takes place in the year 2029, but that makes no sense, since they keep repeating there have been no new mutants born in 25 years. Since 2004. But Prof. X's school was - I quote - taking place in the ""not too distant future"" - and was filled with kids in all the prior movies!!! Which were clearly taking place during, before and after 25 years ago, by any clear judgment. It made no sense. We were informed that Prof. X and Logan were among the last alive, that all the other X-Men from the newly resurrected Jean Grey to Scott. But with no explanation, they are all now dead. The entire pantheon of the X-Men, dead, when in the last movie with them - Days Of Future Past - they were all at the top of their game. We never found out what happened to Rogue - who was alive - or Bobby or even flipping Beast! And for some bizarre, entirely inexplicable reason, in this movie the mighty Wolverine is trying to get by ... as a chauffeur. With a chauffeur's permit and everything. IMPLAUSIBLE, MUCH?

No words can describe how good and how beautiful that send off was to both Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier. Thank you for making this beautiful film. As this WAS in fact the LAST X-Men film except Deadpool.

160,4 March 2017,Screen_Blitz,9," Gritty, visceral, and emotionally stunning, Logan is an astonishing superhero entry that really packs the punch","Since the inaugaration of the X-men franchise back in 2000, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine has always stood as a compelling force to be reckoned with in the superhero. He is not firmly your average superhero, he is a hero with true grit and compulsion. Over the years, Wolverine has evolved into a powerful character aching with tragedy and sorrow similar to Batman from the DC universe. Although the iron-claw-wielding mutant has had more than his fair share of time to shine as a visceral cinematic figure, the X-Men franchise has never exercised his true, but gritty spirit to the fullest extent like Christopher Nolan did with Batman in the 'Dark Knight' trilogy...until now. Diving deep into the heart of the titular hero, this film journeys far into the grittier territory of the X-Men universe with a story tackling on complex themes of morality and sorrow that's plagued the inner being of the lead hero. And returning to the director's chair is James Mangold who last directed 2013's 'Wolverine'. Set in 2029, almost the entire mutant race has been wiped and one of the last remaining of the kind is Logan (played by Hugh Jackman). Retired from his glory days, Logan is now living in isolation caring for a dying 90-year old Charles Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart). When he's unexpectedly introduced to a young Latina girl named Laura (played by Dafne Keen) who happens to carry the same claw-wielding powers as him, he and Xavier must escort to safety. Pursuing after them are sadistic forces lead by half-human, half-robot Donald Pierce (played by Boyd Holbrook) who is set out to kill the young girl.",

The comic book was great but I can't say the same for Logan. Many people say they love this movie and the dark rated R format really captures the true essence of the wolverine character which I agree with but as a movie, I just hated it. ",

It is sort of like the concept of the chase where the anticipation of the movie is actually much better than the movie itself, especially when the teaser trailers give you enough to make you really want to see it, but not too much to the point where you basically have worked out the plot and only end up seeing the film because you have seen all the others in the franchise (as is the case with the latest Fast and Furious movie).",

172,3 March 2017,RLTerry1,10, Uncanny!,"Uncanny! 20th Century Fox, Marvel, and TSG Entertainment's Logan is a compelling, grizzly, organic superhero movie that is the last to feature Hugh Jackman as Logan (Wolverine) and Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier. Prepare to have your mind blown as the action unfolds in such a way that your heart will be pounding, racing, and pumping adrenaline through your body and then tug at your heartstrings as emotions run high. Logan is quite possibly the most comprehensive and diegetically dynamic superhero movie ever, and perhaps best X-Men film in the long, successful franchise. With a penchant for thrilling, action, and even horror films, director James Mangold pulls out all the stops in the last chapter in the story of The Wolverine. While there have been several films about Logan/Wolvervine outside of the main X-Men films, this cinematic adventure will have you on the edge of your seat with anxiety and holding back tears simultaneously. Some of the responsibilities of the final chapter of a character or an actor portraying a long-standing character are striking a delicate balance between nostalgia, closure, but still providing audiences with a new story; overwhelmingly, this film delivers the absolute best as we bid farewell to Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart from the X-Men universe and exceeds any and all expectations.",

175,22 March 2017,NothingSacred_com,5, Sad slasher-porn ending to a good franchise,"Hugh Jackman and Sir Patrick Stewart alone are responsible for the few good moments in this sadistically bloody slasher epic, which details the death of the X-man Wolverine in some alternate future in 2029. At a recent screening at The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, director James Mangold rambled on and on about his love of cowboy films and the classic SHANE in particular. Sir Patrick Stewart, who was also there, and who was treated rather shabbily by said director, revealed that the amusing dialogue between his character and Jackman's Logan was entirely ad-libbed. Thus we can credit Scott Frank and Mangold only with one tedious slashing/shooting death after another, all bereft of explanation, logic, or a coherent plot. Cyborg killers in Mad Max-style vehicles? No explanation. Mutant Caliban who can't go in the sun? No explanation or back story at all. Lack of all law enforcement? no explanation. The writers don't care.

While some of that comes down to a neat design, the character of feels the roughest of personalities.

189,15 March 2017,Gresh854,6," Logan Is A Dramatic Action Masterpiece, Not Just Another Superhero Entry","Back in 2016 a special film called Deadpool came out and wowed audiences due to its overall success, considering it was Rated R. I just need to take a moment and thank Deadpool for existing because if Deadpool didn't exist then Logan most likely would've never been made the way it was. Logan to me is a very special film. The hugest praise I can give this film is that it doesn't feel like a comic book superhero movie. Don't get me wrong I love comic book superhero movies, but we're at a time where some of these comic book movies are getting tiring and too familiar. Logan to me is secretly an extremely emotional and serious drama with bits of exceptional action. It is so nice to finally get an extremely dark and serious comic book movie, that treats it's overall product masterfully. Now I don't think Logan by any means, is a perfect film. I have now seen the film twice, opening night and a week after, and I do have to conclude factually, that it has a couple of knit-picky flaws. For the most part though, I think all these insignificant flaws are outweighed by all the positives in this film for sure. In conclusion, the two viewings of Logan have officially confirmed to me that this movie might just be my favorite Marvel film. Hugh Jackman's performance in Logan, is by far his best portrayal as Wolverine. It's quite intriguing to learn about and get behind the character as an older and weaker person. Patrick Stewart's performance as Charles Xavier also, is by far his best portrayal to the character. The new young actress in the film who plays Laura, Dafne Keen, was incredibly good in this film. Normally I get nervous when kid actors or actresses play huge roles in films because, typically they're never really good, but Dafne Keen's commitment to Laura's character is outstanding. These three characters are so grounded and so well developed, through the entirety of the film, to the point where it feels real. A lot of people have been calling Logan, ""The Dark Knight"" of the Marvel entries, and it most definitely deserves the title, because its by far the most realistic and serious Marvel film yet, and has some near Oscar-worthy performances. The only flaw I due have with this film is one character in particular played by Boyd Holbrook, who is a great Actor; I loved his work in Narcos. He plays the main villain in this film, and for me he came off as a little too over the top and cliché. For one, since his character acts sometimes silly in a couple of scenes, it kind of takes you out of the all-so realistic world the film Logan has developed. His character also takes kind of that MCU villain route, where the villain is always trying to be funny like Loki, and I didn't buy it too much in a couple of scenes with him. With that being said, his character wasn't terrible or anything, I just think he could've been improved upon. I think that just might be my only solid flaw with Logan. Everything else in this film works so well, and is crafted with such care and commitment. Now, the action in the film is freakin' crazy. It is all-over-the-place gore splats, slicing people, bodies flying everywhere violent. From a X-Men standpoint its probably the best action that has ever been done in an X-Men film so far. The choreography for every actors and actresses fight scenes where done professionally. I was worried that the character Laura's action scenes in the film would look fake, since she is a little girl doing action scenes. To my surprise it all looked significantly real, which is to be praised for. This review is spoiler-free and I can't get too into details about the synopsis of the film but all you really need to know is that, going into this film, expect a satisfying, action, drama. Don't go into this film expecting another Days of Future Past, or a Civil War, or even a Dark Knight-like film. because Logan is able to stand on its own so well just like Deadpool was able to do. Like I said, Logan is my favorite Marvel movie ever made so far, and I'm going to give it a grade letter of an ""A"" and a IMDb score of a 10/10.",
190,18 April 2017,phoenixinvictus,3, If it's not a superhero movie then don't put superheroes in it,"I found this movie to be disappointing, boring and confusing. If it's not a superhero movie then don't put superheroes in it. There is barely any action in the movie and the whole second act is dull. Logan takes place in the year 2029, with technology that is barely more advanced than our 2017, there's an evil corporation complete with henchmen and they want to weaponize mutating kids to create killers. What a surprise! For some unexplained reason Canada is a magical land with a magical border that is able to repel bad guys and evil corporations. Maybe they have mutated Mounties guarding them In almost every X-Man movie the technology is always super advanced, with invisible planes, flying robots and holographic simulators, but all that technology seems to have vanished along with all the mutants. After having lived for over a century we finally see Logan is not only is ageing, but also dying. The movie never really explains why he no longer is able to regenerate except for a hint that the adamantium is somehow poisoning him. We also never get a reasonable explanation of what happened in ""Westchester"" other than that Xavier may have killed everyone with one of his seizures and who now has a mental illness. Wasn't there any signs of Xavier's illness? People with mental illnesses don't just snap from one moment to the next. Couldn't they have given him an injection of some sort like they did in another movie? This movie glossed over twenty years of back stories that wants to make me want to shake my head. Maybe they'll time travel their problems away in a reboot where things aren't so confusing. The plot holes are abundant and so I rate this movie with a capital B for Boring.",

'Logan (2017)' is brutal, sombre, visceral, heart-breaking, nuanced, tragic and, overall, an amazingly accomplished piece of work in every possible way. It's the culmination of all that came before, the true incarnation of this classic character, and a masterful deconstruction of the superhero genre.

194,8 March 2017,jboothmillard,7, Logan,"It was massive news when it was announced that the leading actor was stepping down from the role of Wolverine, after seventeen years, this was his final outing, it was just a question of what would happen to the character, directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma, The Wolverine). Basically it is the year 2029, mutants are on the brink of extinction, James ""Logan"" Howlett, formerly Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), is ageing and weakened, the adamantium fused to his body is poisoning him, meaning his healing capabilities are dwindling, he has turned to alcohol, and he works as a chauffeur. Logan is living in an abandoned smelting plant across the border in Mexico, along with albino mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant), there they are caring for Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who is suffering from a neurodegenerative disease, causing devastating effects to his telepathic abilities. Logan is approached by Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez), a nurse for biotechnology corporation Transigen, she wants him to escort her and an eleven-year-old girl, Laura (Dafne Keen), to a place called ""Eden"", in North Dakota. Logan is also approached by Transigen's cybernetically-enhanced chief of security, Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), he turns down his offer of a job to find Gabriela and Laura for him. Logan reluctantly accepts the job for Gabriela, but he discovers she has been murdered, Pierce and his cybernetically- enhanced enforcers, the Reavers, try to kill Logan and Laura, they and Charles narrowly escape the killers, but Caliban is captured and tortured into using his capabilities to track them. Logan and Charles watch a video on Gabriela's phone, they learn that Transigen was breeding mutant children with DNA samples from several mutants for the ""X-23"" project, but as they grew up they became difficult to control, upon completion the children were deemed unnecessary and were to be killed, Gabriela helped several children escape and smuggled Laura across the border, furthermore, Laura is Logan's daughter, bred from his DNA. Laura has brought a X-Men comic, Logan finds this while they stay in Oklahoma City, in it Eden is referenced, he comes to believe Eden does not exist, the Reavers locate them, but Charles has another seizure and freezes everyone in the hotel with a psychic blast, this allows Logan to kill the enemy, but hundreds have been left injured and dozens dead, Logan injects Charles with a suppressant before they leave. A local family, the Munsons, give the trio shelter, after they help round up their horses on the highway, during the evening Charles expresses his guilt about the past, where he has a seizure that injured and kills an unknown number of people, including some X-Men. Charles thinks he is talking to Logan, it is in fact a feral Wolverine clone, X-24, that has no healing abilities and a weaker adamantium skeleton, the clone stabs Charles and slaughters the Munson family wife Kathryn (Scream 2's Elise Neal) and son Nate (Quincy Fouse), then captures Laura, Logan returns after the devastation, the injured Charles dies shortly after. Caliban sacrifices himself, destroying the van he is in with two grenades, allowing Logan and Laura to escape, Logan and X-24 clash, until the clone is impaled and shot in the head by Munson father Will (One Hour Photo's Eriq La Salle), before he dies, allowing Logan and Laura to escape. After burying Charles, Logan is rescued from a clinic by Laura, after a doctor attempts to convince him he can help his condition, Laura convinces him to let her drive them Eden, meanwhile X-24 is given a serum to regenerate by his creator Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant), the head of Transigen. Logan and Laura find Eden, a safe haven for the escaped Transigen test subjects, run by mutant Rictor (Jason Genao), the children are planning to journey across the forest to the Canadian border, where there people who can help them, Logan wants to leave Laura with them, he worries his presence will endanger them. However the Reavers ambush the children in the forest, Logan uses a serum Rictor gave him to restore his healing factor, he slaughters many Reavers before the serum effects wear off. Rice confronts Logan, he reveals the destruction of mutantkind was is due to a virus created by Transigen, made to control the mutant population and weaponise them, he also mentions that Logan killed his father, Logan shoots Rice dead, and Pierce release X-24 on him. The children wipe out the remaining Reavers and kill Pierce, Logan and Laura fight X-24, Rictor uses his seismic powers in attempt to aid Logan, but caught off-guard he is impaled on a tree stump, Laura is able to kill X-24 with an adamantium bullet to the head. Fatally wounded, Logan acknowledges Laura as his daughter, he tells her not to be the weapon she was made to be, before he dies in her arms, the children mourn his death, and bury him in the woods, Laura tearfully adjusts the cross on his grave, to create an ""X"", she and the children continue their journey to cross the border and find a new beginning. Jackman has played Wolverine since the first X-Men in 2000, in a total of nine movies, including cameos and three solo movies, so speculation was obviously rife as to whether he was being killed off or replaced, the now dishevelled and more vulnerable Jackman really creates pathos, Stewart as the weakened Professor X also does fantastic in what is his final X-Men movie as well. This is a most interesting entry in the series, for its raw quality, stripping away massive set piece sequences and going down a slow-burner road movie style, and it is much more adult, more swearing and much more gory violence, you question why it is not an 18 certificate at times, it has a good script and gets you excited when it needs to, it is definitely a suitable end for the clawed superhero we loved, a great superhero action thriller.

201,7 May 2019,harrylosborne,8," Gritty, dark, and everything missing from the rest of the X-Men franchise","Superhero films typically have to go down one of two avenues: colourful and humorous (e.g. Avengers, GotG) or more realistic and tough (e.g. The Dark Knight, Watchmen). Logan opts for the latter, producing a film worthy of Hugh Jackman, an actor typically starved of decent screen roles when playing Wolverine. Previous instalments in the Wolverine franchise have been average to poor, making Logan an important film for multiple reasons (especially given X-Men's loss of ground to the rest of the Marvel universe). By stepping away from the rest of the Marvel universe, the story doesn't become saturated with other characters crowbarred into the plot, giving Wolverine what he deserves.",

It destroys everything the movie that proceeded it (""Days of Future Past"") accomplished. In ""DOFP"", all of mutant kind are about to be destroyed, but by the heroic actions of Logan himself, they survive. Then, according to the film ""Logan"", they all get killed off a few years later anyways. It has been said that one of the big themes of ""Logan"" was disappointment. I agree. I was very disappointed in this film.",
204,4 November 2019,MrPupkin,9, Jackman twists the pain at the centre of the hero's struggle into remarkably uncomfortable places for a blockbuster.,The X-Men universe is so good and Logan was one way to end a chapter in tears. It was very good but it sucked to see your favorite heroes old and unable to do the amazing things they used to do with zero effort. The plot is good and it relates to relationships Wolverine has with everyone in the movie.,
205,6 March 2017,robinerrin,2, Great acting could not save a bad storyline,"I don't understand how this film is receiving such great reviews. The story-line is depressing and predictable. As always, I enjoy seeing both Jackman and Stewart as they are both amazing actors. The movie though? Worst of all the X-Men movies (even worse than the 3rd one from the original trilogy which is saying something). The violence was so over-the-top it was actually distracting. Some aspects were left completely unexplained (like the writers simply expected the viewers to 'know' - i.e. what was wrong with Xavier's mind, who the Reavers are and 'why' they have 1 metal hand, why there are no mutants left). The kid was fine when she wasn't speaking but then she wouldn't shut up so she became very irritating. Her 'attachment' to Logan really made no sense at all since she had just met him (and now she's crying over his body saying 'daddy'? Really?). Maybe I just didn't like it because they kill off everyone I liked. The best part of the movie was the 3 minute 'teaser' at the beginning for Deadpool.",

207,17 April 2017,thesar-2,5," Thank you. Now, Reboot!","The moment everyone craved as arrived! No longer is there a wait for  the most simultaneously realistic, R-rated and miserable superhero film  of all time: Logan.  Seriously, they wanted a serious Wolverine movie. We got it. Just, as  always, be careful what you wish for.  It's hard to rate this movie low because of the production values,  acting and no-holds-barred R-rating. But, on the flipside, it's hard to  recommend this movie because it's so off-the-beaten-superhero path,  it's set 12 years into the future with about .0005% future proof and  worst of all: it's incredibly depressing.  Sadly, someone online spoiled two main points in  this movie, so I knew what to expect. What I didn't see coming, though,  was how sad this movie was. If you love superhero movies, hope and fun  X-Men unity, look elsewhere. This movie is the equivalent of sitting in  the hospice waiting room with your loved one a couple of doors down the  halland just patiently waiting.  BUT, I suppose everyone demanded it. Everyone wanted the Hard-R  Wolverine movie. So here it is. In all its surprising simplicity.  The supposedly invincible and ageless ""Old-Man"" Logan is feeling he's  finally on his way out, but he reluctantly agrees to one more mission:  take a girl to the Promised Land. Along the way, the two people he  cares the most about are just as hunted as he is.  While I cannot deny this was a well-made film, I doubt I will be  watching this again. I usually don't wish for reboots of series, but I  do now. Here. This was a perfect final X-Men filmof the Fox Age. Give  it up, Fox!  Also, I'm not all about Disney having supreme rule over the Earthor at  least, Earth's (Real) Mightiest Heroesbut, now, hand this franchise  over to capable hands. Reboot it. Call it, The Uncanny X-Men. I don't  care. But, see this as a true end to that long string of foX-Men films.  And remember what it's like to have fun with superhero films. Heck,  even Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, combined,  wasn't 10% as bleak as this.  ***  Final thoughts: Admittedly, I fell asleep twice in this movie. I'm not  going to go as far as to say this movie is boring, but yeah, sometimes  it drags, is too heavy, dark, melancholy and was way too long for such  a simple plot. So, being boringisn't the only flaw.",
208,16 September 2017,jamesrupert2014,7, Grim entry into the Wolverine saga: a big improvement over its two antecedents,"'Logan' continues the darkening trend in 'super-hero' movies, and being rated ""R"", was allowed to be gruesome in addition to being grim and dark. The plot is pretty thin: essentially 'Logan' is a 'bonding-during-a-road-trip' movie back-dropped by the X-Men mythos. The storyline allows Hugh Jackson and Patrick Stewart to showcase their acting abilities (a big step up for both from the 2D comic book characters they played in other entries in the franchise). There are a number of plot holes and inconsistencies, but that's nothing new for the genre and, all in all, the story is interesting and (spoilers hinted at) its position in the overall X-man/Wolverine story-arc allows outcomes not possible in earlier chapters. Probably as close to that oxymoron ""an adult-superhero movie"" as I've seen (other than the much superior ""The Dark Knight""). A bit slow at times but generally watchable: not as great as some reviewers gush but a lot better than many of the entries in the Marvel (or DC) film-verse",

Taking place in 2029 when the whole world is changing, this epic movie features Hugh Jackman as Logan as he tries to take care of an ailing Professor X, played with gusto performance by Patrick Stewart. Along the way (spoiler alert), he meets his long lost daughter, Laura (played by Dafne Keen in her first major movie debut), who shares the same traits as her father but speaks little English. In the end, Professor X dies, then Logan by a clone, leaving behind Laura putting a cross vertically like an X to honor his legacy. Some scenes in this movie might be upsetting for people since it's an R rated movie. There is lots of violence, blood, and some seizure inducing scenes yet there's no sex. Some scenes the movie drags along yet it makes up for it with excellent action scenes. I consider Logan to be the best X-Men movie ever and quite possibly the best super hero movie of the year, even though there are more coming out later.",

While the CGI sequences were as protracted as they usually are in contemporary pop culture movies, they did not detract from the film's strong emotional content and were more integrated into every level of the story than they are in most comic book adaptations.

226,26 January 2021,chandean-69762,8, Logan 2017 Review,"The decision to make this rated R was such a perfect choice for both the tone and the story of this film. It's dark, gruesome, somber, and definitely gory. Hugh Jackman has his best act yet as he departs away from Wolverine (at least for now) carrying a huge, dark and heartbreaking performance.
Storytelling is also huge in this, definitely the darkest X-Men film thus far with huge stakes as our beaten down Wolverine and elderly Prof. X try to help Laura - a young mutant. The only thing that can be said negatively about this film is the pacing, the second act of this film is mostly traveling and learning about Laura and her past. But the first and final act all ride really fast and are thrilling to watch. Even with how dark this film is, theres some pretty solid humor in both the first and second act before taking an even darker tone in the final act.
And the action, oh man what do I even say. It's so brutal and gruesome its honestly just what we all wanted from a Wolverine film. Dafne Keen even has some crazy awesome action scenes. I hope we get to see more of her in this role.",

229,25 May 2017,tomgillespie2002,8," A brutal, angry movie","For the past 17 years, Hugh Jackman has played X-Man Wolverine nine times. It was the role that made him a star, and he's thanked Fox for having faith in him by sticking by the character regardless of how bad the franchise became. But at the age of 49, Jackman has decided to hang up his claws and trim the sideburns, taking a pay- cut in order to give the character the final send-off he truly deserves. He and director James Mangold, who joined forces to make stand-alone entry The Wolverine in 2013 only to see the studio step in and butcher the final edit, have persuaded Fox to go with an R rating. Whether this is down to the huge success of the wonderfully foul-mouthed Deadpool in 2016 or Fox feeling they owe the actor for his loyalty down the years, the results are pretty astonishing. With Logan, the camera no longer cuts away when Wolverine slices and dices, but captures his animalistic ferocity in all its bloody, decapitating glory.",

Unlike any other superhero movie, it has an attractive way at storytelling and cinematography. And it is one of the most realistic films in this genre. Its atmosphere and tone are just great for character. James Mangold has improved himself since The Wolverine(2013). He really understands the character and tells us how tired Logan is, how he cares about Charles and his indifference for other people. You can feel what Logan and Xavier have been through during years, movie successfully describes those and mutants situations in this universe, that's why storytelling is so well. Also it is enjoyable to see them in this situation, I mean when they at the end of the line. It has an epic and emotional final. Actually, I think it would be more effective on me if I wouldn't wait so long to watch it and learn he dies in that movie. Even though, I surprised so much when X-23 and X-24 showed up. On the other hand, movie have lovely details like X-Men's comics and action figures. Seeing Logan's reaction to those and seeing how people love Wolverine is nice. Finally, I want to thank Hugh Jackman for showing us his best on that iconic character for 17 years. He will never be forgotten as Wolverine.",

At once the film feels like a last hurrah and the culmination of every claw, every jab and every wound the Wolverine has received or doled out over nine films. Embodied in its solitary, grizzled and tired titular character however is an uncommon weight. Movies like this have been made before, that much is obvious - and while it's easy to predict Logan's every plot-point to a T, rarely has a movie like this been bolstered by so much, already laid cultural cache.

The mutant population has largely been obliterated and there aren't any new mutants being born. Logan is being employed as a limo-driver, he runs random people here and there for work. His plan is to eventually save up for a boat so he can take his mentor/friend Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Caliban (Stephen Merchant) and isolate them from the world. We know Xavier has telepathic powers but they're starting to decay and with his mindset deteriorating, he's become a danger to not only himself but to society.

245,12 December 2020,drfcx,9, What the X-Men franchise should have always been,"I decided December would be X-Men month. Watching the films in chronological order so I understood the storyline. In comparison to the avengers storyline, X-Men barely seemed worth making, the concept is solid, but the end product lacked in almost all accounts, 2d characters, bad villains, poor pacing,And bad writing. I would have probably placed the X-Men franchise around 4.5/10.
Then I watched Logan. Had every other x-men film been created to the same standard as Logan (exceptions being the Deadpool series), avengers would have a serious contender.
From the outset the grittier violence level, darker tones and lack of silly outfits sets this apart immediately. Picking out a small cast of remaining mutants only helps as it finally gives the audience time to develop a relationship with the X-Men, understand their flaws, and garnish them with a sense of humour, something the franchise has been lacking dearly in its overwhelming pursuit of seriousness.
Stripping back the X-Men, and removing much of the technology, vast casts, and grandeur did Logan a world of good. The improved writing really allowed Hugh Jackman to shine, well beyond what I thought he was capable of, and despite sharing the screen with Patrick Stewart, he really held his own, as did Dafne Keen.
Keen really did shine bright here, despite. Being mute for most the film she still managed to feed us with enough character.
This is a brilliant film, I can understand where my fellow reviewers are coming from but I think many of them are wrong to be overly critical. This was an outstanding addition to the franchise. Void of all the previous X-Men failings. It should have always been gritty and well thought from the very beginning.",

It features brilliant performances from Jackman and Stewart that take the characters to new places. I'll agree with some, it isn't a fun movie. Wolverine is not cracking wise at all. This is a depressing bleak movie. I admire it for it's ability to go there. It has weight and we fear for our characters. They aren't super humans who can laugh at danger. ",

And by the way I am not a ""fan"" of the Wolverine comic books, I happen to like a few of them from the 80s. So I don't go to the cinema expecting to see a comic book I already have in my shelves. So what did I find in this film? A boring, unoriginal and unimaginative movie, willing to satisfy the appetites of fans left open in prior attempts of the franchise, full of moronic routines I won't bother to list. The occasional comedy moments are jokes based around the walking disability of a character, so expect the laughs to border the derogatory. And the choreographed ""over the top"" slashing violence quickly becomes dull and repetitive. Plus... there is also a lot of violence dispensed to kids, and by kids. Kids are shot, stabbed and kicked -a lot. And in turn the same kids stab back, slash back, electrify and decapitate. Which is creepy if you ask me, as for this alone the film merits to be a horror movie -which it ain't. Last, lots of people are saying the story is based in a comic book series titled OLD MAN LOGAN. OK, please don't. Because in this film (do I need to say... SPOILERS AHEAD?) Wolverine, now Logan, works as a limo driver to make money and buy anti seizure medication for Prof. X and hopes to make enough dough to buy a boat and go live in the middle of the ocean with same Prof. X. Do you find any resemblance in that with the comic book series? I guess not. The only thing in common with OLD MAN LOGAN is that Logan is OLD. End of similarities. Yeah, just skip it I guess.",

These movies are getting worse and worse. If someone is writing a good review for this movie they are feeding of the hype. Even the story is boring and the it's so desperate they cloned wolverine. I really don't know what it is with Hollywood and bringing little kids in the movie that are annoying. Characters were so bad I didn't even care they died. I felt nothing during this entire movie it was so bad. More boring? Wait, while you're at it why not bring in monkeys?",

258,8 March 2017,Flamingwoks,3, Poor editing and script led to one of the most tiresome films i've seen in years.,"I'm frankly astonished by all the positive reviews, especially those comparing this to ""The Dark knight"". The films tone leans towards edgy rather than dark in my opinion with profuse use of unnecessary cursing making it feel like an 18 year old was hired to spice up the dull plodding nature of each scene. Moments felt like the Coen brothers ""No country for old men"" was lifted whole sale and stitched onto the plot of ""Children of men"" with a smattering of ""Xmen 2"". Not necessarily the worst idea ever, but the execution just leads to a painful and cringe worthy experience. Many moments I found my hands raised in disbelief as mutants forgot they had powers. Antagonists failed to use even a percent of their brain when attacking their non Wolverine targets (""YOU HAVE GUNS SHOOT THEM"" was a message I found on my lips at multiple points in the film). Some scenes were so drawn out if the film hadn't been two and a half hours long I'd think they were playing for time (see: Logan exiting a car, sighting a mountain, seeing a girl, falling over, being winched up a cliff, 15 minutes of information being conveyed extraordinarily slowly (that we already knew and had been told before) the full scene took 20 minutes to end with nothing new being learnt, nothing interesting happening and the plot exactly were it left off). Bad acting is present throughout with the exception of Patrick Stewart and Eriq La Salle. Please do not let Dafne Keen star in any more films until she has been taught finesse and timing. Pacing, CGI (the fence scene is especially noticeable), script and attempts at political finger pointing all hinder this film greatly. The films greatest crime though, the ending. Someone explain to me what a territorial border has to offer against PMC with seemingly limitless funds?",

OK it has violence but Marvel movies is not only about that . Heroes where created to give hope in difficult times and of course to entertain people and now its all gone . I know this was in the comics too ( Every Heroe dies ) but making it a movie was just like saying goodbye to childhood and it was awful! First of all if they continue to make movies with heroes die then one day we will wake up and their will be no more new hero movies to see. Plus SERIOUSLY THEY DIE FROM NORMAL HUMANS????

This was still a wonderful movie and possibly my favorite of the year so far. What's amazing is that the film has relatively few characters but is still engaging. It's great to see not just Wolverine, but also Professor X star in this. Yeah, I admit that I don't like the idea of all the other mutants having died out, but we still got an awesome movie out of it. What I also love is how real this film is.

And as wordy as I am, I'm ironically just posting this review to save people time that could be better spent elsewhere. So here goes... my fast review",
272,21 March 2017,lark40,10, an indestructible no more his primal instincts ravaged he is the last of his kind as he walks his line here him roar one last time,"Logan is like god of war in the PlayStation games sick of fighting looking to be left alone seeking revenge and sick of people dying in this 2hrs and 17mins it just feels like he has not care in the world here is the best film of the year so far director James mangold who done the original wolverine does the opposite of what a superhero film should feel and look this is what an end to a superheroes life is like a risky look that might alienate people but it gets it right Hugh Jackman gets to the heart of wolverine where his friends have died he is a superhero carer for charlies Xavier in his cerebrum little box in the middle of the Mexico desert with an albino watchdog called Caliban Hugh has learned how to play a lone wolf in wolverine and in this he is conflicted tired and vulnerable not like the young wolverine with zest but there is some life in the old dog but he is on his last legs as he needs medicine for Xavier's nightmare seizures that rattle everybody brain and only a few can survive his brain is a w.m.d Logan expects us to take it seriously – and we actually can because the last two were good this just blows the rest them out of the water he was young showing how indestructible he can be this one he is lost but finds a purpose when a stranger comes along Logan's darkness is not simply an aesthetic filter as in Batman v Superman Logan's darkness is not simply an aesthetic filter as was the case in Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice; it emanates from within the character. It's ironic that the title shares some DNA with the famously campy 1970s sci-fi film, Logan's Run, in which people are considered obsolete at 30 and murdered. In its way, Logan is just as much about the pitilessness of the aging process, and Jackman's battle-scarred, stiffening body is as expressive in this regard as his perma-scowl of a face. It's taking him longer to heal, his eyes are never clear and one of his claws won't fully extend. This makes him less Logan's Run, more Logan's Limp. He's as battered a superhero as we've ever seen, and for the first time his body bears exterior witness to the inner torture that has always defined him. His body is the story.we go on a road trip of sorts through the through the Midwest through to Dakota The film's plot kicks into overdrive when Logan's fate becomes entangled with that of Laura (Keen), a close-to-feral young girl who brandishes claws and fury as fierce and lethal as Logan's own. As the unlikely trio go on the run, we see echoes of Logan himself in Laura's terrifying rage and the tentative emotional connection she forges with Xavier. It's one of many smart moves on the part of James Mangold, who does double duty as director and co-writer. Bringing Laura into the picture allows him to explore Logan's trauma, regret and hope through the filter of this pint-sized powerhouse's origin story But Logan does go defiantly against the grain by favouring melancholic mood and themes of mortality and deterioration over inflated, end-of-the-world stakes or grandiose action pyrotechnics So despite an almost pathological reluctance to get involved, Wolverine is drawn into the role of protector, in a manner that the screenplay, co-written by Mangold, Scott Frank and Michael Green, keeps from getting overly sentimental, while still providing the film with what little emotional uplift it has In an era of cinematic product homogenization there's no doubt that Logan is a risky proposition. But this is reportedly Jackman's last time donning those claws and chewing on that cigar. Considering it was his Wolverine, as the centerpiece of Bryan Singer's X-Men (2000), who launched the currently omnipresent superhero phenomenon in the first place, maybe the most appropriate thing would be that, with the brutal, melancholic elegy that is Logan, Wolverine remakes the superhero movie again, this time as a farewell. After 17 years and 8 other X-Men movies, Hugh Jackman returns as James 'Logan' Howlett aka Wolverine for one final time. Set in the near future, Logan currently makes a hopeless and depressing living as a limo driver for whoever gives him a call. No mutants have been born in over two decades and almost everyone he knows is either dead or doesn't care anymore. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is bedridden with a rapidly deteriorating mind and requires regular medication to keep his psychic abilities in check. These two have been surviving day to day and refusing to talk about the past until a young girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) comes along in need of Logan's protection. And as he finds people to help and hide out dark forces are never far behind testing Logan and the child out as well as her young gifted friends can Logan protect and get them to their safe haven but the journey is perilous To say any more would ruin one of the potential films of the year. You can definitely watch it having never seen an X-Men film before, but you just aren't going to get that emotional investment from knowing you're seeing an actor play a role he has become synonymous with for the very last time. Logan is full of surprises, not for kids, a great farewell to Hugh Jackmans role as Wolverine and overall just a fantastic film. We will miss Hugh in his iconic role but this is the definite role but I gave this a well deserving 10 its going to better at the box office that his other two wolverine",
273,21 June 2017,johncorcione,8, This Movie Stands on its Own,I was pleasantly Surprised on this movie. What held it for me is that you didn't need all the other marvel comic characters in the film.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film.,
274,20 April 2017,Vivekmaru45,7, Perhaps The Last Time We See Hugh Jackman And Patrick Stewart In An X-Men Movie.,"Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are my favorite actors.

This film benefits from its R rating. The action is great and the story is too. This film is heartbreaking, yet has moments that feel very happy. It do feel like a superhero movie which I really like. This film looks at things like regret and redemption which really works for the character of Wolverine.

Hugh Jackman captured a comic accurate Wolverine in a way that hasn't been seen before, for any comic book character really. His grittiness and his ability to portray Wolverine as a shell of himself let you know this was most likely the end of a beloved character. The introduction of X-23 into live action film set a great foundation for the future of this story line. The young actress who played her was amazing.

I know many here think this is the CITIZEN KANE of action - X - superhero films and I suppose I could see ..... nope, cannot see that viewpoint. The X-Men series dies a bad death for me.

However, once a little girl (played by Dafne Keen) comes into play, the Wolverine is brought back into action. It turns out that this little girl has powers just like the Wolverine and she is being chased throughout the desert by dark forces - the dark forces that made her from Wolverine's DNA.

Logan spends his days working as a chauffeur Limo driver and hustling for prescription drugs in Texas. His body has aged greatly because We've never seen Wolverine this vulnerable. He's old, he's broken down, he's beaten. He can't heal like he used to.

286,3 March 2017,Thekeybaldemasterrises,10, I went back to the theater immediately to see it again. Not joking!!!,"Out of all the superhero movies coming in 2017 Logan was actually one of the few that sounded pointless to me. The X-Men franchise has been around for so long and it's run out of steam on many occasions as we well know. The last Wolverine outing for me was just meh. It wasn't great, but it wasn't X-men origins horrible either. It was just OK for me. My first impression was, ""Do we really need ANOTHER solo Wolverine?"" Let me tell you right now in case this review gets a little long, YES! It's not the movie we deserve but the movie we needed Dark Knight style. It's interesting because when the first trailer came out I thought it looked different but knowing that James Mangold would be directing I expected it to be more of the same as The Wolverine. I started hearing people talk about it and I would read interviews with Jackman, Stewart, and Mangold about the process of making the film. I learned more about what they hoped to achieve for it would most likely be Jackman's last performance as the character. It peaked my interest and I became a little more curious about what the Wolverine had cooking up for his last film. I had so many questions, what happened to everyone? Did saving the future really matter anymore? Why is Logan starting to show his true age? And quite frankly, when you get your answers you sometimes wish you didn't. This movie is grim, harsh, and unforgiving. It's a world where the X-men is all said and done, and mutants are dying out. Logan and Charles are at the end of their rope, they're war veterans that we recognize but act completely different from what we seen before. Both men dying slowly as the world just seems a little less bright. Until a light at the end of the tunnel, and we're introduced to X-23. A young mutant who shares strangely similar powers to Logan, and comes seeking their help to find her fellow mutants in their safe haven. As dark forces pursue X-23, Logan is brought back into the world of the X-men has he takes one last ride to help X-23, and to more importantly help himself. First and foremost huge props to James Mangold, his crew, and Fox for taking a huge creative risk with this movie. I'm going to assume Deadpool's success had a part to play in this because the R rating is totally used to it's advantage and it's brutal. You get to see Wolverine shred people to bits, and it's terrifyingly awesome. The movie has a dark and grim feeling where you really feel you're taking a harsh journey with these characters, but it never misses an opportunity to have a little fun with it. The cast just does a wonderful job holding their own and keeping the audience engaged despite the lack of action scenes. Which proves why X-men movies work when they take a more character driven focus(I'm looking at you Apocalypse). You want to see why everything's the way it is, you want Logan to survive, you want to know the dynamics of it all. X-23 will more than likely be a leading star in future films, and respectfully so. There's never a dull moment with her on screen, half of it she's just silent yet you still feel the emotional baggage she carries with her just as much as Logan and Charles. I'm trying so hard to find what I didn't like about the movie and I guess if I had to pick the weakest point, is the reveal of the true antagonist in the film. It almost seems unnecessary to force connections to previous movies but it didn't completely change my opinion of it overall. The movie set out to gave Logan an ending and did that, and arguably more. I'll have to be honest, this movie really hit me hard. To know that this his last movie after all these years, they didn't back down. I really felt stressed at times watching it because I wanted to know what happens next, and you know the movie really did a fantastic job when you're bawling before the credits even roll. I was so floored by my first screening that I immediately went back to the theater an hour later to watch it again. I'm not exaggerating this really was that good. Major congratulations and thanks to Mr. Hugh Jackman for bringing this character to life for the last 17 years. I grew up with the original trilogy and I just always remember always wanting to be like Wolverine, and you had those plastic claws from Toys R Us swinging them around the house. It's a shame to see him go especially when there are so many opportunities for him to show up again now that we have a successful Avengers franchise, as well as a new Deapool series along the way. I would encourage Ryan Reynolds to keep trying to convince Hugh to at least shoot a scene with him for the sequel, but I understand his reasons for leaving. It's definitely inevitable that somehow Fox will want to continue using Wolverine in future films but it's really hard to imagine anyone else replace Hugh, they've got big shoes to fill if that''s the case. Logan is without a doubt not just a great X-Men, or superhero movie. It's a fantastic movie in itself. So brutal and emotional you can see the passion and effort Hugh Jackman and company put into it if it's really his last one. if you're turned off by violence I would skip it of course. But the themes, the story really ends our pal Wolvie on a bittersweet but satisfying note, it deserves to be seen. I'm calling it now, it'll be the best superhero movie this year. It will set a high standard for comic book movies in the many years to come.",

288,19 July 2019,Abranth-d,10, Wow !,"Here's my super late review of Logan .So Logan was directed by the guy who directed the not so good wolverine movie where he fights asian dudes. And this time he sure made a comeback with Logan. So needless to say , Hugh Jackman was great as wolverine and the little girl who played x23 was great too , the bad guy was good but would've sucked if it weren't for the R rating. Patrick Stewart was 'okay' as for most of the movie , he's just an old dude in a wheelchair annoying Logan. There are many references to the previous x men movies but without giving reason on what happened to the rest of the x men .The story is not your typical superhero movie , its a road trip drama with lots of gorey action and that's the best part , because you see wolverine for the animal he is. So ,in the end , Logan is not just a good superhero movie but a great movie with loads of action , good one liners , great characters and one big farewell for Hugh Jackman.",

290,26 June 2022,fciocca,7, The proper farewell that Professor Xavier and Wolverine deserved.,"This is a perfect conclusion for the X-Men saga, and a proper farewell for two massive characters in the cinecomic genre. Despite having just a few dialogue lines, Laura is a well built and very complete character, the actress performed really well. The director created a special bond between her and Logan. Professor Xavier in this case is more of a side character, but he is absolutely necessary because he is the glue that will guide the two heroes, accomplishing their main goal. The movie is not scared to show the deepest and human side of these mutants: we get to see their most intimate emotions, vulnerabilities and weaknesses. We do not have in front of us the typical superhumans that cannot be killed. This is the main reason why I particularly enjoyed this film. The ending is bittersweet and for sure is not the usual ""lived happily ever after"" stuff. This is the perfect conclusion for an amazing saga that I followed since I was a teenager.

291,28 June 2021,ahnafakib-41045,10, Superhero movie of the year👊,"I think the marvel universe gift us the best action superhero showdown. I'm the biggest fan of wolverine. Hugh Jackman is my favourite actor. It's the best cinematic superhero thriller movie of all time. The main character of the movie is Logan, who is 100 years old that's why his healing powers not more stronger than before. Every graphics & sound system are very specific. I had seen all the part of X-Men but Logan is notable better than all part. Specially I like two part of X-Men. Logan(2017) & X-Men origins Wolverine. Cause there are many strong mutants in movie like Victor, Bloob, Zeru, John & the mutant killer the Deadpool. If you like science fiction-action-thriller cinematic movie, you should watch this movie.

This is a muddled-plodding movie where sacrifices are made by superheroes in such an insignificant way that it makes even the previous wolverine movies irrelevant. Hugh Jackman is a charismatic and talented actor and he was born to play the role of wolverine---but sadly here he is a shell of himself and you cannot wait for movie to end......movie never picks up pace, even though this is supposed to be a road movie....an anticlimactic, unsatisfying ending with confused half-hearted political undertones.

There is a character of a little girl, named Laura, who is a mini-wolverine, and in a round-a-bout way Laura is Logan's daughter. In the movie, Logan and Laura do make a family bond with each other, like robots make bonds with each other. Logan and Laura are mutants and they kill. They are the opposite of pacifists. They kill like animals in order to survive. Like a deer escaping from a lion, or a deer beating a lion in an attack. It is Darwinism. And lucky if the deer can escape a savage lion, like Logan and Laura being able to escape the mad scientists. Logan and Laura both have an instinct to live. They do not seem to have a direct mission in life, like to save other people from the unfairness in the world creating my evil or greed. I did like the reference to the comic book, with the coordinates of a safe-haven. This seemed to be a fantasy which turned out to be a reality.

Everyone is rough and ragged and tired. Unfortunately the mature tone of most of the film is diluted with the kind of comic book silliness seen in the other X-Men films (i.e. clones, evil scientists), so it's hard to accept scenes of beloved characters feeling intense emotions when they are immediately followed by adolescent ultraviolence in a campy situation.

314,10 July 2017,legerinia,1, The Worst X-Men Movie Thus Far. Very Disappointing.,"My wife and I rented a bunch of movies this weekend, and had a lazy weekend of watching various movies we thought would be interesting. Every movie we watched, we enjoyed thoroughly, except for this one. I'm not sure if it was the black and white colors of the movie, the crappy dialog, or the lack of action usually attributed with X-Men movies, or a mixture of all three, but we thought this one sucked on ice. We were very disappointed in this one, and we regretted renting it. It just lacks the appeal and the gusto that previous X-Men movies had. If you are a die hard X-Men fan, and you never miss a single one, then I guess you'll watch it anyway, but for you all who are just the casual watcher, then prepare to be let down by this one. I personally would say just save your money and don't bother with this one, but that's for you all to decide. As for my wife and I, we thought it was awful, and wish we could get our money back. So watch at your own risk, but don't say we didn't warn you. The only reason I gave it a 1 is because they won't let you give less than a one, it's that bad of a movie.",

322,4 August 2022,GusherPop,10, Best Marvel film since avengers,"Is ""Logan"" more powerful because of what the superhero genre has delivered over the last decade? Does it seem both groundbreaking and classic because it doesn't feel like a modern superhero movie, especially those with the Marvel brand? Don't worry. I'm not going to dissect the flaws of the Marvel and DC brands, but it's undeniable that the modern superhero movie has relied on CGI, particularly in final acts comprised almost entirely of apocalyptic explosions. And so many of them have served as bridges between franchise entries that one feels like they're constantly watching previews for the next movie instead of experiencing the one they're watching. ""Logan"" has stakes that feel real, and fight choreography that's fluid and gorgeous instead of just computer-generated effects. Most importantly, ""Logan"" has characters with which you identify and about whom you care. It's not just ""great for a superhero movie,"" it's a great movie for any genre. The Uncanny X-Men comics exist, meaning that Logan/Wolverine is like a retired sports hero or celebrity, someone who's recognized but no longer really essential. It is 2029 and mutants have been removed from the human bloodline, meaning that the creaky Logan and the nonagenarian Professor X (Patrick Stewart) are the end of an era. Or are they? ""Logan"" is the rare blockbuster that could be a game-changer. It will certainly change the way we look at other superhero movies and how history judges the entire MCU and DC Universe of films. ""Logan"" shows how deep one can go in the genre if they just approach it in a different way. In that sense, ""Logan"" deconstructs the modern superhero movie. It will be hard to put it back together again. One can look back on ""Logan"" and pull apart the themes and philosophies of the film, but it's important to note that it's a viscerally exciting film to experience.",
323,26 August 2017,soundoflight,7, Not bad for a superhero film,"I usually can't stand modern superhero films, the only exception being parts of Nolan's Batman series. But the mood of the first half of ""Logan"" is quite reminiscent of Nolan's work, as it brings a realism and humanity to these familiar, fantastic characters. There's something fascinating about an old, broken down Wolverine limping around half-drunk. Maybe I'm strange, but I almost wish the entire movie was just like the beginning: documenting the uninspiring life of washed up superheros. However, they just couldn't help themselves and the film's final act devolves into the typical kind of nonsense I've come to expect from Marvel movies. It almost seems like a different film at the end from the one that started.",
324,21 May 2019,SugarandIce,10, The Last Dance,"Why is it that so many of the best superhero films are the ones where the superhero elements feel secondary? Where the characters feel human first and super second? Where the story is down to earth and barely a comic-book film at all? Winter Soldier, Dark Knight, and now Logan... In truth, Logan may be better than both of those. It may be the best superhero film ever made. Then again, it's hard to say. Is it it even fair to call it a superhero film? It's more like a gritty western. This film is the perfect conclusion to the X-men films, and to Wolverine's tale. If X-men 3 ruined X-Men in the worst way, than Logan killed off the franchise (for me) in the best way possible. It broke my heart again and again. The characters I loved are at their absolute lowest and worst. The action has never been more spectacular and violent. Wolverine is at his absolute finest in brutality and in Hugh Jackman's performance. The inclusion of a new young girl mutant also brings in a great new character. This film left me in tears with all that occurred from beginning to end. It's so hard to sit through this film but I can't dislike it. Of all the X-men films, this one truly has the most heart.",

Grant, Doris Morgado, Elizabeth Rodriguez, Eriq La Salle, Elise Neal, Reynaldo Gallegos, David Kallaway, Frank Gallegos, James Moses Black, Dave Davis, and Julia Holt Directed By: James Mangold Review Back in 2003 I saw X-Men 2 United, after taht I became a big X-Men film fan. I knew very little about the comics but the few cast members that stood out to me where Halle Berry as Storm, Ian McKellen as Magneto, Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier and of course my favorite Hugh Jackman as The Wolverine. I never wanted him to leave the role, but unfortunately all good things must come to an end. In the year 2029 Logan is an uber driver and he gets tasked with talking a young girl named Laura to North Dakota. He takes Professor Xavier with him and they pretty much go on a road trip half the movie fighting off this task force that wants to get Laura and the rest of the unnatural mutant children. This is a much smaller story and even though I prefer bigger sets, stakes, action and adventure. I was not displeased I really loved all the action in this movie and all the scenes with Logan interacting with Charles Xavier. As soon as you see Donald Pierce coming for Laura at Wolverine's crib your just like oh doucebag alert. If there is anything we should give this movie its that whenever there's a movie with violence towards children they cut away no matter if it's R or Pg-13. But here they don't do that. Hugh Jackman puts his heart&Soul in this final performance as everyone's favorite mutant. Patrick Stewart should win an Oscar even though he won't but his performance had me in tears. Dafne Keen was an amazing little girl she was pulling in her own with two award nominated actors and this is just her first movie. After seventeen years and nine X-Men movies I don't need anymore I've seen this franchise at it's lowest and highest. All of the old X-Men cast have finished thee movies.

328,20 December 2019,MickeyTheConstant,10, A fitting send off,"The thing I liked most about this movie was that it dealt with real issues. I am not obviously referring to cyborgs and mutants etc. Although at heart a superhero movie it was more of a toad trip where those on the ride, whilst being hunted down had to deal with the real issues of getting old, dementia, deteriorating health, not being the person you once were, realising (for some) you don't really fit in, loneliness and also loss and grieving. Many of these things our hero Wolvie has had to deal with throughout his long life but the aging and health issues are all new for him. In the past he never really had a family or loved ones but the X-Men became his family and he began to care and love. Now, mostly on his own, in pain, the loss and loneliness is kicking in and in many ways he can see the real curse of his once non ageing and healing powers. It's sad at times, often fun and joyous and also incredibly violent. The violence set the tone for what is now becoming a genre of its own, the adult superhero movie. Refreshing in so many ways.

335,9 October 2017,avik-basu1889,8, The Legend of Wolverine/Logan !!!,"The R-rated comic book movie as a concept isn't as new as some think it is. Be it the 'Blade' films or 'Kickass', bloody comic book movies have existed before too. But in modern pop culture due to the somewhat homogenization of the comic-book genre due to the big bloated cgi- heavy spectacle filmmaking that the audience has been subjected to with the MCU and other franchises, when Deadpool was released, it became a major box-office success. 'Deadpool' was deemed to be a representation of what could be done with the super-hero genre. However while 'Deadpool' was about dissecting the super-hero genre in a meta- comedic, self referential way with a heavy dose of juvenile humour, 'Logan' is about dissecting the super-hero genre by attempting to add a sense of maturity to the films by introducing elements of existentialism and mortality, themes which most comic book/super- hero films of this era tend to shy away from confronting or exploring in a serious way. There is a scene in 'Logan' in which Logan, Laura and Professor X are trying to escape from a group of men in their car(limo). During that scene, there is a moment where Logan tries to ram the car through a steel fence. In a general MCU film, he would've been able to successfully ram it through the fence and get away. In 'Deadpool', he would've again managed to do it successfully, but this time it would've been followed by a self-referential joke about how that shouldn't have happened in a realistic sense, but since this is a comic- book film, anything is allowed. However in 'Logan' not only does he NOT manage to ram the car through the fence, the steel grills get awkwardly stuck near the front wheels of the car. That moment in the film visually represents the mature sense of slightly elevated realism that 'Logan' is striving for. The film and its themes work to a great extent due to the performances. Hugh Jackman has always been good as Wolverine, but this is probably his best performance as the aforementioned mutant. His general demeanour, physical appearance and overall presence exude a sense of world-weariness, a sense of exhaustion and emotional surrender complementing the usual rugged, hard-boiled grit that Jackman is known for in his Wolverine portrayals. The father- son-like dynamics between Sir Patrick Stewart's Professor X and Logan felt very realistic in the way they constantly bicker and argue even though there is a clear sense of mutual love simmering beneath. Daphne Keen is also very good as Laura. 'Logan' keeping in tune with 'Deadpool' attempts to be meta to some extent. There is a moment where Logan pulls up an X-men comic book and talks about how the comic books fabricate reality and add sensationalism to make everything look magical. He specifically states that in real life, people die unlike the make-believe world of comic books. This might make someone believe that the director James Mangold is trying to completely sever all ties that the film might have with its comic book roots. But with the way the concept of Eden gets played out here, Mangold makes sure that he pays a tribute to the feeling of hope, wonder and fantasy that comic books can offer to the minds of the readers.",

The brooding X-Man mutant with the long, retractable claws and healing powers has been featured in several Marvel comic book series since the 1970s, not to mention video games, TV series and, of course, films. Hugh Jackman has played the character in almost all of the X-Men films, including three based solely on his character. In 2009, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" takes the character from his childhood in 1840s Canada through several wars and into league with Professor Xavier and the X-Men. 2013's ""Wolverine"" is set mostly in modern Japan and sees the title character struggling with the ""curse"" of his invulnerability. 2017's ""Logan"" (R, 2:17) is inspired by the 2008 graphic novel ""Old Man Logan"".

I liked the dystopian feel that this movie came with made it more of a serious tone which is a nice change from some other super hero movies. It wasn't the greatest x-men movie of all time but it wasn't the worst either it was just a good entertaining show. The villain was kind of lame and the evil cloned version of Logan felt a bit lazy in my opinion I think they could have pulled one of his lesser known villains like Daken to be the main villain.

369,20 March 2017,drqshadow-reviews,8, Wolverine's Finest Hour is Also Jackman's Last,"A very hard R for Hugh Jackman's last call as Wolverine, easily the most unapologetically dark, violent take we've ever seen from a Marvel property. It's a jolt at first, but also necessary to effectively and immediately shift the tone from the campier tendencies of the greater X-Men franchise to the sad, defeated near-future of this timeline. There's a bucketful of carnage, but also a wealth of character moments, particularly between Xavier, Logan and Laura, the young mutant also known as X-23. This area has always been trouble for Fox's X-films, with so many faces cramming the screen that it can often be tough to remember names, let alone a convincing motivation. This time, that scope is kept intentionally narrow, and it bears ripe fruit. Particularly during the gut-wrenching final scenes, which not only deliver a strong sense of closure to all three arcs, but also reveal the troubling reality that tomorrow's heroes may have already been corrupted by the path they've unwillingly marched. Outstanding work from the leading actors, particularly Jackman and Stewart, who have a long and successful chemistry together, and a surprisingly bright supporting effort from Stephen Merchant, of all people. It's a bold finale that should finally give mature fans of the genre something wet and meaty to sink their teeth into. Refreshing proof that not every superhero story needs to be bleached for a younger audience.",

373,20 March 2017,Marx_Bros_Fan86,9, Great drama and action all in one,"Hugh Jackman's supposed last outing as Wolverine in Logan was quite the gamble for 20th Century Fox. Could they pull off another R rated superhero movie? Could they pull off a superhero movie with a low key story? I'm happy to say that Fox and director James Mangold pulled it off with flying colors. Logan is the perfect sendoff for Hugh Jackman, who has played Wolverine in nine movies over seventeen years, and it's hard to see how anyone can replace him (and you know they will eventually). Logan is a character driven drama that evokes classic Westerns like Shane and Unforgiven, while still being a superhero movie. With the market saturated with superhero movies, Fox has shown that you can still make superhero movies that feel fresh, and they should really make this kind of film their niche. ",

377,7 June 2017,timothyalanwilliams,6," Sad ""Logan"" Isn't Too Much Fun","""Logan"" is the last chapter of Hugh Jackman's stand-alone Wolverine trilogy and has been one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year. Being the first R rated film in the franchise and Hugh's swan song to his most recognized role, you can expect to see a very different kind of superhero movie. And that's exactly what ""Logan"" delivers...for better or for worse. Set in 2029, we find Logan (with a frail Professor X and their hired help, Caliban) trying to lay low as a limousine driver. His secret identity is quickly blown by a woman and child who beg him for safe passage from some dangerous men who are after the child. As you garner from the previews, the child, Laura, has similar mutant tendencies as old man Logan. What follows is not your typical superhero flick. There are no aliens. No sinister plot to destroy the planet. No assembling of other heroes to defeat an army of attackers. It's just Wolverine protecting and defending those he has learned to care about. There is plenty of violent and bloody action. This is much more ""John Wick"" than ""Captain America"". I believe this is the first time you see blood on (and spraying from) Wolverine's blades during his fight scenes. And because of the R rating get ready to hear everyone drop the f-bomb frequently (I think it's the only word Logan uses for the first 10 minutes of the film). Leave the kids at home. This is NOT that kind of superhero movie. The biggest downer for me is the overall sad tone throughout the whole movie. There's not much ""fun"" to be had on this ride. ""Logan"" is serious, violent, and yes, even emotional. Like I said, not your typical superhero movie. It's very much the Ying to last year's breakout R rated superhero movie Deadpool's Yang. Where ""Deadpool"" came for your laughs, ""Logan"" aims for tears.",

The mentor is taken out by the villain, makes the superhero very angry who in the end sacrifices himself, killing the villain and the young one goes free into an unclear future. Any person should be able to predict the ending of the movie after just watching 10 minutes of the start and here are people comparing this with the Dark Knight!!!! Unbelievable!!!! 2) The prey seems to be running after the predator in the movie. The kids with superpowers are already trained as shown in the movie. They are not poor scared souls, they are lethal, mentally and physically. You can see glimpses of that during the end, when they kill off the mercenaries ruthlessly. With their unique powers combined, its a surprise they were even once contained in a facility. Sometimes you can see the kinds wimping and crying and few moments later they freeze someone off or electrocute someone without remorse. 3) Logan witnesses a group of drones towards the end which makes him realize that the kids are in danger. Why on earth would a dozen surveillance drones move around in a bunch? Shouldn't they be spread out to do their job better or was their job to get noticed by wolverine 4) X-24 was shot by an adamantium bullet in the end which blew half his head off. When wolverine was shot by that bullet in X Men Origins he only lost his memory, another inconsistency. 5) Professor X knew well that they had a vicious mercenary group hell bent after them. Why on Earth would he then suggest that they spend the night at the Munsons'? That's the most stupid thing to do. Oh yes now I get it why, its so that the mutant wolverine can be introduced in the movie and it was the perfect time for him to die. Killed by someone who he thought was Logan, that's sure to get a lot of sympathy right there. 6)Logan clearly knows that they are supposed to keep a low profile, in spite of that he picks up a fight with the Reavers 7) The producers had this project nicely figured out. Kill Wolverine, kill professor X, earn a lot of sympathy and thereby earn a lot of money. Also keep a bunch of mutant kids alive so that in case they fall short of lunch money, well you know what they will be working on. There are scores of mistakes with the story line but I do not wish to waste any more of my time so my advice for those who haven't watched this movie yet, don't.",

Take director James Mangold's ""Logan"" which he also wrote. This movie is certainly a vehicle for Hugh Jackman, who has been in no less than half- a-dozen superhero movies at least. It was likely written specifically for him. Mangold smartly has made his super-heroes mortal and given his story more gravitas. The story feels like a variation of what we've seen before, but the subject of aging and death is right out in the open. It's a fresh and mostly honest look for a Super-hero movie, although the violence is explicitly graphic and maybe could've used a bit of a tone- down.

They also have some of the best story lines, even though this one is not part of their long illustrious mythology, it's still rings true to their comic based characters, and since the comics itself had already presented us with so many alternate realities, none can complain if it doesn't follow a precise story from the comic books.",

The film given an R rated direction, makes it even gritty when it comes to its brutal bloody violence and a more profane Wolverine.

However, every time I went back to the channel, which was about four times or so, the same thing was happening. Running away from the same men. Fighting them off. At the end Logan dies. I wonder whose idea it was to make this? In my opinion, if you want to become a legion in movies, you always have to be the hero. For example, John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Paul Newman, etc. To me, it was the worst way to go away from a series. Why would this be done so differently from the rest? It has shown me how classless all of you people who put this together are. Tell me, did your children see it? Were all of you proud that they could see it? Have all of you fallen down so far from normalcy, you can't see how far you have gone. I have no desire to see the whole move, so I won't.",

This brought me much excitement to hear such great things from a very anticipated movie. Then that excitement quickly turned to disappointment as I didn't come to think this film was anywhere near the excellence of ""The Dark Knight."" ""Logan"" was quite unconventional for a superhero movie as in it wasn't a superhero movie but an antihero action drama. An antihero action drama that had a hollow story, slow pacing, frustrating ambiguity, redundant action, and ineffective emotional resonance.",

The filmmakers defied the odds and made ""Logan"", an homage and farewell to the one and only Wolverine we know and love.",
407,23 March 2017,tedd0093,9, Dramatic and perfect in every way.,"My expectations for this movie where pretty high, while the feeling i had walking out of the cinema was based in pure satisfaction. The start is setting up the later on too-old-for-this-sh*t Logan, who is driven by the existence of the former school leader and teacher Charles Xavier. The bond between him and Charles has changed a lot since the older x-men movies, and has created this humorous yet desperate feeling towards the plot. ",

I like the X-men but am sort of the guy who'll stick to the original and think the follow ups are so and so, still this series is ahead of most others. But man, I am glad they made even one more, and I'm even more happy to see a sci-fi /fantasy that's beyond being just a good genre film. This is top notch and perhaps the best in the series. Fantastic to see actors aloud to really act in this type of film and not just show a prototype character, but there is so much more. Everything is well balanced, not to much of anything. I simply forgot about all the digital animation and can still feel the taste of real dust and dirt and some smell of blood. But, most of all, a great pleasure to see a new coming star. Dafne Keen is simply superb. Got nothing more to say - Go And See!",

Unlike 'Deadpool' this film is not a comedy. Far from it actually. This film is a brutal action movie filled with excessive violence resulting in a surfeit of blood, gore, and cursing. Which, surprisingly enough, is what any fan of Wolverine as a character has been waiting for. Finally, we get to witness Hugh Jackman tear people limb from limb in glorious, graphic violence. For this film, the biggest selling point, aside from the R rating, was the fact that Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are hanging it up after this film. This film will mark their last performances as their respective characters.",

I read comics in the Halcyon era of comics, the mid-80's to mid 90's. I was used to great storytelling and eccentric artwork (Cerebus The Aardvark, Mage - The Hero Discovered, Moonshadow, Nexus), and to this point, I loved watching the X-Men movies just to see characters like Nightcrawler come to life. I didn't think much of the stories in the movies - they're very much aimed at teenage audiences.

It has ramp-ed up the violence to the max and the end is quite good but too many problems mar this movie to make it a hit: - the setting never quite clicks: 12 years in the future they have the same phones and the same TVs? Mutantkind was eradicated? Not a big deal but it never seems right - the movie is a road movie? An action movie? A mix of the both with a lot of dead times and fairly filler moments - What it is not is a super hero movie. It has some of its tropes but lacks the overall sense of wonderment a superhero flick needs - The bad guys and main threat are really **meh** So yeah Hugh Jackman is OK, Patrick Stewart is OK, seeing a Wolverine unleashed on the screen has its moments but overall somewhat disappointed.",
418,16 August 2018,one9eighty,9, Genre defying next level superhero mic drop....,"Hugh Jackman reprises the role of James ""Logan"" Howlett, a.k.a. Wolverine in this latest, and possibly last outing. Set in a future where mutants have nearly all been wiped out the surviving groups are on the run and hiding from the law, this post-apocalyptic world is slightly reminiscent of the Death of Wolverine/ Old Man Logan comic arcs. His powers are failing, his friends are nearly all gone - in fact he's babysitting Professor X - Charles Xavier (Sir Patrick Stuart), whose powers have nearly gone and is suffering from dementia as well as other problems. Wolverine has a chance meeting that leads him to discover a young mutant with very similar powers to himself. He takes her, begrudgingly, under his wing and makes a run for safety. The plot isn't too much deeper than this as it's a character driven film which relies on the emotions and development to drive it rather than a overtly complex plot.",
419,9 March 2017,HockeyFan13,9," Raw, Brutal, Uncompromising and Outstanding",Logan has been on my radar for a while because it looked different. Super hero movies these days (this is not an insult it is common knowledge) have become somewhat formulaic.

426,23 August 2018,bobclasen-144-364538,1, Most Depressing Comic Book Movie Ever,"I finally watched the latest Wolverine movie, Logan. It was the darkest, most depressing comic book movie I have ever seen. The vision of the human race portrayed is so dark as to be hard for me to contemplate. I am surprised at the high ratings so many people gave it. Logan is a foul mouthed, depressed drunken grump who doesn't want to help anyone anymore in a world that has killed almost all of the mutant heroes of earlier movies. Patrick Stewart (Professor Xavier) is also drugged into a stupor to prevent him from having seizures (due to some unexplained brain ailment), which, due to his powers, threaten everyone around him. Virtually everyone Logan befriends in the movie except one young girl is assassinated by some evil corporation or branch of the government (it is not clear to me which) In the very end, some young mutants do escape from Horrible America to Canada. Everyone else dies. I don't think I'll be watching that little patch of pitch black again. Whatever happened to Heroes and Optimism in Hollywood? I notice Stan Lee did not appear in this movie. PS I like the first X-File movies and also the movie Wolverine.",

The film sets 12 years in the future where are no mutants born in over two decades, aging and alcoholic Logan tries to get along driving his limo and together with the albino mutant tracker Caliban taking care of Professor X somewhere in Mexico. Logan is supposed to take the young girl Laura Kinney to a refuge called Eden. But then the bio-tech firm Alkali-Transigen's head security comes and tries to take Laura, who turns out to be a blood clone of Logan, one of many other clones that are now in hiding. with today's technology and yesterday's music nothing gives the feeling that this is the future.",

435,9 July 2017,demented_peruvian,7, More of the same while trying to do an Eastwood flick,"James Mangold and Hugh Jackman teamed up to make a different Wolverine movie: more serious, inspired by westerns, in which our hero has to deal with mortality and regret, while being on the lam with a girl. That movie was called ""The Wolverine"". For ""Logan"" they decided to do something bold and different by... doing exactly the same, while adding nothing to Wolverine's story, except an ending. Okay, this time the girl is a child with special powers (you know from the trailer and the DVD jacket that she is connected to Wolverine; I won't spoil details), which makes the plot go exactly in the same beats as as every adult-with-child-on-the-lam flick, from ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" and ""Firestarter"" to ""Midnight Special"". The villains in their vans and helicopters behave like all those on-the-lam villains who somehow always arrive quickly to wherever the protagonists are, even at times when there's no plausible reason. Innocent people are befriended on the way, and pay a price.",
436,3 March 2017,riteshshergill,9, An adequate send off to Hugh Jackman in the role of wolverine,"One cannot help but feel a tinge of sadness when the end credits role for this movie. The realization that we will never get to see Hugh Jackman in this role again will set in when the screen fades for the final time on the role that Hugh Jackman has made so iconic over the years. What also pains me is the fact that we will never see Deadpool and Hugh Jackman's wolverine pair up on screen. Hugh Jackman was always the perfect choice to play the Wolverine and it will be hard for anyone to fill out those shoes. The movie itself though might not be perfect or novel, the performances by the cast are excellent. Sad to see Professor X go too. The violence in the movie was graphic but it wasn't a distraction, it helped build up the tension. Added to the fact that Logan cannot heal as quickly as he used to, every action sequence adds an element of vulnerability to his character. Hugh Jackman as always has acted very well and I feel that he should be felicitated for this effort. For die hard X-MEN fans this movie is a must see. It might be a little confusing for people who haven't been following the series but on its own as well it is a powerful movie.",
437,3 April 2017,blazedounal,10, Excellent movie but not super hero movie,"Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film.

It is near perfect, I would give it nine and a half out of ten, there are some slow spots, at times a bit too long of a slow spot but I've been fed a steady diet of quick flashes of explosions for the last thirty years.

The previous films in the x-men series had great acting, interesting story lines, and believable action. This film had shocking dialog, way too much swearing (not that i'm a prude, but it was totally out of character for all the actors) and took so long to get to the point, it became boring. Yes, there was action, but so far fetched it was terrible. Hugh Jackman is such a great actor, he must have felt pretty betrayed by this movie as it did him no favours at all.

The people calling this a masterpiece or ""the greatest superhero film of all-time"" are just buying into the marketing hype. The film is good however it does drag a lot.

468,3 March 2017,quinimdb,8, Logan,"""Logan"" is the answer to all of my Marvel movie prayers. Let me start by listing my problems with the other comic book films: firstly the lack of real stakes or sense of vulnerability for the characters. While the stakes are almost cartoonishly high in other Marvel movies, considering they are literally saving the world, what they fail to do is truly make us feel as if the main characters could be killed at all. Whenever anything bad happens to these characters, they seem to immediately bounce back, such as with Nick Fury, who was shot multiple times and came back later in the movie, and James Rhode, who fell from the sky, yet is now recovering. In ""Logan"", they aren't messing around. Not only are characters beat up, bruised, guilt-filled, and slowly deteriorating, but many important characters are killed, usually at the most unexpected moments. The gore is also realistic and often genuinely disturbing. Secondly, the visuals. I'm not saying that most Marvel movies have bad special effects, and I'm not even saying that the cinematography is bad, per se, it's just so... bland. The color palette is dull, and most everything (besides for some action scenes) is shot in the most boring and predictable way, with no real distinct visual style. In ""Logan"", the cinematography has a very dusty and rugged feel to it. Also, the scenes in which Professor X has his fits after not taking his medicine, in which he essentially freezes everyone, not allowing them to move, genuinely feel tense and uncomfortable due to their shaky and claustrophobic camera- work, and you can feel Logan's struggle to move. Finally, the music. Again, nothing really very wrong with the music in other Marvel films, just nothing that ever stands out as unique or interesting. Music isn't often used in this film, but when it is, it heightens the emotion of each scene, whether it be heartfelt and genuine or intense.",

The western tone gave the movie a distinct feeling, unlike any other superhero film, but gets boring in the lack of set pieces. The finale takes chances that are unexpected from these types of production companies, and really brings out a lot of emotions that one might not expect to feel when walking into this movie. In the end I decided to give Logan a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. Although it's a little higher than I wanted to give it, this is one of those movies that I feel will age better with time, ironically the opposite of Logan's character in Logan.",

Thankfully,they didn't make Laura a humanized baby groot,her character is fantastic,and she did a really good job as the vicious predator in the form of a little girl. Patrick Stewart was quite nice,sad to hear he'll be gone too. Boyd Holbrook was good,but they never really do something interesting with his character.

492,21 May 2017,spidervenom90,2, truly sad,"first off, i wanna ask is how the hell can you compare this depressing nihilistic, destructive horror film to the dark knight.....or ANY superhero film? superheros were meant to inspire good and hope...this film only destroyed those elements it completely baffles me how this destructive gore fest is being called ''the best superhero film of all time''. as for the dark knight trilogy-batman inspired people....even the criminals....logan starts off depressing and ends depressing. logan provided the perfect chance to restore the xmen and complete charels's dream by saving this dark, depressing world-yet, they chose to kill logan-and leave children trained to be weapons with no guidance, no hope to be anything more than weapons....this film spits on every xmen film before it, it spits on the xmen and the superhero gen as a whole and frankly, from what i've read-if it wasn't as graphic as it was- not very many people would've bothered....hell, one person here pretty much said this film would be nothing without the r rating! i saw the potential it had....but completely disregarded all that just to make a depressing, destructive, gore fest-frankly, i feel the r rating is what ruined this film. logan never liked killing in the past films- he would always try to avoid killing-here, he'll go out of his way to do so in the most graphic ways, logan is supposedly remorseful for the lives he's taken....yet, he kills more in this film-so i can't believe this, he also have a little girl who looks up to him.....and he continues killing! i can recall i quote from days of the future: I was your most helpless student, and you unlocked my mind. You showed me what I was, you showed me what I can be-so, in conclusion-he should've killed even less and he should've lived. so, i gives this film 2 stars-1 for the acting, another for the potential it had to be a masterpiece. i also wanna say that even though most say they can't relate to laura-i can, however. it's also worth mentioning logan has been a very influential character-taught me to never give up. another lesson completely overlooked is: just because someone stumbles and loses their path, doesn't mean they're lost forever. but, a quote that that should've been the theme here is: why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up! i also wanna say that the fact Laura is mute mostly is understandable-think about the crap she went through-would YOU be very social? one other thing i wanna address is statements regarding the children......of course they're gonna gonna be afraid.....they're abused children!",

He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. This really is one of the best superhero movies of all time. And best of all, it doesn't even feel like a superhero movie. Fantastic story and great acting all around.

504,10 October 2017,grobanworldnews,3, Highly overrated,"This movie is really over hyped and overrated. It is depressing and boring and has no real plot. I think it is overrated for two reasons--1) because it is rated R and 2) because it tried to be a ""different"" type of superhero movie by making the story a Western. Unfortunately, this film, much like that other overrated R-rated X- Men movie, Deadpool, goes overboard with the freedom of the less restrictive rating by loading itself with f-bombs and gory violence. I don't know why Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart agreed to the mediocre script that turns their once heroic characters into pathetic has beens. Logan is now a suicidal drunk and Charles is a decrepit, insane old man. Both men die pointless and violent deaths. The X-Men are decimated and everything they accomplished in the other movies was all for nothing. Logan has to get his female clone to Canada. The clone is a child who loves to dismember and behead grown men. Just really gruesome stuff. There is not hope or joy in this movie at all. The character of Caliban is just there as a plot device so Donald Pierce can use him to track Logan and his creepy clone. And, lastly, the villains are really lackluster and a huge disappointment. The Reavers, X-24, and Dr. Zander Rice are all bland and forgettable villains--some of the worst I have ever seen in any X-Men movie. Zander Rice is particularly awful, being nothing more that a generic mad scientist villain. Just a sad way to close the final chapter on the X-Men--a dark future where all the characters we've loved are doomed.",

Hugh Jackman pretty much plays a Wolverine that has almost given up on everything but when he needs to be the old Wolverine we get hit with a bit of nostalgia as he can be incredible brutal at times but when fighting you can tell he doesn't have much of the original Wolverine in him anymore and they show that incredibly well. Patrick Stewart plays a Charles Xavier that has a new ""power"" being the shape of seizures that affect everything around him and so relies of Logan even more to control them.

He's stubborn to the point of being almost dumb about his decisions, allowing bad things to happen to him Even a wolf would probably be even more intelligent, resilient, and resourceful than this version of Wolverine. The relationships between characters are stilted and not very meaningful. The plot lurches from one engagement to the next more like a video game than a thoughtful and emotive storyline. Even the predictable ending seems strained by the inability of the team of characters to really offer up a sensible and more likely scenario for a climatic ending.

James Mangold's The Wolverine I thought was close to being great but was held back by the pg-13 rating, weak third act and an awful cgi boss fight. Mangold this time is no longer constrained by a studio's need to feel like past superhero films and makes the movie that is a perfect reflection of the title characters's dark history.

526,7 March 2017,Troy_Campbell,8," Bleak, vicious and wonderful.","In 2000 a fresh-faced Aussie actor with only a handful of local credits to his name scored the prized role of Wolverine in Bryan Singer's X-Men. 17 years on, Hugh Jackman delivers his ninth and final performance as the metal-clawed mutant, and it's arguably his best. Set in the not-too-distant future where mutants are all but extinct, our eponymous antihero is eking out a living as a limo driver on the U.S-Mexico border, predominantly to fund his alcohol addiction but also to provide for the mentally declining Professor X (Patrick Stewart). Happy to drink his remaining years away, Logan's waste of a life is upended when he's forced upon to transport an enigmatic girl, Laura (Dafne Keen), across the country to safety. Shedding the usual superhero template, this entry into the X-Men universe plays out more like a slow-burn, gritty Western, or a violent, modern-noir road trip flick; you can take your pick. The emphasis on building character and atmosphere through weighty dialogue, metaphorical plot devices and an unrelentingly sombre tone won't be for everyone's tastes—especially those expecting the normal comic-book fare—but it's undeniably ballsy and mostly poignant. There are long stretches without action, however when the set pieces come along they're executed with a brutality that is both completely apt and utterly surprising. Wolvie slices and dices his way through hordes of henchmen, but this time they actually bleed. There's a reluctant grimness to the fighting this time around too; the carnage doled out by Logan is not presented as 'fun' or 'enjoyable' in the they-had-it-coming kind of way, but rather as a heavy burden that weighs him down. At the core of the proceedings is the two-hander between Jackman and newcomer Keen; the former all weary pessimism driven by regret, the latter naively filled with optimism and hope despite the odds against them. Anchored by two powerhouse central performances and a smart narrative that dispenses with superhero convention, Logan is the bleak, vicious and no-holds-barred farewell this iconic character deserved.",

Nothing new here as a stand alone movie. I don't believe the writer/director are in touch with the audience for this kind of movie. Superhero movies are about the characters and the characters don't die, they always come back. Good overcomes evil and that is the basis for superhero movies. This is not a superhero movie but an over dramatized look at the burdens of a superhero. So let's get real, people that like these movies want to see a hero exploit his superpowers for good. The don't want to see a superhero whine over and over about how bad it is to be superstrong. Just watch the first Hulk movie and how bad the review were. So much drama. So in this movie, the director throws in a lot of blood and violence I guess because he believes the audience is going to like it. Not really. Deadpool was fun to watch because of the comedy Ryan Reynolds brings to the scene. This movie was depressing from every angle. Just not a good superhero movie. Sad to see the two lead characters retire their roles in a poof of dust rather than go out blazing. Watch as a rental or on Netflix, but don't waste too much time. DC and Marvel universe have outpaced the wolverine saga, with story lines that are fantastic. This is a waste of time in comparison. Hugh Jackman was a great X-Men, but sadly he has failed in the last two solo movies to deliver the kind of epic superhero movie that could have rocked.",

However most viewers aren't comic connoisseurs and will have their knowledge from the previous movies, the comics and cartoons they were watching as a child and anything that the movie itself would present during its showing. Logan, however, does very little to explain the background of the setting or the characters. The actors do a great job of acting but it's lost on the viewer when you have no idea why things are happening in the movie. If the writers of this movie were focusing on a non standard lore path they should have made damn sure the viewer was more comfortable with the new, and contradicting, environment they're presented with and not assume we've read or even appreciated the alternative story line.

While movies like Spider Man, Captain America, and Iron Man were very popular among fans, the X-Men were quite underrated
I remember when X-Men first came out in 2000 and it was something out of this world especially being the first comic-based movie then a sequel came called X2 and that was even better than the first
After that was X-Men: Last Stand which was good but could have been better
X-Men Origins: Wolverine was very mediocre but watchable
Then came X-Men: First Class which was the prequel of the events of the first three movies and it was pretty good a different style
The Wolverine is a movie focused on the character, Logan, which follows the events of the first three movies and that was the Wolverine movie we all wanted but it didn't stop there
X-Men Days of the Future Past again centered on Wolverine as he must travel back in time to save the X-Men that was an amazing concept that was perfectly executed
Then Deadpool came as the first R-rated movie for Marvel and the highest grossing R-rated film Ryan Reynolds is the highlight of this movie and he is pretty funny
And there was X-Men: Apocalypse which was an okay movie",

543,16 January 2020,dnford,10, A new type of western,"My initial reaction to this movie was one of disappointment. What I heard was a triumph of a movie was in reality a cliche plot with failing heroes and a redneck villain. What?
Then I thought about this film in light of the other movies. People say it's the best standalone X-men film, but in reality it is the culmination of the others. The wanton killing, abuse of the manipulation of time, and repeated ignoring of a reasonable course of action has indeed freed the world from cataclysmic disaster, but has not given Logan more power. It's taken his toll, and now he dodders around, struggling to support a senile old man and save one little girl. It's not fanfare and parades that hail the return of wolverine but a failing liver and many unintentional naps. It makes so much sense, and it gives the film significance.
Logan has little new to offer in terms of traditional action films. But as a revolutionary take on the genre and an emotional exploration of Logan and Professor X, it truly is an incredible film.",

Now a lot of people say that this is a dark and gritty film and to an extent, they are right. But this is a film that gives us a harsh, harsh reality that wolverine, has to deal with. He is living in the shadow of his old self. He doesn't have his healing factor, making him incredibly vulnerable both physically and mentally. His physical health is awful, and works as a driver for living. The film is pretty simple in its plot. It's not about a hero in a spandex fight crime, it's about a survivor in a hostile world. Logan is trying to have a normal life but he just can't. He is constantly chased by his past and his animalistic nature, as well as his lone wolf attitude. He doesn't even seem to be happy taking care of his professor. He also meets X-23, played by Dafne Keen, who gives a phenomenal performance despite not given much dialogue. Their relationship is tragic and heartfelt to behold. It is truly tragic that all this time, logan does not care about the child, but when he finally makes a connection, he dies in the most brutal way possible. Seeing x-23 crying over her father was a giant tear jerker thanks to the emotions from these actors that they professionally display.",

I have to disagree on that: the greatness of Logan is that it is brilliant human drama. By comparison, Dark Knight was superficial and forgettable. It had superb cinematography, clever writing, and a standout performance by Ledger. But was there a single moment that pulled at your heartstrings? Was there a message that stayed with you, or made you think? I don't think so. Dark Knight was style over substance. To the extent that it did have a message, it was Nolan's disturbingly neo-conservative view of power and authority (google it - I'm not the first one to notice). Logan, on the other hand - though it also was beautifully shot and expertly crafted, was about substance over style. That's a first for superhero movies. And it's why this film should be the first of its kind (and especially Jackman and Stewart's performances) to be (seriously) recognized by film awards.",

We've had 3 Spider-Mans, 2 Batmans, 2 Supermans, and 3 Hulks on the big screen. Despite all that change, the X-Men universe has remained somewhat intact.

We look at an aged and more vulnerable wolverine and later introduced to an even more vulnerable Charles Xavier. The maturity in terms of language, violence and darkness definitely works well and adds to the realism. The child actress, Laura, who plays Logan's unknown daughter also does a great job. The setting and story line also deserves to be commended as it was a unique look at the world of the X Men. We have gone from the limitless possibilities of the heroes in X Men First Class and Days of Future Past to a more fragile existence for the last remaining mutants. We are informed there are no mutants and Logan and Xavier are possibly the last of their kind. Unlike previous films that have seen Wolverine as a dominant force he is portrayed as a dying and often weak hero who is often on the receiving end. ",

There is simply so much carnage throughout (as well as f-bombs) that it just makes sense for who Wolverine is as a character. Unfortunately, he's dying of old age because of adamantium poisoning (this reminds me of the midi-chlorian revelation in Star Wars Episode I). Sadly - and worst of all - we only get to see Wolverine in his prime for about 5 minutes, and this is only because he takes something that makes him operate at peak level until it wears off. You won't even believe the ending.... ***SPOILER ALERT*** The ending is about as anti-climactic as you can get in this situation. I think it would've been more epic if he walked off into the sunset. He dies saving the girl from the previews (X-23) and some other children. But the way the main baddie is killed doesn't make sense with previous Wolverine movies (which this movie tries to tie together). ***SPOILER ALERT #DOS*** (The main baddie has his head blown off with an adamantium bullet shot from a snub-nosed pistol.

That's when Logan comes into the place. There is no life ending threat to humanity, there are just Logan and those he loves. I liked how the villain can't be called a proper villain, who is just a younger version of Logan himself. The characters are not hilariously powerful, Logan is old and irritated and his actions are lot less destructive than before. And his greatest villain is himself.

For years we've seen wolverine in unrealistic marvel universe films and then for some reason, Marvel try to create a film in the 'real' work almost. And make it more gritty than it needs to be. More gratuitous swearing than we've ever heard in a marvel film too. I'm not prudish, it just felt very forced like they were trying too hard to make a real film/movie instead of their normal mindless fun escapism. Also, what is with the scene when they stay with the black family?! If they know they're being hunted why would they hold up there and put innocent people at risk?! That just annoyed me as it was just so out of character and added nothing to the story line/plot. It also bugged me just how rude and uncaring he was to his kid.

567,27 May 2018,feyipuk,4," Low on subtly, high on slashing","Eighteen years ago, Hugh Jackman met a lonely runaway called Rogue and helped her to ultimately find her place (and his) in the mutant population with the help of Professor X.
Nine years ago he was part of Team X in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, ultimately leading to Weapon XI; Wade Wilson with multiple stolen mutant powers.
Now comes Logan, in which the infamous titular character has become a reclusive limo driver, seemingly spending most of his life caring for an ailing Professor X, when he's approached by a woman who seems to know who he is, and wants him to help her and the girl she's with to get to a safe location.
Unsurprisingly, given the franchise, this ultimately leads to a high body count. What's surprising is, Logan isn't the main cause.
The film does watch like a swan song. Jackman and Stewart have been holding this franchise together for so long they practically are father and son, though given the Wolverines healing abilities you forget who's the older. They are both great actors, able to portray a wide range of emotions as they decline in their twilight years. 
Annoyingly, they're joined on this part of the tale by Caliban (Stephen Merchant), who may have made his name comedically alongside Ricky Gervais, but seems lacking in the gravitas required playing opposite the wracked Jackman and in the situation they are supposedly in.
By contrast, Laura (Dafne Keen) plays the role of brooding misfit with a secret extremely well. Silent for most of the film, she still manages to convey huge amounts of emotion.
The script is probably the weakest part of the film. Going from the previous films, there does seem to be a lack of detail about how they got where they are and the cast aren't very forthcoming about what has gone on. But really the main reason for watching the film are the fight scenes, which may lack the finesse of the previous Wolverine films, but in an era of Disney superheroes, the Wolverine is an adult character that doesn't take prisoners.",

The fact that the movie was close to two and a half hours with no explanation actually made parts painful to watch. Everything is ""mysteriously"" unanswered and even from someone who's usually not bothered by violence, there's a very unnecessary amount ( trust me the origins wolverine is like you're in a kindergarten class playing with dinosaurs compared to it ).

Then when I was driving home, I was still thinking about the movie and it hit me that the entire movie was excellent including the end. If you take Jackson's Wolverine from the beginning in 2000's X-Men to all his movie until 2017's Logan, it's the warrior's journey from dawn to twilight and the ending was a perfect fit to this great warrior and a perfect sendoff to the phenomenal Hugh Jackson who did an excellent job in portraying Logan with so many dimensions. I can tell he had a blast playing Logan over the years, but like Logan coming to terms with his mortality and Jackson dealing his numerous cancer scares over the years, it was time put the claws back in once and for all. I loved this movie. It had a very strong cast. There were no weak links. The little girl who portrayed Laurie was amazing. Not only did she kick-butt as a little Wolverine herself in some brutal action scenes, but she was able to emote so many emotions without speaking and you cared and sympathized with her character. My favorite scene was when she was eating cereal so calmly watching the bad guys on camera arriving to kidnap her. This movie was also a wonderful sendoff to Sir Patrick Stewart. I watched on the Graham Norton as he announced seating next to Hugh Jackson that this would be his last X-Men movie. He said it was perfect sendoff to his character and he was absolutely correct. I loved this version of Stewart and his father-son relationship with Logan who are like a father-son who obviously loved one another but constantly bicker with one another. Professor X, as I will always call him whether he runs the X-Men school or not, was awesome and his instability with his powers led to some of the best scenes in the movie. I even liked the Albino who took control of his destiny. The movie was excellent. Great script, great villains, great cast, great action scene, great storytelling, and scenes that will rip out your heart and shock you. You care about ever character in the movie even the minor characters. But I really enjoyed this movie and even as another pass, I still am thinking about how great this movie is. It is a perfect sendoff to Logan and Xavier. And yes, it is bittersweet but it was the perfect ending to great characters.",

Now, as I am here writing this review, I just cannot stop thinking how oddly satisfying that movie was. I was glad to see a marvel movie that is SO NOT marvel.

603,3 March 2017,guycorhuo,7, Not the Wolverine movie I wanted to watch,"This is not strictly a superhero's movie. It's more a drama in the Sydney Lumet's Running on empty tradition mixed with a road movie (if you don't consider Running on empty a road movie itself). Obviously there are characters with superpowers or enhanced skills, cyborgs, adamantium claws and telepathic stuff but the action scenes just cover less than a third of the whole movie. Maybe is a more mature movie amid its genre than usual but I felt that it lacks a lot of entertainment. At least the kind of fun I expect from a superhero movie. I recognize the risk that the authors have assumed with this kind of story but I don't find it too original. I didn't like a lot the previous Mangold's Wolverine movie and I disliked Origins but to rank all three from best to worst; 1 The Wolverine, 2 Logan, 3 Origins. I think that they have missed a great opportunity with a really great character. I would have enjoyed much more a Bryan Synger's X Men movie style (but discarding Apocalypse) So Long Hugh Jackman's Wolverine",

617,4 March 2017,claus-51,3," Has a lot of good and a lot of bad. Mostly bad, though","Let me start by saying that I'm keeping myself totally out of the Marvel vs. DC debate. I own every Marvel AND every DC movie ever made (yes, even the old Captain America movies!) and I watch them no matter if they're good or bad. I love superhero movies. And that might be just the thing with this movie - because it doesn't FEEl like a superhero movie. It feels like Mad Max, a huge chase interrupted for a few moments, and then the chase continues, lots of fighting and explosions and gratuitous violence (more than ever before in a Wolverine movie!) but very little character, very little plot and a super-depressing story line that ends up in tragedy. I don't understand the appeal of the new wave of films where heroes have to be portrayed as old and dying people. ""Mr Holmes"", ""Star Wars VII"", ""Logan"" and there's talk of a new Indiana Jones...why not let the heroes remain the heroes they are? They don't get better from being shown as old, bumbling men dying of cancer or Alzheimer's! ""Logan"" is all the things that some people have wanted from Marvel movies for a while now. Dark, gritty, violent, brutal. But at the same time, it's lost the fun. It's lost the thrill of the superhero. It's lost the heart. I have nothing bad to say about the main . Jackman does a good job playing Logan, and Patrick Stewart finally gets to say ""f*ck"" as Professor X. The guy playing the villain is so one dimensional, however, that you will lose sight of him when he turns his side. Donald Pierce in the comic was an industrialist and a member of the Hellfire Club. Here, he's a good with a mechanical hand. What a waste. The fight scenes look good. It's nice to see Jackman go full-out berserker rage Wolverine, and X-23 (even though she's a very bad actress) is good at the fighting stuff. All in all, this is quite literally the first time in years, I've walked out of a superhero movie with this conflicted emotions in my head. It's not horrible like Fan4Stic. It's not fun and wild like Doctor Strange. It's not a good story like Civil War. It's just...kind of a dark letdown.",

621,2 March 2017,jackransom-69832,10, Logan - His Time Has Come,"Saw 'Logan' yesterday it was one of (if not) my host hyped for movies of this year. This is not a typical comic book movie at all and is nothing like any if the X-Men franchise, if it didn't feature the characters of Wolverine, Professor X etc. then it could easily be mistaken as a completely different movie. This film is a dark, depressing, brutally violent drama action movie. The film see's Logan (Hugh Jackman) at the end of his rope, his healing factor is going and the admantium in his body is poisoning him, he's relying on alcohol and drugs to numb the pain, he also now a limo driver for hire to pay for medication of Professor X (Patrick Stewart) who due to his ability is experiencing brain seizures which are affecting everyone around him, he is also being looked after by the mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant). However unexpectedly a young girl (Dafne Keen) (I won't spoil who she is and why) enters Logan's life and we find out she is being hunted by a group called 'The Reavers' led by Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) and this leads into a chase/road movie spread over the 2hrs 17 mins. The acting in this movie is brilliant, this seals the fact that no-one can replace Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, this is his best portrayal of the character and seeing go full berserker mode was one of the coolest things I've ever seen on screen, Patrick Stewart is as good as you'd expect as Charles Xavier he's becoming more insane and reacting to the drugs which is affecting his behaviour, also hearing both him and Logan drop the f- bomb didn't feel wrong or forced because it shows just how sick they are of everything that's happened. This is Dafne Keen's first movie and she is also brilliant, it's not often like 6 or 7 year old girl can be menacing but she acts this part really well and she works well with Logan & Xavier, for me the most unexpected casting was Stephen Merchant as Caliban, however it works really well he's sarcastic, creepy and it's interesting seeing Merchant in a non- comedic role. Last Boyd Holbrook plays Pierce well, he is a menacing and threatening villain and immediately dislikeable (which is the point). This film is R-Rated/15 for a reason, honestly seeing those claws slashing throats, stabbing heads, chopping limbs was incredible, it's what I've wanted to see my whole life, these action scenes are brutal and grounded and as the director said no CGI is featured. 'Logan' is the wolverine film I've always wanted to see and is nothing like any other comicbook movie.",

This film works as a fond farewell and an entirely standalone, non-cannon story; it is rich in humour, subtlty, meaning and emotion. Few films have left me as affected. We will always want more, we will always want things to be different, but we need to learn to be okay with enough.",
627,14 June 2017,sethray,4," I'm sorry, but while excellent acting","Because it is part of long-running franchise, however, it comes across as painfully incongruous with previous X-Men movies. At the outset of the movie, we see that Logan has descended once again into misery, so all of the gains made in ""The Wolverine"" are lost. Once again also, mutants are on the edge of extinction, so all gains made in ""Days Of Future Past"" are lost (and less than 10 years later, to add to the bewilderment). Basically, it looks like some writer liked the idea of rebooting the mutant doomsday concept of DOFP and taking it in a bleaker direction.",
628,2 September 2020,alexnielsen-98723,9, A great movie over all,This movie I came in with lower expectations due to so much hype. This movie totally blew away my expectations. The movie does so well by showing us a older Wolverine that isn't a invincible superhero. Charles Xavier has gone mentally insane which makes you really feel bad for these characters. To many marvel movies show invincible superheroes. The death sequences are top notch. A amazing ending to Wolverine. All the actors and actresses are amazing. Highly recommend.,

I'm not going to discuss much of the story-line or spoilers here because its better you go and discover yourself what a gem it is. I never thought of writing a review of all those hundreds of films that I have seen but Logan compelled me to write one.There are two reasons for that.First I am a lifelong X- Men fan and Second- This was a rare movie that does justice to Wolverine.So be assured and go watch it before anyone else.A happy Farewell to Mr.Hugh Jackman.",

632,18 March 2017,eagandersongil,8, The dark side of Marvel,"""Logan"" has created a gigantic expectation, and managed to overcome, a film of superhuman hero that you will see in life, with characters that go beyond your healing factor or claws, but rather characters who think, suffer and leave the box . ""Logan"" sacrifices a little of the dynamics and the factor of impressing in exchange for metaphors in his script, he is very good at not only creating an extremely charismatic character from scratch like Laura, but also in giving a three-dimensionality to Logan, since now he Is no longer a simple anti-hero, he is also hero, father, son and human, and also spectacular use of Xavier and the clever way Calliban is used, pity that for the villains the script does not have a room of the same care, We have a first definite act, a second that mingles with the third - which is very short - and obvious, full of reference to the other films in the saga, we see the story of Logan, a completely discredited mutant who constantly thinks about death, until A new hope arises, we have all the call of the hero, but it is that cliché of beginning that in the end surprises, and much. We have a photograph that has even westerns, always pulling for a warmer palette, a good soundtrack, although it leaves the country just for the credits, the set up is good and the way James Mangold uses the open plan is great, especially In the scene where Logan carries Xavier in his arms. In terms of acting, my favorite in the film is Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, even in a wheelchair, he is completely wonderful and at certain times until the rhythm of the film, Hugh Jackman is also great as always, and Daphne Keen owns a gigantic charisma even though his face is always closed, and congratulations to James Mongold, who has recovered from immortal Wolverine and did a great job. Obviously the movie is not perfect, far from it, using a clone of Logan reminds us of every philosophical question of his struggle being the interior, and I love it, but to the great public this sounds like laziness and even breaks the Rhythm, and the fact that the film follows a recipe created by himself also bugs a little, but his daring to show violence, kill without mercy, the animalistic way as Laura struggles, Logan having to stop for breath, are details that Composes the work and greatly diminishes its defects, ""Logan"" is a worthy film for both comic book lovers and the general public.",

635,15 May 2017,cassielPrice,9, Honestly it was a great ending for a superhero,"Logan, as we know, is a highly rich character in personality and background knowledge we know about him. Hugh Jackman, he has done his best in this movie I could easily believe his suffering and acting because he is drowned and became one with his role.Actually, the movie and the story had the certain smell of death since the beginning. When I was watching the first minutes of the movie the scenes and the locations also had been chosen wisely they could inform us of the death, of a dramatic ending. I could see regret in Logan's eyes he is like that's enough of heroic life just let me rest in peace I don't want to fight anymore. As a fan, I've never seen him running away from his enemies he just wanted to stay away from any stress for the rest of his life.He was hopeless until Laura came in he could barely see himself in the girl so he sacrificed himself for saving her.It's hard to describe how dramatic how beautiful the scenario was the love between a father and his daughter.This time we saw a different Logan there was no glory and fighting will in him he was calm he knew it is time for him to go.After all Marvel movies have lost a legend I don't know if its possible to bring him back on the scene because Logan is still alive in comics. I can't write more here the movie is so good that you can talk about its positive points for a whole day.",

Its worth watching more than twice (if you have a free 2hrs slot). LOGAN is packed with action, drama and unexpected twists. It portrayed the life struggles of the Wolverine (Logan) and Professor X that I can connect with and able to understand their pain that they had to go through as the last remaining mutants in the world. The action scenes were violent, realistic, and graphically detailed unlike the previous PRE-2011 X- men movies which were more suitable for younger audiences. To me, this should be the standard of most X-men/ Wolverine movies one that portrays real-life struggle, pain, emotional hardship, mental suffering, and graphic death scenes. I also like how they use classic X-men comics to demonstrate the differences of real world X-men and fictional figures. A very good closure for both Professor X and Wolverine.",

642,24 July 2017,hacantyapradipta,10, An excellent swan song for the longest-tenured superhero.,"This review contains spoilers, click expand to view. Well, it's not really a spoiler if we all know Logan's gonna be dead by the end of the movie, huh? But that's not really the only spoiler. Prof. X is dead too. And hell, this is one depressing superhero movie. A disabled 90-something man with brain disease being kept in a huge tank by another old, ailing man on Mexico-US border, with both being chased by the government. And to make it even more depressing, Logan dies holding his heart in his hand (That 2013's The Wolverine prophecy). If Deadpool brought something new to the genre with tons of swearing, blood, violence, and nudity, Logan is one of those superhero film you can call ""dark"" and ""adult-only"". It's full of amazing actions, drama, and acting. Both Jackman and Stewart deserve an Oscar nod (But unfortunately, I don't see it happening). In my opinion, this is the best superhero movie since The Dark Knight. And that says a lot, considering my unconditional love for MCU movie.",

The acting is top notch from all of the cast members. The movie has everything including: action, drama, comedy, tragedy, strong moral lessons, etc. The characters are much more down-to-earth and realistic. This is the most realistic ""superhero"" film that I have ever seen; as realistic as you can be in a world full of amazing powers anyway. If this movie does not win an Oscar or Golden Globe award, then something is definitely wrong. You will not regret going to see this movie because it has everything that you could want in a movie. Just be prepared to shed a few tears, because this movie is quite tragic. I grew up watching the X-Men movies, so this one really touched me.

Each and every wolverine movie done has him with some sorta problem with his healing factor. They neuter him for some reason. Wolverine without his healing factor is just some dude with claws. What's the point? Now in Logan, his powers are on the fritz and he's an old man. Yeah just what I wanted to pay to see in the theatre. Take Deadpool for example, he has a healing mutant factor, you don't see any movie with Deadpool in it with problems with his healing factor...so why do they keep doing it to the Wolverine...didn't Deadpool movies make a boat load of money? The only redeeming quality is his daughter/female clone. She is a better wolverine then wolverine ever was in movies, better at fighting, personality, they should've just made the movie about her instead. Though they probably neuter her too and take away her healing x factor if it came to that because they want to make a mutant movie without them having mutant powers? I dunno, so disappointed with this movie but worth the watch. Damn I forgot, even the clone wolverine at the end was a better wolverine then the actual wolverine. They screwed up the Reavers too, they were cyborgs, half machine to mostly machines with Lady Deathstrike which she was not part of in the movie. Hopefully Marvel's reboot into the MCU will fix the X-men and their characters.",

The whole movie lacked any kind of flow from any of the previous movies. We are dropped off sometime in the future where mutants are all but gone. Professor X is cursing every other word as is Logan. Now in the previous movies, Wolverine does slash and kill people, but in this movie he goes straight for the face and brain, etc. I believe that for the lack of a plot, they fill in the gaps with swearing and blood.

660,15 March 2017,mclong2009,9," Great movie, uncomfortably real","Hats off to director and screenwriter James Mangold for putting a real- life, gritty spin on the Marvel Universe. The film is about as real as you could ever expect a comic-book movie to be. Anyone who has seen an elder suffer from the effects of dementia can appreciate Mr. Stewart's performance and the interaction between he and Wolverine. And the young actress who plays Laura is incredible, her character's edge makes the movie tick. I just hope we don't read about her 20 years from now, her life spiraling downhill. I can't see how a young person can't be hugely affected by these roles.

It was hard to take comics seriously, but Singer brought the X-men, a team of superheroes that faced problems not many other heroes face (that being discrimination) to the big screen in a grand sort of way. An allegory for the struggle many minorities, especially the LGBT+ people, face in the real world, audiences empathised both with Charles Xavier's pursuit of protection of the Mutants, and the education of the masses that these Mutants aren't as bad and scary as they may seem at first, and Magneto's pursuit of vengeance against the people who abused him almost his entire life.",

It's dark, violent and emotional. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart both deserve to be nominated Oscars for their performances which was outstanding and newcomer Dafne Keen made an impressive acting debut as Laura Kinney/X-23 and she was fantastic in the part. The film was pretty hard to watch and the world of Logan was really dark and depressing and it shows you how cruel life and the world is, especially how bad the world in real life has gotten and how much rubbish people like Donald Trump, the drug lords, corrupt politicians and terrorists are giving to the world. However, I was real confused about if the film took place in the original or the reset time-line. I am glad Deadpool didn't appear in the film or made a cameo, he would had ruined it. If you plan on going to see Logan, I strongly advise that you bring tissues with you to the cinema, the real gets really emotional. Hugh Jackman gives the farewell you will never forget.",

If you have seen more than five movies you could see from a mile away it was gonna come in play later. ",
674,27 March 2017,eden-rabatsch,9, Children of X Men - a fitting finale for The Wolverine,"When you have seen the world imperilled by blue lasers shooting into the sky for the millionth time and motley crews of superheroes destroy as much of the city as they save, we finally get a film that looks at what the humanity of being a superhero feels like. In so doing, James Mangold has created a masterpiece. ""Logan"" is the third film in the Wolverine trilogy but depending on the count, the 10th film that Wolverine has appeared in the X Men universe.In saying that, this film gains all the history and the depth that the viewer feels in seeing an actor like Hugh Jackman playing the same character for 17 years. This is important. When the film scales down to a relatively small gritty story one of the reasons it can operate so lean is that a lot of the hard exposition has already been done. It allows the film to focus on story and character and to do so beautifully. The setup is that it is the year 2029 and Logan is succumbing to years of adamantium poisoning. Despite his healing factor, he is slowly succumbing to the effects. Holed up with Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Caliban (Stephen Merchant) they try to make ends meet and prevent Professor X's telepathic power ravaging the world as he slips into dementia. We also realise that it has been 25 years since the last mutant was born. As a species they are facing extinction. Logan is called upon to protect some children who were genetically altered to create a new form of X Men. However, they were an interim step to a wholly born lab creation, the X 24. One of these children needs protection and it soon becomes apparent that Laura (Dafne Keen) has a much more personal connection then first thought. James Mangold co-writes and directs and if you know Mangold's filmography the difference between the works he has written and the ones he just directs is light and day (I nearly wrote Knight and Day, one of his poor directing efforts). Mangold scales down the action but ups the reality - for the first time you see what those claws on a superhuman fighting machine would actually do to a human body. Mangold has taken direct inspiration from westerns, in fact there is a whole in film homage to ""Shane"", and that is the boldness of this film. It smashes the genre because it tells a story which could be told in a million ways but with superheroes, thus avoiding many of the usual clichés. If anything, it is when it falls back on them that the film missteps, such as the second act event when they take refuge at a ranch. The action which follows is not as resonant because we have not had time to connect with these characters. Jackman was born to play Logan/The Wolverine and being brave enough to show his degradation and every wrinkle just adds to it. Stewart is brilliant as Professor X and if this was November, it would not be too much hyperbole to think Academy Award. Caliban is a character I have seen a few incarnations but Merchant makes him his own and steals every scene he is in. But, ultimately the real star is Dafne Keen as Laura/X 23 who is amazing as li'l Wolverine. The attitude and physicality she exhibits is exhilarating. I only hope they make a sequel and allow her to bridge this to a more mature career. There is a resonance in this film that is beyond X Men. A film set in 2029 which opens on boorish Americans heckling Mexicans as they try to cross the US border and The Wall that Trump finally built, sets up a feeling of despair beyond the X Men dying off, like the great westerns it marks that the US is also withering away. It is why it is no fluke, that the next generation of superheroes are all born of Mexican mothers. Mangold is making a statement of what happens to cultures who don't embrace change. The closest analogue is the great Eastwood western ""Unforgiven"" in which at some point all the violence must present a price but I also loved the echoes of Children of Men. Great and interesting films often have lots of mothers and that is the case here. It is no exaggeration to say that this is not only the best X Men film ever but arguably competing with ""The Dark Knight"" for greatest superhero film of all time.",

(riff off the BRILLIANT convenience store scene, 49:00 mark)","As a stand-alone entry in the series, as a swan song for what was arguably the best ever character in X-Men, as props for Jackman's superb and consistently excellent portrayal of the character, the film is above average. But you need context. Context as in, the very first entry was nearly perfect, and in fact made my IMDb list of all-time nearly perfect films (see below). As in, both Marvel and Disney have a nasty habit of killing off characters that Stan Lee spent his entire life building, cherishing, and protecting. Is this what our throw-away culture has come to? If you look at the 2022 release of Pinocchio, which reboots the 1940 original, you will see that even poor Jiminy Cricket has a longer shelf life than a Marvel hero.

The movie had a number of epic and thrilling scenes with a few touching and sad moments. It was good to see Patrick Stewart come back as Professor X. It was a great send off for the character Wolverine. Overall, Logan is a thrilling action-packed ride with sad moments and a ton of gore.

I gotta give all my respect to Dafne Keen and her amazing act as X-23(Laura) as she did an outstanding role considering her age. This is by far the best Marvel movie ever did and every fan of X-men should see it. I was touched when Logan dies and seeing Laura bursting in tears for this man that she had known for just a week.

Performances are mostly strong (not sure I feel that way about Patrick Stewart) but the plot is convoluted and choppy, hard to follow, and the ultimate ending is massively disappointing. It starts well enough with previous characters having fallen on hard times but like the 2013 Wolverine movie it descends into an utterly ridiculous plot which i'm not sure I can even describe here - suffice it to say (SPOILERS) that the last 1/3 is like watching MadMax Beyond Thunderdome with kids living in a treehouse before trying to make it across the border (Canadian) to a rumored Eden. It is hyper violent which would not be a problem except the movie introduces lots of sympathetic characters - kids (lots), families, maternal types, then kills most of them in disturbing ways with little rhyme or reason. We once again get an endless supply of gov't mercenaries as the meaningless bad guys then kill them one by one with lots of killing being done by a banshee-like screaming child. I wanted to turn it off but I was already an hour and 45 minutes in and thought I would finish it - not a good decision.",

I was actually very surprised that the movie had a story frame. Of course it is a fictional movie but has much more real elements that makes in more believable, much more grown up and mature. The Logan character was deeper, more life like and the whole story has some neat details which makes it a good movie. Of course Patrick Stewart was very good. The movie itself is very well directed and has plenty things going on and it leaves you with a feeling that movie is very long. Which it actually is with over 2h and 10m long. There could have been less fighting, but the director probably had to follow guidelines to make it more action like. Besides X-Men: First class which was great and X-Men: Days of Future Past which fell somehow behind the first one, Logan is the only X-men movie I like.

This one was miserable, sad for no reason and inaccurate. Why did they even had to call it Logan? They should have named it John or Mark or whatever else because this had nothing to do with a superheroe we loved through Xmen.

697,2 March 2017,tyleramato-28680,9, No country for old muties,"Back in the late 90's, 20th Century Fox cast an unknown Broadway singer to play one of comic's most violent and beloved characters in 2000's live action adaptation of the popular X-Men comics created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, a casting which was met with much scrutiny, similar to the kind Warner Bros. received when they announced that comedic actor Michael Keaton would be dawning the cape and cowl in 1989's ""Batman"" directed by Tim Burton...well it's now 2017 and both are considered by many to be the best actors to grace the screen as these characters, difference being that Hugh Jackman has lasted as this character for over 10(!) years, appearing in 9 films in the acclaimed X-Men franchise. ""Logan"" is the supposed final appearance by Hugh Jackman as The Wolverine, and if that is indeed the case, he went out with one hell of a bang. ""Logan"" is unlike any comic book movie that has ever come before it, its real, gruesome, unapologetic take on the genre is commendable, but most importantly of all, it has a big, hefty heart that it wears proudly on its sleeve, it's an emotionally gripping film that provides genuine surprises, this is a comic book film where no one, I repeat, no one is safe from the grasp of death, which is another commendable trait of this film. Hugh Jackman makes the most of his final outing as The Wolverine, delivering his most refined performance as the character, other series vet Patrick Stewart and newcomer Daphne Keen are excellent as well here. ""Logan"" proves that there is much more room for growth in the crowded superhero genre.",
698,21 March 2017,gogarrett,7," Major violence, foul language and sadness abounds","I read a few other reviews and cannot imagine how this movie could be called a beautiful swan song for Logan or Xavier. Logan is a grumpy old alcoholic with lethal tendencies who is soured by the horrors of his life. The story in this movie confirms that he has good reason to be this way. It was not my kind of comic book material. I only give it a 7 because it wasn't horrible as a movie. Just really over the top with swearing and horrific reality-based violence compared with other X- Men movies. I rate it less than other X-Men movies because the mutant powers are not shown as much as I think they could have been, other than the heavy use of claws. For example - Caliban was a pretty important character and I don't feel we really ever knew what his mutant power was. Certainly it wasn't just being sensitive to sunlight.",

700,9 March 2017,matthewssilverhammer,9, A Fond Farewell to a Ferocious Friend,"2013's Wolverine saw Jackman's clawed curmudgeon join forces with Hollywood-heavyweight Mangold for some brooding fun that was decidedly more down-to-earth. Back together for Logan, Mangold has not only kept his distinct strengths of tone and combat, but has ramped up the quality & gravitas rarely seen in a blockbuster. In one of the most brutally and beautifully made superhero films of all-time, Logan gives audiences an experience full of gasps, laughs, and thrills& buckets of blood. Taking place in the near-future, we find our invincible anti-hero trying to live a quiet life, driving a limo, and taking care of his dangerously senile father-figure Xavier; yet his world is far from boring, especially when a girl with familiar powers appears. The emotional anchor here is the Logan / Charles relationship; watching them deal with weakening bones, a changing world and oncoming dementia is powerfully relatable. However, the action is far from dormant. Keen is a fantastic mutant newcomer, grunting and fighting in ways that Logan himself doesn't have the virility for anymore. Instead, he lumbers through his fights with vicious intensity and careless selflessness. And when I say ""vicious"", I mean ""vicious""; this is NOT your kids X-Men. The R-rated door Deadpool knocked down has allowed Logan to violently dance on the other side. If you've ever felt like Wolverine's claws and fury felt neutered in a PG-13 world, fear no more. However, the violence is to a purpose; we're shown the difficult effects in honest and effective ways, especially in the jarring use of children. All-in-all, it's a perfect send-off for one of the most successful character / actor collaborations in movie history, and is far-and-away the greatest X-Men film yet.",

With the exception of Magneto, these mutants are a pretty forgettable bunch. They have a host of generic superpowers and equally unremarkable personalities. King of this bunch is the Wolverine. This character dominated the core franchise and spinoffs, ripping enemies to pieces in PG-13 glory. But even after a half a dozen movies this antihero never really grew beyond the loner among rejects persona. Honestly, the only character-centric scene I remember is a dialogue free montage of the immortal warrior fighting in American wars. I have seen enough movies that I know after the first twenty minutes rarely do things change for the better. By this standard, Logan (the 8th film featuring the Wolverine) is a miracle.",

His powers are Adamantiun claws and skeleton and a mutant healing factor which is now reduced due to time. He's not the warrior at his prime. He's now a limousine driver. Helping his former teacher Charles Xavier(Patrick Stewart), who now has to take medicine because of psychic seizures he suffers. 
But in the midway of the situation, there's another mutant with the same ability as Logan. It's Laura, aka X-23. The only difference is that she has 2 claws on each hand and one claw on each foot. But don't count Logan out, he can still fight. 
When he worked as a limousine driver, he did his job well. He handled himself well when one of the passengers flashed him. Logan wasn't such an absentee father, at least it wasn't Daken.
Violence and action was non-stop in this film. And that X-24 was more menacing. Logan is a warrior to the end. 
Nothing else can match the tenacity Logan can bring.

The action is super brutal and the narrative is interesting. We have an aging wolverine on the run from theses goons called Reapers with Charles Xavier and a cloned daughter named Laura and making a decision to put down the animal or to control it. Hugh jackman sells it here in his final role and the development is really good. The villains were so so and Xavier was kind of a jerk when he got some people in danger for his own selfishness.

However, a story is only elevated by its actors, and they did not disappoint. Daphne Keen will be the next big action star in Hollywood, mark my words. Her performance as Laura, aka X23 was nuanced and physically brilliant. The decision for her to use predominantly Spanish goes back to the actresses roots, and works brilliantly. Hugh Jackman makes the most of his last outing as Wolverine, and delivers a rage fueled, but tender (in some places) performance. The big man himself, Sir Patrick Stewart was also convincing, and he delivered his last lines with such emotion and pain, that one can only sit still and watch in horror, knowing what's about to happen. My only problem was the villain. He was very one dimensional, and while his plan was properly terrifying, his lines weren't written with any depth. However, I believe that if you are looking for something with a dark knight esque feel, look no further than this. Logan is a complete and powerful film, that will stick with you for a long time.",

In the year 2000 X-Men was released and stunned audiences with creating well- rounded, dynamic characters. It showed that a comic book movie could be more than just campy. 2004's Spider-Man 2 took that even further by creating what I still say is in the top 10 comic book movies ever. It delved deep into the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and it served as a great character movie. The Dark Knight elevated the comic book movie to an entirely new level that may never be surpassed. It took the camp and silliness that usually fills those movies and instead told a serious and gritty crime movie. It essentially was a crime drama that so happened to have Batman.

The acting was really good, especially Hugh Jackman's acting. That movie was a nice conclusion about Wolverine's storyline. The ending scene was unexpected and it was kinda emotional.",

The casting in both movies are excellent. The acting performances in both movies are excellent. Both movies build to the climax, i.e., both movies elevate the tension until the end in memorable fashion. Furthermore, Logan varies from Deadpool because Logan takes a more gritty and real world undertone whereas Deadpool is more comedic and still feels in the realm of a superhero movie. Logan is unique.

I can not say that it is a waste of time or money to watch it at the cinema, but the film is nott good, it is not bad either, it is just moderate, just another action cliché movie that meets no more than 65% of my total respect. H.J. plays Wolverine as he used us, so perfect I mean. If it wasn't for him, I don't know how it could be. The final X-Men movie is so boring and commercial, with some, I have to agree, good scenes. Good, not memorable, not perfect ! The filming angles are so...ordinary...Not a single scene was shot from a different good angle so that it may stay in my memory or something. It was filmed just like another commercial film... The first half of the film made me think this requires no more than a 6 rate, but the other half was better, in other words, for my point of view, the action and the thrill both started about when they met those farmers and so on. I don't know, it is my opinion, but the end started to be epic, I mean the chase in the woods, just like the first Wolverine film started (I was thinking wow they had a brilliant idea, ending it the same how it started, with Logan running in the forest and fighting some soldiers, but the scene with him being buried by children was very embarrassing for such a hero as Wolverine). Another big issue that may have changed my opinion and could have made this film better was that it has almost no good music in fighting/drama scenes... To end, I can say that Logan is about on the 3th, maybe even on the 4th place on my X-men films list.",

I felt as if I had joined a movie mid showing as everything was like already a story line in progress and no one had bothered to introduce said story lines. I left the theater feeling as if all they wanted was to get my money one last time. What they state in the preview is the ENTIRE movie, no need to watch it, it dragged very slowly during much of the film. at one point I left to go to the bathroom, got back and still nothing had changed, no action, no nothing but another slow scene. And to add this was set in the late 2020s? I thought from the last movie there was a teaser set near the same time when Professor X and Magneto came for Logan at an airport. what happened there? is this a prequel? many many more questions arose rather than answer. If this is in fact a prequel, than this fact will make me want to wait till all episodes are in and watch them in entirety then maybe it'll make sense. As it is this wasn't very well written and they writers did little to no homage to the previous X-Men franchise movies. They left out completely what had happened other than a reference or 2 to an ""event"". I don't know I felt like it wasn't worth a theater show, straight to DVD maybe but not a huge success IMO.",

However, the plot felt like it had less to do with these fantastic mutant abilities and more about just living life as normal people. Don't get me wrong: there are plenty of mutant abilities on display in this film, it's just that they weren't necessarily the focus of it. In fact, if you took away the fact that this was based on comic book characters, you'd still have a film about a father trying to care for a daughter he never knew he had.

Logan isn't really a superhero film. It is a character film. Logan is a super complex character that I had the pleasure of growing up with. Hugh Jackman ends his Wolverine career on such a high note! The action is superb with addition of the R rated violence. Normally I would be against any PG-13 super hero movie that wasn't already an R taking such a rating. Logan proved me wrong. Wolverine is a character that had no problem taking it to the next level. It blew my mind. We are now in the golden age of superhero movies. It's movies like this that prove that with fresh ideas and great characters that this genre of film isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Acting standouts are Hugh Jackman (of course), Patrick Stewart (also in his final X-men appearance), and Dafne Keen. It's a shame that this wasn't nominated for more awards. It would have won Best Picture, Best Actor, & Best Supporting Actor in my opinion. I hope more superhero movies take note and take more risks like this one. I highly recommend.",

769,4 March 2017,ransomclarke-46236,6, Come on folks... It's not a 10/10,"I don't know what everyone's seeing in this movie that makes them think its such a masterpiece. Everyone's giving it 9's and 10's, but I'd give it a 6-7 at best. A 10/10 should only be reserved for a film that is flawless in every way -- whether it be acting, directing, cinematography, story and everything in-between. For it to be perfect, the story has to be gripping throughout the 140 minute run time, and that's where I felt it was weakest. It's serviceable, but it isn't perfect. I have a feeling that the people who are giving this film perfect scores are doing so because its much grittier than any X-Men movie in the past. It's definitely savage with the violence, which was refreshing to me and I appreciated them going all-out with the hard R rating. It starts out freaking great when it's setting up the overall plot, but then it REALLLLY drags along for the 90+ minutes in the middle. During the second act, the story spent so much time focusing on little moments with minimal significance to the overall arc, that I found myself feeling really underwhelmed when the big emotional moments finally happened. Don't expect to be heavily invested in the villains either... they're given very little development on screen, and as soon as any meaningful dialogue starts happening to give the audience some exposition into what's been going on for the last 20+ years in this universe, it comes to an abrupt stop. If you're looking for action, you will be happy with the beginning and the end. Other than that, it's nothing more than a mediocre country western style ""road movie"" about Logan and the girl. I also left with more questions than I had going into it, which I'm assuming will be told through a new series of prequels. Overall, it was a so-so experience that wouldn't be getting such high scores if it weren't for the fact that it's an R-rated X-Men movie.",

Logan has in the 5years since the events of 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' become such a freeking panzy. He is like a neutered little kitten... instead of killing the executives and heads of the corporation (Transigen) that is responsible for spreading an anti-mutant virus and perhaps undoing the massive damage that Transigen has caused, Logan instead chooses to be a freeking limo driver living on scraps and dealing drugs to get money on the side...

It's the second Marvel movie which has a R rating(?), and Deadpool just went over-top-the-fricking-top with it, great bloody action and a lot of swearing which benefited the movie. so, I thought, Great, Wolverine can finally shred some goons in a bloody fashion, ever play'd the video game ""X-Men Origins Wolverine""? then you know what i'm talking about. But unfortunately the endresult is far from what I expected. Yes, it's a much slower and realistic approach to the whole super human topic, with feelings and stuff, but i wasn't really into it. SPOILER AHEAD!!!! and when I saw the little child Wolverine, that just made me laugh. there should be no kids in this movie! and it's way too many of them anyway. it's like the last entry in the ""old"" Mad Max Trilogy, when Max helps the little shits in the plane. Like, Yeah, he's a good guy, he redeem'd himself, he helps kids now. I rather watch ""The Wolverine"" unrated again and wait impatiently for ""Deadpool 2"". so long.. 5/10",
805,24 March 2017,davidgee,8, Wolverine and Mini-Me,"This is Hugh Jackman's widely announced 'swansong' as Wolverine/Logan, the mutant with adamantine knives in his knuckles. As the movie opens, he seems more mortal than super-hero, care-worn, drinking too much, driving a stretch limo near the Mexican border to pay for the meds desperately needed by ailing Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). A young girl, Laura, arrives in their lives, pursued by mutant- hunters: she's a Mini-Me version of Wolverine, possessed of similar talons and talents. Logan gets his 'mojo' back and he and Laura fight off the first wave of hunters. But there are more where they came from, directed by a Frankensteinian doctor (Richard E. Grant) in whose lab the girl was created, along with a Terminator version of Wolverine. The rest of the movie is chase and run, fight and run – pretty much the standard fare of the X-MEN franchise. The fight scenes, of which there are many, are fairly visceral with now four sets of blades chopping up the baddies.",
806,18 March 2017,jasonsharden,10, This Is How Hero-Flicks Are Done,"""Logan"" is the hero-flick we've all been begging Hollywood to make. It's visceral, honest, and uses the R rating not to exploit it, but to carry the story in ways that resemble that of the graphic novels these films are based off of. The characters feel organic and relatable despite their mutant abilities, and the action they get thrown into, though graphic and entertaining, don't come off as a distraction, but rather drive the story and provide growth for its characters. The acting is the BEST I've seen for a movie of this kind, with Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart reprising their respective roles and giving the most passionate performance they can give, but the real MVP is the young and talented Dafne Keen. Her character is full of complexities, yet she plays this character with such ease as if she were born to be X-23. The film is beautifully written, with each element dedicated to telling this difficult story with as much grit and soul as a Western. This is how it's done, Disney.",

Logan tells a gripping, yet depressing tale about the fall of the X-Men and Logan's attempt to adjust to the world around him. The movie does not glorify superheroes, but in fact portrays the world as it is; grim, evil and oppressing. Whereas most superhero movies contain the general, hero's journey plot, with a more positive tone (sometimes to the point of absurdity), Logan disregards the common tropes, breaking most of the rules common to superhero movies, and it does so with great success. Truthfully, Logan cannot and shall not be deemed as ""a superhero movie"", as the focus of it lies not in the superpowers of the main character or the collaboration between characters in flashy costumes and red capes (yes, The Avengers, I'm taking about you) to achieve a common goal of defeating the typical bad guy. Instead, focus lies in such aspects as visual storytelling, strong character development and realistic relationships, as well as realistic portrayal of the world. In a few words, without spoiling the plot, Logan is mainly about a broken man, oppressed and persecuted by the world around him and about his transformation from a broody, ruined Logan, into a respectable and caring person, showing that even the most broken of people have a bright side to them. Fortunately, that is where the lighthearted tone ends, as the movie quickly transforms into the gripping, grim tale it is. The R rating given to this movie only supports the point it is trying to make, and is not for the faintest of heart. Logan's realistic portrayal of the world we live in as well as Logan himself sets this movie apart from many movies I have seen, and especially its superhero ""competition"". There is enjoyment to be found for both dedicated fans and casual viewers, although I strongly recommend viewing every movie in the X-Men universe before viewing this, as this movie marks an end to the series (so far), at least timeline wise, as it is Hugh Jackman's very last performance as Logan, and the movie thus acts as a perfect and fitting closure for his long, developed story. While X-Men fans will enjoy the movie more, casual viewers will find it enjoyable too due to the fact that the story is self-contained and sparsely based on and related to previous films, making the story quite easy to understand and follow, without prior exposure to the X-Men universe. Overall, this is a great movie about a realistic depiction of the world around us and how even the most broken people can redeem themselves. This movie gets 8 out of 10 starts from me, which places it in the 250 best movies of all time, and that is an achievement to be proud of. It does not get higher rating because although however great it is, it isn't the greatest movie of all time and cannot and shall not be compared to the likes of The Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption, arguably two of the best movies of all time.

If you like the x men movies and the wolverine movies then you will love Logan. Dafne Knee was amazing as the role of Laura. I saw it in IMAX and it filled the whole screen with amazing quality footage. The whole movie was one of those movies where you know it is going to be good, but it even surprises you of how good it is that is what Logan does.",
809,9 May 2022,jacksongaming-80094,10, An heartbreaking yet satisfying conclusion,Logan is the most mature the X-Men franchise has ever been. It's depressing and extremely heart breaking seeing everyone's childhood hero dying inside like that. This film hits all the emotions and is absolutely one of the best superhero films ever made. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are on the top of their games as always. The Professor X seizure scenes were extremely well directed as well as the action sequences which benefits heavily with the R rated tag .And the father-daughter dynamic of Logan and his daughter hits the right tones. This movie has one of the most saddest yet satisfying ending to any superhero film and is absolutely deserving of all the prase it gets.,
810,26 May 2017,paytonsapp,9, Spoiler Free Review: Logan (With Thoughts on Logan Noir),"Before I share my thoughts on 'Logan Noir' I will first talk about the pros and cons of the theatrical cut of Logan. Out of all the films I've seen this year, Logan is probably my 2nd favorite (only behind A Monster Calls). This film has it all: Action, Drama, Comedy, ACTION, Etc. This was easily my most anticipated film of the year as I am a huge fan of the X-Men franchise and the character of Logan/Wolverine is one of my favorite characters of all time. While we can all agree that X-Men Origins was a disaster, I felt a lot of people were to hard on The Wolverine (2013). There were a lot of things to love about that film and I thought it was the first film in the X-Men franchise to actually get the character of Wolverine right. However there was still things missing. And everything that was missing in The Wolverine, Logan makes up for in a huge way. This film is damn near flawless, as far as super-hero movies go, and this is in my humble opinion, the best Marvel film to date. It is also the only other super-hero movie you could compare to The Dark Knight trilogy, this also being my opinion. Hugh Jackman gives one of his best performances and easily the best performance he's given in an X-Men film. He brings so much vulnerability to the character and you can see and totally feel his pain. Hugh Jackman is without a doubt the only actor who should ever play this character. Sir Patrick Stewart also is very good in the film. Charles Xavier is a very hurt and very sad man in Logan, I think Stewart really portrays Xavier as that hurt man very very well. You really feel both Xavier and Logans pain through out he entire run time of the film and it makes them the most vulnerable they have been during the entire franchise. However, the biggest surprise in the entire film for me, was Dafne Keen as Laura. This girl has an incredibly bright future and I pray that they allow her to carry on the torch as this totally new character instead of casting someone else as Wolverine because she really is incredible in this role and brings a savageness but at the same time a heartbreaking innocence as well. Bottom line, The whole cast really is incredible throughout the entire film. The camera work and overall production design is also fantastic. This is probably the best looking X-Men film to date hands down. There is little CG in the film but what is in the film looks pretty good. It didn't take me out of the story at all and I didn't really notice much. Except for a short 20 second moment where the CG is very noticeable, but again it didn't take me out of the story. Logan is a perfect send off for Hugh Jackman from the X-Men franchise and although it's very bittersweet, this is the way it should have all wrapped up for him. And in the end...",

This is the only good X-Men movie as far as I can tell. It had a good story with good acting and good action. If you want to watch a great movie, watch Logan.

In the actual comic-book story of Logan's fight with The Reavers, he gets crucified and left for dead; too much?

835,2 March 2017,bear_adam,10, A Majestic Seranade To All Fans.,"I will start by saying that this is my new all time favorite superhero film ever created and this is the first time it has changed since the 2002 version of Spider-Man. I mean ""Logan"" had it all. The story takes place in the year 2029 with a bruised and battered Logan trying to make a living while helping out an aging and decrepit Xavier. The story then turns towards Logan being tasked to help X-23. I will stop there as to not spoil anything in the least. I will continue onto the acting with both Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as Xavier giving the most awe-inspiring performances of their careers as these characters which have been 17 years in the making since their on-screen adaptations have emerged. The newest star Dafne Keen as Luara/X-23 did an outstanding job and Boyd Holbrook as Donal Pierce was a BADASS. The acting all around was a Masterpiece. The action is what most people are going to go and watch this movie for in my opinion and it doesn't disappoint. The action is gritty, gore-filled and gratuitous and I may add that it had a sort-of mesmerizing effect throughout the entire movie. The action was enthralling and the fact that most of it was done without the use of CG makes it even more fascinating. The cinematography is uncompromising and very surreal and each shot is done with such integrity for the craft that it can't help but be noticed thanks to James Mangold. I will close by saying this is a Must-Watch film. The film is filled with subtle nuances and nods to the old while bringing what is surely to be the new to the forefront. The film has a good amount of humor and also a heartfelt embrace that is soon never to be forgotten for as long as you live. P.S. IMAX is the Pinnacle POV to enjoy this film to the fullest in my opinion.",

It's bleak, not bright, fun entertainment like the X-men films. Professor X has dementia which combined with his psychic powers makes him a danger to every one around it. Wolverine's healing powers are fading too but he keeps looking after his mentor. A flicker of hope comes in the form of the next generation, the new mutants if you will. Jackman delivers his best acting performance so far, full of raw emotion, pain and sorrow. The action scenes are exciting and harrowing and the direction overall has a relentless gravitas. The crushing inevitability of aging and death couldn't be more clearly illustrated than in Wolverine's bloody battles with a younger, stronger, faster clone of himself.

855,6 March 2017,metalfaiaz,10, Logan is quite frankly brilliant,"Logan is probably the most hyped X-Men film of all time and I promise you this film will not only meet your hype but downright break your expectations.This is a searing epilogue to the character of Wolverine and a swan song for Hugh Jackman after 17 years of playing this legendary role.Logan is not only in my opinion the best marvel superhero film ever,arguably this is the best superhero film ever as well.I know in terms of technical ability Dark Knight might just edge Logan out but in terms of enjoyment this is an experience that is yet to be matched by a superhero film.It's brutal and merciless and when I say say brutal and merciless I MEAN IT.I mean we all knew that it was a R-Rated film but nothing can prepare you for the hell that will unleash upon.I don't care what people will say but Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewert are Oscar worthy in this film.This is most probably the first film where Hugh Jackman was challenged as an actor to play Wolverine and sadly it's his last.After 17 years of playing this role he knew everything about the character like the back of his hand but in this movie he had to portrait a person not a hero.It was gritty,brutal and downright gut wrenching.And can we talk about X-23 now?BEST SIDE KICK EVER!!!!!In fact she is much more bad ass than Wolverine.Wolverine is very worn out in this film.We see that the world has taken it's toll on him so,he doesn't fight too often but when he does you'll feel sorry for the guy who's gonna fight him.But when Wolverine isn't using his claws to slice up wholesale meat it's X-23 who does it and HOLY Crap!It's brutal and Awesome.Dafne Keen plays the role of X-23 and before going into this film I was kind of skeptical cause she's a kid and we all know kids in Hollywood movies are always the weak link.Can someone just slap me now for thinking that?She knocks it out of the park.I don't know if she'll feature in any future X-men films or not but I'd give anything to see her in this role.Let's talk about the action,Probably the one of the best action film of the decade and not just because it utilizes it's R-Rating brilliantly,The fight sequences are genuinely well choreographed.It's absolutely insane. Is it a perfect film?No,it's not.Do I give one ounce of crap?No,I don't.It's the most fun I've had watching a superhero film and that's the only thing that matters.",

Professor X is just as pathetic, and the new kid is cool albeit ridiculously tiny and brutal. Turns out to be a messy mesh of Mad Max and the Expendables, without the fun & humor. Not much entertainment to be had from the forced realism in this limpy epilog of a fantasy superhero saga.",

I almost think without Logan there was almost an all time film beneath as if that story of getting older and become mentally unwell there was a golden film like a great like Schindler's list. Im a big xman fan but the rest was uneasy violence almost a ""snuff"" film a child stabbing men men stabbing men which a knife is always way more gory i just felt it was just too violent. Xmen films are more kids adventure but the mix of a golden film (with just a bit of early life happiness story before the decline is all it needed just a light splatter of young love and happiness) against the violence just didn't mix for me but i had to give it 5 stars just for Patrick steward even though in my silly little worthless opinion it needed less xmen more early life.

How can Jean Grey die? The writer obviously has no understanding of the material. Not only that, has no continuity. How did Wolverine get his adamantium claw back from the previous Wolverine in Japan? What's worse is that the director of that Wolverine and Logan is same guy.",
862,12 January 2022,Kenisto,8, A good movie,The movie gives you almost everything. Plenty of action scenes but not too many. And the movie did not disappoint when it got to strong scenes. Powerful scenes mixed with the action made a good movie. I thought the movie went pretty fast. I personally feel that the first half was a bit boring. The second part was better. The scenes and the story were better in my opinion.,

Secondly, ... 11 year old girl who got superpowers via experiments on a lab, trying to turn her into a weapon, barely talks, loves to eat...where have we seen this? Oh right. Stranger things. This girl even looks like eleven. Its a downright knockoff version of her. And don't come saying 'but she existed before Eleven, in the comics.' No. In the comics shes a much older girl nothing like this character. Depressing movie all in all.",

865,30 March 2022,szlachcic-49538,9, Perfect ending of long... Long story,"Hugh Jackman was playing wolverine for... 17 years so his story needed that kind of ending. Making it PG16 was one of the best decisions that fox made about xmen series. It's not an ending for wolverine only, but few more characters (i won't tell which because of spoilers) and was supposed to be beginning of new mutans (that didn't worked ofc). When i was watching it i had no idea, that Hugh face was deep faked the whole movie so he could look older and more... Tired of life, just willing to die. The villain... I don't really know what to say aboit him, he just was, but the real villain in my opinion was Logan itself. The whole familly part between Logan, Laura and Charles worked really well, showing that Logan never experienced that kind of life before - chill, easy, normal for first time. ""Thats how life can looks like Logan"" ~ Profesor X. I think that this movie shows how superhero stories should be ended and i wish that for example Tobey Maguire spiderman will get that kind of ending one day. This is solid kind of movie.",
866,7 March 2017,Return_of_the_Porg,9," Emotional, transcendent and a powerful farewell","Emotionally charged, violent and emotional are just some of the words that can be used to accurately describe this spectacular sendoff to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. Logan transcends the comic-book genre to tell an emotional and rather beautiful story of family. Behind all the metal claws explosions and action set-pieces Logan's true strengths are the characters we've come to love for more than 17 years. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart give some incredible performances. But Jackman's work is nothing short of spectacular, he is at his absolute best portraying this beat down and old version of Logan. The movie does an excellent job of showing how Logan is tired of being Wolverine and alive in general. We get to see why his character is so destroyed internally and this helps us sympathize with this version of Wolverine more than any previous incarnation. The writing in this movie is also excellent, the interactions between Professor X and Logan are handled with so much care and attention to detail that the numerous references that are mentioned seem natural and unforced. The film also presents a great dynamic between Logan and Laura (the little girl). One of my initial fears is that she would be a sort of drag or an plot device kind of character. But not only does she have a purpose, every interaction whether dialogue or action that involves her is great and brutal. Speaking of which the R rating is more than deserved, this film is brutal. It does not hold back any punches and truly fits the narrative and the story that is being presented. My only complaint with this movie is a part where a lot of exposition happens, this isn't what bothers me, what bothers me is how the information is delivered. I don't wanna spoil anything but it is nonsensical and it took me out of the movie for a while. Overall I consider Logan as my favorite comic-book film ever made. It was a fitting,beautiful and emotional send off to one of the most beloved actor/character combination in cinematic history. I'm curious to see where the character will go from here. 9/10",
867,18 March 2017,cmerrittphantom,9, X-emplary!,"I was inspired by this film. I don't say that lightly. Most films I like are merely entertaining, but this one was something special.

873,10 March 2017,superbrendan715,10, A superhero movie for everyone!,"""Logan"" is the newest addition to the ""X-Men"" franchise, and is directed by James Mangold and stars Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Dafne Keen. From the beginning of this film you can tell how gritty and dark this movie will be as all of the mutants from the previous ""X- Men"" films have died tragically except for a few. The main character Logan takes care of a very old Charles Xavier as he is diagnosed with Dementia. However, their lives change after a young girl named Laura comes into their lives. This movie truly is special in every way, and may be the best superhero film of all time. This film deal heavily with a emotional theme as these characters that we have learned to love have become severely depressed and are in great pain due to previous incidents that have happened to them and others. This film was made to explore the human condition, as this movie lets the audience feel like superheroes do not always have the best life or the best conditions. In fact, this movie lets the audience know that the world is not always fair even to superheroes, and sometimes bad things can happen to good people.",

It's not like they're going to cast a new actor to play Wolverine any time soon, eh? He's been in every single one of the X- men movies for 17 years. Hugh Jackman is iconic in this role, so why would they be in a hurry to replace him? Especially when now's the chance to make movies without him and maybe focus on some of the other characters.",

876,3 February 2019,blazesuncaster,10, Logan movie review,"I CAN NOT EXPLAIN ENOUGH ON HOW GOOD THIS MOVIE IS!!!!!!! oh my gosh where do I even begin. I guess I'll start with the story. Logan is a broken down man just trying to reach the service of staying alive and taking care of an aging Charles Xavier. Logan then fines himself in a predicament when he comes along this other mutant with the same powers as him. Her name is Laura. And his job is to get her to her destination while also protecting here from the Revers. OH MY GOD, this is a good freaking movie. Now back to the review. This story was so well planned out and so well executed that it is hard for me to find the words on how good this film was. The lighting, the cinematography, the score, and of course the directing, holy crap was the directing good. James Mangold (the director) has come back from making his previous Wolverine film ""The Wolverine."" And I don't care what people say about the Wolverine, it was fantastic in my opinion. Not as good as this masterpiece of course, but still flipping amazing. But back to what I was saying, James Mangold is a master at its least when it comes to directing this film. The passing of this film is so good it flows like a stream of water. Now let's get to the acting. Hugh Jackman gives without a doubt his best performance in his film career. And I'm talking ""The Prestige"" level of performance. I love Hugh jackman and think he was freaking amazing in this movie. And Dafnee Keen also gives her best performance even though she has only been in a show and an upcoming movie ""untitled."" But still gives a mind blowing performance. Patrick Stewart holy s@@@ man. He knocked it out of the park with this performance. By far his best performance as well. As this being Hugh's and Patrick's swan song. I think that they went out with a bang and gave us. Especially me a time to remember. This is by far my favorite marvel, and probably my favorite movie of all time. I'm serious!!!!. This movie gets a 100%",

879,4 March 2017,PetarNeo,10, It's bloody great,"After they announced this is going to be last Wolverine instalment there was a lot of mixed emotions but after seeing this magnificently beautiful picture there is no doubt that it will be remembered as one of the best series sequels if not the best. Logan takes us to totally different and unexpected journey of survival and pain. Presenting Logan as old, disturbed and without any positive though whatsoever was really brilliantly melted into this incredibly written plot and story. This relentless and heart breaking drama that is mixed with maybe some of the most brutal and terrifying violence that is show throughout whole movie and never stops to surprise gave movie so much power. Seeing Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) so old and weak but in the same time so powerful and without control over his mind was quite disturbing and frightening but in the same time love for Logan and Laura was greater than anything. Laura Kinney (Dafne Keen) is the girl that is created so she could serve a weapon for fighting. She was so terrifying and violent that it was in some point weird to look at that but also her charisma and emotions and how she starts to understand more was interesting to watch. Logan (Hugh Jackman) gave us a surprise that maybe no one expected because his performance is probably the best superhero/drama performance ever seen. His disturbing character in year 2029 has seen too much and in every scene he proves that point and gives one of the best performances of his. Also a great and funny character was Caliban (Stephen Merchant) and he added something original to movie and gave a good performance in couple scenes that he featured. James Mangold is the man responsible for the Logan as he put a great effort in creating an amazing script and directing movie in incredible way. If time has come for superhero movie to push his way in some of major award this movie could do it because of its never stopping drama and some of the great efforts by cast. 4/4",

Another asks why the children did what they did during numerous events? They are kids moron. Why didn't Xavier sense X-24 was there (the reviewer said he was a robot which automatically make him stupid). Xavier is drugged up most of the movie that is why.
