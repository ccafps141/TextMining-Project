The workers are controlled by their leader Maria (Brigitte Helm), who wants to find a mediator between the upper class lords and the workers, since she believes that a heart would be necessary between brains and muscles. Maria meets Freder Fredersen (Gustav Fröhlich), the son of the Lord of Metropolis Johhan Fredersen (Alfred Abel), in a meeting of the workers, and they fall in love for each other. Meanwhile, Johhan decides that the workers are no longer necessary for Metropolis, and uses a robot pretending to be Maria to promote a revolution of the working class and eliminate them.",/
1,16 February 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,10, Early science fiction story that presents a pessimistic prediction of a future society.,"Who ever heard of an epic science fiction film? Especially in the 1920s? Sure, some science fiction movies are huge today, such as George Lucas' latest goofy Star Wars movie, but in 1926, Fritz Lang came out with a brilliant film about what the future would be like if people went on living the way they were living back then. And sure enough, we went right ahead living the way we were living, the population got bigger and more crowded, and now modern society is not a whole lot different from what was presented in Metropolis.

2,25 August 2005,Coventry,8, So oldand yet so futuristic!,"Fritz Lang's groundbreaking landmark remains one of the biggest mysteries in the world of cinema. How can a movie that'll soon turn 80 years old still look so disturbingly futuristic?? The screenplay by Thea Von Harbou is still very haunting and courageously assails social issues that are of all ages. The world has been divided into two main categories: thinkers & workers! If you belong to the first category, you can lead a life of luxury above ground but if you're a worker, your life isn't worth a penny, and you're doomed to perilous labor underground. The further expansions and intrigues in the screenplay are too astonishing to spoil, so I strongly advise that you check out the film yourself. It's essential viewing, anyway! ""Metropolis"" is a very demanding film-experience and definitely not always entertaining. But, as it is often the case with silent-cinema classics, the respect and admiration you'll develop during watching it will widely excel the enjoyment-aspect. Fritz' brutal visual style still looks innovative and few directors since were able to re-create a similarly nightmarish composition of horizontal and vertical lines. Many supposedly 'restored' versions have been released over the years (in 1984 and 2002, for example) but the 1926-version is still the finest in my opinion, even though that one already isn't as detailed and punctual as Lang intended it. ""Metropolis"" perhaps is THE most important and influential movie ever made. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Star Wars"" and ""Blade Runner"" owe their existence (or at least their power) to it.",e
3,24 April 1999,PIST-OFF,9, The father of sci-fi cinema.,"Silent movies are not for everyone. Neither are subtitles. Those brave enough to view a movie with no sound and words that are far and few between should definitely enjoy this silent masterpiece. One of the biggest productions of its time, Metropolis still holds its own when set design and special effects are compared. But what Metropolis really has is orginality. This German-Expressionist film had such originality in everything from its costumes to its views of a future (modern) city that its ideas can still be seen everywhere in modern sci-fi. Star Wars's C-3PO was based on Bridgette Helm's robot. Dark City and Brazil both have Metropolis look-a-like cities. This is a very good movie. It's too bad most movies don't have its originality.",v

6,5 July 2019,AlsExGal,10," Even if you ignore the story, I could spend 150 minutes staring at the art design...","... and the story is worth paying attention! It is just about a perfect silent film experience. It is the story of a two-tiered society. Above ground, a modern city, with most of the young people immersed in decadent behavior and leisure, because all of the machines, below ground, do the work. Joh Fredersen is the architect of the city, and must be some kind of strongman, because if he fires you the result is you are sent to live ""in the depths"", below the city, with the workers. The workers have an existence so bleak that they trudge together in some kind of synchronized slouched shuffle as the shift changes among those tied to the giant machines. Even those getting off for the shift show no joy. It is almost prescient of concentration camp occupants a decade or so later .",w
7,25 April 2005,ignatz928,9, Watch the Kino DVD!,"Technically speaking, I have seen this Fritz Lang silent sci-fi before, but this was the first time I saw it in any shape by which I could fairly evaluate it. I had previously watched Metropolis on a public domain VHS from the 80s. The print was terribly scratched and while there were a few memorable images, the story was so incoherent that their context was usually unclear. Though this was clearly not the best way to see Metropolis, I was still left with an impression of this supposed classic as a dusty museum piece that was praised by critics because they were expected to like it. So finally seeing a restored and expanded copy was as much as a revelation as seeing Once Upon a Time in the West letter boxed in how it led me to reevaluate my opinion of the movie. The movie is a strange mixture of political speculation political parable, apocalyptic fantasy, and religious allegory. It depicts a futuristic city that is divided between the wretched workers, who toil in the depths tending the machines, and the upper classes, who dwell in luxury up in the skyscrapers. The hero, the idle, pampered son of the city's supervisor Joh Fredersen, changes his ways and becomes concerned with the plight of the lower classes after catching a glimpse of Maria, the Madonna of the workers. His father, meanwhile, is plotting to thwart Maria with the help of the mad scientist Rotwang, who has discovered how to create robot replicas of human beings. One of the most surprising things about watching this version is just how much I didn't see. In addition to restoring scenes to the film, the DVD also includes inter titles to explain pieces of the plot that cannot be found in any version. With these changes, the story becomes much clearer, particularly the machinations of Rotwang and the master of Metropolis. Perhaps most importantly, a whole new subplot is added involving the hero's dead mother Hel, who was loved by both his father and Rotwang. With this clarification of the back-story, the close but adversarial relationship between Rotwang and Fredersen becomes much clearer. In some ways it recalls the family back-story of the Star Wars movies. Of course, the real strength of Metropolis isn't the story, which is pretty silly and probably wouldn't have worked in anything but a silent film, but its amazing visuals, which in their scale and ambitiousness look forward to 2001 and Blade Runner. Actually, though in most respects silent films now look primitive, one area in which they have the edge over modern film-making is in their frequently grandiose production design. Metropolis employs huge sets to show the hellish factories of the subterranean world. The models of the city's towering skyscrapers are also surprisingly convincing for a 1920s film. Even beyond the expansive production design and (for the time) special effects, Lang's visuals are all consistently inventive. The robot Maria provides some of the movie's most iconic images, including her transformation into a human being. In a later scene, she performs for upper-class men in a nightclub, and as she performs a striptease that in 1920s Germany was apparently seen as very decadent, the screen is filled with wet staring eyeballs. A sign of Lang's visual lavishness, and the studio's, that he doesn't hesitate to throw in lavish dream and hallucination sequences to drive home a point or illustrate a character's state of mind. For instance, when the hero first enters the subterranean city and sees rows upon rows of workers toiling on huge machines, he imagines the furnace transforming into a monstrous idol's head into which the workers are being sacrificed. At another point, while he's sick in bed he imagines statues of the Seven Deadly Sins coming to life and advancing out from a wall in a cathedral. When Maria preaches her message of peace and understanding to the workers, she tells them the story of the Tower of Babel of a management vs. labor parable, and Lang gives us spectacular images of the tower's construction and fall. In a sound film many of these scenes would have seemed redundant and over-literal, but they're what silent cinema does best -tell a story without the advantage- or obstacle- of dialogue. The story is a little slow to start, but once it picks up Metropolis becomes one of the most directly involving silent films that I've seen. In addition to being a pioneering example of the cinematic possibilities of science fiction, Metropolis also has to be one of the earliest disaster films, as the workers riot and sabotage the machines, endangering the entire city. Lang creates a sense of rising fury and nihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what was going to happen to Germany in less than 20 years.",/
8,3 December 2004,ACitizenCalledKane,8," Highly influential and, dare I say, prophetic?","Fritz Lang's Metropolis is the first true masterpiece of science fiction in film. You can see it's influence in films such as Star Wars, The Matrix, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, Blade Runner, and countless others. Despite the fact that parts of the film are no longer available, the efforts to reconstruct the original film from its remains are valiant enough to provide enough to make the story clear. The special effects were far ahead of their time and the set designs were, in some cases, phenomenal. I can see where some people may not enjoy this movie. It is hard for some to really appreciate a movie that is 77 years old, because a lot has happened in film since then. Yet, if you look at the basic elements of this movie - its story, characters, artwork, cinematography, etc., I believe this movie has just as much to offer now as it must have in the late 1920's. Also, take into consideration the asthetics of German expressionist film when viewing this. The performances and set designs are going to be over the top. That was part of the style. Metropolis may not be for everyone, but, for those willing to read between the lines, this film still has a lot to offer!",r
9,30 January 2019,elicopperman,8, The Future Displayed through Social Allegory,"Whenever people are asked what they consider to be revolutionary and historically significant in terms of classic cinema, one answer that frequently comes up is Metropolis, and it's not hard to see why. In addition to being a very impressive technical achievement for its time, the film is well known as the very first feature-length sci fi film. While it wasn't met with a very warm reception upon its release (not to mention having been cut since then), it has made a massive impact over the decades for its biting allegory and themes of purity mixed in with knowledge and strength.",w

11,13 March 2004,Bockharn,10, Restored Kino DVD changed my view of this film.,"I doubt that I'd ever seen anything resembling a ""complete"" version of METROPOLIS before, though certain of its scenes were familiar to me, if only as used and abused in such films as Diane Keaton's HEAVEN (1987).  In any case, whatever I had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty of the Kino restoration.  I expected to be distracted by the restoration's technique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences, but the narrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it.  As ""exaggerated"" as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards, some performances, such as the Master of the city, are amazingly nuanced and layered, and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone. The meticulous design of the film, the unerring camera placement and Lang's muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking. I'd thought of METROPOLIS as a curiosity (""important"" = ""dull"") but now I've come to appreciate it as the seminal work it has always been.",0
12,31 July 2005,classicsoncall,8," ""Who are the slaves of the machines?""","""There can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator."" This is the predominant theme of ""Metropolis"", and director Fritz Lang finds numerous ways to say and visualize his message during the course of the film. The movie relies on repeated visual imagery to make it's point, and does so effectively even if tedious at times. Particularly effective is the representation of the worker society as an almost single living unit, moving trance like to their appointed time and task. The use of a ""ten hour"" clock in the workers' chamber constantly draws our attention, as does the hangdog posture of the individual slaves who grind out their workday as if in a daze.",6

15,17 April 2006,Igenlode Wordsmith,6," Stunning imagery, pity about the plot","One definitely can't fault the breadth and ambition of Fritz Lang's vision, even if, as always with depictions of the future, there are a few forgivable blind spots. (The cars that swarm up and down the multiple levels of Metropolis are unmistakably the standard models of the 1920s, as are the flying-machines that buzz about them; while the business dress of tomorrow's rulers, unlike their exotic leisure wear, doesn't appear to have advanced one iota!)",7
16,18 December 1998,Birwin,10," A fantastic movie, a must see","I was shocked to find myself riveted to this movie. This is without a doubt the best sci-fi movie I've ever seen! Let me explain my position. We have all seen modern sci-fi movies, and argued over which is the best ever made, but those film makers have high speed film and computers. Imagine trying to make a movie today with only the tools available to Fritz Lang in 1925, and even if you used a modern camcorder it would be nigh impossible! This is a must see for all persons interested in the history of film, as well as just good fun for everyone.

18,19 September 2014,utgard14,10," ""Do you think that losing a hand is too high a price to pay for re-creating Hel?!""","Peerless silent sci-fi masterpiece from Fritz Lang. My favorite film of his and probably my favorite silent film overall. A masterfully crafted epic with striking visuals that will blow your mind, especially given that this was released in 1927. The special effects and sets are remarkable and unlike anything else seen at the time. The style has been copied many times down through the decades. It's still being copied today. There are maybe a handful of films that have been as stylistically influential as Metropolis. The story is intriguing and thought-provoking, although it may not be the cup of tea for sensitive political types. Hopefully even those people will be able to appreciate the remarkable technical and artistic achievements of this film. A lot of people will balk at watching this because it's a silent movie. Well they are missing out on something truly special. Epic, classic, and groundbreaking are words that are often overused with many movies but not this one. This is a true work of art that deserves all the praise it gets.",?

20,9 August 2011,morrison-dylan-fan,10, Metropolis:The Reconstructed and Restored Cut.,"Ever since I've decided to become introduced to silent cinema,with Alfred Hitchcock's outline- setting film The Manxman and John Ford's industrial revaluation western The Iron Horse,the name Fritz Lang has had an almost magnetic grip of being at the very top of my list,of directors whose work I have been eagerly wanting to view.When I heard a few years ago,about a ""holy grail"" being struck for film history,with a worn out copy of Langs silent epic Metropolis being pulled out of oblivion,and leading to the huge discovery of twenty five minutes of missing scenes/moments being found in the print.After reading that the film was going to be kept safely in a preservation society,due to the understandably fragile nature of the film,my expectations of this cut of the film coming out on home video gradually disappeared.Years later,I decided to search on Amazon UK to see what titles had been realised from The Masters Of Cinema DVD company. (the UK's version of Criterion) To my amazement,right at the very top of the page,was a very sophisticated looking DVD of the reconstructed/restored edition of Metropolis!.With having just started to discover the world of silent cinema,and looking at one of the most tempting DVDs which I have seen in years,I felt that it was the perfect time for me to see the full creation of Fritz Lang's futuristic city.",e
21,24 April 2015,anaconda-40658,10, The Future of Sci-Fi!,"Metropolis (1927): Dir: Fritz Lang / Cast: Gustay Frohlich, Brigitte Helm, Alfred Abel, Rudolf Klein-Rogge, Heinrich George: Absolute masterpiece by director Fritz Lang about man's slavery to machines. Workers file onto an elevator in a haunting manner overseen by their boss who is angered when his son Fleder passes through the gate to observe the operation. Fleder is transfixed on Maria who is a Christ-like figure instructing peace. The boss turns to a mad scientist who constructs a robot in Maria's image. She will lead the people to destruction by destroying the machines. By doing this the operation floods putting workers out of homes. Meanwhile the mad scientist kidnaps Maria thus placing Fleder in a position of heroism. Extraordinary vision of mechanics and magnificent production that put Lang ahead of his time. The machinery is detailed and visualized paving the road to an onslaught of clones that mostly never measure up. Alfred Abel plays the boss who symbolizes man's lack of understanding as well as the portal to improvement. Rudolf Klein-Rogge plays the scientist who symbolizes corruption and defeat. Brigitte Helm as Maria symbolizes peace and the hope for a brighter future. Heinrich George as the foreman represents the common citizen or worker who is deemed an explanation when catastrophe hits. Gustay Frohlich as Fleder represents the willingness to improve. Score: 10 / 10",f

23,23 July 2006,planktonrules,10," Possibly the greatest silent film--if not, at least one of the very best","I am so happy that I saw this film again recently on Turner Classic Movies. I first saw it many years ago on a cheap public domain videotape and I was not that impressed by the film. The print was of dubious quality and the story itself not overly impressive. BUT, when TCM released a newly restored version, the print was nearly pristine, the new orchestra music was fantastic and actually fit the film and, more importantly, the film was significantly longer--by about 20 minutes! It seems that over the years, so much of this film was cut here and there and the film degraded so much, that anyone watching these inferior versions is strongly recommended to see it again in its better form. Now this better form isn't 100% perfect, as there were a few tiny places where they had to insert stills to complete the scenes (a practice becoming more and more common with restored silent films and even some sound ones like LOST HORIZON).",=

I'm glad I finally saw it, but agree with all the recent critical reviews. The film is overlong, by at least an hour. Certain scenes stretch interminably. Yes, it's impressive for its time in terms of special effects, but the story is mundane, the characters uninteresting (and unrealistic), and the film's message largely muddled (and pretty mundane). Even in the basic terms of sheer entertainment value it falls short, unlike other silent classics of this time (e.g., Keaton's The General). Fritz Lang made great films (""M"" for example), but this just no longer holds up, except in the context of film history. It's interesting as a key moment in that evolving process, but as a movie it's bloated and unengaging.",t

The film that single-handedly pioneered a genre. Just, impressive. I've been waiting a good few years to watch this German expressionistic silent film, and the time has finally come. With 150 minutes being recovered and mostly restored from the 153 minute original runtime, this was the closest to the full cut I was ever going to get. Fritz Lang not only implanted his views on authoritarianism and capitalism, but he crafted and adapted a film revolving around the idea of social justice.

28,4 May 2006,Hitchcoc,10, It set the bar very high.,"I first saw this in a science fiction class in college. It was an actual movie in class. Wow! I had read about Fritz Lange and his contributions to the cinema and I had seen still pictures from this film. I was astonished that it had been made in 1927. The special effects, particularly those within the city, are amazing. The basic premise, the haves and the have nots works very well. Lange turned his people into machines and had them toil darkly for little, reducing them to automatons. This is remindful of ""The City in the Clouds,"" a Star Trek episode where those in power can't fathom what the enslaved miners must do every day. Of course it's about collectivism and socialism and all those other -isms. It's also about people and how they come to see themselves as oppressors. The fun-loving lifestyle is set in the middle of the poverty and pain of those who have nothing. There are wonderful expressions in close ups of faces, both expressing their misery and being empathetic toward it. The film gathers momentum toward revolution. It's the age old story. It's presented in a masterful way. Perhaps this is the best of all the silent films because of its content and its political implications. I wonder what the capitalists of the early 20th century thought of the movie.",r

Perhaps it was seeing the film in the greatest possible format (a fully restored print on the KINO DVD, filled with inter-titles to keep the story complete) that had me appreciate it more, but even if I had seen the film on a scratchy print or with not very appropriate music (i.e. Giorgio Moroder's experimental cut), it would still be affecting.

It was the first ever science-fiction feature film when it was made in 1927, and what's also notable is that the film remained partially lost for many years.

Finally in an effort to prevent his son from going back, Joh orders reclusive scientist CA Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) to build a robot model of Maria, who in the form of Maria inspires to workers to rebel and riot around Metropolis.

The techniques and styles that I thought were more modern, results of decades of filmmaking, are actually born from this time. The models of the city, the machines, everything, was spectacular. The sets were so grand and stylized, absolutely stunning. The style of this film is breathtaking. This is my favorite film of the Expressionist era. Characteristics of other Expressionist films that I felt were too dramatic were just right in Metropolis. The acting was just right, not too over-dramatic. There were still moments of arms flailing, eyes bulging, and random, intimate, somewhat forceful embraces, but generally the performances were perfect. I love the way the underground workers performed so uniformly in their exhaustion, despair, and hope, waning hope. Maria's performance was particularly stellar to me. The make-up, the hair, use of lights and shadows, and the set design indicative of Expressionism were all excellent.",

However it opened in 1927 to mixed reactions and barely made 75000 Reichsmarks. Because of its long running-time of over 150 minutes and the inclusion of footage which censors found questionable, Metropolis was butchered substantially after its German premiere, and large portions of the film went missing over the subsequent decades.

Both French and American film-makers were putting in the hard yards in this respect, but this silent effort from 1927 distinguished itself even further. Descending from Germany, and made by a director who was already turning heads in his ability to combine adventure with spectacle, here was somebody building on what had preceded the project only to end up combining character and story with genre on top of visual appeal and a socio-political undertone.

The plot involves a futuristic society of haves, who live above ground (""The Head""), and the have-nots (""The Hands""), who populate the world below. The haves, of course, are the plutocrats and city planners who call all of the shots. In their Utopia, they enjoy the sunshine and modern means of transportation to their stadiums and gardens and skyscrapers. The haves are generally oblivious to the have-nots, who inhabit the never-world. The have-nots, locked in their Dystopia, are equally unaware of the world above. Like drones, they have numbers for names, work hard and run the many machines that keep the society functioning. Or do the machines run the workers? Early in the film, our hero has a vision; a burned-out machine turns into a fearsome devourer monster Moloch. (Note that Moloch was the ancient Phoenician pagan god to whom the Canaanites and Carthaginians sacrificed their children.) What really had happened was that there was injury and death from an industrial accident (A machine had overpowered a worker.)

Some moments and performances are melodramatic to the point of heavy laughter, it's way overlong, and the story is no where near as compelling as its visuals. That being said, this is still the ultimate German Expressionist classic. Crooked windows, creepy shadows, unforgettable imagery in nearly every frame. This mixture of futurism and Expressionism is what keeps ""Metropolis"" moving along at a perfect pace. There is tons of thrilling action, mind boggling surrealism, and wild editing; enough to keep even the average moviegoer at least mildly entertained. It is likely to inspire headaches or confusion, laughter and tears and shouts and so on. ",

The sad thing is that we are seeing Metropolis in a butchered form. Seven reels were taken out when it premiered in The United States. Many saw the film as confusing, but that was because it was shown in such a chopped up way. In fact, Giogio Morodor tried to restore the film to it's original even using stills to flesh it out. But despite this, the movie still has a power today that it did when it first aired. Fritz Lang was a director par excellence and it shows in this. Rotwang played by Rudolf Klein Rogge set the standard for every mad scientist ever played. The wild hair, mad eyes and intense expression has been copied, but never matched.

No matter how revolutionary the avant-garde movement was for art as a whole, the modernists' true medium, was definitely, the last, seventh art. Metropolis captures perfectly the zeitgeist of its moment: the Weimar's republic contradictions and overlapping between Marxist ideas, Christian references and a futuristic faith in the machines. The way these interplay is astonishing, because the final result is as relevant to today's reality as it was to that of the inter-war period. We still have segregated cities; we still have enslaved proletarians in East Asia building iPhones for a few; violent revolution is still not the answer. And I find very curious how the movie, despite its socialist claims, depicts the workers as an irrational crowd, easily manipulated by pretty much anyone with a tiny bit of agency. And the relation Man-Machine is never completely resolved: are they evil? are they a tool for exploitation? are they the basis of our survival?",

71,13 September 2010,robert-temple-1,10," 2010 final restoration version, a miracle of rediscovery of a lost masterpiece","The occasion of my 500th review for IMDb seems a good time to review one of the greatest masterpieces of the history of the cinema. At last! The DVD is out with the restoration which took 12 years and the combined efforts of many people and organisations, putting Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS back together again for the first time since 1927, adding half an hour of recovered footage to the length, digitally enhancing every frame, improving the titles, and with the wonderful bonus of the restoration of the original 1927 orchestral score. This may be the greatest cinematic restoration and recovery effort in history, and it gives back to us a version of one of the world's major films as last seen in Berlin in 1927, and never seen anywhere outside Berlin even then. The monstrous mutilation of this masterpiece commenced almost as soon as the premiere was over. The recovered footage was found a few years ago in Argentina, no copy having survived in Europe. Now that we can see Lang's true conception of the film, which is wholly different from the mutilated versions which have been shown for the past 83 years, the story at last makes sense. Every time we saw METROPOLIS before, it was not really METROPOLIS at all, and was not even remotely authentic. The footage had been re-edited in such a horribly distorted way that sometimes scenes were used to mean precisely the opposite of what they were originally intended to signify. The DVD contains important interviews, demonstrations, and information about all of this. What happened to this film was as if someone had taken a Rembrandt self-portrait and over-painted it as the portrait of a young girl; the over-painting has now been stripped off entirely, and we see revealed the film which Lang and his wife Thea von Harbou, the joint script writers, originally envisioned. This film was enthusiastically adopted by Goebbels and other Nazis, and von Harbou herself became a fanatical Nazi, so Lang divorced her and famously fled to America after Hitler showed too much interest in him. But that is a long story and one which is well known. One of the most unforgettable aspects of this film are the scenes where the workers march in gangs with their heads lowered in submission, and their simultaneous tread is a monotonous machine-like dragging of their exhausted bodies towards their labour. Doubtless these scenes of the masses dominated by an elite excited the Nazis, as did the visions of a future technological wonderland where speed, power, and efficiency are portrayed with rapturous awe. Of course, there are the dark forces, and there is the unspeakably evil 'Mechanical Man', who is actually female in form, having been given the likeness of the saintly Maria (who had been trying to give hope to the downtrodden workers by addressing secret mass meetings in the catacombs far below Metropolis). Both roles are played by the amazing Brigitte Helm, one of the most brilliant German film actresses ever. Helm quit the film business and moved to Switzerland in 1935 in disgust at Hitler. She must have been as scared as Lang at the combined menace of Hitler, Goebbels, and Thea von Harbou, all of whom must have had their eye on her just as they did Lang. Helm's real surname, by the way, was Schittenhelm, and it is just as well she shortened it! She lived to be 90. Alas, I was in Ascona while she was still alive, and did visit one grand dame who lived there in retirement, but had no idea Helm was there, or I would have tried to meet her as well. Anyone who has seen Helm in one of her films can never forget her. In METROPOLIS she is scintillatingly brilliant both as Jekyll and as Hyde, and she had eyes like road-drills. Alfred Abel is particularly good in this film as the oligarch Joh Fredersen. He exudes an air of such self-assured calm, the very mannered tranquility of the truly rich which drove F. Scott Fitzgerald so wild with excitement and made him think of the rich as a different species, so that he could never stop writing about them with the enthusiasm of a groupie. Rudolf Klein-Rogge is the mad inventor Rotwang, with wild hair and wilder eyes. He is slightly over-the-top, but then, METROPOLIS is as well. The budget for METROPOLIS was gigantic, and I believe the film was made over a period of 13 months. It was a true epic in both senses, its production and its result. However, it was deemed 'too long' for audiences, so like Erich von Stroheim's GREED (1924), both films being too brilliant and too disturbing, the length was used as a pretext for mediocrities to slash, cut, tear, and rend, like a pack of mad warthogs, as mediocrities above all else enjoy attacking and destroying works of genius. (The reason why mediocrities hate genius is because they are incapable of it themselves, and its very existence rubs their noses in their own inadequacy. Their only defense is to destroy that which brings their own inferiority to notice, so that they can live comfortably in their boring bubble as nonentities, undisturbed by reminders that there is anything higher or better than themselves.) The science fiction effects of this production are so far ahead of their time that their successful achievement was itself a kind of science fiction-made-reality. The 'extras' on the DVD give fascinating insights into how these effects were achieved, and anyone interested in the mechanics of illusion will be spellbound at the revelations which are given as to how Lang achieved his visions on screen. Since METROPOLIS was an attempt to envisage the future, it is highly ironical that it required the future's own arrival 83 years later before we were allowed to see what it was that Lang had actually predicted and envisaged.",

I should mention the film was originally 2 hours and 23 minutes in length when it was released, much of the footage has been lost, but with what has remained, this shortened (1 hour and 59 minutes) version of the sci-fi masterpiece is still an inspiration. Anyway, set in the future (2000, or 2026, both of which far away back then) in the city of Metropolis, and the humans are divided into two groups: thinkers (who enjoy the life in the city, not knowing how anything works), and the workers (who run the city from underground, and achieve all the goals). One thinker, Freder (Gustav Fröhlich), son of the city's running man John Fredersen (Alfred Abel), dares to go below after following his love interest Maria (Brigitte Helm), and after experiencing their world for himself, he joins her cause to try and get both worlds together. Meanwhile, Freder's father discovers scientist C.A. Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) has created a robot, that will take the form of Maria, to get control of the underworld back, and get Freder out the way. The real Maria is imprisoned by Rotwang, while her copy is appearing on stage (in the city) as an exotic dancer. Unfortunately the Maria copy returns to the underworld, and plans for all the workers to rebel, and destroy the ""Heart Machine"" that powers the city. Neither Freder nor Grot (Heinrich George), the machine's foreman, can stop them, and as a result, the machine is destroyed, and the city becomes flooded with both revolting workers and water. In the end, Grot and all the workers finds Maria, who the hold responsible, and they burn her to death, thankfully, it was her copy, and her creator Rotwang also gets what he deserves, and Freder fulfils his role as the ""Mediator"". Also starring Fritz Rasp as Slim, Theodor Loos as Josaphat and Erwin Biswanger as worker 11811. The visuals are magnificent, costing back then an estimated $1,300,000 (imagine how much that would be in today's money), the cityscapes, underground caverns and little special effects are wonderful to look at, the iconic robot (which inspired the look for C-3PO in Star Wars) looks great, and the film features brilliant music by Gottfried Huppertz, one of the best influential silent films ever made. Outstanding!",
76,14 December 2011,EdgarST,10, Metropolis 2010,"I recently saw the 2010 version of ""Metropolis"", with the additional 25 minutes found in a film museum of Buenos Aires. I have a long relationship with this Fritz Lang's film. I think that I have seen it more than 30 times. In the early 1980s, while working for public television in Panamá, I had to adjust its soundtrack (with a non-symphonic version of its original score by Gottfried Huppertz), and later I had to add Spanish subtitles. This edition guided by Enno Patalas, was the official version then, although it was known that there was lost footage. Then I saw the ""Paramount version"" (1928), a mutilation based on Channing Pollock's prosaic and simplistic reinterpretation of its story. After this I saw Giorgio Moroder's ""rock and roll version"" (1984), which I found only interesting for the inclusion of a few lost images. Then I had to study the film for a book published in 1995, for which I read about the lost scenes related to Hel, the mother of Freder, the young protagonist of ""Metropolis"". The reading of this subplot shed light to what I already knew about the story, making it more coherent: loved by the owner of Metropolis, Joh Fredersen, and by the scientist Rotwang, Hel died when she gave birth to Freder. This originated Rotwang's hatred for Fredersen, and his betrayal. When he creates the robot with Maria's face, Rotwang gives her orders contrary to those by Joh Fredersen: instead of encouraging discord among the workers, the robot makes them revolt against Fredersen and destroy the machines. This subplot –as well as the complicity between Freder and Josaphat, the worker his father fires, and the destiny of worker 11811 in the hands of the Thin Man, after being replaced by Freder in the machines room- was incorporated in the 2001 version, by using stills and intertitles, until 2008 when Argentinean archivists found a complete version of the film, containing moving images of those lost elements of the story, all shot by Lang. Although this version also confirmed that there were shots different in scale, angle or acting from one version to another, there was no existing footage to compare these new 25 minutes to. With the surviving intertitle lists that the distributor in Norway had submitted to the censors in late 1920s, the correct translation of the Argentinean titles could be made, and so the 2010 version appeared, which is a must for any film specialist. However the new material was in such a bad condition, that it was not possible to make a satisfactory restoration, from which we could derive complete visual or intellectual pleasure: after watching long sections of material in optimal conditions, when the ""new"", opaque and severely scratched shots are added, the hypnotic effect is lost and we are distracted from the story being told. Instead of being a cinematic trip with ideas, or a science-fiction drama, the experience is turning more and more into a freak show of the film that was, that is no longer there, full of stills and explanatory title cards, and now the dull and scratched Buenos Aires material. It is obvious that this was not the idea of any of the talents involved in this magnum opus, but as Martin Koerber (head specialist of this restoration) declares, it is important to incorporate this material (for now, hoping a better copy appears someday), because it is part of the story of ""Metropolis"", part of the vicissitudes in the history of Art, of the history of the Seventh Art, of the history of cinema in capitalist societies, where a work of art can be destroyed to make a few millions. In the end, it was registered by Unesco in the Memory of the World catalog, and the original message that was scorned and ridiculed by leftists, is still valid: the heart is the mediator between the brain and the hands. In spite of all the efforts, until all the footage of ""Metropolis"" has a minimum of visual quality, these intents to restore it will only have archival and cinéphile value, since they generate only a portion of the fluid and full cinematic pleasure sought by the original version.",

The look and feel of the film is just outstanding, given when it was made it is a tremendous achievement! The film also proves that special effects are nothing new; just look at the robot transformation scene and tell me that would have been easy to do in 1927!

82,27 May 2021,nickenchuggets,10, Legendary,"Metropolis defines the word classic, in every sense. This movie has such a look, feel, and atmosphere to it that hasn't been matched even now that it almost seems mythical. Unlike movies now that seem way too over the top and extreme in terms of exciting things going on all at once, Metropolis moves at a pretty slow pace. This doesn't mean the movie is bad. Far from it. Lang knew that it was a better idea to make the movie move slower rather than faster, since it allows the audience to follow the story easier. Speaking of the story, it's one of the most original of the entire silent era. It is about a man named Freder who is the son of the city's owner, Joh Fredersen. Freder meets a girl named Maria one day, but because the city is sharply divided between the workers and ruling class, he finds it hard to pursue her. Later on, a mad scientist named Rotwang is confronted by Joh over some secret maps, and the scientist tells him his former lover, Hel, left him to be with Joh instead. She then died after having Freder. In order to bring his love back, Rotwang intends to build a ""machine man"" and transfer Maria's life essence into it. He actually succeeds, and later in the film there are now two Maria's: one of which is real and the other is a decoy that wants to destroy the machines in Metropolis and take over the city. Throughout the whole movie, as you might expect, there are large amounts of mechanical objects shown that look futuristic even today. I don't see how anyone can watch this and say it's not a masterpiece. The sheer scale and vastness of the movie can be seen in the first couple of minutes, when you see the enormous new version of the Tower of Babel, as well as the underground where the working class performs their duty. Lang's inspiration for the look of the movie was actually New York City's skyline when he visited in 1924. Tall buildings, flashing lights, and new things called cars taking to the busy streets. There is also a lot of dream-like scenery on display, like when Maria goes into the catacombs and
is attacked by Rotwang in order to bring her to the machine man. Speaking of which, this has to be one of the earliest instances of a robot in a movie. I can't think of anything that comes anywhere close to being this groundbreaking. Many people who know a lot about movies always tell you that Citizen Kane is the best movie ever made. That might be true, because it made really good use of shadows and weird angle shots, but look at Metropolis, over a decade earlier. Classic science fiction setting, towering skyscrapers, strange flying machines in the background, mad scientists, one of the first robots, and a well written story of a man who must act as the mediator between the working class and the wealthy. Why can't Lang get credit for the best film of all time? In any case, Metropolis is without a doubt one of the best science fiction movies ever, and it's almost scary how it predicted a world run by machines.",

Neglected in the wake of sound, surviving prints of the film were left to corrode and decay--and when it began to reach the home market via VHS and DVD the results were very hit or miss; Blackhawk released a fairly credible version of the truncated film to home video, but for the most part the quality of these releases varied from barely mediocre to downright unwatchable.",

The film is far from perfect and has at least three aspects I disliked quite intensely. First, the acting. I am no longer a novice where silent films are concerned and I realise of course that actors on silent film had to make a stronger effort to make emotions visible than when sound became available. But what the ensemble (mainly Brigitte Helm, Alfred Abel, Gustav Fröhlich and Rudolf Klein-Rogge) give us here is too much of a good thing. Every facial expression and every gesture is exaggerated to an extent that is really disturbing. The exception is Helm, whose attempts to look mean and nasty in her role as mechanical Maria (watch her face!) come across as unintentionally funny. You may argue that overacting is part of the much-admired expressionist style of the film. Perhaps. But that does not make it good. Other silent films, earlier and later ones, achieved great effects without such exaggerations. They are far more palatable.",
100,14 February 2007,Dr_Coulardeau,10, The Inventor preaches rebellion,"This film is a myth. 1925-1927 in Germany was a crucial period. The depression was going to arrive soon with its unemployment, financial catastrophe, and nazism. All that is clearly reflected in the film. There are two levels in this city, the underground level for factories and the working class, and the top level for business people, politicians and other privileged people. The latter dance, feast, do nothing but enjoy what other people under them create and produce. This vision of a world cut in two social classes is quite common in those days though today it sounds a little bit schematic. In these days everything was either black or white. The trick in the film is that the son of the ruler of this metropolis falls in love with a certain Maria from underground who preaches the coming of some kind of Messiah to establish peace and freedom for all. She preaches in the catacombs exclusively to working class people. She represents some hope and patience. But it all runs afoul when the ruler decides to get rid of his main counselor and to encourage his inventor to kidnap this Maria to use her face on the inventor's robot. This robot then goes down underground and preaches rebellion and destruction. The real Maria, with the help of the ruler's son and his fired main counselor will save all the children trapped in the underground city and will catch up on the crowd of working class people looking for vengeance in the name of their supposedly lost children. Luckily the good news will change the atmosphere, though not the fate of the false Maria who is already burning at the stake, which reveals she is nothing but a robot. Then the inventor had managed to recapture the real Maria and the ruler's son runs after them. The inventor will be defeated, Maria saved and some kind of peace reestablished between the leader/foreman of the working class and the ruler of the metropolis, thanks to the intermission of the ruler's son who appears to be the Messiah or go-between they were waiting for. The interest of the film here is that it is messianic because it foresees what is going to happen though it tries to avoid it or preach a middle way between the two extremes. We have to think of H.G. Wells and his Time Machine. The two worlds are not incompatible, just not able to communicate any more. The solution, the way out is for Fritz Lang the possibility to communicate again for these two classes, with a strong common ground which is found in some kind of Christian inspiration mainly from the Book of Revelation. But the main interest of the film is technical. It is a film that associates some kind of animation, the filming of pictures, images and objects, and the filming of real characters in the setting that these images represent. For the period it was very advanced and some of the special effects necessary for the depicting of the machines, the factories and the collapse of the underground city are extremely fascinating in spite of their rudimentary nature. It is also a mute film and the acting is extremely expressive, even if the quantity of text is rather important. The point is that the acting is probably just as expressive as Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton, but not in a comic direction, rather in a very tragic and dramatic way. These actors and actresses are able to really express feelings only with their body language. The best case is the main actress who plays both the real Maria and the false Maria. She manages to contrast the two parts perfectly and only with her body language. Some of the visions contained in this film have since been used by many other filmmakers and imitated or even copied by many fiction writers. We should also note the music which accompanies this film. It is slightly repetitive but keeps some liveliness and originality.",

Oh, for future viewers, please avoid at all costs the 80's version with a score by Giorgio Moroder, since it destroys all the suspense and atmosphere of the movie. I don't know who approved that work, and what took Moroder to do it, but the result is like playing a record of him for 2 hours, disconnecting all the climax from the movie which is to it attributed: for example, a horror scene has the same music as the scene where we see images of the city...horrible to say the least. Whatever problems I find in this picture, I have to take my hat to the way it influenced many pictures till this time, like ""The Fifth Element"", ""Blade Runner"" and even ""Batman"" (the final scene of the cathedral is a perfect pastiche of the one in here).

106,22 October 2015,tjgoalie13,9, One of the Most Important Films Ever Made,"In 1927, during one of the harshest times in recent history, German Expressionist director Fritz Lang made Metropolis. Metropolis is one of the most historically important films ever made, because it was an artistic German Expressionist masterpiece, that boldly challenged the Nazi Party, and still has a massive impact on cinema today. It was an angry film pointed at its geographical time and place, but it also offered some major positives for the industry. Lang used several techniques that have become recognized as key elements of German Expressionism, most noticeably lighting. A good example of this was the scene that introduces Maria for the first time, multiple times contrasting lighting techniques were used to highlight particular characters. This technique gave Maria an angelic look, when she spoke, as well as highlighting the reactions of particular characters. Another element of German expressionism was. These lighting techniques were also used often with the presence of the character Rotwang, with this character various lighting techniques were used to make his rooms darker, and give Rotwang large shadows. Just by lighting techniques Lang told the audience how to feel about certain characters, something many filmmakers have since copied. These lighting techniques are great examples of German Expressionism, but they also help shape the narrative, and tone of the film. The narrative of Metropolis leans in the direction of formalist, because it very heavily promotes a thematic point, has a scrambled sense of time, and is occasionally intruded with the director's style. The film's narrative has very clear religious parallels and a clear message, against the Nazi Party, and their regime. At a time when the amount of propaganda films were rising, Metropolis was able to send a message with clever subtlety. The evidence that Lang was angry with the, at the time, new Nazi Party is evident through the religious parallels, especially with Israel. It's no secret how the Nazi's felt about members of the Hebrew religion, and the parallels often connected to the Hebrew religion. The catacomb scene in the film contains the best examples of this as the candles behind Maria resemble a menorah, the iconic candle that the Hebrew religion celebrates Hanukkah with. Maria has a very close association with the woman in Revelation 12, it seems relevant to point out that in the catacomb scene the candles behind Maria, may represent the crown of twelve stars. The religious parallels combined with the well known fact that Fritz Lang didn't like the Nazi Party, most likely because of his Jewish heritage, help reinforce that Metropolis was film with an angry anti-Nazi message. Perhaps the most impressive thing about Metropolis is the powerfully real way that Lang showed us his apocalyptic vision. The world is scary, because it's realistic, and powerful, because it resembled an interpretation of the world the Nazi's preached about creating. The evidence that the world resembled a Nazi vision are, again, in the religious parallels, this time with the story of Exodus. The film is clear that the world has three divisions, the hand (the Egyptian slaves/the poor), the brain (the pharoah/Joh Frederson), and the heart (Freder/Moses), it is noteworthy that the story of Exodus is about Hebrew liberation. The film was powerful, because of it's message, but is also one of the most influential of the classical Science Fiction films, and still has a massive impact on films today. Visually the Metropolis was made to be a beautiful paradox that is magnificent, yet equally hellish, this look has been copied numerous times throughout the years. Examples of this are in Blade Runner, Dark City, Escape From New York, and the Matrix. The dark yet beautiful apocalyptic world would become a staple of futuristic Science Fiction films. Another visual staple of Metropolis was the look of the citizens, specifically the poor, who are a bland, uniform set of people, beaten to submission. This has been used in films like THX 1138, and more recently films like Snowpiercer, and the Hunger Games. Another impactful aspect of the film is Rotwang's metal hand, which has been copied famously in Dr. Strangelove, and Star Wars. There are many more things that Metropolis has inspired over the years, these are many more things that Metropolis has inspired over the years, these examples were just a few examples of the impact of Metropolis. Regardless of one's opinion toward the film itself, it seems self-evident that Metropolis remains one of film's shining moments, as proof that art can reflect and even criticize culture. Metropolis also remains timeless, because it offers viewers the opportunity to enter the mindset of a skeptical German during the rise of Nazi power. Metropolis' footprint still heavily affects films today, that, and considering the message's enduring relevance, make Metropolis one of the most influential films of all time.",

If you can only give its makers the credit for what they achieved in the era of no CGI or any other modern tech. The sets are huge, the screenplay is good, sometimes really good, the story is engaging, except that this movie doesn't make sense, if we watch it in the era of modern cinema. The normal movie goers, I rather say the people who go to movies, just for fun will not take it. YES, it is outdated, but that doesn't make it bad. The Meta critic rating of above 9 shows that. I rate it at 8 for its pure genius and heart, but it doesn't fit today's cinema and funny thing is that no one has told us to fit it either. I went through many reviews, including that of Sir Roger Ebert. Every one has high praises for the movie, but I personally feel that there were many other greater and better movies than Metropolis at that time. Some of them are ""M"" , ""City Lights"" , ""Modern Times"", ""The General"" that don't have time or era boundary as this movie has. They still are fresh and every normal person can enjoy them. I rate METROPOLIS at 8, but only for what it meant at that time and its message. No wonder if anyone will fall asleep in their sofa now a days.",

I think too many people think of the really creaky silent films from cinema's beginnings--like ""The Great Train Robbery"" or those first experimental films by George Melies--when they think of silent film. But remember that ""Metropolis"" came out in 1927, the year the industry transitioned to sound; so really, the only thing separating this movie from some of the most beloved films of the early thirties is the absence of sound. In every other way, technologically speaking, it's just as polished.",

I watched this for the first time a year ago when I was just turning 13, and from that day, I have loved films. I loved this film so much, I have two copies of the film, the CD, and a bobble head of the machine man. Why is it so good, because it has, memorable characters, phenomenal sets, an influential tone, atmosphere and feel and simply because of the effort that went into making this film. That last point really translates on screen. It is not perfect though, and there are those who will not enjoy it, it's main issue is it's contrived and nonsensical plot as well as some cuts of the movie just do not flow very well.

Take for example Dr.Strangelove's gloved hand, Blade Runner's futuristic vision, 2001's uncontrollable machine that is set to destroy man, Frankstein's mad scientist and more recently Gattaca's class-divided society. The vision for all these classics partly derives from this silent German classic which was probably the most expensive made till that time. It holds the honor of being the first film on the UNESCO ""Memory of the World-Register"" list. Metropolis is stunning whether viewed as a great step in cinematic history and achievement, an inspirational sci-fi movie, an epic battle of good and evil, an expressionist masterpiece, a visual tour-de-force or a religious allegory. Unfortunately, despite great care in restoration, the best version available, in fact the only one that does justice to Fritz Lang's original vision, is the 2002 version now available on DVD. Entire chunks of the film have been lost forever and even this most complete of versions is barely 3/4ths of the original release. However, narrative text helps in bridging the gaps.",

A cross between science fiction and film art, Metropolis takes place in a futuristic city that's inhabitants are divided into an upper class and a worker class. The upper class is referred to as the ""head"" or brain that designed the city. The workers are the ""hand"" that built the city and are responsible for running the machines that keep it alive. Freder, the son of the man who designed the city, meets a woman from the worker class, Maria, and they fall in love. Maria believes that the two classes need a mediator to help with communication between the classes. Otherwise, they will forever be divided. Could Freder be that mediator? Although Metropolis was created in the 1930's, the film looks into issues still relevant in today's world such as the differences between socioeconomic classes and the question of if advancements in technology are better or worse for society.",
128,7 March 2018,Bored_Dragon,8, The mediator between brain and hands must be the heart!,"In 1927, Austrian director Fritz Lang released the SF drama ""Metropolis"", movie that Hitler and Goebbels liked so much that they offered him status of a honorary Aryan, despite his Jewish origin. For its time, this film is a marvel of cinema and it's really hard to believe it's so old. It is considered one of the greatest films of all time and has had a great influence on the future of the genre. The city of Metropolis in DC Universe was named after this film, and design of C-3PO from the ""Star Wars"" is based on this robot. There are also futuristic cities from ""Blade Runner"" and ""Dark City"", Tim Barton's Gotham, as well as many crazy scientists who strongly resemble this from ""Metropolis"". After the premiere, the film was butchered by shortening and for decades it was thought that about a quarter of the film was forever lost. In 2008, a damaged but complete copy of the original film was found in Argentina, which was combined with a shortened version and the film was reconstructed in its original form. The story is a futuristic version of the biblical ""Tower of Babylon"", placed in 2026. The film was extremely high-budget for its time, and some of the special effects invented for this film are still in use. Nevertheless, in its time, this movie was failure and it almost bankrupt the studio. ""Too bad that so much really artistic work is wasted on this manufactured story"" - Variety. ""A technical marvel with feet of clay, a picture as soulless as the manufactured woman of its story"" - The New York Times. H.G. Wells called it the silliest movie he had ever seen, with a sort of malignant stupidity. ""Metropolis, in its forms and shapes, is already as a possibility a third of a century out of date."" I personally liked everything except the fact that the movie is extremely slow. Not slow in terms of lack of action and idle, but leaves the impression of slow motion. After about an hour I set the player to speed x1.5 and the movie suddenly became much better. Although scenes of chasing that way look much like Tom & Jerry cartoons, everything else looks more natural than in its original speed.",

I was lucky enough to see it on a big screen last week and was mesmerised by it. Hollywood is the famous American film city but this film is German and that has to be borne in mind at all times. The reason for my title is simple. The film is the greatest silent film I have ever seen and is silent films at their zenith. However, as it was released on 10 January 1927, silent films were coming to their end and when ""The Jazz Singer"" was released on 6 October of that year they were soon rendered obsolete.",

I do think its great on certain levels like the sets are incredible and I think the visual effects stand up pretty well over the course of time but the one thing that obviously stands out is Langs vision. He was definitely ahead of his time and nobody else had stories like Lang. Some of the scenes in this restored version are still so clear that they look like they were filmed recently. At least on the big screen they did. I don't think this is Lang's best film by a long shot. My favorite is one that doesn't get mentioned enough, ""M"" with Peter Lorre. But this is still a visual treat from a great visionary director. I think it is a little long and certain scenes drag but this is definitely a film that should be viewed by all.

""Metropolis"" is an all time classic which induces creative imagery and a dehumanizing montage of robotics into an eerie genre of sensationalism!! This dismal drama is accompanied with lingering classical music theatrics!! The finalization with what we associate with the effervescence of the human spirit has assertively besieged all of society, and heartfelt emotions have become reduced to the precarious improvements of biological progress!! This German film which was made in 1927, perpetuated the trepidations of many people who feared the social pitfalls of mankind!! On the horizon for Germany, was the ubiquitous monster of triple digit inflation, hence, it would stand to reason that they would just engage in a pejorative dissertation concerning the total demise of man's world altogether.. Start with the fact, that in this computerized citadel of negative Utopia, the prevailing moral debasement which afflicted everyone, merely compounded man's insatiable lust!! The perplexities of day to day living evoked a desensitizing callousness with Homo Sapien interaction!! Such cynical speculation delves into a rudimentary exploitation of fear, this is so often times an effective tool for preying on the skepticism of human nature!! I thought this film had a particularly astute message concerning the demise of the individual's resolve and resilience!! ""Metropolis"" was a major indictment of our yearning as a society to unabashedly categorize individuals, stigmatize them, and label them as uniform vermin meat!! This disconcerting generalization of the human race ultimately makes the population very uncivilized!! As a result, all of them would functionally cease and desist as people, and become nothing significantly more than generic chattel!! It is man's greatest fear that women will seek vengeance on man, because women perceive men to be the creatures who relegated them to the plight of submissive automatons!! So what if the shoe were put on the other foot? This would be an in-veritable misogynist's's nightmare!! This movie is an utterly scathing jeremiad against our society's hegemony!! I felt that ""Metroplois"" was very well made, and it was WAY!! ahead of it's time!! Given that this film was made in 1927, the cinematography was spectacular!! ""Metropolis"" ""Battleship Potemkin"" and ""Intolerance"" are considered to be the three best silent pictures ever made!! I thought ""Metropolis"" was an absolutely fantastic film!! See this film as an uplifting outlet for intellectual intrigue!!",

The story deals with a perfect definition of what ideology is. The dividing of the classes and why are showed in this film. The religious iconography, German expressionism, and surrealistic elements are just a little of what Metropolis has to offer.

It works.  The elements of a class struggle taking place a scant 100 years from the time of great upheaval in Germany, must likewise be considered within the context of the times of this film.  Lang was right on cue.  While this film lacks much of the modernity of his later ""M,"" it nevertheless is a marvelous piece of work.  The Georgio Moroder version which adds a daring sound track to this dark prophetic film gives it a soft sparkle which stays in the mind, long after the film has been seen. It is just simply amazing.  The controversy over the emergence of the saying, ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" which was used over the gates of Auschwitz, was not of Lang's doing.  Lang was a refugee in the US during WW2 and was reportedly horrified at hearing how this motto was (ab)used.  For a long time,  the film was tacitly censured for this small scene and interestingly enough, it is omitted not only from the Moroder version but from several versions.

Thirdly, on a television, the overpowering visuals seemed more like a clever trainset.

The image of Brigitte Helm ""coming to life"" is simultaneously haunting and provocative. This film inspired thousands of (subsequent) movies and television shows. Director Fritz Lang made this in 1927 (93 years ago!). I have seen it many times since. Upon it's release, Bridgette Helm became a world-wide star in her very first movie. She never set out to be an actress. Her mother had shown her daughter's photograph to people in the movie industry. When Lang saw it, he knew she was the woman to play the starring dual roles of ""Maria: the Woman and The Machine"". I have the utmost respect for Brigitte Helm. The film typecast her. Within less than a decade (and in spite of her fame), she quit acting and did what she always wanted: To be married and have a family. Ultimately, she succeeded in both. She hated Hitler (her husband was of Jewish heritage). They moved to Switzerlandl and she had 4 children. In some ways, she remind's me of Greta Garbo. Both hated interviews. According to her son, the closest anyone ever got to an interview was ""the front door to her house"". For all fans of film, this is a must-see. Truly a classic. Don't miss the opportunity.",

Most of the population are workers who slave underground to keep the massive machine that is the city going while the privileged stay above ground and live hedonistic lives. It is impossible not to see this in Marxian terms, the prols exploited by the capitalist class. At the time of the film's production in Germany, there was indeed a specter haunting Europe and it was indeed the specter of communism. Curiously Lang ends the film with a blatant political statement. He has labor and capital reluctantly shake hands. I find this curious because there is little doubt that for the previous two and a half hours the film depicts the capitalist class in the person of Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel) as seeing the workers as mere automations to be exploited. I think Lang wanted to dodge the political implications of his film. I think he was less interested in ideology than in showing striking visuals of man in the world of machines, of humans as machines themselves, and other humans more like brains without bodies, wet wear blind to anything but production and keeping the hive buzzing.",

And that, for a long time, was the case of Fritz Lang's revolutionary, enthralling silent masterpiece ""Metropolis."" It may have been despised and panned upon its original release and almost forgotten, but now time has caught up with Lang's visions and ""Metropolis"" is recognized as the influential milestone it is.

160,19 June 2021,k844140,9, A true masterpiece of its time and still very enjoyable.,"Metropolis released 94 years ago, and unlike many long silent films of that time it still makes you enjoy every second of it. A legendary film which influenced generations of film makers and references to which we can see either in old movies and in the ones released just recently. It is flawless in any respect, especially because of its age. Metropolis demonstrates us a city created by the true genuises with vivid imagination. It is really unbelievable how they thought up and created such a beautiful and futuristic scenery 94 years ago. Seeing all this alone worth watching the film. Script and the story itself are unique and original for its time. Although we have seen it many times since, but Metropolis was the first. Actors and their characters stand out from many characters of that time, though German directors and screenwriters were always quite ingenious. Each separate character, whether it is a human or not, is memorable and outstanding, as well as the actors who performed them. Visual effects of Metropolis are really one of the best I've ever seen in films older than Star Wars (which is partially influenced by this film) and are the best of their time. The other crew member who made his job perfectly is the director. Fritz Lang is really the one who can show and make us understand the story perfectly without tons of dialoges.",
161,1 July 2003,Zoopansick,7, Enormous Influence,"First of all Metropolis is at it's best when you watch it with the right score (music).  Stay away from the ""MTV version"" that music is awful and doesn't do justice to the movie.  I recommend the newest version on DVD with an attempted recreation of the original score, though that would be next to impossilbe because in the days of silent films the score was provided in the theater live.  Anyways I think that many people have a hard time getting used to black and white films let alone silent ones (speaking of people in my generation), so this movie can't be judged harshly or unfairly on those 2 prerequisites.  If you watch Metropolis with an open mind you will be blown away.  It's a science fiction movie that effectively deals with themes of class, politics, and religion.  The sets and design are amazing to me, because the film was made in 1927 and in fact it's creation almost brankrupted the studio (UFA) which funded it.  The imagery is what Lang is a master at and even if you watch the crummy MTV version you have to appreciate the symbolism and at the very least the sets and imagery.  This movie has made a profound influence on Blade Runner, Star Wars, the Matrix, and many other sci-fi movies that are themselves highly influential. Without Metropolis I doubt any of those movies would have come out the way they did.  In fact I think it's highly suspect if they would have been made at all, especially Blade Runner or the Matrix.  NOTHING was like Metropolis before it's creation and even years after it's creation it stands as unique. I think for it's style and imagery alone it can be considered one of the most important movies ever.  It's story isn't the best, but this is a must see for any movie buff.  Once you watch it, you may be surprised at how many films actually ""borrow"" from it.",

A film impossible not to admire.  Yet each time I have seen it -- four now I think -- I always find myself bored.   The visionary sequences are too few and the melodrama grows too heavy far too often.  Scenes like Maria's flight from Rotwang become overwrought at once and then drag on long enough to be comical.  My most recent viewing was the Hollywood Classics DvD.  With so many restored versions of Metropolis around, the quality of this release was terribly disappointing.

165,29 June 2015,devintheinteresting,10, A masterpiece that should be seen by all who love film,"Fritz Lang's Metropolis is a film I had heard of, and I knew it's cultural impact, but I had never actually seen it. I decided to download it on my iPad and watched the 2010 restoration. I was expecting a good little sci-fi silent with anti cruel government messages. I did get that, yes, but I got much more. The story follows Freder Frederson (Nice name) who is the son of the mayor of a grand city called Metropolis. Freder encounters a woman named Maria who is the caretaker of the worker's children. Freder learns that all the workers live in their own little underground city and are not allowed into Metropolis. Freder confronts his father about this and gets a negative response. His father then fires his assistant Josaphat. Freder then let's Josaphat live at his house, while he goes off to take the places of workers. Freder learns that Maria also runs an underground church for the workers. She is trying to give them faith that a mediator between brain and hands will come and help them. Freder's father learns of this and has an inventor named Rotwang have his Machine-Man take Maria's form and pose as her to crush their faith in a mediator. For 1927 that is a great plot, even today it works. Fritz Lang really takes advantage of this and gives us some of the best direction I've ever seen. The effects are beautiful and innovative. The use of mirrors and double exposure is just wonderful. The performance are good. Some of the actors over act (The men in the yoshiwara during Maria's dance are just the worst), but some of them give good, non goofy performances. The best performance comes from Brigitte Helm. The way she plays Robot Maria is over the top, but because of that, you have to love it. The ways she moves quickly and talks is just so fun and entertaining. The screenplay is well written, even though the dialogue can be pathetic sometimes. The production design is the most iconic thing about the movie. The way the city of Metropolis looks has influenced a great number of films. It was a vision of the future that does exist today. Look at modern New York City and Metropolis. The resemblance is certainly there. Overall, Metropolis is well directed, interesting, vision of the future with important social commentary. I give a 10/10",
166,31 October 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, Spellbinding from start to finish,"I base this upon the version that runs just under two hours in length. This is my second exposure(the title that was the first is M, from 1931) to German expressionism and Fritz Lang, the cinematic genius, and it most definitely will not be the last of either. I could not take my eyes off this for a second. It would be a lie to claim that I could remember when I was last this engaged by a motion picture that I was watching, and I'm honestly not certain that I expected it to be as excellent in that aspect as it turned out to be. Cinematography is masterful. This is incredible for how influential, groundbreaking and unconventional it was when they made it, but not only that. The pacing is spot-on, this is never boring. It is not for everyone, and casual movie-goers may not be as captivated by this as I was. It's cut surprisingly fast, and it all goes far beyond what you'd expect them to be able to accomplish at the time. Heck, not only that, the effects are genuinely marvelous, and this holds amazing images that I've not seen anywhere before or since. This, with the futuristic city and the massive machines, has an astonishing, often bleak, look and feel, and builds atmosphere remarkably well. The moral holds up to this day, as does the commenting on industrialism(to an extent) and capitalism(much moreso). This is a silent film(for those unaware, dialog is handled by a black screen with white text on it, and in this, so were a number of stage directions), and apart from some sound-work, all of which is impeccable, the audio side is exclusively music, and this sweeping, instrumental score fits every frame of this, and probably had its role in me being so drawn into this. This is set in the aptly named Metropolis, decades from now(it was when this was made), where the working force, that keeps it all running, is living underground, while the high class spend their lives in carefree enjoyment. Until one day, where the son of the man who planned it falls for a woman trying to improve the situation for the laborers. The acting is impeccable. I recommend this to anyone whose appreciation of the medium goes beyond taking in one or two now and then. 10/10",

I don't think it was because people weren't prepared for such a revolutionary movie. As far as I know, even then few were the ones who weren't marveled with the futuristic and highly stylish visuals. I can't say for sure, but I think it was because it combined futuristic scenarios with still primitive cinema techniques (which were what was available at the time). And quite honestly, the ancient cinema techniques is the aspect which this film is most dated. The stunning futuristic visuals haven't aged at all. I'd dare to say that they wouldn't do ugly now.

175,9 May 2011,jrmontalvo3,8," Metropolis, Greatest Sci-Fi","Metropolis was a movie in the silent era, also in the era of German expressionism where during the period of recovery following World War I, the German film industry was booming. However, because of the hard economic times, filmmakers found it difficult to create movies that could compare with the lush, extravagant features coming from Hollywood. So keep in mind while viewing this film that it was placed in the German expressionism period. In Metropolis it is placed in a futuristic city, in this futuristic city many people put in hard working hours to keep the machines working, so that there city doesn't fall apart or cause mayhem. The story takes place following the son of John Frederson who is the master of Metropolis, the son wants to find a woman he met and express his love to her, but his father will not allow him. Throughout this movie, the son switches place with a worker and endures the hard working conditions that a lot of the employees can't even handle. Later in Metropolis, you find out that the evil doctor has created a robot that can transform into the sons love, and this robot pretends to be the woman whom everyone looks up to. Towards the end of the movie the robot causes a riot by shutting down the machines in order to stop the factory from working, once the citizens succeed little did they know that by doing so the kids they left at home would be in grave danger of being flooded out. Luckily the true lady and John's son save all the children and the citizens get the robot and destroy her.

In striking black and white the film's panoramic view of pharaohnic sets showcasing titanic machinery and technology with the awesome display of urban modernity form an aesthetic backdrop to the human and social factors that form the heart of the movie. Touching on human relations the film is an attack on capitalism and the dehumanizing effect of the daily grind on the common man in the big city. The film's inclusion of one of the earliest depictions of Sci-Fi onscreen is a marvel of filmmaking and technology that adds further to the appeal and timelessness of the flick. With the size of the work and its far-reaching scope excess unsurprisingly follows and whatever merits the film have are much diluted by its excessive length.

One day, Freder ventures into the area of the machines, where workers are forced to work grueling ten hour shifts before returning to their small, overpopulated city, which by the way is underground, away from the privileged. The only thing keeping the workers from revolting is Maria, a young woman who preaches a mediator who will serve as the ""heart"" between the head and the hands. Freder becomes this mediator, although it is not without a serious threat to the entire city from Rotwang, a maniacal inventor who plans to destroy Metropolis. Full of biblical allusions such as the Tower of Babel, ""Metropolis"" sets the precedent for all science fiction. The ""Matrix"" trilogy is a perfect example of something that owes its existence to ""Metropolis"". The visuals are absolutely stunning when one considers that this was made 80 years ago.

The special effects used in this magnificent piece of cinema were way ahead of their time, as was the prophetic message. ""Metropolis"" is an absolute must-see for the student of film and for anyone else interested in film history and culture!",
193,2 May 2020,zeekwunlau,8, A little thinking,"As a sci-fi masterpiece, this metropolis has a profound impact on future sci-fi films.
The climax of the film is the outbreak of the flood. A group of workers who have lost their minds with the excitement of music are destroying equipment. Workers who have been in a state of being squeezed for a long time have no time and energy to think independently under the burden of constant physical work, which makes them numb. Such a group of already rebellious workers began to lose their rationality and destroy underground factories under the influence of malicious incitement and collective herd psychology, causing a huge disaster, but soon afterwards attributed the fault to the robot Maria. And happy to forget afterwards. This also shows a bad mental state of people.
The foreman is the key figure in this riot. As a whistleblower in the early stage, he later used the image of a wise man and a leader to guide the instigated masses of workers and finally shake hands with the capital class on behalf of the working class. This is an over-ideal ending.
There is a story about Noah's Ark in the chapter of Genesis of the Old Testament of the Bible. God decided to use the flood to wash the world because of the serious sins of the world. The flood here has the same effect. Mary, who has the same name as the Virgin Mary, played the same role as Noah in this flood. They retained the most promising seeds.
Does Fredson, who indirectly caused the flood, represent God. In the early part of the film, there are a lot of shots of him looking down from the high floors of the building, which represents his highness. As the creator of this city, he has a very high status. But he is clearly different from God. In the Old Testament of the Bible, God created everything to control the power of life and death, but he only resorted to it when the world was full of sin, and Fredson acted entirely out of the anger that the workers were not under his control. He has similar rights but no similar mentality. Man can never be a god.
Like the Tower of Babel mentioned earlier in the film, the Tower of Babel is the transit tower built by Babylon. The establishment of the transit tower is due to the king's selfish desire to reach heaven with the height of heaven. Praise from those in power, but the original intention, whether right or wrong, will become a curse after causing pain for tens of thousands of people.
This film uses sci-fi religion to express social issues, expressing the obvious and profound opposition between the working class and the bourgeoisie, but in reality will there be the same beautiful ending as in the film?",
194,2 March 2007,Cristiano-A,8, A masterpiece,"One of the greatest works of German Expressionism. In the near future, the world is divided in two: the thinkers, those that do the planning and know nothing about the real functioning of things; and the workers, who reach objectives, but do not have global understanding and know nothing about planning. Alone they are nothing but together they make a strong ensemble. This super-production for the time, with scenarios of an entrancing architectonic grandeur, Metropolis is a pessimistic utopia on the future, that only love can redeem. It's a metaphor on the struggle of classes, a renewed vision of the parabola of Babel, Metropolis is smashing in its scenarios but in the same way, is dramatically emotional and human. The excellent restored copy I saw, allowed me to see the brilliant cinematography, all the games of light, the dark - bright fluctuations. I think that the limitations imposed to filmmakers by the nonexistence of sound and color, sharpened its ability to take the maximum from light effects and from the facial expressions of the actors. Seeing Metropolis today is not the same of seeing it at that time, because the technique evolved immensely. But for that time, it was brilliant. And the movie became a eternal and the android female figure of Metropolis, Maria, is now a symbol of science fiction cinema. While some criticize Fritz Lang , saying that the film is an apology of capitalism and even Nazism, he said: ""I was convoked by Goebbels (...) to know, for my great surprise, that the Minister of the Propaganda of the III Reich had been charged by Hitler to offer me the direction of all the German cinema.

The ideas of class division may still be relevant in 2026, there can still be great inequality even in the most powerful nations and there are attempts to bring them together. If you think the film is a cliché, remember this established many of the clichés, such as the mad scientist with wild hair and the robot hand. There is basis in H.G Wells and older works, but the way this film is brought together makes it a still enjoyable work out of its own century.",

Until the early minutes the plot intrigues and the next 150 minutes flow without boring. Scenography and the futuristic and finely made environments project the viewer in the dystopia of Metropolis; city in which, Fritz Lang, skillfully mixes architectural and industrial elements of the Twenties with medieval elements and religious references: robot burned at the stake, machines transformed into ancient divinities, the emblematic tower of Babel and the Rotwag's alchemical laboratory.

200,26 April 2020,krational66,8," Earth, Heaven and Hell","Metropolis is a ""black hair"" production, one of fritz lang's best-known narrative science fiction films.
It was an unreal world, set in 2026, 100 years after the work was produced. At that time, industrial society was mechanically divided into two worlds. In the above ground world, people live a luxurious and decadent life, the ground is full of twisted skyscrapers, gardens, fountains, theaters, sports grounds. In the paradise called YOSHIMARE, Fred, the son of the owner of the factory-like metropolis, plays with the women in the garden until the gate is opened and Fred is attracted by the simple but saintly maria, who is so different from the women he knew before. Around her were children living underground. She leaned over, pointed to the people in the garden and told the children, ""look, these are your brothers.""
In search of this haunting woman, Fred goes underground for the first time, to the ""hands"" of society. He was completely shocked by the infernal conditions in the underground and the heavy and uninterrupted labor of the people for ten hours a day. Even stopping for a few seconds is a risk of an explosion.
In the midst of this drudgery, Mary, appearing as the savior, is planning a plan. She told the workers a story, the story of BABEL tower. In the story, a man conceived of building a BABEL tower that would reach to the sky, but he was unable to build such a tower himself, so countless working people were sent to build the tower, which was a personal tribute, and to live a miserable life. They build brick by brick mechanically, but no one ever tells them what they're accomplishing; And the people who came up with the idea continued to live their own decadent lives, regardless of the lives of the builders.
Maria's attitude was neither one of total blindness to strikes and violence nor of humble submission to servitude. What she needs to do is to find and wait for the mediator between the head and the hands (Mittler). Only the heart is the mediator between the head and the hands. Only through heart-to-heart communication can the bridge of peace be built between the hand and the brain.
Oh, and here comes the mediator, frates.
Maria and frates fall in love, but frates's father, freudsen, is afraid that the workers will plot a revolt, so he goes to the inventor, rotwan. They once fought over the same woman, Fred's mother, Hel. Rotwan is building a robot that looks exactly like Hel. In order to prevent maria from leading the workers, fredson lets rotwan build a robot that looks exactly like maria and tries to sabotage the workers' plans by seducing them in this way.
Little did he know that rottwan had other plans. He wanted to get rid of the fredsons and destroy the world. He orders false maria to destroy both the earth and the earth with 7 deadly SINS. False maria then on the ground to make people infatuated with her, then kill each other; Underground, the workers were incited to stop work and destroy the machines, causing a major disaster and flooding into the dungeon.
The real maria escaped from rotewan's lab and, along with Fred, rescued the workers' children and stopped the flood, but the workers still misunderstand that the real maria caused the disaster. They caught the fake maria and set her on fire. Fred finally duels with lotwan and saves maria from him. In the end, fredson and the workers shook hands under the mediation of their son and maria.",

Its a futuristic dystopian masterpiece about a world in which the rich live in beautiful glass palaces, ignorant or otherwise indifferent to the plight of the majority of the population, impoverished and overworked manual laborers who are relegated to living in a subterranean inner city. Note the Marxist undertones, which are not at all subtle. The political commentary of the bourgeoise vs. the proletariat, and the classic David vs. Goliath theme are well conveyed. It was beautiful, and totally lives up to its praise as a ""visionary masterpiece."" Fritz Lang is a cinematic genius, and the emotion flows beautifully from darkly comedic to hysterical to somber.

202,18 October 2020,EddyTheMartian007,7," Fritz Lang's unforgettable, though flawed, achievement.","(2010 Restoration at 24 FPS) One of the most influential films of all time. The sets, scale, and effects are truly impressive and the movie still looks great today. The Sci-Fi elements used are fascinating, and it's certainly understandable why similar Sci-Fi elements are used to this day. I still don't know how they pulled it off in 1927. It has some relevant themes about class conflict still used almost a century later, though executed in a flawed manner. The problem is the rich and the poor are shown to be almost equal, only needing a mediator to seemingly fix everything (though how they work together at the end is left ambiguous). It's as black and white as the movie itself, the rich are using the poor as slaves to power their machines, a simple agreement doesn't seem feasible the way it was portrayed. On top of that, It feels disingenuous that a revolt wasn't something from within the people, but a scheme by a villain. The way the entire storyline is presented is quite simplistic for today's standards, though it is forgivable as it was revolutionary at the time despite initial mixed reactions. The acting is hard to judge as sometimes it was hard to take seriously with the over acting from most actors (apart from Brigitte Helm, who totally sells it), though obviously a product of its time. The movie also feels too long, like it could've easily been shortened with a faster pace. It definitely deserves praise for its visuals, and influence, but the movie is quite flawed having some pretty shallow characters, an underdeveloped romance, weird character decisions, and even plot holes, like how certain characters get to places. Yet despite its problems this movie remains mesmerizing, and entertaining almost a century later. Fritz Lang has definitely crafted an unforgettable achievement.",

With the look later adopted by ""Minority Report"", ""I, Robot"", and practically everything of the sort, Metropolis is ruled by Joh Fredersen, whose son Freder enjoys the privileged life of the Club of the Sons and the entertainment district, among other things. One day, Freder ventures into the area of the machines, where workers are forced to work grueling ten hour shifts before returning to their small, overpopulated city, which by the way is underground, away from the privileged. The only thing keeping the workers from revolting is Maria, a young woman who preaches a mediator who will serve as the ""heart"" between the head and the hands. Freder becomes this mediator, although it is not without a serious threat to the entire city from Rotwang, a maniacal inventor who plans to destroy Metropolis. Full of biblical allusions such as the Tower of Babel, ""Metropolis"" sets the precedent for all science fiction. The ""Matrix"" trilogy is a perfect example of something that owes its existence to ""Metropolis"". The visuals are absolutely stunning when one considers that this was made 80 years ago. With these visuals and a great story, even someone who doesn't much care for silent cinema will find ""Metropolis"" worth watching.",

I remember that they found new footage in Argentina that was considered lost before. Unfortunately, the possibly most important scene of the entire movie, namely the fight sequence between Fredersen and Rotwang is still missing. I really hope this one reappears at some point as well, even if chances are slim. Anyway, Fritz Lang and Thea von Harbou have come up with some of the biggest silent film classics, especially in terms of European cinema. von Harbou was married to Lang when ""Metropolis"" was made and she was married to Rudolf Klein-Rogge earlier as well, the man who plays the evil scientist in this film. It's pretty sad to see that there is an abrupt ending to Lang's and von Harbou's streak of success when Nazis took over in Germany in 1933. I mean they still made movies, but their most famous works were from before that era. Of course, this makes totally sense as ""Metropolis"" is a film about the importance of equality and tolerance, while making a statement against violence.

All who complain about the lack of speed in many of the scenes should make sure to see the film again in its original speed of projection: 24 frames per second!

227,3 November 2009,GeneSiskel,3, Not the Perfect Sci-Fi Movie,"The print illustrated here is neither fish nor foul. It is neither the original 153-minute version of ""Metropolis"" released in 1927, nor the 210-minute version unearthed in Buenos Aires in 2008, nor apparently any other version described in the Wikipedia article on the film. Coming in at just under two hours, a number of the original subplots have thankfully been omitted. The musical accompaniment here works well enough, but it is by Serge Prokofiev instead of by the rather less well known Gottfried Huppertz, who composed the original soundtrack. Regardless of what version we have here, the plot is -- let's admit it, shall we? -- an embarrassing muddle. Lang himself disparaged his own film. It can hardly be a positive recommendation that Goebbels loved it when it was released and that the Nazis later co-opted the theme of the workers' struggle against the ruling class spun out in this simple morality play. The acting has all the subtlety of an 1870 melodrama or grand opera by Meyerbeer, but if you hunger to watch a female android perform the hootchy cootchy at the front of a worker's uprising, well, you've come to the right place. Except for a pioneering use of models, the production values of this film appear to have progressed little beyond what D.W. Griffith accomplished a decade earlier in ""The Birth of a Nation"" and ""Broken Blossoms."" And the vision of the future seen in ""Metropolis"" and so beloved by sci-fi enthusiasts? It may be prescient for its reliance on Bauhaus and art deco design, but it is pretty much hopeless for everything else. The airplanes, automobiles, formal dress, and dance styles of 2026 are all straight from the 1920's. Chemistry and electric generators, just beginning to give way to physics, electronics, and biotech in the 1920's, are seen as still governing science and industry a century later. Finally, the quality of the ""Restored Authorized Edition"" seen here is poor. It should be 16mm film, but when viewed on a computer it lacks clarity and definition. Every film lover should see the classic silent films at least once. It's part of a general education. I'm just not sure that every film lover needs to see this version of ""Metropolis"" right now.",

The film's message resonates with viewers of all ages, and it's prophetic view of the potential of unchecked future societies is one we must all be aware of. Especially when you consider that Adolf Hitler used this film as inspiration for his horrific attempt at a global dictatorship and racial sterilization. The effects are ahead of their time. No one got more out of what was available to him than Lang in this film. I can not imagine how anyone enjoyed this film in any of it's previous versions.

For a silent, 88 year old, black and white film, I wasn't expecting anything spectacular. However the presentation, acting, special effects were done quite well and I would have been mind blown if I saw this film back when it came out. Even looking at how many films, books, games and various other aspects of sci-fi works, this film has influenced and amount of material the story covers is phenomenal. Maybe my lack of knowledge of older films doesn't allow me to fully grasp the evolution of modern cinema, however this film has both made me look and think about the potential of technology, human emotion involvement across many aspects of our world, how religion and hope affect human behavior, but also the divide of classes the society creates. At time of release these things were far more relevant, but regardless all of these aspects of the world can be seen today and will be for many years to come.

246,25 March 2022,springfieldrental,9, The Beginning of Sci-Fi Dystopian Epics,"Film director Fritz Lang's ambitious film, January 1927's ""Metropolis,"" is where all roads of today's science fiction dystopian movies lead from. Lang's unique images of man slaving over mighty machines while they're subjugated to those iron-hearted beasts are shown brutally on display. The German director displays almost robotic humans in their daily work facing conditions of a cold, technological environment designed by calculating industrialists. ""Metropolis"" introduced these themes to contemporary films such as 'Blade Runner,' 'Escape From New York,' 'The Matrix,' 'The Hunger Games,"" modern Batman movies, and countless other sci-fi motion pictures. Lang nailed this unsentimental world by shoveling in a heavy dose of Germanic Expressionist stylistic touches throughout his narrative. Added to that are ""Metropolis's"" stunning modernistic buildings, seen above and below ground. They were designed with the help of Lang, whose young architectural background contributed to their look, and have influenced sci-fi cinema ever since its release.",
247,13 April 2008,keesha45,8, Fritz Lang's heart unites his head and hands herein,"While this is not my favorite silent film, it definitely rates in my top ten silents. I enjoyed Chaplin's futuristic vision in MODERN TIMES much better, but Lang created a marvelous tale of what he felt the future (and our present, more or less) might be like. I saw this film at our neighborhood Garland Theatre last night. The print was advertised as the longest version yet to be restored and I wished I had seen more of the scenes that were hinted at by the titles, but sadly missing from the screening. The score was provided by a musical duo called Enuma Elish, which is touring the country accompanying the showing of METROPOLIS in other cities (You can access their work by going to www.lithiq.com.) The music, though a bit loud for my taste, was very good at adding a futuristic techno beat to enhance the enjoyment of the movie. I heartily recommend this showing if it becomes available in your area. I commend the Garland for the screening of this and all older films. I enjoy the availability of watching old movies on venues like the Turner Classic Movie network and of having them being sold in the DVD and VHS format for seeing at home. But there's nothing like the thrill of seeing a film on a large, theatrical-size screen, surrounded by an appreciable audience, as the producers intended them to be shown. I look forward to seeing more oldies but goodies in the future and I urge you to take advantage of the same opportunities when they arise. Dale Roloff",

So many confusing points were cleared up by this careful reconstruction of a film that never should have been cut up for any reason. I'd already seen Metropolis a couple of times and found it fascinating but muddled; this version, on the big screen in glorious black-and-white with its original soundtrack, is electrifying. Although the acting (particularly Freder) is stylized almost to the point of unintentional hilarity, for the most part the performances are gorgeous - Brigitte Helm is astonishing, playing two roles as the sprirtual Maria and her feral, hypersexed robot-double.",

So we all have to thank Metropolis for everything it has done for us. I say you get the Complete Metropolis from Kino International. It will blow you away and the film will make more sense. I recommend to Science-fiction fans or just movie fans in general. It is one Heck of a ride filled with pure entertainment.

Metropolis is science fiction, but it's much more than that.  It is passion and obsession, good vs. evil, the weak vs. the powerful.  It challenges the viewer to really consider what the future may be, but what's truly amazing is that the vision of the future in 1927 may still become our future today (in a sense).  This movie transcends stars and quotes, it is simply a work of art that cannot be missed.

Despite being the most expensive silent film made up to that point, it was a commercial and critical failure. Now after being partly restored, audiences can finally enjoy this beautiful film. However, this film may be a bit of a challenge for common audiences. It's hard to fully appreciate the significance of the film without having seen movies made before it. For those who love silent films, this one won't disappoint. The movie is set in a futuristic utopia that is powered by underground workers. After the city's founder's son, Freder, stumbles upon the underground city, he is determined to alleviate the worker's plight. This bizarre reworking of Marxist ideology turns into a beautiful story of cooperation and peace between social classes. Yes, it's sentimental and like all silent films the acting is melodramatic but it also has a special relevance to today's audiences. It's majestic score serves as the pulse of the rapidly moving film. For those who haven't seen it, it won't leave you disappointed.",

This development falls short of the expectations, given the film's option to explore grandiose scenes, special effects and scenes with countless extras. I have seen many dozens of silent films and there have been many who, on the whole, captivated me more than this ""METROPOLIS"" despite acknowledging the merits of the film. But I still think ""M"" is Fritz Lang's great masterpiece, at least from the films I've seen so far from this excellent Austrian filmmaker. In fact, Lang himself found the same (he himself says it in the film ""LE MEPRIS"" directed by Jean-Luc Godard, in which he participates as an actor whose character he plays is himself).

""Metropolis"" was being shown on the local PBS channel, which touted the viewing as a 50th anniversary special.  I was equally blown away with the effects in both movies, and even more impressed that the effects in ""Metropolis"" still have the ability to mesmerize me to this day.  I was also able to track down a copy of the book, and have found the Moroder restoration the better version I've seen (yes, soundtrack, tinting, and all.  The music and tinting add an extra layer and help move the story along better).  The movie also shows how acting in a silent film is a lost art; the expressions Brigitte Helm uses as the robot Maria are priceless--the first when she winks and nods after being told her mission, and the second when Freder discovers ""Maria"" with his father.

266,23 May 2007,elisacm,8, See this movie! Great science fiction and commentary on class issues!,"Fritz Lang's 1920s Metropolis is set in a dreary futuristic world where thinkers live in ivory towers and workers live and toil under the city as slaves to machines driven to produce by the thinkers. As the workers buckle under the strain and plot a proletariat revolution, Maria, the movie's heroin, encourages them to turn away from violence and to involve a mediator instead. However, an evil genius with a personal vendetta for the man in charge of Metropolis, kidnaps Maria and uses her likeness to create an evil humanoid machine that incites the workers to destroy the machines that support Metropolis. Lang's Metropolis creates an interesting third dimension to the classic story of class struggle by going beyond pitting upper class (thinkers) against the lower class (workers and doers) and introducing machines and automation as a third class in the struggle. The characters in Metropolis are forced to go beyond examining their relationships with one another and the dependency of the workers on the thinkers and vice versa, but are also forced to examine their relationship with machines: The workers feel enslaved by machines. However, the existence of Metropolis and the workers' lives are dependent on the machines. The evil humanoid in the likeness of Maria tries to tempt and destroy the upper echelons of Metropolis society, as well as the machines that the city is dependent on. While much of this silent film has been lost, plot summaries that have been inserted into the missing parts help pull together the movie so that it doesn't have too many plot gaps. The art deco set design gives this futuristic world an interesting timeless, placeless feel. On the whole, this classic film is interesting, and thought provoking.",

The interior of the house is Tardis-like, with labyrinths of tiny rooms, a laboratory full of neon coils and a vast empty hall. Also in the city is an outsize Expressionist Gothic cathedral with looming gargoyles - or is one of them Charles ""Hunchback"" Laughton? Yes, some of the acting seems ludicrous to us, and the robot's erotic dance seems to involve a lot of shoulder hunching. I like Freder but can't help laughing at his speeded-up, elbow-pumping run. And why must the male characters, including Freder, wear obvious, thick wigs? Though it makes it possible for Joh's hair to turn white from fright as he watches his son fight on the cathedral roof .

293,9 August 2000,Jonno-B,9, The mother of all sci-fi films,"An interesting and fascinating look at German silent cinema, and in particular, how sci-fi got started. This 1926 film is set in the year 2000, and takes the form of the fictional city of ""Metropolis"". Though often considered a pro-fascist film (a claim which Fritz Lang always vehemently denied), there is little to suggest that there is any intended Fascist agenda. The film once again draws on female contrast. For example, the contrast between the ""pure woman"" (Maria), and the ""impure woman"" (the robot Maria), further exemplifying the dichotomy between good and evil. Metropolis paints a negative image of mechanisation, with the machines running the city, yet mankind is worse off. The social critique is also there, with a 3 tier social structure, reflected in the habitats of the classes. The geometric mise-en-scène is seen as a representation of the rigidly ordered and structured society also. Scripted by Thea Von Harbou (Lang's wife), this film can truly be regarded as a landmark, and the first sci-film. Quoted as inspiration by many modern directors, and similarities can be seen in many areas (ie C3P0 was modelled on the Metropolis robot). My advice is to see this movie - its simply fantastic.",

It was playing at the Laemmle in Encino. I was once obsessed with seeing as many VHS versions of the movie as possible in order to get the whole story. I think during those days, the Giorgio Moroder version was the most complete even though the music was absurd. With this new version, I'm confident that I've seen as much of Metropolis as I could ever hope to see.",

296,11 February 2014,phobonnika,10, The 5th greatest film of all time.,"What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? In a futuristic city sharply divided between the working class and the city planners, the son of the city's mastermind falls in love with a working class prophet who predicts the coming of a saviour to mediate their differences. I would like to write an interesting intellectual piece of literature about this one but I think this film is smarter than I am because of how trailblazing, groundbreaking, idea-generating, influential (you get the picture) it was/is. Regardless of if one chooses to take into account the fact that Metropolis appears formally with the numbers one, nine, two and seven beside its name, in that order, Metropolis is everything we have. What do I mean by that? It's a film that silently addresses every facet of society, imagination and human behaviour in 150 minutes like no other piece of expressive art had done before or has done since. The city in which Metropolis takes its name from is one of historically encapsulating vivacity, precision and (happenstance or not) vision. From each remarkable value Metropolis holds, others stem from it: from the setting we can ask ourselves about the models built to represent the city, built from scratch and spawned from a creative blank canvas, in a time before any such city existed or the computer technology to cast it painlessly onto a screen was invented. For many, Metropolis represents the birth of the science fiction genre, and aside from being so much more as mentioned, I feel that this feature of the film needs to be addressed. Even in silence, black and white and from an age that a child of our days would consider near-ancient, the fantastic costume of Maria's transformed character remains one of the most striking-looking fictional hero or heroine after nearly 90 years. Metaphorically, Metropolis is deeply woven with ideas of difference, segregation, oppression and revolution. For its day: it was too long for any profit motive and too outrageous for the realistic expectation to start a momentous chain reaction of a new genre (although, clearly, that was an understatement). It begs the question: was Lang trying to broadcast gospel through allegory? In the end, as the years went by, the answer to that question started to become less and less important. Because above all its philosophy and its painful intelligence, it's entertaining and extremely pleasurable to watch. Each visual is like It's like a larger than life blank canvas pinned up against the wall in a loft apartment, having sludgy acrylics of all cultures, all eras of time, and all walks of life are hurled at it whilst a lover lies on her side and watches with deep blue eyes. Metropolis will always be, without question, the greatest film of cinematography's phase one.",

With that being said, my review will likely be biased. I think I like this film for several reasons. Firstly, I think this is one of the only black and white films I've ever seen that actually makes use of black and white film stock. The contrast between images is so crisp and clean, it is visually stunning and artistically executed. It is an absolute pleasure to watch it for that reason alone; black and white has quite a bit of depth when done correctly; this film is no exception to that rule. ",
300,26 April 2011,cking-37-372041,10, Best movie ever.,"Fritz Lang's The Complete Metropolis is one of the best silent movies of all time. This film was the most expensive of its time and it really pays off, but it is a shame that it was mostly overlooked back in the day. I had the opportunity of watching this film in a screening series and I am so happy that I was able to have that opportunity. I had never heard of this spectacular movie before this, and I can't believe it has taken this long. The movie overall was exciting and haunting at times. The characters were showcased by superb acting and it is very apparent throughout the film the immense skills each actor contains. The film loses no points on acting or over dramatization. The film contains many crazy scenes; it is almost like being inside crazy persons head for a day. The plot is intense and suspenseful; you stay on your toes the entire screening. In addition, this films score is awesome, everything is fast pace, but you still continue to feel like you are in the movie. One of the main characters Hel is just intense throughout the movie and captures the facial expressions of a sadistic human being. I found it very interesting to watch her in the movie because she looked possessed each time she was filmed. When thinking about the time period when this movie was made it is almost remarkable to think that one could accomplish so much with little technology that we have today. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. I greatly enjoyed it and look forward to watching it again soon. This is one of the best movies of all time, and I can easily choose this movie over big newer block buster's such as Avatar. Watch this movie you will not be sorry the visuals, props, expressions are worth everything!",

The restored version(the most complete to date) gives us a glimpse of what Lang had really intended. The countless cut-up and blurry copies of the past should be thrown out (my ""cheap"" version I bought for $5 has entire scenes that are out of focus!). I was anxious about seeing this version since I had seen the Moroder version back in the 80's and was so turned on by the color-tinting and now-unbearable synth-pop music!

303,27 January 2007,general-melchett,7," Great for its day, I'll give it that.","Metropolis could have been even better had it been released the following year, in 1928. The first film with sound in it was released the same year it was made - and a film of its type would need sound to be even better. But it is by no means bad. Who cares about words when you've got a good idea for a film? And Metropolis is a good idea - two societies in a city - one hell-like, one heaven-like. The film is great for its day - the scope is massive for a film nearly 80 years old - possibly the biggest ever at that time. And in terms of quality, it probably beat most films in the 50s and 60s. But Fritz Lang had a huge budget to play with - at that time, two million dollars was enough to send a film corporation into bankruptcy, nowadays being s*d-all. And though the budget is used well and every penny is put up on the screen, you just can't help feeling that this film needed words, and that it would just be taken the p**s out of by stupid young idiots in schools today. Though the odd title card every 30 seconds or so does do a good job of keeping everything on track and the musical score throughout the film does kind of substitute for words and sound, this film, I believe, would have been better if dialogue had been used. But b*lls to that - this film is something that should be respected, and an early realisation of a future society. This film is, in every sense, an epic. 7/10",

I thought the special effects used throughout the movie were innovative, especially the laboratory scene when Rotwang creates the 'Maria' robot. Although the movie was in black and white, I noticed the color of the character's clothing was part of their role. For instance, Freder was dressed in white to portray a good guy.

How would we feel if we discovered that a whole multitude of people were working exhaustingly away so that we could live in the lap of luxury? I would imagine if we ever were to find out, we would be extremely scared and apprehensive to the fact that our lives were in the hands of others. Actually, the way I work, I would probably not be surprised to find out that WE were part of the underground city, slaving away for those above! Fritz Lang's Metropolis was the movie that I devoted my time to. Even being a silent film, it captivated me in a sort of disturbed way. The movie's thesis is stated several times throughout the movie. At the beginning of the film, words popped up onto the screen. They were, ""THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!"". At first, that meant absolutely nothing to me, but as the movie progressed, I slowly began to see how the thesis panned out.",

315,20 February 2011,kbunck,5, The workers wanted a violent rebellion.,"I believe that the workers rebellion in ""Metropolis"" was inevitable, robot Maria only hastened the process not started it. If you recall near the beginning of the movie, when Freder Frederson has first started working with the machines, he hears of Maria through the other workers; who act as though going to hear her speak is the last thing they want to do, after getting off of work. Their facial features and tone suggested, to me at least, that they held little respect for real Maria and her thoughts. When you see the meeting with real Maria, only about eleven workers are there listening to her speech on nonviolence rebellion. Later too, when real Maria takes the workers children to the ""Garden of Sons"" where the rich play, she tells the children to look upon their brothers, indicating that she believes the people of Metropolis are all a family and should be treated as such. This of course, does not turn out to be the prevailing opinion of Metropolis's working class. In the scene where robot Maria has taken real Marias place at the meetings, she attempts to rile the crowd into violent rebellion; the room she speaks to is packed with almost one hundred people. Showing that they would much rather listen to talk of a violent rebellion than that of a peaceful one. In fact they are so entranced by this talk of violence, that in their attempt to make it happen they temporarily forget about their children that are still in the workers underground city. So entranced are they by the thought of finally punishing the rich of Metropolis that they do not stop to question the consequences of their own actions, or why Maria after preaching nonviolence for so long would suddenly change her stance. The only explanation for this is that robot Maria was giving the workers what they had wanted all along a quick way to show their aggression and displeasure to the rich of Metropolis by taking away their pleasures, the machines.",

322,9 November 2020,anirguha-60-851453,8, A prophetical movie made more than 80 years ago,"I recently watched the 2010 restored version of the movie (153 minutes in length). Compared to the present day productions perhaps the movie is no match. But what impressed me are mainly two things - one the tremendous innovation and skill that have been employed to create the special effects for this first every Sc-fi. Secondly the symbolism and the message that it tried to portray is so apt for the present day dystopian world we live in.
For the first point the lack of modern day technology has been very well compensated by innovative ideas and skill to create the visual effects during the sequence of creation of Iron Maria, sequence of Moloch, etc. The set design for the Metropolis skyline, underground worker's colony, the factory itself show an artist's mind and ultimate expressionism.
The film shows the elements of capitalism through the grotesque city skyline where there is not a trace of beauty and nature anywhere. The cityscape depicted an ugly juxtaposition of sky reaching buildings and bridges and fast moving highways powered by machines which are so common in any modern day city today. There is not a semblance of nature anywhere in the entire film, not a tree donning any scene apart from the pleasure garden which is only in the reach of the city's upper class. This so much symbolises the present day world where we have banished the nature with rampant exploitation of the environment for the growth of modern cities and technology.
Now about the prophetical nature of the movie. The film made in 1927 during the Weimar Germany had perhaps foretold where the world would come to in future. We today can realise how true the prophecy was.
The social message of the film is equally potent. Reflecting Marx's communist ideaology the film perhaps hopes that the middle class (symbolised as ""Heart"") will be instrumental in bring the gap between the upper class capitalists (""Head"") and the proletariat or the working class (""Hand""). But the ultimate outcome of the alliance has not been touched upon in the movie. It does not attempt to show any material change either in the condition os the working class or the upper-class industrialists. All it says that the lower and upper classes need to be brought together by eliminating the cronies (symbolised by the evil scientist Rotwang) and that can be achieved only by middle class bourgeois (symbolised by Freder and human Maria) and that bourgeois will be an upper-class anomaly. This is where the movie falls short of the expectations; stating only the means but not ultimate conclusion.",

The operatic, Biblical symbolism is stifling. The characters are underdeveloped. But the worst part of the film is Gustav Frolich's performance as the hero, Feder. It's terrible, even by the standards of the day. Feder is supposed to be a standard, handsome, movie hero (Kevin Costner, Bruce Willis), but Frolich plays him like Hamlet on speed and estrogen. Klein-Rogge is over-the-top as Rotwang, but he is the mad scientist. Brigitte Helm is possessed as the fake Maria, but she's good enough as the real Maria to make you think she's doing it with a twinkle in her eye.

337,27 September 2018,jrc-34401,9, The forefather or Sci-Fi films with a staggering ability to see into the future.,"Before actually writing this review, I had been thinking for several weeks about the film and what exactly I was going to say about it. My first response after seeing the movie was that of hatred, I believed that this film was a ""False God"" among film critics and self proclaimed critics. I felt it was cheesy at first, that it lacked human connection and was just overall pretty boring. But it was not until I actually spent some serious time thinking about the film that I realized I was entirely wrong. One of my favorite movies of all time is The Matrix. I have watched that movie close to 200 times, and I can recite each line by heart and reenact any of the scenes. I find that movie to be absolutely brilliant in every single way, and I never believed any film could come even close to the throne that The Matrix held. After these past few weeks, I think Metropolis may sit in a close second to my favorite movie of all time. Not only was Metropolis the beginning to a new era of films, but it was the forefather of The Matrix, and the comparisons are uncanny. The dystopian society, the reigning of machines over humans, the idea of an underground society, Metropolis has it all. Metropolis is, at almost every point, a masterclass in set design, sound design and story design. The music is flawless, and conveys exactly what is going on in the scene at that given moment. Due to the fact that this is a silent film, the music is arguably one of the most important parts, and it ties everything together in an almost magical way. The sets feel and look real (well, as real as they could be in 1927), and they provide the viewer with an understanding of the cities social classes and wealth without ever literally describing them. But the most incredible part of this film, in my opinion, is the story. It is filled with intense moments, passionate moments, frightening moments and overall a hefty amount of scenes that I felt so enveloped in the story I almost forgot I was in class while watching them. I never thought I could truly enjoy a silent movie as much as I did, but in a way, it didn't even feel ""Silent"". Of course there are no lines of dialogue that are spoken, and to be honest, I didn't even see the need for the words on screen. I felt as though the film was written so well in terms of the actor's actions and expressions that every scene could be understood without ever speaking. One of the more staggering things about this film was it's ability to predict the future, or at least shape it. Being the first well-known sci-fi film, Metropolis clearly sets a path for sci-fi movies to follow in the future. It lays out the idea of a dystopian society in which the wage gap and personal wealth determine how your life is spent, with the rich often seen as being above everyone else, quite literally, in their flying cars and high rise buildings far above the workers in the machine below ground. The film presents the idea of machine dominance, showing that a robot could one day be smart enough to start a rebellion and an uprising. Almost 100 years later, in 2018, this theme is still seen, with the latest advances in Artificial Intelligence and robots with machine learning. A.I. such as Siri or Cortana can now learn their user's speech patterns, make decisions for their user's and almost scarily ""speak"" to users with a distinctly ""human"" voice. In my opinion, Fritz Lang is one of the most influential and brilliant filmmakers to ever live, and I am tremendously thankful that my professor had our class watch the movie that has earned it's spot as one of my favorite movies of all time.",

The best features of the film are the visual metaphors that capture alienation boldly and in impossible to forget ways. Whether it is workers being literally thrown in the gaping maw of capital or the sheer pointlessness of machine with a ring of lights that the protagonists has to point hands towards when they flash the atmosphere this film creates is perfect at capturing the dehumanizing tenor of capital, especially industrial capital.

339,21 April 2022,GusherPop,10," Cinema History, started the idea of Star Wars","Stirred by the visionary power of ""Dark City,"" I revisited Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" and once again fell under its eerie spell. The movie has a plot that defies common sense, but its very discontinuity is a strength. It makes ""Metropolis"" hallucinatory--a nightmare without the reassurance of a steadying story line. Few films have ever been more visually exhilarating. What many of these movies have in common is a loner hero who discovers the inner workings of the future society, penetrating the system that would control the population. Even Batman's villains are the descendants of Rotwang, giggling as they pull the levels that will enforce their will. The buried message is powerful: Science and industry will become the weapons of demagogues. Metropolis"" does what many great films do, creating a time, place and characters so striking that they become part of our arsenal of images for imagining the world. The ideas of ""Metropolis"" have been so often absorbed into popular culture that its horrific future city is almost a given (when Albert Brooks dared to create an alternative utopian future in 1991 with ""Defending Your Life,"" it seemed wrong, somehow, without Satanic urban hellscapes) Lang filmed for nearly a year, driven by obsession, often cruel to his colleagues, a perfectionist madman, and the result is one of those seminal films without which the others cannot be fully appreciated. ""Metropolis"" has not existed for years in the version that Lang completed. It was chopped by distributors, censors and exhibitors, key footage was lost, and only by referring to the novelization of the story by Thea vonHarbou can various story gaps be explained. In 1984 a reconstructed version was released, adding footage gathered from Germany and Australia to existing prints.",

349,21 February 2011,finchy9-976-77969,6, Metropolis,"Metropolis is a German expressionist film made by Fritz Lang. It is a visually extraordinary film for its time. You could almost consider it the Avatar of the 1920's. But then again it's like Avatar in more ways than one. One it spent a ton of money on the set design and production of this movie. It is said that Metropolis spent over half of the studios annual budget just to create this masterpiece, and it definitely paid off. The architecture of the great wonder city is brilliant. It truly grasps the vastness and wonderment of a futuristic city. The story however is not revered as being so in depth. This might have been because Fritz Lang built the reputation of the movie too much, I don't know. All I know is that Metropolis has gone down in history as being one of the most expensive, and visually groundbreaking films ever to be put on the screen, exactly like Avatar. I tend to agree with the critics. I did not think that the story was awful by any means, I thought it explored the aspects such as Christianity and romanticism. I thought the robot was a great human metaphor as people do always appear to be who they really are on the inside. The part of people that only themselves and their makers know is a self that is hardly ever revealed. But as far as the story being silly at some times, and just sort of boring at others, is what really gave it a negative effect for me, and once I got past the awe of the set design I soon became tired of the movie. So I believe the greatest amount of credit goes to the design team here. They are truly the ones who provided the label of ""masterpiece"" to this film.",
350,28 April 2011,eksrox-40-902286,5, Summary and Review,"Metropolis is a film full of symbolism and radial thought. When this silent science-fiction movie came out, it was far beyond its time with the technical side and the conceptual side. German Expressionism is clearly expressed here. The main theme was how technology is taking over the lives of people and their jobs, and how monopolies are not good. It is a long and bizarre movie with a futuristic setting. The movie shows two distinct classes. One is the thinkers and the other are the workers. It emphasizes how the elite live many levels higher than the working class and poor. The workers are depicted as having a mundane, repetitive, cruel, and non-stop lifestyle that is constantly monitored. There is much tension between these two and this leads to an overall revolution and take down of the factory that runs the city. One of the messages it is sending is that people should be able to think for themselves, use their own creativity, and be allowed to move up in the work force. A mad scientist clones the main character, which is a young woman. She represents evil and temptation. Her evil twin leads the workers into revolting and destroying their work place to make a point. They are so caught up in the fact that their life is about to change, they don't take into consideration until the end that they are destroying the city along with the factory, because that factory is what the city runs on.",

It is inarguably the greatest silent film of all time, and one of the greatest of any films of all kind. It is pure genius. Every shot, every composition, every cut is rich with meaning, yet it can be enjoyed just for its beauty and cinematic pleasure with no intellectual reading of it necessary. To fully understand it, however, one should brush up on the history of the brief Weimar Republic of Germany between 1918 and 1933, since the film reflects what the Germans were feeling at the time and is a prime example of the art movements of this period.

355,23 July 2019,kaleidoscope_eyess,9, ahistorical,"My disappointment with Metropolis stems from its failure to understand European history. Aside from a few campy performance, Metropolis qualifies as one of the all-time best sci-fi movies. However, a movie produced in interwar Germany, Metropolis lacks proper understanding of Belle Epoque and the Great War. The first ten minutes of Metropolis is sheer brilliance: it reminds us of everything of industrialization, modernity, class conflict, etc. A tour de force, the few clips are reminiscent of Futurist Manifesto (1909). The problem is, just as the Futurist Marinetti ignores the incompatibility between old regime and new empires, it seems to me that Lang disregards the tensions between empires, races and ethnicities. In Lang's vision, class conflict is the only true problem in a highly industrialized society. Later in the film, he promptly turns away from socialism/communism by showing his contempt for working-class men, depicting them as irrational rioters. It also discomforts me that even after the tormenting WWI, Lang still approaches common people as a group of faceless men without individual needs and shared humanity. I am not necessarily implying that Lang approves of fascism, but his lack of historical perspective mildly reduces my pleasure in watching this film.",

But it's never sentimental or silly. Widely conceived with a huge cast, after all they could afford it in those days and they didn't need CGI. A mad scientist of course. A fascinating robot.

Without Metropolis, movies like Star Wars and Blade runner would have looked very different, and the entire Science fiction genre would have taken a very different route. My only niggle with this film is that it has been so heavily cut over the last 80 or so years, and great chunks of it have been lost forever. This results in a few version of various lengths being on the market, and it is very easy to buy one version, only to find another longer one soon afterwards. Overall, get hold of the longest one you can, then sit back, relax and take in a true classic of the science fiction world. I love this film, and I am sure others will too.",

I was hoping to have my socks wowed off by an incredible classic movie (because of the way our professor hyped it as the silent era's Avatar). Nothing could be farther from the truth. After an hour or so I could barely stand it. Another thirty minutes go by and I begin to seriously contemplate walking out. But I couldn't just leave. It wasn't that I was interested in the movie but I had already invested too much time to leave and not get credit for being there. The last hour was a test of my will. I was antsy and I was jittery but I stayed and I got my damn credit. The movie was not that awful it just didn't warrant two and a half hours of screen time.

368,18 August 2018,Phaeron,10, My New All Time Favourite,"Metropolis covers a range of topics, from social inequality to importance of having good intentions, from love to what it means to be a part of a community, not only this movie from 1927 covers these really fundamental topics to our nature really well, but it also pictures a future that is really similiar to ours with poor people getting poorer and the deterioriating social relations giving way to radical thoughts and ideas. While stating that radical actions are sometimes justified and often caused by other factors, The Metropolis says that no matter what our current stance is, in every action of our life, our heart, our humanity should find the middle ground between our ideals and power. 
 The movie is full of biblical references that I found really refreshing, since they are not made in the most obvious sense, but they make themselves clear enough if needed, unlike these modern movies where we would have any sort of imagery either be pushed through our throats or would be really hard to figure out. I am glad that sort of a middle ground exists.
 Actors have done a magnificent job. Their actions caused me to want to jump with excitement with every new scene, despite not uttering a word. That is art at its purest sense, and for some reason, Josaphat, one of the side characters, really left a mark on me, I don't think I shall forget how grateful he was to the Freder for saving him from going to the lower town.
 The clips are pretty sweet for their time, if you are watching the full version, which includes scenes from clips that were brought from Buenos Aires, you can have a handful of clips that are in lower quality, but they are detrimental to the story, so I don't mind that, and would like to thank everyone and everyone who worked to create this full version.
 Well, story is about two young people who fell in love despite their socio-economic status, the guy being the heir to the ''leader''(?) of the city, things get complicated soon enough and there are few side stories that I don't want to spoil.
 I would recommend everyone checking this masterpiece out even if you are not into old movies, I think you can bear with a silent movie for once in your life.",
369,3 October 1999,EAT Alex,5, A stiff classic.,"It's interesting to analyze what the legendary reputation of Metropolis is based on. Just look at it. What we have here, is a stiff, unintentionally comic and naive picture. The ridiculous gestures of the actors and the stupid texts written by Thea von Harbou would make Metropolis -released in 1927- the camp classic of the century if it weren't visually so damn magnificent. Director Fritz Lang definitely knew the secret of creating unforgettable images. The events of the film take place in the future, somewhere around the year we are living now. Lang tells a story of huge town called Metropolis. The designers of the town live in beautiful skyscrapers, have money and amusements. The ""hands"" of the town live in the heat underground, each man working ten hours a day. Metropolis is as must see, ""because its has inspired directors like Ridley Scott and James Cameron, and films like Blade Runner, The Terminator...""

377,27 April 2011,eabakkum,7, Workers exploitation in Metropolis,"The film Metropolis is famous for its critique on the exploitation of human beings, and as such is intuitively attractive. To be honest, I was told that the approach of Lang is rather sugary, and this has long stopped me from watching the film. However, Metropolis is a produce that you can not ignore. So, here is my review. The film is full of symbolism and myths, but Metropolis itself is simply what its name says. The peculiar thing is that all workers live in underground quarters, invisible to the middle and upper classes. Therefore, the mature son of the residential ruler and chief executive is totally unaware of the divided society, and leads a hippie-like life. One day, sister Maria comes from below together with a bunch of workers children, and shows them the lustrous life above. Maria, as you might guess from her name, is also the high priestess of the workers. She actually holds regular preaches on a churchyard. When the son sees her, he is impressed to such a degree, that he wants to visit her in the underground part of the city. She on the other hand, sees him as the Saviour (don't worry, he will not be crucified). The exploitation has driven the workers into a revolutionary state of mind, but Maria urges them to search for peaceful ways of change. Then the dictator orders his local insane scientist to make a machine man, a robot, which will duplicate Maria and incite the revolt of the workers. The reference to Frankenstein or Hide is obvious, but she also impersonates the human alienation. Apparently the idea is to beat down the revolt and make the workers more pliant. His plan seems to succeed, when the workers destroy the machines in the central power plant, which brings the economy to a grinding halt. In the end the underground city is drowned and the robot is burned on a pile, by the mob who now believes that she is a witch. In the mean time, the real Maria has guided all the workers children to the upper quarters. The scientist is killed by the son, who throws him of the roof of a cathedral. The dictator himself remains in power, but the son fulfills his task as Saviour and reconciles his father and the workers. And of course he marries Maria. The final text urges the viewers to merge hands and intellect with the hearth. Evidently, this abstract shows the many qualities of the film: love, suspension and even horror, battles and mass scenes. The acting is somewhat theatrical. There is lots of biblical and religious symbolism, even references to Babel. The reformation is not depicted as the merit of the working class, who are only capable to revolt and destroy. Actually, the odd worker who escapes from the underground city immediately joins the lustrous life above. It is astonishing, but the real hero and the only man of virtue is the son of the dictator. So the political message of the film has a religious and rather anti-socialist tendency, without being a real plea for democracy. It may be explained by the spirit of the time (1927), when the catholic organizations had obtained a social color and were competing with the socialists. In spite of the theme, I would dub this film a produce and a warning especially for the upper middle class. For the rest of us the message is: don't kill the machine, or your house will be flooded. If you like social films, you might consider seeing my other reviews.",

384,17 December 2001,harleybess,10, If you haven't seen this film you don't know what your missing,Metropolis is about the relationship between the workers who live below the ground and the rich who live above it. It is a story of the two are brough together by love of a rich mans son for a sweet worker girl who preaches against violence.,
385,7 September 2022,atleverton,2, A Silly Film,"There are only two reasons to watch this film. The first is that it is the first sci-fi film ever. The second is that it does have some shots that are brilliant, and it is a marvel they were created almost 100 hundred years ago. The film is more like a ballet than a movie. The story barely makes sense, the message of the film is confusing (the head and the hands need the heart to mediate?) and it is about two hours too long. If you are interested in the great shots from the film, they can be found on Youtube. It's not worth your time watching this. H. G. Wells gave it the most honest review when he said it was a 'silly film'.",

I went into this film thinking it would be one of the best things I've ever seen. Can't help but be a tiny bit disappointed in the film but still impressed with Fritz Lang and the rest of the crew.,
387,18 February 2015,robsta23,9, Great but not a Masterpiece,"This is the first feature we were required to watch in my special effects class, and though I've seen it before (and a longer version of it) I sill have to say I'm very impressed by the effects in this movie. They prove to be better in the context of the time period in which they were used than most CG effects are today in movies such as The Hobbit or Avatar.",
388,26 September 2008,james-reed-3,9, Fritz Lang is a Master,"Fritz Lang's masterpiece of a film is one of the greatest examples of exactly what silent film should be. With gripping plot lines, outstanding special effects for its time, and filmed under the direction of a great mastermind of early film, Metropolis is the film that influenced every science-fiction film that followed it. This film brings superb storytelling and emotional themes together in a beautiful harmony that grips the viewer and does not let go for more than two hours.",

390,21 May 2011,balto_matrix,9, 1920's masterpiece,"Excellent movie from the 1920's. It's one of the myths of the ""Sci-Fi"" genre. Fritz Lang shows a futuristic city, where the working class lives underground and the upper class above the workers zone. We can clearly see the influence of socialist and communist movements in the film. The great photography makes the film even better. It's also good to see the incredible work made by the cast. Star Wars had many influence from Metropolis. You can clearly see that C3PO resembles the female robot from Metropolis. Fritz Lang is one of the best film directors the world has ever seen. The silent film era had a lot of talented artists, Fritz Lang was one of them.",

We watched this is my film studies class yesterday and I felt like I was being punished for something (like in A Clockwork Orange).  Maybe I feel this way because I'm young or because I'm not used to two hour films with no sound.  It's great that there is a movie that so many people like.  I've never seen a list of comments for any movie that didn't have at least ONE negative comment, until I looked up this one! I'm not being negative or criticizing anyone..I just thought it was the most boring thing I've ever had to watch.  This is a movie that would be great for a collection or something but I doubt I would or could ever watch it again.",
392,24 April 2020,f-57307,8, great!,"The visual image is advanced, and it is worthy of being a classic of the era image; the story itself is logically chaotic, the performance is exaggerated, and the details can not be studied.",

394,21 February 2006,timodica,9," Eighty years later, still futuristic, amazing to watch","I am blown away... It's amazing how a simple plot and an easy story can make you think... I'm no particular fan of silent movies. I like my movies with sound and colors. In this one I didn't miss none. The soundtrack, though a little repetitive, gives the movie all the boost it needs and makes you feel sad, joy, intrigued, admired at the right times. The light (and sometimes it's absence) makes you forget the black and white tones. This is one not only for the fans but for everyone to see. Of course you can't forget that you are seeing a silent black an white movie. For those who like action, action and more action movies this one can be dull, sometimes lulling. And those who are used to rely on dialogues sometimes can feel lost inside the acting. I thought fantastic the idea and the concept of the entire movie.",

Since I saw it that first time in my English class I have longed to see it again. The movie keeps you thinking about it for months. I highly recommend everyone see the movie Metropolis because it makes so much sense, and after seeing all the science fiction movies eighty years later, one will be shocked as to how much in the movie is familiar to what we still use in our flicks today. It is clear that every SciFi flick that has come to pass since Metropolis is somehow based on Fritz Lang's brilliant movie. I only wish somebody could find one of the original film cannisters in their basement featuring all the lost clips so we could see the movie in its pure entirety.",
398,30 December 2022,MartynGryphon,10," A magnificent, if not confusing spectacle.","Throughout the history of cinema, there have been many movies that have tanked on their initial release, only to gain a wider, more appreciative audience much, much later for actually being under appreciated and excellent examples of film making. 'The Sweet Smell of Success' was one. 'Once Upon a Time in America' was another and the most shocking in this category has to be 'The Shawshank Redemption'. (Yes folks, believe it or not, that was a box office bomb). The movie I am reviewing today can probably lay claim to have started this trend, as it dates back over 95 years. It is Fritz Lang's 1927 silent movie epic 'Metropolis'.",
399,19 September 2010,eneyeseekaywhy,9, Sci-Fi masterpiece with extra footage.,"Adjusting for inflation, the budget of Metropolis was in the region of $200 million. A more than substantial amount for any studio to pay in 1927. James Cameron's recent Pocahontas-in-space epic Avatar cost close to $300 million. Both are currently on re-release with extra footage added, Metropolis has an extra 25 minutes of film, Avatar has an extra 9 minutes. This is where the similarities end as it's difficult to imagine anyone watching, let alone studying, that glorified computer game trailer 80 years from now.",

401,31 March 2021,CosentinoAran,8, The heart is the mediator between the mind and the arms.,Visionary film at the time. The fundamental message of the film is that the heart must be the mediator between the mind (who thinks and commands) and the arms (the workers).,
402,25 September 2018,aic-09122,8, Intro To Film Class Review,"Metropolis is the first Sci Fi film that was created. It is about a future in a massive metropolis with a heavily divided upper and working class. The movie follows the son of the creator of the metropolis as he try's to unite the working class and the upper class to build a better city. 
This movie is fascinating as most of the visual design and even the special effects hold up well to this day. The physical set design was really well designed and extremely impressive. Even in movies today with CGI and modern effects do they rarely capture the scale of things in such a spectacular way. The hand drawn effects of the movie also still holdup today, like when the various rings around the machine man that had to be painstakingly hand drawn on each frame. The wider shots are equally impressive with the wide views of the city and the moving traffic when showing the exterior areas of Metropolis. It would be very interesting to see the original sets for the movie, I imagine that they spent a lot of effort to produce such large and intricate sets. The verticality in many of the scenes gives a sense of enormity of the setting. The amount of moving parts in the machine rooms gives a hectic but still extremely orderly feeling to the film, which ties well into the massive machine city. A lot of the emotion of the setting can be attributed to the use of so many extras. They sheer amount of people on screen at time really gives a unique weight to the setting that modern films seem to lack. 
Another interesting aspect of this film is the choreography of the extras. Their movement lends to the film a lot of the impact on the audience. When the workers are marching in a monotonous fashion completely in sync, it makes it seem like the workers are no more important than the machines that they tend, and are just replaceable cogs in the machine. When at the machines their frantic movements at the levers and knobs gives a sense of desperation as they try to keep up with the demands of the machines. When the workers begin to destroy the machines they begin to dance in lines jubilantly, even if it may have been misplaced. Another time when this helped the film was when the workers city was flooding and the children kept streaming from the buildings and congregating around Maria added to the panic of the scene. Finally when the mob is chasing Maria and they mix with the doomsday crowd the movements of everyone becomes so chaotic really bringing the movie to its climax. The choreography of the extras gives an extra dimension to the film, and helps convey the emotions present in the film, instead of with dialogue. The synchronized nature of it as well gave the movie a strong sense of what it was conveying, since every person moved with such purpose and precision. Even though the choreography was a necessary thing to do in the film since it was silent, it was so well executed that it really elevated the film, giving it extra depth in what each scene was conveying.
Overall this was a very enjoyable film (and my first silent film). Even with the very limited dialogue it was easy to follow the plot of the movie. The stunning visual design is what drew me to the film, and its clear that a number of other science fiction films, most notably blade runner, took inspiration from this film.",
403,3 April 2020,Mnemosyne15,9, A masterpiece still to be admired to this day,"This is a classic work by Fritz Lang and one of the outstanding masterpieces of German expressionist films. I greatly appreciate the talent of this director. Many shots and clips are admirable! Whether it's a story or a conflict, or a filmmaking scene, such a piece of work makes the audience happy. This is only a work from 1927, which can achieve such amazing results. The power of the film pioneers is really powerful!",
404,27 September 2018,rvm-18257,10," Well done, enjoyable film","Directed by Fritz Lang and released in 1927, Metropolis is considered by most film critics as a ground-breaking classic from the silent film era. It follows various conflicts relating to a futuristic city, it's inhabitants and those who power it behind the scenes while exploring the themes of a society that has been consumed by technology. 
The main external conflict follows Freder Fredersen, a young man who leads a privileged life in the dazzling city above ground, after he falls in love with a woman, Maria, from the dismal worker city below. When he follows Maria underground, Freder becomes disillusioned with the city above, seeing how it is powered by people in the depths who essentially sacrifice themselves to maintain it. In order to better understand the workers, Freder switches places with a man for a shift, after which he attends one of the secret meetings held by Maria. At these meetings, Maria shares a prophecy of a man who will be the mediator between those the overseers of the city and the workers; Freder then decides that he is the mediator the workers have been waiting for. During this, unbeknownst to those at the meeting, Joh Fredersen, the main overseer of the city and Freder's father, was secretly listening in and plans to ensure that the workers will not revolt. 
In addition to this, Lang includes many other external conflicts to keep the audience entertained. For example, there are the workers who struggle against their oppressive conditions, Joh who struggles to contain the workers, Rotwang, an evil scientist who resents Joh after the death of Freder's mother during childbirth, Freder against the Thin Man who is tracking him, and Freder against the chaos that the robotic Maria facilitated. The almost constant addition of conflict adds to the dramatic tension present during the film. As a result, this tension keeps viewers invested in the plot since they crave resolution. The numerous conflicts also add many opportunities for physical activity as the different parties collide. This action also helps to keep the audience engaged throughout the film. With the constant struggle and chaos, Lang also highlights the negatives effects that technology has on a society that becomes obsessed with it.
From the representation of the workers to the robotic Maria, Lang provides different perspectives of the powerful grip that technology has on people. This negative effect is prominent when considering the workers. When they are shown, the tone becomes very dreary and mechanical, especially when the groups of workers are seen walking about. Lang portrays them in large, seemingly uniform groups that shuffle through the city in an orderly manner, emphasizing how dehumanizing the upkeep of the city is. In the factories, they can be seen working to the point of utter exhaustion, merely being replaced if they fail to complete their job. The workers represent the overwhelming oppression technology can bring for the sake of maintaining a certain standard. This intrinsic metaphor is executed effectively through the use of the repeated action of walking in uniform groups and dismal tone. Contributing to the oppression is Joh, who is obsessed with keeping the ideal city as it is, even if it means disregarding the lives of the workers. He, along with the other inhabitants of the above ground city, turn a blind eye to the clear injustice faced by the workers in order to maintain the advanced life they live. Rotwang's creation of the robotic Maria also brings up an interesting dilemma about the extent to which technology could advance and whether or not it will be used for good. The chaotic, lewd, robotic Maria is a direct foil to the actual Maria, who appears kind, wise, and pious. This contrast between the seemingly righteous human woman and the sinful machine woman continue to cast a negative light on technology. Also, when following the robotic Maria, both the aristocrats from above and the workers from below were thrown into discord. The aristocrats where literally starting to kill each other over the robot's affection and the workers destroyed their own city despite the fact that they were risking their own livelihoods' and the lives of their children. These nonsensical reactions ended with the robot being blamed and burned. To conclude, the negative aspects of overbearing technology are definitely expressed by Lang throughout the film, as seen by the different methods he employs. 
In the end, Lang shows a solid application of impactful expressionist ideas through Metropolis, especially considering the amount of external conflict and themes reflecting the devastating effects of technology. He utilizes action, symbolism, and characterization to capture his audience and give his work noticeable depth. The ideas expressed by Lang are also still relevant today, seeing how certain parallels can be made to industries that dominate the present. Clearly, his effort does not go unnoticed since the film has withstood the test of time to become an influential classic.",
405,9 March 2010,wsteinhauer,3, Probably a great film in 1927,"I know this is a classic, and I appreciate what an effort this was in 1927. But watching it now is only for its historical value. We have come a long way in movie making, and this was one of the first baby steps. As entertainment this film is pretty bad, like a Plan 9 from Outer Space bad. I watched it on Netflix and the print quality was very poor. I am not a fan of silent films, the overly dramatic acting is painful. I will admit that it must have blown away audiences in 1927, but this is not 1927. And now I remember why I do not submit comments to IMDb, the ridiculous 10 line requirement drives me nuts! I'm sorry, I can't drag my review out to that many lines.",
406,17 May 2023,fredrikgunerius,10," Influential, monumental and aesthetically flawless","One of film history's earliest triumphs in visual effects and production design, Metropolis still looks and feels magnificent even after a century of ageing. Fritz Lang deployed a record-breaking budget and avant-garde use of miniatures and special effects, most notably the Schüfftan process, in order to create the illusory, dreamlike sci-fi world of Metropolis - a futuristic city in which the division between the lowly workers and the sophisticated upper class has grown to dangerous, tyrannical proportions. We follow the young and idealistic Freder (Gustav Frölich), son of the city's oppressive master, in his search for the truth about his father's reign - and a more substantial meaning to life than idling away at various sheltered past-times. The clash between the privileged and the poor is inevitable in this epic. Still, Lang's depiction of it, and of the film's dystopian society, remains multifaceted, relevant and remarkably universal. The fact that Metropolis was so prophetic for what was to happen in Germany about a decade later is more a confirmation of the timeless validity of Lang and his screenwriter Thea von Harbou's story; a reminder that a totalitarian rule is only ever a complacent society away. Despite this, there is a sentimental optimism to Metropolis which infuses the silent moments and makes it a remarkably satisfying watch in addition to all the impressive extravaganza. One of the most influential, monumental and aesthetically flawless pictures of all time.",
