0,9 July 1999,baumer,10, There will never be another film like Raiders,"It is a hot sunny day in South America. We see a bunch of men, shot mostly from the back. They are walking deep into the forest. We see a tall dark figure. He is wearing an old leather jacket, he has the 5 o'clock shadow looking like it's closer to midnight, he wears a fedora and he carries a bull-whip ( yes a bull-whip ). Finally, two of the men enter a cave and we hear about some guy named Forstall, who was good, very, very good, but he never came out of the place alive. But they enter anyway. They are confronted with tarantulas, spears that are triggered by blocking out the light, a pit that they must swing over and then more tiny poisonous darts that come out of the wall. All this to protect an ancient gold statue. They recover it. One guy dies and the other barely makes it out of the room before it all falls on him. Then he has to get out of the cave and a giant boulder chases him. Finally he makes it out of the cave only to be surrounded by Hovitos and his arch enemy named Belloq. He takes the gold statue that this guy worked so hard for and then the guy runs and makes it to the plane where he is in the passenger seat and there is big snake in the plane. He hates snakes. This mans name? Indiana Jones!",/
1,15 November 2019,acedj,9, When Harrison Ford was crapping gold,"This is the first movie in the Indiana Jones series. It is also the best film in the series. Indy is hired by the US government to track down the sacred arc of the covenant. While he is on his quest the Nazis are also searching for the arc. This is a wonderful adventure story that covers many countries. Harrison Ford was born to play this role, and he does it with flair. After having seen this film quite a few times, you also get to pick out the Easter eggs that are scattered around. One hint is be on the lookout for two well known Star Wars droids.
I do not think that there was a better combination in the 80's than Lucas and Spielberg. This in everything you would want from an adventure movie and more.",r

My local theatre had a special showing last night and the 400-seat screen completely sold out (as Indy films always do). Luckily for me and my pal, we got the last 2 tickets available!

7,19 April 2001,Aaron1375,10, My favorite movie of all time!,"There are few movies I can watch over and over again, but this is one of them.  This movie has it all: action, romance, comedy, and suspense. Harrison Ford is at his best as Dr. Jones, one of the most exciting archeologist ever.  From the start to the end you are hooked to this movie. I love the opening when he as to dodge traps as he tries to get this treasure, I love it when he is running through the streets trying to save the girl, I just love every bit of it.  Spielburg said he wanted a b-type movie like he remembered from his youth, but this far surpasses any b movie and any a movie as far as I am concerned.",/
8,6 December 2004,belzebuebchen,10, A blockbuster how it was meant to be,Nowadays we keep forgetting how beautiful blockbusters can be. Too much CGI makes everything possible and therefore very often also arbitrary. In Raiders you actually seem to feel the physical pain some of the actors/stuntmen had to go through to provide 2 hours of pure entertainment.,r
9,3 September 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," To me, this will always be the best of the Indianna Jones series","For me it is not only the best of the series but one of the greatest adventure films ever made. It is breathless excitement from start to finish, and to be honest I cannot fault it really. The production values are wonderfully evocative, and John Williams's score is outstanding. The script is filled with wit and invention, and the story is slickly paced and exciting. The action is spine-tingling, with booby-trapped caves, snake chambers, Nazi spies, religious demons, damsels in distress and romance, and the special effects are dazzling especially in the superb climax. The direction is effortless, and there is little to complain about the acting either. The part of the unorthodox archaeologist fits Harrison Ford like a glove and Paul Freeman brilliantly plays a smooth villain. Karen Allen, Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies are excellent as well. In conclusion, brilliant and if you haven't seen it do. 10/10 Bethany Cox",w

20,27 June 2020,fernandoschiavi,8, One of the great films of Spielberg's career and one of the greatest adventure films of all time,"It was born from the minds of some of the leading filmmakers of the moment, but an adventure that would become one of the leading film franchises. George Lucas had just created and launched two sci-fi classics with the first two chapters of the ""Star Wars"" saga while Spielberg was also already considered one of the most promising directors in Hollywood having effect astonishing successes with ""Jaws (1975)"" and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) "".",e
21,23 October 2022,RonellSowes,8, Prime Adventure Even If It Goes A Bit Far,"The main intent of Raiders of the Lost Ark is to be a fun adventurous ride and you have to give it that. The film kicks of the action right from the beginning and goes from one to another over the course of the film slowing down only for a moment and keeping exposition to a minimum. However, while the film keeps it all under two hours it does feel a bit much. From the number of set-piece to the size of each. Each one builds from one thing to the next getting more extravagant as it continues into a bit of mumbo-jumbo. This was the start of extensive and wild action scenes in both Spielberg's career and all of cinema. While the movie is undoubtedly a classic, its influence (which is on almost every action movie made after it) has been more negative. Raiders of the Lost Ark tried to make movies funner but it also made them dumber.",f

24,26 December 2020,Bored_Dragon,8," ""I'm making this up as I go""","I believe that there is no need to give a summary of the most legendary adventure film ever made. When you think of Harrison Ford, you think of Indiana Jones. And don't lie you think of ""Star Wars"". It may be a bigger and more popular franchise, but I bet Indiana is everyone's first association. A charismatic professor of archaeology who swings his whip in remote places of the third world, overcomes all obstacles with ease of a comic-book hero, a charmer who seduces women and audiences and who has marked childhood for many generations. Technically excellent, visually impressive (except for the quite silly special effects towards the end), atmospheric, with perfectly balanced elements of adventure, action, humor, and romance. It may not be a masterpiece of cinematography, but with its spirit and influence on the genre as well as on generations of viewers, it certainly deserves cult status.",t

29,14 May 2008,HelloTexas11,7," still a lot of fun, but...","I understand that I may be forgiven for not thinking 'Citizen Kane' is so great, but the following is cinematic heresy- I've decided I'm not that crazy about the Indiana Jones series. They're fun films, no doubt, and there are certainly worse ways to spend a couple of hours. I watched 'The Last Crusade' again not long ago, and last night I watched the first one. At the risk of stating the obvious, what 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' really has going for it is Harrison Ford and a couple of slam-bang action/special effects sequences. Well, you say, for cryin' out loud, isn't that enough? And yeah, I suppose it is. I've just found I'm not nearly as enamored of the series as I once thought I was, and each of the films has flaws that perhaps only become apparent on repeated viewings. The aspect of 'Raiders' that grates particularly each time I see it is Karen Allen's performance. I'm sorry, I don't find her funny or attractive or even interesting. I understand that the idea is for her to be a feisty tomboy, someone who speaks her mind and is ""more than a match"" (as they say) for Ford's Indy. But does that mean Allen's Marion has to be so utterly unattractive, in every sense? At times, she seems more like a gangly, socially-challenged thirteen-year-old who hasn't learned basic table manners yet and who snorts when she laughs. I don't know what's more annoying, her behavior or the fact that every male in the film seems to think she's gorgeous. Granted, she doesn't have any competition... that must be it. So there's that. The film of course was a trendsetter in many ways, resurrecting almost single-handedly the grand old adventure flick. The durable plot elements and (other) characters were made to seem fresh again, from the resourceful adventurer venturing to exotic lands to those most reliably evil of slimy villains, the Nazis. And there is a toughness to the first Indiana Jones movie that seems somewhat lacking in the other two. Both Sallah and Marcus Brody are real characters here, alternately serious and amusing. By the time we get to 'Last Crusade,' the two men are strictly comic relief, and Marcus in particular becomes a scatterbrained buffoon. The climax of 'Raiders,' when it finally comes, was something of a revelation (so to speak) at the time. This was the big payoff, and it didn't disappoint, though it's actually pretty brief. The face-melting and vaporous spirits (to be used to a much greater extent later in Spielberg's 'Poltergeist') had audiences wide-eyed with amazement. And then a clever little epilogue left cinema-goers feeling satisfied, that they'd really gotten their money's worth. I shared all those feelings when I first saw 'Raiders of the Lost Ark;' as I said, it's only been the last two or three times I've watched it that I haven't been as blown away.",v
30,28 February 2022,brianberta,7," I'm no longer the target audience for this film, but still solid.","Before I start, I might as well address the ""sleeping with underage women"" bit which has gotten some controversy in the past few years. After watching Jones' and Marion's first scene together, I definitely raised an eyebrow at the ""You knew what you were doing"" conversation, and after reading the transcript where Spielberg and Lucas intended for Marion to be 15 and for Jones to be 25 when they had their affair, that aspect of the film stuck out as problematic. Due to that (in addition to Jones being a colonist), I wasn't able to get invested in their friendship and eventual romance. If Jones' arc was of him redeeming himself throughout the film, that would be different, but he instead seemed to be portrayed as noble and charming all throughout.",

36,3 July 2021,nickenchuggets,8," ""I'm making this up as I go""","When I mention George Lucas, chances are the first thing that will come to mind is Star Wars, not Indiana Jones. Although this series was never as popular as its science fiction cousin, these movies still have that classic world war 2 atmosphere for me. Yes, I know it takes place in 1936 before the war begins, but it still involves nazis, supernatural occurrences, and an adventurer bent on stopping them armed with nothing but his wits and a bullwhip. The movie begins in the mid 1930s, and Indy is leading an expedition to south america in order to locate a mysterious and very valuable miniature golden statue. It is located in an elaborate temple that is filled to the brim with traps, tripwires, and tarantulas. After retrieving the artifact and escaping, Indy is confronted by Rene Belloq, a French rival of his who also enjoys archaeology (and humiliating Jones whenever he's able to). Jones refuses to hand over the statue to him, after which the natives and Belloq chase Indy to a river where a seaplane is waiting for him. He manages to get away for now. Later on, Jones is teaching a class at a college, and some of his colleagues tell him the nazis are trying to locate the Ark of the Covenant; an extremely powerful and sacred relic that resembles a gold-plated chest that has the 10 commandments inside of it. The Ark must be handled using long wooden poles, as it is too holy to touch. Hitler wants to find it because he believes it will make Germany unstoppable. Later, Jones travels on a plane to Nepal (and is secretly shadowed by a gestapo agent named Toht). Jones travels here because he needs to find a girl named Marion, who allegedly knows where a golden medallion that fits onto a staff is found. Toht's men set the bar Marion owns on fire, and a gunfight ensues. Indy and Marion manage to escape, but so does Toht. Luckily, she does have the medallion. Some time later, her and Indy go to Egypt, where they discover the nazis (assisted by Belloq) are trying to dig for the Ark. The germans are determined to kill Jones because they are convinced the Ark can only belong to Hitler, but Jones is one step ahead of them since he has the legitimate medallion. After going to an underground crypt, he places it on top of a staff at a specific time of day, which creates a blinding ray of light that points to the Ark's resting place. Indy does eventually find the real Ark, but is ambushed by Belloq and the germans. Belloq steals the Ark, and traps Marion and Indy inside the snake-filled crypt. They manage to find their way out, and discover the germans are attempting to fly the Ark out of north africa. Indy and a shirtless german mechanic engage in a brutal fistfight as he tries to prevent the experimental nazi flying wing from taking off. Jones manages to destroy the plane, which prompts the germans to set their plan B into action, which involves transporting the Ark using trucks. Jones manages to hijack it and brings the ark to a ship where it is to be taken to Britain. Unfortunately for them, the ship is intercepted by a german submarine, and after the nazis search the ship (and are unable to find Jones), they are convinced he is dead. Jones hitches a ride on the submarine and it brings him to some Greek island. Jones is then captured and forced to attend a ceromony with Marion where the germans open the Ark. They find nothing inside it, but soon, spirits and bolts of energy shoot out that start slaughtering the germans where they stand. After about a minute, everyone (except Indy and Marion) is dead. Back in Washington, Indiana Jones is told that ""top men"" are working on studying the Ark, but little does he know its been crated up in a warehouse and left to rot. This is a movie that is basically akin to Star Wars, in that it has an interesting story, good special effects, and memorable characters, but it is based in reality. Even though the characters are fictional, it deals with time periods and countries that once existed. For this reason, I think its clear why Indiana Jones was never as popular as Star Wars, since world war 2 related things are kind of done to death already. Still, if you like history, these movies are arguably better than Star Wars. Harrison Ford as the title character is a tough, no nonsense adventurer who will not rest until he knows the Ark is back in the hands of those who will not use it for bad purposes. He is forced to think fast and outmaneuver his enemies in order to kill them. Karen Allen plays Marion Ravenwood, Jones' companion who was in a relationship with him once, and also the only person who has the precious medallion for the staff. She is captured later on by the germans, but is still defiant as ever and trusts Indy with her life. Paul Freeman as Belloq is probably the movie's main antagonist, since he is an archaeologist like Indy but is more sinister. Despite being french, he works closely with the nazis and wants to make sure the Ark is transported to germany unharmed. Ronald Lacey plays Major Toht, the reckless, authoritarian gestapo officer whose essence is that of pure sadism. Aside from Belloq, he's probably the biggest thorn in Indy's side. After watching it, it isn't difficult to perceive why the Indiana Jones movies are so well liked, particularly this first one. Even Spielberg said he thought it was the best out of the series.",

47,19 July 2004,jazzest,3, Typical American Mainstream Cinema in the Early 80s,"This adventure flick, which mixes the Western movie formula and special effects in their infant days, represents the American mainstream cinema in the early 80s in many ways. The protagonist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a scholar and an action hero; this combination is unique but the uniqueness has nothing to do with the character development and seems to be the result of the filmmakers' thoughtless decision. The portrayal of the heroine Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) is also inconsistent; sometimes she is tough and independent, while frail and dependent on Indiana Jones in the other times. Along with a dragging optimistic story, overly stretched action scenes may be beyond the audience's attention span. The Reaganomix overshadows the plot, where the Americans can do whatever they want in foreign places (South America, Nepal, and Cairo). The sets of Nepal and Cairo look nothing but sets, while John Williams' score, with a catchy melody line by brilliant brass in the Late Romanticism taste, annoyingly accentuates every single action.",

Beyond that though, it's a shame it took me so long to give this film another look, because it's really a perfect adventure film. Not an action film (though there is action in it) but an adventure film. That's a genre we don't really see a lot anymore, and it's a real shame. There is such a spirit of fun and adventure to this whole movie that, besides the snakes, it's a real joy to watch",

A film in which you care for the characters, and see that it is better that the Ark is never found. The action scenes are very good and the CGI, although it may seem weak (after all, it was 1981), fulfills its role well (snakes still agonize me today).

Those things in and of themselves score this movie a few points, and one has to give credit for the fact that it really did set the pattern for the modern genre of action-adventure movies. It also established Harrison Ford (who was primarily known for his supporting role as Han Solo from ""Star Wars"" at the time this was made) as an action-adventure leading man (he does these parts well; I find him perhaps a bit dry when he takes on more substantive roles) although it may not establish him as an ""actor"" per se, since the part of Indiana Jones really isn't a dramatic part that would stretch or test an actor's ability.

84,12 July 2019,andrewmerritt-31652,10, The one that started it all,"Raiders of the Lost Ark stars Harrison Ford and is directed by Steven Spielberg. Raiders of the Lost Ark follows Indiana Jones as he races against the Nazis to obtain the Lost ark of the covenant. Fresh off of completing Star Wars George Lucas and Steven Spielberg came up with this idea as they were on vacation. And instead of forgetting about it the next day or creating a ""movie of the week"" that nobody would care about, they actually decided to let their imaginations run wild. Now I'm sure that before they created Raiders of the Lost Ark they saw a lot of movies involving treasure hunting and decided to give it a makeover. And from their they decided to turn something that sounds like it came out of a B movie and transformed it into an A++ movie after the project was finished. But Raiders of the Lost Ark is The Godfather of treasure hunting movies and all the treasure hunting movies are good, but they don't have that passion and majestic as Raiders of the Lost Ark offers. I should also add that it's also the inspiration for many movies and video games over the years and has been referenced in many pop cultures. You can not turn on the T.V. And having someone reference Indiana Jones or the scenes that gave birth to countless of directors and writers imitating those scenes. This movie and Star Wars were the first movies to open my eyes to many movies to come. And there are many movies out there that brilliantly fantastic, but Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars were the first to do that. Besides Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and John Williams, I don't know if the other crew who were in Star Wars also were involved in making this. I would like to think so as they borrow elements from Star Wars such as music, special effects, costumes, to just about anything you can think of and then it into something simple and easy without anything being over dramatic. I also applaud Steven Spielberg and George Lucas for having the ability to create one movie that blew people's minds and creating another movie with an iconic character for many years that people wish they could be. Because in the end who doesn't want to be Indiana Jones? So in the end every thing about this move is pure cinematic perfection that is worth exploring again and again.",
85,26 November 2021,a_chinn,10, Throwback Nazi-punching adventure tale remains a classic,"No story summary is needed for this film since everyone has seen it (if you haven't, go watch it RIGHT NOW!). I saw this in the theater as a kid and it made my mind explode. This viewing was at a pandemic drive-in showing at the fairgrounds with my kids, so it was not the most optimal of setting to watch the film. The sound was broadcast over the radio, which was terrible and we ended up not using, and listening to it over the fairground speakers was only slightly better. The picture quality was so dark you could barely make out what was happening on screen anytime a scene was remotely dark or shadowy, which is fair portion of the film. So although I was highly annoyed this poor presentation poisoned my kids' interest watching further Indiana Jones films, I do still dearly love this film. The script by Lawrence Kasdan (""Empire Strikes Back"" ""The Big Chill"" ""Body Heat"" ""Silverado"" ""The Accidental Tourist"" ""The Bodyguard"") from a story by George Lucas (""Star Wars"") and Phillip Kaufman (""The Right Stuff""), the film is pure H. Rider Haggard with an updated Allan Quatermain in the form of globe trotting archeologist adventure-seeker Indiana Jones searching for treasure, punching Nazis, and saving the world from hidden supernatural forces. As corny as all that sounds, what make ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" such a classic is the perfect casting of Harrison Ford, exhilarating direction from Steven Spielberg, and an iconic film score from John Williams. Taking first the casting of Harrison Ford, my favorite measure of a great performance is if you cannot picture any other actor in a role and Ford as Indiana Jones is about the most perfect example of this. Ford pulls off so many great moments, from his expression after the shoot-the-swordsman scene to a later moment in the film where he grudgingly accepts help from Marion (another great bit of casting with Karen Allen) and tells her where it hurts, Ford strikes a unique balance of a character who is both a superman and an everyman. Indiana Jones really is a unique hero for 80s action films, which were primarily populated by invincible Rambos, Conans, or Dirty Harrys. Simply stated, Ford IS Indiana Jones and no one else could have filled that role (but fun fact, Tom Selleck was the original first choice for the role, which wouldn't have been all that bad). As for Spielberg's direction, he captures a pitch perfect tone for the film, balancing its mix of cliffhanger serial films, but treating it like a serious action thriller, nicely updating an old style story with big budget production values, modern stunt work, and contemporary filmmaking techniques and special effects. Whether audiences appreciate throwback touches such as the Peter Lorre analogue Toth or Paul Freeman's Belloq as a stand in for a Claud Raines/James Mason type of suave charming villain, Spielberg litters the film with wonderful small nods to classic Hollywood. He's masterfully crafted a film that's equal parts nostalgic throwback and also something wholly original that had never been done before (treating pulp as serious material). And there are so many great small touches, such as making Indy a little human with an irrational fear of snakes or allowing Indy to be vulnerable allowing Marion to patch his wounds, which is also a testament to Ford's acting skills. A personal favorite little touch is having Indy wear leather gloves when he has his epic fist fight with a musclebound Nazi, which is a badass aesthetic that really needs to come back into fashion in more action flicks. Simply speaking, Spielberg knows film language down to small details in a way few filmmakers can replicate. As for John Williams score, the trumpets for ""Indy's Theme"" are just as iconic as his themes for ""Jaws,"" ""Star Wars,"" ""Superman,"" ""Harry Potter"" or innumerable other films he's indelibly left his mark. It's impossible to imaging another composer scoring an Indiana Jones film. Those are the main reasons this is such a great film, but I'd be remiss not to mention the terrific supporting cast that includes Karen Allen as Marion, Paul Freeman as Belloq, Ronald Lacey as Toht, John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, as well as Denholm Elliott and Alfred Molina in a memorable small part at the start of the film before he was famous. Overall, I will admit I have an unhealthy amount of childhood nostalgia for this film, but adolescent bias aside, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is arguably one of the greatest action films of all time.",

106,15 June 2007,OllieSuave-007,8, One of the best trilogy and character in cinema history.,"Indiana Jones is, I think, one of the best characters in cinema history. A whip-cracking adventurer, he searches for missing treasures while fighting evil. In this film, Indy is hired by the U.S. Government to find the Ark of the Covenant. It is believed that it holds the ten commandments, and he and his ex-flame Marion must also fend off Hitler agents from getting their hands on it. What results is a movie with pure adventure and entertainment; a brilliant cast, great direction, rousing music score (John Williams' Indiana Jones themes is probably one of the most recognizable and memorable in movie history) and beautiful place settings, from the villages of Egypt to the Arc of the Covenant. It's a great film, but I personally enjoyed Temple of Doom and the Last Crusade more. I just think the stories and action to those two films were more spirited and compelling. ",

109,1 December 2020,bbewnylorac,7, Good entertainment,"If you don't nitpick too much, there's lots to like about this rollicking tale of the WWII era quest by an American archaeologist cum adventurer, Indiana Jones, to find a biblical treasure, the Ark of the Covenant, before the Nazis do. It's meant to be cartoonish in style, so just drink in the beautiful settings (Tunisia, Egypt, Nepal, South America), the excellent John Williams score, and the script and direction that, at times, can be witty and inventive. Harrison Ford was born to play the role of Indiana Jones, and he's actually intelligent - well done for casting him ahead of some dumb hunk who would not have been so believable as a brainy archaeologist. Ford is excellent at playing the guy who can get himself out of any hairy situation, although most of the time, e.g. in the Amazon rainforest, it's just not believable that he would not be slaughtered immediately by that indigenous army who know that forest back to front. In addition, the indigenous men are improbably inaccurate archers in running after Ford. Karen Allen, as Ford's old girlfriend Marion, is one of the best things about the movie. The producers are ground-breaking, or maybe it's the first time since those feisty heroines of the 1940s, in depicting a lead woman as clothed, intelligent, physically strong and actually saving Indiana many times. She's fantastic. The scene of her out-drinking a local woman in Nepal is priceless. She deserved her own movie. The bad guys are the most cliched characters in this movie. They may as well have a sign on their head - ""I'm evil."" But as I said, it's meant to be a rollicking adventure, and not a serious drama that you'd criticise too heavily as not being realistic.",

The choreography and cinematography are good, but I think Spielberg does much better in later films like Jurrasic Park and Saving Private Ryan. Some of the shots and special effects haven't aged as well, though the ark scene itself is still good. The worst part for me was the dialogue. Maybe it's the genre, but it felt very quippy, like something from 1940s film noir. It didn't bring me in to the world like it did when I was kid, and that kept me from becoming fully engaged.

Much of the thrill of this beloved movie is in the fright factor, so cadavers, snakes, spiders, and nasty villains (mostly Nazis and Nazi sympathizers) also abound. Throughout the film, there is a parade of anti-Nazi symbolism and sly religious satire. Harrison Ford is the embodiment of Indiana Jones -- dry, fearless, and as indestructible as a cartoon coyote. The female lead in an Indiana Jones movie is sort of an honorary boy, no more sexual than the girls in boys' adventure magazines, although Marian can more than take care of herself and is not helpless in the face of danger.

135,3 November 2019,RhapsodyReviews,10, Classic Film.,"Review:
'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is an action-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg.
When Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) - the tweed-suited professor who just happens to be a celebrated archaeologist - is hired by the government to locate the legendary Ark of the Covenant, he finds himself up against the entire Nazi regime.
It's hard to write a review about a movie that, that has such a massive fanbase and does basically everything right. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best adventure movies I've seen. Few films have captivated me like this one did. Part of the reason it resonates so much with me is because its history and nostalgia. It's a film from the 80's about an adventure in the 30's that uncovers ancient artifacts. It's a fantastic trip through time.
The performances are just awesome all around, and Indiana Jones is surprisingly the most compelling too. You really don't get that in movies today, where the main character is the favorite. He's an archeologist, who are supposed to be dull, cautious and dweeby, but Indiana is explosive, charming and full of life. He's a grave robber that's well educated and goes on these adventures for the museum rather than the money. He's smart and passionate about what he's interested in.
It looks remarkably vintage and sharp with its characters and pristine period costumes, but it's also wild and rugged with its dusty adventures and stunning locales. The escape from the jungle tomb, the bar fight in the mountains of Nepal and the unearthing of the Ark in the desert are all iconic scenes that are thrilling and dripping with spectacle. It feels like a tomb raiding movie should, full of adventure and relentless energy in the pursuit of the Ark. By the end of the movie, you will be exhausted from the whole experience.
Overall, this movie strikes on all aspects you would want in an adventure movie. The main character feels real and is compelling, the story is very strong and exciting, and the ending leaves you wanting more.
5/5",

He isn't alone in trying to get the ark, however, because a group of Nazis are looking to obtain the ark to control God. The special effects are good for the time, however, to anyone watching this movie now would think they are cheesy and fake. The plot is very good and keeps you watching, but I feel that some of the escapes Indiana Jones makes isn't really realistic at all.

Harrison Ford is just amazing as he usually is. I also liked Karen Allen as Marion. She was just utterly great. As usual, Spielberg did a good job with his directing. The score by John Williams is catchy and memorable. The theme song is still stuck in my head. My only complaint about this film is that the film is a bit too dark.

That and the action was so ludicrous I had to wonder if all the fanatics of the series ever watched an adventure movie in their lives. Other scenes were badly played out, such as when the professors were discussion the ark, and the really lame bid with the student who had I love you written on her eye lids.     I kind of respect the series for combining an influencial hero and an adventerous plotline.

147,19 June 2017,stormhawk2021,10, A great blockbuster,"In 1975, George Lucas and Philip Kaufman came up with the concept of a film that would pay homage to the action serials of the 1930's and 40's like ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"" or ""Dick Tracy"" - you know, the one's were they'd always end in a cliffhanger? However, this idea was put on hold so that Lucas could concentrate on ""Star Wars"" in 1977. After the surprise success of that film, Lucas then embarked on the proposal and enlisted the help of Lawrence Kasdan on the screenplay and gave his friend Steven Spielberg the chance to direct and prove the studio bosses wrong after the star-studded, monumental failure of his World War II comedy ""1941"", a couple of years previously. This meeting of minds resulted in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and has since became one of cinema's most revered and iconic film's. Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a renowned archaeologist who is hired by the U.S. Government to find the Ark of the Covenant - a chest the Hebrews carried around containing the Ten Commandments. Indy is not the only one after the Ark, though, as he soon crosses paths with Hitler's Nazi's, also intent in getting their hands on the artifact. Classic Adventure film of the very highest caliber. In fact, it's hard to argue that this isn't the one to beat in terms of sheer indulgence and escapist entertainment. I grew up with Indiana Jones and there are very few characters or films who have had such a direct or major influence on my love for the cinematic art-form. It's difficult to find the words for Raiders that haven't already been said. Quite simply, it's a true action spectacle that's unparalleled and stands as one of Steven Spielberg's finest moments. He's a director that's, rightly, regarded as one of Hollywood finest filmmakers and you don't have to look much further than this film to see why. With one hair raising set-piece after another, Spielberg keeps the action relentless and fully realizes a romanticize pastiche of the aforementioned serials' clichÃ©d plot elements and devices. Of course, what aides immeasurably in bringing it all together, is a perfectly committed and physical performance from the leading man. Contrary to popular belief, Harrison Ford was the first choice for Indy. Well... it was in Spielberg's eyes, anyway. It was Lucas who wanted to cast someone else as he wanted to create a little distance from Ford having already worked with him on ""American Graffiti"" and ""Star Wars"" and as common knowledge would have it, Lucas preferred Tom Selleck. Unfortunately for him, though, he was already committed to the television series ""Magnum P.I."" which resulted in Ford securing, what would become, his signature role. I think it's fair to say that Ford has never exactly been praised for his acting range. Sure, he's certainly able to deliver some wonderful work; his powerful turn in ""The Mosquito Coast"" and his Oscar nominated performance in ""Witness"" are proof of this but his portrayal of Indiana Jones is absolutely spot on. He captures the requisite charm, wit and smarts to win you over. He exaggerates his facial expressions to the point of parody and completely sweeps the audience up in his heroic adventures. Even though he's the hero of the story, Ford never let's you think for a second that he's infallible or indestructible. Every scrape, punch or altercation still feels like it could be Indy's last and that's a fabulous achievement when you pretty much get the gist of the film's formula or structure. Considered one of the best films ever made and, to this day, remains one of the highest grossing. It went on to win four Academy Awards out of nine nominations and these accolades alone speak for themselves. I, for one, couldn't argue with any of them.",

It regards intrusion into the realms of evil and the dangers in fleeing it. Set in 1930's, archaeologist Indiana Jones is sent by the United States government to locate the Ark of the covenant before it falls under Nazi possession. He seeks out a past girlfriend who possesses a key element needed. Tremendous film filled with adventure, romance, suspense, massive chase sequences, a pit of snakes, and an opening where Jones flees from a large rock. This film contains more excitement and energy within its first ten minutes than most films of its nature. Director Steven Spielberg delivers in all its comic book glory. Harrison Ford plays Jones with wit and humour while Karen Allen plays the gutsy Marion Ravenwood. Strong supporting work by Paul Freeman as the villain Rene Belloq out to possess the Ark and ultimately pays the price for his greed. Ronald Lacey steals scenes as the sinister Major Arnold Toht who attempts interrogation on Ravenwood until ultimately reaching the same fate as Belloq. John Rhys-Davies plays a digger hired by the Nazis but he is also an old acquaintance of Jones and therefore assists him. An exciting film about history and adventure. Score: 10 / 10",

It's all a very Hollywood production and to be honest, I could have used a little more cool archaeology stuff and less of the action which seemed to go on a bit long, but this is a classic blockbuster for a reason. My understanding is one of the original inspirations was a James Bond like character, and you can certainly see that. Unfortunately that inspiration brings along some baggage, and you'll have to ignore the white hero leading frightened natives to plunder treasures and suspend disbelief over his ability to take on entire armies on his own. Overall, it's an enjoyable popcorn film though, so much so that the artistry of its brilliant ending stands out all the more.",

A bunch of people on an isolated tropical island populated by dinosaurs eventually running amok is given a radical overhaul and transformed into something more exciting and more substantial than it has any right to be; a man drives a car over a long distance across the barren states of the U.S.A., but is terrorised by a crazed truck driver becomes something quite special; a cynical parent of two young children faces the fight of his and his family's life when blood thirsty creatures invade Earth and he must guide them to some sort of safety.

And the other thing that puzzled me was that the movie was over before it had even started. I hadn’t noticed a story starting anywhere, so I was wondering how the movie could have finished. In other words, there was no film, just a blaze of action, and then suddenly the lights coming on. I heard someone comment on the way out, “I’ve never seen anything like that before.” I don’t know if she meant it in the same way as I did, but it was exactly my sentiment.

203,11 April 2006,tom-darwin,5, The First BBB Movie,"As in ""Big Budget B"" Movie, the sort of visually spectacular, splendidly orchestrated live-action cartoon that Lucas & Spielberg pioneered separately and, on this occasion, together. In 1936 heartthrob college professor & graverobbing mercenary Indiana Jones (Ford, perhaps by way of Harold Robbins & Steve McQueen) is hired by the US Army to find & loot the original Hebrew Ark of the Covenant from its presumed hiding place in a lost Egyptian city before Hitler's SS/Gestapo/Afrika Korps/Kriegsmarine/Luftwaffe/Abwehr can get it. To do this he must first procure a critical icon from a girlfriend (Allen) that he dumped and who is now running Kathmandu's answer to Rick's Cafe Americain (there's no piano, but the wind whistles most soulfully). A two-minute reverse ""Casablanca"" interlude ends with another plot twist and plenty of enjoyable, stunning mayhem. Characters come & go in no particular order, including nebbish professor Brody (Elliott), Egyptian laborer Sallah (Rhys-Davies, who could give any Tonto or Dr. Watson a run for his money), tramp sea captain Katanga (Harris), rival mercenary Belloq (Freeman, who eventually comes across as French) and cartoonishly evil Nazis (Lacey, Kahler & Higgins, all perfectly cast). Ford holds the film together with a quintessentially American mix of determination, frustration, weariness & wonder. Allen brings a coarse feminism to the role of damsel tied to a set of railroad tracks. The film fails because its convoluted plot can never find even the tiniest ground in common sense, much less reality, with plot holes large enough for whole solar systems to nest comfortably. The largest of many large, of course, is that the hero's job is to rob other peoples of their cultural treasures and sell them for money. In a scene that desperately needed to be cut, Belloq actually points this out to Jones. Other giant leaps include Hitler's obsession with the occult (nonexistent), Germany's dominance in Egypt and the Mediterranean (never happened) and enough Biblical heresies to make Harry Potter look like the Pope. The charm of ""Lost Horizons"" (Jones flies over the same mountains at about the same time, but Shangri-La prefers Ronald Colman) and even ""King Solomon's Mines"" is replaced here by breathtaking action punctuated by Groucho-esq one-liners (""I'm making this up as I go along"") and the obligatory juvenile, Spielberg gross-out scenes (Tarantino slices off body parts, Spielberg likes snakes, bugs & sharks). Still, Lucas & Spielberg are the masters of effective excess and ""Raiders"" is best enjoyed as a series of cartoon or ""Lone Ranger"" or ""Perils of Pauline"" adventures (the opening sequence is supposedly inspired by a Disney Ducks cartoon, anyway). Williams's music is as wonderful as any he's done and perhaps the best ever in an action film.

He is sent down to look for the Ark of the Covenant. His arch rival Belloq is going after it too. With the help of Marion(Karen Allen) and Sallah(John Rys-Davies), I think that's how you spell both names, he will find the Ark of the Covenant. Little does Belloq know what the ark is capable of. He may have to read the bible to figure that one out. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the greatest of the Jones films. I don't even have to explain why.

Harrison Ford gives his best performance since the original Star Wars movie (along with Karen Allen.). This is one of the best movies ever as well as being the best movie of 1981.",
209,14 July 2009,film-critic,8, Do you think Illinois Nazis wanted the Ark as well?,"As a child of the 80s, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was the epitome of movie making. Two big directors, a huge star, Nazis, the unknown, a spooky finale, action, adventure, humor, far away lands – this movie, this one singular film had it all. This film had something for everyone; man, woman, and child could all sit around and be amazed by Indy's adventure. Everything about this film is addicting. Watching it then, and even today – Indiana Jones' theme music stuck with me for hours afterwards. This film is more than just a casual view; it is a part of history in the making. The cult icon that Spielberg and Lucas created breathed a celebrity life into the world of archaeology, but also has handed the world a character that felt real and exciting. With that said, re-watching this staple of my youth today, in 2009, it became a far different cinematic experience. ""Raiders"" is an important film, it is still an amazing film to watch, it is still two hours of entertaining adventure, but does the DVD do it justice? Is ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" only really meant to be enjoyed on VHS? These questions arise from crisper images shouting through my player at night, the lack of detail around the edges (don't be ashamed of the VHS fuzz), and how bright this dusty hero should have looked. I am not judging quality here, but Indy will always remain a VHS protagonist in my book.",

211,24 March 2002,jhaggardjr,10, This is what excitement is all about!,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is what excitement is all about. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film is a great adventure tale made in the tradition of those old Saturday matinee serials. Harrison Ford put on the fedora for the first of three appearances as Indiana Jones, the archaeologist who has taken us on three great adventures. Here, Dr. Jones goes after the mystical Ark of the Covenant. The action scenes and special effects are spectacular. The film plays like a rollercoaster ride and there's plenty of on-the-edge-of-your-seat excitement. Karen Allen, who plays Dr. Jones' love interest Marion, is a great heroine (easily the best of the series). The villains include a French archaelogist (Paul Freeman), who's kind of Dr. Jones' counterpart; and some really nasty Nazis. This movie is as good as it gets. Great direction by Spielberg, who collaborated with ""Star Wars"" creator (and good friend) George Lucas to create a brilliant movie series. The second movie ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" followed in 1984, and that was followed by the third movie ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" in 1989. All three movies are excellent, but ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is the best. ",

Characters like Sallah had no introduction. None of the characters had an ""arc"", which is fine by me as I don't think it's a necessity, but they had no depth, which is hard to get past.

Ford fully encapsulates the idea of the action hero without descending into either the muscle bound strongman or the camp geek traps. Raiders of the Lost Ark plays like an adventure serial condensed into a single narrative, combining elements of Western action with an archaeological edge that would make games like Tomb Raider and Uncharted popular in the 90s and 00s.

The action is definitely the best aspect - the stunts are obviously iconic, but the direction of the action is so smooth, and it makes it very easy to follow and as a result more enjoyable. Too many action movies nowadays rely on shaky cam, and whilst shaky cam can be used effectively (see Saving Private Ryan) I ultimately do prefer smoothly shot action as done here. Of course we have the brilliant Harrison Ford as Indy, but I also really like Marion in this film. She has an actual character here, which is so much better than Kate Capshaw's character in Temple of Doom who just screams constantly. The villains aren't well developed as such, but they're not meant to be - they're just meant to be intimidating, and they do that really well. The story is simple, yet also really effective. It's a plain macguffin story, but it allows for the action to drive the story, and that stops the film from being too bogged down by exposition. The score is one of the best of all time - John Williams really is a master composer - and the film is just really entertaining. Overall, it's a fantastic film.",

Why Did It Have to be Snakes?,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is one of the many cinematic Spielberg masterpieces in the modern age of movie making. This movie is beyond expectations, beyond thrilling, and it's beyond amazing. Harrison Ford brings the performance of a lifetime as Indiana Jones, an archaeologist with a taste of adventure, thrills, and love. That's probably the whole plot of the entire series. Director Steven Spielberg brings another incredible movie to the world since ""Jaws"", and teams up with George Lucas, the mastermind behind the incredible ""Star Wars"" franchise, to bring yet another screen hero. So, this movie brought the incredible works of Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford, to bring a movie that will span from generation to generation. One of my favorite movies of all time, with everything you would expect in a movie. The incredible visual effects blew me away, and it turned to be an amazing accomplishment. The cinematography is gorgeous, the editing is crystal, the characters are priceless, the story is superb, the sound is exceptional, the action is incredible, and my two favorite moments in the film were the beginning sequence involving a giant death ball, and a death-defying pit filled with snakes. But my all-time favorite thing about this movie, is John Williams' incredible music, including the classic Raiders March.

Nor is the female character necessarily a run of the mill damsel in distress, although the second half of the movie submits her to that cliche. It's the plot, side characters, action scenes, casual humor, and grisly effects - despite its 1980s PG rating, which would easily be an R today - that really stick with you.

Winning 4 oscars out of the 9 nominations it had, just tells you what a great movie this truly is. Packed with action, adventure, comedy , with a little of bit of romance on the side, it ticks off all the good things you would love to see in a movie and that includes a great leading man, no other than Harrison Ford.
Absolutely loved the opening scene. Spiders creeping, big rocks rolling after you, booby traps and seeing a beautiful sunset.
I love the idea of a teacher who actually does, because they always say those who can't do, teach but it doesn't apply here on Indie. He is the hot, handsome professor archeologist with a whip and the coolest hat ever.
There was a chase scene that I thought took too long, it got boring. The Nepal Scene was very intense and may make give you the shivers with an incident you don't want happening to you. The Funniest scene has to be the sword and the gun.
John Ryhs Davies was amazing as always with that great accent of his. Karen Allen is my least favorite in the movie, but I can see that she does give a lot of character around Indiana jones.
Steven Spielberg for me is one of the best directors of all time, you can always tell if it's a Spielberg movie, his direction is outstanding, eye catching and in a class of its own. The elements of adventure and comedy are always strong and it's evident here in The Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indian Jones is an iconic movies from the eighties is a must watch.

Harrison Ford (originally meant to be Tom Selleck) stars as Indiana Jones, a hero with a felt hat and a whip. The film begins with a great scene where Indy tries to get an ancient gold statue. Then obviously the main story comes, some U.S. government have heard that the German Nazis (oh, this is 1936, during World War II) are searching for religious artefacts in Cairo, more prominently the Lost Ark (the Ark of the Covenant, the chest that carried the Ten Commandments). It is Indy's job to stop them from getting this Ark, otherwise they could unleash an unnatural force that can probably wipe out anything and everything. Indy is accompanied by his past girlfriend Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) who has something to get him started with his search. He doesn't know it yet, but the man mainly responsible for helping out and leading this dig, along with French Major Arnold Toht (Ronald Lacey), is his old enemy (the one who nicked his gold statue), Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman). What follows is obviously lots of gun play, a lot of German Nazis, some explosions and a little bit of fantasy. Also starring John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, BAFTA nominated Denholm Elliott as Dr. Marcus Brody, Alfred Molina as Satipo and Wolf Kahler as Colonel Dietrich. This is a fantastic start to the great trilogy, the third film is still my favourite, but you must see the one that started it all. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Music for John Williams, a Special Achievement Award and Best Picture, and it won the BAFTA for Best Production Design/Art Direction, and it was nominated the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Film.

The direction by Spielberg is as good as you'd expect, with some particularly incredible stunt choreography. This is probably one of the cleanest looking films of the eighties, drenched in vivid colour and containing some dazzling special effects. And of course the John Williams score is iconic and perfectly fitted to the film. But it's Harrison Ford's performance that steals the show and is arguably the main reason for the popularity of the Indiana Jones series. He looks perfect for this role and delivers just the right balance of dryness and bravado, working well with a fairly unimpressive support cast.",

It's basically a throwback to the 1920s and 1930s adventure serials that told the sagas of service members battling German soldiers around the world. And that's what you get here. Harrison Ford was great for the role, and now that I'm older I like this film role of his better than Han Solo and all the others. I also like Indiana Jones better than I like James Bond. The women aren't too cliched as damsels in distress and Karen Allen does justice in this film as the streetwise love interest of the main hero. And those locations; what a way to go! From South America to an island in the Mediterranean. After watching my dad's VHS tapes, I became a fan. This is my second-favorite Indy film (after Last Crusade).",

It was extremely fun and enjoyable to watch and it can be watched repeatedly, with no lesser joy. Harrison Ford as Indy is extremely charismatic, like Han Solo, but the character of Indiana for me has an essence that creates a more likable character (modesty, I think) and by doing that, it creates a better trilogy for me, indeed surpassing the Original Star Wars Tilogy (don't get me wrong I love Star Wars as well).",

I know so much has been said.  My two cents' worth is.  A great character, one with incredible determination but human failings, a wonderful female sidekick with whom he has a history. A series of magnificent ""hopeless"" situations.  Nazis.  A mystical object from the Bible.  Pacing that is exquisite.  One narrow scrape after another. Broken ribs.  Carrying on with broken ribs.  Just enough of the supernatural to make for a good conclusion (although, how do the heroes know that you're not supposed to look at things), though the majority of the film is about real people in the most insane maze of events.  I saw this in the theater the second day it was out.  It hadn't had the hoopla that the Star Wars movies had had.  I came out of it feeling so excited that someone in the movie industry could spin such a tail and conclude it in the most satisfying way.

Clearly George Lucas and Spielberg's love affair with the old serials and old comic books paid off big. This movie is a homage to a age we will never see again the real golden age of movie making. Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones forget the casting of Tom Selleck Selleck could not have pulled it off as well as Ford. Spielberg remarked that they needed a actor of the level of Bogart who both said would've been perfect for the role of Indy. I could see Bogart playing Indiana Jones and Grace Kelly or Lauren Bacall playing Marion Ravenwood while Errol Flynn could've chewed the scenery as Belloq or maybe Rathbone being Belloq. This movie is timeless and any cast from the golden age of Hollywood would've done justice to it. This movie needs to be in every serious movie lover's collection.,

It blends action and adventure with comedy, drama, romance, and horror seamlessly. The hero, Indiana Jones, is a man's man.

When Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) - the tweed-suited professor who just happens to be a celebrated archaeologist - is hired by the government to locate the legendary Ark of the Covenant, he finds himself up against the entire Nazi regime. It's hard to write a review about a movie that, that has such a massive fanbase and does basically everything right. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best adventure movies I've seen. Few films have captivated me like this one did. Part of the reason it resonates so much with me is because its history and nostalgia. It's a film from the 80's about an adventure in the 30's that uncovers ancient artifacts. It's a fantastic trip through time. The performances are just awesome all around, and Indiana Jones is surprisingly the most compelling too. You really don't get that in movies today, where the main character is the favorite. He's an archeologist, who are supposed to be dull, cautious and dweeby, but Indiana is explosive, charming and full of life. He's a grave robber that's well educated and goes on these adventures for the museum rather than the money. He's smart and passionate about what he's interested in. It looks remarkably vintage and sharp with its characters and pristine period costumes, but it's also wild and rugged with its dusty adventures and stunning locales. The escape from the jungle tomb, the bar fight in the mountains of Nepal and the unearthing of the Ark in the desert are all iconic scenes that are thrilling and dripping with spectacle. It feels like a tomb raiding movie should, full of adventure and relentless energy in the pursuit of the Ark. By the end of the movie, you will be exhausted from the whole experience. Overall, this movie strikes on all aspects you would want in an adventure movie. The main character feels real and is compelling, the story is very strong and exciting, and the ending leaves you wanting more.",

""E.T."", ""Close Encounters"", the whole ""Star Wars"" thing, hate them all. But this is different. I do love a swashbuckling adventure movie and here Spielberg gives us the ultimate old- fashioned actioner. Spielberg has described his Indiana Jones as his take on James Bond, only with less intrigue and less sex but with more excitement and levity. Like Bond Indy has his own signature theme tune, gets a spine tingling big-budget opening prologue, can fight like the blazes and of course, gets the girl. Setting the movie during the Second World War provides easily identifiable baddies in the form of the pursuing Nazis and also means it has much less reliance on modern gimmicks and gadgets. If anything though the set-piece action sequences are better here than anything surely done to date even whilst some of the stunts recall Golden Age Hollywood, for example Indy's crawl under a speeding truck is only a variation of the same under an out of control wagon in many a Western of yore.",

Lawence Kasdan's script based on George Lucas's story is a masterclass in lean, affectionately crafted action cinema with any extraneous scenes torn out. Thus its effectively a series of finally crafted set pieces laced together with the odd expositionary moment where necessary, moving toward its exceptional climax, possibly one of the best of all time, with boundless enthusiasm, pace and wit. There is a line of argument, particularly amongst European Critics, that the success of Raiders...cemented a trend in American Cinema that had begun with Jaws and then Star Wars for the kind of thrill seeking feature that has lead to the degradation of so much big-budget output throughout the following 20 years.

The main protagonist Indiana Jones is played by Harrison Ford, I will just say that Ford is Indiana Jones. They first tried to cast Tom Selleck for this role but I am very glad that Harrison Ford played Indy instead. This is a film that inspired many filmmakers and video game creators by trying to recreate adventurous protagonists that goes on explorations. This film doesn't just have a iconic protagonist but many iconic scenes that is actually very memorable. Many kids tried to copy Indy and wanted to be Indy, because he is such a cool, charismatic, heroic and adventurous badass who is irresistible to women. He is more of a likable hero than James Bond and isn't a misogynist. Instead Indy is a true archaeologist at heart that loves history and does his best to preserve priceless artifacts for the future instead of personal gain. In another words, he is a role model that kids could look up to. So I couldn't help but root for the guy through his ordeals. The cinematography and set pieces is immersive and really does have the energy and pacing that will absorb audiences into the whole experience. It was even nominated for academy awards and actually won few of them. I will say again the set pieces really does elevate the action sequences. And the action is a blast to sit through and even adds the right amount of humor during certain parts. Films like this shows that the story doesn't have to be overly complex and has a lot of depth to it to make it classic. This is a solid entertainment blockbuster that excels in almost every area.",

This movie firstly has the iconic Stephen Spielberg in the directors chair and the beloved George Lucas as a writer. It has a iconic soundtrack that is like 2001 A Space Odyssey with the amount of importance it plays to cinema history. Overall it's a perfect Action Adventure through and through. The story is paced perfectly by giving you scenes where you learn about the plot, but it also has a healthy amount of action. Harrison Ford and Karen Allen are perfect Main characters with thier charisma and charm. There is really nothing else to say about it honestly!",

Marion, of all the women Jones met, still holds up, forget that annoying Willie Scott or the greedy Elsa, Marion has it all, feistyness, beauty, and cleverness.

I don't think they did. I'm told by my film making student brother that Spielberg and George Lucas made this with a certain amount of 'camp' in mind to pay homage to the action serials of the 1930's and 1940's which they pull off brilliantly. The budget on Raiders of The Lost Ark was eighteen million dollars, which was no paltry sum almost 30 years ago but it was far from being a big budget picture which went on to gross over 200 million dollars domestically. As brilliant as the film is for adventure I owe the success to ONE man and that IS Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford but more on that in a moment. I don't believe they knew they were making adventure genre history when they made this. First of all it wasn't Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark...he wasn't the focal point of the film. It was about the snakes and boulders and exotic locations, and wise cracks, and romance and just everything about it oozes 1940 classic cinema and people loved it. It is very unique and as a kid it blew me away and kept me riveted. I ALWAYS wanted to be Indiana Jones...ALWAYS. Watching it again years later I admit it didn't quite capture me in the same way but you can't dispute it's brilliance and effect on cinematic history.",

The film begins strongly with a thrilling sequence in which Indy has to make his way through booby traps galore in a tomb, and while nothing later on quite matches this tension, there are several exciting moments to be had with a multi-tonal John Williams score perfectly complementing the action. This is hardly a deep or meaningful film, the antagonists range from one-note to one-dimensional and as a character, Indy lacks the charisma of an action hero like James Bond. The attempts to paint Indy as an ordinary university professor who just enjoys adventures never quite gels either since he is more agile and better at close combat than the very best of MI6. All that said and done, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a film full of memorable small moments and there are several excellent artistic shots throughout, most notably some diggers against an orange sunset and Harrison Ford viewed as only a shadow against a wall when first meeting Karen Allen. A supernatural twist near the end also takes the film in some unexpected directions and the iconic final shot of the film makes for a fantastic final note to end on.",

Worth seeing again today and funny like hell, except if you are afraid of snakes or spiders. Steven Spielberg and his friend George Lucas are obsessed by Hitler and the Nazis. They situate the film in 1936, In Egypt where the Germans are looking for the Lost Ark of the Temple of Jerusalem. Indiana Jones is not only an adventurer, sorry a university professor turned adventurer during his vacation, but he is also the good guy who is fulfilling a quasi-divine mission, that of saving a Jewish mythical artifact from the hands of the Nazis because it is too valuable to let it rot in bad hands, but also because it is said it may give eternal life to the person who would control it. With that in mind and with a little bit of romanticism and sentimentalism he is able to complete the mission, to destroy a few German Nazis along with it and to sow the seed that will produce the Junior who will take over four films later to assume the continuation of the myth in the 21st century. Of course what is essential and unique in this film is the action, a perfectly gratuitous action that is shown only for our pleasure and in no way for our reflection or moral improvement. And it works perfectly well along that line. Still quite enjoyable today nearly thirty years later. A student recently pretended that good special effects were not common in that period and before. This film proves he is wrong. Special effects were maybe less technical, certainly less computerized than today, but they were just as creative and inventive as today, with a lot less technical means, hence with a lot more sweat and grey matter.",

It was at that point that the movie began to self-destruct. It went from being a fast-paced action film to an uneven love story cum religious tract. Granted, a good many of the serials that RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK borrows from (sometimes, shot for shot) aren't as accomplished overall- but, back in the day, those 12 to 15 chapter serials were done for a lot less than the cost of the titles for a Big Budget effort like this. There ARE a good many sequences throughout the movie, but there are also a good many less-than-impressive sequences and lapses in logic and unexplained plot points that remain (one of my pet peeves has always been the idea that Jones somehow managed to ride a submerged Nazi submarine halfway around the world, a point that was taken up in an episode of THE BIG BANG THEORY, but I've never seen the missing scene that allegedly explains the discrepancy).",

Spielberg teams up with George Lucas after his success with ""Star Wars"" as both of the greatest filmmakers had set out to pay homage to the old serials of the 1930s. The movie is about an archaeologist and professor name, Indiana Jones as he goes on an adventure to search for the Ark of the Covenant with the help of the love of his life Marion Ravenwood. However, Indy's rival Rene Belloq has been working with the Nazis as they both go after the Ark, and it is up to Indy to retrieve the Ark before its too late. It has been 35 years, since this movie came out back in 1981 and it still is my favorite of the series. The series itself may have pay respect to the ""James Bond"" movies, but they also pay tributes to the old serials of the 1930s until the fourth one pays tribute of the 1950s sci-fi B movies. With that said, whenever I watch this movie, it never feels dated nor is it cheesy. Like the ""Star Wars"" series, you will always feel the experience as you go on for the ride as the ""Indiana Jones"" series explore exotic locations and search for artifacts. By getting to the point, Harrison Ford is definitely Indiana Jones as he is as Han Solo. He does a brilliant job with the role as his character is someone that you don't want to mess with because he is rough, cool and is always amazed when he is discovering artifacts. Of course, he is always into as I quote from the second movie ""Fortune and Glory."" Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood is my favorite of all the girls that Indy has met in his life. Not only is she beautiful, but she can be also feisty too. Sometimes she be a damsel in distress, but she never whines and complain like Willie Scott did in the second movie. Her character is pretty complex as you learn about her as she and Indy did had some history together as she had romantic affair with him. Paul Freeman as Belloq is a really good villain, and quite a rivalry to Indy as they are always after the same artifact as they're trying to retrieve. The rest of the cast all did well. Steven Spielberg does an amazing job on directing the movie with George Lucas coming up with this brilliant concept that he had created. Lawrence Kasdan has wrote a brilliant script, and the story itself always kept me investing as well as the characters. The special effects by Industrial Light & Magic are absolutely fantastic for its used of practical effects, matte paintings and miniature work. John Williams' music is completely unforgettable, and there is no denying that the theme he created would be as iconic as the ""Star Wars"" theme. The action scenes are very well done as well as the physical work that were put on camera. The cinematography by Douglas Slocombe is also wonderful as I do get a sense of the 1930s, which it does put me in the right atmosphere. The humor is done well, for example, Indy has an Arab Swordsman in his way as you think there is going to be fight between them, instead Indy just shoots him because he has no time for that. The movie is also very well putted together, and it does go by at a very good pace. I never see any flaws with this movie, because this movie is definitely flawless, and it will always be either one of the greatest or the greatest adventure films of all time. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a classic adventure film, and I am giving it a 10 out of 10.",

Indy is such a fascinating, larger-than-life personality that he outright demands our attention when he's on the screen (which is something like 95% of the time) and, even when we think we've got him figured out, still manages to surprise us. Casting Harrison Ford was absolutely crucial, though, because without his off-the-chart levels of confidence and charisma, the character wouldn't have been able to get away with half the things he does or says. Although it trots the globe, seemingly without rest, the plot is actually very well-paced and wisely gives the cold shoulder to any hint of overwrought back-story or origin. We're having enough fun in the present, so why get caught up in anything more complicated than ""He's a professor who moonlights as a tomb raider""? Quick-witted and funny when appropriate, exciting and unpredictable the rest of the time, it manages a near-perfect blend of realism and fantasy.

Bristling with imaginative escapades, exhilarating action sequences, clever plot twists and enthusiastic performances, this is perhaps the most complete and enjoyable of Spielberg's early films. Some might argue that Jaws or Close Encounters Of The Third Kind are just as good  perhaps even better  but for me this is the finest of all his films prior to Schindler's List. What also helps Raiders Of The Lost Ark immeasurably is the refreshingly tough and resourceful female character played by Karen Allen.

It was a great blockbuster and everybody talked about the new Indiana Jones. This one is no doubt on of the best of the series. I mean especially the chase scenes in Egypt were well executed with charm and humor. Therefore some dialog sequences were unnecessary too long and stopped the dynamic pace. The story with the Nazi and the chase of the treasure was well mixed. Some special effects looked cartooning but didn't disturb at all. The technology was not on nowadays standard. Harrison Ford gave an original character to Indy Jones. Ford's performance will never be replaced by another actor.

397,23 June 2011,MovieGeekBlog,10, A perfect film,"Call me childish, call me narrow-minded, call me a ""blockbuster-junkie"", call whatever-you- want, but to me this is the perfect films! Such a bold statement might require some explanation (which hopefully I will be able to give in this post) and certainly begs the question: what makes a film perfect? I believe a perfect film is one that can be watched over and over again: a film that you never grow tired of and that whenever is on TV and you stumble across it, you end up watching. A perfect film is one of those where you struggle to pick up one favourite scene, because they're all so good. A perfect film is one of those you really wouldn't change anything about it and where all its elements (story, direction, acting, music, cinematography, editing and so on) come together in a such a way that it's virtually impossible to choose one over the other. Raiders is 30 years, but still shines as if it were made yesterday except that it wasn't because, as we all know ""they don't make them like this anymore"". I still remember going to the movie theatre when it first got released (Yes, I'm giving away my age: clearly I'm not a teenager!) and being absolutely blown away by it. At the time there was nothing like it (and arguably, that's probably still true today). Ever since then people have been trying to imitate its winning formula, and, needless to say, most of them failed miserably. Just to give you an idea of what I am talking about (and to prove my point), just think of Lara Croft, Prince of Persia, National treasure, The Mummy Trilogy and even those films inspired by the Dan Brown's books: well, those are the most successful ones Enough said. I won't even go into the list of endless B-movies. Right from the word ""go"", from when the summit of the Paramount logo dissolves into a Peruvian mountain (a Visual device which will become the trademark of the entire series), you know you're in for something which is not only original but clever and handsomely made. What follows that logo is probably one of the best first sequences of any action movies ever made. The mysterious forest, the haunting music, the bloody statue, the group of explorers, the old map, the hidden cave, the pulsating tension, the crawling spiders, the giant web, the deadly traps, the decomposed body, the big scares, the golden idol, the sliding door, the traitor, the whip, the rolling boulder, the French baddie, the wild Hovitos, the arrows, the chase across the fields, the swinging vine, John Williams's ""raiders theme"", the snake on the plane, the jokes breaking the tension: and all this is just within the first 10 minutes!!! It is such an incredible edge-of-your-seat beginning that after that the film can afford to launch into a very long scene with some massive exposition And I haven't even mentioned the hero himself, Indiana Jones. Harrison Ford deserves a lot of credits for the success of this film. Who knows what would have happened if Tom Selleck had played the role: he was the first choice, after all (I will be eternally grateful to Magnum PI). Harrison Ford manages to make Indiana Jones strong and frail at the same time, funny and sad, invincible and weak. Indy is a hero but he gets hurt, tired, dirty and sweaty. It doesn't matter how far-fetched and over-the-top the action might be, Ford makes it feel real. Spielberg directs it all with clockwork perfection but he's also able to improvise on the spot and use it all to his advantage (most famously, the now-classic scene where Indy shoots the sword-man, which as we all know by now, was pretty much improvised on the spot). He orchestrates it all with a mastery that's never showy and always serving the story and the action as he uses all the tricks in the film-maker book: long lens shots during a chase sequence, a tracking shot across the desert to show the scale of the landscape, a single one- take shot during a drinking competition.",

But there is hardly a single moment in this movie that is not adrenaline-stimulating in its excitement. Spielberg willingly throws logic out the window in favor of creating something that is just old-fashioned, nonstop nostalgic entertaining fun and he does it very well and with that pure craftsmanship that has made him one of the really good directors of contemporary times.

Temple of Doom started off good but of fell apart after that. This is not true in Raiders of the lost ark, it maintains a classic action quality throughout. The Last Crusade is about almost was as good as the original, so if you like Indiana 1, you should watch the Last Crusade. These two are definitely worth watching.

There would be a few obligatory scenes where an ancient people with spears would be chasing after the hero. Alan Quartermain was one of the first of these adventure-heroes traveling to distant lands seeking adventure. A few of these adventure-genre stories were produced into films, such as ""King Kong"", ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (by the same producers as ""King King""), ""Four Frightened People"", and ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"". Even the ""Flash Gordon"" serials had much in common with these adventure-to-other-lands series.

Its just wilfully stupid all the way through, the ""plot"" was thought out in the length of the average bowel movement and makes absolutely no sense. Nazis are digging for an artefact, Indiana has to stop them finding it. In reality they were looking in the wrong place and he actually found it for them. But then he manages to steal it back. Then they manage to steal it back and it kills them all anyway, and somehow he is the celebated hero who somehow accomplished something? Take him out of the equation and either the Nazis would have never found the artefact or they would have found it and all died exactly as happened. Wtf who thinks that is a plot?! Every scene was absurd and not thought through. Ridiculous coincidences outside of the usual allowed formulaic action move tropes, like 1000s of people at the dig site and no one keeping watch at night, not one person is awake? Was that a submarine or wasn't it? If it was why didn't it go underwater while he was riding on the top on a long journey? And why was no one up there with him? And the ark melts everyone who looks at it but because he kept his eyes closed he was safe, but the rope binding them conveniently burnt off anyway? Also, this one is inconsequential but annoying, she beat the guy at the drinking game because he passed out on his last drink, but he was just a turn ahead and she never finished that round either so why did she win?

418,20 November 2014,Riddler2,10, Indiana Jones the greatest adventure hero of all time take that Mr Bond!,Raiders of the Lost Ark the greatest adventure movie of all time nothing tops it nothing! Harrison Ford stars as the bull whip loving archaeologist and Karen Allen is his longtime girlfriend Marion Ravenwood!. They are the greatest on screen couple in the history of film! The story is simple but fun and really entertaining once the adventure gets going but you need the backstory first before the adventure can begin and it is a supernatural force not something to be taken lightly but it is a force of supernatural power that can control everything in your grasp! The direction of this heart stopping movie is phenomenal and something as I said earlier will never be bettered! The Master of film really needed a miracle after the failure of 1941 and boy did he make a adventure classic he really did! I want to talk about John Williams's Theme which is so iconic you can hum it straight away I mean I know every part of the theme every single section of the music I can follow the film along and notice every thrilling trumpet solo and every beat and action the music provides just every section of that unforgettable theme is memorable even the love theme of Marion and Indy's relationship is so perfect! There are some special scenes that are perfect for studying film and it's needs to entertain the fist fight the truck chase are perfect examples of this! John's music scores both of those scenes and all the action scenes the basket game and the Arab swordsman who Indy shoots in the film's best moment of comedy are all scored beautifully and perfectly! Every time the theme is played you know Indy is doing something heroic or heart stopping because you associate the theme with Indy and the adventure and every time the music does not play it means Indy is not on the screen it could be Marion or the Germans that is so important to the film and impossible to replicate in an action film!

It falls into the same category as George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" trilogy: fun, but not really intelligent. It's bizarre how people can confuse the two. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" has a very intriguing, though slight, plot and it is fun to see Indiana Jones search for the Ark of the Covenant while fending off the bad guys in some great action scenes. But the slight plot starts to wear very thin after the ark is discovered, and the movie dives into a constant battle of Indiana getting possession of the ark and Belloq taking it away, and it becomes very tedious. After the ark is discovered, the movie becomes plagued with filler scenes, beginning with the scene in which Indiana and Marion try to steal the plane, and continuing with the truck chase and the boat ride until the gruesome end, which is very lazily written. Sure, there are some fun moments, and those less interested in plot development will get a kick out of it, but a masterpiece, or even a very good movie, it isn't.",

It's less spiritual than 'Last Crusade', and Indiana is not as personified as a man with a lot of story. (His father in 'Last Crusade' brings out the background story and another side to Indiana than we see in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.')

And what an adventure they wrote for him to have! The lovely Karen Allen comes along for the ride and gets caught up in the adventure, too. There were three Indiana Jones films made and this one is the best of the lot. It's probably the most believable story, and the pace is, as I said, very fast. The basic story is that the Ark of the Covenant, containing the 10 Commandments, is in danger of being found by the Nazis. Indiana Jones goes on a journey to snatch this prize out from under the collective German noses. There is suspense, just a hint of humor and more action than a 10-ring circus.

Director Steven Spieldberg, Screenplay/Story George Lucas 1980-1981 saw various thrilling fantasy/adventure films, including The Empire Strikes Back, Excalibur, Clash Of The Titans and this Spieldberg/Lucas collaboration ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"". What more can be said about this classic of American adventure cinema ? In the simplest terms, this type of movie appealed to the archetypal heroes and villains we have grown up with in comic books, Westerns, space operas, and according to Joseph Campbell, humanity' earliest myths and campfire stories. It made audiences excited about the movies again, rooting for the hero again, booing the incredibly evil villain again who no doubt will get his comeuppance, and this film has a huge following. There is even a new Indiana Jones movie in the works. This is the first of the Indian Jones Trilogy (Temple of Doom and Last Crusade) which continued through the 80's. Harrison Ford will always be remembered for the role of Professor and Archaeologist Indiana Jones, a swashbuckling type, complete with brains, brawns, sleuth skills and a whip. His only weakness ? He's deathly afraid of snakes! It's the 1930's. Indiana's father, another famed archaeologist, has searched for the Biblical Ark of the Covenant all his life. The German Nazis are also actively searching for it. Indiana is sent on a mission to stop the Nazis and find the Ark of the Covenant so that it could be protected by America. He meets up with the beautiful and strong Marion Ravenswood (Karen Allen) and with the highly intelligent and exotic Salla (John Rhys-Davies) and embark on a dangerous quest to find this elusive holy relic which is rumored to have cosmic powers. There is never a dull moment in this film. Shot on location in North Africa, Egypt and South America, this film manages to keep us at the edge of our seats as we see the struggle between Jones and the Nazis, finally coming to a climatic finale in which the Ark is opened. The special effects are rather tame now, but even so, they produce a powerful spell that works well for this movie. It's a classic. With music by John Williams, stunning cinematography and fine acting, this film is sure to keep anyone young at heart and thirsting for today's movies to be more like this.",

447,31 August 2012,Bruce722,6, Overrated.,"This movie was just about what I expected in some ways but unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype in others. First with the good stuff, it was exactly what I thought in terms of actions sequences, whip cracks, and archaeological hunts. Those things were the strong elements of the film in my opinion. There were also plenty of funny scenes and the effects, while terrible in today's standards, were pretty darn good for a 30+ year-old film. The reason this movie rated so low, however, is for the few negative parts. Things like the fact that the Indiana Jones character might be the dumbest protagonist in action film history for example. Or the corny scenes that mar so many films of that era. I honestly don't know what people were thinking back then to enjoy such tomfoolery. The other things that hurt the film weren't as major. The mystical/supernatural element was unfortunate but that's more of a personal thing. I tend to zone out when ridiculous stuff comes on the screen in supposedly realistic settings. The acting also wasn't great but it wasn't all that bad either. I was disappointing though in the lack of charisma from Harrison Ford during the movie. The same guy who managed to turn a douche bag smuggler in the Star Wars saga into a fan favorite didn't have much opportunity to do the same here. I mainly blame the writing and directing.

They are both after the same thing and it's a rat race to see what is in store for Indy and CO.. Near the ending it is spectacular, and to some views might be a little tense, but it's not that bad. I loved the last of the movie the warehouse scene, it seemed like the perfect ending to an excellent movie. I would recommend this movie to any1, especially to Harrison Ford fans you won't be disappointed. Kris L. CocKayne",

481,7 February 2015,TheManwithNoName_,10, I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of!,"There is no doubt in my mind that Indiana Jones is the best movie francaise in the history of cinema. This is my all time favorite film. This is simply the best action film ever made. That will stand the test of time forever. I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times, with no lesser joy. This film has it all: action, romance, comedy, and suspense. From the start to the end you are hooked to this movie. I just love every bit of it. Harrison Ford is one of my all time favorite actor, he brings THE greatest and most charismatic character on the silver screen in this Steven Spielberg and George Lucas collaboration. Indiana Jones is the likable, stubborn, intelligent, and determinedan archaeologist adventurer with his trademark hat, whip, leather jacket, and pistol he spends his time traveling all over the world through jungles, deserts, oceans, and caverns in search for hidden treasures. He escapes countless dangers, including fighting thugs in a busy Cairo bazaar, and hangs underneath a fast-moving truck in an exciting chase through a dusty road, just to name a few. You can't forget John William's classic score which is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows. Steven Spielberg wanted to bring back the classic B-film adventure movies. Instead, he created one of the most revolting and loved films of all time. All three Indiana Jones stories were entertaining but this first one is still the best. I would think most people would agree with me on that. They would also agree this film has some very memorable scenes, - like the opening one with the gigantic boulder chasing Indy - to the ending scene with the Ark of the Convenant opened - that will be Hollywood classics for years to come. This will always be considered the greatest adventure film of all time.",

This film began the whole modern era of adventure films. This was the great pairing of the minds of Spielberg and Lucas, and it worked. There is greatness in so much of this film. The plot just keeps going and going. There is no time for boredom. There are great characters. There is the gestapo character. There is the crazy French archaeologist. There is the Egyptian friend and archaeologist. And, then there is Indiana Jones. I sense a great deal of mockery and parody within the film as well. There is the scene where Indiana Jones shoots the knife master, instead of fighting him. Allegedly, Ford had a bad stomach ache that day. By cutting out the fight scene, they unwittingly had one of the funniest scenes ever captured on camera. There was the silliness and bureaucracy of governments, who were afraid of the power of the ark, but also intrigued. It was the mixture of adventure, parody, and humor that really makes this one of the greatest adventure films. Indiana Jones definitely was the first modern adventure movie. I don't think that any adventure movie since cannot consider Indy to be anything other than the genesis of all adventure films within the last three decades.",

Some films, on the other hand, just make you grin from ear to ear as you remember the sheer thrill of experiencing them for the first time. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is happily one of those second types of films, a movie you do not passively watch so much as you careen through with equal measures of fear and glee. It's the two-hour equivalent of the best amusement park ride you've ever been on, and I mean that as a sincere compliment. The opening scene alone is worth the price of a rental, as Harrison Ford's immortal Indiana Jones escapes an evilly booby-trapped treasure chamber only to run right into, and then past, an ambush. It contains one of the best fight scenes ever filmed, and possibly the best chase scene ever filmed.

Harrison Ford is archaeologist Indiana Jones. The Jones character is a fedora-wearing, bull whip-slinging, adventurer who fights Nazis while traveling the world in search of ancient treasures. The Ark is the chest which held the Ten Commandments. The Nazis want it because legend has it that any army which possesses the Ark will be invincible. Indy's comedic instincts save the movie. The scene where he shoots the sword-wielding Arab is funny and unexpected. The close calls, narrow escapes and nonstop action is mind-numbing. The face melting is a bit much.

This movie has your typical 1981 comedy, such as the woman screaming, ""Indieee! Come save me!"" The movie is basically about Indiana Jones searching for the raiders of the lost ark, some sort of object that is supposed to be a gateway to God and has unbelievable powers beyond our understanding, (think of an alien civilization) but unlike an alien civilization, people actually believe Indiana Jones, knows about it's existence and there's no one laughing and making Indiana Jones go around the country to prove himself, or else this movie would suck.

Especially, a stunt towards the end of the film where Indy is dragged behind a truck. Kudos to Harrison Ford and Vic Armstrong for risking their lives for our entertainment.
Secondly, the acting, even from secondary characters is great. All the characters, be it Marion or Sallah are memorable. Also, this is a movie where all the jokes land.
Lastly, the music. The music composed by John Williams in this movie is one of the best music of all time.

517,11 April 2020,krational66,7, Subject background analysis,"""
I have come to see this film with reverence, both for films made before I was born and for the subject matter.
I won't say much about filmmaking, the acting, the special effects, the structure, the sound, etc., which was more than expected in those days. I on the background environment 81 my opinion!
First of all, starting from the selection of the film, the United States is a Christian country, more than 90% of the people are christians, ""ark of the covenant"" is a Christian holy things, any difference of views on the Christian holy things is very fatal, so the film is very risky to choose this theme. Of course, this also determines the specific location of the film, the specific shape.
The ark of the covenant was made by Moses at the direction of god when he received his version of the ten commandments on mount sinai (ps: a metaphor for zion in the matrix) when he came out of Egypt. The Hebrews were convinced that the ark was a symbol of god's almighty power, and they received guidance and wisdom from it. At the same time, god's power will manifest itself through the ark. Almost all biblical accounts of the ark depict it as a weapon of war. In the battle of Jericho, the Hebrews carried the ark of the covenant and blew the trumpets. In this way, the ""efficacy"" of the ""ark of the covenant"" also determines the historical background of the film. Fasthis seeks for the ""meaning"" of the ark, hoping to win the war through the power of the ark.
The ark was sacred to the israelites, and no one was allowed to touch it. According to the bible, someone was killed by lightning for touching the ark of the covenant. Even a look is burned by the flame, indy says at the end of the film: ""don't look. Keep your eye shut!"" So that determines what the final plot and special effects are going to look like.
The bible has a detailed description of the ark :(quote)
""Make the tabernacle and all its furnishings according to the pattern I will show you.
Exod 25:10 ""you shall make a chest of acacia wood, two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide and a cubit and a half high.
""You shall overlay it with pure gold and make a gold molding around it.
""You shall also cast four gold rings and put them on its four feet, two rings on this side and two rings on that side.
""You shall make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
""You shall put the poles in the rings beside the ark to carry it.
""The poles shall remain in the rings of the ark; they shall not be drawn out.
""You shall put in the ark the testimony which I am about to give you.
""You shall make a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
""Then you shall make two cherubim (angels) of hammered gold at the two ends of the mercy seat.
Make one cherub on one end and one cherub on the other end; of one piece shall the cherubims be of the mercy seat at its two ends.
Then the cherubim shall spread their wings over the mercy seat. And the cherubim shall face to face, toward the mercy seat.
""You shall put the atonement cover on top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the testimony which I will give you.
This determines that the ark of the covenant in the film must be made in accordance with such ""ark"" props.
It is also a lot of people think the indy films will be found in Egypt's ""ark"", I want to put forward my opinion, there is a folk statement has never been confirmed: it is said that the temple of Babylon invaded, plunder, the ark was smuggled out of Jerusalem, by the king Solomon, the son of memmel nico risked their lives to secure transfer. Melenico took the ark with him to Ethiopia, where he stayed in the land of his mother, the queen of sheba.
There is also the claim that the babylonian invasion of Jerusalem was a booty, which is not true because in 586 BC the babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar ii attacked Jerusalem, destroyed the temple and enslaved the Hebrews. However, there is no mention of the ark among all the booty listed in the bible that the babylonians brought back to earth, a hint that it had disappeared by then. (but that's not to say it's impossible to find clues in the loot.)
It says in the movie that Egypt took the ark of the covenant from the temple of Solomon when they invaded Jerusalem. At this point I would like to make my point: the ark disappeared long before the Egyptian invasion of Jerusalem, 1000 years ago. In the time of king Solomon of Israel no power could invade Jerusalem. So the old folklore story is more reliable, and it's a pity that Steven spielberg didn't take it.
Oh, I just put forward my opinion, hope someone can correct the mistake. Expect more people to study it.

In all the years since this style became popular, maybe even revolutionized by Raiders, the Lost Arc still is one of the most effective users of this pacing.

The first adventure that Indiana Jones embarks on is amazing and is for all the family (if you can deal with planes.) I suggest that you buy this now, because Harrison Ford is full of gold! 10/10

530,2 October 2006,ryan_kuhn,9," ""At least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady a good time...""","Steven Spielberg was supposed to direct Return of the Jedi, but Hollywood politics intervened, and instead, we got the Ewoks. OK, the Ewoks were probably going to be in the movie whether Spielberg was involved with the movie or not, but the weakest of the original Star Wars movies is one of those ""What if?"" moments, as I think about how the saga could have ended if the visionary director was involved. The primary reason for this thinking is that just two years before the release of Jedi was Raiders of the Lost Ark, a collaboration between George Lucas and Spielberg. The story goes that Lucas and Spielberg were trying to come up with a story for a James Bond movie when it looked like they were going to have a crack at the franchise. Unfortunately for them, the Bond people went a different direction, allowing Lucas and Spielberg to use some of the ideas they had in their mind to come up with the character ""Indiana Jones,"" a swashbuckling archaeologist who escapes the inescapable situations, restores truth and order, and gets the girl in the end. The movie Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first of three adventures following Indy around the world, and the movie that features the best of Indy's girlfriends. Fresh off his Han Solo success, Harrison Ford fell into the role of Jones, as Tom Sellick was originally tapped to play the role. The movie is a series of adventures, ranging from the jungles of South America (who hasn't seen the big ball rolling toward Indiana Jones), to the mountains of Nepal, finally ending the deserts of Egypt. Karen Allen plays Marion, a former lover of Indy's, one that has been jilted in the past. We get the feeling the first time we see Marion and Indy in the Nepal bar that Indiana is the type that has trouble keeping girlfriends, and Marion is the only one he could possibly be with. The movie revolves around Indiana trying to find the fabled Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do, as Hitler wants to use the power of the Ark to win his conquest of the world. Breathtaking adventures, fantastic chase sequences, and a wry sense of humor (the scene where Indiana beats his sword carrying adversary is one of the biggest laughs in any movie I can think of) makes Raiders of the Lost Ark an adventure film that holds even to this day. When the movie ended, I was disappointed that it was over, as I wanted the adventure to continue. It did, later in the decade, with two sequels, with plans for the fourth edition to come out in 2008.",

I started wondering if its mainly for kids , but then the kill count is pretty high .
The story is ok-ish with some weak moments .
Harrison Ford is a movie icon with presence and makes up for a script that should have been better at some moments .

In a way the movie does try create its own ""feel "" .
Some typical things like "" scary animals "" , or the bad guys die in some strange "" shocking "" way , return in the next movies and are bit of trademark .

537,29 October 2007,Ibuk,9, Raiders of the last ark-,"Harrison Ford has starred in two of my favourite movie franchises- Star Wars and the Indiana Jones trilogy. Harrison Ford will be mostly remembered for two roles, the first being Han Solo the second being Indiana Jones. Right from the moment go, where Indiana Jones is chased by a boulder you know you are in a rollicking adventure. The movie is basically a barrage of stunts put together beautifully. Denholm Eliott provides fantastic support as his sidekick Marcus. This was easily the best in the trilogy, apparently there are talks of another sequel in the making but don't hold me to it. Harrison Ford after Star Wars you have me proud again.",

It has some great action, some great characters and everything in here is about the rule of cool. Indiana Jones is a perfect character who gets everything right. He is smart, strong and catches every woman he wants. This would usually not be a great idea for a character, but it works perfectly in here. The difference between Indiana Jones and any self-insertion character, is that, actually, even if i don't look for self-insertion, is a very fun character. He has personality, and even if it doesn't have flaws, at least is entertaining to watch. The film is also great generating suspense, constructing the mystery of the lost ark, and at the end, giving a very satisfying conclusion. Great story, great action, simply great. Raiders of the lost ark is one of the, if not the, most memorable films i've ever seen. Even if the characters were boring, the scenes work perfectly.",

It was just a bunch of mindless explosions and chase scenes. However,I understand that a great deal of people do in fact enjoy watching this kind of film and that I should have expected this kind let down from an action film. Although,on the same note, I expected it to have more substance. I probably would have appreciated it more if it had maybe, oh, I don't know, a real plot or story of some kind.

Indiana Jones has become one of those franchises that has made it's way into the culture and is here to stay. The film is so much fun to watch, it has great acting and action, and has a compelling narrative that gets you thinking. This movie is a quintessential adventure film, with a relatively simple plot that draws in Nazi's and history is such a pleasing way. Harrison Ford is a huge part of what makes the movie work, although credit should also go to George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. The special effects are pretty good for being over 40 years old. The handling of the Ark of the Covenant is done pretty well overall. It is not something I would deem to be 100% biblically accurate, but it does have a reverence for it.

The plot is a competitive quest for the Ark of the Covenant, a real, religious artifact that Indiana Jones endeavors to find. While in competition with Nazi Germany, at that time (late 1930's), Jones goal is to find it, and place it with his friend, a keeper of the local museum. The Nazi's, under rule of Adolf Hitler have their own plans for the Ark – one's that could put the whole world at risk. Yet, with the Nazi's against him, and in pursuit, with many more resources than he has, Indiana Jones has to improvise a lot. A reluctant partnership with his former love, Marion, takes the character development to a new level, as Indy, who is used to watching his own back is forced back into a protector of another – Marion. As Indy later realizes, it's not just his fate that he is protecting/preserving, or even that of Marion, but in fact the whole world.",

561,28 January 2018,moshomaniac,10," Raiders of the Lost Ark: A tribute to the film serials of the 1940s, and one of the all-time greatest movies","In writing this review, I'll say at the very beginning, I love this movie. It reigns supreme as my all-time favorite. Conceived by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, this movie, released in June of 1981(a month before I was born) was an instant box-office smash, giving birth to Indiana Jones, played to perfection by Harrison Ford, coming off his success from Star Wars(1977) and Empire Strikes Back(1980). The film captures the spirit of the Saturday Matinee with an absolute brilliance. It action-packed, it's funny, it has fantastic visuals, great acting all around, it is a winner in every regard. Released 3 years prior to the PG-13 rating, the film does contain some scenes of fairly intense gore and blood (which would probably warrant a PG-13 today), but I think that a mature 11 year old can probably handle it. I also must mention the score, done by John Williams, the ""Raiders March"" is quite possibly the most exciting and invigorating score I've ever heard, instantly establishing the film's adventurous tone, and the theme for the ark of the covenant is mysterious and wrought with intrigue. Its interesting also to note that the submarine from 1981's DAS BOOT(directed by Wolfgang Peterson of The Never-ending Story) was rented for one scene. Indiana Jones became of the most recognizable characters of the 1980s, and the original fedora was donated to the Smithsonian. Overall, Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of Steven Spielberg's best films, and a great American classic that no video collection should be without. 3 sequels followed: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom(1984); Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade(1989); and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull(2008); but none truly captured the spirit of the Saturday Matinee more than this essential classic. What more can be said except, if you haven't seen this, check it out!",

The movie simply hits every point, the characters are fully developed (for an adventure movie of course, it's no cinéma vérité), the plot is interesting and the visual effects are just the best you could get back then. Not to speak about the actors, Ford is just perfect as Indiana Jones (and that's why he will always be Indy for the rest of his career), Karen Allen was a strong actress and the supporting roles really work as friends or baddies. Comparisions with the two sequels are hard, this one is way too much better filmed, written and acted. The latest, useless installment is not even a challenge to me, being the lowest point of the Lucas-Spielberg franchise, and the gravestone of the great late Indy character. In the end, even if you don't like the genre this film is good entertainment for two hours.",

So when I put it on I was expecting an absolute masterclass of a movie, and unfortunately that's not what I got. I think the main reason this movie didn't hit with me is maybe because I came into this movie too late, and that I found the story although been proven to be flawed it was great nonetheless, but I found the action a bit of a slapstick and did feel aged. With the villain and the nazis they were not convincingly terrifying as nazis should be, and they where times I forgot who the antagonist of the movie was. So In the end I was disappointed, but it wasn't bad, I think I was expecting way too much from other peoples opinions. I think I will continue the franchise and see what the other movies are like, and to end this review I must say I didn't expect that brutal ending and the deaths of the villains.",

This film and its predecessors kept me at the end of my seat. I found few if any boring moments in this movie. The story line kept me guessing and wondering if all would turn out well. Even the love story parts kept me watching with held breath. The story kept me guessing about what events were to unfold and I never did predict them correctly. This movie is an original and stands out as a real classic. Harrison Ford was at his best. The story never looses its pace and stays believable.

Years and decades later when I watch it again, it really does not touch me in the same way. I mean I had to literally dump my logic while watching it. There were thousand of rounds of bullets going past Dr. Jones and none touching him. From land to air to underground to water, Dr,Jones is doing whatever he likes. He kills nearly a hundred Nazi soldiers. I mean its too hard to accept as an adult. In the end, the only takeaway is the theme music. Show it to your teenager kid. He will definitely like it.

He enlists the help of Marian (Karen Allen) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies). This leads him on the greatest adventure of intrigue, mystery, and action reminiscent of the Saturday Morning Serials. My only gripes were that the heavies were not that interesting. His archaeologist rival, Belloq, is uninspired and boring. The lead Nazi Generals, are also boring. Of course, the audience will automatically hate them simply because they are Nazis. Their actions are not really vicious. Probably what really sets this movie apart is the believability. Despite Ford becoming a one-man army, he shows his weakness. In one scene, Ford recovers the Ark from the Nazis by catching up with them, swerving to get them out of the truck, beating up the two in the front, and riding underneath the truck to survive. Almost immediately after, he is on a ship and is in so much pain he can barely get his shirt off. We get to see scars on his hand from the fighting. Indiana Jones is human. Raiders works because the story holds up, the humor holds up, and so do the leads. Indiana Jones it the part Ford was born to play, and Allen gives Marian great strength. Finally, the action is unrelenting, and serves the story well. This is the greatest. I will never get tired of watching it.",
579,8 March 2007,Tankard22,10, One of the Best Ever,"This is right up at the top of my list for one of the best movies ever. Okay, so maybe I'm shallow compared to some of you but for me this movie has it all! It is one of those films that comes along rarely it is flawless! The casting for each and every character is perfect! Harrison Ford was born to play this character; seldom have I seem such an amazing performance by an actor Alec Guinness and Peter O'Toole included. His every expression and reaction is a joy to watch. He embodies Indiana Jones so well that this character will be what he is remembered for most - even over Han Solo.",

Harrison Ford is excellent as Indiana Jones, the school-teacher who acts like an adventurer. The scene where Harrison Ford calmly shoots the man threatening him with a saber 20 feet away ranks way up there in my top 5 all-time sequences.

While you shouldn't argue that this isn't Spielberg's best directed film, it certainly stacks up as one of his most action packed.

588,30 January 2008,Marx_Bros_Fan86,10, Excellent Action/Adventure movie,"I'm writing this review just four months before the release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and I'm thinking about what exactly made Raiders so memorable. It's a throwback to action serials from the 1930's, and it has a certain timeless feel, something that most 80's movies don't have. But a lot of credit has to go to Harrison Ford for portraying a flawed hero who got by by the skin of his teeth. He also has Ophidiophobia, a fear of snakes, which makes the snake pit scene all the more suspenseful yet humorous at the same time. Indiana Jones has become one of the most iconic film heroes of our time. There's always something appealing about treasure hunters, I guess because we want to be them, but the kind of treasures Indiana Jones goes after are more rare than just treasure chests filled with gold. One of the reasons Raiders works better than its sequels is its treasure hunt plot. It drives the story completely and is not obscured by any other element. The Ark of the Covenant is surrounded by an aura of mystery and danger that the other artifacts didn't have. The actual hunt for the Ark is fascinating too. The map room scene is one of my favorite sequences in the film. ",

Indy is assigned the job of finding this Ark and his rivals in this movie are the Germans(Nazis to be precise). The movie is an absolute entertainer and there is not a damn dull moment in it Spielberg has maintained a great balance of comedy and thrills with a background of sometimes weird and sometimes exemplorary romance . Every single frame in the movie has a certain ""Spielberg Touch"", which is the hallmark of the great director. The next movies of the series were good but did not manage to create an impact as huge as this one. A must watch for sure, I recommend it wholeheartedly to all cinema lovers",
596,26 November 1998,Mickey-2,10, One of the classic adventure-action movies Hollywood has made in a long time,"The movie ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" has everything a viewer could ask for. From the opening scene, where Indy establishes himself as a go-for-broke adventurer doubling as a mild-mannered university professor, to the climatic scene where the lost Ark's contents are opened for inspection by ""unworthies"", the movie goes from one big adventure to another.  It plays like one of the 15-chapter serials that used to be made, as there are so many cliff-hanging escapes by Indiana Jones and his friends.  This film gave birth to two sequels that featured their own escapades, but this should rate as the best.  ""Raiders"" gives a new and exciting meaning to the term ""CLASSIC"".",

Special effects are still strong (for the most part), the action set-pieces are pretty realistic and well shot, but it's the lovable charm of Jones that truly takes the cake.

While you shouldn't argue that this isn't Spielberg's best directed film, it certainly stacks up as one of his most action packed.

The truth is, this film did not invent the action-adventure genre. Now, with special effects tools becoming more advanced by the day, the action-adventure films are more spectacular than ever before.

648,5 August 2007,keesha45,10," ""I'm missing you already""","Sallah wasn't the only one who was saddened to say goodbye to Indiana Jones. At the end of this showing at the Garland Theatre, we all had to bid him a reluctant adieu. Anybody that hates snakes, Nazis and unscrupulous treasure hunters is a hero to be admired. This was the first film in the saga of Indiana Jones, and what a character he was and will be again, if the fourth film in the series makes it to the big screen next year. It would be hard to top this first one, although the third picture had some more character development than the others and Sean Connery nearly stole the flick from Ford in one of Connery's most memorable roles since playing James Bond. Let's hope he will appear in the next one in a flashback, since he was killed off in his last appearance. There's little I can add to the hundreds of user comments posted here already. But I will say that we can all thank MAGNUM P.I. for RAIDERS' success. Had Tom Selleck been able to leave MAGNUM and play the Indiana Jones role as Lucas and Spielberg apparently wanted, he, not Ford, would have been the face of the franchise. I can't see anyone but Harrison Ford playing Indy. Perhaps Selleck could have had the kind of career that Ford enjoyed after playing Indy, but I doubt it. Selleck never got such a plum role offered again and the casting decision of Ford for Selleck makes for a terrific what-if scenario had it gone the other way. It's probably my second favorite what-if Hollywood story. Number one on my list goes back to 1968 when a series called STAR TREK was cancelled because the NBC network thought it was too cerebral and too expensive to produce, so they put ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH-IN in the show's time slot. When STAR TREK was cancelled, it became the Cinderella that was rejected by the evil network, that became a hit in syndication and went on to spawn a series of successful movies and TV series as no other TV series has done before or since. If the fans had gotten their fill of STAR TREK after a few more seasons on the network, would it have gained the impetus to take off like it did with later movies and TV sequels? I think not. And neither would it be the same RAIDERS trilogy without Harrison Ford. Dale Roloff",

I immediately knew I had to see the movie. When I finally convinced someone to take me it was one of the most magical experiences of my movie going life. Up until then only two movies had made me feel that way in the theater: Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Little did I know that the two great directors had come together to product this masterpiece. It borrows the best of movie serials of the past, the adventure stories and travel pieces of the time, fantasy, history and features the best villains ever in the world: Nazis!!! Yes. These guys stink. I had learned about them in regular school, Hebrew school and TV. I hated them for what they had done to my ancestors and here was Indiana Jones going around kicking Nazi but at every turn. OK so for a little while it looked like they had the upper hand but in the end G-d gave it to them good. Just like they deserved. If all the adventure and excitement wasn't enough the last scene was a perfect blend irony. All that for nothing. I guess in a way the U.S. Government did one thing right. They packed it away in some unassuming box in a cavernous warehouse so that no one would ever find it again. Harder to find than the Well of Souls that place. I loved this movie front to back, beginning to end and it inspired my own writing and creativity. The period and the sets still resonate in my mind. And a soundtrack that just won't quit. Don't get me started on the sheer genius of John Williams' soundtracks. These three men are singlehandedly responsible for my dreams, my fantasies and my adventurous spirit. I wanted to live in the places they created, go where Indiana Jones went and see what he saw. Some say that they ruined cinema but I don't agree. I think they made it great just doing what they loved: Making Great Movies!",

Seagal and Jackie may be formidable, but Indiana Jones has style and guts, and tackles Nazis and the supernatural to boot.

Raiders of the Lost Ark proudly introduced Indiana Jones to the world. He fights as both an archaeologist and an adventurer to get ahold of the treasures he is looking for. He will stop at nothing to get the Germans out of his way, but the action sequences are extraordinary and it's great to see Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood team up and find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford make a great trio together and all come up with Indiana Jones' greatest adventures. Watching Raiders of the Lost Ark made me want to rush off and watch the next installment of the famous trilogy. I recommend Raiders of the Lost Ark for anyone interested in the adventures of archaeology and a of course the World War II subject. Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford have outdone themselves in the production and a brilliant classic adventure film was born!

This film is the perfect way to make the world aware of the greatest adventurer of all time, Indiana Jones. The Ark of the covenant is the best possible object for Indi to try and take out of the armies of darknesses hands.

It looks like Indi is about to embark in a intense fight scene, but Indi pulls out a gun shoots him and moves on. Its comical, but also it brought realism to me of how Indi is in control and calm during these fights.

679,16 February 2007,timkretschmer,5, The first step on the way to a really good Idiana Jones movie!,"Why do I think the third Indiana Jones is far more better and thus deserves to be voted better than the first one does: 1.) It has the right humor. Indy is not so dogged like in the first one. 2.) It features a beautiful woman, not a strange and manlike wannabe beauty like ""Raiders"" does. 3.) It features a sophisticated screenplay with character development and supporting subplots. 4.) It shows us more of the great location where it is staged on. 5.) It features better actors like Sean Connery is. So, to make my point as clear as possible: ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" lacks exactly these five points. - In spite of this, it is a good movie and, after all, the one in which the basic idea of Indiana Jones is introduced. But if you can only see one Indiana Jones, than please do yourself a favor and choose the ""Last Crusade""",

It's the perfect adventure film, it raised the bar for the genre to such a high point, that I personally haven't been able to view any other movies of this type without making comparisons. But really, I can't think of any movies that have even tried to attempt to capture the excitement of Raiders. There have been other adventure films in the last twenty years, but none have really been on the scale of this, or any of the Jones films. The movie is a laugh riot on top of everything else. I was watching it not too long ago with my father, during the famous scene between Indy and the swordsman who takes a knife to a gunfight he remembered how the audience was in hysterics, how it was one of the biggest laughs he had ever had at a movie (I was too young to remember). This film inspires these types of memories in a lot of people, which pretty much guarantees its status as one of the greatest films ever made.

This is the first,classic Indiana Jones adventure in which he gets an assignment to find the Ark of commandments itself,to prevent it from being taken into possession by the Nazis(this is supposed to be in 1936 and the superstitious dictator Hitler is crazy about the occult). A lost artifact,which may still be in the possession of his old mentor professor Ravenwood,will be essential in this quest so his first destination is Tibet,Ravenwood's last known resort.Ravenwood is however no longer alive,so he then travels to Egypt,accompanied by Ravenwood's (at first) somewhat reluctant daughter/Indy's previous crush Marion(Karen Allen).The Nazis have discovered Tanis,a lost Egyptian city where the Ark is believed to be buried...so there's naturally no time to lose.",

Known for his overdone sentimental drivel, Spielberg actually harnesses his weaknesses as a film maker and limitations and made a damn near perfect film for its kind. Sure it has alot of the typical trappings of his movies (gosh darned evil Nazis in Spielberg flick, who would have guessed???)but you cant deny its a fun romp, and the subject matter is far more fun than the propaganda laced agenda he usually provides. Costuming and scenery is superb as well...",
707,21 January 2018,zianimustafa,8, Raiders of the Lost Ark(1981),"Steven Spielberg's film still looks sexy after more than three decades. Spielberg and George Lucas gave Harrison Ford (who had worked with Lucas previously in Star Wars) a unique role, as an adventurer and lover of the archaeologist named Henry Jones Jr. - known as Indiana Jones, or just Indy.
He works as a professor wearing glasses, but in holidays he adventurer does not know fear, with his hat. When the Nazis discover the whereabouts of the Ark of the Covenant (which will give them an unstoppable power), Jones must stop them.
In my opinion, the film has the best key I've ever seen, filled with a host of memorable pieces (such as Ford's giant rock hunt), by the great cinematographer Douglas Slokamp. In addition to John Williams who composed music nominated for Oscar, which was performed by the London Symphony.
Raiders Of The Lost Ark was the biggest box office film in 1981 and has won nine Oscars, including the best director. Winning the best art output, best editing, best sound, best visual effects and finally the best sound effects.
The cast on Ford is also good. With Paul Freeman, who plays the role of French archaeologist René Bellock, Denholm Elliott played the role of Jones' colleague at the college (Marcus Prodi). And ""Karen Allen"" in the role of Habiba Jones (Marion Ravenwood).
The film also adds some humor. There is a fascination and vitality for this film, which Spielberg later admitted was ""the first film where I actually visualized without thinking."" Really attractive film. One of the best action and adventure movies, Raiders Of The Lost Ark is really fun as a whole.",

710,13 November 2006,peterparker212,10, Arguably the best Jones film yet....,"Indiana Jones the Raiders of the Lost Ark is arguably the best Jones film ever made. The story is set in the late 1930's and involves a archaeologist/ college professor/ adventurer undertaking many great feats and revolutionizing the world as we know it. Indian is played by Harrison Ford and is in my opinion one of his best roles, his acting is not fake or over exaggerated as some movies are which were made during this period. Also the director Steven Speilburg makes this title one not to miss. The Ford/Speilburg team is not the only reason this movie is so attracting, it contains realistic and contains character the audience can relate to, it is constantly surprising and the storyline is addictive, unlike somemovies, the story pulls you away fromreality,off your sofas and into the movie screen, (a trait all good movies should have). The special effects are top class for its day and are realistic. It incorporates a mixture of action and adventure to create a truly enthralling film. I am a passionate Jones fan and I am awaiting eagerly for its forth installment. The Jones trilogy is a set of films that all true fans of the adventure genre should own, it is a movie for the whole family and can be watched over and over again, it thrills and captivates the audience and has an explosive story line.",

Even after watching it over and over again, you can still find something that you haven't recognized before. In addition to finding something new every time you watch it, the things you have already seen never get old. Who didn't want to have a bull-whip when they first saw the movie? Who didn't dream of exploring ancient ruins, dodging vicious traps, and fighting the ""bad guys"" when they were young. Who didn't want to become an archaeologist after seeing Professor Jones in action? Watching Indiana Jones, takes you back to the good old days (1981), when archaeology professors were still real men, when cute petite brunettes could still take any man in a drinking game, and when special effects were still handmade. I have to say it really hasn't lost its appeal; it rather grows on me every time I see it.",

I have probably seen it over 100 times, and it never seems to get old.  This wonderfully comical, old fashioned adventure film is still (20 years later) one of the most exciting, adrenalizing, thrill rides ever crafted for the screen.  Easily watchable any time any day, I frequently return to it if I am in need of a surefire smile.  For some reason I have always found myself fonder of The Indiana Jones trilogy than I have Star Wars.  Both films feature eye popping stunts and special effects, entertaining sympathetic characters and old fashioned acts of courage.  But the Indy trilogy has always hit a nerve with me. Directed by the grand master entertainer Steven Spielberg, RAIDERS manages to take every man's most potent childhood fantasies and put them magically on the screen.  The opening with the giant boulder, the room full of snakes, the remarkable chase sequence on the truck.  If I had to make a list of films that most entertain me every time I see them, Raiders would be at the top.  Phenomenal filmmaking that introduced to the world the now legendary character of Indiana Jones.  Harrison Ford is the perfect everyman, and he leaves an indelible impression in the role.",

The cinematography, musical score, the characters all breathe life into the movie so well. The action sequences are really exciting and Harrison Ford is at his best in bringing archeologist Indiana Jones to life. I enjoy the character so much because he does not come off as a superhero. He seems human, not invincible as some screen heroes are often portrayed coming through huge trials without a scratch. Sure Indiana Jones does some things that seem over the top or impossible, but his character isn't without flaws. He is human and gets beaten up pretty badly as he goes through numerous trials and tribulations.",

Ofcourse Harisson ford ain't no James Bond that's why his character changed through the movies. The direction is superb, the script is just right and ofcourse the spectators are happy to see Karen Allen as the femme-fatale(not with the current meaning of the word) of the series.

The story is pretty good, incorporating action and a little bit of comedy and drama. Harrison Ford does a good job at acting, as always.

The protagonists gaily wreak havoc with no apologies. There is no psychology or character. The hero is brave - a cheap virtue since he's obviously invulnerable. The cultural icons dragged in to lend an exotic tone were given the most superficial treatment - everything was a throwaway, but none of it was stylish, witty or funny.

725,11 January 2003,jimmycool20012000,10, Indiana Jones is the best film in the world!,"I can not think of any film that has captivated me as much as Raiders of the Lost Ark. This film is perfect. First of all i want to sat that Harrison Ford deserved an oscar nomination for his performance in this film. He is just great. He is much more than just a standard action hero, we see both the good and bad aspects of the character. I also love the way he portrays humour, like when he shots the swords man. I can not imagine anyone else in this role and think that had Tom Selleck got the role the film would not have been as successful. Denholm Elliot is great as Indiana's most trusted friend, as is Karen Allen as his love interest. The bad guys are also good. I like it that the main the main bad guy (played by Paul Freeman) is in many ways similar to Indiana Jones. This gives the film something more than most action films where there is a clear distinction between the bad and good guys, in Raiders there is not. I can't think of the words to sum up Spielberg's direction, he is simply perfect. This is by far his best movie. I like almost all of his films, but this is his shinning moment. In closing this is the best film ever watch it when your young and it will change your life, i don't know anyone who isn't an Indiana Jones fan. I hope they make a 4th film!",

Inspired by many of the 1930's serial films like its cousin Star Wars, Raiders keeps you on the edge of your toes.

I believe it would not have been as good, but that is speculation at this point) who plays the character with a bit of tongue in cheek and zeal like only Ford could in his prime. From the start of the movie it starts a non-stop roll of events that gives you just enough time to breath and soak in the last scene of action. It uses the old map trick to convey travel and sends us on a world wind adventure. Indy has a quote in the movie-""It's not the years, it's the mileage."" This film suffers neither age or mileage.

No matter how many times you do see Raiders, it will always seem new to you: the idea, the plot line and the thrill of it all. Upon watching the AFI George Lucas Tribute, I found out the story behind Indiana Jones: Lucas and Spielberg had combined ideas to create a fantastic hero. I think the thing I like about Indiana Jones is that he's human, he doesn't have any superpowers, he does fear things but he still manages to save the day. He's a brilliant creation, complete with whip and lucky hat. This is one of those films that has everything put in it; but is one of the few films that manages to pull it off well. This is probably one of the reasons many programmes put in less-than-subtle parodies of this movie (especially the famous 'rolling boulder' scene).

I am not sure how this film got a PG certificate upon release as some of the scenes are too graphic for children.

Raiders is the wonder of cinema. Filmed in beautiful Scope, with a great score, fantastic action, wonderful effects and an exiting story-line, this film does still look like it was made yesterday. It was very successful and brought the adventure genre back in the race. After it many have tried to make an equally appealing adventure film.

755,4 January 2002,johnprestonevans,9, Action as an Art,"Action and adventure dont get any better than they do in Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Director Steven Spielberg and Producer George Lucas team together to create one of the most exciting cinematic experiences ever.  It is the first film in the Indiana Jones series and is by far the most creative and original.  Harrison Ford is legendary as Dr. Indiana Jones, a globe-trotting acheologist professor who must attain the lost ark of the covenant before the evil Nazi empire does.  Ford's performance as rugged, brainy and comical Jones is his defining role.  He is the perfect Indiana.  It is impossible to imagine anyone else in this role and he is a joy to watch.  The supporting characters are brilliant as Jones must travel far and wide to battle a rival French archeologist and his allegance to the 3rd riech.  The film works because Spielberg develops his characters well and the audience truely cares about them.  It is an archipal good versus evil film where desperate action scenes leave us cheering for Jones and his allies.  The script and plot is quick and clever.  John Williams scores an inspirational soundtrack that tells the story inconjunction with Spielberg.  The best action film of all time.  Final Rating = 9.3/10",

When they stated on the poster that this movie was the return of the great adventure, they weren't kidding. What a lot of people aren't aware of is that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas created the Indiana Jones movies as a tribute to the classic adventure films and old film serials that came out during the Great Depression and World War II. Such films that were payed tribute to (or ripped off) were ""Secret of the Incas"", ""The Treasure of Sierra Madre"", ""China"", and ""Gunga Din"". In that regard, it not only does that job, but delivers a timeless movie. I could pop this movie in any day and enjoy it. It never gets old. These movies are about treasure hunting, exotic locations, and great action set pieces. Everything flows perfectly from scene to scene. There's just a perfect balance of drama, humor, action, and romance. It works on every level--",

760,22 February 2006,incanus_is,10, One of the BEST movies ever made,"Who would have thought that taking Han Solo and putting a wide brim, extra tall brown fedora on him, giving him a whip, a PhD and placing him in the 1930s as an archaeologist with a zest for adventure and history would make one of the greatest movies of all time? Truth be told, the thought had occurred to me several times. Raiders is one of the greatest films in the history of cinema, and is a great tribute to the serials of the early film industry. I love Indiana Jones, and you should, too =) Perhaps one of my personal favorite scenes from Raiders is of course, the very beginning sequence, where Indy is in the jungle, along with a young Alfred Molina in tow. For the early 1980s, this film was simply amazing. If you have seen the recent release of DVDs for the film, and have paid attention to the bonus DVD with feature comments, then you know that Spielberg and Lucas tried to do all of the stunts, gags, and other effects and tricks without using special effects, in order to be true to the serials of the past. Today, if there is a scene where it involves a few thousand snakes slithering across the floor, more than likely, a director will want to digitally produce those creatures. In Raiders, no. They brought in asps, cobras, and all sorts of snakes for the Well of the Souls scene. One thing that I never noticed until the bonus DVD pointed it out was the fact that in the scene where Indy falls on his face and ends up having a stare-down with a hooded cobra, there was a glass plate between the two actors. You can see barely a glint of the cobra's reflection in the darkness right in front of Harrison Ford's face. I was stunned, but I laughed a little bit. Every time I see the movie, that scene still unnerves me, but now, I know that one of my favorite actors was not in any real danger. Forever this movie shall live-on in my heart, especially the thrilling score and soundtrack produced by the master of movie music - Mr. John Williams. ""Johnny,"" as Lucas likes to call him, was a perfect choice for this trilogy of adventure flicks. His crescendos are among the best, and his use of thematic music is unparalleled. The Raiders March is the ring tone on my cell phone, as a matter of fact. In short, if you have never seen this movie, watch it. Then, after you watch it, and are hooked, watch Temple of Doom. Then watch the Last Crusade, which is perhaps the most-loved Indiana Jones film of all-time. I hope to God that Raders 4 comes out soon. It is February 2006, and from what I understand, a script has been approved and accepted by Lucas and Spielberg. Let's all cross our fingers and hope that the thrilling sounds of the Raiders March and the silhouette of that famous figure and fedora'ed head and profile light the silver screen once again!",

The future of the free world depends on Jones finding the relic, because ""he who marches with the ark before him is believed to be invincible"". The film mixes fantasy with an actual circumstance that could develop, which keeps the viewer on the edge of his. Jones is faced against his arch enemy Renee Belloq, a French archieologist, who heads the expedition that takes place in random abstract locations around the globe. Jones is joined with Marion Ravenwood, his former teacher's daughter, on this great quest to save mankind. Ronald Lacey is excellent as Toht, Belloq's allie and a sinister villain who will kill anyone who stands in his way. Some great scenes include the infamous ""boulder chasing Indy scene"" and the ""pit full of snakes"". The film also contains the greatest action sequence in the history of filmaking-The Desert Chase. To tell any more would ruin the movie. A film everyone should see, and a film one can watch over and over again. My favorite movie of all time, it is #60 on the AFI's top 100 list.

770,21 September 2008,Gavin59,9, Instant Hollywood Legend,"This was the most popular film in the summer of 1981, and played to packed audiences. It must have resonated with people's emotions as an action film unlike many others. It starts with an adventure - an explorer travels to a savage society in order to steal their wealth (for scientific knowledge of course). He fails when another adventurer expropriates his winnings, but survives to return to his teaching job at a university. The film shows him traveling in a flying Clipper from the 1930s, but not on a railroad. It is a good action film, as long as you don't question some of the scenes. Could Nazi Germany have military forces in 1936 Egypt? Could German Schmeisser sub-machine guns be found in 1936 Nepal? I don't believe so. I suspect these scenes were copied from the 1940 serials that entertained moviegoers. ""Indiana Jones"" will entertain you as an action adventure story with a multitude of clichés from long-forgotten films. Sliding under the truck recalls Yakima Canute's famous stunt. Some scenes seem far-fetched to me (when you think about it). Could Indiana Jones on a horse overtake a convoy of trucks? The theme music came from the 1948 film ""Don Juan"" starring Errol Flynn (rarely seen on TV). The chase through the maze of streets reminds me of 1940 cartoons. Other scenes may be derived from other old movies (the truck knocking down scaffolding from ""Abbot & Costello Meet the Keystone Kops""). A few sequels were made, but it failed to be translated into a television series. Just like ""Jaws"".",

The story of Raiders is, in my opinion, one of the best in film history and the acting is excellent as well. The story deals with Indy being assigned to an important mission- to obtain the Lost Ark of the Covenant from the evil Nazis. Indy moves from continent to continent, running into old friends (and thousands of poisonous snakes!) along the way. The film's best part is a fantastic chase in which the Nazis try to steal the ark away from Indy who has driven away in a truck which is carrying the ark. The film's conclusion, Nazis being wiped out by the power of the ark, is classic, as Indy and Marion escape disaster narrowly.

Jones is a brave and humorous hero but is allowed to show weakness and be afraid, making the character real. Who can forget the line: ""Snakes.

784,9 December 2011,smithj56,9," Action, adventure, artifacts and traps.","Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones, an archaeologist and explorer in the action adventure film Raiders of the Lost Ark, set in 1936, the story follows Indy, as he is often called, as he attempts to beat the Nazis in a race to recover the lost Ark of the Covenant. Karen Allen and John Rhys-Davies join Indy in his quest as Marion Ravenwood and Sallah respectively. Paul Freeman plays Dr. René Belloq, Indy's adversary in the movie. The movie follows Indy in South America where he recovers a gold idol, only to have it stolen by Belloq. His next trip is to Nepal where he acquires the headpiece to the Staff of Ra and a partner, Marion, after a battle with Gobler (Anthony Higgins) and his henchmen. Indy and Marion then travel to Egypt where they meet up with Sallah, enter into several skiffs, Marion is believed to have been killed, the Ark is found, stolen, and then retrieved once again. After retrieving the Ark, Indy and Marion board a boat for America but a Nazi sub shows up and the Ark is stolen yet again; Indy, however, sneaks aboard the sub. The Nazi's stop at a secret island to open the Ark, catch Indy, and tie him and Marion to a post. The Ark is opened and spirits attack those who watched, not including Marion or Indy. The Ark is brought to the United States and stored away in a warehouse. The movie is full of action and adventure, with traps and danger at every turn. The editing was paramount in making this movie a reality as different parts of the same scene are in fact in different location. The very beginning of the movie starts in a cave set in South America, but only the outside of the cave was filmed on location. Indy actually runs out of a set in the US and emerges out in a jungle of South America. This is the only way that the traps and special effects can be properly done. The lighting in scenes such as the ones inside the map room and the Well of Souls is important to the film, but for different reasons for each. The map room required the lighting to move as if it were the sun moving across the sky, changing the lighting as it goes. Inside the Well of Souls darkness needed to prevail while still allowing us to see what was going on. If it had been bright inside the Well of Souls the fear the scene is supposed to portray would be lost. In the end of the film the Ark of the Covenant, which was retrieved by Indy, is placed in a crate and stored in a warehouse. This is important as the warehouse in this film is the warehouse from Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull, another action adventure film starring Indy, loaded with traps, chases, close calls, and filled with historical belief's tied into its plot.",

From the director of ""Jaws"" and the creator of ""Star Wars"" comes the adventure film that all others in its genre are held up to, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". After twenty-three years and counting, I can honestly say that the film has yet to be outmatched (sure there have been good action/adventure films since ""Raiders"", including its own sequels, but I haven't seen a film that has had an indeliable, definitive impact that ""Raiders"" has left in a long time, possibly since the original ""Star Wars"") Hired by the U.S. Government, archaeologist/adventurer, Indiana Jones is on a race against evil to retrieve the lost Ark of The Covenent, the chest that contains the original stone tablets of the Ten Commandments. The ones that Moses brought down from Mount Harab and smashed. When was the last time YOU went to Sunday School!? Along the way Indiana meets up with an ex-girlfriend of his, Marion Ravenwood, outraces and dukes it out with legions of Nazis, and has plenty of close calls including a truck chase, The Well of Souls and its snakes (& Indiana's deathly phobia of them), a slugfest with a mechanic and his flying wing, and the opening of the Ark itself (lets just say GOD isn't to happy when mortals decide to open the Ark & sift through its contents). An absolute modern-day classic. Why? ""Raiders""' opening, from the Paramount logo to the natives chasing Dr. Jones, the bar fight, the basket chase, The Well of Souls, the truck chase (that alone gets 5 stars), the opening of The Ark in all its glory, John Williams' Oscar nominated score, I could go on all day long, but, you get the drift. What gives the film its drive (and where the sequels fail) is the urgency & danger of retrieving the Ark and the competitiveness between Indiana Jones and the Frenchman, Renee Belloq (the film imposes, early on, that these two have been competitors since there college days). I got this on cassette for Xmas 1984 and I burnt the tape out. Thank God for DVD. Nominated for 8 Oscars including Best Picture, Director (Steven Spielberg), Original Score and winning 4 of those awards including Best Sound & Visual Effects. The American Film Institute ranks ""Raiders"" as one of the top 100 films of all-time and Indiana Jones as one of the top cinematic heroes second only to Atticus Finch from ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". The truck chase wasn't directed by Spielberg (he did the close-ups afterwards), but was helned by second unit director, Norman Reynolds. Tom Selleck was originally cast to play Jones but had to back out due to contractual agreements with Universal and CBS for ""Magnum P.I."" (I think it would have been a different film. I saw a ""Raiders"" screen test with him and Sean Young and he came off very obnoxious). Danny DeVito was offered the role for Sallah but declined due to scheduling conflicts with ""Taxi"". The scene where the Nazi officer was supposed to shoot Sallah was filmed but couldn't be used, because of black smoke from burning tires in one take, and in another actor John-Rhyes Davies getting sick and filling his jallaba (and he didn't care one bit). ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is one truly great adventure worth taking over & over again. No matter what George Lucas calls it.",
798,25 August 2015,ghartmansouder,10, One of the best action and adventure movies ever made.,"This movie is a masterwork in so many different ways, from the acting to directing and writing to the entertainment value. Harrison Ford is perfectas Indiana Jones to the point where I can't see anyone else in the role. All the other acting is great, especially Karen Allen as Marion and Paul Freeman as Belloq. The snappy and clever writing by Lawrence Kasdan and the all-around amazing directing by Steven Spielberg are amazing and are perfect for this movie. The action is exciting and very frightening in some places. The movie has an incredible flow and also does a great job at introducing Indiana Jones as a character and at the same time also is a masterwork as a fun movie you can watch on a Friday night.",

There is not much else that can be said about this movie, except that it is a definate must see for people of all ages.",

Spielberg stays away from mocking anybody's religion, which in a film like this is hard to do. He doesn't make the Nazis look to be bumbling idiots, which is usually the case in action comedy's.

This film like the other three films gives you the adventure feels that our main character Indy does. The thing that works very well is the companionship between the director Spielberg and Lucas they created a wonderful adventurous world. The story is so well structured, from the setup to the confrontation, it keeps us at the edge of our seats without a single yawn. Let's talk about Harrison Ford and Karen Allen, their companionship in the movie is amazing Marion (Karen Allen) is not that girl that always needs to be saved by Indy (Harrison Ford), in some occasions she saves Indy's life. Our hero Indy (Harrison Ford) has the word iconic written on his forehead, he is the perfect hero he is charming, bad ass, smart everything a hero needs. The movie has an exceptional movie score by Academy award winning John Williams, his score is tense and brilliant. The movie has incredible shots the cinematography is quite amazing, as well as those visual effects, and nails a perfect editing. The direction from Steven Spielberg is fantastic we can see he really did put effort into the movie. Overall this is one of the best films of all time (My favorite movie) it has action, romance, suspense, and it is for the whole family, the kids will love this film. Seek this film out!",

But at it, not with it. Bet they are not laughing now, considering how famous it's become. I like this movie. In fact, I'm watching it as I type. I certainly think that it is the best out of the four. It has a rawness about it, and a lovely lack of CGI of course, it being 1981. In reading the, 'reviews', I noticed a lot of comments about CGI. But here's the thing. That department is so well established in film studios now, that it would almost be disrespectful not to include them in the 'family of film-makers'. This is on the same principle as writing in scenes that involve snow and rain. It passes the money around and keeps people employed. That's why many films have CGI. I think they have their place, but come on guys. Put creativity first, not finance. The trouble is, it's all getting cheaper to do and solves big production problems. Back to the film. Yes, never a dull moment, plenty of humour, great music and high adventure. It's a film, guys. Get over yourselves, you critics. There are no black holes here. Dr Jones obeys the rules of the universe. No deus ex machina here! Anybody notice how perfect the scene in Nepal was? So well planned and choreographed. As was the plane blowing up sequence.

His 1977 film Close Encounters of the Third Kind was released to similar success, and is now one of the classic of the science-fiction genre. His next film, however, 1941, was a colossal bomb, showing that as good as he was, he wasn't invincible. So for his next project, he turned to his friend George Lucas (Director of Star Wars), and told him of his plans to direct a James Bond movie. Lucas then presented a similar character he had come up with, Indiana Smith, a homage to adventure serials from the forties and fifties. The two then collaborated on the project, with Spielberg directing and Lucas producing, and created what is now known as Raiders of the Lost Ark. (With the protagonist changed from Smith to Jones)",

859,13 May 2014,sawaat,9, One of the best films ever made,"I've known this film for about as long as I can remember, and the entire Indiana Jones trilogy for that matter. When I was a kid, all three of the movies were the same to me, but as I got older I realized that while the sequels do have their good moments (Not including Crystal Skull, yikes) there's really only one of the films that I personally believe still holds up to this day and is the best out of the trilogy. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is exciting, inventive, humorous and classic. Harrison Ford offers a ruggedness and an undeniable charm to the character of Indiana. He's much more three dimensional than my 7 year old self remembers. He's not a perfect hero, he gets hurt, he stumbles and he makes mistakes, which in my opinion, makes the character even more appealing. Karen Allen plays Marion, who I think is the strongest female lead of the trilogy, and Karen was by far the best actress in the series. Not quite damsel in distress material as she proves throughout the film that she can hold her own, and she refuses to be bossed around. Part of what makes this film so fantastic is the details. Spielberg has a great attention to them and despite the film's enormous stature, I found it's the smaller things that make it the success that it is. Every shot is positioned beautifully, particularly in the opening temple sequence. That's not to say that the film's riveting chase sequences and heart-pumping action aren't notable as well. All the elements fall into place beautifully like a perfect jigsaw puzzle. There's little left to be desired and hardly a thing to complain about. If you have not seen this film already, please watch it! I guarantee you won't be disappointed. I'd say that spending a weekend marathoning through the trilogy would definitely be worth your time!",

They are all great but there is something about Raiders that is inprinted on my soul. Analyzing the film now as a 33 y.o. I think it shaped my aestethics in some hidden fashion and it gave me a sence of adventure and a strange athnosphere that i carry with me. Its so positive despite the bodycount and the tresspassing.

There would never be another one like Raiders.",
867,23 February 2001,agentbond,1, One of the best Action/Adventure movies of all-time.,"If adventure has a name...it must be Indiana Jones. That line says it right there. The contrast between this movie and all of the heros before it was that Indy was human. He gets hurt, unlike his predecessor James Bond. With whip and revolver in hand, Indiana was an exotic hero. Indy was sofisticated (a college professor), he was handsome and adventurous. Harrison Ford was liked by all audiences, women found him attractive, men found him daring. Qualities found in Brittish spy, James Bond. Most people know now that Steven Spielberg was denied the directors position for a 007 film. He teamed up with George Lucas to make an American hero- Indiana Jones. There are many parallels between the two characters, but I'm not going to get into that. Another thing that made Raiders great was the plot itself. An archeologist travels around the world to find the Ark of the Covenant- the ark that contained the 10 Commandments and was said to have special powers. Indy gets entangled with a rival French archeologist who is working with the Nazis. An amazing story which keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire time. What keeps you there is not just the plot or action sequences, it is also the score by John Williams. Some of the best soundtracks are from John Williams (Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Superman). This adrenaline-pumping score of the Raiders March makes you wish you had a theme song everytime you walked into a room. This is a great movie, it should be seen by anyone who enjoys a good adventure.",

I am with the reviewer who marveled at the PG rating. But what gets me is that no reviewer is reflecting on the spiritual implications the plot of the movie suggests. At the front of the movie, the Indy character goes for historical biblical authenticity but discounts its spiritual reality. By the end he is surely a believer. The plot most definitely suggests that the Hebrew God not only exists, but jealously guards the ark he commissioned Moses to create as the seat of His Presence. But all Indy or his museum ally suggest is that ark is really powerful and needs to be researched (right). Beloq, in the movie had more spiritual sense than they did. At least he donned the high priestly garb before opening the ark. Unfortunately for him, he was not a real Levite, nor were any of the German soldiers. Consequently they all received an Old Testament style judgment. Here's the reality: At Jesus' death, the veil that kept out the average Joe from the Most Holy Place in the Jewish temple was torn in two. The Person and Presence of God has since moved out and into the heart of every believer who accepts Jesus (God's sacrifice for sin) in their place. God is not content to be a movie convention or literary device! As someone said once, ""If there is no God, nothing matters; if there is a God, then nothing else matters!""",

Raiders doesn't try to be offensive nor does it achieve it, seeing the odd soldier getting pounded is trite now, personally I quite enjoy seeing Nazi's get the thrashing they so deserved.

889,4 September 1999,jez-19,9, Dynamic 2 hours of cinematic magic.,"I've heard various comments in recent years of how Schindler's List is Spielberg maturing as a director. But in reality he matured in 1975 with Jaws, which along with Close Encounters, Raiders, and ET are the director at the very peak of his powers. Schindler, although superb, appears to be the director trying a little too hard to be serious and adult. Raiders is as 'adult' as any film you're likely to see in its remarkably sophisticated technique and mastery of audience manipulation, which along with Jaws even tops Hitch in this area. Spielbergs visual flair is astounding at times in this film, the natural fluidity of camera work and the perfect use of light, particularly in facial lighting is brilliant.

(he was made for the party)... with out a doubt it is definitely one of Spielberg's greatest achievements!.. ranks up there with jaws Schindilers list, Jurassic park, close encounters and not forgetting E.T!! there's not much more to say except, i would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone as it satisfies all audiences.. i would have to say that out of the whole trilogy (soon to be quadigy)this is my personal favorite, it pretty much invents ideas which are now clichés.",
