0,3 August 2001,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, An intense and very terrifying movie that will make you sleep with the bible a few nights in a row,"The Exorcist is one of the best movies to come out of the 70's and deserves better than slowly descending down the top 250. It's one of those essential films you have to see in order to understand what a movie truly is and this is more than a horror film. Unfortunately there are so many people who are saying they got bored, I think because they expected a terrifying movie, people! This isn't a slasher movie, this isn't some scary Michael Myers that you can shoot, this is a story about normal people in a normal house and upstairs there is a little girl who happens to be possessed by ""The devil himself"". Faith is so strong and when it's shaken, anything in your imagination can run wild.",/
1,20 July 2004,clydestuff,10, The Devil Made Her Do It,"In late 1973 and early 1974, women and men were lined up for blocks. People were known to become ill watching it. Some fainted. Some ran out of the theater in tears. There were reports of people having to be institutionalized, and at least one miscarriage was attributed to viewing it. No, it wasn't a Rolling Stones Concert. It was a film called The Exorcist.",r
2,21 October 2018,knersisman,8, The Exorcist,"Stunning visuals, effects and overall horror for 1973. The characters are very strongly portrayed and the feeling of hopelessness is ever-present throughout the movie. Even though some scenes are outright shocking and provocative, there is also a strong element of the uncanny present. This is a very haunting movie that still shocks, amazes and intrigues after all these years.",e
3,6 August 2018,agro_sydney,10, Still A Masterpiece After 45 Years,"I recently revisited this film on Blu-ray after some 45 years. It still rates as one of my favourite horror films, one of my top ten films and a masterpiece of film making. Beautiful photography, great locations, sets, special effects and acting.
It still stands up as a great film today",v
4,13 October 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, One of the few movies to genuinely unsettle me,"The horror genre is a genre that has been growing on me overtime, and I genuinely believe The Exorcist is a landmark of it. Not just how much it's talked about or parodied, but also its ability to unnerve and unsettle me even years later. The Exorcist is a fantastic film, both as a film of its genre and of film full-stop. The effects are superb and have held up very well, and the sound is marvellous and adds to the many startling moments. The cinematography and scenery are also incredibly well done. The macabre, obscene demonstrations of manifest evil on display still startle even now, while William Friedkin's direction is one of his best and most intelligent of his career, not just making the scares genuine but also combining these with allegorical religious subtleties. The performances also lift, Linda Blair is really quite startling, and you couldn't have had more perfect support from Max Von Sydow and Ellen Burstyn. Overall, genuinely unsettling and effective. 10/10 Bethany Cox",i

7,6 December 1998,Collins,10, THE EXORCIST---A PERFECT FILM,"Many people complain that this movie's too slow but those are the kind of folks who only like 80-minute splatter films with characters so dumb and one-sided, you pray for the bad guy to kill them.  This monster of a drama is both beautiful and bold.  It has CHARACTERS and not simply LAMEBRAINS lined up for slaughter.  It has class and purpose.  It takes the audience into the darkest recesses of humankind and then brings them back through a message of hope and self-sacrifice.  The movie is NOT anti-religion, it's anti-evil.  Anyone who likes smart, clever, meaningful horror-drama should see this film at least twice.  It is surprisingly touching and amazingly powerful.",/

The answers are multiple : the dark, the evil, a mysterious presence, death ultimately; in fact, anything incontrollable.

There was ""Star Wars"" for fantasy, ""Alien"" for sci-fi, and ""Jaws"" for the shark crowd, though I don't think that's really a genre. For horror fans, ""The Exorcist"" was the one that had everyone talking in 1973, and not only talking, but lining up around the block to get a chance to see it. In fact, the first time I tried, the person directly in front of me in line was the last one allowed in for that showing.",5

Maybe it's because millennials rate such beautiful classics lower since they're not getting the jump scares and torture porn of the modern era of horror... Not sure.

15,17 October 2020,AlsExGal,7, It just doesn't scare me anymore...,... and it was pretty scary when I saw it in 1974. Maybe the horror has shifted somewhat for me. In 1974 I was 16 and I was sheltered from the horror of real life. So horror films were the only thing that probably could scare me.,5
16,9 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, One of the few films to actually have sickened me,"Well, I couldn't miss the opportunity to see this horror classic in the cinema, or I'd have to wait another 25 years till the 50th anniversary. So I went along to the cinema, where it was playing in an original version (none of this remastered malarkey, I'll thank you very much). And suffice to say, I was impressed. Very impressed.

18,25 August 1999,baumer,6, I almost feel ashamed for not liking this film,"There is a very frustrating scene from Jaws 2 where Brody walks into the selectsmen's meeting carrying the photograph that the two divers took as they were being eaten.  Brody sees the outline of the mouth and the eye. And he should know what a shark looks like.  But when he passes it around, Harry saysSeaweed?"" Verna Fields says, ""it's under water isn't it?  That's why it's so dark?""  They can't see something that is so obviously and that is bothersome.  That is how I feel about my reaction to the Exorcist. Everyone has told me how frightening it is and how it is a psychological trip.  And I know the reaction that audiences had towards it in the 70's. But as much as I try, I just can't see it.  It is not a scary movie and it is not even an enjoyable one, and I would even go so far as to say that it is not even a good movie.",?
19,9 July 2015,anaconda-40658,10, Blair Gets Exorcised!,"The Exorcist (1973): Dir: William Friedkin / Cast: Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb: Terrifying masterpiece based on the book by William Peter Blatty. There are many Biblical accounts where Jesus himself drove demons out of people, so an exorcist is obviously someone who rids what doesn't belong. Ellen Burstyn stars as an actress whose daughter is possessed by demonic forces. After the shocking image of her daughter screaming atop a shaking bed, she seeks professional help. When doctors fail in finding answers it is suggested that a Priest see the girl. Intelligent, shocking with a sense of insight where Burstyn asks the right questions regarding exorcism. Quite an accomplishment for director William Friedkin who previously made another masterpiece in The French Connection. Burstyn brilliantly mirrors frustration mixed with fear. Linda Blair is both sympathetic and commanding as the possessed victim. Jason Miller plays a troubled Priest whom questions his faith after his mother's death. Lee J. Cobb steals moments as a police inspector. Then there is Max Von Sydow is compelling as the exorcist who sensed the demonic force in the film's opening and ultimately understands the standoff he will eventually face. A masterpiece in horror with excellent makeup and spellbinding measures of faith. Score: 10 / 10",r

24,18 July 2021,gregorycanfield,9," The most ""ripped-off"" movie of all time","According to the film critics, the Exorcist is the only movie about demonic possession that should have ever been made. Every subsequent movie with a ""possession"" theme was labeled a ""rip-off."" I'm pretty sure that Beyond the Door was the first ""rip-off."" One film critic described this movie as vulgar. Perhaps. Was the Exorcist any less vulgar? The Exorcist had a good director, good actors and good production values. It is these attributes which set the Exorcist apart from all the follow-up films. However, if you are offended by someone regurgitating green slime, does it really matter whether it's coming from Linda Blair or anyone else? I have always thought that the Exorcist worked as well on a dramatic level as it does a horror movie. This is probably something you shouldn't be able to say about an effective horror movie. I once listened to William Friedkin's audio commentary while watching the movie. He and I agree on which scene is the best part of the movie. It is the exchange between Ellen Burstyn and the great Lee J Cobb. As a police lieutenant, Cobb has more compassion for Burstyn than priest she seeks help from. When Cobb is about to leave Burstyn's house, he says: ""You're a nice lady."" She replies: ""You're a nice man."" This is actually touching! Ironically, this touching scene is directly followed by one of the most wild and disturbing scenes in the movie. In fact, I've always wondered how the movie escaped an X rating with this scene intact. However, I still believe the tender scene which precedes this resonates more. All things considered, the Exorcist is definitely one of the greatest horror movies of all time, as well as one of the most influential. Not number one, though. My choice for Number One took place in Texas. Something to do with chain saws.",t
25,6 March 2004,sddavis63,6, Not Bad; Just Overhyped,"It's hard to believe the furor that was apparently caused when this movie was first released. I was just 10 years old at the time and never saw it in the theatres, and, in fact, only just recently saw it for the first time. It struck me as a pretty standard horror movie about a young girl possessed by the devil. I didn't find it shocking or horrific, and have seen movies that were far more frightening than this.",t
26,22 March 2000,Malcs,10, The Exorcist,"I've never really been much of a fan of horror films because I've never been able to suspend my belief long enough to let a monster scare me. To me psychological demons are much more effective than overdone makeup jobs. I prefer The Haunting with Claire Bloom, or The Shining with Jack Nicholson. But the all-time classic has got to be The Exorcist. One of the reasons The Exorcist always scares the bejesus out of me is because it treats an epistemological subject very seriously, even when the one character you'd expect to step forth willingly, young priest Father Karras (Jason Miller), does his best to dissuade Ellen Burstyn that her daughter is possessed by a demon. Of course, by that time Karras has already confessed to a fellow priest that he's started to lose his own faith because he realizes that the problems he has to deal with of his congregation are too much for one man, especially a man who keeps neglecting his own mother during the last days of her life. I think one of the reasons this is such a successful film is that the concept of a demon is treated as intangibly as our imagination's reach: How WOULD the devil deal with us if confronted? By reading each of our souls, finding whatever carefully hidden secrets there are and spewing them back in our faces as spiritual ammunition. Not only that, but when you see Regan (Linda Blair) in the opening scenes gently horseplaying around with her mother and her sister, the charm and goodness she radiates leaves you completely floored when she finally does become possessed and turns into a creature so horrible that you forget all about Regan. The lynchpin is having Max von Sydow cast as the aging priest who comes to finish off the work that Father Karras has started. Von Sydow who has been Ingmar Bergman's spiritual warrior for so many of his films dealing with the epistemological nature of the universe. And credit must go to Mercedes McCambridge for supplying the voice of the demon.",_
27,4 April 2006,Hitchcoc,9, Don't take it too personally,"I had great anxiety going to this film because I had heard so much about it. I was somewhat justified. I don't know when I've felt quite as uncomfortable in a movie theater. The interesting thing was that I didn't buy into any of the supernatural elements in it. I don't personally believe in a Dante like hell where devils take over our souls and can spin their heads around and burn us for eternity. Yet, the makeup on this young girl, the use of the most base profanity, the special effects, that rumbling voice, hissing, the fog, masterful. The crude, sacrilegious displays were really over the top. This is a truly frightening experience from beginning to end. The first time I saw the face of Regan, I nearly left the theater. Then my curiosity was piqued by images of ancient horrors. I am not squeamish when it comes to movies. I was ready for the vomit. But I guess I have to ask myself, ""How much can you put up with?"" I know I will never watch this movie again. Once is enough. Am I cheating myself. I don't think so. But it is quite an experience.",u
28,30 January 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,10, The Exorcist stands firmly among the greatest films ever made.,"The Exorcist is widely regarded to be the scariest movie of all time. Personally, I would put it a little differently. Instead of calling it the scariest movie of all time, I think that it would be more accurate to say that it's the best horror movie of all time. These may be just two different ways of saying the same thing, but I think that there is a notable difference. ",r
29,4 July 2007,kylekool150,10, The Godfather of Horror.,"The Exorcist is simply a masterpiece. Great Cinematography darkens the atmosphere and a superb screenplay enhances the dialog. There is plenty of excellent actors in this film as well. Loads of great performances from actors such as: Linda Blair, Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, Max von Sydow. I pressure you to see the re-edited one. Trust me, it's not a remake. It's a better editing of sound and picture, and even some NEW footage that is of the same quality.",v
30,29 October 2016,ironhorse_iv,9, Oh hell yeah! I finally got the Exorcist in my possession. This movie is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. What an excellent day for an exorcism.,"Without a doubt, 'the Exorcist' is one of most terrifying movie ever made. With a minimum of special effects, director William Friedkin and his small crew, including make-up artist, Dick Smith, art director, Bill Malley, cinematographer Owen Roizman and others, has made the existence of demons and the reality of possession into a realistic scary watch. It absolutely terrified theatre audiences when it came out, as some people went into convulsions, fainting or shock. It was even report, that a movie goer attacked the screen in an attempt to kill the demon and others got possession by it. Mass hysteria led to paramedics being called to some theatres, and others were picketed in protest but for me, even years after I saw this movie, I still have nightmares of the imagery, it use. It remains unparalleled in its ability to make the most confirmed atheist horrified by its depiction of primeval, mystic evil. It's really that compelling. Loosely based on a true-story of the possession of Roland Doe, and Assyrian and Babylonian mythology culture. The film and the best-selling novel of the same name by author William Peter Blatty in which it was adapted from, tells the story of Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair), a young daughter of a movie actress, Christie MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) whom started to develop very odd symptoms of sickness and increasingly aggressive and violent behavior. After not finding a rational explanation of the cause of the illness, Chris seek the help of two priests, Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) & Father Lankester Merrin (Max Von Sydow) to explore the possibility of an exorcism. Without spoiling the movie, too much, several versions of the film was released with different cuts, due to its controversial content. Some of them, were edited to cut out some of the more obscenely scenes like the notorious crucifix-masturbation scene, the spider-crawling moment and the bleeding Virgin Mary statue shot, others not. Instead, they added to it, inserting new or delete unused footage. Despite that, this film is still notable for being one of the biggest 'R' rating box-office successes of all time even with all the leftover controversial content, like depictions of desecrations, graphic gory self-mutilation, and crude harsh language. To get the best version, seek the 2010's 'The Exorcist' (Extended Director's Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) on Blu-ray version as it has everything to get through the film, including restored and remastered soundtrack, both with Mike Oldfield's unforgettable song 'Tubular Bells' and the three pieces from Lalo Schifrin's rejected score. Anyways, one thing, I didn't really like, how this movie is how much, Friedkin went to some extraordinary lengths to get realistic reactions. From what I heard, from the crew, he was a jerk to work with, often shooting guns and slapping his actors. He even went so far as to put Blair and Burstyn in harnesses and have crew members yank them violently, causing injuries like breaking Burstyn's coccyx, which led to permanent injury to her spine. Not cool! Not cool at all! Suspense was also heightened by tales of a cursed film set, whichexperienced mysterious fires, hospitalized, and even death. Even with that, I think the film deserve ever Oscar nomination, it got that year including Best Picture. All of the acting in it was great. Burstyn was amazing as the mother of Regan, showing not only a sense of fear, but her wiliness to take some real physical bumps. She really deserve the Best Actress nomination. For Blair, while she wasn't the one who did the voice of the demon as that was Mercedes McCambridge; she did help deliver the best performance with her body language. Her transformation to the evil demon, Pazuzu is stunning. The things, the filmmaker put her body, through were rough. Plus, due to death threats against Blair from religious zealots who believed the film ""glorified Satan"", Warner Bros. had bodyguards protecting her for six months after the film's release. That proves, that she deserve her nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars. Nevertheless, I still glad to hear that McCambridge got credit for her role as the demonic voice after not getting it, for a very long time. That legendary radio actress did a lot for this film. The way, she alter her vocalization by bounding herself, chain smoking and swallowing raw eggs, is crazy! Furthermore, the actress gave up sobriety as she knew alcohol would distort her voice even more, and create the crazed state of mind of the character. The extremes which the actress put herself through to gain authenticity—still haunts the director to this day. That legendary radio actress did a lot for this film. Miller's performance in this film is a little bit more, questionable since Friedkin really had to go extremes to get a required startled reaction from him. I really didn't think, he stood out, that much to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. From what I heard, the actor seem hard to work with, as he felt too disgust, and depress, while filming this movie. It shows in the footages, they use. Don't get me wrong, Miller isn't bad actor, but he wasn't great. If anything, Sydow's character is more memorable. I'm surprised, he wasn't nominated. However, I really didn't think the movie need, all of those scenes in Africa with his character as it expose too much of the backstory. It really felt like time wasting. It really took the movie, forever to get to the possession with all the establishment shots in Georgetown. The movie has really bad pacing issues. Also, I didn't like how Reagan started to feel ill, after playing with an Ouija board. It felt too clichés even in the 1970s. Even with that, overall, it still hold the benchmark for being one of the best horror films ever. It's still a must-watch.",
31,9 April 2023,Elvis-Del-Valle,10, A unique horror masterpiece that remains terrifying to date,"The Exorcist is a well-constructed horror movie in many aspects that make it a worthy movie of this genre. It has a well-developed script and a good production. Apart from the good performances, the effects that were very subtle, I also give points in favor for the soundtrack and its strange sounds that generate a gloomy atmosphere and that also includes editing and editing. Linda Blair also gets a lot of credit for acting and all that makeup that was very convincing. In conclusion, The Exorcist is one of the best horror movies and cinema in general that have been made due to its direction, production, etc. It's been said many times before, but it's because to this day, it's still creepy and still fresh, because it's unique because it has a kind of unique style that hasn't been seen in any other exorcism movie. For all that said, my final rating for this movie is a 10/10.",
32,31 October 2022,Jeremy_Urquhart,10, Lives up to the hype,"Unfortunately, my taste in horror movies is pretty vanilla, and that's made clear by my two all-time favourites from the genre. For both, I've been lucky enough to see them in a cinema during 2022, with the big screen and proper sound-system making them even better than I'd remembered. The first of those 5-star horror movies was 1980's The Shining, a few months back, and the second - seen tonight - was The Exorcist. It's not saying anything new to declare either as essentially perfect horror movies, but here we are. And what can I say - they've earned their stellar reputations.",
33,3 April 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9, Still Shocking After All These Years,"Few movies shocked people like this one when it came out. Almost 35 years later, it will still shock you if you've never seen it. It's definitely recommended, but beware of some very gross scenes, brutal language and a sordid and genuinely frightening story. ",
34,28 April 2006,Lady_Targaryen,9, The Devil Inside,"This is one of the scariest movies of all time. The first time I watched it, I was 12 years old and I was with some friends and with my brother. We all were pretty scared with this story of possession and horror of the poor girl named Regan Teresa MacNeil,specially because all the time they were showing the connections with demon's statues, figures and faces. Reading the trivia section, I can see that many things were quite spooky and hard even for the actors and actresses, like when they say that the '' Director William Friedkin went to some extraordinary lengths to abuse the cast. He fired off guns behind the actors to get the required startled effect. He was said to have slapped one actor across the face before rolling the camera. He even went as far as to put Linda Blair and Ellen Burstyn in harnesses and have crew members yank them violently.''",
35,15 September 2005,Jonny_Numb,7," cerebral, plausible, and compelling","There are certain scenes in ""The Exorcist"" that have a great power to them (the exorcism itself is a masterful set-piece) and others that are a bit shaky (including the drunk, unfunny director cracking Nazi jokes in the presence of a German butler); but overall, it is a film that mines genuine fear from a pervasive sense of vulnerability. In dealing with the possession of a young girl (Linda Blair) by an unseen, inexplicable force, we feel as if nothing is safe, therefore making the potential of horror that much greater. I suppose the story is probably the most familiar in the annals of horror at this point, but to recap: actress Chris MacNeil's (Ellen Burstyn) daughter, Regan (Blair) comes under the spell of a vile, vulgar demon (at one point implied to be the Devil itself), and when the most well-paid psychiatrists and doctors come up clueless, the Catholic ritual of exorcism is suggested. While the performances of Burstyn and Blair aren't revelatory (Chris often seems like an overly dramatic starlet in need of a Xanax, and Regan is confined to heavy make-up), the thread of plot dealing with Damien Karras (the Gabriel Byrne-ish Jason Miller), a priest who suffers the death of his mother and is afraid he's losing his faith, adds a believable, consequential depth to the tale--the visible doubt he conveys during the exorcism finale (alongside the brilliant Max von Sydow) makes the tension resonate on a higher level. ""The Exorcist"" is cerebral, plausible, and compelling...in my book, it may not be 'the scariest movie of all time,' but it unlocks an undeniably gripping fear.",

38,7 April 2012,wandereramor,10, One of the best horror movies ever made,"What's remarkable about The Exorcist, especially when you compare it to other horror films, is its patience.

39,27 April 2004,Tubular_Bell,10, Not scary: downright amazing.,"I was influenced into watching this film after maybe the 100th listen to Mike Oldfield's masterpiece ""Tubular Bells"" (the full, 48-minute album, not the 4-minute edit!), which was used in this movie's soundtrack. I wasn't exactly frightened or scared by the movie. I was expecting something gory and gruesome in this movie, but oh, was I wrong. And that's good, because I don't like movies that are gratuitously gory and gruesome. This movie is anything but gratuitous. I wasn't scared, but I was amazed and fascinated by the atmosphere, intelligent story and masterful filmmaking. It feels really genuine, and there are maybe 2 or 3 movies I have seen that felt genuine. It's a beautiful story about faith, and deals with the ""good vs. evil"" scheme in an unusual way.

While many people would most certainly list The Exorcist as THE scariest movie ever made, there seems to be a growing number of fans who find humor where it was not intended. I don't get it. Maybe it's a generational thing, but The Exorcist remains as effective today as it was in 1973. If the story of a young, helpless girl being turned into a snarling creature isn't horror enough, add to that the desecration of sacred religious symbols and you've got something quite shocking. Beyond the story, the strong performances by a good cast really help put The Exorcist over the top. Max von Sydow was never better. And the performance of an incredibly young and inexperienced Linda Blair is nothing short of remarkable.

You would think something like a demon invasion or exorcism would never happen to such happy, rich, normal and successful people.

Repeated duplication of the genre has, no doubt, 'desensitized' a new generation of movie-watchers, though it remains an unnerving masterpiece. It is not difficult to understand why the film generated such a seismic global impact all those years ago, since it imposed an unprecedented sensory attack on the viewer. Regan's vile physical appearance, combined with her vile language and blasphemous diatribe sent a shock wave around the world. Moreover, many people seemed to believe the claims that the film was based on a true story and could therefore actually happen to them. Electricity consumption must have soared for several months in 1973 as people who had seen the film slept with their lights on! It is still not a film I would feel comfortable watching before going to bed. On another level, I found parts of it profoundly moving and actually cried at the end when Regan was finally released from her possessor and wept in the arms of her mother and Father Damien, having lunged himself through a window and down a precipitous flight of steps, managed to find just enough life in himself to indicate that he had retained his faith and repented of his sins by motioning his fingers in the sign of penitence when comforted by a distraught colleague. Possibly the only thing that lets the film down if one really sits and thinks about it is the underpinning concept that an ancient demon which had existed since the dawn of time should wish to possess the body of a twelve year old child and emit a string of juvenile profanities. But then the film was designed to shock all along!",
56,3 November 2018,torrascotia,8, It gets better as you age.,"Everyone has watched the exorcist at some point and its so well know that franchises like Scary Movie have ripped it off so well that its difficult not to raise a smile when scenes which were lampooned show up in the first few mins of the exorcist. Or so I thought.
It doesnt take long for the creeping dread of this movie to make you forget Scary Movie ever existed.
Theres no real need to explain the plot as its so well know.
Having watched this when I was much younger what I recalled were the possession scenes and the exorcism itself, however that isnt where the magic lies.
What stands out re-watching this as an adult was the sinister and creepy build up towards the exorcism.
What seems to be forgotten is that in this movie the possession is never really confirmed until the final third of the movie, a host of psychiatrist use the crude science available at the time in order to try and explain away the behaviour of the possessed girl. Watching the mother try to come to terms with whats happening and the ordeal the girl experiences at the hands of the medics is also harrowing.
The reason this is regarded as one of the best movies ever made are the human relationships and trials as an adult which are tested by the devil. Its aim is to drive a wedge between families and exploit the guilt families may feel towards each other. It is also authentic and was aided in production by the church who ensured it treated the matter seriously.
Sure some of the effects may look dated but its still effective. Or it was when I watched it this halloween in a freezing, dusty and decaying cinema. The environment certainly added to atmosphere of the movie.
I have heard reviews that some younger audiences have found this funny and cannot take it seriously, I doubt that will be the case when they grow up and watch this with the eyes of an adult. Its much more than one of the best horrors, its one of the best movies ever made. Period.",

58,14 February 2010,Dr_Coulardeau,8, The devil in its Catholic superstition,"That film was a turning point in horror films, in a way. For sure it did not concern some kind of mythical being or character. It was centered on a real person, living next door or up the street. That's the really new element, and even so, there had been some antecedents. The second new element here is the strongly Catholic context, and it is not clear at all that the Catholic Church is not used as a justification, a stamp of truth posted on the film, in other words an alibi. I find that slightly embarrassing today for the Catholic Church and all Catholics in the world. Many Catholics consider that demons, and daemons, and so on along that line, are nothing but a pagan heritage in the Christian approach of the world. The last point is not new at all. It is the close association of these demons to something found in some archaeological site in North Iraq, in other words in Moslem territory. This can be seen today as an anti-Moslem bias and it is absolutely unacceptable. On that point, like on the previous one, the film has aged tremendously. Apart from that the film was well made and still is well made. The suspense and the progression of the plot are quite clear. We understand more or less that the demon takes possession of the younger exorcist and that this priest prefers killing himself to being possessed. There are though several points that remain unanswered and difficult to accept. Why did that demon take possession of a priest? Wasn't it more comfortable to be in a young girl? And how can the priest justify his suicide in any way? If God enables a demon to take possession of one of his priests, that priest has to wait for God to liberate him, and committing suicide is not that kind of a liberation. That's why I will classify this film among the films that played an important role when they came out and even accumulated some fame because of it, but that have today aged tremendously and lost most of their appeal.

The character development and story are so detailed and entertaining that the first half of the film left no dull scenes of dialogue. The latter half of The Exorcist was nothing short of amazing. Normally, the payoff scenes are shorter quick pieces of reel towards the end but The Exorcist had long drawn out Exorcism scenes with terrifying moments. All the actors and actresses themselves performed phenomenally. Linda Blair playing the most innocent girl to start really leaves a lasting impression when the voice of the demon comes out of her character.

61,24 August 2005,pete-546,10, Review of The Exorcist.,"For as long as I can recall, I've always possessed (no pun intended) an innate feeling that there exists outside the realm of our established dogma things that defy conventional logic. When I was in the sixth grade, I read the book, ""The Exorcist,"" which scared me senseless. The idea that the Devil could infiltrate the delicate core of one's being called a soul absolutely terrified me at such a young age. After seeing the movie, I was speechless. Have been ever since. William Friedkin's transformation of the book to the movie was superb, in my opinion. (Not all adaptations are.) Dick Smith's special effects, in contrast to today's make-up advancements in the film industry, are still able to stand the test of time. The acting was splendid, from Lee J. Cobb & Jason Miller, to Ellen Burstyn and Max von Sydow's limited appearance in the piece. Friedkin's slice-of-life direction enhances the essence of the fear-factor in an oddly subtle fashion, as though the viewer were actually alongside the characters in the film. Lending to the creepiness of the film is the fact that there exists a minimal musical score (Mike Oldfield's ""Tubular Bells"" does accompany two nuns strolling gingerly down a Georgetown street in autumn, their robes billowing slightly in the wind). The palpability of what happens to a young Linda Blair has astounded me for over three decades. Having been so taken with the notion that inhuman entities DO stalk the earth and have never existed in human form, I've written a couple of novels on the subject matter, myself. I liken the new version that had been released a few years ago to the last nail in the proverbial coffin of effectiveness, making this one of the best horror-genre films of all time. Simply put: I've never seen any film that remotely comes close to what this movie has done to me (in terms of frightening me senseless). Linda Blair's cute Regan MacNeil is utterly transformed into a beast which is flat-out disturbing to behold. The movie has moved me ever since I had seen it at age fourteen, and I suspect will always. Put simply, at age forty-three I still have a difficult time watching it on my own. Great job, Mr. Friedkin and crew!",
62,27 October 2022,VikingBurialService,9," A Fantastic Movie, which also Happens to be Horrifying","One of the best horror movies I've seen. Basically, a young girl gets possessed by a demon, and two priests have to exorcize her. To start with, the acting in this movie is basically perfect; Linda Blair (the child) has an incredible range for a 12-year-old, to be able to go from a sweet, smiling girl to this hateful, demon creature. Of course the voice isn't her own, but just her facial range is amazing. Each of the characters feels like a real, fleshed out person: the greek priest with a sick mother, the actress parent, the older priest who's an archeologist. Those backgrounds don't interfere with the movie, they just add to the real feeling. The scenery/lighting is good, particularly the choice of bluish/green lights in the bedroom during the exorcism - they give it a sickly, cold feeling. The music and sound constantly jumps from building volume to quiet moments, which helped keep me on edge during the movie. My only personal gripe with the movie was in the pacing; it took a long time for the posession/exorcism part to get going. Also the scenes that ""horrified"" audiences of the 70s (the vomit, the crucifix, etc) didn't bother me especially, but that's probably due to being desensitized by modern movies. Overall, a pure, well-made horror movie.",

The Exorcist, adapted from Blatty's novel tells of a young girl becoming possessed by a demon. Her mother cannot cope with her sudden change, and being a famous actress, stops at nothing to find out what is wrong with her daughter, employing scientists, doctors, psychiatrists etc. At first they claim her behaviour my be caused by a brain lesion, others think it may be drugs or simply the trauma of growing up in what they feel is an unstable environment. However, her behaviour goes beyond extreme and the doctors know the case is above their understanding. When a friend dies, a cop investigates. It is recommended that perhaps Regan should see a preacher. Chris Macneil tracks down Father Karras who has recently been having a crisis of faith.

Besides a number of religious allegories in Sweden with Ingmar Bergman, for English-speaking audiences he was Jesus in ""The Greatest Story Ever Told,"" an over-zealous missionary in ""Hawaii,"" and, on the other side of the spectrum, he was the devil in ""Needful Things."" Whichever side he's on, you know that Von Sydow will be the big boss man: his commanding presence and natural air of authority make it impossible to see him as an ""average Joe."" His Father Merritt is a reassuring figure: you know we're in good hands when he arrives at Regan (Linda Blair)'s bedside. This movie raises some interesting questions. Although it was made a quarter-century before pedophile priests became fodder for ""Oprah,"" I can't help wondering just what kind of problems Father Karras (Jason Miller) was dealing with as a psychiatrist to his fellow priests. Throughout the film there's a sense that something is amiss in the world . . . and in the Church. If a twelve-year old virgin can be possessed by the Devil, who is truly safe? Conversely, why should the Prince of Darkness invest all his powers in claiming the soul of a movie star's quite ordinary daughter when he could just as easily possess the President of the United States or the Premier of the Soviet Union? Nevertheless, this is a great movie with an air of moral seriousness that prevents it from being merely exploitative. It's hard to understand how Christians like Billy Graham could say the movie itself is evil when if anything it reaffirms Christian values without being as shrill as later examples of ""Catholic horror"" like ""The Omen.""

82,28 February 2023,njamesgentry,10, My Favorite Novel and Film,"The Exorcist is truly one of the greatest novels ever written, and one of the greatest films. It's scary, disturbing, but also beautiful. How far will a mother go to save her child? That's the key element. Chris is so desperate to help her daughter, and after a very disturbing and graphic moment involving a crucifix, is pushed to her last hope: Father Merrin and Father Karras. The novel, by William Peter Blatty, who also wrote the screenplay, delivers a powerful story about faith, love, doubt, and the ultimate battle between good and evil. You care for these characters; they're fully-developed people who you can relate to in one way or another. You want a happy ending, even though what's delivered is bittersweet. You don't have to be religious or spiritual to find The Exorcist scary and entertaining; it is simply brilliant, thanks in large part to the amazing cast. Even after 50 years, this movie is still just as fun and iconic, and of course disturbing! Do yourself a favor and read the 1971 novel as well. There are moments in the book that make the movie seem G-rated, especially in terms of that infamous crucifix scene. You've been warned! And despite those intense moments, you have to remember why it's so powerful. Chris is at her wits end and doesn't know who else to turn to for help. Her character isn't religious in any way, yet she's driven to contact the church as her last remaining hope. Regan's behavior becomes increasingly violent; her physical appearance has transformed from a sweet, apple-cheeked face to that of a monster. This is thrilling from beginning to end! It's still a perfect horror masterpiece.",

The editing was flawless helping to add to the overall content of the film. The sounds were amazing! The sound effects used during the ""demon"" scenes make the film believable.

This, combined with the extreme reactions on the part of the audiences must have really heightened the fear in the theater. I remember reports at the time of people leaving the theaters before the movie finished as well as the furor it caused because it was so scary. Well, tonight I watched in on my computer. Sure, I've got a huge computer screen, so it wasn't a claustrophobic experience but it sure wasn't like being in a theater. Keep this in mind--theater patrons probably were much more scared--especially because the film was extremely terrifying compared to anything previously seen--making ROSEMARY'S BABY look like a Disney film!

89,4 March 2005,jboothmillard,10, The Exorcist,"From Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Willaim Friedkin director (The French Connection, The Hunted, Killer Joe), based on the novel by William Peter Blatty, this is called ""the scariest movie of all time"", it is certainly one of the most talked about, and deservedly so. Basically in Georgetown, Washington D.C., actress Chris MacNeil (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ellen Burstyn) is filming her latest film, she is taking temporary resident in a large house, and she has her twelve year old Regan MacNeil (Oscar nominated, and Golden Globe winning and nominated Linda Blair) with her. Chris starts to notice changes in Regan's behaviour, slowly becoming stranger and frightening, including swearing and abnormal strength, medicine fails and hospital tests are negative which confuses doctors, they are not aware that she in fact possessed, due to an ancient Ouija board, by the spirit of Pazuzu. Chris's British film director Burke Dennings (Jack McGowran) is killed in mysterious circumstances, falling out of Regan's bedroom window, investigating a suspected murder is detective Lieutenant William Kinderman (12 Angry Men's Lee J. Cobb), he questions Chris, and also young priest and psychiatrist Father Damien Karras (Oscar nominated Jason Miller), who is losing his faith, and his elderly Greek mother eventually dies from illness. Following Regan assaulting a psychiatrist, the doctors conclude the only option to cure the girl is to have an exorcism, but Chris questions this as she and Regan have no religious beliefs, Karras agrees to see Regan, who has hideously changed facially, he refuses to perform an exorcism, but further terrifying supernatural phenomena force him to accept. Karras gets permission from the bishop, as long as an experienced priest assists him, archaeologist and priest Father Lankester Merrin (Golden Globe nominated Max Von Sydow) has recently returned from an archaeological dig in Norhtern Iraq, where he found evidence that Pazuzu, who he defeated many years ago, would return, he is called in to help. Karras and Merrin work together reciting from the Bible and splashing holy water in the hope of removing the demon from Regan, who is tied down to the bed, but the spirit taunts them, especially Karras knowing his weakened faith and guilt of his mother's death, he is dismissed during a break and told to wait outside while Merrin continues the second attempt. Karras returns to the room, and finds Regan free of her binds and Merrin dead on floor, in rage he attacks Regan and demands the demon to enter his body, Pazuzu does so and in a moment Karras throws himself out of the bedroom window, his friend Father Dyer (Reverend William O'Malley) gives him his last rites before he dies, days later Regan is back to normal and remembers nothing, the MacNeills leave for Los Angeles, and onlooking Kinderman walks with Father Dyer. Also starring Kitty Winn as Sharon, Titos Vandis as Karras' Uncle, Wallace Rooney as Bishop and Mercedes McCambridge as the Voice of the Demon. Burstyn is great as the distraught mother trying desperately to help her daughter, Sydow is great as the elderly priest and exorcist of the title, young Blair is brilliant as both the innocent girl and the demon claiming to be the Devil inside her, and the rasping voice of McCambridge is suitably evil sounding. Released at the cinemas this became the highest grossing scary movie, but there was also at the time reports of people fainting, walkouts and vomiting while watching, this has only added to it's reputation. The most memorable moments are the masturbation with the crucifix, the spider walk down the stairs (often cut out), the head spinning and the girl floating while the priests repeat the words ""the power of Christ compels you"". I admit the first time I saw this I found some of it funny, but the second time being uncut I respected it much more as a masterpiece, with it's fantastic makeup, special effects and sound effects, you could argue that over time the terror has lessened slightly when you watch, but no matter what it will always remain a quality horror film. It won the Oscars for Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for William Peter Blatty, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Sound Track, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Regan MacNeil was number 9 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 2 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, it was number 91 on The Ultimate, and it was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Films.

However, the story is quite silly. It is not so much a horror film as an exercise in gross effects, with pea soup playing a prominent role. In fact, some of Blair's antics are more comical than scary. The expository scenes are not very interesting, and the prologue in Iraq, while well filmed, does not fit in with the rest of the film. The plot has some holes, and even if one accepts the premise of possession, there is no logic to someone turning her head 360 degrees without dying. It's simply cheap thrills.",

This film, "" The Exorcist "" written by Peter Blatty, enter the hearts, minds and souls in 1973 with so many opinions, reviews and predictions that nearly every media outlet was flooded with them. Upon entering the modern theater in that time and place, gave everyone a unexplained sense of foreboding. Potential audiences were warned not to see the film alone. The story is based on the mounting and unexplained hysteria of the time called manifested phenomenon. In simpler terms it was called 'possession.' The idea that a beast, demon or satanic monster could posses the body of an innocent victim sent shivers through the spines of believers. In this story we have the Vatican calling on an expert in demonology, one, Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow). He is assisted by local priest, Father Karras (Jason Miller) who originally investigates the strange happenings. The investigation attracts the eye of the local police who send Lt. Kinderman (Lee J.

You will have to look elsewhere for comparisons; from what I understand, not all of the new is positive, however. I guess the big question that anyone who has not yet caught this is: Is it true? Meaning: Is this really the *scariest film ever*? And the answer must be ""it depends"". Because if you do not believe in what this depicts, and even worse, if you take this completely out of its chronological context(translation: If you don't consider that this was made in the early 70's, since some norms have changed since then), frankly, several of the things can inspire laughter rather than fear(!). And with that said... this is quite well-made, and for such a potentially sensationalistic subject, it respects cinematic language and contains proper, gradual build-up, as any well-told story does. The acting is great, including Blair's performance. Plot develops nicely throughout. The characters are credible and consistent. A scene or two just... stop, ending at an exciting time instead of resolving the conflict. The direction is effective, and Friedkin does what he can to terrify us, and no matter if you think it's real or not, most of it is unsettling, to say the least. Also, there is no doubt that this inspired later horror movies. There is a lot of strong and outright explicit language, as well as bloody violence and disturbing content in this.

As it so happens, Father Karras also specializes in psychiatry but what he discovers when he visits Regan horrifies him to his very soul. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is without a doubt the scariest horror film I have ever seen.

Some audiences start giggling during ""The Exorcist"" right about the time Linda Blair's bed starts shaking, an understandable response since the film's shocks are occasionally outlandish, and the possessed girl's mother curses as much as the demon! The film is intense (sometimes glumly or heavily so) and also very scary (battering the viewer with graphic obscenities), yet there is art in the way director William Friedkin shaped William Peter Blatty's story, and many scenes are now classics: a haunting shot of Regan's scarred face overlapping the arrival of Father Merrin; Regan being promised a nice day out on her birthday, instead overhearing her mom on the phone trying to contact the estranged father, telling the secretary, ""He doesn't give a s**t!"" ""The Exorcist"" is definitely a horror movie, but it's also a psychological suspense story; if viewers do laugh at the freaky moments, that's because the shocks are engineered mechanically--they provoke either fright or nervous laughter (and in a crowded movie-house, reactions can go either way). The extra scenes included on ""The Version You've Never Seen"" were long overdue, however they do not add nor detract from the original product (although I found the ""ghostly apparitions"" a distraction).

Thirty-seven years later, the sharp, vivid, fine resolution of the initial Iraqi scenes brings this aging but classic movie into the contemporary age with shots so visceral of great film-making that rivals the quality of even today's advances in film work. As time passes and the scary horror films keep piling up, most of the once classic shots from turning of heads and spitting of goo have transformed this horror movie into predictability, yet the shock value remains mostly because of how utterly graphic and degrading the dialogue and the devilish behavioral occurs in this movie, particularly in the middle portions of the movie. The judicial use of horror and strange where only about five brief odd occurrences are revealed in the first half-hour reveals how focused this movie is on the careful editing and balance of horror and drama and relational interactions that pervade this film. Perhaps only the color and texture of the goo is one of the few weaknesses of this movie. THE EXORCIST retains is strong elements of acting and drama. The first third of this movie is remarkable for its almost independent and prescient approach to photography and directing almost presaging the future of quality film-making - JARHEAD (2005) comes to mind.

Once every scientific and medical approach has been exhausted, the truly desperate mother turns to the priesthood - hoping maybe they can save the girl? It was certainly ground-breaking at the time: the fairly (though only occasional) graphic violence, the provocatively vile language - especially potent when it emanates from such young lips; the effective make up and green slime effects - they have all stood the test of time in away that many of it's contemporaries have struggled with. The pace is perfect (though I found the director's cut took way too long to become interesting, even if it did show us some of the beautiful treasures of Northern Iraq); there is a little well placed humour and the measured, almost stately contributions of Max von Sydow - always a master of the"" less is more"" style of performance - really work wonderfully, building to a culmination that has you on the edge of your seat. Lee J. Cobb also adds a certainly mysterious quality to the story, too - a policeman investigating the death of one of the characters from earlier on; but a man who seems to know a great deal more about what is actually going on than he ever leads anyone to believe.

Father Karras sacrifices himself in the end out of love. His doubts about his religious beliefs aside, the ending proves that the man hasn't lost his innate love of Humanity: he's willing to trade HIS life for the girl's. In a fright film as powerful as this one, that's one hell of an affirmation. The re-release, which contained the previously excised ""spider"" scene, was well worth seeing (though I still can't figure out why it was cut in the first place): it's hands down one of the scariest things I've ever seen; the sound effects alone were worth the price of admission. Unlike the re-edited versions of THE WARRIORS (in which Walter Hill totally ruins the break-neck pace of the movie) or THE OUTSIDERS (in which Copolla drowns out the drama with gratuitous music) or BLADE RUNNER (in seven re-edits of which Ridley Scott makes not one substantial change) or APOCALYPSE NOW (which was edited right the first time) or JAWS (in which Spielberg has Scheider as Brody idiotically saying ""Blow up!"" as the shark makes its final charge) or STAR WARS (in which George Lucas mistakenly thought that making Han Solo faster than a speeding bullet was a good idea- which completely undercut the character's character) or any one of a number of other ""re-dos,"" the restored version of THE EXORCIST IS worth a look.",

It's a solid film with intriguing characters and groundbreaking premise but it depends too much on only a few powerful and mesmerizing sequences instead of a being a coherent wholesome. The truly eerie images of a possessed 12-year-old girl cursing and mutilating herself are very shocking but the all the rest sadly isn't much more than a dramatic family portrait and a Catholic essay on evil. Don't get me wrong.I also regard this as an essential movie and one of the few films that co-formed the horror genre but I definitely think it's a slightly overrated. The story develops rather slowly and it lacks involvement. Once the ""Devil"" makes his entry, Friedkin and the cast take you for a wild ride of shocks, ahead-of-its-time brutality and unseen atmosphere but it finishes as abrupt as it started. Luckily, there's the class-A cast, of which all members bring extra depth to their characters. Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow are impressive but yet my vote for best actor here goes to Lee J. Cob who adds some welcome humor to the devastating substance. The young Linda Blair made herself immortal and she still is everybody's favorite head-tolling girl. The rude voice of Mercedes Cambridge (who dubbed the ""Pazuzu""-lines) only gives more impact to the image of evil. Anyway, no matter how sublime the soundtrack isno matter how strong the reputation is by nowThe Exorcist certainly is not the scariest movie ever. As far as I'm concerned, it isn't even the best tale handling about ""religious evil"" (check out ""The Omen"" for that).

So rooted in smart and frustrating realism, which Friedkin himself knew was essential for the film, and with considerable doubt and skepticism shared by all before it gets to the point of no return for Regan, it allows itself to become an extremely thorough movie as we're taken through all the processes in immense detail that Regan goes through in order to get to the titular exorcism. The exorcism itself is mainly scary in the way that the priests cannot lose energy before the exorcism is through and if it fails, the demon could grow stronger.

I saw the film at the cinema in 1998 and I enjoyed it but it hasn't dated too well. The special effects for their time may have been pretty good but nowadays, they wouldn't satisfy most audiences. What still works about ""The Exorcist,"" is the way it is written, directed and acted. It is in one sense, a good old fashioned story about Good vs Evil. Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow, Jason Miller and Linda Blair take the acting honours between them. The making of the film was just as eventful as anything that occurred in the film itself. About 9 people who were directly or indirectly associated with the film, met with sudden deaths. It makes one wonder if the film set was cursed! It was a long time in the making - over a year altogether but it was worth it. The screenplay is one of the best I have come across for a horror film.

Mercedes McCambridge is stunning as the voice of the Devil, and actually didn't receive proper credit for this until later. Regardless, it is a brilliant film by 1 of the greatest American directors, William Friedkin. Unfortunately, it was released the same year as ""The Godfather"" (1973), which swept the Academy Awards the following year. That is irrelevant to me.

Seeing Linda's Blair's head spin around and vomit some green muck was a little unnerving to see I guess, and there were a couple of other little moments, piths of unease you could say. This was when director Friedkin was making great films, yet there's no film I really hated of his, except may'be for The French Connection which I just found slow, where I just didn't sit out the battle. The film has a fantastic script, and brilliant story structure, where we sympathize with Blair's unhappiness, as Daddy's split and left her with her single Mum (Burston) a famous actress as in the story, which I liked. What I liked though here, was we really got to know the family, where sadly for Blair, despite her richly deserved Academy Award, he career sadly plummeted into B grade. Noticing changes in her daughter, matters become worse for Burston, when suddenly Blair becomes one of the possessed, where an evil spirit has taken over her body. A young reclusive priest (Jason Miller, who very much reminds me of Gabriel Byrne, even with the accent) is called into perform an exorcism, and flush the spirit out. Where finding other doctors have failed, and this is over his head, he sends for a master exorcist (Max Von Sydow) to try his hand at it, at ridding the evil in the possessed Blair. He's virtually the last hope, so the scene is set for quite an intense ride. What I liked too, was how we were taken into Miller's life in the priesthood and personal, where his Mum is very sick. Scary or not, I just love this movie, first seeing it back in 2001. It may stretch reality some, where we wanna believe it is possible and it may not be a terrifying ride for some, but what gives the movie it's buzz is as I said, the finely written script, and the lives within in the characters in it, something most horror films fail to do.",

There were some minor flaws in the movie. During the exorcism scene, the statue of Pazuzu appeared when Regan was kneeling on the bed.

The Exorcist is not a scary film(well at least to me) I believe the reason it is hailed as the scariest film of all time is because the generation that saw it in 1973 was a Catholic one.The concept of the film is very scary,movies about Hell all most all ways are.The film does have a lot of disturbing images(The split pea soup scene,Regan stabbing her private parts with a crucifix,and Karras' demise.The character development is great,both priests are somewhat flawed,Karras is loosing his faith,and Merrin has had heart problems since he performed his last Exorcism.The Direction is great too,how the house changes through the course of the film.I agree that the Exorcist is an excellent film,but not one to be scared of.",

We see the struggle in the characters themselves, their fears and their flaws, we see how much strength is needed to fight evil.

From being protested by the Catholic church to making people pass out in the cinema during its theatrical run, it's one of the godfathers of controversial horror. The difficulty with these kinds of films is that they run the risk of becoming comedic with age. Sometimes, as audience expectations and standards shift, the original experience of watching a movie like this with fresh 70's eyes will be lost forever. Also, many films since The Exorcist have in some way, re-used or payed homage to iconic elements of the movie. This too can make it hard to go back to the source material of all this praise and ripping-off; running the risk of being underwhelmed.",

Dark and moody in terms of photography, it accompanies perfectly its plot ( most of the time ). Also, the music is used smartly. The most haunting scene of this masterclass in suspence ( Friedkin had preveously done The French Connection ) is the scene where the possessed Reagan pees on the floor during her mother's party - the most scary is the descent of Reagan, in which she walks like a crab. Overall, this movie shows how to create viscerally an atmospere and a mood that are in tune with the psychology of Reagan, her mother and the priests.",

186,8 December 2017,justinmethe,7, A horror/drama with real meaning behind it.,"The main thing I really liked about this film was how different it was from many of today's horror films. It wasn't just your classic slaughter movie with the worst actors or just completely dumb characters who you almost want to route against, but instead was interesting with characters who actually had purpose in the movie other than to just be butchered. I would call this movie a horror but it may also be a drama as well. It takes a great look at what would actually happen if a young child were to become possessed in 1973, and I believe that's why so many people became so afraid of this movie or of the idea because of how realistically sounding this was. This movies impact reminds me a lot of like the movie JAWS. Once that movie came out and people heard if shark attacks being reported their was a mass hysteria which just added to the intensity of the movie and same with THE EXORCISM. The movie is one of the few horror movies where it actually has meaning and life to it instead of it just becoming a slaughter house halfway through.",

Characters and dialog are very real with nothing moving from the standard story until well into the film. Once the Green Pea soup hits the fan you suddenly realise why this was banned when it was, but I must point out that in the context of the story it never seems over the top, just very disturbing. Despite the re-release, it still seems like there are two gaping holes in the storyline, as though there are still some serious edits remaining. The acting is believable, Linda Blair is very convincing and Jason Miller portrays well a Priest with failing faith, a very good human portrayal. Very enjoyable and slightly unnerving, it almost lives up to its reputation.",
188,7 July 2008,the_cyberpunk,1, The Most Overrated Film Of All Time: The Exorcist,"Honestly, this was never a good film, it sucked in the 1970's when it was made, and it still sucks today when it is worshipped. How it ever passed for a good film is beyond me, but somehow millions of people still flock to screenings of this stinker while the Catholic Church continues to be outraged for some reason. The honest truth of this film is simple: it is not a great film, and it shouldn't be a controversial film. Its portrayal of the Church is if anything rational and progressive; ""What do you mean your little girl is possessed, what are you, stupid? This is the 20th century."" Face it people, the emperor is naked. There's barely anything passing itself off as a plot, just a series of sad, scary and sometimes silly scenarios that are largely unrelated to each other and a rather ridiculous premise when you actually examine it. Not to mention the lamest portrayal of a character in film history; that of the Devil. It is established that young and unfortunate little Regan is possessed not just by a demon, but (oooh insert scary music) the Devil himself . . . because she played with Ouija board . . . Right . . . Honestly, this is the best the Devil can do? His major forays into the world of mortals consist of puking green slime and making lewd remarks? When did the devil become little more than a drunken frat boy at a kegger? I mean sure when it's a little girl doing it, it's kind of odd, but throw a backwards hat on her and a baggy Lakers Jersey and she'd fit right in at the next Kappa Beta Gama pledge night. Why didn't he do something creative and take over the president and start a nuclear war, or take over a Georgia Prosecutor and then get her to leave law after a string of misconducts only to start her own lousy talk show? If I was Father Merrin I'd be relieved that this is the worst thing the Devil could come up with, pull up a chair next to the bed, throw on a Cheech and Chong movie and have some laughs, and then wonder if the reason Lucifer was actually cast out of heaven was for being obnoxious and lighting his own farts while everyone was trying to watch UFC.",

After numerous medical examinations come up with no explanation for her condition, Chris in desperation turns to exorcism and a Jesuit priest Damien Karras (Jason Miller) who is going through a crisis of faith, must determine if the child is in fact possessed and requires an exorcism. After learning about the case from Chris and avuncular police detective Lt. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) and after seeing Regan's head-whirling, crucifix- abusing, green vomit routines, he is convinced that inhabiting poor Regan's body is none other than the devil himself and calls in an elderly, experienced exorcist, Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow). The core of the movie is Regan's subsequent exorcism, so cold that plumes of frost expel with every breath and so rancid with terror that audiences even today tremble at the sight.",

Back in the theatre 27 years after the initial release, and everyone with any interest should spend the $7.00 and check this out the way it was meant to be seen.  This was William Friedkin's third consecutive, and last, great film (after ""Boys in the Band"" and ""French Connection"".  Anyone under 35 years old can't understand the controversy and impact of this film on its original release. The giggles and laughter in the theatres are typically from those movie-goers who historically jump and scream everytime some clown in a hockey mask reappears to hack someone to death. If this is not your first time, pay special attention to Jack Nitzche's musical score.  Nitzche, who died this year, composed music for some wonderful films including ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", ""Stand By Me"", ""Starman"", and ""The Hot Spot"" (one of personal favs).He had an uncanny ability to capture the essence of the film in his music.  Also admire Jason Miller's marvelously understated performance as Father Karras.  He is now known as Coach Ara Parseghian in ""Rudy"". It is also fun to watch for some ""set bloopers"" (items misplaced or moved between scenes).  A couple of tidbits from this one: the writer, William Peter Blatty also co-wrote ""A Shot in the Dark"", the first Inspector Clouseau flick; and the composer, Jack Nitzche also co-wrote the 60's hit ""Needles and Pins"".",

I don't think it's as scary, as it is disturbing, and absolutely brilliant. By that, I mean, a film that puts the ""fear"" of God back into the viewers. What other film could do that? The Exorcist is a triumph of special effects. The demon, Pazuzu, looks just as good in 1973 as it does now. It's a mystery why such brilliant practical effects were replaced with CGI. This film also takes you on a psychological ordeal. The line is blurred between reality and fiction, between faith and science, between lies and truths. You'll keep wondering if it's all just some kind of disease Regan has.. well, until the exorcism begins.. then it's pretty obvious. I loved this movie. It's a testament to the power of the cinema, and what it can do for people, for better or worse. People ran out of the movie theaters when the film was released, possibly traumatized.

There were reports of viewers fainting or vomiting in theatres when this was released in 1973, such were the reactions to scenes such as its young protagonist undergoing a realistic cerebral angiography and masturbating with a crucifix, and of course theres that head spinning showstopper.

Common sense tells us that even if we wouldn't watch rubbish like Saw, Hostel, Nightmare On Elm Street etc on a bet they have to contain gratuitous footage far more disturbing than anything Friedkin and Blatty could dream up 30 odd years ago. That out of the way it is still psychologically difficult to forget the hype whilst watching the movie. Of COURSE it has more depth than any dozen so-called 'horror' flicks of today put together plus well-drawn fully rounded characters so that essentially it is more a conventional drama with excessive behaviour than an out-and-out horror movie. For myself I could have used about three times the footage that Lee J. Cobb was allowed.

The Exorcist as we all know,literally,everyone,is considered one of the best films ever and I'm here to talk why. The Exorcist is not just about horror,but also about faith and how far you'd go to save a loved one. Linda Blair as the twelve year old Regan is also brilliant and considering this is her first role in a big motion picture after only having minor roles in two TV movies before this. Ellen Burstyn was also very good who actually made it as if it was actually real with her speechless scenes and her crying and her expression knowing something is horribly wrong,Max Von Sydow was also brilliant in this even though he only really appeared in the beginning and at the very end as well as Jason Miller who also made his role very real.

213,23 February 2009,HelloTexas11,9, Unforgettable,"Watching 'The Exorcist' today, one can safely say it has lost none of its essential power to haunt and terrify. I had only seen it once long ago and my memory proved a bit faulty. For instance, I was surprised how inconsequential Lee J. Cobb's role as Lt. Kinderman really is. And Max Von Sydow's part is shorter than I thought as well, though he has a pivotal part as the older priest, Merrin. The film really focuses on Ellen Burstyn's character (Chris McNeil), Linda Blair (Regan), and of course Jason Miller (Father Karras). Chris McNeil is not a particularly likable person, despite being a devoted mother. She is a spoiled, petulant actress who tends to throw hissy fits if she doesn't get her way. Yet she is the audience's surrogate in the film, a non-believer who ultimately, ironically becomes the most fervent advocate of having an exorcism performed on Regan. And to go off on a tangent for a moment, I believe one's reaction to the film is different depending on if you are Catholic, or were raised Catholic, because what is shown in 'The Exorcist' is pretty much every Catholic's worst nightmare. I can't say what someone else might think of it; perhaps it comes across as simply a very intense horror film. But for those brought up Catholic, I think it is doubly so. The damn previews scared me so bad, I wouldn't even see it when it came out. Father Karras is the center of the film, the doubting, tortured priest who ends up making the greatest sacrifice. Jason Miller is perfect in the role. Karras is too intelligent for his own good and yet when he sees what must be done, he proves his fears do not make him a coward. There is a telling moment when Chris asks him if Regan is going to die; he turns to her and without hesitation, says, ""No."" And poor Linda Blair is really run through the wringer. One can only imagine the rigors she was put through during the course of filming. But she is game, and though her part has been parodied endlessly in the years since, she acquits herself very well. A couple of shots do not hold up well, for instance, the infamous head-turning scene which now looks more phony than frightening, like a ventriloquist's doll. Most of the special effects though are excellent, as convincing today as they were 35 years ago. One of the most insidious and maddening scenes comes right at the end. The demon inside Regan has killed Father Merrin, which Karras discovers when he re-enters the bedroom. As he tries to revive the old priest, Regan sits on a corner of the bed and begins giggling, as though she has just torn up her best friend's diary or something similarly trivial. Karras goes almost insane with anger, throws her to the ground and begins punching her as hard as he can. It is a powerful scene, unforgettable... as is the whole movie.",

Right off the bat, I want to say that the acting in this film is amazing. The whole cast does a great job, but Linda Blair's performance as Regan, the possessed daughter, is phenomenal. Seeing her being able to act like an everyday girl and then begin to contort her body and shriek while the demon is possessing her was awesome. The special effects are also top notch and feel ahead of their time. Having the bed float was a highlight for me, and in the same scene the subtle flash where Regan is replaced by the actual demon was really cool. It's so quick that you can miss it easily so catching it makes it feel all the more satisfying, and simultaneously disturbing. The story, being as far fetched as it is, is completely believable, and it takes good writing and direction to pull that off. The characters are human and I really enjoyed seeing Father Karras' battle with his wavering faith. That all being said, some of the acts that Regan does while possessed come off as being more goofy than scary. I understand it's an older film, but it's hard to look past some of the things that happen. It just looks weird and over the top sometimes, and I don't think they were going for that vibe. It kind of ruins more serious scenes when you've got the two priests performing the exorcism and reciting prayers, and then you've got a child flicking her tongue everywhere and moaning. It took me out of it a couple times which was unfortunate because it usually happened when I was just really getting back into it. It's by no means a deal breaker, but it's worth noting. I found it interesting how much content in films had evolved since the fall of the Hays Code. In the span of only a couple years we went from isolating films that dared to include a word such as ""shit;"" effectively making it tank from lack of exposure, to having it be totally fine to depict a twelve-year-old dropping the f-bomb every other sentence. It's just mind boggling how quickly the industry made that transition. And that's not even mentioning how graphic this film is on a visual standpoint. In any case, I greatly enjoyed The Exorcist, despite occasionally noticing it's age. It's a solid film and I can see why everyone's trying to copy it nowadays. It's just too bad no one's achieved it's level of greatness yet.",

Adapted by William Peter Blatty from his controversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is racked by satanic dis figuration.

The Exorcist helped re-define the modern horror moovie from the psychological angle, and sports some of the moost famous, disturbing, and downright disgusting scenes ever put to film.  Ellen Burstyn stars as Chris McNeil, an actrees in DC who'se daughter, Ragen (Linda Blair, in her only good performance ever) just may be host to a demon named Legion - or is she just schitzophrenic??  Max Von Sydow, in a glorious performance, leads the team of priests, each with a past, to take on the demon.  There is a darkness to this film that few other films have ever even come close to capturing, and the intelligent, captivating screenplay is superbly handled by Director Friedkin & his cast. Friedkin previously directed The French Connection, but then all but vanished, except for a couple of little-seen, unknown moovies.  There are sooo many excellent scenes in this film, the MooCow has difficulty selecting just one, but perhaps the scene where Fr. Karras get the tape-recorded voices translated - mooocho creepy.

Horror film that revolutionized the gender and caused great polemic.Director William Friedkin transformed the William Peter Blatty's story in a powerful and frightening visual show about possession and salvation, and changed the conception of how to construct a really scary movie.At the time ""The Exorcist"" was filmed, horror flicks were in frank decadence and reduced to Frankenstein and Dracula's films, but Friedkin made the difference with this memorable motion picture and i believe that after Friedkin ,the only movie maker who reached such quality of fear and tension was Clive Barker with ""Hellraiser"". If ""The Exorcist"" is in some moments dramatic, in others violent, ""Hellraiser"" is a psychological thriller with almost unbearable cruelty ,and as Friedkin, Barker also could count with a terrific cast, beginning with the great and talented english actress Clare Higgins. Good part of ""The Exorcist"" quality resides in the cast's dramatic and true actings (to begin with young Linda Blair,who was nominated by the Academy for her role) and to the great special effects, that even have been done through simple and old techniques, surprise and help to show the exorcism's  scenes in a faithful and raw form.""The Exorcist"" is not a film recommended for sensitive people.

Why it stands apart? I think because it treats its subject and characters with utmost sincerity and care. All characters ranging from the possessed girl, the helpless mother, the saviour priests and even the demon himself have been sketched with high level of detailing and given the back stories so that you care for them. Scenes involving demon torturing the possessed girl are terrifying and leaves you haunted. The conversations between devil and the priest are delicious to listen. The movie talks about possession and exorcism in so much detail as if you are watching documentary on this subject. Acting by all lead actors is top notch. The movie requires your patience in first half an hour but then there is no letting back as unpredictability takes center stage and you are glued to the screen to know how it will end. Movie succeeds in ending the horror in satisfactory manner. For all horror movie lovers, don't miss it!!",

240,7 December 2016,paulyboy-62474,10, Even as a kid I knew this was a great film.,This film is interesting in every way to me. The acting is on point and the movie feels like it is based on a true story....is it?? I love how the movie starts off with a quick intro like modern movies and all the credits are at the end. The risks the film takes when it comes to what an exorcism would actually be like is why this film is so great. I love how innocent Regan and even Capt Howdy seem in the beginning. I also love how people were being institutionalized (in the 70s) over this film. It is a shocker but I feel that generation had never seen anything like until then. I think the effects of the cold air coming from the possessed girl and the twisting of her neck really were some of the scarier parts. The bed shaking and the horrible things she says just added to this film greatness. It blazed a path with a simple main theme that was just plain creepy. Great film to watch and watch again.,
241,1 May 2015,fatfil-414-451797,10, Not just a horror movie.,"Since watching this movie for the first time in around 1976, I have held it up as my No.1 movie of all time, and have never wavered from that opinion. I have watched it many times since, and it never fails to , I don't know, Shock? Thrill? Scare? None of those adjectives do it justice. It affected me, and still does, at a basic, almost primal level. Melodramatic perhaps, but that's how I feel. I probably came across it at the right time, an impressionable 14 year old, having just read Stephen King's Carrie. Then the movie being banned made it even more alluring. One of the movies big strengths is the depth of character background it goes into. Almost half the movie deals with the build up to the actual possession. Father Merrin's middle east archeology, Karras' mother and his wavering faith. After over 40 years, the movie has dated some, mostly from a fashion perspective, but this never detracts from the story. The only thing that stops me from giving the movie a 10, is the feeling that the middle section of the film, Regan's transition from an innocent little girl to a fully possessed host seems rushed, when it should have been more gradual. Going through the battery of hospital and psychiatric tests just seems like a nod to trying conventional means to explain Regan's condition.I know there are time restrictions etc. but that is my only, minor criticism. A must watch movie, and not only a horror movie, BUT, the greatest horror movie of all time.",
242,6 May 2008,I_Love_Spielberg,10, (2008) A Disturbing and Disgusting film (2012) One of the scariest movies of all time,"""This movie is about a 12-year-old girl who gets possessed by the devil or some kind of demon. According to critics and audiences around the globe, this is one of the scariest movies they've seen. And it's gotten a lot of attention and went through the roof at the box office. This is my opinion: It's probably one of the worst horror movies I've seen in my entire life. It wasn't even scary. It was just disturbing and disgusting. I, like the rest of my family, didn't like it that they exposed Linda Blair to all of that stuff when she was twelve years old. She didn't even know what all of that meant at the time. I'm actually trying to block this movie out of my memory entirely. It disgusts me to even thing about it. Personally, I think that they should either have taken all of that stuff out, gotten someone else, or not even made the movie at all. I mean, it's a good story and a good script, but it just didn't serve up the scares like everyone said it would. Now, don't get me wrong, the scene where she spider-walked down the stairs was pretty intense and the scenes where you see her eye turn white and her head spin around were pretty intense as well, but all in all it's just another downer. I will never see this movie again as long as I live nor will I recommend it to anyone unless they enjoy watching 12-year-old girls do horrible things that I won't even list here.""",
243,4 May 2015,williambendavis-933-218958,8, Amazing horror film that easily stands up today,"This is an exceptionally made movie. I got to see it theaters too, which only made it better. The film might be a tad slow in the beginning, but it picks up quickly once Reagan gets possessed and starts doing weird things. During the scenes where Reagan is flipping out, the special effects are incredible, especially for the time. They'll have things flying across the room, the entire bed shaking furiously, and of course, the projectile vomit. All of those look extremely realistic and they add to the super creepy atmosphere this film has. The voice they gave the possessed Reagan is perfect. If I had to choose a voice for the devil, it would have been that one. It really gets to you and makes every scene that has it way more frightening. The movie does have issues though. In the very beginning, they have this backstory about this little sculpture of the devil being found and I found it to be both unnecessary and kind of confusing. It isn't really clear if the devil got released because of that statue or what. I couldn't find a correlation between that statue and Regan either. Only other problem I have is the devil being very picky about how he uses his power. I don't understand why he just didn't break the straps and leave. I know they tried to explain it, but it doesn't really make any sense. Damien Karrass asked him that and he responded with ""that would be a display of too much power"" or something like that. He says that, yet he'll throw stuff all over the place and throw up on people, and even kill people. How is breaking some straps too much power? I call bs on that explanation. Other than those 2 problems, fantastic horror movie.",

Not only is its subject matter terrifying to contemplate but its happening to a 12 year old girl, a pure innocent caught in the crossfire between good and evil. The Exorcist takes every element available to it and weaponises it to strike terror into the hearts of its audience, lighting, sound and composition all turned against the viewer to create a surreal and monstrous experience.

As a child my mother wouldn't let me watch this movie, I was a preteen but, when I became an adult I felt like I knew why she didn't want me to see it. I was scared of horror movies but, still wanted to watch them.

That's just murder I call justified by some unbelievable monster hollywood made to get your bucks. Real horror is the unknown that creepy, eerie, feeling you can't explain, eventhough you see it, you know it's from the devil and evil, that's real horror!!!!! This movie delivers that feel !!!!!
Also, speaking of the setting and the overall feel of this movie. It is unsettling, demonic, scary, believable, Satanic, witch crafty, partly biblical. The acting is excellent, great cast, but, one thing I never liked about this movie it doesn't tell the truth about demon possession it makes the Audience believe imo, that Catholic's are the only one's that can cast out a demon, according to the bible I read, I know for a fact this is untrue but other than that, this is the most terrifying horror movie of all times and still is no one has topped it imo, as of yet, trust me, I've seen a large amount of horror movies and this one always gets 10 stars and more from me !!!!!!",

Then suddenly things start to turn for the worst. Things go downhill and eventually leads to Regan being possessed by Pazuzu, a demon lord. This is where the movie is seen as the scariest movie ever, her actions, language, everything was just shocking to people at the time since no movie before it had done things this way. I read that people were hauled away in ambulances from the theaters because of how shocking it was. When I saw this movie, even in 2007 I was surprised by her actions.

258,13 June 2022,julieshotmail,8, The epitome of an American girl rapidly turning into monstrosity,"Forty-nine years after its release, I watch ""The Exorcist"" in its entirety for the first time. Yes, I have seen the exorcism bedroom snippets before so I am familiar with the tone of the movie. The biggest impression left on me is the frustration, confusion, and helplessness suffered by the mother, who watches her daughter devolve from being an innocent, happy, wholesome girl into something unspeakable, despite of all of her expensive efforts spanning multiple fields of medicine, psychiatry, law enforcement, witchcraft, and the Catholic Church. The special effects, language, and violence are showcased to scare you, but the true horror lies in the mother's aching surrender. Unspoiled by social media and countless CGI, 1973 is a pure time to experience something new, and this movie delivers at the time with its groundbreaking entrance into the genre, becoming the masterpiece standard for horror movies. The production values are top notch; the buildup is indeed slow but eerie. I do knock off a couple of points for some cringe overacting from both moms. Other than that, this movie is a worthwhile watch mostly as a historical lesson in movie-making.",

275,7 November 2013,myspecialparadise,8, Interestingly Vulgar,"The year was 1973 ... the place Montreal, Quebec ... and the news was filled with talks about the newest horror film to hit the theaters ... The Exorcist! According to the news, due to health concern of theater goers, the theater had an ambulance stationed outside just in case anyone in the audience fainted, or had a heart attack, due to this being the scariest movie ever made ... and due to the public's reactions to the film during its premiere showing. The camera shows the ambulance sitting quietly in front of the theater, and the enormously long line of people waiting to get in to see the movie! We're talking a line that went clear around the block and ended about 12 feet in front of the line's beginning! How absolutely exciting! Fortunately, the movie was in English ... or was in fortunate, I still haven't decided. Anyhoots, the movie began with boredom that slowly evolved into ... how to put this ... SCREAMS of laughter! The scariest movie of all time was turned into a comedy, probably due to many of those in the audience not understanding a word of English! When the movie finally ended, and people were leaving the theater, those still standing in line to get in must have been totally confused by the comments of the people coming out of the theater ... due to the vulgar quotations and the screams of laughter. The No. 1 scariest movie was a comedy hit! Well, yesterday I found a copy of the movie at WalMart, for $ 4.00, and took it home. I wanted to see if it was as funny now, as it was in 1973. My opinion is that this movie became so famous due to the shocking vulgarity, and its disgusting sexual antics. It was pure shock! As for the acting. Linda Blair lost the chance at an Oscar nod due to the academy discovering that there was voice dubbings and mechanics involved in her performances. The real acting came from Ellen Burstyn and, in part, from Jason Miller. Ms. Burstyn was a perfect choice for her part, as were the rest of the cast, but Ms. Burstyn made the most of her part and made it her own! A scene that was not shown in theaters shows Regan coming down the stairs upside-down ... with a torso that was far too long to be hers! I'm not surprised that scene was originally tossed out ... however, it does add to the strangeness, as well as to the hilarity, of the film.",
276,5 October 2013,tao902,1, One of the worst movies of all time.,"A weak story that relies heavily on special effects and shock to hold the viewers' attention. For a film to be regarded as 'great' it needs: i) a story that gives us depth of character, ii) strong motivation for the lead character/s iii) themes that lie at the heart of the viewers' values iv) film techniques that draw us in to the story v) believability within the context of the film's story The Exorcist has none of these elements. It has achieved its fame through manufactured controversy (often thanks to religious zealots) and the use of 'horror' just for the sake of it rather than for a purpose. For examples of horror that works consider The Cabinet of Dr, Caligari, the original Frankenstein and Dracula, Don't Look Now, Rosemary's Baby, all of which draw the viewer into caring about the characters, empathising with them, questioning the antagonist's motives, allowing us to enter the world of the film rather than stopping us at the screen by reminding us of the filmic process through special effects and inappropriate spectacular visuals. Even the low budget, simple Blair Witch Project provides horror through enabling us to imagine being in a similar situation. Even the comedic Scream provides some occasions of horror through scenarios we can briefly relate to. But The Exorcist? No, it provides none of this. It's a third rate, unpleasant, unimaginative film lacking any subtlety and ends up abusing the medium of film. Tao902.",

A kid playing a demon possessed child is unheard of, and yet she does it with so much passion so much accuracy. And she portrays the demon so convincingly. Her Co stars are equally impressive, from the two priests, her mother and the detective. All so convincing that they provide a sense of reality. The screenplay and writing of this film are also mind blowing. And who can forget tubular bells? Everything about this film down to the cinematography is spectacular. No suprise this was nominated for so many oscars and won best picture on top of others.

279,16 October 2000,Brogan,10, Good fighting the ultimate evil.,"**SPOILER ALERT** Two years ago, I was fortunate to see THE EXORCIST on the big screen at the Warner Bros. 75th Anniversary film festival. And watching it on the big screen made me change my opinion of the movie from weird to excellent.  I first saw EXORCIST when I was nine on late night television.  I couldn't make any sense of it, and I though it was very bizarre.  I saw it a few years later on video and thought it was so-so. But watching this on the big screen really makes a impact of the film.  And now, we are lucky to see THE EXORCIST on the big screen, and it is the uncut version. In case you never heard or saw THE EXORCIST, this is based on the popular novel by William Peter Blatty.  Blatty loosely based his story on a factual incident of a real exorcism during the 1940's.  Exorcism became a thing of the past since modern science discovered various mental illnesses including split personalities and insanity.  In the film famous film actress, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is noticing that day after day, her twelve year old daughter, Regan (Linda Blair) is acting more bizarre and scary.  From using constant profanities to even hitting her mother and doctors.  After going to several different doctors, Chris seeks the help from Father Karras (Jason Miller).  Father Karras is having problems of his own, he questions his own faith after being guilty over his mother's death in a mental institution.  When Father Karras discovers the horrors of the deamon that has taken over Regan's body he wishes to use a exorcism, a ancient ritual where a priest or rabbi drive the evil spirit out of a person's body.  But since Karras is inexperienced, he gets the help from the distinguished and experienced Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow).  While a police detective, Lieutenant Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) is investigating the murder of film director Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran). The original EXORCIST I think is one of the most frightening and scariest movies of all time.  Although it's not about a shark in water (which scares me the most) this is about a evil that lives amongst us.  Some people don't believe this, others strongly do.  This is a film that is different and better than the slasher flicks that are being released by the dozens. I am here to review the new and uncut version of the film, so here is what I enjoyed and didn't enjoy with the new version. LIKED:  I enjoyed the new digital transfer, it was excellent!  I kept jumping as I heard the voice of the demon from behind me in the theater. It's rare that I can recognize the new digital transfer with classic being rereleased and digitally transferred. I also enjoyed some of the deleted scenes that were shown.  I found the best to be the first examination of Regan, where later on the doctor reveals to Chris that her daughter was using strong profanity towards him.  Unlike the original version where the terror just jumps out, it creeps up in this version.  I also enjoyed the more visions of the demon and the nice quiet dialogue scene where Father Merrin and Karras are discussing the evil they are up against.  DISLIKED:  I did enjoy the visions of the demon, but on the windows?  And the doors?  It looks more comical that scary when I see those. Unless director William Fredkin and writer/producer William Peter Blatty can come up with a good reason on why they did that, I won't accept it. But the biggest flaw is the end,  I am one who always enjoys a director's cut, THE ABYSS, ALIENS, and even the STAR WARS films redone were fantastic. But the final scene in the film where Lt. Kinderman and Father Dyer (Reverand William O'Malley) are talking about movies, takes away the errie and suspense of the original.  Where the original suddenly ended with the Jack Nitzsche ""Tublar Bells"" being played then...BOOM the credits.  It ends in a terrifying and creepy note.  But with this new ending, it's almost like a ""happy ending"" a ending that modern movie goers would enjoy.  I am a person that would always say, ""more is better.""  But with this version, it ruins the film. This is a movie that I would find to be very scary.  It would be a great film to watch on Halloween night.  But what upset me while watching this film are the rude people who would laugh and find this movie to be funny.  Why?  What's so funny about a young girl spitting up pea soup?  I would be horrified and disgusted.  But the people who laugh at this film, are the kind that find a stupid teenager wearing a white hollow mask carrying a knife around killing teens, to be scary.  These imbeciles are the ones who find THE SIXTH SENSE to be ""stupid"" EVENT HORIZON to be ""weird"" but find SCREAM as ""the bomb"" and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID... as ""freaky.""  You can point the fingers at those who ruined the terror of THE EXORCIST.  I'll point my finger at the Hollywood director's who do countless rip-offs and spoofs of EXORCIST (Leslie Nielsen's REPOSSESSED and ABBY come to mind).  Also, EXORCIST, after twenty-seven years is still getting ripped off with END OF DAYS, STIGMATA, and most recently LOST SOULS.  And the violence shown on t.v. news shows and programs just to get raitings.  If I told a majority of teens that the EXORCIST has been banned in the U.K. until two years ago, they would think that I am kidding, but I'm not. Like JAWS, STAR WARS, PSYCHO, and any other modern classic movie, if a plot works, other Hollywood studios try the same thing to cash in on the popularity.  By doing this, it causes the film's impact to die, and become cliched.  I can see THE MATRIX, SIXTH SENSE, and AMERICAN BEAUTY to be the next set of films with countless rip-offs.  It's a shame, what did really kill THE EXORCIST, why Hollywood, of course! But anyways, this is a film that is a must see!  See it on the big screen instead of blowing 3 bucks at the video store to think it's cheeper. That's like going to your swimming pool to go fishing, since it's closer and cheeper. Just go see this in the theater, and Halloween night would be the perfect night! 1973 VERSION: *****    2000 VERSION: ****1/2 (out of five)",

The real day-to-day feel of the movie (i.e. we're not in outer space or something) only feeds the fear.  If you're a religious person, or were brought up Catholic, there are definite religious overtones that can definitely get under your skin (the quick shot of the defiled Virgin Mary really got under mine).  The visual effects are stunning and repulsive, but what I noticed this time around (again) is how important the sound track is in setting the horrifying mood of the movie.  Got to see the DVD 25th anniversary edition, which has some extra scenes (I know it has a second subliminal vision of the scary-as-hell face of one the demon).

There is simply no second place movie in the horror genre that even comes close to this ultimate classic. The Omen?, Rosemary's Baby? The Amityville Horror? the Blair Witch Project? The Exorcism of Emily Rose? Psycho? The Rite? Not even the sequels Exorcist II, III, Exorcist The Beginning 2004 hold up to the original. There is nothing currently even close in second place!!! I have often thought how modern computer technology in 2011 could improve the 1973 classic. Other than inserting additional subliminal images, it might be close to impossible to improve on what was depicted in the 1973 movie for the following reason: What an audience member saw in the 1973 movie ACTUALLY HAPPENED. William Peter Blatty and William Friedkin physically created what the audience saw. It would be difficult to improve on reality. I admit, the head spinning 360 degrees might be improved upon slightly.

285,30 January 2011,andy-933-696608,9, The Excorcist Movie Review,"A horror flick you can actually call scary. It entails both religious themes, as well natural psychological focus in order to evoke reaction from viewers, making it a truly horrific display of demonic forces. Linda Blair, only a 12 year old actress plays dual roles, playing the innocent and soon to be the vessel of the very demon who she becomes. He claims to be the devil, when all he proves in the eyes of the doubtful Father Karras (Miller) that he is in fact a demon. To shine over the light of confusion on viewers, the Demons name is Pazuzu. This all becomes clear in the very odd, but still silently suspenseful introduction, as Father Merrin's discovery of certain artifacts points into the direction of that very monsters arrival. The discovery of a few small little statues resembling the beast, thus leading him to the very statue resembling Pazuzu. He probably knew it, but could not act enough to find him. His only option seemed to be to rely on the patience of waiting, hoping that in time he'd once again face this demon. In the time it took for the Exorcist to prepare, the demon preyed well, poisoning the mind as well as the very actions of his latest victim, Regan MacNeil. Regan, a sweet 12 year old, with little possibility of any evil lurking with in, has astonished her mother Chris (Burstyn), time and time again in the wake of this new persona. The awkward silence, blasphemes towards others, and the powerfully vibrating bed all pointing to various medical explanations. Doctors call it a lesion, a Psychiatrist will call it a spilt personality, others will simply call it an overreaction to her depression towards her absent father. A very desperate mother seeks answer after answer, only to feel more doubt, and less hope as she finds failure in every option given to her. In desperation and own reluctance towards locking her child up, Chris turns to exorcism, begging for the help of Father Karras, a priest/shrink who's own faith has been going down the drain slowly in the wake of his own losses. At first the Father doubts this persona to be demonic, only to learn more of this monsters true clarification as he witnesses the supernatural aspects of Regan's tormentor. Green vomit, a chilling room brought on by the demon's very presence, and a talent of various languages. The film's title character the Exorcist arrives upon the wake of his presence, giving believers and non believers out there a showdown worth shouting, ""Holy Mother of God"". Father Merrin, having experience in this very ritual, as well as being personally known by the demon, lashes every religious weapon lethal to the creature. A combination of holy water and uninterrupted prayers drive the demon to feeling excruciating pain, giving the hope that the very power of Christ can compel this so called devil, and save this servant of God. Alas that is not our end, because everything in life comes with sacrifices surprising both the good and the bad. Regan's life is spared, but at the cost of a sickly old man, and priest who's faith is further restored as he takes her curse, only to end it all in his own suicide, dying with both dignity and with the hope of forgiveness for his own trespasses. ""The Exorcist"" can be called many things, inspiring, horrifying, disgusting, disrespectful, and even maybe contradicting, however what makes it genuine is the very authenticity of its characters. As well as the haunting tone of it's direction, particularly in it's lead character Chris, as the mother of a girl who has become all but a complete stranger in her eyes, as she witnesses the demonic possession of her young child. I have to say though, by the performance of Linda Blair, I was both shocked and impressed at how she could just revert from the very innocence and charm that defines Regan, and then reverting to the very impure persona that defines the Satan wannabe demon. What makes the movie itself different from most horror flicks is, that it focuses it's inspiration of horror on the religious elements of God and demonic possession. It isn't afraid to show viewers just how impure the demon towards challenging the idea of God and his eternal love for us all, thus having the conclusion serve as both an inspiration of Gods own mysteriously sacred will towards the forces of evil. This film can also be considered a test for it's viewers in the lessons of comparing the concepts of actual demonic possession, and medically explainable psychiatry, giving us the chance to not only tell them apart with our own instincts, but with also our own belief in the forces outside science.",

It's very slow and boring. The editing is a mess. The main actresses are good, when they are not onscreen together. There, the chemistry is non existent. You don't believe for a second they are a mother and her daughter. I had the perfect idea of watching the longer version. And I'm dying, but in the meantime, I wonder how the normal one is, as some of the scenes seem to have been cut short. Of course there are lots of shocking moments, but they mostly look like postproduction's additions. As they were clearly meant to push boundaries. The climax is somehow worth the wait, even if it's to give us a couple of good laughs. But all I got from this movie, is how its reputation preceded itself. And how well marketed it was. Even the infamous theme song, still gives me the impression of belonging to another movie. You know, the cult classic. The one people say, is the scariest movie of all time... And I doubt they're talking about the barbaric practices at the hospital.

By the time I came around, the film had already been around a couple of decades, but each time it is introduced to a new generation it becomes brand new all over again. I remember that sinking feeling, deep down in my soul, when I realized what was going on in the film. I can never remember being that petrified by any other film before it, or since. I can watch that film today and still get that same feeling I got when I was seven-years-old. No one person can claim all the credit due to how creepy this film is. The voices, noises, and dialogue are a major part. Also, the completely terrifyingly realistic make-up and effects are possible more important.

It is my opinion that The Exorcist IS the greatest horror movie of all time, bar none, taking into account the year in which it was released and the social response at that time. Nowadays, the shock factor is gone. Our senses have been dulled by the constant flow of lame so-called horror films that promise so much but fail to deliver. When you consider that this little movie emerged from relative obscurity in 1973 at a time when people were a lot more fearful of religion than they are now, and when you look at the horrific imagery and blasphemous dialogue that was hurled at the unsuspecting cinema audiences, it is little wonder that some of their stomach contents made an even earlier exit than they did!",

1. This doesn't use CGI or jump scares to affect your fear. It doesn't need to. By building up a very unknown and alien evil that we never truly see, your imagination will take care of that. What are the beings inside Ragen? who are the ""us"" referred to by the creature? Why does it get to boss around the others? Why do they feel it's fun to torture a little girl and kill priests. You don't need to be Catholic to be creeped out and deeply affected.
2. We can all empathize. Like The Fly, being taken over by an alien force that over powers us, is familiar to a teen in love all as it is to someone diagnosed with a disease. It's never easy, always uncomfortable and you'll never be the same after. And, we get to visualize the effects, in real time as Ragen transforms into the grotesque corporel representation of that foreign agency, which no one can control.
3. Plays on our fears of the unknown in the thereafter. Where do we go after death? Are there ghosts and demons? Is what we do in this world relevant in another? These are deep questions raised by this horror movie...
4. The visuals, sounds, score and language in almost ever scene is creepy, deep and/or dark. There's human pain, fear, triumph, redemption, empathy jealousy etc.. all raw emotions that move and control people. All this erases any thought of comedy or lightness that's built in to the horror genre.
5. The Devil is portrayed in its darkest form here.",

It's far scarier than most modern horror movies; it's not the ""yikes!"" type of horror, it's just disturbing and even reaches introspective levels.

The writers of the ""Malleus Maleficarum"" (Hammer of Witches, 1486) and the likes of Martin Luther and John Calvin probably would have approved of both the book and the resulting movie, the Exorcist. It is the classic tale of good versus evil with the power of the Christian religion battling the forces of the Devil, right in line with many-an evangelical preacher currently propagating the ""Word of God"".

325,4 August 2007,matheusmarchetti,10, Stands the test of time,"This is one of the few films, specially horror films, that have stood the test of time, being as frightening, groundbreaking and thought provoking as it was back in the day. Director William Friedkin relies on creating an unsettling sense of dread, that grows to the point of becoming suffocating, as the film progresses, and it's approach of a documentary film-making style adds to the film's authenticity and 'spookiness'. Still, it's not only about scaring the audience out of their wits, as it is just as great as a truly heartbreaking character driven drama, and it shows, thanks to William Peter Blatty's amazing screenplay, based on his own novel. As a matter of fact, I find the lead characters' struggle with their own inner demons much more effective than the infamous exorcism/possession sequences. Linda Blair, barely 14 years old when she made this, gives a jawdropping performance in the role of Regan MacNeil, the possessed pre-teen girl that would become an icon of the genre. It's a shame she didn't have a very succsseful career, because judging from this film alone, she could've really been a terrific actress. Ellen Burstyn is tremendous as the child's mother, and is probably the most interestnig character in the film along with Father Karras, exquisitely played by Jason Miller. We also have Ingmar Bergman's star Max von Sydow, who despite being the title character, has small screen time, but as always, gives a haunting, memorable performance. Overall, one of the genre's definite classics, that surely deserves it's praise. 10/10",

Despite the sensational details of the film, it's laborious, and the characterizations and details in the first half of the film are not particularly necessary. The script seems truncated and leaves many things unexplained and Lee J. Cobb's detective serves no real purpose. For me, the most disturbing scenes were those involving the rigorous and invasive medical tests that the doctors put Regan through, and the film's single most impressive effect is the make up job on Max Von Sydow, a most convincing job of aging. Ellen Burstyn, a powerful performer, is effectively shrill and over the top, and Linda Blair's performance as Regan is a triumph of make up, dubbing and special effects. Unlike Hitchcock, Polanski or DePalma, Freidken takes his horror seriously; the film is heavy-going; humorless and shallow, and you don't feel for Regan or her mother, so the movie basically operates on the level of a carnival freak show.",

334,23 September 2000,jhaggardjr,10, The greatest horror film ever made,"I never got a chance to see ""The Exorcist"" when it first came out in 1973. But how could I. I was only 2 years old when the film first hit theaters and broke box office records. The first time I saw this movie was on cable about 10 years after its release and I found it to be one of the most terrifying movies that I've ever seen. I have seen it more times on video and I even went out and bought a copy of the film. ""The Exorcist"" is one of my favorite movies of all time, and a couple of years ago I made a wish that someday the movie would get rereleased back in theaters so that I could go see it on the big screen. Well, my wish came true on September 22, 2000. This was the date that ""The Exorcist"" returned to theaters. However this time the movie is being called in the ads ""The Version You've Never Seen"". The new additions to this version of ""The Exorcist"" include 11 minutes of restored footage not seen in the original 1973 version, and new digitally restored sound and music. And the result, the movie is better than ever. ""The Exorcist"" is without a doubt the best horror movie ever made. This movie is so powerful that I still keep thinking about it. But what makes the movie so memorable now is the experience of seeing it on the big screen in a packed movie theater. Yes, the theater I saw it in was filled. ""The Exorcist"" will be adding several million dollars to its already $165 million gross and deservedly so. What is ""The Exorcist"" about? I'm sure everybody knows this question by now. It's about a movie actress who goes through an absolute nightmare when her 12-year-old daughter becomes possessed by the Devil, and two priests who attempt to drive the demon out of the poor girl. Since I'm sure everybody knows what happens during the course of this film, I won't say anymore. But I'll comment on the new additions to the film. I don't think the new footage hurts the film at all. The much talked about ""spiderwalk"" scene is especially creepy and to me was quite shocking. It reminded me of the first time I saw ""The Exorcist"" and all the shocks and scares it gave me upon seeing it with all of its disturbing images. The sound effects have been upped a notch, and it's very effective. Plus, the additional music gives the movie more tension. I very much welcome the new additions to ""The Exorcist"". As for everything else in the movie, it's perfect. The performances by Ellen Burstyn as the actress Chris MacNeil, Linda Blair as her possessed daughter Regan, Jason Miller as the troubled Father Karras, Max Von Sydow as Father Merrin (the exorcist), Kitty Winn as Chris' secretary Sharon, Lee J. Cobb as Lt. Kinderman, and Jack McGowran as Burke (the ill-fated director of Chris' movie) give brilliant, outstanding performances. I've rarely seen a horror film with so many good roles. This is thanks in part to William Friedkin's direction and William Peter Blatty's Oscar-winning screenplay (based on his novel). WHAT A JOB! All the technical aspects of the film are splendid. From the excellent cinematography to the fast-paced editing to the eerie music score to the scary sound effects to the freaky special effects, everything about this movie is great. ""The Exorcist"" is literally one scary ride of a motion picture that still has the power to frighten the hell out of us. A masterpiece of terror that's brilliantly told.",

After seeing it I can say that it's definitely more disgusting than it is scary, containing some of the most disturbing images I have ever seen (and believe me, it's really really hard to show ME something that'll throw me off line!!!!!)I'm talking about the scene where the mother looks at the stairs and sees her demon-possessed daughter speeding(crawling) down them on her hands and feet. Or the one where she's ""offering"" herself to her mother, jumping up and down the bed. But apart from that the movie's merely disgusting(the barfing, masturbating). It is definitely one of the most influential horror movies ever made(now there's something new) ,has a good story(something most modern horror movies seriously lack!!!) and imagining I would watch it in a theater in 73 I'd probably be scared as hell. Even today, a couple of hours after watching it I can honestly say that some things will never be the same. It's probably the hype surrounding the movie that made it what it is today, but nontheless it's a movie every movie lover should see. Although, sadly it has been shamelessly copied in numerous movies, like ""Stigmata"", where Gabryel Byrne's character is a twin copy of Max von Sydow's father Merrin. But the question that really bugs me is what kind of parents would let their child have anything to do with this kind of movie. And I came to the conclusion that Linda Blair was probably an orphan. I mean she had to be, or she had some irresponsible parents. I can't imagine what an experience like that does to a kid. DAMN!!!! A movie that after almost 30 years still does the trick. 7/10",

For this movie portrays a struggle which brings out self-doubt and renders the characters utterly helpless in the face of a force so overwhelming and malevolent that the protagonists are literally thrown against the wall. A little girl is possessed ... or is she? The situation tests the characters' faith and belief in powers beyond the ability of science to detect, accept or control.

348,9 September 2017,FilmsFillMyHoles,10, My initial thoughts after watching The Exorcist (for the first time ever),"I think The Exorcist is the most realistic horror film I've ever seen. Though, this is both a compliment and a detriment to the movie. The blend of grounded drama and true horror is done superbly, the acting is just flawless all around, Ellen Burstyn gave one of the best performances I've ever seen on film, along with Jason Miller and last, but definitely not least, what Linda Blair did as just a child actor is simply unbelievable. The Exorcist is well-deservedly a horror classic, one of the best horror films ever made, it's a great film, but I had two huge problems with it. The editing and most importantly the way it was shot, the cinematography. There were many editing choices that I did not agree with, keeping some of the more mundane scenes running for too long and cutting some amazing and truly scary scenes painfully short. While this bothered me, I absolutely hated the fact that the cinematography is just so impossibly bland. There's no style or edge to it, despite the last 30 minutes of the film, which is cinematic perfection and a horror masterpiece there's absolutely no atmosphere to the film, which unfortunately made the extremely well developed dramatic scenes and the first hour of the film borderline boring. Still to end on a high note as time goes by I'm sure I'll appreciate the good sides of the film more, because the good is just excellent, but for now I'm a little frustrated by these two minor things, because they did take away a lot of enjoyment out of the film for me.",

I liked how in the beginning they give you a sense that an evil presence had entered the house, but they don't actually show anything until Reagan gets possessed.

⚪
All in all, this infamous William Peter Blatty novel adaptation levitates right under the ceiling and above all other titles of its genre, because, let's face it, it's undeniably one of the finest horror films that have ever been unleashed on the audience, as it slowly but constantly induces its heavy and bloodcurdling terror that is defined by its grotesque themes, outrageous atmosphere, the performance of Linda Blair as the possessed child and the effects, that make it a chilling and utterly terrifying masterpiece that deservedly turns heads and owns the title of being the scariest movie of all time.
⚪
The twenty-fourth day of this season is one of the highlights I have been looking forward to for a very long time. Believe it or not, this has actually been the first time ever that I have watched it, simply because I have always been told several things that scared the hell out of me and discouraged me to give it a spin. But now, after having taken my courage in both hands, I dared to finally experience the film considered to be the scariest movie of all time, and, honestly, I have had a blast. Yeah, I know, here is yet another young dude who declares this film to be a masterpiece, but by all that is right and fair, this film deserves every bit of praise it has received in the almost fifty years it exists. It is astonishing to know that this film was produced in the early seventies, because despite its age, the film hasn't lost any of its intensity and unsettles in the same manner as back in the day. I might not be able to judge what impact it has had then, but after hearing that people reportedly fainted during screenings, other threw up all the time and women even allegedly miscarried, I knew that it was scandalous. After researching even more, I even found out the Catholic church in fact boycotted the production and young actress Linda Blair received death threats from believers that accused her of worshiping Satan. Isn't that crazy? I mean, what was the last time a film caused a similar uproar? What is what makes this film so scandalous? Well, as a matter of fact, it is nothing but a novel adaptation of the book written by William Peter Blatty. However, it is reported that the events depicted in the notorious story are in fact based on true events the Catholic church denies to this day. There are countless legends that revolve around this phenomenon, and that makes it already dreadful before you have actually seen it. Honestly, what the film shows doesn't make this feeling any better. Admittedly, I haven't read the novel this time, but considering that the author himself adapted the screenplay himself, I think that most of it stayed the same and true to the source material. And as a horror film, it works wonderfully. Against my own expectations, though, it wasn't the nonstop terror I thought it would be, instead it was something completely unforeseen but undeniably effective. The film spends a lot of time introducing us to the characters and exploring the situation, before it unleashes its evil forces. As a consequence, we have relatable characters that I actually cared for. Next to Ellen Burstyn as the mother of the little Regan that is later on possessed by the demon, we have Jason Miller as the faithless and somewhat troubled priest, and by the time the exorcism is performed, they are perfectly developed. Even if the film doesn't offer the uninterrupted terror I thought it would cause, it nevertheless creates this constant, unadulterated feeling of genuine fear and dread. To be honest, the way it becomes increasingly more distressing is way better than that. This authentic feeling of helplessness that accompanies the characters and viewers likewise is utterly nerve-racking, and, from my point of view, unreached to this day. To this point I have praised the film so much, and I haven't even talked about the best aspects about it. It wouldn't be as terrifying as it is, if it wasn't for the indescribably horrifying practical effects by Marcel Vercoutere (and his uncredited assistant Rick Baker) and the downright gross make-up by maestro Dick Smith. It looks so terribly realistic and, honestly, runs rings around almost every modern production. Frankly, you'd almost think that this fourteen-year-old girl is possessed for real. What contributes the most to this effect is undeniably the performance of Linda Blair as Regan. As wonderful as future ""Requiem For A Dream"" superstar Ellen Burstyn is as the worried mother or as impressively as Max von Sydow and Jason Miller portray their roles as the titular clergyman and his colleague, she indisputably dominates every single scene she appears in. Father Merrin's entrance scene is an iconic shot that graces almost every cover, but the focus lies on the possessed child. From the eerie spider walk scene to the gross vomiting sequence, she is mesmerising. Honestly, aside from the fact that I was constantly terrified by her, I was strangely amused by her as well, because what teenage girl uses such a rough language and sounds like a chainsmoker and whiskey fancier at the same time? Her macabre behaviour is what shocks extremely and made people back in the day faint, probably. The final sequence when they perform the exorcism, is the magnificent climax of what has happened, and while some might dislike it, I think Father Karras sacrificing himself for the well-being of the girl is the perfect ending of his character. In the end, this film is one of those titles you heard are considered masterpieces, and even if this doesn't happen quite often, I got to agree unconditionally in this case. The cinematography, the atmosphere, the editing, the effects, the acting - everything is perfect. And it even teaches us a lesson, something that Ronnie Radke has made even more clear with one of his songs: don't mess with Ouija boards.",
360,7 October 2000,WalterFrith,10, Friedkin's redemption?,"I recently saw the re-issue of 'The Exorcist' with about 12 minutes of new footage, a re-mixed sound track and a print cleaned up for today and it looks as fresh as the day it was released.  It is by far the best horror film ever made and a thought provoking essay on the supernatural with religious overtones that paved the way for many of today's horror films. The new footage is a redemption for director William Friedkin.  I don't understand why he didn't use this new footage originally in the 1973 version.  Perhaps Friedkin thought it would be too literal in the point he was trying to make.  My only criticism is the ending which WAS better in the original version but the other footage definitely belongs here and with its recent box office success I hope we can look forward to other older films being released in the near future.",

I'm sure that, at the time, it was a mould-breaking horror. Now it's just a relic that illustrates the sensibilities of a seventies audience and the censors.

Yes, Regan was creepy when she was possessed but if you ask me the blood looked really fake and it was obvious what was real and what wasn't. Having said that I know the film was made in the 70's and there wasn't as much effects as there are today but I still thought it had the desired effect.

Nothing like it had ever been made before, or since. The essential element in this movie is it could happen to you. That stays in the back of your mind throughout the movie. A non-religious family, divorced parents, a newly single working mom, and a naive pre-teen daughter. The movie weaves a web in your mind. How could something like this happen? A innocent girl playing with a Ouija Board because she had nothing better to do, and her mother was hardly around due to her busy career. There is a disconnection in their relationship. Perhaps the divorce of her parents left her emotionally vulnerable... and Regan is a very vulnerable character. The characters are more connected than they know. There is an underlying plot that it was a trap for Father Merrin. How the possession began, the mother went to a priest for help, and he was an acquaintance of Father Merrin. Perhaps he knew it would come back into his life, and was waiting. Nothing is explained, but you can guess this demon and the priest have met before. What made it so amazing is they did not hold back. It's not the book version because that would be too outrageous even today. An NC-17 rating to say the least.

383,14 March 2022,pkshyguy-81949,10, Disturbing yet fascinating,"As a kid, I've always been disturbed by the concept of demon possession. The idea that a powerful entity could take over your body to cause harm to those around you and you couldn't do anything to stop it always sounded terrifying to me. While I've become more skeptical to supernatural phenomenon as I got older and thus don't retain those fears, I can't deny that William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"" captures this type of horror in a way that feels almost nostalgic to me despite me not watching it until recently. Everything from the solid practical effects that still hold up well nearly half a century later to Linda Blair's believable and disturbed acting makes this a more intense and thrilling horror than most of what I've seen in the medium. While I can't say it recaptured this fear in a way that kept me up at night after watching the movie, I found it to be a fascinating look into letting your mind wander and questioning: what if I just lost all control to something beyond my understanding? Maybe this is a lot of extraneous analysis for a movie that has a basic plot outline of ""girl gets possessed, priest exorcises scary demon from her,"" but I loved the portrayal of the entity in this movie as something that we humans don't understand all that much. Even if the demon's origins get explained later in the film, its overall nature leaves enough questions that it never really loses that sense of the unknown that made the horror so effective in the first place. This lasting impression is really was separates alright horror from great horror and puts ""The Exorcist"" up with the all-time greats like ""The Shining"" and ""The Thing.""",

When she started masterbating with the cross, I think I said ""holy crap"" out loud. The special effects were good. It seemed a bit slow at times and I really didn't quite grasp the opening desert scene, but fairly solid movie. Not a fan of tragic or unexplained endings, and this one had both, but still a good movie and would recommend it to anyone else having a fright night of their own.",

Whatever the reason may be, the fact is I don't think that this film is nearly as good as it's reputation would tell you. It is certainly a well-made film, all the actors involved are great, the effects aren't bad, and Friedkin directs the film superbly. I especially enjoyed the hidden ""faces"" that show up in numerous scenes. Is it scary? Not as far as I'm concerned it isn't. Perhaps a devout Catholic would think differently, but I wasn't frightened in the least. I don't believe in these occurrences, and that takes away any scare factor that there may have been, unless you're afraid of projectile vomit. Though the actors work well with what they have, the characters are all very flat. Very few of them are fleshed out, which is a shame. For a much better experience, read the book.

398,10 February 1999,MovieFan983,10, A classic!,"The Exorcist is a brilliant horror classic, from bestselling author William Peter Blatty, who scripted. The movie stars Linda Blair as a young girl, who is possessed by the devil. Her mother who's an actress, doesn't find this out, till she finds her bed shaking and moving by herself. Then after awhile, she becomes looking almost like a demon. Her mother, enlists the help of a young priest, who tries to talk to Regan (Blair) and get the demon out of her. Instead she also terroizes him, driving all of them out of her bedroom. They live in an apartment, to which has become legendary now, and the demon is trying to make Regan do stuff she doesn't, hurt even kill people. The pea-soup regurgitation scene is the best, and has become a memorable and famous scene, of the whole horror genre. The voice over is done by Mercedes McCaimbridge (extremely creepy), and some spectacular make-up effects. The acting, is also very well-done, with an extremely well-acted role by young Blair. Everyone else in the film, also does a great job. Although this isn't a movie for everyone because of the whole possessing thing, I do think, everyone who even if they don't like horror will like this. I must say, I was impressed with this film, even dealing with the Devil, you won't be offended or anything. The ending finale, is very intense, as is the whole entire movie, which will keep your stomach in knots from beginning to end. See it it's a classic. A 10.

The problem, as usual is the script, its not well written, much of the dialogue is about very little. The pacing of the film is unendurably slow.

Miller shows us a very human and struggling priest,full of the desire to believe yet held back by his own inner demons. He was appropriately honored with an Oscar nod for this performance.

She gives one of the finest child performances. When she is supposed to be innocent she can be compared to bunnies even. When she has to go crazy god damn does she go crazy. The cinematography is excellent capturing the dark atmosphere perfectly. Therec is also some of the finest uses of make up ever when Regan gets fully possessed.

I'm not a religious man but I can understand how certain scenes may not be welcomed by some of those that are.

""The Exorcist"" lacks the thrilling subtlety and possible coincidence of ""Omen,"" which is both a key strength and a notable shortcoming. It is a strength because it allows for a more visceral reaction to the violent images as they unfold, but it can also detract from the plausibility of the film if, as I do, the viewer subscribes to a non-Judeo-Christian faith.

A presentation worthy of the novel that inspired it, The Exorcist has been referred to by my colleagues as the scariest movie they've ever seen. I concur.

424,10 January 2010,brandon_lee420,10, The best horror movie of all time!,"For quite a few years I have been an avid horror fan and my passion for the genre will never die. Horror is mainly viewed by teenagers and men with a love for scares and horror always triumphs over fellow genres. Women tend to get scared while watching horror movies and that's why they prefer watching ""Romance"". Horror has it all: action, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, etc. but it is better than all other genres. Movies like The Ring, Grudge, Psycho, Scream, and Poltergeist, never have scared me while The Exorcist made me cr*p in my pants. Who would've thought that an 1980s movie could scare you. I certainly expected it to be a low-budget horror movie without any scares but I was wrong. In 1980s the graphics and make up can't compare with what we have today but The Exorcist didn't need lots of money or good makeup because it offered more than any other horror movie so far (2010). The story is intense and pretty terrifying but that's whats good about this movie. In the first two minutes it was all boring but then it reaches its potential and always achieve higher than it should and for that we are blessed to have great directors. The performances by Max Von Sydow is excellent along with Lee J. Cobb and Ellen Burstyn but the real show catcher is that sweet little girl who gets possessed by the devil himself, and that lady is Linda Blair. She really gave it her best from the point to where she was human to when she gets possessed. Her devil act really had me shaking and screaming as she talked with a voice full of horror and dread. She has achieved a great career in film industry so far. The Christian theme will have some religious people p*ssed of and so be cautious when you are watching The Exorcist. Strange thing is that the novel is somewhat scarier than the film.",

426,1 November 2020,christopher-underwood,9, I seem to have finally made my peace with this film,"I seem to have finally made my peace with this film after being far less enthusiastic than; seemingly everybody else, upon its initial release and rather underwhelmed by the 'Director's Cut'. I have recently found Friedkin's Killer Joe, To Live and Die in LA and The Sorcerer only okay but The Night They Raided Minskey's and Cruising fairly exceptional so it was with trepidation this was selected as our 'Halloween film'. I think the director is rather too full of himself and inclined to be a little over serious about his work and inclined to put a little too much emphasis into consideration of the effect he might achieve rather than giving his all to the work in hand. Nevertheless this is undoubtedly a great achievement and if nobody seems quite as appalled as I when we see Linda Blair's transformation into the bile spewing devil child, it may be the viewing of too many Italian gialli films that has led me to expect full on hysteria. Not sure I would be quite as sanguine though particularly with those awful sounds in the loft but never mind, for the most part this is beautifully constructed for full effect. I was particularly impressed with the archaeological dig scenes at the start and the general pacing with fine cinematography. Ellen Burstin is fine although a more demonstrative performance might have helped, although she gets a bit excited now and again, she does seem to take it all fairly well. Max von Sydow adds much needed grandeur and perhaps he could have had a larger part in the proceedings. An amazing performance is attained from Linda Blair and as I have seen her particularly praised for her performance in the much derided follow up, just might sneak a look at that.",
427,15 December 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, The devil made her do it.,"Often hailed as one of the scariest movies ever made, 'The Exorcist (1973)' is still effective to this day. It's an ahead-of-its-time horror (and not just because it doesn't have proper opening titles) that focuses on the violent demonic possession of a young girl and her mother's efforts to help her using both scientific and spiritual means. The film isn't afraid to get nasty when it needs to (a scene involving a crucifix is particularly disconcerting), but it's never overtly gory or sensational just for the sake of it. Thanks to some simple yet effective character work early on, you care about its characters and squirm in your seat when you see them put through the wringer. This is especially true of the possessed girl herself, whose steady decline into an almost rotting demonic vessel is actually somewhat upsetting. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that the piece involves an exorcism, which is protracted and intense and every bit as edge-of-your-seat as you'd hope. It's a fantastic finale to a really engrossing experience. Perhaps the only real oddity in the affair is the inclusion of a detective character who, despite being a relatively entertaining screen presence, doesn't really do anything all that significant. Still, this doesn't dampen the picture's overall affect. It's engaging, inventive and knows exactly what it's doing. 8/10",

Instead, he relies on the special effect, makeup and stunt departments to reify Regan's physical transmutation (that spider-walk ambulation!) and voice alteration (the possessed Regan's demonic utterance is from a fire-breathing Mercedes McCambridge), so that audience can feel the fright simultaneously with a giggling frisson, which also signifies a solid cast is a requisite.""",

The pan shot was very common in this film too. Other shots used include tracking shot and low and high angle shots. But the most important of them all is the over the shoulder shot. This was by far the most noticeable shot, as anytime something important happens or is about to happen, there is an over the shoulder shot. There was a good amount of zooming in and out, and because this is such a dark and intense film, jump cuts were used to lessen the stress and give the viewer a bit of a break from the evilness of the devil. The acting in this film was superb, and the cast did a great job in making this film come to life.

440,15 September 2008,UnholyOne,10, The Exorcist - A personal perspective.,"I was eight years old when The Exorcist came out. The stories in the playground started almost immediately, about parents throwing up in the cinema or of ambulances being called out to distraught patrons every night. I was into horror films already thanks to Hammer and Universal. My bedroom walls were adorned with pictures and posters of Cushing, Karloff and Lee and my younger sister was too scared to ever venture into my bedroom. So, of course, I wanted to see The Exorcist desperately. I read about it at every opportunity in magazines such as World Of Horror or Monster Mag. But in those pre-video/DVD years I had to wait until I was old enough. When I was sixteen I had a friend a few years older than me, Jim. He was an adopted orphan after his parents were killed in a car crash and paraplegic, paralysed from the waist down after a pole vaulting accident when he was thirteen. He had seen The Exorcist and told me it didn't live up to the hype and was 'nothing special'. Eventually, when Exorcist 2:The Heretic came out it was being shown close to me in a double bill with The Exorcist. After much perseverance I eventually persuaded Jim to accompany me to see it. For some reason they showed Exorcist 2 first and I started to fear the worst, was this any indication of what the Exorcist was like? I needn't have worried. The Exorcist blew me away and when my friend and I emerged from the cinema, into the cold night, he eventually admitted to me that the real reason he didn't want to see it again was because it had terrified him that much that he hadn't slept for weeks. I felt guilty for dragging him to see it again. Years later we watched it again on video for old times sake. Not long after this Jim committed suicide with no warning or indication. I miss him and every time I watch The Exorcist I think of him. So apart from being one of the best films ever made it also holds a special place in my heart.",

This movie had a strong impact on me when I saw it many years ago, and I can still watch it with great reward today. The sad thing is that you realize how hard it would be to make a movie like this within the Hollywood system today, where the chills and thrills should be presented in full force from beginning to end, leaving no room for ambiguity and character development. Friedkins choice of a documentary approach to the material works brilliantly, and the deliberate pacing, the orchestration of the buildup to the horrific scenes, is masterful, as is the subtle use of music and sound effects. Something that should be studied by all serious moviemakers working today. It´s sad that Friedkin´s made a lot of unspectacular movies after this one, but I guess he has had a hard time working within a Hollywood system in which the standards of storytelling has gradually been lowered.",

What Jaws does for swimming at the beach and The Blair Witch Project does for camping in the woods, this movie does for, er, being a twelve year old girl and minding your own business. Actually, all stupid jokes aside, that is one of the things that sets this film apart from most other horror films.  In most horror movies, it seems the threat is mostly avoidable.  For example, Jaws: just stay the hell out of the water; BWP: TS for you if you can't follow a friggin' creek out of the woods; etc.  But in Exorcist, the girl and her mother do nothing that we can see to incur the terror that comes to plague them and could have done nothing to prevent it.  It just happened.  Of course, one has to believe that this kind of thing can happen in reality for the film to have maximum impact (and there is, at least, a basis in reality).  But, for my money, even if you believe demonic possession to be so much hokum, this film does a good job at being creepy anyway; it's just that well made.",

Boys' things, which I strongly advise against, although they happen when boys pressure their friends to show their courage. At the time, of course, I was super scared. More recently and a lot older, I saw the movie again and found that age has caused its damage. When it was released, the film quickly became a hit and made crowds rush to the movie theaters and then run in fear. Today, however, its difficult to have this impact, although it remains intense. Its an exceptional film, made with attention to the smallest details. It bases itself very lightly on a real case of demonic possession, starting from that basis for an engaging and strong fiction story. The tension is permanent and the several visually and sonorously shocking scenes are what most contribute to make it truly scary. The transformation of that girl (played brilliantly by Linda Blair, in the single decent film work of her life) is horrendous and the exorcism sequence are really hard, despite almost no resemblance to a real Catholic exorcism. Ellen Burstyn (Regan's mother) was excellent and Max von Sydow did one of the greatest works of his career, as did Jason Miller (both in the role of priests). The film is enormous and terrible from start to finish and is strongly discouraged for all minors and anyone impressionable or very religious.",

Still, I just went into this apparently quintessential horror classic of classics, which I knew had deeply influenced pop-culture and the way people look at the horror film forever, with a fair man's mindset expecting at least something solid. What we get here is the most predictable story and development, with no discernible subtlety or particularity - just the most bland version you could POSSIBLY think up reading this review right now knowing however little you know this moment. The dullest, least dynamic, flat overdose of vivid and boring obviousness in all its early 70's splendor. This film was obviously a complete hoax. It just knew it had something big: a (for the time) graphic depiction of a possessed girl, the satanic/possession theme, with a film studio trick or two (the upside down stairs gallop, the twisting head.. today, just cheap), a mixture of gross and taboo made for shock value pestilence, glorified by the morbid fascination of the bored and willing masses. I swear the ""the power of Christ compels you"" scene is the longest; you might literally find yourself staring at your watch with the most jaded, defeated expression on your face. There is nothing remotely redeeming about it, no interesting development, morality, point of argument...nothing. You could basically watch a one-scene-parody of it, and that would really, actually do it justice.

If you've been brought up as a Christian as I was (I am a Catholic right from the cradle) and start having doubts about the existence of God, Satan, Heaven, and Hell, I strongly urge you to watch this film. The direction, art, staging, and acting of the principals involved was calculated to keep your stomach in knots and goose pimples as large as acne, all over your body from start to finish, and it succeeds in every way. You'll be riveted to your seat throughout this film, and don't be surprised if you have an extremely strong desire to go to the nearest church afterword, because you will. You'll need to, after you watch...""The Exorcist."" Watch this film. But don't do it alone. I watched this film in 1973 at the age of 17 at a local theater with a friend when it was first released (they were handing out sickness bags at the door). Afterword, you'll have no doubt WHATSOVEVER of the existence of God and his powerful and saving Love and Grace. You'll also have no doubt WHATSOEVER of the heinous evil of Satan and his horrific powers of destruction. I was an Alter Boy dropout as well as a Church dropout. But after seeing ""The Exorcist,"" I went back to my church. This film is ABSOLUTELY the scariest, most frightening, and most vivid film in the history of film making. This film was based upon a real exorcism (in real life, a young boy was possessed) and one of the priests involved with the real exorcism was interviewed (I forget on which network) sometime in 1999 along with William Peter Blatty (who was a news reporter at the time of the real exorcism) who wanted to write a series of stories based upon that possession and ultimate exorcism. He was allowed to (by the Church) only after agreeing to change the identities involved and their location, (the people involved craved privacy and Mr. Blatty, being an honorable, decent, and responsible man, acquiesced) instead using pseudonyms and other locations. The result was the book and film, ""The Exorcist,"" a very true, and very real story of the horrors of demonic possession, the exorcism of the demons, and the aftermath. After seeing this film, you'll ABSOLUTELY have no doubt WHATSOEVER of the existence of God, Satan, Heaven, and Hell, for they all DO EXIST! It's up to us to decide which we want to follow.

I much expected it to be one to leave a deep impression in my mind but nope. While some may say that the limited use of jumpscares is what made it amazing (as jumpscares is 'cheap' horror), I more simply saw it as a horror film not doing what it is meant to do aka make you freak out, scream and the such.

I can understand the approach the writers felt when making the film, structuring the series of events as they would occur, but there is something just so mechanical about the process here that takes away from it being such a great horror flick. I'm not saying the film has to be layered in suspense, but provide for something more interesting, rather than listen to dull conversations a majority of the time, especially when they are repeated. Besides this flaw, the film does prove to be a rather impressive piece of work. The acting is phenomenal, notably Linda Blair, whose performance is incredibly surreal and absolutely perfect. The frightening scenes in the film are still quite horrifying, with it surpassing many horror films still even today. Its genuinely frightening how real the film can feel at times, notably in the exorcist type sequences and scenes with Linda Blair. In the end, The Exorcist is not my favorite horror flick, but at times, it can be quite strong. Blair's performance is fantastic and many elements of the film are more than worth its iconic stature in Hollywood and films today.

473,29 April 2019,owengoldstoff,9, More than just shock value..although its shock value is incredible,"This classic horror film hits the mark on all levels. At the beginning Regan is made out to be the sweetest, most fun-loving little girl you'd ever meet. But once she is possessed, that is all left behind. In one scene, she warns a man about his inevitable death, while she pees on a carpet. In another, she repeatedly stabs her genitals and makes her mother lick the blood. Later, she projectile vomits green slime all over a priest's face. This is stuff you simply cannot make up! And although these things are part of what makes the movie so unique, it is worth more than just its shock value. Besides the terrific script, the acting, editing, and cinematography are incredible.

The movie starts out a bit slower, but once it gets going, it goes full speed ahead with Regan being possessed and doing some outrageous things. Although, this is considered a horror classic (and it is), it plays more like a drama for the most part. William Freidkin directed this and is a top class director also responsible for great thrillers like The French Connection and the controversial and much overlooked Crusing, this is really well made. I t spawned 2 sequels,(with pt 3 being my personal favorite of all 3 films) and a ton of obvious rip-offs as well as just being a massively influencial movie in general.

Or doing unmentionable things with a crucifix or swearing about Jesus. Does it make any sense. Not really. Why would the devil enter the body of a little girl who is then strapped to a bed and has holy water thrown at her to torture her. If I was the devil I'd enter the body of someone with more power or the son/daughter of someone with power not the teenage girl of some old movie actress and I would hope that they'd make a better movie about my possession than this one. If someone's head rotated 360 degrees then they would be dead. It make for interesting shocking effect but it doesn't make any sense. Peasoup vomit. Please. I would give this movie 1 out of 10 and that only for it's shock value. Go see The b&w version of the Haunting if you want to be really scared. Even Damien is a more interesting well told story than this one. The only scary bit for me was when the priest listened to what Linda Blair was saying on the recording and it turned out to be in English but backwards. ""Dimmy why you do this to me"".

When the bbfc decided to ban it from video release several years later not on the grounds of extreme violence like the so called video nasties,but basically because they felt it was to scary for the common man,then it's long term reputation was cemented. To live up to the hype was always gonna be a big ask,and unfortunately it doesn't quite make it but makes a valiant attempt. The scenes of possession,head spinning,projectile vomiting and especially the shocking scene with the crucifix truly must have been disturbing to an early seventies audience,and also the opening sounds and first scenes in Iraq are unsettling which create a real feeling of evil and are all responsible for the almost hysterical reaction to the film. But times have changed,people like me of a certain age have witnessed so much horror since then both real and fictional that the mystique of the movie just doesn't wash anymore,worse still when I lent a copy of the film to some younger people during the time of its ban they found it laughable,that was probably more shocking! Overall the Exorcist is a brave movie it is still a classic but unfortunately like many things in Hollywood it is not ageing well.

The sound really added to the suspense. Back to lighting. The lighting when the light shines into the room representing the demons presence is astonishing.

No one is perfect, but everyone loves one another very much, and you grow to love them too. Merrin says in the book (and touches upon it in one of the new restored scenes) that is the Devil's key: to destroy this love in this family, and make us despair of being lovable. One restored scene could have been done away with; it's shocking but doesn't add much.

487,18 March 2017,PredragReviews,9," ""Look What Your C-nting Daughter Did!""","""The Exorcist"" stands in the most hallowed of halls when it comes to horror, having been voted as the scariest movie of all time by the most fans. I envy those who find this film so remarkably frightening, as it really doesn't strike me as particularly scary - unsettling at times, but not scary. The Exorcist truly is a powerful movie experience, filled with several of the most shocking scenes to ever appear on film. I was surprised that so many of the more controversial aspects of the story actually made it from novel to screen, especially in the original 1973 incarnation of the film. It's really impossible for me to say which is better, the film or the novel. There are several subplots and very significant details in the novel that did not make it to the big screen, and a few little things in the movie are hard to interpret outside the context of the novel. Among the most disturbing images in this film are those of the medical tests Regan undergoes after the onset of her problems. I find it much easier to watch the most graphic scenes wherein the demon within Regan attacks her and those around her, although Regan's appearance is shockingly horrible in the later stages of her possession. The demonic manifestations and exorcism are done extremely well in the movie; Friedkin did a much more powerful and convincing job than my own imagination in terms of showing the demonic manifestations. The movie adds several things to the exorcism itself that do not appear in the novel and, by and large, gives the exorcism itself more prevalence than Blatty himself did, yet it also manages to capture and express quite well the inner struggle and soul-rending doubts and fears of Father Karras. This inner struggle of good vs evil, of faith vs hopelessness strikes me as the heart of this story, and the movie communicates this surprisingly well.",

I must say that the special effects is still very good but the rest is just bad and the film is maybe entertaining and watchable but NOT scary anymore.,
490,19 January 2021,johnny-89987,8, the best movie,"Exorcist is not a good movie just because of the horror scenes and horror or the great acting of the actors. Rather, the exorcist is considered a masterpiece because of its great meaning. There is even a reason for the girl to be a victim in the film, and like other films in this genre, it is not without reason. The concept of sacrifice also waves at the end of the film. The irony of science is also that science could not cure the little girl with all its might and thought she was mental! . The special effects of the film are still acceptable after all these years and it pushes against today's films and this shows that this film was ahead of its time. My suggestion to enjoy the movie more is to just watch it with the lights off! Otherwise you will enjoy less. Thanks for reading my review",

Acting was really good and this movie deserves those 2 Oscars. This movie really can teach something to us, like what are we doing? We can say some bad words and be mean to other people. I learned something really important about people around us. We should think what are we doing. We can't just say some bad words if we don't have any reason to say them. I will watch this movie again and again for many years. People can mean to others but we have to think what we're saying to other people. God is important to all of us maybe (well, some of you maybe). Go ahead and watch it!",
492,9 April 2017,Richie-67-485852,10, Scary is as Scary does,"When this first came out, no one knew what to expect except what the general buzz and story line along with movie posters and word of mouth had to say. So imagine you sit down, popcorn, drink and tasty snack wanting to be entertained and to add insult to the wait, the movie doesn't rush to get going which creates a sort of antsy-ness for the viewer. But that is the set-up and it is nicely done. Long before we are introduced to the demon-wars, we are first invited to something no less frightening which is medical procedures to test for illness to explain the little girls issues she has been having. Those scenes are scary of themselves especially the sound affects and the mere suggestion that this is taking place. It reminds me of when they first came out with colonoscopy which is a look-see into the colon. The embarrassment, positioning and probing makes one decide to die rather than go through all that (LOL). Same effect here as one cringes watching and hearing this and cant help but think...I will never go through that. Just kill me. Never the less, we get past that and further drawn into this premise of demon possession. If told just by story, it doesn't chill as well as when you score it and act it out. Still the book does give chills but the movie has you squirming and then some. It helps if someone explains before hand that the Priest in the movie had it out with this demon decades ago and successfully cast it out only making the demon want his revenge which he gets and delights in further scaring you out of your wits. A demon that holds grudges? Whoa! The effect of this movie had people sleeping with lights on for months with reported and documented increases in electric bills across the country. Now that is some good entertainment for the 1970's wouldn't you say? A later scene was added where just when you were getting over the chills brings them all back again its that powerful. This movie made good money and did its job in getting you your moneys worth for a movie going experience. Of course can any of this be true and accurate as depicted? The question often comes up as follows. Is it real? Can this happen? Let me just say that if this was to be answered in a straight forward manner, it would scare you even more than the movie itself. Remember, the bible speaks of possession quite well and how those ""its"" have to come-out thanks to Jesus. Or, you can choose not to believe as the line in the movie ""The Usual Suspects"" spoken by Kevin Spacey when he says ""the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing us he doesn't exist"" . I will let the reader ponder but take note to not mock the subject. It is well-known that the devil can appear as an agent of light meaning something not threatening to the eye but all so deadly to the soul. The weaponry used by evil consists of doubt, hesitation, confusion and beguilement that when used against your weak beliefs prevails. Only those that dabble in less than honorable conduct need fear. Recommend a light snack and tasty drink. No heavy meals as there are vomiting scenes. Enjoy and watch this with someone else and have a bible nearby....just in case",

496,21 June 2022,justahunch-70549,7, To each his own,"I read the book before the movie came out and while I don't remember it all, I do remember not understanding why it was such a best seller. I also remember all the brouhaha this film caused. It was an immense hit and there were stories of people fainting in the theaters, getting ill, etc. I'm sure some of that was publicity, but some was probably true as there are a lot of disturbed people in the world who might not have been able to handle this, especially 49 years ago when we were a bit more sensitive a population and also because it's about religion. While I personally never really understood all the commotion, I thought it was a good enough movie and it had some scenes unlike things we hadn't seen before, but I didn't find it scary perhaps because I had just read the now forgotten book. I always wondered if I wasn't disturbed by this because I was not raised with any religious beliefs and it just seemed like another horror movie to me and this battle with the devil is not something that I find anymore disturbing than Freddy Krueger. Actually, he might have been more scary to me the first time I saw him. Looking at it last night for the first time in decades, I was surprised at how slow the first hour is which is more or less an hour of setup. Burstyn is obviously a good actress, but she's been much better in other things. Blair, as proven after this, can't act, but there is no doubt due to special effects of all kinds that she is effective here. The best performance is by the Pulitzer winning playwright, Jason Miller, who somehow landed this role for his film debut. Looking at this film now, he is the strongest thing in it. I watched this on Netflix and some of the dialogue seems altered, though how much I do not know. This won an Oscar for its writing and I cannot help but wonder why as it's just about its weakest element. Nevertheless, it's a good horror film. It's just not, to me, a great one.",
497,30 October 2021,barryrd,9, Possession and exorcism graphically played out in 20th century Washington,"I was impressed with this movie's cast, its on location shooting and the way the movie projected the most horrifying scenes involving a 12 year old possessed by the devil. I was drawn into the opening scenes in the desert where we see a priest, Father Merrin, played by Max Von Sydow working on archaeological digs in Iraq and coming in contact with an ancient artifact that brings on visions and paranormal experiences resulting in his taking leave from his work and returning to Washington USA. In Washington we find a young woman, Chris MacNeil, played by Ellen Burstyn who is filming a movie near Georgetown University, the Jesuit university where Father Merrin has returned. Through her contacts at the university, Chris comes to know Father Damien Karras. Karras has a mother in New York who he loves very much and visits her in the rundown neighbourhood where she lives. He wants her to move to a residence where she can get better care but she refuses. This haunts him and her death contributes to his struggle to hold on to his vocation and remain in the priesthood. At the same time, Chris's daughter Regan, played by Linda Blair, is subject to strange happenings that become so unnerving Chris has to get her psychiatric help. Nevertheless, her best efforts fail and the events become more serious and even supernatural, resulting in horrific vomiting, levitations and head spinning that puts Chris at her wits end. The only solution she feels she has to try is an exorcism. Although she is not Catholic or religious, she exhorts Father Karras to perform one. The university's Jesuit leadership feels that Father Merrin should undertake the procedure, which he has done before successfully at a great personal toll, one that almost cost his life. What follows is graphic and certainly not for the faint of heart. The stage is set with the 1970's background that is very realistic to the time it was shot. We see people involved with their personal lives and a range of challenges. The exorcism brings these people together in the face of a paranormal event that strongly impacts them and their life experiences. It's traumatic but well worth seeing. To me it is one of the finest films of the 1970's.",

501,7 February 2020,Darkside-Reviewer,8, Stairway to heaven,The Exorcist is now 48 years old and even after so much time it remains to this day one of the scariest demonic possession movies ever made sure movies have come a long way since 1973 and the 80s brought us some of the most memorable and violent slasher movies of all time but before all those blood and gore filled slasher movies were made. The Exorcist shocked audiences with it's unique and interesting story of a young girl who is possessed by a demon and is slowly taken over from the inside to the point where the child is no longer recognisable and the demon has taken full control of her body and soul what made this movie rather shocking for audiences were the heavy religious theme's and the disturbing scene's of the young possessed girl doing horrible things to her own body which becomes more and more disturbing as the demon takes hold of her body and soul one scene also shows the girls head turing completely around as you hear her neck bones crack and disjoint the young child also uses a lot of very repulsive and vulgar language that also touched on religious themes it wasn't something people usually saw in horror movies back in 1973 so when this movie came along people didn't know what to make of it but while it did shock audiences it also gave rise to other unconventional horror movies and we would later end up getting other horror classics like Halloween and Friday the 13th.,

503,30 January 2017,ohlabtechguy,8, Hilarious thriller,"Just watched this on TV and found it very amusing. Not sure why they started the film in Iraq since I didn't think it added anything. Presumably an artifact that was found in Iraq was the source of the ""demons"" that later possessed Linda Blair. The first half was a bit slow...nothing of interest started happening until Linda came down from her bedroom and urinated on the floor in front of her mother's guests. From that point on, it was one huge laugh after the next. The funniest part was where Linda would hurl green vomit at those unfortunate enough to enter her bedroom. This girl was so seriously possessed you wondered how anyone would dare enter her room, including her mother, who at one point was punched out by the 12 year old girl. Ellen did a great job at playing it straight....getting quite hysterical at times and showing great concern over her daughter's deteriorating condition. The movie was very well done and this is why it was so successful, but it didn't scare me. It just made me laugh. It was a hoot, waiting for each new shock that was supposed to just absolutely horrify the viewer. And all the while, you knew how fake and staged it all was.",

538,17 February 2020,jamiedarlow-37510,9, Still profoundly unsettling!,"This film is ranked one of the greatest horror films of all time and for very good reason. It follows the MacNeil family, the mother Chris played by Ellen Burstyn and daughter Regan played by Linda Blair. Slowly something appears to be very wrong with Regan's behaviour, turning from a very sweet and good natured human being into something altogether more sinister. It becomes very apparent that this isn't a mental disorder and she is possessed by the devil himself. The story also follows Father Karras played by Jason Miller who is going through personal trauma and a massive test of faith. It's safe to say that the performances are all great (Miller does such a good job of portraying a fractured but good willed man) however I think the massive standout here is Linda Blair's truly incredible performance as Regan. Regan in her possessed form has become such an iconic horror character; I think what makes it all the more impactful is the fact that she's just a normal playful and sweet young girl as set up in the first act of the film and therefore there's a real sense of menace and threat from the demon inside of her. The shock factor of the film comes from the demons actions, forcing this young girls body to do such grizzly things and these scenes are still some of the most unbelievably twisted sights you are likely to see in cinema today. Just goes to show how controversial the film really was upon release in the early 70s and the amount of bans it had. After these sequences are always very low key and quiet scenes which seem to cement the impact of those already powerful sequences even more which is a very clever move from director William Friedkin. In that sense it is undeniably a classic for being such an influence on modern horror cinema and having such a massive impact. I think for my generation it may have less of an impact now as we are raised in a world that has a lot of 'video nasties' and we have exposed ourselves as film fans to a wide range of disturbing or just plain scary content. It is still essential viewing in particular for Linda Blair's performance and the last half an hour which is just excellent filmmaking",

The opening sequences in Iraq, which drag on interminably, have nothing to do with what comes after.  When we finally arrive at the locale of the action, a lot of nothing ensues very slowly and to no frightening effect.  It's hard to see what it was about this film that scared so many; perhaps it was simply the shock of the sacrilegious comments coming from a little girl's mouth.  Truly, ""The Exorcist"" commits the worst two sins a horror film can; it bores and it fails to frighten.  That said, it is still a well-made film with intelligence and a nice visual style; it just fails totally as a horror film.",

Some people say movies that make you think are the best.  I disagree.  The best are like the Exorcist where you don't think about anything.  You just watch in amazement on what's going on. You are not thinking the movie would be better if or what's going to take place next.  Your mind is clearly on the movie.  For example, when Reagan turns her head around and says, ""You see what she did?""  I was completely glued to the screen and I think you will be too.  In fact, from then on I was hooked.

The film actually has positive Christian messages to an extent, but there a lot of facts that are too misconstrued for this to be recommended as a Christian. Demon possessions and exorcisms are real but how the devil himself works is not in this manner. If evil were always so ugly and sinister, then so many people would stay away from it but that's not how it works. Keep in mind that this film was 'inspired' by a true story, not based on one. It is very fictitious, and more of a catholic vehicle than anything. Linda Blair actually shows promise as a young actress that never really developed. Max Von Sydow is wonderful in a limited amount of time. Ellen Burstyn does a good job, but really got on my nerves with her emotional outbursts. Like I said, see it at least once. Then pop in a cartoon or something to get it out of your mind.",

545,8 May 2020,Rendanlovell,7, A victim of its own reputation,"There are only so many movies out there whose reputation towers over it. The Exorcist may be at the top of that short list. It looms over everyone that goes to watch. Everyone has heard of ""the scariest movie ever made"". Churches have told members to avoid this on the grounds of it being evil. Everyone knoes about the Exorcist, which is why it's so difficult to go into this with clean eyes. Try as I might to avoid hearing about this film, it was inevitable to hear or see some spoilers. The walking down the stairs backwards scene, the crucifix scene, and the priest jumping out the window are nearly impossible to avoid. Since this is such a victim of it's reputation, people not only want to prove it's worth but as many people want to discredit it. Like it or not this movie has stuck around and I think it's here to stay. One thing to mention out of the gate is the time period it was made in. The movie was released in 1973 so if you expect this to resemble modern horror, you're going to be disappointed. It's almost 50 years old now. That comes with some amount of date. Some of the effects aren't the best and the pacing is different then something more modern. Which are really my only issues here, despite me just not really getting into it. It's a bit dated now and at times feels tedious. Which is odd considering that the presentation here is quite stark and abrupt. The editing is quite harsh and there's a lot of hard cuts from one thing to the next. It feels like it doesn't have any time to waste and the progression of time is quick. It's quite the bizarre pacing/editing experience to say the least. I like the idea of the film showing the long painful process of getting the exorcism. The mother goes to the hospital, shrinks, and finally she turns to religion as a last ditch effort to save her daughter. On paper, I love that idea. In practice I think there is to much time spent on other things for it to work completely. Even though I didn't really get sucked into it, there are many moments that I loved. The entire sequence where Regan is getting examined by doctors is legitimately unsettling. I also loved almost everything to do with Father Karras. I liked his trials of faith, the scene when he visits his mother, and every time he talks with Regan. His arc from a man on the brink of leaving the church to coming face to face with pure evil and overcoming it is great. He's by far the most compelling and well rounded character here. The mother character being pushed to her wits end is nice but I didn't much care for the performance. Overall, it's still a really good movie. There's lots of great ideas at play, unsettling sequences, and great character work. It doesn't all come together completely but I think it's still rather effective.",

551,6 January 2020,gurpreetbajwa,6," Good, But A Little Dated","This is the first time I'd seen the Exorcist and as anyone who is a fan of movies knows. This is considered by many to be not just one of the greatest horror movies of all time, but one of the greatest movies of all time period. In terms of pure film making and pushing boundaries of the culture it was made in there are a lot of things to be admired. However the one thing that the Exorcist wasn't in my opinion was scary. Now since fear is a completely emotional reaction it's impossible to say with 100% what is or is not scary. So I'm sure that someone else was shaking in their seat watching this. However that person isn't me. I would go as far as to say that the ""HORROR/SUPERNATURAL"" scenes in this movie range from okay to hilariously meme worthy. I suppose that this is the consequence of when your pushing boundaries. Anyone who looks into the history of this film and the media circus that surrounded it upon it's release will understand that this movie triggered a lot of people at a time in American history when belief in Religion and cultural definitions of what is moral, funny, and fit to show on screen were completely different to how it is now. So when watching this movie I had to have two minds about it, I think back to how a 1973 American would react to this, and I imagine a person throwing up or walking out offended and traumatized by what they had just seen while clutching their pearls. However from a modern stand point those same scenes come off as something an edge lord kid would be screaming at you over Xbox live from his moms basement, or what some internet troll would be spamming to people on social media. I also found the ending to be a big What? moment as well, didn't really get the point if even their was a point to get. There were many moments were I genuinely was invested which is do credit to the character drama and the actors performances as well as the directing which is excellently done. I quiet enjoyed this movie despite its flaws and would defiantly recommend it to everyone to watch at least once. Even if you don't find it that scary, it's very entertaining.",

It started great with the mysterious personalities of Regan MacNeil. That was really exciting. The demon inside Regan slowly evolved, and it felt very strange. Some of the first jump scares were very surprising in brutally ways, especially the staircase scene and the first head-rotation scene. They were my favorite scenes because the were unexpected! Those type of scenes are fantastic works of the horror genre! The cinematography, the practical effects and the sound were just amazing! Anyway, I think the second half was a little weak, though. The build-up in the first half was very interesting, but once the conversation scenes with the demon appeared, it lost my interest. The demon wasn't that scary or mysterious anymore. We ""saw"" the demon with our naked eyes, and since it wasn't that scary anymore, I expected even more of the demon. Unfortunately the story ended in a predictable way, which was a little disappointing. So in total, I think this movie had fantastic technical aspects, but lost the grip of suspense in the second half.",

Ellen Burstyn is amazing in this film! Father Karras (Jason Miller) is amazing, you cannot take your eyes off him. Sad life unfortunately.

The beginning of the movie is incredibly well-done in terms of sound as well. The diegetic commotion surrounding Father Merrin followed by almost complete silence until the non-diegetic, intense music is played when he faces the demon statue works very well to create an uneasy feel. The play with sound to create a mood is apparent throughout the film, especially with Regan's different, haunted voices and noises. ",

Regan's face is disfigured and contorted but the stark shadows is what really makes it demonic... the music is especially fitting i was surprised the iconic tubular bells only played twice in the whole picture... the picture itself is flawless the copy i have showed no signs that it is from the 70s no scratches no markers and the grain only helps make the picture look darker and more severe... watch as a very normal situation slowly goes mad and out of control... the entire look of the film is different by the time the credits roll... as a horror fan its an absolute essential as a movie buff... its still essential... definitely not for the faint of heart... highly recommended,

Why was he so afraid of it? Why does the Devil choose Linda Blair's character to inhabit? Perhaps the book answers these questions. Perhaps the sequels answer them. I am referring to the limited release of the directors cut version of the movie. 11 minutes of extra footage. The movie ""Poltergeist"" scared me more than this movie.

I should also note that I do not think of demonic possession as being within the realm of possibility. Moreover, having been born some years after The Exorcist came out, I am too young to be impressed by images and special effects that were considered especially explicit back in 1973.

I know a person who is so scared by this movie, that he bought it on DVD and hasn't even taken the plastic film off the case! However, I do applaud the visual effects, they are horrifyingly awesome!

The head spin the crucifix spider walk all little things its more disturbing that scary. In the day yes it would have been proper scary horror but even now people still hype up the exorcist to be a brilliant scary film when its clearly not. OK the appearance of the girl the make up the thought of it questioning your beliefs or whatever, it is still a generally good film i just wished that it wasn't hyped up so much to be shockingly scary i gave it 5 out of 10 mainly for the fact that its a good film and the plot is very well put together. but i realised that it is disturbing so i gave it a 6 ! don't watch it if your looking for scary i recommend REC or paranormal activity 28 weeks later or if your still looking for that same exorcism genre then the last exorcism will do it watch this for being disturbed not because you want to be scared !",
584,11 January 2011,Wrapper30,10, My favourite film of all time.,This is more than a mere horror film but a classic case of good against evil. The book is excellent and for once a director captures it on film perfectly. All the main parts are played with passion and realism. The story starts slowly with flashes of evil placed to unnerve and keep you on your toes. Then a sudden change in pace whacks you round the head and makes your head spin till the chilling finale. This lived with me for years from my first view at the age of 12. I plucked up the courage to watch it again in my early 30's and learned to appreciate it more. The film has benefited from recent revamps and Mark Kermode's documentary aids to the appreciation. Freidkin is my favourite director for this film alone.,

The special effects, makeup and costumes are 10x better than any Netflix movie now. The story and special effects were beyond their time. I remember when this came out people were screaming in the cinemas and many had nightmares after. This is one of those movies that everytime you watch it you discover more details you missed.

After all these years i still can not watch this movie by my self. The question allot of people ask is why is this movie so scary? I say it's because it's very realistic. The movie is more of a drama the first hour or so, really allot of storytelling and getting to know the characters before anything really happens, which makes the impact even bigger when something actually does happen. You'll live and feel with the characters. Especially with Regan's mother, Chris (Beautifully played by Ellen Burstyn).",

But everything else is great, it still managed to deliver the same aural presence that I remembered when I saw it as a kid. I think it could be the fact that Jack MacGowran and several other people died making this movie, they are probably getting all the people who are watching this film, and bravo to them (poor guys)!! Although the editing in all the scenes that foreshadow this movie didn't seem to be planned very well, it had little impact on the rest of the movie, which is rare. The screenplay has one small thing, a SPOILER to be sure, but a small irk nonetheless, the crucifix scene (I can't see how she's raping or masturbating w/ it) looked a little silly to me, it should've had more eroticism to it, better subjective lighting would've been a plus. The way it's presented would make me think, ""Oh, what's she doing now ?"" rather than ""!"" But I think that was the only way to get it past the censors back in 73', everything else is precision and atmophere, which this movie carries well. A 9, with another hand to the people who died on the set of this film, it'll carry on if they have a say in it!",

I gave it five stars because of the time period in which it was filmed and the effort that was put into it. If it was a new film I'd give it a two. There's way better horror out there.,

But I have to say that after 30 years this isn't anymore the most terrific movie on earth. I don't want to say that I've been bored because it's still a fantastic opera. The scenes with the devil are very effective and the performances of the actors (especially by the tormented Jason Miller and the newcomer and astonishing good Linda Blair) are very very good. The scenes I liked much more are the beginning in Iraq with Max Von Sydow, who begins to fear that there's something strange, the arrival of the already possessed Regan at the party in her house and the final fight against evil with the sudden and brave decision of Father Karras. William Friedkin does a very good job in directing with a lot of subliminal frames of the devil and also compliments to Rick Baker for the make up, Mike Oldfield for the famous music and Owen Roizman for the livid photography.",

There are many others that are better I just named the ones that are at the top of there game. The Exorcist has huge gaping holes of logic missing that you could only believe and fall into it's trappings if you were a catholic. I am not. I find the movie to be painstakingly slow and uneventful. I guess if you find jump cuts and loud noises to be scary then this movie is for you. I also hate how William Fredkin is so prissy about everything, like he is the grandmaster of cinema, sorry that spot goes to Wes Craven who himself made a far, far better film only a year earlier and in a shorter amount of time and with a lot less money. That film was of course Last House on the Left. I suggest seeing that as it will shock you far more and it is indeed grounded in reality unlike this turd of a film.

I had heard that there are disturbing moments (such as Linda Blair masturbating with the crucifix), and the image of the demon on her bedroom wall when her mother leaves the room, but beyond that it isn't really something that I find scary. It's easy to see why most people with probably a weak stomach may be turned by it but to tell you the truth this movie is actually funnier than it is scary.

The Exorcist was the story of a demon possessed preteen played by Linda Blair and contained very controversial content including nauseating special effects like 360 head rotations, masturbation and self-mutilation with a crucifix and absurdly powerful projectile vomiting. The film was a blockbuster in 1973 despite reports of movie goers fleeing the theaters in fear and disgust, mass hysteria was even reported at some theaters requiring paramedics to be called in.",

605,23 September 2008,theodoremartin,9, As Influential Now as It was Then,"I still consider The Exorcist the most influential movie I have ever seen as it had me question, as those involved intended, what it is that I believe. I grew up in a mixed home in that my mom was a devout Christian and my father was a devout atheist, and I dated a Jewish girl through most of my high school days. I never knew what to believe. My parents always wanted me to make up my own mind, but both attempted to influence me with their individual beliefs. I viewed The Exorcist on its re-release in 1975 (or so) when I was around 12 or 13. It scared, forgive the pun, the hell out of me, but more importantly, it made me THINK! I began to both read The Bible and books on the occult. In addition, I bought many scientific books as well to see what they had to say on certain religious themes. I am thankful for such an influential film as The Exorcist which began a five year journey for me to discover what I believe in. There are very few films that make one think about such heavy issues as life and death, heaven and hell, science and God, and so forth. Some films have a way of staying influential inspite of time and some go way beyond what their genre typically entails. While this is a movie, it much more than ""just a movie"". In addition, this film is definitely NOT just another horror story. The Exorcist belongs right up there with other influential classics such as To Kill a Mockingbird, Natural Born Killers, Roots, The Killing Fields, and Platoon, and other such thought-provoking films that either make a statement or ask us to make one. The very fact that after 30 years this film still has the power to move us speaks volumes to its importance and influence.",

The book, which was written by William Peter Blatty, would probably scare an atheist. When the demons start yelling, Merrin! Merrin! Merrin Nnnn! That sent some chills down my spine when I read the book, and I don't even believe in demons. The Special effects in this movie were the best ever done up to that time in a horror movie, and were all done without the aid of digital effects. Linda Blair plays the demons possessed Regan, and I was surprised she was allowed to play such a graphic role at her age, until I learned she wasn't in most of the more graphic scenes. The crucifix scene has to be one of the most notorious in Hollywood history. Ellen Burstyn is believable as the at first concerned and then terrified mother. Cobb is great as usual as the probing police Lt. Kinderman. Max Von Sydow lends good support, as the doomed Father Merrin, and he is the famed hat and coat in the fog and shadows as he makes his way from a taxi to the front of the MacNeil house. Jason Miller is a key figure in the film as father Karras, a psychologist priest who has lost his faith and is charged with Regan's case.

I have watched this film probably more than thirty times, and, notwithstanding Mark Kermode's claims that it is simply the best film ever made (a claim I have difficulty refuting), even his accolades don't contain appropriate kudos to Mr Miller's acting. Don't get me wrong, Ellen Burstyn really should have won the Oscar for actress for this, she is mesmerising, and von sydow and all the supporting actors are amazing, but Miller's performance is a complete revelation, his character experiences the most dramatic emotional and spiritual arc, there is a moment during the exorcism in which he is looking at Regan and Merrin, it is one of the most believable moments of transition I think I have ever seen, his faith is being restored because he is witnessing the true exorcism of a true demon...........next time you watch this film, watch him, he really is amazing.....",

The first 40 minutes confirmed my thoughts - slow, boring, with a poor special effect of the Pazuzu statue and barking dogs in the desert. Yup, this was a dated, boring film. But suddenly, the psychologist comes along and speaks 'to the person inside Regan', and it all changes. That voice is heard, and it gets scarier and scarier from then on. A few of the scenes which stand out for me: the fit she has at the hospital, which we watch on a CCTV type screen - very creepy; the holy water scene, with the water ripping scars in her legs; the talking backwards tape replay when the phone rings suddenly (is it her? I wondered); the demon's voice; the horrific sound affects when they're downstairs looking at the bedroom; the scene when the objects in the bedroom are spinning around; the headturning scene and its sound effect; teasing the audience by slowly zooming in on the bedroom door - what does she look like now?, I wondered in terror.

621,14 May 2005,jmcleod_5,10, Truly scary,First I'll start by saying that while The Exorcist is the scariest horror movie ever made it is not the best in my opinion. I rank The Omen and A Nightmare on Elm Street higher. Both movies are fun to watch but neither are scary. ( Well maybe The Omen a little. ) The Exorcist is the only movie ever to disturb me. I watch it these days and I find nothing perturbing about it. However I'm a little more cynical these days than in the early eighties when I first saw it. I was only about fifteen or sixteen when my mother brought the video home not knowing what it was about. The tape was turned off immediately when it came to the crucifix scene. I never saw the rest of the film until 1990 London when it was shown in a theatre on Shaftsbury Avenue. I was glad to revisit it in all it's glory. Having become a non-believer in that space of time I could watch the film for what it was. A very good night's entertainment. One thing struck me though a few years later when I bought the 25th anniversary edition. It's not the gore and spectacle that scare you or remain with you when you leave the theatre. It's the little things. When the clock stops at the start of the film. The rustling noise in the attic. The subliminal flash of a white face. Whenever Reagan says something about Captain Howdy. It still sends shivers up my spine. The blood and the gore don't interest me. It leaves nothing to the imagination. The Exorcist works brilliantly as a psychological thriller and I think that's where the scares come from. I love this film and revisit it every now and then just to get those goosebumps rising.,

In Regan's case there is no father; only empty wealth, which, unfortunately is no substitute. The result is that Regan lives in a kind of hell; slowly asphyxiating beneath the weight of her mother's madness.

To sum up if you are under 30 years old and you grew up with ""A nightmare on elm street"" and ""Candyman"" just to name a couple of the more modern horror films, you will find this as scary as an episode of ""home and away"" not a film i will watch again.",
630,12 May 2006,frances2533,10, This is one of the best horror movies ever made!,"I have read the book by William Peter Blatty, and this movie is very close to it-he helped direct it I believe. It is truly scary if you believe in the possibility of evil and possession, it will keep you up at night. The special effects are awesome, especially for a movie from this time period-Reagan is really freaky when she is possessed. And I have to say in The Version You've Never Seen, the couple effects that they added and the scenes, really added to it-I used to have the original version, and I like the newer one, too. I recommend reading the book, for those of you who like to read, as well. Because there is more detail in a book, than they could possibly fit in the movie. For example, the only scene, that I've always thought needed an explanation, for those who hadn't read the book, is the one where the priest is in Iraq-because it doesn't tell tell you much about the significance of what he's found, or the demon itself that possesses Reagan. This is my all time favorite horror movie!",
631,23 February 2004,TerminalMadness,10, All time greatest horror film...,"Voted ""The scariest movie of all time"" by movie critics worldwide, and numerous film institutes, and also banned by bible thumper Billy Graham who declares there is an actual demon in the films celluloid, this shocking horror movie based on the novel by William Peter Blatty made waves in the seventies causing loads of controversy with audiences, religious organizations, and even spawned a mystery when strange accidents began occurring throughout the filming. This tells the story of young Reagan Macneil, a beautiful little girl who lives with her single struggling actress mother. The two have lost faith in life and god until weird incidents start to occur within their house and young Reagan's personality begins to rapidly change when she begins muttering Latin and becomes increasingly violent. Desperate, Reagan's mother seeks out the help of a young priest who has also lost faith in god due to a hard life, and along with an experienced old winded reverend, who has finished a hard battle with the devil years before, the two will attempt to discover if Reagan is possessed by the devil and battle for her soul and their sanity.        Shocking, terrifying, and aggressively character driven, this is arguably the greatest horror movie of all time by horror fans. With the incredible dark direction from William Friedkin, he supplies an incredibly scary horror movie which was boycotted by religious groups in the seventies. The movie takes its time by introducing the likable vulnerable characters slowly and develops the plot with ease making way for the shocking finale which will literally put chills down the viewers spines. There are some rather incredible special effects that were ahead of its time and rather influential being used again and again in latter day horror flicks. There are a lot of memorable scenes in the film including when Reagan is floating from her bed, the scene where her head spins, and the infamous vomit sequence. This spawned two sequels, and inspired much research into the occult, this is an excellent film and as a hardcore horror fan, this is my all time favorite horror movie.",

Just look at art and music, which even more radically changes taste over the centuries.

In 1973 you threw a stone into a still pond. He has led a path like no other ever. Considering it just a horror in my opinion is very limiting. It must be considered that in those years very few people had an idea of what an Exorcist was. Many didn't even have any connection to demonic possessions or deeds. I'm sorry when people only remember the protagonist's vomiting or swearing or monstrous makeup. As I said this is great cinema. A fundamental component in this film that makes it great is silence. Silence plays a fundamental role because it creates the sense of real time passing and the suspension of the events that will have to happen. Today it is very little used, unfortunately.",

637,11 January 2007,walken_on_sunshine,8, The Exorcist,"The Exorcist is not scary but it is indeed very good especially for a film made in the 1970's when make up effects were not as great as they are today.Taking age into consideration is a must as yes this movie does feel like you are watching something old but the storyline is enough to keep you watching.The first 45 minutes are as rather slow but this is when the storyline really perks your interest nothing scary happens but the discussion topics and conversations are really intriguing and get you thinking about what's going to happen next.The rest of the film is filled with some intense,adrenaline pumping scenes that are most definitely genre defining.What they decided to do with this little possessed girl character is really very innovative.The situations are very odd and well disturbing for those who are easily scared however i found none of it frightening at all just really interesting and intense.For any of you who have seen X-Men:The Last stand it's like a darker,more eerie version of the scene with Phoenix in her house but with that same passion and adrenaline that just gets you excited and into it.This movie is very very unique and really relies on atmosphere to draw you into it you can almost feel how cold Regans room is.I didn't find the demons voice scary at all honestly to me it sounded like a New Yorker who smokes a lot yelling obscenities and threats so that took a lot of the creepiness away for me personally.I love all of the subtle things you notice like faces in the room or shadows or just little orb like things it really makes you feel like you're watching something that is footage,very good, effective film-making.Overall The Exorcist is a film bound to scare young children or easily frightened people to death but for those completely desensitized to horror films it is not scary but definitely a great piece of cinema with memorable scenes that would inspire many horror films to come.",

A garrulous detective (Lee J. Cobb, fun and sneaky)investigates a random murder. Elsewhere, a middle-aged priest (Jason Miller, passionate and wonderful) who is forced to abandon his mother for his priesthood struggles with his cause. Elsewhere, still, is an elderly priest (Max Von Sydow, magnificent)who has come face to face with evil...and survived. All these characters will collide at the climax of an unspeakable and powerfully dark horror: this is The Exorcist. The one film continuously labeled as The Scariest Movie of All Time earns it's title unlike so many before it...and after it. A talented cast of actors at the absolute top of their game, a director who will go just far enough to frighten and move the viewer, and an eerily suspenseful backdrop all give credence to one of the few films in the horror genre to be taken seriously by pompous critics. Some think of The Exorcist as an evil film. It simply isn't. What The Exorcist is, what it represents, is an earthly battle between good and evil. An extremely strong and disturbing drama that just happens to be about the supernatural. Will The Exorcist still frighten viewers today? Depends on the average viewer. Film-goers have become desensitized by all the mindless violence and cheese-ball horrors that have come and gone since then. But the film hits the viewer in an entirely different way. It shakes your beliefs and challenges your faith. The subliminal imagery still holds up to this day, while the less sophisticated scares are still quite powerful. Try getting the score, Tubular Bells, out of your head even days later. If you are a film lover and you still haven't seen this, horror fan or not, make time for this one.

649,27 September 2000,cinemel,8, A horror classic has its soundtrack and visuals digitally spruced up.,"A new digitally spruced up version of the classic film, `The Exorcist', has been released to theaters. The soundtrack now has subtle and loud and scary sound effects. The visuals contain various subliminal Devilish faces flashed quickly at certain points and 11 minutes of material deleted from the final cut, but included in similar form on the currently available DVD release in a superb documentary. Otherwise, the tale still packs quite a wallop. Its impact is certainly greater on the big theater screen. The key to the film's class is the perfect performance of Max Von Sydow in the title roll. The iconic scene where he arrives at the home of the possessed Regan still sends chills up the spine. The gross out scenes are still there (pea soup, head twirling and rattling bed). In addition there is the cut cult scene of Regan scrambling spider-like down the stairs drooling blood. And, on it goes. If you've never seen it in a theater it is worthwhile. If you like a good scare and don't mind the gore, it's not as disgusting as some of the more recent slice and dice epics. Be sure to rent the DVD to hear William Friedkin (director) and William Peter Blatty (writer, also novel) heatedly discussing the deleted scenes which have been added to this version. The new ending slightly blunts the coldness of the original, but the optimism of the new millennium gives the added scene a definite resonance.",

The priest as well is having problems, not with Satan, but with the passing of his mother. Anyway, back to the review.

Some of the scenes in The Exorcist, such as Reagan stabbing ""herself"" with a crucifix, should have landed it the X-rating. Somehow though it Received an R- rating instead. Some people complain that some of the scenes are senseless and have no meaning, I disagree that this is not true. The scenes have meaning, vague, but they do.

The acting is top notch, the direction is masterful, and there are lots of truly terrifying moments. This is not like today's mainstream horror utilizing cheap jump scares every few minutes.

The blasphemous, swearing, Godless mother who is perhaps cursed from the start, placing all her faith in man and science, is sure to meet her fate. She becomes fertile territory for attracting evil spirits and as a result her daughter is attacked by demons of high placement. This movie is clever in its research because it is based on actual events that took place in and around Washington D.C. in the 1940s (Georgetown). This movie really frightened me and it is because, I believe, that there may be a spiritual truth to what Jesus reveals about demons in the New Testament. This film will touch your unconscious mind powerfully because it is revealing secrets of the supernatural world that surround us daily in a spiritual warfare that we need protection from. This movie will haunt you long after viewing it and I think it would be unwise to watch this film more than once because there is a potential to stimulate an awakening curiosity of a prurient and depraved nature that could steer some people down a dangerous path.

I've always thought it one of the most tedious pictures I've ever had to sit through. It really doesn't have much more than shock value going for it, and the strength of that has faded a great deal in the thirty-odd years since its release. The psychological aspects of the picture are about on the level of Dr. Phil (I thought Exorcist III was much more engrossing in this area).

The Priest conflicted, losing his faith and shook by such a horrible death of the mother. A mother whose husband is somewhere in Europe and won't even call for her daughter's birthday. A Priest in his old age, very ill and lonely. This is all stuff that would make a perfectly good drama. A human drama. What happens when a drama meets a paranormal movie? A total disaster.

This movie was so original (even though it was based of a novel) and in my opinion still the scariest movie of all time. With amazing writers, actors, director, and cinematography this showed people the potential horror movies have! Now a days the best people come up with is ""SAW 5"" or ""Scream 4"". Why do people insist on making shitty remakes when ""Paranormal Activity"" has shown people you can still make an original horror movie in modern times and have it be a big success. Now ""Paranormal Activity"" doesn't really stack up to the ""The Exorcist"" (1973) but still fits in the category of amazing horror movies. The key recipe I believe this movie figured out is to slowly disturb people. I mean at first Regan MacNeil simply wireds you out by pissing on the floor at a dinner party then saying some nasty things to the guests but before you know it shes crab walking backwards down the stairs, her head is spinning around 360, and I've soiled my pants! I guess It matters that I was 10 when I first saw this movie but even though I may not show it, it scares me just as much today as it did back then.

Even all these years later, it's still seriously, seriously freaky, even though I can't say I was as terrified or legitimately scared as I was with the conjuring movies, however The Exorcist still packs a huge punch, especially in the age of practical effects, no CGI or anything modern we take for granted, and yet it still manages to be far more effective than most of the horror movies we see nowadays. The possession of the little girl is actually disturbing, with some truly freaky moments, which were met with gasps. The ending was a little abrupt, and mildly confusing, but nothing obnoxious. Also I would have loved some more backstory on the demon, but I also realize that that would have been a little difficult to incorporate, especially as this movie was a step into the unknown, and the first true horror movie, after which every movie in the genre borrowed something.

Other people who might yet have the patience to sit through this might like it better though. Don't misunderstand me here, I have seen and enjoyed a lot of movies that would be considered old now or even 30 years ago. What is different about this one?

697,25 October 2000,Mr.Uxo,8, Classic Horror Rereleased,"I first saw the Exorcist as a child many years ago.  It was scary then and is still scary 27 years later.  This classic horror story has been rereleased with an additional 11 minutes of unseen footage not shown in the original release.  However, I was unable to determine where exactly the 11 minutes were thrown in.  I do feel that the film concentrated too much on the relationship between mother and daughter, and not enough on the priests and the exorcism itself.  After watching the film, I had a personal hatred towards the character of the mother, played by Ellen Burstyn, because of her constant disregard and selfishness for the safety and well-being of all those persons involved in trying to help her daughter.  The film follows the gradual deterioration of the young, innocent girl played by Linda Blair as she is overcome and possessed by the devil until she is barely recognizable. Her Mother becomes more desperate as the film goes on until she finally seeks the help of the priest (Father Karras), played by Jason Miller (I), who does an excellent job.  Eventually, Father Merrin, played perfectly by Max von Sydow, is called upon to assist Father Karras in the exorcism of the demon from the child.  This film includes some very classic scenes which are very graphic for the era it was released.  Excellent supporting cast including Lieutenant Kinderman played by Lee J. Cobb and Father Dyer played by Reverand William O'Malley.  An erie musical score adds to the films scariness.  I am not a big fan of horror films and if this film had spent more time on the Priests and less on the mother, I would have given it a perfect 10.  Instead, 8 out of 10.",

699,20 January 2023,gedwards-93032,10, A work of art,"No one was prepared for this in 1973. Forget what you've seen since, this was then a brand-new experience of horror but more than that simple concept, it took us deeply into psychological and probably social corruption. Fascinating to think that at the time Max von Sydow was in his early 40s. His brief performance was extremely commanding but the most magnificent portrayal was Ellen Burstyn's tortured, terrified Mother. Friedkin was at his best and there are scenes in this movie that can never be forgotten. Some simply works of art. The priest arriving at the house late at night under a misty light. The Exorcist receiving his summons, in a cold and thoughtful walk in the woods, knowing it's portent. For me, the first scenes of this film, at an archaeological dig in Nineveh, through to the introduction of the rowing crew in Georgetown, is the most compelling movie introduction that I've seen. And while this was an extraordinary piece of work, possibly an even better adaptation of a William Peter Blantyre work was his own direction and teleplay of Exorcist III, with George C Scott. I recommend watching The Exorcist followed swiftly by Exorcist III, both Brilliant and related storylines with vastly different direction but similarly unique outcomes.",

There is no greater example of a film which portrays this than The Exorcist (1973). When I was younger I was never fond of the film. It was way too slow for me and I couldn't get invested into it until the very end when chaos strikes. Growing older I have come to appreciate it more and more up to the point where I will avidly defend it. Telling the tale of the penetration of what is pure and righteous, the film serves as an interesting character study of a holy man desperately trying to regain his faith in God and morality. In the film as we follow Father Damien Karras, portrayed excellently by Jason Miller. I was deeply affected by his profuse devastation over leaving his mother to join priesthood in spite of her wishes. His shattered fraught even causes the man of faith to debate his own said faith, truly wondering if it was all worth it in the end. As we all know the great late Max Von Sydow delivers a show stopping performance as the bad ass Father Lancester Merrin, the sensible matter-of-fact priest who seems to be just two days from retirement. I do love Miller and Sydow's chemistry in the later half of the film when they have to take on the villainous Pazuzu. It's always so great to see the student and the master dynamic when it's done right in films. Speaking of the demon child, a review of The Exorcist is not complete without at least mentioning Linda Blair's Academy Award nominated performance as Regan MacNeil. What else could I say about it? It was great. Instead, I'll talk briefly about some of the other performances before I get into my very few gripes with the film. Despite her Academy Award nomination, I don't think people give enough credit to Ellen Burnstyn for her performance as Regan's poor mother Chris. In spite of being a well known celebrity within the film, the character is often desperate and worried and anxious to be rid of whatever is inside her daughter. She is an atheist and probably had passed her beliefs to her daughter. I don't think I've ever seen a mother this loving in any film.

She stayed for the entire movie, but told me there were people literally crawling up the aisles in the middle of the movie. She called our pastor to talk about how the movie bothered her. That the movie bothered people speaks volumes. The topic of evil, true evil, invading our lives and the lives of our loved ones is one we rarely face, but the Exorcist forced many to face it. But the topic is a gripping one. The story was well written. You are drawn in to the story and soon feel the terror of the principals. The acting was outstanding. Linda Blair was very good in her role. She was believable as the young girl and she was extremely creepy when Regan was ""possessed."" Jason Miller, who was new to the silver screen, was incredible as Father Karras. Of course, Max Von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb and Ellen Burstyn were outstanding. While the acting was great, some credit should be given the casting direction, not only for casting the actors I've mentioned, but for the inspired casting of non-actors in some critical roles. First among these were Vasiliki Maliaros, who was cast as the mother of Father Karras. She had no previous acting experience and was discovered working in a Greek restaurant. It was her only movie. There is also Father Thomas Bermingham and Father William O'Malley. O'Malley was very good as Father Dyer and his acting was not only extremely good, but if you had told me he was a priest while I was watching the Exorcist, I wouldn't have believed you. I thought he was a trained and experienced actor. The direction of this movie was second to none. Not overly loud, but not silent, shocking when it needed to be, but not so much so that the shocking moments lose their punch. The movie starts quietly and builds to it's climax.

But I am a hard person to scare. Only at very few times, horror movies works for me. But to give you examples: I love horror movies like Poltergeist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Alien. While those are movies that makes me get scared, there are movies people consider scary I only laugh at - The Shining is a good example. One so-called ""scary"" moment there is when we see the boy sit in bed and shake his head. Personally, it's THE most funny moment I have ever seen in my entire life. I laughed so hard, I had to pause the movie for five minutes. How could I get scared of a movie that makes me laugh? That's the same problem I have with The Exorcist. It's considered the most scary movie of all time. I heard of these before I watched it, and therefor thought it would really be scary. So I sat down to watch it, and... I seriously still have a hard time to convince myself it was not a comedy. A girl cursing, doing awkward stuff, looking butt-ugly, sounding like a person getting choked and tries to impersonate Gollum at the same time... what's scary in all of this? It's so over-the-top, I can't keep a straight face. The girl is possessed by the devil, who's a nutty perv! And at one time, she pukes big time on the priest... oh help, I'm SO scared. And what's up with when she crawls down the stairs upside down? It makes no sense, is a little confusing and disturbing - but scary? Not according to me, anyway.

Although a movie like this wouldn't shock as nearly as much today, it still hardly seems dated.",
724,14 February 2007,rusty10113,10, THE scariest of all time,"I've enjoyed reading all the comments, and most share my belief that start to finish, for overall quality, combination of storytelling, shock, horror and brilliance, The Exorcist trumps every other horror film. I do think it comes down to sensibility, and move goers today are so desensitized by Saw and Hostel that a more 'thoughtful' horror film like this gets tossed off as irrelevant. How can anyone watch the last half hour and not be at the very least creeped out by it all? That one close up shot of Regan's demonic face, it lasts about 2 seconds, still makes me avert my eyes from the screen. Hideous! Again, it's about being drawn into the story or just looking for a Freddy or Jason moment, but Im glad I'm the type to appreciate this for what it is--one of the best films every made, and the most fascinating to discuss, ponder over and find trivia about, even now.",

1) Where oh where did the demon come from? Why did it come? In the Director's cut, we were in Northern Iraq where the priest was facing off a statue in the desert, and we suddenly cut to Washington D. C. to an actress's house. With all the walking in the movie, you would've thought they would show you how the statue walked all the way to North America
2) There is literally no further information about the demon other than OOOOH SCARY DEMON
3) It possesses.... a kid. Like really an 8 year old. How and why is this meant to be scary??? Like cmon, people can take it lol. Now if it had possessed a priest, that would've been another matter - could've gone on a serial killer killing spree
4) The death of the priest came out of flipping nowhere
5) What was that Lieutenant stalker character???? Honestly that scene went nowhere
6) It just goes 0 to 100 - a bunch of random plotlines that were never followed. What happened to the kids father in Rome? How did the demon get to the priests mum?",

745,24 April 2007,ChromiumVortex,10, Excellent movie with no virtual reality,"Horror films have been reduced to virtual reality images representing demons, monsters, or other evil entities. ""The Exorcist"" did not use any of this bogus technology that we see in these genre of films nowadays, which makes ""The Exorcist"" a genuine cinematographic masterpiece in this genre of movies. However, I understand that the author of the book upon which this movie is based got his idea for this story in 1950 and spent many years trying to get his book published without running into censorship. In any event, breakthrough books and movies are usually the ones that do the best. My mother told me that she was quite intrigued when she read the book to ""Rosemary's Baby"" in the early 1960s, because she had never come across any book like it back during that time period. I don't know what exact year the book to ""The Exorcist"" was published. I haven't had the occasion to read the book to this movie, but I have heard only good comments about it. However, I can say that whatever the book to this movie is like, if it strongly resembles the movie, it has to be a far cry from the conventional vampire or other scary books that may have been on the shelf at the time of its publication. As for the movie ""The Exorcist"", by 1973, people were ready for something different than Christopher Lee in vampire makeup or Vincent Price terrorizing his house guests in a creepy dark castle, and ""The Exorcist"" gave horror fans something new to digest. Hilariously enough, some people I know who saw ""The Exorcist"" said that they thought that it was a sincere account of a parent dealing with pre-teen hell with their daughter, who can be more terrifying than Linda Blair was in ""The Exorcist."" Oh, well. It was a good movie in either event.",

Everything is perfect; the pacing, the shots, the subtle ambient noises, the casting. It's literally flawless. I hate religion and a lot of the BS that goes with it, but it doesn't matter. This film is so well done (as is the book it's based on) that I can look past all of my anti-theisim and recognize a masterpiece. William Friedkin has done some other excellent things, but nothing as good as this. Blatty's another example of a person who can not only write great scripts and tele-plays, but can also pull a pretty darn good novel out of his posterior when needed. Max von Sydow is amazing in everything, and to think how much makeup they used to make him look that old, especially for a picture made in 1973 it's incredible.

It's not that Linda Blair got nominated for Oscar for best actress in a supporting role in the age of 15, nor the terrifying (but at the same time a bit ridiculous) scene that she walks down stairs upside down or the head spinning scene, but the fact that director William Friedkin builds up tension agonizingly slowly. It's one of those good old movies that didn't hurry up revealing everything right from the start like modern movies do, trying to scare you with all possible impressive but cheap tricks. The exorcist is mainly a psychological horror film (the most successful modern film that comes to my mind in that department is ""It Follows""). The slow but engaging progression of the possession, the step by step lose of faith by the priest and the emotional breakdown of the poor mother all are means to the end of engaging the spectator to the realm of the film. After that the final 5-10 minutes of the movie are just the shocking end that finishes the work. Like Rocky features the fight between the hero and Apollo Creed just in the final minutes of the movie, the exorcism itself actually lasts a few minutes and it's only a secondary part of the plot. All in all this one is a classic horror film that like ""Night of the Living Dead"" no one should have missed.",

760,4 November 1998,Darren-12,9, No Laughing Matter,"Much (too much?) has been written about this film so I'll restrict this review to my personal response only. It does have flaws: the opening sequence in Iraq, although beautiful to look at, is ultimately superfluous (although it obviously inspires the similar setting at the beginning of 'The Omen',  which is used with much greater relevance); the pacing is very uneven and the young priest couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. It makes up for its shortcomings with a superb performance from Ellen Burstyn as the mother and an unparalleled performance from Linda Blair as the girl. The final scenes of the exorcism are some of the most powerful ever put onto film (and MUST BE VIEWED ON A BIG SCREEN to appreciate their full impact). The film is harrowing rather than scary, with repeated visits into the girl's bedroom becoming just as full of dread for the audience as for the characters. The demon-possessed Linda Blair is one of the most memorable icons in cinema history. Still banned on video in the UK (mainly because of how young Linda Blair is than for any other reason), this is the only example of censorship of a mainstream film that I support. See the film and, for goodness sake, watch it with your disbelief suspended (sorry if this is stating the obvious, but there were people around me in the cinema laughing at various scenes when there is NOTHING REMOTELY FUNNY about what goes on). Finally, although I said I was going to keep this brief, this is roughly double the size of my average review for imdb and I've had intermittent goosebumps all the way through writing it.",

I had to force her because she never wanted to watch horror movie at night; however, we ended up finish the movie at around 3:30 am. After we finished the movie, she told me the movie is almost the same as what her grandmother described what an exorcism would look like. Since her grandmother is a devoted Christian, she is among the member of the most devoted Christians of her Church, and would be called to perform exorcism whenever the opportunity present itself. Moving objects in the room, long tongue, transfer of demon, are just some phenomenon her grandmother described. Different phenomenon occurs in different exorcism, it doesn't mean that these phenomena all present in single exorcism. Her grandmother also said that it's usually a group of people perform as exorcist, not just two persons.

771,2 October 2001,BobaFett-1,10, The One Hope. The Only Hope. The Exorcist,"Th Exorcist is probably the only hope to keep Horror alive! Granted there are some great old horror flicks (Halloween, Nightmare On Elm Street) and some new ones (Scream), but the horror genre now a days is in a huge mess -there is nothing scary anymore. But then the Exorcist was re-released, and released for the first time in over 15 years, in the UK. I have read some comments on people who say that The Exorcist is long and boring and rubbish - but I say to them, either it scared the hell out of you and you are too scared to watch it again, or that you are too stupid to be able to understand possibly one of the best horror/drama flicks of the 20th and possibly 21st Century. The Film is all about a real city (George Town), in a real street, with real people living in the street, and in a house, is a real girl, who happens to be possessed. After playing which a Ouiji board, Regan (Outstandingly played by Linda Blair) begins to act strange and demonic. Finally, when an exorcism is granted, Father Lancaster Merrin (Max Von Sydow) is called to cast out the evil spirit. Granted, the film may start off with no real point - but if you look at it properly, you will see the magic and points it makes. Many people say ""What's the Iraq sequence about?"" My answer is the head that Merrin breaks and cleans away from a piece of rock from a small cave, is the head of Pazuzu and so is the statue which he goes to see - these happen because after seeing the head he realises that Pazuzu is back (you see more of this in Exorcist 2 The Heretic and the forthcoming prequel, Exorcist Dominion). Basically the whole Iraq prologue is to do with Merrin knowing that something will happen and he will be called to deal with the situation, hence, why he has to leave Iraq. The Iraq sequence is easily understood if you really bother to get into the film and listen to what the people say in it. As for people saying ""Yeah but the whole film takes a long time to get into it's story"" My answer is that there is a party and all of the film making stuff, etc, at the beginning because this film is not your average horror flick, people who don't like the lengthy bits at the beginning obviously don't have any sense of the real world and would much rather watch the worse horror movies like Friday The 13th, Talisman, etc. I love the lengthy beginning because it helps to show that these are REAL people and how REAL people deal with things like this. As for people saying ""How the hell could she not remember?"" the answer is that the real life events of which this film (and supreme novel) is based the boy remembers nothing of his possession. This film is probably the most realistic horror/drama movie I have ever seen. People who say it is unrealistic obviously don't know what it is like to be in the real world -they seriously need to get a life and to get out more. This film is one of the best movies ever made and did shock the world when it was first released - it is much more scary then The Blair Witch Project (which was crap) and other films like that. William Peter Blatty's novel is the bets novel I have ever read, William Friedkin directs this movie beautifully (even if he did use methods that not all actors would like) he has done a supreme job on this. All of the actors did a great job as well (especially Fr Tom Bermingham and Fr William O'Malley who were cast in the film because they were priests). Linda Blair give the best child actor performance ever, and Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller (RIP), Max Von Sydow, Kitty Winn and the great Lee J. Cobb (RIP) all give great performances, as do the rest of the cast. Dick Smith and Marcel Vercoutere did brilliant jobs on SFX and Make-Up. I would also like to say that Mercede's McCambrige did beyond what any actress should do for a part - she was VERY committed to this project and if by far the most underrated actor in the whole movie (she did the demon voice), she is one of the best actresses ever! I also think that Eileen Dietz should have gotten more credit for her role. the Exorcist is a piece of art and will live on when Blair Witch, Friday 13th, etc, are all gone. Watch The Exorcist and you will know what a real movie is like!",

(The Exorcist), there is a lot of good publicity surrounding this film, and by good I mean people talking about how it is an evil film and how the film is not a thing that should be watching by anyone with any sort of faith. All of which leads to pretext that this is one scary horror movie.
Chris McNeal an actress who is at the peak of career is raising her daughter by herself. She has a lot of time for her daughter, her friends, her career but none for faith, as she is an atheist and has taught her daughter nothing that has to do with religion. She is happy living a good life with her daughter and making films until there is an intruder, someone that came to plague the innocence. It ravages this family to the bone as they try to expel the evil from their home. All while this taking place there is a young priest who is faced with a trail, a crisis of faith.
This was my favorite horror film for the longest time, it is only passed by (Alien) in my book. From the start of this film you are know that something is wrong going on as Max Von Sydow's character becomes frighten from an artifact that he has collected, this leads him to go find another artifact, that is when he is stricken with fear nodding that something awful might be headed this way. From then on out this movie is golden it gets you closer and closer to the edge of your seat with every scene. All of the acting in this movie was spectacular, I can feel every bit of the pain that is expressed by the characters in the movie. Linda Blair might not have been able to make those awful voices that the demon had but she did all of the acting it is so off putting throughout the film. There is a scene in which she is just sitting on her bed giggling with her hands up to her face that sent chills throughout my body. This movie hits every level that it looks to right on the head, it is perfect.
The imagery in this movie is golden, just letting it sit on some scenes, and then cutting away from some scenes. I know that that upset some people when it cut away from the scene when something insane happened, but I thought it was great it put the characters in such an awful position with nothing to do but take in what happen and we are given the same horror, we have to deal with the scene we just saw knowing that there was no real way to stop it. Along with that imagery came the music, the high pitched squeal that gets louder and louder. This has been used in so many horror movies and has just turned out to a just turned out to be a cheap jump scare. This movie gives nothing cheap and is all real horror from beginning to end. Costumes in the film are fine everyone is wearing clothes of the years it was made so it looks fine. One thing that this movie excelled with though is the practical effects the makeup on Regan along with the actions sometimes make you forget that this was once a little girl because all I could see on scene was a horrifying demon. Along with that there might be a scene or two where vomit is involved and it is so repulsive that I can feel the disgust of the actors.
There are a couple of messages I found to be very prominent in this film, first being that of faith. This film is very much faith affirming despite having the ""devil"" in about three fourths of the film. A man of God, a man who spends his time in worship is at a loss with his faith and doesn't know what to do this film brings him to a spot in which he must believe to succeed. To talk further work spoil the film but the ending confirms this theme even more. There is another part of the this film that I found a theme, it has to do with the the character Chris McNeal's profession as an actress. At first when watching this the only problem I had with the film was that I didn't understand why Chris was an actress or what it added to the story. However with having watched it 3 times in the past week I realized it has to do with everything. Chris is at the top of world she is high and mighty, when I think of people who are at the top of piles of money it is some actors and directors. So that is where she is sitting, then she has something awful happen, so she goes to a doctor and then another and another, all of the best in the world as money is of no issue, while all of this is happening, Father Karras is on the opposite end of that he is broke and is living somewhere very low end and when someone close to him becomes sick they are placed in an awful hospital that no one should ever be kept in but he has his faith. Chris does everything that she can with money but is eventually humbled when she realises that she can not buy he daughter out of what is going on and that she must also have faith to get what is best for Regan. Money is not everything.
When looking at the novel versus the book these two are about as close as they get. This is due to the author William Blatty being the screenplay writer of the film. He had taken writing classes but it is not that simple to transfer an entire novel to a two hour movie but it is done seamlessly. I happen to like the movie a bit more but that is because I am more naturally drawn towards movies as they are a passion for me.
This film is perfect for me as I have not been able to find any flaws. This is the pinnacle of horror films and it has earned all of the publicity that it has. This movie is not evil though it might be about it. On a scale of 1 to 10 this film gets a 10/10. It is perfect in my eyes and I suggest it to all those who do not mind the swearing.",

But my mom wouldn't let me because the movie freaked her out like no other, and she said that she still has nightmares from it. But that's only because she went to see it in theaters when she was 11, so no wonder it scared the living daylights out of her. Anyway, I begged her for a very long time and she finally let me see it. AHH! It's not so much a *scary* movie but all that got me freaked out of my mind was her face. I mean, seriously, how can anyone not find that creepy? Don't get me wrong...I love the movie and I would definitely see it again, but I understand why my mom didn't want me seeing it. It was on TV last night and I asked my mom if she would like to watch it with the rest of the family and to my amazement she said ""fine"" so we watched it as a ""family movie"" and she closed her eyes through half the film!

783,22 June 2003,What92691,10," The scariest horror film of all time, and most interesting horror film of all time","Horror films these days aren't interesting, all there is, is a guy with a mechede chasing after you trying to kill you. To many kills these days, and no scares is what I'm trying to point out. These days no horror films scare me at all, you have Jason Vorhees, and Freddy Krueger, they don't scare me, because in the movie they don't bring anything to reality. Instead this film brings the fact that you could get possessed by the devil to reality. It makes you think: ""Oh my gosh what if this happened to me,"" which never happens anymore. Another wonderful thing about this film is that it remains a commercially succesful film while also showing an interesting plot, and story. Everybody's acting, and actressing is fantastic in here. I couldn't believe that Linda Blair was actually playing the role, a little girl playing an evil spirit trapped inside of a body. I know the voices of her weren't real, but her, the faces, lip talking. The special effects were fantastic, they really make William Peter Blatty's novel come alive. I saw The Sting, and I thought this was much better than that, it kept you entertained, while The Sting was constantly boring. I'm not saying this should've won Best Picture, because to tell you the truth horror films aren't the academies style. While I'm a big fan of horror films, I know what's scary, and what isn't, and this is the ultimate scare. If you aren't a big fan of the horror film genre forget seing this because this is truly for horror film lovers. This movie should be looked back at horror films to come.

In the important scene of the short story that the man looks at the statue; the camera cuts to the man's face and zooms in after that the camera cuts to the statue and zooms in. Then, the audience can see the shot that they both stand in the opposite side with the weird of sound background(nondiegetic sound) that mixes with the sound of barking (offscreen sound). I think the director try to imply the audience that they both are going to encounter in some scene. In addition, the director uses ""a lap dissolve"" to connect between stories. Next, the plot of the movie follows with two story lines, and each story line meets each other in the middle of the movie. Moreover, the director uses the dream of the main actor to urge the expectation of the audience by connecting with the item(necklace) that was represented in the beginning of the movie. Finally, when the girl turn into evil, it looks very scary because the production designer did the good job for makeup.

This movie gives no chance to science and looked to me a real retrospective towards middle-age superstitions. It tends to cause deep confusion, in example, when one tries to figure out what the point was of showing off a powerful demonic entity refusing to telekinetically open a drawer or responding a question in Latin, but still so interested in using a defenseless child to create segregation among tumbling religious characters. If cheating devil is so smart, why does he waste time ridiculing a girl? Because he is so mean? Does he really need to prove it this way? Atheism is exposed as a weakness, not as a matter of choice, and the so-called possession is presented as an, <sigh>, undeniable fact: if you don't believe in it, then the whole movie concept is nothing!",

Although I *thought* I no longer believed in the boogey man, I soon found out I wasn't quite as sophisticated as I thought.  Since then, I've watched THE EXORCIST many times - it's still a well made movie.  It's a mistake to think this is simply a horror movie - it's a story about guilt, regret, courage, fear, loss of faith, maintaining faith when faced with God's inscrutable plan, etc.  Some interesting notes: some of the priests in the movie were in fact played by real-life priests; and Max von Sydow was only about 44 when he played Fr. Merrin, just 4 years older than actress Ellen Burstyn who played Regan's mother.  Also, The Exorcist was based on an actual incident that occurred in about 1948, but the characters and place settings were changed completely.  A made-for-TV movie that followed the actual events more closely (it was a boy, not a girl, who was possessed) recently aired.  Just one minor nitpick:  why was Fr. Karras a Catholic priest with an obvious Greek background when Greeks are virtually all of the Greek Orthodox religion?

799,14 June 2006,BeccaLeo,10, Without a doubt the scariest movie of all time.,"I attempted to view The Exorcist for the very first time on what turned out to be a worn out VHS copy from the video store. The soundtrack, picture were so bad that it was pointless to try and watch it. I would've rented the DVD but they did not have it at rental store. The re-release of the film a few years ago in theaters was my first real chance to see it. I sat in a packed auditorium with people ranging from late teens to 40 somethings. We were all scared to the core from the images presented in this film. I cannot comprehend how any normal god fearing human being could think this movie is laughable or a joke. I have been a horror film fan since i turned 8rys old in 1980. The Exorcist makes all the other horror films i have watched seem mild mannered. Almost everyone knows the story behind this movie and its basis in factual events. In real life it was a 14 yr old boy who was possessed while in the movie its a 13 yr old girl. Regan, as played by Linda Blair, is possessed by a demon because of her innocence,vulnerability,and insecurities. The opening of the movie takes place in Iraq where we meet Father Merrin on an archaeological dig. A member of his crew discovers a small/hand sized carving of an ancient,powerful evil. Father Merrin recognizes the carving as the likeness of a demon he fought decades prior as a young priest. He is terrified to the point to leaving the dig sooner than expected. Next is the set up for the circumstances by which Regan is possessed by the demon. The version with added scenes gives more insight into the intense frustration felt by Regan's mother Chris,played by Oscar winner Ellen Burstyn,as she continues to take Regan to one specialist after the next to get a medical or psychological explanation of what is happening to her daughter. In between doctor visits Regan becomes more violent,sadistic,and disfigured outwardly due to the demon's presence in her body. Finally, Chris seeks out the help of the Catholic Church,through a young priest/psychologist serving at the local university, to save her daughter and this pulls together all the horrific elements that lead to the exorcism of Regan. Father Merrin is called in by the younger priest, played by Jason Miller, to aid in the performing of the exorcism of Regan. Again this pulls the back-story into the present situation thus making it even more terrifying. Do not watch this film by yourself. Have one or more people with you and be prepared for the after affects of the film on your subconscious mind. Basically, you will more than likely have bad dreams over this movie. However, its an excellent horror/suspense/psychological film that set the standard very high for all other films of its nature that followed.",
800,27 October 2022,eagle-fox1,9, Still one of the top five scariest of all time,"Only the 2002 version of ""The Grudge"" and its sequel are scarier than the Exorcist. The reason why it is still considered the scariest is because no one in 1973, when it was released, had ever seen such special effects and true to life horror, especially the conversation with the demons. The flashback of his mother caused me to have tingles all over. When this movie was released, there were reported incidents of paramedics having to physically remove some movie patrons because they were paralyzed with fear, having had such a psychological shock, some of them had to be sent to a mental hospital for weeks and undergo treatment.

804,22 April 2018,brandonzamudio,6," Scary back then, but not now","This is an infamous film that's left a legacy of being imitated and proclaimed at one point and still by many as the scariest movie ever made. But not only is this movie not scary, it's boring and unintentionally hilarious. I know that people in the 70's had never seen anything like this before so I can somewhat understand why they'd enjoy this, but I've seen a lot of things and this movie tried its best to engage me and it never did. The first biggest problem is that it's a watershed film (a movie that's been imitated and copied), but unlike other similar films like Die Hard and Halloween that to this day yeah have elements that are familiar, still have enough creativity and enjoyment throughout to make them solid. This however poorly executes its ""creepy"" visuals, almost every time Reagan does something that's suppose to be disturbing, we never get time to let it sink in, instead as soon as something happens it cuts away to a scene where something completely separated is happening, it's like cutting away in the middle of an action sequence and than seeing the aftermath later, stupid. So the ideas don't hold up from being copied and not well executed, to the point where the demon came off more like a 12 year old kid yelling online about video games or something, just ridiculous. Now the extra salt on the wound is the fact that the second problem is its length, this 2 hour movie has one scene after another that just drags on for so long with characters taking forever to get to the dang point already, so the movie wastes your time through its majority runtime and the parts where a little time should be spent to really get involved in the scenes, they cut away from it immediately. And you can say it's well made and well acted or whatever but that only goes so far, I'm not ever angry at people who definitely put time and effort into the things that they make. And yeah the effects are still great but none of it matters when the movie did such a poor job at having me care about anyone, the detective didn't need to be in the movie, the mom didn't need to be in the movie (heck if Reagan was an orphan it really wouldn't have made much of a difference overall since the mom didn't do much other than worry), the one priests mother didn't need to be there. Scene after scene of them trying to figure out with what's wrong with her, when we as the audience already know, this isn't a mystery story so why is it trying to be. She should've been almost fully possessed and getting worked on by the two priests by like 20-30 minutes in. Than have some maybe rivalry like tension between the priest with one doing things differently from the other, that would have been way more interesting and well executed. But no she instead gets possessed almost 3/4 of the way through, up until then you feel like the movie is just wasting your time, and when she is possessed (which by the way isn't a spoiler it's the premise of the movie) there's only about 10-15 minutes of it, and it's not scary in the slightest, none of it it's just hilarious because like I said she's acting like a spoiled kid throwing a temper tantrum.

I give it a 10 as the greatest horror movie I have ever seen. Wish the sequel would of been a haunted house type thing of someone moving into the house where the exorcism was done and having odd visons. I think that would of been cool. But maybe some movies of course are probably left better as one original and done. ,

I have teased others for doing this and it was the only movie that forced me to. I felt scared after I watched it, as if I had seen something I shouldn't have, something evil and sinful. It's the scariest movie of all time, hands down. What makes it scary is how the story is told and the idea that something like this could happen. There have been reports of this kind of thing in the past and there really are priests in the Catholic church that specialize in this sort of thing.",

And mockery from those that have an eye for effects and think that green vomit is unacceptable as SFX. For some people it might evoke a bit of everything. Yet, despite all the different reactions (and because of them) it has given rise to eternal debates, theological conversations, has changed the course of horror cinema (and direction) and, to the day, is the only film that has managed to threaten the human psyche to such a degree, either causing people to faint, vomit and miscarry, or democratic 'secular' states banning it for 25 years.

Plus a couple of school pals of mine had managed to sneak their way into the theater, saw it, and were blown away by it. So it is that I've always shunned it, even though I love good horror movies. But this one sounded like it was just too much... I watched it for the first time in my life in full last week. The sounds coming out of Reagan are the single frightful element for me. Nothing else at all scared me the slightest and lingered on thereafter in my mind - and I'm impressionable with this kind of stuff!
Most recent naysayers here (the lower votes) summarize the problems with the screenplay and characterization much better than I would.
Reagan is improbable and goes from something too sweet in her normal condition to the very extreme, which looks too much like the more violent tantrums of a spoiled and pampered child...
The makeup job is overdone and poorly used - usually with too much light in the room.
Lots and lots of noise... (And what really is less scary than loud noise?)
""It's the rats""... Really, almost laughably silly! Softer noises in the attic growing in intensity but with subtelty would have been so much more efficient...
Finally, I never got the ""Tubular Bells"" tune as used for this film. They should have stuck with the other modern classical composers (Webern, Penderecki...) employed elsewhere.",
831,11 May 2014,nibiruorr,9, The Devil's in the details.,"The story goes that future Hollywood scribe Blatty while a student attending the Jesuit University at Georgetown back in 1949, came across a curious item in the Washington Post involving a 14 year old Mt. Rainier youth plagued by demons, not the psychological or drug-addled kind but the bona fide supernatural variety, undergoing the ancient ritual of exorcism (the casting out of said demons). Flash-forward after years of paying his dues in Hollywood, Blatty would later base certain aspects of the incident mostly entailing the ritual and cant involved as the basis for his runaway bestseller ""The Exorcist"". Oscar winning filmmaker Friedkin (""The French Connection"") realized it as the perfect follow up as he was on a winning streak, and, the rest, as they say, is cinema history. It was certainly a blockbuster when it premiered in 1973 and has earned its reputation as the scariest movie ever made over the years. Those unseen forces and invisible agencies for both good and evil notwithstanding, it's also quality filmmaking. The effects by Marcel Vercoutere are more mechanical in nature rather than those effects involving traveling mattes, matte art, etc. but are no less compelling in its depiction of bilious graphic horror (a later reissue was retouched using a few digital effects) and the demonic makeup by Dick Smith goes beyond grotesque, it's downright sickening. Not to mention, language so strong it would make David Mamet shrivel up in a corner and die. But it was those powerful four letter invectives along with other aspects of the script that won Blatty his coveted Oscar for Best Screenplay.",

While The Exorcist is a horror classic, the best things about it aren't the scares, it's the characters, the themes, and the atmosphere. The film got me to care a lot for the characters. In particular, Jason Miller's Father Karras and Ellen Burstyn's Chris MacNeil, who gave some of the best performances in the film. Linda Blair gave one of the best performances by a child actor ever as Regan. I totally bought into her as this possessed person. The themes about faith presented in the film are thought-provoking, to say the least. The cinematography gives this film a cold feel that after the opening, never leaves the room. The music is iconic, the practical effects and special effects are some of the best in horror. Everything leading up to the exorcism in the third act helps to build tension and a feeling of worry for the characters.

However, The Exorcist had me shaking in my boots. I was in a motionless trance throughout the entire 122 minutes of this terrifying work of horror magic. I was actually afraid of watching this in the dark. The way in which the demon(s) take an ever intensifying hold on Regan's body and being as time went on was gritty and traumatizing, and adds a spiritually dark aspect to this movie's theme. The acting was incredible and I love how the study of the two priests shows the struggles and situations of the two men beyond their task of just performing an exorcism toward the end of the film. And the poor mother! I felt like I was onboard the emotional rollercoaster she was riding the whole time.

Even 25 years after its original opening, references to projectile vomiting or someone turning their head all the way around immediately recall this movie.  So, when I finally sat down to watch this film, I had high expectations.  Sadly, these expectations were not met. The effects were very well done, and the movie was quite scary in places (more so than silly slasher flicks like ""Friday the 13th"", anyway), but the plot and character development left much to be desired.  Ellen Burstyn's character, the mother of the possessed girl, is one-dimensional at best, and is frequently very annoying, while Max von Sydow's Father Merrin seems almost totally undeveloped despite spending a fair amount of time on the screen.  The only human character with any interesting development at all is Jason Miller's Father Karras.  The most important character, though, and the one whose development is perhaps most lacking, is the Devil himself. He possesses this little girl, and does all sorts of disgusting and violent things with her, but his motives in doing so are totally unexplained.  In this regard, the climax of the film also seems terribly silly.  Frankly, if the sort of stuff shown in this film is the best that the Devil can do, I wouldn't be too terribly scared of him.",

This is usually met with a shocked reaction and then questions as to 'Why?' and 'You like horror movies then'?. Well no I don't actually like many horror movies as the plot and acting are usually non existent and the dialogue is like something a 6 year old will write. So let me take you back to the early 70s when I was a kid and my 11 year older sister went to the cinema to see The Excorcist. She slept with a crucifix under her pillow for months. Forward to the 80s and The Excorcist was released on video. I and my school friends sat round our TV and Betamax video recorder, curtains closed and watched the then infamous Excorcist. I must put some substance to this in that I had previously watched many horror movies, none of which really scared me, so it was with bible clutched that I watched. In awe. And that is how I can describe this movie to people that don't know it. Its AWESOME. And you know what? It's NOT a horror movie. Nothing happens for at least 1 hour (more if you watch the recommended uncut version). What makes this movie special is a number of things: Ellen Burstyn's portrayal of Chris is truly believable. She genuinely looks like she is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. There is a sub plot running that most people miss. This is a Whodunnit on a grand scale. Is she possessed? Only her mum, who is recently divorced and feels guilty about it sees anything. Only Damien, who has lost his mum and blames himself and is losing his faith sees anything. Only Lancaster Merin, an old frail ill priest that has a back story that nearly cost him his life and job sees anything. Carl the butler? Burk accuses him of being a NAZI. In all this madness are we really supposed to believe that Regan is possessed when all around her are having problems. Watch this movie without believing the hype about the scariest movie ever. It isn't ( That title might go to the first Nightmare). Its a drama with 1st class acting, amazing story, multiple sub plots and amazing effects (No CGI!). A masterpiece.",

847,7 January 2016,mpdmartin,10, One of the best films ever made,"The Exorcist (1973) Reviewed by Martin Davis, Retrospect Film on Facebook. Over forty years since its initial release, William Friedkins' adaptation of William Peter Blattys' novel of the same name remains one of the most powerful and thought provoking films ever made. Based on actual events 'The Exorcist' tells the story of the demonic possession of a twelve year old girl, Regan MacNeil, played, in a remarkable performance, by Linda Blair. Opening, with scenes of an archaeological dig in northern Iraq, Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) finds an amulet resembling the statue of Pazuzu, a demon he had defeated years earlier, Merrin realises the demon has returned to seek revenge. The scene quickly shifts to Georgetown, where single parent Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is balancing a busy acting career with bringing up her daughter Regan. We are also introduced to Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller), a young priest who is struggling with doubts about his faith. One night, after playing with a Ouija board, Regans behaviour suddenly changes. From an initial strangeness, it soon escalates into something far more violent and disturbing. Having exhausted all medical avenues, Chris MacNeil turns in desperation, to the Catholic church. Confiding in Karras that she believes her daughter is responsible for the death of her friend and film director, Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran), he agrees to help. With the churches' blessing, the exorcism will be performed by Father Merrin, with Father Karras assisting. Arriving at the house, Merrin is left in no doubt he is there to do final battle with Pazuzu. With the exception of veteran actors, von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb as investigating police detective, Lieutenant William F. Kinderman, the cast were, at the time, relatively unknown and the film has several notable performances. From Ellen Burstyns increasingly distraught mother to Jason Millers priest, burdened with anguish by his loss of faith and guilt over the circumstances of his own mothers passing to Linda Blair as Regan. Despite scenes and dialogue that are still shocking today, 'The Exorcist' is, at heart, a deeply moral film. Good can triumph over evil, even if it sometimes comes at a terrible price. Not a horror classic. Just a classic. Martin Davis, Retrospect Film on Facebook.",

Because its antagonist is the evil our American Puritan society fears most. Because it's the granddaddy, the original, that's been duplicated again and again many decades after. Because it plays like a documentary, dragging the audience into a bedroom it doesn't want to walk into. Because it holds so many realistic performances, including the treasured scene-stealing by preteen Linda Blair, and Ellen Burstyn doing a great Shirley MacLaine impression before even Shirley herself could master it... not to mention real-life priests in bit parts, a playwright showing marvelous vulnerability, and a legendary Swedish actor who can't stop playing old men (no matter what his age is).

If you really want to see a good horror-film, look at Nosferatu, the first Draculafilm and still the best. The Exorcist is a horribly failed metaphor. It should say something about evil in everyone of us, but this is completely overshadowed by the worst cinematography, storyline and acting I've ever seen. Max von Sydow, after working with the great Bergman, should be deeply ashamed to have taken part in this crusade of failure. I'll probably never understand why this is the 'scariest movie ever'. I really had to try hard not to fall asleep. Don't watch it. A pure waste of time.",

I wouldn't mind watching this again for 4 or 5 times. I recommend it to anyone who truly loves the Horror/Thriller genre.

You need to be on top of the Evil thats all around us (sounds easy but it is not). The Movie explains this all in detail... To be good is not easy... like we can see in all the characters .. as they struggle through life... Like ourselves ... the Evil comes and want to take you ... and you struggle too ... don't give up this struggle as the good normally wins ... This Movie is an Analogy of Life itself ... Don't get caught by the Evil !!! Be aware and protect yourself ... I recommend this Movie to everyone that is uncertain ! After THIS .... you wont be uncertain anymore :) Great Story and great acting of everyone ! A true Masterpiece by Friedkin ! I am not a religious person but this Movie makes you think of so many levels that it sounds like you are a priest. Recommended 100 %%%,

872,30 November 2005,paul_bowes2003,6, Landmark film greatly weakened by the passage of time,"I won't bother to repeat what others have said about the impact of this film in its time. Some of the things that were strengths then are still strengths now. 'The Exorcist' was one of the first films of supernatural terror to feature a committed cast of first-rate professional actors and a very strong script that took its story seriously. Friedkin's direction, the relatively slow pace, and the clarity and restraint of the cinematography and almost subliminal soundtrack work as well as they ever did. For example, Friedkin makes effective use of silence and very quiet sounds instead of smothering everything in the pounding rock soundtrack that has since become the norm. The special effects, however, are primitive and largely unconvincing, and many of the most 'horrific' moments simply don't work for an audience conditioned to a far higher standard of realism. (For this viewer, thirty years on, some of the most frightening things in the film were items of Ellen Burstyn's wardrobe.)",
873,12 May 2017,seeleyal,6," Good, at best","I went into this film with high hopes. However, it did not live up to the hype for me. In fact, I often found it to be predictable and lack-luster. However, the film was still very well made and does a very good job of slowly building up the action. I found myself questioning if I was watching the right movie throughout the entire opening sequence of it because it seemed to be totally unrelated. There is a clever use of dialogue in this film in the sense that they carefully choose when would be appropriate to stick a music track in rather than drowning all of the dialogue in music. The cinematography itself was very modern in feel and had me forgetting that I was watching an older movie quite a few times. It does still have that ""old movie"" feel to it though which I believe is very appealing. However, the artistic form that it this movie has a hard time making up for the predictable, boring plot.

Everything is good form the camera work to the make-up (which really was something else for a film as old as it is). I must admit that i watched the film with some caution since i knew that it had caused some people emotional distress in the past.  But I was impressed with everything about it. This film WAS one of the scariest movies around (at it's time), but since then we have seen films such as clockwork orange, silence of the lambs and Hannibal which have almost matched it.  Although i'm sure the film was incredibly scary in the atmospheric cinema on a 14 inch T.V it really wasn't that scary. But none the less this is a great film to see and i was particularly impressed with the girls acting in the film. This film was also based on a true story (although it was eggadurated A LOT) in the 1930's in New York a boy was said to have been possessed by the devil and witnesses said his voice and moods changed dramtically, in this case an Exorcist was called (but the amount of truth in that story is debatable). but bottom line is that this film is a work of genuis and is a must see, and don't be put off by it's reputation.",

Probably more disturbing than scary it focuses on the demonic possesion of a young girl. Where normally a slow build up is not in a movie's best interest, in this case its the slow build up which adds to the tension and anxiety of the viewer. Its more a case of you know something bad is going to happen and even though you think you are prepared for it, the sheer disturbing nature of watching a young girl act and look so horrible is something you can never forget. Not something you can watch too many times but it certainly makes you take a stand in your faith or lack of and is a one of a kind film.",

I went to see this at the movies.  I must say that the language at times was disturbing.  But the craziest part that was included in this movie that wasn't included in the 1973 version was when Linda Blair was crawling down the stairs in a back-stand manner, with blood poring out of her mouth. One word:  FREAKY!!  I wanted to see that again, but of course, there was no rewind.  Other stuff that was added was mostly medical tests that were performed on her.  I think the devil statue idea was lame.  The ending was quick and disappointing.  That thing killed two priests, and all the jibber jabber they did to try and exorcise this girl didn't work.  The only thing that worked is a priest beating the H E double L out of this girl and telling the devil to go into him instead, which ""they"" obeyed and did so, thus saving this girl from death.

886,9 September 2020,andfloy,5," Very Overrated, But Terrifying! SPOILERS","Okay, so I want to say I'm looking at this movie very objectively. There are soooo many ratings of 9 and 10 for this movie which I suspect is because it's a classic and people love the way that it changed horror films and even cinema in general, which it undoubtedly did. HOWEVER, while it was a good movie, there is no way I could give it a 9 rating because objectively as a film it just isn't at that level. I think it was about a 6 because even though the storyline was very imaginative and compelling (even offensive at times) there were a whole lot of moments where I found myself thinking ""why in the world did they do that??"" because of a choice in editing, character development, story development, or just a weird mistake. For starters, why are the first 10:30 minutes in Iraq? I get that they wanted to show that the priest's exorcism experience stayed with him wherever he was and they did a good job of that, but why was it so long and monotonous? 10:30 isnt a long time normally, but it is when it's the very beginning impression of the movie and goes over a couple lines of dialogue and watching a man look shocked. Also, one thing that really brought me out of the movie was how obvious it was that they sped up the footage of the men digging and the boy running to tell the priest he found something. I know they did that sometimes in movies to make it move faster or even in newer films like Fury Road to give a feeling on tension and suspense, but this was literally a kid running a little bit, so why would you speed that up? There's a ridiculously long scene of the priest walking slowly through the streets afterwards just to show that he's disturbed. The change of pace is very awkward and it makes the choice to speed up the playback make NO SENSE. Another part of the beginning that was weird was the finding of the buried head of the demon. It was very emphasized at the beginning and I kept expecting it to come up later on but it turns out that while the coin was important the specific head wasn't important at all, it just reminded him that the devil existed. Why was that so shocking to him, was he not expecting to find any sort of religious artifacts that could remind him of demons at an archaeological site of an ancient city? And why did he go all the way out to that statue of the demon at the other cite? They did a great job building suspense and mystery, like ""oh why is he going to the other cite? Was this artifact significant in some way like something he had been looking for?"" But I felt very let down when it was literally just because the guy wanted to look at a bigger version of what he found. Why was that so shocking? He drove there yes but it seemed to be in a nearby digging cite, so they could have had the same religion. Why did he need to look at the bigger statue? And why did that mean at all that he should go back to the U.S? Those were the problems I had with the first 10:30 minutes of the movie and thing like that kept happening with no explanation. And I know that it's a very old movie and that I have to give it some slack for that, but I feel like giving a 6 is cutting it quite a bit of slack considering how many there were throughout the movie. To explain, some of the other big things that jumped out in the rest of the movie:",

For me I don't find this kind of thing scary but I enjoy it a lot. Basicly the book and film can be divided into sections. The intro, the beginning of the happenings, the doctors visits,tests and medication, calling Father Karras in and then the exorcism and finishing up. The book, one of my most read, compares favourably with the film for accuracy and I really think that you should give both a try unless you are particularly squemish.

892,1 October 2002,Phill-13,10, This film will scare the Hell out of you....,"This film will scare the Hell out of you and the Heaven into you... literally...if you have been brought up as religious as I was. (I am a Catholic right from the cradle and am a former Alter Boy.) If you are religious it will frighten you as it did me. If not, that's okay, too and you'll find it an entertaining entry in the ""demonic possession,"" genre. The film, allegedly based on facts, (that alone made it seem even more frightening at the time of its release) was calculated to keep your stomach in knots and to give you goose pimples as large as the measles or chicken pox all over your body from start to finish, and it succeeds in every way due to the direction, art, staging, and acting of the principals involved. If you do watch it, you'll be riveted to your seat throughout this film as my friend and I were. It all starts as a childish game of playing with an Oui-Ja board, through which little Regan (Blair) accidentally conjures up the devil (an altogether real possibility while playing with Oui-Ja boards) and subsequently becomes possessed by the devil (also a real possibility, because that's, allegedly, how the actual child came to be possessed in real-life, inspiring the book and subsequent film). After all Hell breaks loose in the house, Regan's mother (Burstyn) takes her to a local church, and the pastor calls in the Exorcist (von Sydow) to (hopefully) save her daughter. Will he succeed or will the devil kill little Regan and drag her soul to Hell? Watch and find out. At the time of its release, the film was billed as the most frightening film ever made, and it was. (You gotta remember...this was the early '70s when censorship was still going strong and films didn't show much on-screen, nor did they infer very much in the dialog, either except in ""X-rated"" films, which this wasn't. It was ""only"" rated ""R"".)    If you watch this film, don't do it alone. I watched this film in 1973 at the age of 17 at a local theater with a friend (a fellow Alter Boy like myself) when it was first released because our local church banned it (or, rather us Catholics from watching it) and we wanted to see what all of the fuss was about. Anyway, at the theater, they were handing out sickness bags at the door, which I think, but am not sure, was a gag, intended to frighten us even more. Gag or not,it sure frightened us, alright.

This stands as the greatest movie theater experience of my life (barring a Texas Chainsaw Massacre or 2001 Space Odyssey Re-Release). The plot isn't as terrifying for non- strict Catholics I guess, but this is still a great film. Every single frame in the movie is visually spine-chilling. Even the scene where Father Karras is running on the track has no in-the-face cursing or demonizing, but just the scene itself is cold and creepy. THe whole movie has that 'cold' feeling. (I urge anyone with the DVD and a good sized TV to turn out all the lights, and turn off your heat in the winter time. curl up in a blanket and watch this film.) Most people trash this as cheesy and laughable, but if you just see it as a visual piece of art you'll be impressed. I never really believed I or someone will be possessed, but I will honestly say I have had a nightmare about that devil face they show for a split second 3 times during the film.

Its powerful, as I said it makes you think. But its also powerful because you begin to feel the guilt that Father Karras feels about his mother and when the demon speaks in his mothers voice and says 'Why did you do this to me Dimmy?' really gets to you. They really did choose the soundtrack well as well, Tubular Bells is one of my favourite albums and it works brilliantly in this film. Apart from that this song doesn't actually have much music, but I think that works well. It makes it seem more realistic unlike most modern films. Another thing that I love about this film is the In Your Face scenes. They just time it so well. One minute its quiet and nothings happening then it just explodes in your face.",

The sequel (and prequel) just didn't have the wholesome gist of original. Blame me for dramatic,but this movie stood out on its own permanently. ",

The plot is great and the possessed girl looks scary except the demon or ghost (it doesn't seem scary to me). My only problem with this movie is they talk too much.",
902,21 June 2005,smendoza91,10, Scariest movie of all time!,"I think THE EXORCIST is the scariest movie of all time cuz it scared the hell out me and I watched it at 10 'o clock at night which made it even scarier. I saw it with my whole family where I thought it wasn't gonna be that scary but BIG MISTAKE I couldn't fall asleep that night I just coudn't stop thinking about spider-walk scene with blood on her mouth, masturbating herself with the cross, the head spinning scene and last the exorcism parts of where it was so creepy!",

904,9 May 2009,s-price476,9, Still Powerful and Still Masterful.,"The Exorcist, quite simply is a masterpiece in film making. For those expecting a horror movie with jolts, shocks and scary gimmicks, will be disappointed, however those seeing the movie on original release would've been alarmed. This is an intelligent piece of cinema that has stood the test of time and the only thing that slightly betrays this are some of the effects have aged. That said the direction is flawless as is the acting-very strong performances from all, giving a credibility to all the hokum.",
905,16 August 2002,DarkFire639,10, One of the Five Definitive Horror Films,"The Exorcist, in my opinion, is one of the best films ever made. And is #2 on my top five list of most influential horror movies. The Exorcist crossed a line in 1973. The movie has a young girl uttering almost every foul word in the English language, masturbating with a cross, killing full grown men, urinating in front of a group of adults, and throwing up on a priest. This movie, being the first R-Rated one I saw, effected me like no other. The first time I saw it, I truthfully can say that I wasn't scared, although repeated viewings proved otherwise. I was mystified by the fact that these images were allowed to be shown in the United States. Now, years later after seeing such films as ""Happiness"", ""Pink Flamingos"", and ""The Evil Dead"", The Exorcist doesn't seem as bad, but the punch is still there everytime I watch it. It is my favorite movie of all time and #2 on my list of influential horror films. I recommend it to anyone who wants to be truly scared, horrified, and repulsed all in about 2 hours.",
906,6 September 2009,shaw-simon,10," ""Did You See What She Did, Your @*&^$!* Daughter?!""","I remember seeing this when it was re-shown in British cinemas as its ban was lifted in 1999. 'The Scariest Movie Ever Made' is a formidable reputation and naturally, I couldn't wait to see it on the big screen. The cinema was at capacity, most were probably less interested in good horror and more curious in the film's dubious infamy. I had anticipated an audience jumping from their seats, shrieks from flabbergasted adults who could barely contain themselves in a some petrified stupor! Pop corn leaping from trembling hands and perhaps even a walk-out or two. What actually happened was laughter. Thats how a modern audience, fed on CGI laden garbage treats a horror classic? Personally, I think The Exorcist has aged beautifully. The script, cast and story all have a depth and quality that just doesn't date. And whilst the head-spinning, projectile vomiting, crotch grabbing moments of the film may not shock as they once did; there is an atmosphere to this movie, a feeling like an evil dog is off its leash and could do anything. The opening scene in the Middle East just has an indescribable un-easiness to it.",
907,4 November 2021,agustinernestojr,3, Talking too much and boring scenes,I was excited to watch this movie with my nephew and this movie turned out to be a disappointment because they talk too much. The story is great and the possessed girl looks scary except for the ghost or demon. My nephew actually fell asleep watching this movie because of the talking scenes.,
908,27 November 2012,steven-anthoni-507-550816,8," The ""Real"" Horror Movie","I saw this movie last week. I like this movie. The plot and sound in this movie are really amazing. Many horror movies always made their audience shocking because the sound effect or the ghost appears suddenly, but The Exorcist is very different. It didn't have any kinds of scene that can make any shock. This movie is really ""horror movie"" because many scenes showed how the demon possessed Regan's body make many peoples scared and he also killed two people. He also could make the young priest confused and he successfully influenced him because of his mother. The ending of this movie is unpredictable because I think father Merrin who can solve the problems but in fact isn't him. This movie in recommended if you want to watch horror movie without shocks.",
909,7 September 2019,bbmisa,1, One of the worst horror movies I've seen so far,Extremely boring and very slow paced. There are unnecessary moments which just drag the movie for no reason.,
910,10 December 2019,shanemb95,9, My thoughts,"The exorcist remains to be one of my favorite horror movies. Unlike some of the others, that tell a story that could never happen, the exorcist can be very real to those who possess a religious belief. That being said, this film really hit home and will possibly go down as one of the best horror films ever made.",
911,4 October 2020,pmtaran,10, I rate this title a 10 exclusively on its merits of horror,"I had to see this film because of all the word of mouth I heard growing up. When I finally saw it I thought it was one of most disturbing, blood curling films I've ever seen. I don't know if I have the stomach to ever rewatch it, and I usually prefer to watch horror films around Halloween, whether I've seen them or not. If you're looking for horror on a darker level, watch this film.",
912,5 November 1998,Vipi,9, The Devil's best chase,"As a movie fan I am , I can say that this movie is the best of its type. Can not be compared with others. I still see it every now and then in T.V. , and keep thinking how extraordinarily good it was filmed and directed. And about the plot, even the most sceptic could fall for it. A movie to be appreciated from the beginning to the end. Viewers are chased by the evil's presence.....!",
913,29 October 2019,millet-08844,10, A Hard-Hitting Cinematic Landmark,"When this award-winning film was released in the early 1970's, it's hard to imagine how audiences must have responded. It took a truly vicious approach to storytelling, and a big part of its success came from the well-developed characters: something the vast majority of horror movies rarely have these days. When things take a turn for the worse, thanks to the fact that we care about these characters, the impact is just as brutal and powerful as ever.",
914,19 September 2008,Mariano_Anderson,9, Boo!,"Everybody talks about how scary this movie is. It didn't scare me. Everybody talks about faith. I have none. Everybody talks about how it makes you THINK! Think about WHAT??? It's a good flick, in its day it was a great one. I avoid horror movies like the plague. I've only seen 2 others. ""The Omen"" (suckered into it by my liking for Gregory Peck, it upset the hell out of me, god had nothing to do with it, it was things like people getting their head cut off! I've hated Gregory Peck (""Arabesque,"" ""Moby Dick"" and all) ever since) and ""The Revenge of Frankenstein"" which I saw when I was 10 years old and was in a state of terror and horror for days afterwards. These were trash. ""The Exorcist"" had some class. But it's well to remember that this is nothing but a movie. It is not a documentary of science failing and religion saving the day. It is a movie! It's not the holy grail. It's not even holy. Except the little rows of punched out squares along either side of the celluloid.",
915,18 September 2000,nlloyd33,10, Very scary!,"My mom would never let me see this movie. So when I was about 12 or 13 I watched it at my Grandmas house. I was really suprised at how disturbing it was. The noises are great, and the special effects are really cool. The head spinning around all the way, and pea soup scenes are gross. I'm really looking forward to seeing it in the theater. rated R-language, disturbing and violent images, sexual content.",
916,10 April 2001,Philip Crowther 2001,9," modern classic, milestone, masterpiece and must-see","The Exorcist is a classic, and a modern one at that. So what's a `Modern Classic'? How about this: a landmark work of art that stands the test of time and is immune to criticism, from generation to generation. That, at least, was what I thought until I saw the re-release in the company of a typical weekend multiplex audience. Even a masterpiece like The Exorcist clearly needs to be watched with the historical context in mind. How else is it possible to explain the audience's laughter at the film's most disturbing and shocking scenes? (A generation ago, audiences were fainting en masse.) Admittedly, the film was made in the Middle Ages  or was it only 30 years ago?  and the effects (the revolving head, say, or the strange spider-walk down the stairs), though pretty special at the time, do not bear comparison with present-day computer-generated imagery. (Anyone who went to see Dungeons & Dragons might beg to differ!) But The Exorcist is still one of the best and scariest (horror) films ever made. Maybe the giggles served only to mask the nervousness or tension that such an effective movie can create, and not just among the more faint-hearted members of a cinema audience.",
917,14 May 2001,JamesEGuidry,10," 3 decades standing,still the Scariest of all time!!!","The undesputed scariest movie of all time!Even if the religious implications don't scare the ""Hell"" out of you,the special effects and incredible sound tracks will invade your mind and never leave! I mean,we've all had a relative flip out before,but Come On!!!! We've all heard of one-hit wonders,but Linda Blair gets my vote for that one-time glance that you NEVER forget(from the front AND back!) The EXORCIST- the scariest movie of ALL TIME!!!!!!!!",

A beautifully casted horror with inspring special effects, production and brutal direction (watch the documentary). 47 years old and it still delivers a powerful punch with strategically loud and gritty scares which shock you in to wanting more. A classic and timeless possession film which set the standard for all that followed it.",
919,16 January 2002,HybridNumber1,10, A must see for all seeking a scare!!!!!!!!,When I saw the exorcist it was in a dark room w/ my father. I was not ready for extreme fright that was going to overwhelm me and almost change the way i thought forever. There was a big controversy on this movie in that many people found it went against their religion. I recommend this to all who seek to be scared or changed.,
920,24 February 2002,jlb5947,9," Not scary, but good movie","I saw The Exorcist today for the first time because I wanted to see what everyone was so scared of.  Before I even watched this movie, I knew it wasn't going to bother me.  I laughed through most of it. First of all, I am a very devout Christian so I know how Satan can be.  So when I saw this movie, I wasn't scared of anything I saw because I am not afraid of the Devil and no one else should be either. But to be totally honest, I'm a little bit more reluctant of movie plots that can't possibly happen in real life.  For example, take Freddy Krueger.  Till this day, The Nightmare on Elm Street movies still make me flinch.  But movies that involve demon possessions don't bother me because I know that stuff happens-look in the Bible for goodness sakes.  I know some people say there is no such thing as the devil.  For all you science buffs out there, you may believe there isn't. But some people like to look at evil actions from a science and spiritual point of view.",
921,31 October 2014,JamesSaintRave,10, The best film ever made that will scare the devil out of you,"It is amazing that The Exorcist is still by far the scariest horror film ever released--over 40 years after it's legendary shocking release. The timeless frightful aspects of the film will always stand up, probably because most people on our earth have a fear of the afterlife, the devil and his hell, the power of faith and it's questionable ability to help us in our time of need, and even life itself and what we cannot control in it. The film, as well as the book it is based on taps into every one of these fears quite meticulously, little by little, while developing it's characters fully so that we understand them, give a damn about them--even the deleted role of Lee J Cobb as Lt. Kinderman comes off as a fully developed character with only a few minutes of screen time--the mark of a brilliant writer (William Peter Blatty, who adapted his novel) and director (William Friedkin, his first film after his Oscar-winning work on The French Connection) working with a perfect cast (Ellen Burstyn as Chris McNeil was at her peak and Jason Miller as Father Karris never again demonstrated his power as an actor in film after this role. But it was newcomer Linda Blair as the possessed Regan that was a true ""godsend""--like she said in her acceptance speech after winning a Golden Globe award for her amazing performance--""What can I say? The devil made me do it!"") Most so-called ""horror"" films these days are amateurish--you will get more scares at Halloween by visiting your neighborhood spook house. But watching The Exorcist will scare the devil out of you, probably give you nightmares, and stick in your mind as the ultimate horror story for the rest of your life. Do you dare take this ride? You should--because this one will frighten you for sure but leave you with an ultimate appreciation for life and all it's scary parts.",

Others weren't so lucky.  I love to be scared and was never more terrified than I was by William Friedkin's images here. Anytime the camera zoomed down the hallway to Regan's  room, I was horrified.  Great music by Mike Oldfield, great book by William Peter Blatty.  Fantastic movie, I watch it every Halloween.  The TBS version is a complete joke.  Buy the DVD.",
923,21 January 2007,smeisky,10," Not scary, but otherwise brilliant.","First, I'm just going to come right out and say it - this movie did not scare me at all. I don't know if it was because I have an unusually high threshold for grossness, or because I knew about most of the scary scenes in advance, or because I find the concept of organized religions laughable, but for whatever reason, this movie, touted as one of the most terrifying ever made by just about everyone, did not scare me.",
