0,21 February 2006,gavin6942,10, Pure Bloody Genius,"Guy Ritchie has a skill: the skill to take multi-layered gangster plots, weave them together, and come out with a fabric of the finest quality. I first watched ""Snatch"", which came after this film. Loved it. Watch this film, which had a similar set-up (the interwoven gangster theme). Loved it. As far as I'm concerned, if Ritchie can maintain this level of creativity, he can keep on making these films until the end of time. His characters are so well scripted and the actors so well chosen, there is a three-dimensional quality to this film, as if you can almost taste the sulfur in the shotgun blasts.",/

2,23 December 2007,brando647,8, Guy Ritchie's Hilarious Feature Debut,"This is one seriously funny movie. I've probably seen it close to 10 times and it hasn't gotten old yet. Guy Ritchie brings us a hilarious look into the London criminal underground in one of his earliest features. The story revolves around four friends who become indebted to the local crime lord after a card game goes horribly wrong. The humor in this movie is sharp and fast-paced. At times, it becomes a little hard to keep up with the thick British accents and the cockney rhyming slang but overall, it doesn't detract from the movie. The movie keeps you guessing as to the outcome when the story becomes complex with multiple lies and double-crosses but the ending satisfies.",e
3,14 January 2000,SKG-2,9," As T.C. said, this movie rocks!","You all may know the story at how Tom Cruise saw this movie at a screening in London, and afterwards said, ""This movie rocks.""  Whatever you may think of Mr. Cruise, I happen to agree after watching this film.  Although I had trouble following the story at times, it was a lot of fun, and Ritchie managed to juggle all the characters around and keep me interested and compelled to watch.  I also didn't have any trouble understanding what the characters were saying, and I think those who blind themselves to films like this by saying, ""Oh, I can't understand them"" lack patience.  I also liked all the actors, particularly, of course Lenny McLean and Vinnie Jones(one of my few complaints is I would have liked to see more of them in the film). And for a film which feels violent, there's surprisingly little actual violence, which is refreshing.  Overall, not a particularly deep film, but a lot of fun.",v
4,18 December 1999,CriticNick,10, Seriously addictive movie - The most balanced movie ever made?,"The first time I saw this movie I had difficulty in understanding a lot of the dialogue not just because of the weird accent, but because the actors spoke so damn fast.  But despite this I became literally addicted to it. To begin with my wife got pretty annoyed because any other movie we rented would be ejected after about 20 minutes of viewing and in would go LS&2SB. Now she is hooked as well.",i
5,5 November 1999,jedidp,10," Brilliant script, brilliant cinematography, great acting and soundtrack","Best comedy in years, friend turned me on to this hilarious comedy of errors and glad she did. The film is damn near flawless, forces you to pay attention to the twists and turns through it's witty dialogue. Wonderfully photographed with brilliant camerawork but not overdone. Worth several sittings and we could learn alot in Hollywood from this one....",e
6,5 March 2008,poolandrews,9," Very funny, very witty & very excellent British crime caper.","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is set in London where four close friends Eddie (Nick Moran), Bacon (Jason Statham), Tom (Jason Flemying) & Soap (Dezter Fletcher) all chip in £25,000 to make up the £100,000 entrance fee to a big high stakes poker game held by hard as nails villain & crime boss 'Hatchet' Harry Lonsdale (P.H. Moriarty). Eddie is an expert poker player & figures he can make each of them a clear £100,00 profit, if they play their cards right (ha!). Unfortunately 'Hatchet' Harry doesn't like losing & cheats, Eddie not only loses the £100,000 but actually ends up owing 'Hatchet' Harry £500,000 after borrowing it from him to continue in the game. 'Hatchet' Harry is not the sort of person you owe money to, Eddie & his friends must find a way to raise a half a million pounds in the next four days or start losing their fingers...",w
7,25 April 2021,briancham1994,9, Stylish clockwork,"This film's plot starts off a bit convoluted but gradually meshes together like clockwork, with every scene and line having significance. The varying plotlines weave in and out with expert craft, always leaving the audience wondering what will happen next and never alienating them. These are all funny in a subtle, situational way - muted reactions to extraordinary events, chance encounters and thwarted masculine bravado. The characters are exaggerated, the style is frenetic and the environment is gritty and urban. These all amount to an expertly made crime-comedy with a unique British 90s music video feel.",/
8,29 June 2006,Flagrant-Baronessa,8," Watch this with subtitles, if you can","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels features a lot of local slang and Cockney accents and, while it is far from impossible to comprehend, you will be doing yourself a favour if you follow the dialogue in subtitles. In fact, even the unbearably annoying 'hard-of-hearing' option is welcomed. It follows a group of four very ""working class"" blokes as they try to help their friend Eddie (Nick Moran) get out of an enormous debt he amassed one night, playing high-roller with a local gang-boss that cheated. The lads resort to illegal ways to get the money, like ripping off their pot-selling next-door neighbours.",r
9,13 October 2004,s-dewitt,10, Brilliant,"I have watched this film countless times and it is always funny, entertaining and visually appealing. It combines a great story (actually about 8 stories), lush cinematography (a personal must have), and superb dialog. When I first saw it, I thought it was a good rip-off of pulp fiction (a common theme on the message boards), but later you come to realize that this simply is not the case. IMO, it is much more like ""The Usual Suspects"", another great film.",w
10,26 February 2006,OriginalMovieBuff21,8, A British Reservoir Dogs,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is about four London class act stiffs who put their money to a test in a card game until things end up horribly wrong as they owe half a million pounds within a week to come up with the cash. The movie is by all means, enjoyable. The characters are all likable and their sense of humour makes the movie tick up a notch. I found myself laughing a couple times in the film to the jokes. All the actors played their parts pretty well, but my favorite character of the film had to go to Big Chris as Vinnie Jones. He was the most entertaining and how he was always correcting his son if he ever made any mistakes was priceless. The dialogue was really well done by Guy Ritchie, as well as his directing. What I noticed about the movie, was how much it was alike to the 1992 film, Reservoir Dogs. Lock, Stock had colorful characters, robbery that ends up bad, unexpected tragedies, good screenplay as well as directing by one person, and a good sense of humour. All those resemble to Reservoir Dogs, it's not even funny. Overall, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a good and entertaining comedy/crime film that shows a good future to Guy Ritchie aka ""The Next Quentin Tarantino"", to many. Although it's not up to par with Reservoir Dogs, I still enjoyed it and will be paying a lot of attention to Guy Ritchie's films. I recommend it.",7
11,24 April 2008,RainDogJr,10," Luck, Irony and Two Old Shotguns","After being in love with ""Snatch"", my cousin and I began to look out for this film and finally we saw it on a bootleg of the imported DVD. That was about 3 or 4 years ago and the last year I saw for the very first time the Region 4 DVD so I get my own copy of the film and enjoyed for the second time. Last week I saw ""The Transporter"" and I decide to enjoy once again this magnificent work so I'm here writing, after a third view, my thoughts about Guy Ritchie's first feature film.",3

Let's sort the buyers from the spiers, the needy from the greedy and those who love me from the ones who don't"" Bacon (Jason Statham) and Eddie (Nick Moran) work a street crowd with their hot merchandise. Cops. They flee. When the film suddenly crashes into super-slomo, and a hard, street-savvy narration kicks in (Alan Ford's voice) telling us of Bacon's and Eddie's street chicanery on its last legs, we hark back to the opening of *Pulp Fiction* (where Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are dialoguing intriguingly and cooing like lovebirds over coffee in a diner one minute and in the next, suddenly viciously holding up the joint). Like *Pulp*, this Guy Ritchie-penned and directed trash whore promises to be a dialog-luscious film with a rabid style all its own.",2
13,28 September 2007,kenjha,6, Slick but Unpleasant,"This slick film details the lives of a bunch of blokes in the British underworld as they fight over drug money. The Cockney accents of most of the characters are so thick that anyone outside Britain would have to have the subtitles turned on to understand what is going on. There are too many characters and not a single one of them is likable. It's difficult to keep track of the three gangs, who all seem to have similar looking young men. The plot is interesting though somewhat convoluted. Ritchie directs with a lot of energy but his cinematic tricks (freeze-frames and voice-overs) are distracting. Songs are overused on the soundtrack.",8
14,10 September 2006,lee_eisenberg,10," sooner or later, we're all eighteen with a bullet","Guy Ritchie made his mark on the world with the madcap ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", about organized crime in London's underbelly. I remember that when it came out was right after Columbine, so some people got irked by the violence, but I suggest that you ignore that and luxuriate in the pure hilarity. As great as the plot - maybe better - is the soundtrack. The song ""18 with a Bullet"" may have also reminded people of Columbine. But anyway, this is a movie that you're sure to like. Ritchie followed it up with the equally great ""Snatch."", but unfortunately followed that up with the dreadful ""Swept Away"" remake. But this one is a hoot.",4
15,30 January 2014,planktonrules,9," A lot like ""Snatch"" but with fewer laughs.","Considering that this film was written and directed by Guy Ritchie, it's certainly not very surprising that it is strongly reminiscent of ""Snatch""--another one of Ritchie's film. Obviously, he did well with ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and decided to repeat the formula for his next film. Both have very dark and dry senses of humor, a lot of bad guys (nothing but bad guys), bad language and crude material all wrapped up in an incredibly stylish package. You like one film, you'll like the other. You hate one, you'll hate the other.",7
16,20 January 2001,Keyser Soze-12,9, Easily one of my all time favorites,"I didn't know what to expect when I popped this movie in my VCR.  On one hand, I had heard this movie is hilarious, fun, and three steps from Pulp Fiction.  On the other hand, it's British and it may not transfer into my American head very well.  I had heard also that the movie is a rip-off of Pulp.  Well, let me tell you what I think.",2

19,12 December 1999,Popcorn-28,9," Now do you understand everything I've said? Because if you don't, I'll kill ya","I've avoided this movie for sometime now.  Firstly because friends told me that it was 'Pulp Fiction'-ish (and boy do I hate that movie). Secondly, because its British and although I'm from South East London myself and love British television comedies, I have rarely found British humour well translated onto the big screen.  Normally it is toned down to plain slap-stick goofy uncomplicated Inspector Cleuseau type humour tailored for American audiences.",r

21,21 January 2002,Lumpenprole,6, entertaining,"For $8 million, this is a fricking monument of 1990's film.  The first time I saw it I laughed at most of the jokes and followed the plot with pleasure. That's more than I can say about any number of movies in the 1990's that cost ten times as much to make and starred pricey talent.  The editing is clever and cute.  The casting is just short of flawless.  Of the four principles, only Bacon seemed consistent to me.  The minor parts were sometimes spectacular, esp. Big & Little Chris and Barry the Baptist.",f
22,25 February 2008,emuir-1,9, Vera Day,"I want to know how Vera Day, the sexy blond of British films in the 1950's, who had not made a film since 1964, came to do such a wonderful cameo in this film. The moment she came on the screen, she was the epitome of the attractive, aging, hardboiled sports/pub owner, the kind where they stage boxing matches, and the kind of woman who knows how to keep her mouth shut.",_
23,31 July 2008,pinkliz41,1, Lock Stock and 2 hours of rubbish,"I really cant see why this film is so highly rated. In my eyes it's just a complete mess and Ritchies worst film. Compared to Snatch, this has nothing on it, not even close. The other critics on this website debate that Lock Stock has a better ending and story, but i didn't really see that. The pacing of Lock Stok is astonishingly slow and the characters feel like their cardboard cutouts without a soul. This also brings a negative thrall over this poorly directed and acted mess.",=

25,6 January 2023,gillmurphydogg,10, All the components of a perfect film,"Guy Ritchie and Dexter Fletcher make this a great film. It's the ultimate crime thriller comedy drama. The writing, direction and casting are perfect. The characters are unique and will move between having you in hysteric laughter and on the edge of your seat, not knowing what these unpredictable characters will do next. This is British story-telling at its finest. There are twists and turns in this story that will have you engaged throughout.",t
26,15 December 2010,rps-2,2, Tasteless violence,"Hollywood has no monopoly on crass, vulgar, tasteless, blood spewing depravity.This ghastly piece of British trash is as good (bad?) as anything the schlockmeisters of US cinema have ever done. The film runs 110 minutes. The F word is used 125 times. !!! There is not one character with one redeeming quality. Indeed, if I was a British criminal I would be offended. The story line is complicated enough --- you can't tell the bad guys from the good guys because there are no good guys --- but the thick east end London accents make the dialogue incomprehensible for the most part. There are two or three attempts at comedy. But none of them is funny. Cinema can be so downlifting!",_
27,5 January 2001,zetes,1, Quite possibly the worst film ever made,"This movie is so bad, it is an insult to all those films it ripped off, particularly Reservoir Dogs, which I didn't even like all that much anyway. I know the director claimed that he never saw any of Tarantino's films, and it actually shows in just how terrible Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels was. ",u
28,7 October 2020,Xstal,1, Carry On Vincent...,"What a carry on, the franchise reinvents itself with the poorest incarnation of an actor that ever kicked a football. Coupled with the wooden performances of the rest of the cast, diabolical dialogue and timing - you can almost hear the words 'Action' and 'Cut' as the pantomime continues - this has to go down as one of the worst British films ever made.",r
29,12 March 2021,Filmdokter,6," I like it, but I don't love it like Snatch","This might be a bit of a controversial statement, but I'm not a huge fan of Lock, Stock....
Off course the dialogue is sharp and witty, the camerawork is inventive and the editing is frenetic but both the story and it's characters just don't seem to hit me as it successor does. And what's with that washed out, brownish look? It is more disturbing than stylish. Overall Lock, Stock... is a good first effort of a new director, but I think Guy Ritchie really hit his all time high with Snatch. Just call this a very good dry run.",v

31,6 March 2000,kevin c,1, VERY POOR,"I missed this at the cinema, but heard many good things from my friends about this. I finally caught it on Sky last Saturday, and what an overrated film I saw. The film didn't contain a decent actor to take the lead, and comprised rejects from 'The Bill', sitcoms and Wimbledon F.C. The film didn't contain an original idea, and stole shamelessly from 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Trainspotting', 'Goodfellas', 'Only Fools & Horses' and 'The Italian Job'. The humour and stereotypes were like a bad episode of 'Minder'. It was shot in a grainy stock to compare with some of the British 70s classics. However this most certainly is not a 'Get Carter' or 'The Long Good Friday'. It was more a wet dream for FHM readers. All stylish clothes and no substance, and where was a female character?",
32,15 March 2021,kosmasp,8, And so it began,"It had been quite some time since I first saw this. The beginning of Guy Ritchie and the beginning of Jason Statham. If you watch this after all the movies he has done since, you may be a bit surprised by his role here. But back then, he was not a big shot, quite the opposite was the case. And this movie was quite rough on the edges. While I remembered the humor and comedy, I had forgotten about the grimness at places. About how down and dirty it is sometimes.",
33,30 October 2001,nqure,1, Clever contrived plot but ultimately shallow,"I didn't catch this at the cinema as I was somewhat put off by the hype and media circus surrounding it.

Guy Ritchie certainly knows how to devise contrived and clever plots; the ending was a nice homage to 'The Italian Job'.",

41,30 April 2000,Quinoa1984,8, Funny flick. Clever.,"Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a funny film that gives new word to ""disorderly"".  About a group of low-lifes (Jason Flemying, Nick Moran, Dexter Flitcher) who have to pay a load of money to a mob boss who also runs a porn shop.  In this escapade, many funny (and crude) things happen, including a retreival of only 2 guns (and lots of money) and a father criminal and his tag-along son.

50,27 June 2001,=G=,6," Lock, Stock, and a barrel of boring nonsense.","""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" is an over-rated, somewhat original dark crime comedy out of the UK which wears itself out early in its 1.6 hour run. Telling of a bunch of small time hoodlums, some smaller than others, ""Lock, Stock..."" is a convoluted tale which uses the same in-your-face monotonic deadpan exaggerated comedic effect in every scene. The characters are all vulgar misfits comic book males who become drones of monotony in short order.

51,7 May 2003,Theo Robertson,9, A Victim Of Its Own Success,"I watched this soon after it was released on video and was blown away ( Geddit ? ) by it . Unfortunately after seeing it a few more times since then I notice it`s become a victim of its own success . By that I mean every single British film released between 1999 and 2002 seemed to be about gangsters in one form or another carrying out a scam against a funky soundtrack in an inferior retread of LSATSB . In fact Guy Ritchie isn`t below plagerising himself with SNATCH which was basically the same film stylewise . But this was the original and best of the Brit gangster new wave. Brilliantly written in a sharp bleakly comical style with some mind bending cinematography by Tim Maurice Jones . There is some criticism that the acting is a bit wooden but I guess that`s deliberate on the part of Ritchie so that the dialogue comes to the fore . And what great lines the characters have , especially Rory`s "" Do you understand Nicholas ? Good cos if you don`t I`ll kill ya "" speech .",

53,6 September 2007,pswanson00,8," Hilarious, for the right audience.","I like this film a lot, but it is REEally not for everybody. Firstly, it will help non-English viewers if they watch a lot of BBC America, because the accents are a bit thick. There's even a scene in which a lot of Cockney rhyming slang is flying around which sometimes is broadcast with subtitles...and it needs them! Secondly, there's a fair amount of violence in ""Lock, Stock,""... and even though some is humorous, it's decidedly black humor. The scene toward the end where you might say ""everybody gets his"" could be used in a horror film, if it weren't for the ridiculous circumstances which brought the participants together. Guy Ritchie did a masterful job of relieving tension almost as it was being created, without spoiling either the tension or the laughs. The casting of this film is a fine example of getting a good portrayal of a tough guy by hiring a genuinely tough man to play him. Vinnie Jones, P.H. Moriarty, and the late, great Lenny McLean all had real hard-man credibility established before they started acting, and it brought a reality to their work which is hard to get. Sting's work in a small role is perfect, by the way; he should act more. To sum up: pour a Guinness and enjoy L,S, & 2 S.B. -- it is great.",

55,2 January 2001,Rammstein-2,9, Absolutely brilliant,"Comparing Guy Ritchie to Quentin Tarantino may have its perks, but I'd prefer not to. The only similarity between them is that they depict the lives and times of low-life criminals in a humorous way, and that they both have a real skill in writing plots with many twists and turns. However alike their writing is, there is nothing similar in their directing. While Tarantino is sometimes painfully slow and contemplative, Ritchie is fast, violent, witty and music video influenced.

57,5 June 2008,mr_popcorn,10," McCheesy's take on ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels""","Guy Ritchie is a genius. He turned a seemingly generic card-themed flick into something magnificent I don't even know where to start.

Part of the reason is that the formative years of Hollywood in the twenties and early thirties coincided with the growth of organised crime fuelled by Prohibition, a period when the doings of Al Capone and his contemporaries provided a rich source of inspiration for film-makers. Another part of the reason is that during this period the British Board of Film Censors tended to discourage home- made gangster movies. This form of censorship owed little to moral concerns about violence- the BBFC were quite happy to allow cinemas to show American crime flicks- and a good deal to political considerations. British governments, of all political complexions, liked to play down any suggestion that the country had a serious organised crime problem. (And, by American standards, it didn't).",

""Pulp Fiction"" at least has some fresh lines, and the actor's are more believable as criminals. Guy Ritchie's effort seems as if he wants to become the European heir to Tarantino. He plays all too hard to try for the pop-culture youth demographic. This takes away from the film. All throughout it emits the feeling of a director looking for his Muse; but he can't find one so he ends up trying to imitate Scorsese and Tarantino - but convert them ""hip"" to young Anglo culture. The editing is wretched. When I first saw this film over in the British Isles I could tell it was directed by some young hot-shot who used to make music videos and was trying to hand at feature-length film - but using the same video techniques he employed in his previous works. It's choppy and stupid. If you want to see a film made with real insights of the crime underworld, which also contains genuine moments of laughter see ""GoodFellas"" or ""Mean Streets"".

In lock stock you get four working class friends who need to acquire 500 grand in a week to avoid having their fingers chopped off and worse. Their next door neighbours rob drug dealers. What ensues is a barrage of double crossing cockney slang madness and most of the time takes the black comedy route. The original soundtrack is execellent composed by john murphy and the acting is funny and incredibly good.

I really enjoyed (note the sarcasm) the slow motion and ""trippy"" camera work that were used at certain points. They were not the least bit necessary, as they did not reveal anything about the character or the scene.

I read the rave reviews, and didn't bother with the bottom end. They were the ones that got it right. Even three stars is probably at least one too many. First off: it seemed to take forever to get going. I kept thinking, when is the story going to start? Second: I couldn't separate the various gangs --- they all looked more or less the same, and spoke in the same incomprehensible patter, dull, witless and obscene. Three: the whole thing felt like a continuous rip-off of earlier films. Not homage, simple-minded rip-off. The ending was so strongly reminiscent of The Italian Job, I could hardly credit it. After reading the one-star reviews I now recognise the lifts from countless other gangster movies, all better than this one. One constant cliché in English crime movies is the lovable criminal Cockney, nearly always incompetent. Personally, I find Cockneys, real as well as cinematic, uniformly unlovable. The Long Good Friday I thought was a very bad film, and this reminded me of it. LSTSM also reminded me, sadly, of True Romance, which is a great, great film.",

Moriarty as 'Hatchet' Harry Lonsdale, he has a week to get it all back, and Harry has loyal debt collector Big Chris (Vinnie Jones), with son Little Chris (Peter McNicholl), to make sure it is paid. With the help of his mates Tom (Jason Flemyng), Soap (A Bear's Tail's Dexter Fletcher) and Bacon (Jason Statham), they plan a robbery not hatched by them, but by their neighbours. The first thing that happens is that two antique long barrel shotguns are bought for a £700 scam, and the four jack-the-lads have quite a few other things going wrong, and it is really amusing when the gang realise the two guns are worth thousands, at the wrong moment.

124,13 August 1999,jriggins,5, Didn't live up to critics' rave reviews...,"Despite a decent plot and dialogue, this film did almost nothing for me with the exception of irritating me tremendously.  Of the cast, at least three were blatant Steve Buscemi mimics while another might as well have been a contestant in a Dennis Leary wannabe contest.  The characters seem to be overtly modeled, directly mind you, after characters from Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.  Overall the movie seemed like a weak attempt at matching Tarentino's genius character development from those films. Not to mention the less obvious Kubrick rip off with their version of Nadsat (the dialect used in Clockwork Orange).  During one scene a bartender is telling a story using a dialect consisting of words meaning things other than their conventional definitions.  While this definitely has potential, as Kubrick demonstrated, the director chose to use subtitles for the bartender's dialect so the audience would be better able to understand him. It could have been better if a similar dialect was used throughout the movie and the audience was forced to learn the language in order to understand the dialogue. Aside from these irritating facets of the movie, it was generally good. The plot shifts were creative as was the overall cinematography.  I might have given it a 6 or 7 based on the plot, but because of the rip off characters and dialogue, I have to give it a 4.  It's worth seeing if you don't think you'll have similar grievances as I did, but if you watch a lot of movies, this will probably serve to annoy you as much as it did me.",

I therefore look forward to a future revised version of L S & 2 SBs in which the even naffer and more unnecessary voiceovers are removed. As the film opens with the spiel of a street seller, some highly contrived visuals and a setup requiring the aforementioned naff voiceovers I thought I was in for an episode of Eastenders but with lots of swearing.

I think that's where a lot of the picture's humor comes from actually, because British slang and it's colloquialisms are so off-beat and unfamiliar to the American ear.

It doesn't go as planned, and as his name might suggest to you, the H is not someone you want to owe money(he could send Barry the Baptist(McLean) at you... why call him that? 'cause he likes to drown people), and they have a week to come up with it. Meanwhile, their neighbours are planning to rob a group of pot-growers of their product and the wealth of profit it has brought in so far, and there are two antique rifles(hence the title) in play as well, and the various factions(did I mention there's a Samoan mob in this, too? The leader looks adorable, until he opens his mouth and threatens death and destruction, and you find yourself trusting him on that) are all after one or more of these items, either for what they're worth or because they have to, for someone else. There are a ton of mix-ups(the audience are the only ones to know everything that happens), and in addition to these surprising twists and turns, this is kept going a lot through the golden, quotable dialog(note that most of it is full of slang from the local area, and if you're not familiar with such, you may need subtitles to follow this) and these situations where people are threatened by this or that circumstance or person. This is a gangster-comedy-thriller, with a macho, very *guy* sense of humor to it. A lot of the fun comes from the quirk, as well. Ritchie loves him some dumb hustlers(here and in Snatch), and he plays with the camera and editing with the grace of a virtuoso, leading to a visually stylized film that never bores you. The characters are distinct, and for the sheer amount, that is as impressive a feat as how much screen time and development are actually afforded the lot of them. Everyone is well-cast and the acting is great. The types here are priceless. Vinnie Jones portrays an enforcer, as he should. This keeps to a marvelous pace. The 100 minutes fly by. There is a lot of brutal, bloody violence, strong language, crude references and a little nudity/sexuality in this. The DVD comes with a trailer for this.

Without him there would be no Sexy Beast and no Layer Cake, there would most likely be no Vinnie Jones or Jason Statham either. The intertwining of multiple plot lines has been been before, and most likely he has used Pulp Fiction here as a model. Only his plot is much more involved, his dialogue more believable and his characters more real than any one figure in Tarantino's vehicle. The result is a smart, sassy and savvy film, that takes us into a seedy underworld, where the characters convey more menace with a single look, word or gesture than Pulp Fiction can sustain throughout. As a result l found myself far more engaged and wondering how the story was going to be resolved than in any other crime film l can recall in of the last couple of decades. ",

147,4 June 2012,KineticSeoul,7, Guy Ritchie Begins,"This movie is what launched Guy Ritchie's career and for good reason even if it's his debut movie as well. I can tell Ritchie is a fan of Quentin Tarantino or at least inspired by his work cause this movie has certain elements that seem like it was inspired by Tarantino. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing in some cases including this one. What drives this movie is the over the top and snazzy dialogue despite the constant profanity. The plot is simple but goes in a slightly convoluted direction. In fact for some viewers it maybe difficult to understand what is exactly going on when viewing for the first time. Mainly because it has multiple different group of people, each group having their own story but later comes together in one melting pot. The plot includes hustlers, thieves, loan sharks and gangsters but they are all after one thing and that is money. In fact most of the movie revolves around the characters bickering, arguing and fighting each other for money while using some flashy and witty British dialogue. The dialogue sometimes even has some pretty good humor in it, the black comedy aspect of this movie really works and doesn't seem forced at all. Lot of the good humor comes from the awkwardness of certain situations though. The plot isn't all that coherent and seem over the place at times, but the good dialogue is able to back that up. This movie shows that being a fanboy and getting inspiration from other people's work can create something very watchable as long as they don't plagiarize. Since there is a difference between inspiration and just plain copying in a very secretive manner. If you wanna watch a movie about bunch of guys quarreling over money in a entertaining manner in a sort of Tarantino style fashion, this movie might be for you. This is one of those movies where the build up is most definitely worth it when it comes to the finale. This isn't a artistic movie or has any morals but if you want a movie with a good blend of violence and profanity this one just might be for you.",

The story's not bad, although to my eyes at any rate, there's simply too many characters. It gets to where it's impossible to keep track of them all. In contrast, ""Pulp Fiction"" had just the right amount of characters and plot complexity to engage your brain without making you feel like you had to keep rewinding the movie to figure out who was who and where each character fit into the plot.

Then hell comes raining down on them, when they acquire these old antique shotguns. Action, some of it comic style, and some nasty impassse's ensue, among situation after situation, making for a tight scripted film, with kick arse dialogue. The performances of the four are great, where later though, Stratham, really proved that he was only of standard acting ilk. Vinnie Jones was great and funny, as one of the heavies trying to track down those collectables, and be careful when you use bad language around his son. I found Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, to be immensely enjoyable, and a true blue original, that kind of set the set the standard for a new wave of British gangster flicks.

The movie is indeed one that shaped a general image of a Guy Ritchie movie, a greatly funny and ironic crime movie, a heist movie in sub genre. Though the movie being ironic an funny is more or less predictable for me, I was still curious about how the story will unfold. Also the quirky and shady characters developed are the things that add much curiosity to the movie.

In this movie he works the new movie genre: a stylish humorous gangster movie. There are Tarantino similarities but this movie stands up on its own. A classic worth the watch. (By the way, an earlier reviewer said that there is only 1 woman in the film - there are in fact 2 - the card game supervisor is the other one and she talks. It's still a ""blokey"" film however).",

The team is made up of jason flemyng, dexter fletcher, nick moran and the legend himself jason statham. A great group that provide some good comic relife and serious tones.

The scene in the first half where a burning man comes out of the Samoan Bar and Tom, Soap & Bacon just look at him and go in as if nothing new has happened is damn hilarious!!! However, its only in the second half, when you come to realize how that man was burnt (..by Rory..), and that is the inter-threading I'm talking about....THAT IS BRILLIANT!!! This is also one of those rare movies where you tend to fall in love with almost every character, no matter how big or small his role is.

With touches of such predecessors as Trainspotting and Reservoir Dogs, Guy Ritchie was able to make a movie that was at the same time thrilling and funny, with exciting visual and narrative style. The plot is confusing and simple at the same time, only because of the abundance of colorfully language characters, who are all stupid. If it's one thing about Guy Ritchie's films it's that his characters are obviously very dumb, but the ones with even the slightest hint of good sense and good morals will come out a little bit less bruised than the rest.

It also has a fairly complex plot with many characters which is both good and bad. Good in that there is some depth to the storytelling, but bad in that it becomes a chore to follow it all. Also the cinematography left something to be desired, it was not really to my liking. But I can appreciate why this is viewed as a seminal work by many, however I feel that it is somewhat overrated.

When you consider that the Pale was the region around Dublin where an Englishman could travel in safety, the notion takes on even more meaning.  Why does this film, a portrait of Marginal people who are all screwed up some way, work?  Well, there is a certain innocence to the characters which when coupled with their more malicious side creates chaos.  But, hey, isn't this the usual state of affairs in the human condition?  Aren't we all screwed up just a bit in some bizarre way?  This is a constant theme in the films of Joel and Ethan Coen and here, we find their counterpart in the backstreets of London.  But, it takes more than simply recognizing that we're all a bit goofy somewhere underneath to make a funny film and the likes of Vinny Smith, Jason Statham and the rest of the gang, combine to leave us howling for more. I know I was.  Why would an old geezer like me read all 270+ reviews here before writing these words that will likely never be seen? Well, it has to do with wanting to see if others saw what I did.

201,21 May 2016,Horror-yo,7, Tons of fun,"I'm no Guy Ritchie supporter or anything and therefor in reviewing this film I remain more objective than some might be. This here is a heavily English action-comedy, I emphasize its country of origin as some might be too foreign to its cultural tinge and should be mindful of that during its viewing. Slang, talking speed, the attitudes overall...it's definitely different, and this film wasn't made to be a polished flavorless ready-to-sell-internationally item. It's authentic, rough in places but never too much and showcases an effortless (and surprising ?) balance of humor and comedy, along with hard-hitting, raw action. Its main plot is uber simple, but that's totally fine. In fact, it makes it better. Because now the movie has its trigger and the movie-makers can focus on all the rest: the little subplots, the humor, involving other characters and parties to the core of the story, before unleashing an ultimate climax at the end that is, again, very simple, almost too simple; and yet, at the risk of sounding over-complacent, it works - fits that story and mood perfectly. No reason film shouldn't be this way from time to time. Yeah it's simple, but it's effective, lots of fun, runs so smoothly and where it isn't deep and what not, it's highly entertaining, and you can't just make 'highly entertaining' if you don't know movie making.",

Lock Stock tells the story of how a group of east end lads overcome the local mobs through a series of astonishing and humorous coincidences. Never before has a mix of witty black comedy, humorous          and intelligent scripting gone so well together in a British Gangster movie. Guy Richie puts all the best elements of a good crime thriller together to create the perfect blend of fast paced witty action comedy.  Clever stylish editing speeds the narrative along at a perfect pace, the east end backdrop provides a gritty aesthetic authenticity and a snappy script with witty one liners provides the perfect comedy appeal together with the at times cartoonish         .  Guy Richie indelibly makes his mark in the British film industry and in the US as a young and very talented director and writer.

221,5 May 2020,zeekwunlau,8, Turn absurdity into reality,"This movie is undoubtedly brilliant, no matter the plot concept, shooting skills, voiceover settings are inherited works. But after watching this movie, my biggest feeling is that the director not only told a wonderful little character counterattack, but also involved the absurdity of human existence as a social animal.
Human society is built on the group of people, but each individual person has an independent consciousness. This makes it almost impossible for individuals in a complicated social group to master the complete situation, and everyone is analyzing and even taking actions through their own logical judgment, which undoubtedly complicates the relationship again. Absolute authority can be established to combat repression, and on the other hand, mutual benefit can be achieved through cooperation. And once the relationship breaks, the real existence that those people think will be wiped out in vain.
The reason for the existence of dramatic scenes in this movie is that the interests of money establish the connection between these people. The ""big men"" control and squeeze the small people through violent suppression, and the collection of actions of the small people at the same time eventually leads to the reversal of the entire event. The turning point is the decay of human life. Therefore, the key basic point is that the means by which human beings establish relationships, if the relationship is established by ""death to death"", then there will be a ""people not afraid of death"" and take risks, if the relationship is established on the basis of relative relaxation and mutual benefit There may be completely different results, but this is inevitable. So maybe human nature cannot be taken seriously.",

A bunch of bombastic, mini-stories are unfathomably linked by weed, money and two rare, expensive shotguns. Not the kind of story you hear on a daily basis. Every thug, youth, gangster and pot-head gets equal screen-time. Four Londoners bite off more than they can chew; Eddy (Moran) owes some serious dollar to gangster/porn shop owner Hatchet Harry (Moriarty) after losing in a poker-style card game. Tom (Flemyng), Soap (Fletcher), Bacon (Statham) and Eddy have 500k to find in a week, or they're dead-meat. Their plan? Snatch money from drug dealers who plan to snatch money from drug dealers. Who's involved? An ex-footballer who pulls off thug-life considerably well (Vinnie Jones), a real life bare-knuckle fighter (Lenny McLean), a Russian with anger issues and a couple of naive Scousers that spearhead every scene they're in. The conclusion is catastrophic but highly engrossing; Lock, Stock's black comedy hits all the funny bones in the right places, even with its mildly haphazard narrative.

However last night for some reason or another I sat down and watched it and yes it really was that dame good . The dialogue was classy , the jokes hit the spot and I did find it to be some what addictive viewing . This film goes up there with Pulp Fiction , it does require a close following to but once you get sucked in , trust me you will love every second of it ! The plot is wacky , the ride that follows after that is a barrel of laughs . The main character's are not trying to go OTT on acting like hard men but it flows naturally even their dim-witted behaviour . I would say that my favourite characters would have to be Soap for his witty comments especially when it come to knives , Vinnie Jones who seems to play a very questionable roll model to his son as his line of work is not totally kosher but my absolute favourite has to be the football loving yardie Rory Breaker played with brilliance by Vas Blackwood (His I'll kill ya speech just can't stop making me laugh ) . This one Britian's finest exports , highly entertaining stuff , not to be missed with plenty of reply value , but thats what you would expect from the man who gave you Snatch .

235,5 May 2020,krational66,8, It's cool to play.,"At first sight, it feels similar to ""Guess the Train"", but it looks better than ""Guess the Train"". This is the debut film of British director Garage, also translated as ""Two Big Smokers"", which is 107 minutes long. The brand-new British new movie, formerly known as ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", was found on the Internet and found to be an English saying, which translates to ""eliminate and fight""
The director's shooting style is avant-garde and unique. When you feel good after reading it and feel that there are still some areas that you don't understand, the cool elements always stay in your mind for a long time.
Several highlights of this film:
1. The language is cool.
All actors have a strong London accent, mixed with boring, interesting English proverbs.
2. Visually cool.
The use of lens and character modeling design are quite fashionable and modern. The use of slow-motion, close-up, and reverse shots produces visual effects with unlimited imagination. The editing is clean and easy, and the rhythm is bright and comfortable.
3. Music is cool.
Films are playing very exciting music from the beginning to the end. British rock, heavy metal, punk, and jazz are all included. It is really enjoyable with eyes and ears.
4. Cool structure.
The plot of is complex but not chaotic, and the development of the plot is quirky and not absurd. Several gangs intertwined dramatically, forming an exciting plot.
5. The ending is cool.
The director left a suspenseful and suspenseful ending. I ca n't wait to say it immediately, but I do n't want to say it. Let everyone see for themselves, laugh ...",
236,7 April 1999,Brogan,10," PULP FICTION & 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY, English Style.","I heard very little before seeing this movie.  I was just told by my friends that it's the best film to come from England since ""THE FULL MONTY"" and that it's great!  So, I put on my Dr. Martin's boots, put in my collection of English Pop Music from the 80's and early 90's (New Order, OMD, The Farm, Madness, etc.) and got into my English mood.  After seeing this movie, I was pleased, very very pleased!  I think this movie is better and more exciting than the current #1 film at the box office, ""THE MATRIX."" ""LOCK STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS"" has different stories.  They range from losing a huge bet during a poker game, two clumsy thieves stealing two antique shot-guns, a gang of young men figuring out on how to get 500,000 Pounds to a mob boss by Sunday, another gang planing on stealing money from weed dealers, and so on. This has been done many times, PULP FICTION is the most famous version, 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY was the most underrated, and GO is the most recent.  But what makes this film work?  Simple, the characters, the stories, the rich dark humor, and the directing.  You actually care about these characters, you wonder on what's going to happen to them next.  I was amazed to see YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES Nichols Rowe on screen after not seeing him for almost 15 years.  But if anyone stands out with their character or acting, it would be Vinnie Jones playing ""Big Chris"" the hit-man for the Mob Boss Harry ""Hatchet"" Lonsdale. He brings his son who's about ten years old along during his work, ""Big Chris"" even allows his son to watch him beat up on a person, but he won't allow him to swear or to blasphemy. Along with other great U.K. films ""TRAINSPOTTING"" ""THE COMMITMENTS"" ""THE FULL MONTY"" ""WAKING NED DIVINE"" ""MONA LISA"" ""THE KRAYS"" ""THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY"" and all of the Monty Python films.  ""LOCK STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS"" proves that you can always rely on the English for great entertainment. Don't miss it!!  ***** out of ***** (Five stars out of five)",

Clearly defines that comedy takes place with situations and not by dialogs alone.,"I would have given the film 9/10 but our beloved bollywood had copied the concept about 60% at least the last part and all about the guns. So at a later point of time i was just cursing bollywood. The story what they showed in the Hindi version with the name ""Fir Hera pheri"" was also good and this movie also serves to be a good relief. Guy Ritchie sure do know how to write scripts.

This movie attempted to be like Pulp Fiction in the sense that there are a lot of characters and a lot of stuff going on for the viewer to watch. The difference is Guy Ritchie does a horrible job doing it. You get characters confused, don't know what's going on, no characters developed, and are constantly wondering what is going on. Meanwhile in Pulp Fiction, you know what's going on, you just don't know where it's going. I can't believe this got such high ratings and that people said it was actually funny. Maybe you could point out the funny parts to me, because I didn't see any. Fans of Pulp Fiction will hate this. 5/10",

However, their host Hatchet Harry has rigged the game to rook the lads for all they're worth and by the end of the evening, they're half a million in debt. In order to repay Harry, the four hatch a new plan to intercept a shipment of drugs. What follows next is a hilarious series of accidental double- crosses, botched heists and other bungled crimes.

The sometimes impenetrable Cockney accents, multitude of not always terribly distinctive characters to keep track of, lame sight gags and skimping on vital scene-linking information (not to mention an absurd, almost non-existent police presence) tend to cancel out its strengths. Setting it in London gives it novelty points, but had it been made in America with American actors it would not have been nearly as celebrated.

The comedy is bound to the plot and action of the movie and it never feels forced: and that's what great comedies do, they never hurry the laugh out of you.

So what if the style and story remind you of a couple of other movies, or if, in a couple of cases, you can see what's coming in the next scene?

Lo and behold it became one of my top 5 movies (with the company of Boondock Saints, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and The Shawshank Redemption). It took awhile for me to piece it all together, but the plot is very clever and probably one of my favorites ever. The acting is great, the one liners are great, the soundtrack is EXCELLENT (the Dusty Springfield and James Brown fit in so well to the style of the film), the characters were memorable (not quite as cartoonish as in SNATCH, which is good).

Acting is refreshing, music perfect for the film and editing, photography, jokes and all the rest work perfectly well together.

Basically, it's a comedy that's chock-full of violence, but fortunately not graphic violence.  The lead characters are very likable and there's a real feeling of camaraderie between them.  I loved the stoners and ""Big Chris"" and ""Little Chris"" and all the incidental details that gave the story a lived-in texture.

To get the money back they try to rip off a marijuana robbery, but total chaos breaks loose.  The body count rises until all of their enemies have successfully killed eachother off.

It's like watching a long music video except it's not boring at all. It's the teenager's pulp fiction. I felt like getting up that very instant to write or film with my new inspiration. There's afros, cool clothes, a sex shop, a forest of weed (the shot where the guy was trying to navigate through it was dynomite). It's got one of the best opening scenes I can think of and a really good soundtrack. See!",

Against seemingly impossible odds, dogged by the ignorant film companies, Ritchie succeed in making a masterpiece. There are simply too many good points to comment on about this film, but the rhythm of it is ingenius in it's own way. The film may have been partialy inspired by that of the late Pulp Fiction, but uses a far more complex storytelling moethod, with more characters, more slapstick, and sarcasim. The main theme in genereal of the film is ""sarcasim"" i.e. it's not funny to laugh at someone being shot, but now after seeing this it is. The film is ideal for all British, and European audiences, but for viewrs in America may be unsuitable, as it's difficult for someone who speaks with a strong American accent to follow regional English accents such as Scouse, Cornish, and Cockeny, which are frequently or partially recurrent throughout the film. The thing I thought most highly of this film was the way in which the sharp editing techniques and special FX blended in nicely with the background music & songs, portraying an almost real depiction of what it's like to be either devastated or horizontally-drunk beyond visualisation. Also teh way in which it's filmed. A highly-expensive rocket-fuel-iggnition lensed camera was used to achieve the glossy golden look that is underground London--go on my son'' Watch this then be spun, then watch it over to see stuff you missed. The director's cut's got extra footage, and 3 outakes from the film. IT WOULD BE A CRIME TO MISS IT--10/10",

The story felt a bit like last man standing, and definitely a mythical look at life in the East End (""EastEnders"" being another). But hugely enjoyable to watch and I really didn't care which side would come out left standing and alive. I've always had a bit of a crush on Dexter Fletcher when he was in Derek Jarman's Caravaggio as a 20-something but he hasn't aged well 20 years on. Mind you, neither has Sean Bean, who was also in Caravaggio. But I digress. Sting definitely is a great actor and his eye close ups looked scary and creepy. But the real hero of the story is Vinnie Jones, who as a doting father just made me laugh out loud when chiding his son for using bad language while perpetrating the most sickening violence himself.

It's a hilariously original comedy with hordes of interesting characters to examine, interpret, and guess the outcomes of.  It is modern and has it's fare share of violence, yes, but that doesn't mean it's carbon-copy Tarantino.  Tarantino is all style.  He's there to be cool and slick, let the audience on a ride.  Guy Ritchie is about making people laugh while keeping them interested.  There's action to keep your eyes open and your mind out of the gutter, but it backplays that with a witty comment at the end.  I know some people don't find a dozen people getting shot funny, no matter how awkward or Euripidean the situation is.  I understand that, and so do the filmmakers.  This is not a movie for all people.  It's a movie for people who like things fast paced.  Whether it be dialogue, action, comedy, or visual style, it all comes at you like a bullet in this non-stop film.

309,2 September 1999,Mookie-21,9, ONe of the great films of the year..,"I rented Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels the day it arrived. Having been a small release, I hadn't gotten to a theater to check it out. I did rent it with a little bit of reluctance, having rented the hideously overrated Go the evening before. Go was considered to be the greatest of the Tarantino knock offs. However, after watching the film, my reluctance had no place because this is not a Tarantino knock off. Ritchie himself said he has never seen Tarantino's brillant Reservoir Dogs. That's not the purpose here, though. The purpose here is to tell how well crafted this film is. To give you an idea, I have never seen a film that had such a clear sense of style and storytelling. Ritchie has defined his sort of hyperkinetic flashy style, and gives us more of a shot with his control of the camera{which is more like a seasoned pro then a beginner, but Ritchie has worked in commercials} then Tarantino has done in all of his films{Don't get me long, I worship Tarantino}. That being said, just because it has this flashy fast paced way about it does not make it hard to understand. Yes, there are over 22 important character in this film, but I hadn't for a second got any of them confused. I know  who belonged where, and what there purpose was. Plus, all the performances were excellent. Not many directors can tell story with as much style and as coherently as this. Ritchie pulls it off to near perfection. He is a brillant director.",
310,11 August 1999,Mookie-21,9, Amazing,"Orson Welles did it with Citizen Kane in 1939. Martin Scorcese did it in 1973 with mean Streets{and went on to floor us numerous more times}. George Lucas did it with American Graffitti{and need I say more}. Quentin Tarantino did it with Reservoir Dogs in 1991{and made two more films just as good}. And Doug Liman did it with Swingers in 1996. I am talking about what these brillant men did with their first films, and many of them went on to even more acclaim. This men redefined aspects of Cinema with their first films. We can add Guy Ritchie to this list. He has delivered the best heist film since Reservoir Dogs{which is only slightly better then this film}. It's hard to see a director who has done everything so near perfection. His cast rules, their performances{all perfect} amazing, the script tremendously clever, the music perfect, the camera mind boggling. If you watch this film without knowing its Ritchie's first work, you will have the impression he is a seasoned veteran. THis film is beautifully filmed. And it isn't just Tarantino run-off. Ritchie's script works perfectly, and it isn't just Tarantino's work. If Quentin Tarantino is considered the symbol of American cinema, then Ritchie is England's. This film just goes to show what we are missing. Not many films work as well as this one in terms of style and story. If Ritchie doesn't go the way of Tarantino{who needs to resurface, I think all the crap that has been released lately is considered Tarantino run off is not just an attempt to cash in, but a cry for help. Quentin, answer it} and continues on this path, he has quite a future ahead. I can't wait for his next film, called Diamonds. **** out of ****",

312,24 December 2010,jusco15,6," jusco's review: Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels","It's like Snatch's twin brother, which I guess is understandable considering it's the same director. Guy Ritchie's first film is in typical fashion; bizarre, erratic, whimsical. Once again following several interlinking story arcs, it is a puzzling crime film with a lot of laughs and deaths. Four young men find themselves in debt to a crime lord (£500,000!) and they conspire to steal money from their weed-growing next door neighbours. On top of that, two antique guns and a whole bunch of characters find themselves unknowingly involved and pitted against each other; a perfect setup for a comedic and violent tragedy. Containing smart dialogue and sharp, stylish camera work (different from Snatch's editing, but still unconventional) and relatively solid performances all round, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a solid debut from the British director. Unfortunately, if you end up watching both Snatch and this, you'll be sick of the similar styles and tones. However, it is still hilarious and of course, shocking, and it's well worth a watch. Though Snatch may have had more laugh-out-loud moments, I personally enjoyed the crafting of this film better; the editing was not as distracting, thus allowing smoother flow, and I also found the ending brilliant. But please, I beg you Mr. Ritchie, don't do it again. We've had enough of heavily-accented British crime comedy films, especially from you.",

Many people point to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction as the most revolutionary films of the modern era but some might argue that Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels deserves just as much credit as these two. Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie brought everyone into the modern day of what movies could be and what many now are. Guy Ritchie, unfortunately for him, didn't write as many quotable one liners as Tarantino, not to mention the heavy cockney accents found in this film as well as Snatch. In the eyes of the general public, these reasons are why Ritchie is back a couple of notches from the fame of Tarantino. ",

Lock, Stock... is a bit more stylish than Snatch, and the end sequence was filmed on Battersea bridge! ( the exclamation mark is there for people like me who have walked across the bridge many times without even realising) The film is quite offensive in parts, but is still a masterpiece of a film. The plot is a group of 5 friends save up enough money to play cards with ""Mr Big"" Harry Lonsdale, however, the game is rigged and after borrowing money off of Harry he has 1 week to pay him back or he gets his fingers cut off! That night, as the friends squabble amongst themselves, Eddie hears his neighbours planning a robbery of weed and shoeboxes full of money, so they decide, in order to get the money, they simply rob the robbers. Things go fine - or at least thats what they think. The weed they took belonged to a deadly gang lead by a crazy junkie who's lunacy is told in brilliant cockney-rhyming slang flashback that is subtitled. This leads to a right kerfuffle as everyone is killing each other - literally! a great film 10 out of 10.",

They both show a strange underworld which probably doesn't exist, but this film is much more amusing (Pulp Fiction doesn't have a guy being beaten to death with a dildo). Some may find the end annoying (I wont spoil it for you) and you Yanks will have trouble understanding it (Trainspotting was a different accent, this is in a different language) but if you do watch it I guarantee you will be laughing out loud.

Guy Ritchie must be a very talented fellow and it appears he does his own writing and directing. What I like the most about him though is that when Madonna came back to the US and wanted him to return with her, he put his foot down and stayed in England where he is making a name for himself.  He can do his kind of films over there and I just hope that we can see more of them over here.  Looks like if Madonna wants to keep him, she's going to have to change her demanding, spoiled ways.

Throw in some all-time likable tough guys like Vinnie Jones Lenny McClean and you have the mix of a good crime drama. The thing is, this wasn't a crime drama. Lock Stock was much more than this, it made me laugh, sweat, act squeamish, and still made me attached to some of it's characters. In my opinion this movie was better then Snatch although Snatch had the big American actor to back it, Brad Pitt. This simple but ingeniously scrapped together story about a mean porn king and a group of underachievers in London taps all the emotions of the viewer. It's a shame Lenny Mclean passed after acting in this film because he was easily one of the true tough SOB's both on and off the set and would have been a great actor for some time. If you like comedies, dramas, action, or movies in general, this is a must see!!! - Don't be a Tit",

336,28 October 2009,megadoomer,10, An All-Time Great in the Heist/Crime Comedy Genre,"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is a stylish, witty, and fast-paced comedy that spans every level of the London criminal underworld. The film is centered on four friends who pool their money so that one of them can enter a high-stakes back-room poker game. Eddie (Nick Moran), a natural at reading the most minute involuntary reactions, is convinced he can't lose. The game has been rigged against him, however, and what looked like a sure thing ends with Eddie and his friends in debt to a local crime boss and purveyor of pornography named Hatchet Harry. Now these three petty criminals (and one aspiring chef named Soap who's always managed to keep his hands clean) have one week to come up with £500,000 or Harry's enforcer will start taking their fingers.

It contains guns, gangs and blood but it also contains a marvelous direction and many funny quotes. First of all this movie can be seen for comedy or an action film. The actors don't play their roles ridiculously and they don't make you say that they were laughing through making of, it is a complete balance of a comedy and an action movie that you just want to see. Excellent soundtrack including rock, jazz and even folk (i am from Greece and i love ""Zorbas"" during a battle). Guy Ritchie makes a fantastic work directing so the cast does. It's not just a movie for laughs, it's a masterpiece of action/comedy and showing us that Guy Ritchie is not just the husband of Maddona.

The web gets even more tangled when they unknowingly try to sell mass amounts of Cannabis back to the very person it is stolen from and in the process get their hands on a couple of antique shot guns that Hatchet Harry wants.

The appropriate use of slow-motion and music in this film give it a quality that could only be described as a ""Guy Ritchie film.""  The main feature of this film that I noticed at first however, is the noticeable lack of presence of women.  The domination of masculinity presents very interesting possibilities for meaning in the film, with the character Hatchet Harry being the epitomal representation for masculinity: A powerful man who sits atop his sex shop in his second-story office.  Yet I believe that while the film begins to glorify masculinity, the ending denounces it.  However if you're not one for reading into film, I believe this movie carries with it an amazing story with unpredictable plot twists.  Guy Ritchie has a very difinitive style that is easy to fall in love with, as well as a dark sense of humor that can be easily admired.",

Those were all films with ""rave reviews"", but I can't say I truly enjoyed any of them.  One of the things that irritated me was the accents.  They were hard to follow sometimes and it often interfered with my understanding of the plot.

As it isn't until the end that the many plots all come together, like with Pulp Fiction it is a movie you can watch numerous times and it only gets funnier.

I dont know if that was precisely the case for Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. However, this movie is a lesson in film making.
This Guy Ritchie classic is experimental in many ways. The way it tells the story, the cuts, the camera angles and the script, it all feels fresh for a 1998 film. In many ways this film has changed the way films got made thereafter. I believe an entire generation is indebted to Guy Ritchie for changing storytelling, camera angles and scripts in cinema forever. The story of a few small time crooks and some gangsters and how their actions cross each others paths. This could be made into a serious drama. But throw in a brilliant script, loads of humour, some impeccable coming timing and an outstanding yet brave direction and what you get is a laugh riot, you wish, never ends.

Yeah the movie is violent, but that's the point. And the action is awesome, something that Guy Ritchie does like no one else. But the movie is also funny and ironic. Plus it's got Sting playing a bad@$$ and was the film that launched Jason Staham as a popular actor in America...if only he could pick some better movies (how many Transporters are there now, like 10?) If you haven't seen this movie, find it and BUY it. You'll never get tired of watching it. Even the second or third or fiftieth time you see it you'll still be surprised and pleased.

Though i loved the way the Guy Ritchie, put all the intro and the characters into perspective, what really impressed me was an equally amazing conclusion and summing up of the movie.. The direction and the execution of the movie was superb and like most of the movies with a great script loose track in the middle of the movie, this kept the pace and fun going through out..

It just shows you how well a low budget Independent film can be and how you can really make a film on your own and make it a masterpiece. I'm 13 years old and my dream is to grow up and make independent films that have reminisce of people like Guy Ritchie, Quentin Tarantino, Richard Linklater, Kevin Smith, Robert Rodriguez, exc. So, if you watch this film, make sure to have a big bowl of popcorn and a sense of humour. If you have these two things, you are sure to be amazed!!!",

Well, I was most certainly wrong. They can, and Lock Stock Two Smoking Barrels has. The array of its dynamic scene proportion is just amazing. At first you can barely follow the storyline since there are so many characters present and so many plots, that keep getting more and more complex. But as the time passes, it all comes to logical disentanglement. Camera moves strictly according to the momentary state of the character in momentum.",

I've taken time to handle it properly, as this is understandably a cult classic and has warranted a lot of good reviews.",

The characters are all superbly cast and the sepia camera effect adds to the gritty realism of the story. But this is no serious drama, oh no. It's so damn funny at times that you don't know whether to wince at the violence or to split your sides laughing. I opt for the latter, but then I have watched it many times and the violent bits don't surprise me any more. However the funny bits just get funnier with each viewing.",

The movie had me rolling around on the ground in stitches as it seemingly went from one funny scene and piece of dialogue to another. Another surprising fact was the movie was full of a bunch of relative unknown actors, besides Sting if he counts, and they all pulled of their parts brilliantly with plenty of depth. Perhaps most impressively for myself though was how the plot lines in the movie intertwine themselves into one final climatic conclusion that no viewer could possibly be disappointed with. Highly recommend this movie it is an absolute surprise and treat. If only more comedies were being made of this quality.",
395,22 February 1999,Joe-144,9," Wodehouse farce, but with more blood","People have complained about this for being sub-Tarantino but it's not at all like, say, Reservoir Dogs; it just looks that way because of the blood and the swearing. At heart this is a P G Wodehouse-type farce with antique guns instead of cow-creamers and dodgy back-room clubs instead of Picadilly gentlemens' clubs. Lots of running around and shouting keeps the pace lively and the jokes - and all-important set-ups - are genuinely funny. This film comes as such a relief after the anodyne sentimentality of Sliding Doors and the pseudo-intellectual witticisms of Shakespeare in Love (they were funny in their own way, but their own way can be a bit annoying). It's so great to see the old music-hall farce routines united with the modern gritty shoot-em-up so harmoniously, and that the result is still funny is really something to admire.",

It is almost impossible to dislike these rude boys from the very beginning. They are a bunch of most lively, funny and at the same time naive guys. The affair they got involved in grows and grows with almost every minute. Twists of action almost make it impossible to follow the plot, I have not seen such a ""swift"" movie in ages.

This has to be the best comedy of the year with out a doubt, but I think you have to have a very British sense of humour. Not as violent as you might expect but the language is a bit strong. The plot is not to complex a load of Eastend villains robbing from each other and beating each other up. One of the best scenes (without giving any of the plot away) is when a barman is describing an event to a customer in very broad Cockney and sub titles pop up explaining what he is saying. Very good cameo roles from Vinny Jones and Sting. If you want a good laugh and forget about everything for a couple of hours I recommend this film.",

The movie starts with a bang and doesn't let up till the credits, with a number of plots weaving and dodging at a hundred miles an hour and finally resolving in a metaphoric firey collision at the end. The movie has a gritty realism derived from the consistent visuals, and pumping sound track. If you liked Pulp Fiction (and maybe even if you didn't), you'll love this.",

What should have been a crime underworld action movie was a comedic action film with enough twists to confuse the best of movie goers. The story is a great view into the older British crime machine. The actors make that story come to life in such a beautiful way. The cinematography brings you right into all of the action. Four Young criminals getting in way over their head in a world they are only aware of on the peripheral. Does this movie end with a happy ending? You have to watch the movie and wonder. This is a film that must be seen more than once. There is narration that should be listened to and action so fast paced that hitting the rewind button may be the right thing to do.,

Too many cutting shots, changing of (point-of) views that are unnecessary. Some of them seem like they're just there for showing off (see the carrot under water shot). In addition to this, the first and second halves of this movie are almost completely different. The first half had some really bad acting and was extremely boring. I found myself almost dozing off a couple of times. The second half, though, completely rocks. It's funny and just has a great script. I really enjoyed the last 45 minutes-1 hour. Because the writing and acting got so much better, the over-directing wasn't noticed as much. Thanks to this I came out of the theater having a good impression of this film. 6 stars",

You may have to be English to appreciate the humor, but a lot of my American friends enjoyed it in the same sense that they like Bottom and Red Dwarf.

Everything ties together in ways that are, at the same time, coincidental and seemingly planned. Guy Ritchie achieves the same effect in ""Snatch."" Please, if you are reading this before seeing the film, try it. You will love it. Pay attention the multitude of characters, as they flow in and out.

The film is about four geezers from the east end who get in to a bit of trouble with the local gangland boss and have to come up with half a million quid in a week. The script is brilliant the story line full of twists and add that to a really talented cast of actors and you've got a real classic.

After years and years of Hollywood, this movie was so refreshing and creative, not to mention hilarious. Lock, Stock is probably one of my favorites of all time, not because it's one of those ""great movies"", but because it's just so entertaining to watch. Guy Ritchie is a wicked director, he has style and flash without using lots of money or special effects. I've heard some people argue that Lock, Stock is similar to Pulp Fiction, and Ritchie to Tarantino. I don't really agree with this. Pulp Fiction was an interesting and important movie for Hollywood, but not one I would watch more than once or twice. It wasn't even very funny. Lock, Stock on the other hand, is extremely entertaining and hilarious. Ritchie's style is cool and unique, even if he was inspired by Tarantino. Whatever the case, the world could use more great directors like this. I gave Lock, Stock a 10/10. Go see this movie if you haven't done so yet, you'll be glad you did.",

If you like that sort of stuff of course. Tongue-in-a-cheek, smart, comedy-action-crime story with brilliant script and great camera work. The characters are mostly all idiots, but they all have their charm. Or at least something. You can't help but wonder how you yourself would act in a situation like this - although surely, no viewer could be as stupid as the characters in the film. Well, stupid is probably a bit strong. Naive perhaps. In any case, the story is brilliantly told, you keep rooting for the good guys, and for ... ahem... some less good ones as well.

Complaints about accent, language, and most telling of all inability to follow the story (speaks volumes about their ability to follow anything but the most simple of Hollywood rubbish).

Confidential"", and thought, ""Wow, that was fantastic"", but I didn't rush out and buy them as soon as they became available on DVD or VHS. So why did I and so many others leg it to the shop on 1st March to buy Lock Stock and watch it over and over again? Many people will say that a film was ""pure entertainment"", and you should expect no more from an action movie. Well, nope, that's not what Lock Stock is about. What does it have then? It has a cast that give an authentic feel, if not Oscar winning performances. It has a black humour, a little overdone in places, but one that generally works well and seems to fit in with the characters and their location (i.e. you can only take cockney rhyming slang so seriously). It has a tugging, friendly plotline, that wrong foots your emotions once or twice and pokes you in the stomach, without ever *really* being twisty. It has an inconsiderate bass line, but only where your neighbours are concerned (it's great). It has Lenny McLean (RIP Lenny). It has an armoury of lines that you'll quote to your mates for weeks on end, to a point where they'll go out and  buy the film just so they know what the hell you're talking about.

So with the obvious similarities aside, it is safe to say that Guy Ritchie's movie has brought new life and new twists to the genre, and succeeded where so many other clones have failed.  Some of the reviews I read before seeing this movie complained of a plotline too complicated and dialogue too accent thick as hindrances to understanding the movie.  Three things, first of all, don't underestimate the audience, I had no trouble following the plotline. Anyone who watches Seinfeld, with its separate plotlines coming together at the end, will get it.  The accents I got used to quickly, Amercian audiences loved Trainspotting which had even thicker accents, so that's not a problem. Lastly, complete understanding of the plotline is secondary in a movie like this.  This movie is about comedy, high-energy fun and Ritchie's innovative style that, instead of coming off as showy and unnecessary, puts the right frame around things and keeps the eyes glued to the screen and the butts in the seats.",

It starts slow, admittedly, but once it's going, it's a runaway train. I've watched it three times in the past two weeks, and like it more each time. The characters are detailed and believable, the dialogue, while unusual, is original and hilarious, and the plot is nothing short of tangled. Highly recommended. I've heard it referred to (MAXIM, January 2000) as the British ripoff of Pulp Fiction. Whoever wrote that obviously never saw Pulp Fiction, or perhaps wasn't properly medicated at the time of the review. LS&2SB is an excellent first effort by Guy Ritchie and I anxiously await his next film.",

454,6 August 2011,BjaminDS-1,10," A Crazy, Twisting Crime Comedy","This is one of my favorite films. Guy Ritchie's writing is nearly perfect in this comedy of coincidences, that aren't really coincidences, but are instead the inevitable result of the multiple story lines meshing together perfectly in this dark comedy. The movie is fragmented initially, but this is required in order to establish each of the rich stories and characters that go along with them. Everything fits together so well that I cannot help but smile as the film unfolds. Ritchie's directing is very stylish and amazing to watch, particularly in the various montages that combine inverted camera movements and still images with a remarkable effect. The accompanying music is fantastic as well. This is absolutely a must see for any fan of the crime genre.",
455,14 April 2003,alig2003,10, Basic Outline of the film and my opinion,"Guy Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is one of the most well crafted crime/comedy/action films I have ever seen. The use of the narrator enables all characters within the film to be properly introduced. This includes the main four characters, Tom (Jason Flemyng), Bacon (Jason Statham), Soap (Dexter Fletcher) and Eddie (Nick Moran) to the supporting characters such as Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) and Barry the Baptist (Lenny ""The Guv'nor"" McLean). What makes Lock, Stock such a great film is the way Ritchie weaves his characters and the plot so that they all cross paths in the end. Eddie enters a card game against Hatchet Harry on behalf of himself, Tom, Bacon and Soap and ends up owing half a million pounds. While at the same time Dog, with Plank and crew rob the weed growers Winston, Willy and Charles. As it happens Dog and his crew live next to Eddie and Bacon. Eddie overhears them and decides to rob them in order to pay off his debt to Harry. Also included are Harry's debt collector Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) and Harry's bodyguard Barry the Baptist , Criminal head honcho Rory Breaker (Vas Blackwood), stolen goods dealer Nick the Greek and Eddie's Dad Jd (Sting). Through sheer luck and at times utter stupidity, all those included get their paths well and truly crossed which makes for an excellent final scene.",
456,5 November 2022,bigben2390,10, Follow hatchet Harry,If you are watching this movie for the first time just recognize that the plot revolves around hatchet harry in the first 75% of the film. Follow harry and don't flick any birds' nests. It pays the cost to be the boss. Possibly the best guy Ritchie movie of all time. If you like a movies that has like 4 different plays that all come together then you'll like this movie. Jason Stratham isn't even the main character lol. I can't even remember if he was in anything before this: seriously my favorite movie of all time. If you like this movie then I also recommend Snatch. Is this enuf chrecters????,

458,21 January 2005,ajcourt,9," Lock, Stock and One Fantastic Movie","This movie done by Guy Ritchie (known for marrying Madonna) is a very well put together movie. It is the Pulp Fiction equivalent for the United Kingdom. The movie gains credibility with a simple card game totaling a very large debt for four young lads, who have to pay it off in one week. The movie is awesome filming multiple stories that all culminate and crossover for the climax of the film. LS and 2SB is full of cockney slang you will never comprehend but add to the allure of the British caper gone horribly wrong. The selected actors are fantastic and I understand why Guy Ritchie would hire them again and again. Guy Ritchie is an excellent writer/director and will hopefully continue as time goes on.",

In just under an hour and 45 minutes it will throw you into a corner of London, dominated by thugs, drugs, violence and Cockney slang that you'll never want to leave.

The way the camera fits in with the mood of the scene, music, and actors is with such perfect coordination, its easy to forget your're watching a TV screen. On a side note, the music was good too. The story is about 4 crooks in London trying to get something more out of life. They try to beat cards with local crime kingpin Harry, but fate turns against them, and they have to get £500,000 in 7 days, or face nasty consequences. This sparks an entire trail of events, flipping over from one person with their goals to the next, all coming together in the end for an explosive ending, which will leave you dumbfounded. Take it from me, when you and your friends are just really bored, get this movie and watch it with them.",

Not because it is going to change my life, or because I've discovered some nebulous truths about humanity, but because I enjoyed myself while in the cinema. Why should a film make you think and ponder and cry anyway? It seems to me that movies that go for these responses, and particularly for the crying bit, are usually the province of a bunch of arrogant and presumptuous directors out to control other people. Lock, Stock and 2SB is an honestly funny and amusing film. Without pretension it managed to make my night after a hard day of study go by a little better.

If you are one the the many people who like low budget, good story lines, then don't miss ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"".  It has all the elements necessary to complete the quirky, comedic, dark script. You laugh at violence and howl at misfortune, one of the best I've seen in about 2 years, but you must like this type of movie to truly enjoy all of its oddities.  I like to say that Pulp Fiction is a great movie I can't recommend because certain people can't get past the violence, but this movie is not as graphic.  However, if you have trouble understanding cockney accents, it could be a tough watch.  The accents didn't bother me, but I have always loved any accent from the United Kingdom.

I saw part of one TV ad for this movie and I was barely convinced to go out and see it.  I think a reason that so many of the bad reviews for this movie came from Europeans and the good ones from Americans is because Americans think it's funny to hear a one-liner in a foreign accent as opposed to a native one.  I'm not above this and I found the whole movie hilarious.  Aside from the clever writing, the way the movie was played out made it hilarious as well.  The ending was a perfect example.

It's a refreshing change from the kind of unoriginal Hollywood action films that are always released.  The plot is so confusing it took loads of people two times to understand it, and the way it portrays Cockney Gangsters is brilliant.  Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) is the best character, followed by the Traffic Warden, and the two useless fat gangsters who initially steal the antique shotguns.

The dialogue is quick and funny.  Even in the most serious parts Ritchie delivers a bit of quick wit and makes us laugh.  The washed out look of many shots and the liberal use of slow motion and freeze frames really work in the movie as opposed to becoming an impediment on the flow.  The actors all do a really good job especially the guy who plays Big Chris.   Having Sting in it makes the movie even more bad ass, even if he only has a very bit part.  I really liked this movie.  In fact I liked it so much that the day I went to return the rental I bought my own copy.",

Anyway, the movie is very intense, deals with relatively 'sensitive' subjects, but is also great fun. I'm actually sorry for the guys who didn't get what the movie was about, and that it's been hard to follow the story .... please go out and get yourself a comic and forget about the movies, that actually have a storyline.

The first time I watched it, I was a little confused, and it took me about half way through the movie to finally interpret their accent's, but after that it was a splendid film. The second time I watched it, I was just in pure awe.  The accent came a lot better to understand, along with the story detail.  To use a 90's cliche, this movie was done similar the the ""Quentin Tarantino"" effect, with the backwards way of unraveling some of the story, which added to the suspense. The story starts off unraveling the backgrounds of the 4 main charecters, and the sub-charecters of the movie.  Then we begin to learn the amazing plot:  A young brazen Poker player is going to be playing for big money on a table with more big money.  The gig is, he is ""borrowing"" money from his friends as an investment for them, potentially gaining 2 times what they put in.  From there on, the story unfolds in a tragic sort of way, with scenes of a rabid drug dealer, to 3 Potheads armed with a BB gun!  This movie is one of my top 3 of all time, no matter what anyone says.",
479,3 January 2012,matt_dawber,7, A brilliant British film,"A wonderful blend of sharp witty humor, plenty of twists that are sure to leave you trying to keep up (and even pausing the movie for a couple of moments just to make sure you actually are up to speed on the whole plot), and of course Guy Ritchie's undeniable style that will capture and enthrall your attention, which always gives his films such a unique feel to them only adding to the overall enjoyment. Oh and some violence thrown in for good measure (what's a good gangster film without violence?). the actors did a convincing job for not being very well known in fact they did a much better job than most of the actors you see in modern films these days. And the story was absolutely hilarious! Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a heist film involving four friends owing a grand some of half a million pounds to a local gangster after he rigs a card game. And now they have only one week to come up with the money or else... and so begins the start of many schemes and brilliant twists that make up this film and only add to the dark hilarity proving it very difficult not to laugh. Even though the humor is much more darker than your average flick (but really is that a bad thing) Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a great Guy Ritchie film and a brilliant debut showcasing his skills in directing a very enjoyable film. Although it might not be quite as good as Snatch (though Brad Pitt was a huge disappointment) but definitely a favorite of mine even if the accents can be hard to understand. Well worth the rent if you've never seen it before I highly recommend it.",

I'd urge anyone to see it and then to see it again. NB: If you want to sound cool when you're talking about the movie with friends, call it 'Lock Stock"" instead of saying the full title.",

The film follows a large and varied cast of characters (all well casted and very interesting) who are eventually brought together in a humorous tangle of robbery and murder due to their illicit ways. The direction is great accompanied by some rather simple, yet highly effective cinematography. The story never drags. In fact, it is quite compelling. If you're used to American films, that is to say, you've never really sat down and watched any movie remotely foreign, than I must highly suggest this movie as a wonderful change of pace.

It blatantly pokes fun at America's tendency to ideolize the 'Bad Boy' image, at the same time making you realize that the same petty, yet 'crime of the century' criminal ideologies are happening he world over. If you want to see the British version of 'Goodfella's', then rent ""Gangster #1"", but in the meantime, ""Lock, Stock"" is full of violence and most importantly in today's society, laughs.

509,23 August 1999,William-41,8, Buy it. You better buy it!,Lock Stock has much to offer and will go down as a classic of British film. Guy Ritchie's first outing to the world of feature films is one that exudes a talent long lost (hard to find!) in the world of hollywood.,
510,25 August 2000,jontvr,9, Fed up with Tarantino comparisons,"Why is it that any modern film that is slightly avant garde and contains more than one plot is instantly compared to a Tarantino production? Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a highly original film, as are Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but that's where the similarities end.",

513,24 January 2001,ahgrimes,10, Amazing,"No matter how many times I see this film, it never fails to deliver the goods. I first bought this on the recommendation of a friend. I had just got a DVD player and he said ""Get Lock Stock"". So I bought it. It is still the most watched film out of my collection. The soundtrack is excellent. Like Quentin Tarantinos films, Lock stock has songs from the sixties through to the nineties. Which is why it will appeal to everyone. If you havent seen this film I suggest you do and decide for yourself. And the twist towards the end just makes the film perfect. Watch it!",

515,7 May 2001,blot1,7, Funnier and More Likeable Than Tarantino,"For at least the first half hour, it seems like each scene introduces about ten new characters, many of whom are very similar looking and acting. But after that it really did grow on me. The soundtrack helps immensely. And once I figured out all the scams and which character was which, I got into the spirit of it and it had me laughing and shaking my head the rest of the way.",
516,15 January 2007,wee_sean-g,8, An Ultimate An Classic Movie,"This is one of the best movies ever it has a great blend of black comedy along with some classic violent scenes, mixed with some funny and weird characters which had me in stitches, its unlike any other movies and is one of a kind - although pulp fiction has similar black comedy through out - they are miles apart even though there both ace. Every scene is exciting and class, Vinnie Jones is partciullary good in lock stock and his scenes are ace. It also has a quality soundtrack to go along with that - stone roses, ocean colour scene, James brown etc. It is a great watch. I dwelled on whether to give it a ten out of ten but I decided a nine is more than fair.",

518,24 May 2023,akhimiaetyiodgjkxvbnryu,9, be full of praise,"The plot of the great reincarnation is full of praise. The score is incredibly impressive. The close-up shows even the slightest hint of pore residue. Sitting precariously on the corner of the mouth where various laughter materials echoed, searching for the yellowed and creaking teeth that had been smoked, they were about to slip out of this mouth. The handsome man's stern, indulgent, yet agonizing face was the one who laughed to the point of disappointment. After taking risks, young people will never think that all of this is just the beginning of entanglement. If it doesn't disappoint me, I like a good movie that makes you laugh and nervous.",
519,24 January 2016,stefan-cos,10," Very ,Verry dynamics,fun and good film","One of the most popular gay Richie""s films for now. After this film you should be watching immediately snatch, and all his other films, no problem. If you enjoy this movie, I ashore you ,that you can watch ,every his next movie, except the last movie man from U: C: L; E. The film can be watched several times.

Everything is interfered, dope, gambling, crime, fraud on fraud, and all that so well tangled, actor's both good and bad are very good performances. So, what can i say except to watch this movie if you not All i can say is that i actually love this one maybe the most. cheers and i wish you nice watching enjoy.",

523,26 December 2003,LDW051290,9, good,Lock stock and two smoking barrels is funny and witty. Unexpected plot twists. Guy Ritchie really has a flare for unforgettable movies/characters. The four actors did a splendid job bring their characters on to the screen. For Jason Stathams first movie picture he did an extremely great job. This is an all around good movie.,

525,1 March 2012,dylan-kerr,9, Four neighbourhood gangsters get in too deep,"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is a fast paced, witty, hilarious film in where Guy Ritchie made his first big hit and showed to the world that he knew what he was about. The film starts off introducing these four guys who entrust their friend Tom (Jason Flemyng) with a hundred thousand dollars to go and play a game of cards with the local mob boss, Hatchet Harry. Little does Tom know, Hatchet Harry cheats at the game, and makes a deal with Tom saying he would front him the money to continue the round of poker, and when the cards are turned, Tom loses, and now him and his three other friends are in debt half a million pounds to one of the most fearsome mobsters in town.",

527,14 April 2020,rushfeldt-tale,7, A highly entertaining movie to watch.,"This was a highly entertaining Guy Ritchie-movie to watch! The editing was very good, with lots of stylistics shots. The music was superb, which added to the flavour of the movie. There were a lots of unique characters, although it was a little bit difficult to keep track of who was who, but I guess if you see it a second time it will be easier. I would absolutely recommend it!",
528,30 August 2004,phobos-7,10," Aside from Pulp Fiction, the Best Pulp movie around!","Are you a fan of Pulp movies? You know... the outrageous and dark stuff, but somehow generally amusing? Murder. Revenge. Seduction. Drugs. Well, if you liked Pulp Fiction, or are just a big fan of the Pulp and Independent film genre, this is the movie for you. With better than seven different groups of people looking out for their own interests while destryoing others, it's a must see; but don't worry about it being overdone - it's a perfect balance: outrageous, but somewhat probable. It's original with great elements of humor and drama and action. The confusion of interlocking stories keeps you on your toes. And the ending is priceless... a true Guy Richie classic. I happened upon it by accident, and I've loved it ever since. Stop reading this and go buy it. Don't even bother borrowing it, you'll just buy it in the end... I know I did!",

Not only a film with brilliant actors but also one with a great story and the climax is surprising. Comparing this movie to Snatch, I have to say that this one offers a lot more excitement and has a slightly better storyline. The music in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking barrels is excellent and really helps to increase the atmosphere in this film.",
530,9 August 2013,georgie-t81,8, Smokin',"A funny, enjoyable gangster film in which Ritchie manages to juggle the various characters and story lines effortlessly as they weave in and out. As Brit gangsters in over their heads after going heavily in debt to some hard men the roles were brilliantly acted as one bad decision leads to another until everyone is seriously out of their league. All the actors delivered stellar performances with Vinnie Jones being particularly good making you wish you got to see more of him. Always entertaining in Ritchie's unique style the script is as good as the filming and the violence is done to perfection. Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is gangster done right and one film I would definitely recommend.",

A low budget but extremely well acted and directed movie.""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a gangster comedy with complex plot, dark humour and memorable characters. Writer-director Guy Ritchie did great on this, it's his first film. He is probably my favorite new director. It is a clear recommendation for everybody who enjoys good gangster films with humorous aspects, and if you liked Tarantino's films, this is a suggestion.",
532,6 March 2014,DegenErik,9, British comedy at it's best.,"A really good movie, great acting, interesting story and perfect music. Guy Ritchie did a great job. I watched it four times and every time it only got better. For anyone that likes crime comedies, it is perfect. Just like movies Snatch, Trainspotting or This is England. The first time I saw it I was astonished at how good the movie was. All the characters are well fit together to make a perfect circle of crime. A real masterpiece of funny and intelligent scenarios that put our anti- heroes in all kinds of awkward situations. Jason Statham and Jason Flemyng did a great job, I was really glad that they are in the movie, as well with Vinnie Jones who I think has become one of the most recognised faces as movie tough guy.",
533,9 June 2016,giacomo-91248,8, Many characters in a strange situation,"Great movie about crime,violence,humor,peoples and drug. We can see many see in this movie about friendship and intelligence. Great cast,directing and screenplay. Beautiful the photography especially especially the great and awesome city of London. The mixture of comedy and violence was the thing that most amused me. It take many minutes to understand the plot, but when you get it you will be catch in the strange atmosphere. The director Guy Ritchie is is very very good to make us a wonderful story about criminals and murders, with many guns and murders . Many characters in a strange situation and in a strange story is what make this story awesome , intelligent and very very very good",

536,10 September 2021,stijnlef,8, great,"Great acting, great comedy. This reminds me a bit of a tarantino film which i really like. I love films that are shot on film and have a grainy look, but this one was a little to grainy for me and had just to much of a yellow high contrast tint. Also a problem i did have with this film was that there were so many people with there own little story, that you would sometimes forget who was who, and what they were actually doing. Although all the stories did come together in the end, so that would clear it up a bit. I love how you are most on the edge of your seat at the end of the film, because its a comedic scene and not an action scene.",
