0,11 April 2005,nycritic,10, What an Action Thriller Should Be.,"VERTIGO did nothing to advance Hitchcock's career in 1957 when he released it, and it's actually not a shame: the following year he decided to go completely against the slow-moving erotic thriller genre and do something shamelessly commercial, escapist and single-handedly create the spy movie. Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond novels, states he based his character on the physical characteristics and the suave personality of Cary Grant, as an added note. This could well amount to be the first James Bond film -- a dangerous villain complete with a sidekick, an alluring woman with a dubious nature and an enigmatic ""boss,"" a dashing hero, lush locales setting the scene for powerful chases and escalating danger.",/
1,30 October 2005,jotix100,10, Strangers on a train,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" is one of the best films in his long and distinguished career. Part of the success of the movie lies in the screen play by Ernest Lehman, one of the best writers of that era. Also, the haunting music by Mr. Hitchcock's usual collaborator, Bernard Hermann, adds texture to what we are seeing. Together with all the above mentioned qualities, ""North by Northwest"" was photographed by Robert Burks and was edited by George Tomasini, both men did outstanding jobs to enhance a film that shows a mature and inspired Alfred Hitchcock.",r
2,9 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9, Enormously entertaining film from Alfred Hitchcock!,"My favourite director, Alfred Hitchcock has directed many classics like Psycho, Rear Window and Vertigo, and I will say that this deserves to be up there among his best. I absolutely loved it! The best aspect of this movie is the always charming Cary Grant in a brooding and entertaining performance as Roger Thornhill, a man wanted for the murder of a diplomat. Solidly supporting him all the way are the lovely Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendell and oily James Mason as the villainous Vandamme. They are further advantaged by some excellent camera-work and a wonderfully atmospheric music score. The script is focused and suspenseful, and Hitchcock's direction ensures the film rarely slips, even if some of the complicated plot does fly over people's heads. The climax though is simply the icing on the cake. Overall, a hugely enjoyable film, which I will give a 9.5/10. Bethany Cox",e

4,24 July 2004,Ben_Cheshire,8, I finally get how great it is: Hitch infuses his wrong-man caper with ironic movie language and reality-be-damned escapism and suspense.,"Its Hitch's most briskly entertaining movie, and one of his most comic, adventure-caper type movies, largely thanks to the persona of Cary Grant. But its also one of his most suspenseful - in the fact that Grant is being recognised as someone else, and that he may be put in jail for someone else's crime.",i

6,10 November 2003,slokes,8," Smoke and mirrors, without apologies","The one famous gaffe people point out in this film is when a small boy can be seen plugging his ears just before Eva Marie Saint brings her café conversation with Cary Grant to a sudden end. Another gaffe, just as egregious and apparent but not nearly as commented on, is when Cary and Eva, clutching an incriminating statute, are rock-climbing around a quartet of famous presidential heads until a bad guy suddenly appears and leaps upon him. Whereupon the surprised, backward-falling Cary has the presence of mind to hand the statute to Eva, who takes his from him whilst in mid-scream. Do me a favor and read that last sentence again. What director today would allow such a scene past the editing room?",w
7,25 December 2000,movieman9,10, Top-notch suspense /adventure film still looks great after 40 years!,"For Christmas this year, I received my first to-own DVD: Hitchcock's classic, NORTH BY NORTHWEST. After over 40 years, this rip-racing adventure-thriller still packs a punch and looks great on widescreen. This movie came along during a renaissance period for the Old Master, between masterpieces like VERTIGO and PSYCHO, but this excursion into the world of suspense is so different from anything else Hitchcock had created up to that point. Never did he challenge our endurance to keep still in our seats for such a long period of time, and yet the film's 135 minutes go by so fast it could only be explained by movie magic itself.",/

A brisk screenplay by Ernest Lehman a Cary Grant that is just pure delight, Eva Marie Saint fresh out of her Oscar from ""On the Waterfront"" is an icy blonde with a brain. James Mason, the ultimate foreign sinister not to mention Jessie Royce Landis and Hitchcock brings Bernard Herrmann to wrap it all up in one of the most infectious scores imaginable. A real treat.",r
9,23 April 2008,ags123,10, A towering achievement.,"This is Hitchcock's best film  quite an accomplishment, considering how many great films he created. And after half a century, ""North By Northwest"" holds up beautifully. This film has it all: suspense, glamour, humor, and images that capture the imagination and remain etched in memory. The legendary crop-dusting sequence alone is a master class in the art of pure cinema. Like the rest of the film, it's brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed. All the elements come together to produce the finest form of entertainment. Bernard Herrmann's frantic fandango captures the complexity and pace of the action. Ernest Lehman's script is full of sophisticated dialogue. Performances are spot on. Has Cary Grant ever been more engaging? Is James Mason the ultimate in charming villains? And Eva Marie Saint's allure is multi-faceted. Movies just don't get better than this.",w

11,7 February 2004,dtb,10, From The Master of Suspense Came the Daddy of the Modern Adventure Thrillers,"Many feel this is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest American movie, and I agree! NORTH BY NORTHWEST is the Hitchcock film to end all Hitch films, with all his pet themes covered with maximum wit, panache, and suspense, as well as a romance between Cary Grant and a soignée Eva Marie Saint that's as tender as it is sexy. Grant has never been more engaging and dashing (literally and figuratively :-), though the smoothly villainous James Mason nearly out-suaves him. My husband and I have joked that if Mason had played Thornhill, the film would have been over in mere moments. With all due respect to Grant, if the imperious, unshakably confident Mason asked the Glen Cove police, ""Do you honestly believe that this happened the way you think it did?"" they would immediately reply, ""No, sir, you must be right, you're free to go, sorry we bothered you."" :-) Also boasts a great early performance by a reptilian young Martin Landau as Mason's possessive henchman, as well as one of Oscar nominee Ernest Lehman's best screenplays (in fact, he borrowed liberally from it for his script for the film version of THE PRIZE starring Paul Newman) and one of Bernard Herrmann's finest scores. Anybody who wants to write or direct a chase thriller should watch NORTH BY NORTHWEST first to see how it's done!",1

13,30 May 2008,johnny-08,8, Great script and Hitchcock's genius direction makes this film interesting even today,"Today, when technology is getting advanced by every new day, movie scenes like the one on Mount Rushmore in ""North by Northwest"" looks very funny, but I must admit that this movie is great even from todays perception. One of Alfred Hitchcock's best movies has his favorite actor Cary Grant in it, blonde girl Eva Marie Saint and excellent actors like James Mason & Martin Landau. So to say long story short; I enjoyed in this movie and I'm 'only' 19 years old (this movie was made almost 50 years ago!!!). Why? Because of great scenes coming from genius Alfred Hitchcock, brilliant script that makes this movie a great thriller, with twists, good performances and some comedic parts (coming from Cary Grant and Jessie Royce Landis). So if you have opportunity, watch this movie cause it's a classic.",4

The tale is ordinary Hitchcock fare that plays and preys the senses , as a hapless New York advertising executive , Roger Thornhill, (Gary Grant got $450,000 -a substantial amount for the time - plus a percentage of the gross profits ; though Yul Brynner and William Holden was suggested to play him) is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies (James Mason , Martin Landau) and is pursued across the country while he looks for a way to survive . Grant is chased by both : the patrolmen who think he's a killer and a spy ring who think he is a double agent .

I had such fond remembrances of seeing it on the big screen when I was young teen. I remember being terrified when Cary Grant was being chased by the crop duster and then awed at the end with the climactic scene on Mount Rushmore.

Cary Grant, in his final collaboration with Hitch, is aces as a Madison Avenue adman who, by sheer chance, is mistaken as a spy by nefarious types including a debonair James Mason and a creepy Martin Landau. He's also framed for murder, and therefore pursued by the cops, while trying to locate the elusive ""George Kaplan"" who can supposedly help extricate him from the mess. Grant also finds the time to fall in love with a classic elegant blonde Hitchcock leading lady in the form of Eva Marie Saint.",/
18,1 January 2018,frankwiener,9, Mr. Thornhill's Thorny Ordeal,"Wedged between the making of two very serious, psychological suspense films, ""Vertigo"" and ""Psycho"", director Alfred Hitchcock created a very different kind of thriller, one consisting largely of comedy, both subtle and obvious, thanks in part to the talent of scriptwriter, Ernest Lehman. Hitchcock and Lehman started with three seemingly unrelated ideas, (1) a mistaken identity, (2) a chase scene through the United Nations, and (3) a spectacular finale at Mount Rushmore. They then wove these three events into one cohesive story, a fascinating creative process by itself.",?
19,13 May 2017,writtenbymkm-583-902097,3, absolutely unbelievable,"SPOILER ALERT, please do not read this unless you've seen the movie. Let me assure all you Hitchcock lovers that I also love Hitchcock. Some of my favorite thrillers are Psycho, Rear Window, and Family Plot. I realize you have to ""suspend your disbelief"" to a certain extent. But I found most of the story in North by Northwest absolutely unbelievable. Spoilers follow. I don't understand why the bad guys jumped to the conclusion that Cary Grant was the spy they were after, a spy they'd never even seen. I don't understand why Cary Grant didn't just start yelling and screaming as they abducted him in front of a big crowd of people. I don't understand why the bad guys decided to kill him, not by merely shooting him, but by bothering to force booze down his throat and putting him behind the wheel of a car, or how he was able to drive at all (rather than passing out). I don't understand why the police didn't find out whose house it was (the U.N. diplomat) and then wonder why anyone was there. I don't understand how the blonde knew which train Cary Grant would take, how she knew who he was (so she could pay someone to have him seated at her table in the club car), and why she helped him at all. I don't understand how a large crowd could witness a diplomat being stabbed by someone throwing a knife, then conclude that Cary Grant did it, or why Cary Grant (the ultimate stupidity) would pull the knife out of the diplomat's back and hold it up for everyone to see. Or why, once he was a hunted man, he did absolutely nothing to alter his physical appearance. I don't understand (skipping forward a bit to shorten my review) why the blonde sent Cary Grant to what should've been his certain death, and why, when he survived and saw her again, it didn't even bother him. I don't understand why the bad guys used such an absurdly contrived means of attempting to kill him again, having a crop duster fly at him, instead of (again) just shooting him. I don't understand why the crop duster pilot couldn't avoid flying his plane into a truck. I don't understand why the bad guys were hanging out in an open house that anyone could get into. And I don't understand how Cary Grant and the blonde (or anyone else) could possibly cling to the monuments with nothing but their bare hands and not fall to their deaths. So, with apologies to everyone who ate this up and loved it, I couldn't believe or understand any of these things.",r

21,28 September 2022,daoldiges,8, Elegant & Fun,"North by Northwest is one of Hitchcock most purely entertaining films from his long filmography. Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, and a quiet Martin Landau are all very effective in their respective roles. I read some reviews that felt some of the material seemed dated? I wholeheartedy disagree and will leave that at that. Yes, I will agree that there are a couple 'glitches' in the story continuity, but they are not enough to seriously derail everything else around them. All the iconic scenes are still iconic. From the opening credits, to the score and the visuals throughout, North by Northwest is still as fun and entertaining as ever.",f
22,25 September 2009,dbborroughs,7, Good but not quite one of the greatest films of all time,"Considered one of the best of Hitchcock's films I find that I'm not that big a fan of the film. Its not that it's a bad movie, rather I think that the film has been ripped off and re-staged so many times that any power the film might have had is rather dissipated. Its kind of like watching Citizen Kane or some other film that is said to have changed the way movies are done and finding that they don't play all that well. The reason is, like North by Northwest that they changed the rules and have been so copied it hard to see what was so revolutionary about them. As it stands now the story of Cary Grant being mistaken for someone else and having to flee from both the police and the bad guys is exciting, especially in its set pieces, but the rest of it isn't anything special and has the feel of been there and done that especially when compared with Hitchcock's other films. Most certainly worth seeing, just be prepared to wonder what all the shouting is about.",_

24,12 September 2018,SendiTolver,10, They said I led too dull a life.,"One can argue about is 'North by Northwest' the best movie in the long list of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces, but it is definitely his most entertaining one. Escapist and unrealistic, sure, but all the characters, their motivations, actions and events depicted on the screen are believable in their own universe that Hitchcock directed based on Ernest Lehman's screenplay. The dialogue is witty and filled with amusing innuendos, and although it might seem that it is all game for the characters, the imminent threat is always present, and doesn't give the viewer (or the characters) too much time to rest from head spinning action. One aspect that is truly amazing (especially for a film like this) is that none of the characters were irritating, especially those who were totally ignorant for the obvious - the police officers and main character's mother (Jessie Royce Landis - what a wonderful performance), who didn't take seriously one single word that Roger Thornhill said about his situation. ",t
25,7 March 2017,zkonedog,7, A Well-Constructed Spy Romp,"When it comes to Alfred Hitchcock pictures, his ""MacGuffin"" plot style is quite a bit overused (especially by today's standards). ""North By Northwest"" contains that same style of film-making. However, this film is so well-constructed otherwise that it still holds up well over time.",t
26,1 September 2022,richardchatten,10," ""Paging Mr Kaplan!""","After a couple of financial disappointments Hitchcock triumphantly bounced back with which if not his greatest film film is certainly the most entertaining, and marks the apogee of a series of chase thrillers dating back at least to 'The 39 Steps', and also marks the culmination of The Master's journey from Britain to the United States and from black & white to Vistavision and Technicolor. That it didn't collect a single Oscar the year 'Ben-Her' won thirteen is yet another reason it's impossible to take the Oscars seriously.",_

29,6 October 2018,gab-14712,9, Hitchcock's Most Entertaining Film!,"Over the course of his career, Alfred Hitchcock has made many highly-regarded works and every film of his was treated like an event. After a very successful decade of the 1950's which includes famed works such as Rear Window and Vertigo, Hitchcock closes out the decade with perhaps his greatest work, 1959's North by Northwest. After the dark erotic film that was Vertigo, Hitchcock decided to make something more fun, action/adventure-oriented, and something light-hearted in general. This film is essentially the first James Bond film, even though the first James Bond film would be produced several years later. This is an incredibly tense and suspenseful spy thriller that boasts two of the most memorable scenes in cinematic history-the crop duster scene and the dramatic rescue upon the rocks of Mount Rushmore. This film has lots of incredible talent working on camera and behind the scenes. In addition to Hitchcock, we have great acting from the likes of Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. The film was written by one of the greatest screenwriters of the era, Ernest Lehman. The film has a distinctive look because of Robert Burks's camerawork and texture is given to the sound of the movie because of the eerie score of Bernard Hermann's. ",v
30,14 November 2001,Gmanol01,10, Hitchcock keeps popping out the classics...,"When you thought that he's all out of ideas and last minute rescues, Hitchcock comes back with more eye candy and great action. North by Northwest is sometimes called Hitchcock's last great film. Carey Grant and Eva Marie Saint have very good chemistry and the inclusion of not one, not two, not three, but severa plot twists makes this film one of Hitchcock's best.",
31,28 October 2002,funkyfry,8, One of Hitch's better flicks,"Somewhat overblown suspense thriller has exciting plot twists and Cary Grant's unique screen presence to recommend it.  Well directed, tells the story of an advertising man mistaken for a decoy created by the CIA, who is hunted across the nation and ends up falling for the CIA's undercover agent -- Marie-Saint.  The ""Open paranoia"" scene in the cropdusting field is a great sequence.  Here Hitchcock succeeds often in not being obvious, remaining playful, and pleasing the audience a lot.",

33,10 January 2021,tcchelsey,10," ARGUEABLY, HITCHCOCK'S BEST EFFORT","There's a heck of a lot of debate over NORTH BY NORTHWEST as to where it stands among Hitchcock's greatest films. To tell you the truth, it has to be at the very top of the list, if not the first. There are innumerable classic scenes in this one that have gone to be Hollywood lore and will undoubtedly live on forever. One gem of a movie that without question was meticulously assembled and cast by the master of suspense, an inspiration to present and future film makers hands down. The best thing about any of Hitchcock's productions is the storyline, generally pitting the main character against all odds and just watching what happens to them. In this case, Cary Grant is mistaken, and rather simply, if not humorously, as a gent who some nefarious spies are very much interested in. The rest is up to him to prove otherwise and hopefully survive his ordeal. Black comedy at its best with some excellent characters to give him a run for his money, including James Mason as his unrelenting adversary, and the lovely Eva Marie Saint as the ""mystery woman"" with a few skeletons in her own closet, and perhaps needing him more than he needs her. It gets complicated, but that's the genius of Hitchcock that we all will always remember. Notably, there are always some delicious smaller roles that are navigated by some fine actors. Case in point, Jessie Royce Landis as Grant's wise-cracking mom, still treating him as if he were in high school, Martin Landau as a cold-blooded associate of Mason's (who you know is going to get his one way or another) and Leo G. Carroll as the man with an exit strategy. After decades of watching this adventure, the cornfield chase scene remains a knockout and one you never ever get tired of, particularly Grant's arrival, stepping off a bus in the middle of nowhere. Hitchcock got it just right and that about sums up this whole neat adventure. One for the books and, yes, debatable as to whether it's Hitch's number one or number two, but let the record show that this is what a film classic should be, from beginning to end.",
34,26 March 2005,esteban1747,7, Hitchcock once again,"Cary Grant was certainly an excellent actor, he was able to lead some thrillers without loosing his acting humor, and ""North by Northwest"" is an example. Interesting that the film starts with the presence of the director Hitchcock in its first scene. Then Cary Grant became for unknown reasons a man (spy) called Kaplan, he was kidnapped at the restaurant and brought to a big house where the punishment was to get him drunk with whiskey and then left driving a car in the evening. I have no intention to give the whole story of the plot, but you may guess that after these first scenes the rest was very much complicated and if you leave the screen you risk to loose the coherence of the film and not to understand all tricky reasons given by Hitchcock. Grant had a good partner in then beautiful Eva Marie Saint, and to a lesser extent from experienced James Mason. If you wish to see an interesting film, I advise you to see this one, another Hitchcock's jewel.",

Thornhill (Cary Grant) the object of a cross country spy hunt. Having no clue what is happening to him, Thornhill will be kidnapped by the spies, brought to an unknown mansion and after the questioning forced to get drunk. He will get arrested for a stealing a car and drunk driving of which he has no recollection. It is just the beginning.

38,15 March 2008,hnt_dnl,10, A deliriously entertaining masterwork,"Alfred Hitchcock was a certified genius of a filmmaker. He could scare you, shock you, surprise you, enthrall you, make you think, make you smile, make you laugh, and all the while making you a part and parcel of the storytelling and action in his film. His goal was always to make the audience a part of the action and take them along for the ride. He may do this to absolute perfection in this film, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, my absolute favorite film of his. It's debatable whether or not this is his greatest film. A lot of so-called film 'critics' will swear by VERTIGO(although I'm not crazy about it), some say PSYCHO, others say NOTORIOUS, some prefer SHADOW OF A DOUBT, others REBECCA. Who knows? I just know that NORTHW BY NORTHWEST, without a doubt, is the most thoroughly enjoyable, fun, fascinating, entertaining, and eye-popping film that Hitchcock ever did. I love every frame of it.

The many hokey takes on it through the years have diminished its very real power as a storytelling device. As a comedy trick, it is cheap and dull. But as a dramatic trick... there is real force behind it. Everyone dreads being alone in the time of a crisis and not having anyone believe them and feeling like they are sinking further and further into a pit that's growing ever deeper and deeper. A good filmmaker can use the idea of mistaken identity in a tense situation to tackle these fears. And Hitchcock most certainly is a few steps above a good filmmaker.",

Cary Grant stars (in the last of four collaborations with Hitchcock) as an advertising executive mistaken for a spy and chased cross-country by foreign agents, as well as the police. What follows is one classic scene after another, including the famous scene where Grant is chased by a crop duster. James Mason and Martin Landau make excellent villains. Eva Marie Saint is the sexy double agent who shares some sizzling scenes with Cary. The two had palpable chemistry. Healthy doses of comedy help make this such an enjoyable watch.

While everyone has their favorite parts to the movie, mine are not the most famous. My favorite scene is when Cary Grant drunkenly phones his mother from the police station. It's easily the funniest scene in the film, and I happen to adore Cary when he's in his humorous element. My favorite line in the film has become a frequently used household phrase of my family's: James Mason, in one of his iconic villainous roles, smirks at Cary and asks, ""Games . . . must we?"" in his imitable accent.

Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill, for example, feels a little foreign among today's thriller protagonists (accent aside) as a 50-year-old everyday man thrown into a mess of a government situation. The action is certainly not big- budget like modern films either with the exception of one explosion.

I was really disappointed with this , especially because it was a Alfred Hitchcock film. At times i was confused by the plot and at others i was just bored. Cary Grant's acting seemed wooden and the relationship with Eva Marie Saint was never convincing. The loves scenes were very cold and the 27 year age gap seemed very apparent.

61,12 December 2017,robert-temple-1,10," The greatest Hitchcock film, stunning and perfect","This film is probably where Hitchcock's genius rose to its greatest height. I have seen it several times over the years, and it keeps getting better and better. Now we have a Blu-ray remastered version, so I have seen it again, all crisp and new. A large part of the success of this film is due to Ernest Lehman, who wrote the screenplay. He was one of Hollywood's top screenwriters and his skills were crucial in making this story work. The film is gripping from the first scene to the last, and never loses its tension for a moment. Cary Grant's somewhat weird personality was perfect for the lead role in this tale of mysterious intrigue. The combination of his droll insouciance and dry humour with his expressions of continually surprised astonishment is just the right mix. I can't think of any other actor who could so perfectly have compounded the variegated tinctures of ambiguity into this sublime decoction of suspense. (What do you mean, that last sentence was affected?) As for Eva Marie Saint, never was she so glorious as in this picture. She has just the right mix as well. And those two mixes went well together, and are the very opposite of oil and water. Or to put it another way, everything gells. And then there is James Mason as the unctuous smoothie bad guy. He really knew how to be convincing at that, and the way he puts his hand on Eva Marie Saint's shoulder in the auction room, to say 'you are mine', is done so delicately but so emphatically. He was always the master of understatement, Every gesture, every grimace is perfectly planned and plotted. Hitchcock was passionate about story-boarding all his films, and this one is a living story-board. Not one thing is out of place, the film was perfectly executed according to plan. It ticks better than any Swiss watch in history. Tick, tick, tick, and the wheels go round and things happen relentlessly, all precisely timed. The most famous episode in this film is probably when Cary Grant gets off a bus in the middle of a corn field in absolutely nowhere and a crop-spraying plane comes after him, trying to kill him. Who says such things never happen? I saw it with my own eyes, in a Hitchcock film, so it must be true.",
62,9 June 1999,Himadri,5," Fine set pieces, but little sense of pacing or structure","The opening sequences are superb, but, for me, it all goes wrong after the scene in the UN lobby. Just when Hitch should have been tightening the screw, he inserts a scene where a committee of FBI agents reveal to us that they know our hero (Cary Grant) to be innocent. This robs much of what follows of any real tension. Just when the pace should be hotting up, Hitchcock slows things down with that long sequence on the train, which, surprisingly, lacks any sense of danger. As so often with Hitchcock in the 50s, he seemed more interested in glamour than with anything else. And glamour doesn't mix very easily with menace.",
63,30 September 2014,EdwardCarter,1," Slow, dated and boring","Cary Grant, who lived with Randolph Scott for twelve years from 1932 to 1944, was far too old at 55 to be playing the romantic lead. It's hilarious that he looks the same age as the actress playing his mother - horrendously bad casting. This movie is a slow, overlong, dated and boring and it certainly cannot be compared to any of the Bond movies. In contrast to what some other reviewers here have claimed, Grant was never offered the Bond role, because he was far too old at 58. If this rubbish had been half an hour shorter, filmed on location instead of on fake-looking studio sets, and if it hadn't been so slow then maybe it would be watchable.

The movie's only downfall was that it seemed kind of on the long side, and once or twice I caught myself closing my eyes about 15 minutes from the end, but Grant's ability to keep me interested in this movie surpasses the idea that this was even a Hitchcock film. By the middle I'd completely forgotten, because the style seemed so different from all of Hitchcock's previous films I've seen (Psycho, Rope, Vertigo, et-al), and I was happy with the end result.

70,28 June 2016,Horror-yo,6, Far-fetched action-packed Hitchcock starring Cary Grant,"The main criticism one could have for this film is that in the midst of such action and secretive James Bond like intrigues, the viewer may very well at some point feel like the protagonist is just too naive and his adventures seem a bit too unlikely in that particular succession of events. The point of the film was obviously non-stop action, a genuine sense of entertainment throughout, and for the time very impressive visuals, as the ending scene is an absolute token of; and while the dialog is very good and in parts superb, and there is enough to keep the viewer's attention with the various characters, the stakes, the mystery, the action and very good performances given by Grant, Mason, Saint... the film still feels a bit 'far-fetched', like it really wants to go somewhere and stops at nothing to, even if it may've benefited from strengthening the 'how' to get there. Overall the plot is quite clever, and again it's very well executed and a fun ride, but it's fairly long and perhaps counts on the candor of its protagonist a bit too much, and slightly on the overcomplicated side of the action-crime spectrum.",

There are so many great and iconic scenes in this film – the crop duster chase of course, and also those at the United Nations and Mount Rushmore. Hitchcock is brilliant and puts tension in scenes at each and every opportunity, as opposed to devolving a great script into silly chase scenes which lesser directors may have done. It feels like a more masterful 007 movie, and James Mason and Martin Landau are both outstanding as villains. I'm not wild about Eva Marie Saint and only feel real chemistry between her and Grant in the line ""Shall I climb up and tell you why?"" in response to his wondering why she's so good to him, but the final shot of the train speeding into a tunnel was a nice bit of tongue in cheek symbolism from Hitchcock.

There are exciting chase sequences, huge set-pieces, subterfuge, sinister villains, a romance with a femme fatale, and a dashing star playing an innocent man attempting to clear his name.

Some are straight thrillers, some conjoin with romances, horror, this conjoins with mystery. Hitchcock has combined these two, but has never done a better and more exciting film. Nobody has ever or will ever do a better, more exciting film. Having said that, is this better than, say, Vertigo or Psycho? Arguably. But Vertigo is a romance/thriller, Psycho is a horror/thriller and NBNW is a mystery/thriller. This does surpass other movies of its kind like Rear Window and The Maltese Flacon. The general story is a classic case of mistaken identity where a complex, top-secret government plan is under wraps. The movie grabs you by your collar the in the first two minutes and never lets go as the thrills and curves never stop coming at you full force. The main character (Cary Grant) careens to different ends of America as he must keep up with the game of cat-and-mouse he dies to get out of.

Cary Grant is the suave, debonair hero who finds himself clinging to a man with a knife in his back in the lobby of the United Nations Building. When he goes on the run, determined to find out who framed him, it isn't just the authorities who are after him but the villains as well. When he meets a leggy blonde on a train, (what is it with Hitchcock and trains?), she is not all that she seems.

90,23 December 2010,Steffi_P,6," ""Tease a man to death""","North by Northwest, among the best-known of all Hitchcock pictures, was in fact begun with the specific intention of creating (in the words of its writer Ernest Lehman) ""the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures"". And to this end it does seem to tour faithfully round all the familiar stops on the Hitchcockian trail – the falsely accused man, the espionage backdrop the exact details of which are not elucidated, the showdown on a famous monument, the dry wit and the sharp innuendo. This may make it the most archetypal, but does it make it the best? One thing that really stands out about North by Northwest is that it is one of Hich's more comedy-laced scripts. Or more accurately, the comedy is more tightly interwoven, rather than being kept as a standalone feature for certain scenes or characters. And while there are some good laughs here, such as Cary Grant's nonchalant wisecracking when he is first kidnapped (which really makes us warm to the character), it seems to be at the expense of the action. You see, although there are certainly a lot of speedy chases, narrow escapes and cunning getaways, not a single one of them is up to Hitch's best standard. The drunk-driving chase for example is more awkward than nailbiting. There is simply no material for Hitchcock to do some grand orchestration of suspense, like say the concert hall scene from The Man Who Knew Too Much or the finales of Rear Window and Psycho. All in all this wrong-manhunt seems more like a case of annoyance rather than something to inspire the old ""it-could-happen-to-you"" fear factor.",

The screenplay development isn't really that good, though, considering there's too much talk compared to significant spies work or fugitive hunting or avoiding capture, which what the movie is perceived to be offering. The technical things rather annoy me, like there is a strange and imbalanced lighting all over the movie, and the user of too much backdrop for background video. Yes those are maybe tolerable for those era, but for the later times like such as now, they seem quite stupid.

Even when covered with crop-dust, Grant always appears dapper and dry-as-a-martini; both he and this classy adventure hold up extremely well, with Master of Suspense Hitchcock keenly using the patented ""wrong man"" plot just up to a point. With its amusingly inconsequential title, the screenplay is taut yet clever and droll, and the supporting cast (including James Mason as an icily controlled villain and Martin Landau as a faintly fey henchman) does some fabulous work. Even Eva Marie Saint seems to relax here (she's quite sexy and saucy; her best line--an early one aboard the train about making love on an empty stomach--got dubbed over, which hopefully will be corrected someday). Hitch keeps it all snappy and running smoothly, done with a wink and some sly innuendo. *** from ****",

I'm not complaining that the film is dated (1959 ... nope, no problems with that) or that the film is full of plotholes (only a newspaper film critic will complain about that), but I can't see how the film is interesting. I take it that Cary Grant is playing an unrealistic character, someone who's ordinary but thrown into extraordinary situations, but still doesn't flinch when a crop-duster comes after him or when he's escorted out by strangers with guns. Fine - but where's the charm? Where's the suaveness? Where's the style? I don't feel it. In fact, it came across as VERY fake. I don't see Roger Thornhill - all I see is Cary Grant. I can't understand why the cropduster scene is so memorable - is it because it's the first time there was a movie with a man being chased by a plane in it? I take it that the Mt Rushmore scene is memorable because it's the first time it's been done and no other film has really gone to do it again, but didn't think that was outrageously original (not saying it's not a creative idea, just don't get the hype). Eva Marie Saint is pretty and plays the complicated Eve subtly well. But I don't see Hitchcock's 'master' direction - I can't see what's so unique ... or ... or incredible about it.

Basically, New York advertising executive gets mistaken for secret agent by bad guys and gets chased/framed in various escapades. A lot of the scenes were tense (or 'thrilling' I suppose) and the movie kept me interested throughout. The plane scene and the auction scene were especially great; the mount Rushmore one was a little over-the-top. The big thing that seemed to detract was the main relationship. For one thing, there's a 20-year age difference between the two leads, which looks more like 30 years in the movie. For another, there isn't much of a reason given for their falling in love - they don't have any shared interests or common background. The dialogue between them is sort of clever, but it seems kind of shallow. Towards the end, the plot also starts to get explained in less-subtle/more-ham-fisted ways, with characters telling the main character exactly what the audience needs to hear.

113,1 June 2004,ksf-2,9, one of Hitchcock's experiments in timing,"Just as Hitchcock used the elements of suspense and timing in Psycho, they are at work here again in North by Northwest. Grant, the lead character, is in the middle of some giant spy thriller adventure, running all over the country ( scope the different venues - the UN building, an auction house, farm fields, trains, and the thrilling climax at an American landmark...) In Psycho, what the audience thinks is the lead character is killed off early in the movie... here in N by NW, it's a different kind of timing experiment - the hero of the movie (and the viewer!) are kept in the dark, caught up in the intrigue until three quarters of the way through the movie. When Cary Grant (and the viewer) are filled in on what is really going on, it's an easy transition to complete the rest of the movie, and the plot sort of changes over to a ""will the good guys beat the bad guys ?"" plot, and the viewer has to be able to buy into some of the things that happen... I think this is another of Hitchcock's experiments in timing. As usual, there are the usual inside jokes planted here & there through-out.

118,29 October 2014,Coventry,10, Pure cinematic perfection It's as simple as that!,"I always do something special for anniversaries, and since this is the 3.400th user comment that I write for this wonderful website, I chose to review one of the greatest movies of all-time! Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" is a timeless landmark, an impeccable classic and a pure cinematic monument! Only a handful of movies are totally perfect in every tiniest detail and remain just as astounding by today's standards as when they were first released upon audiences; - more than fifty years ago in this case. Straight from the marvelous and already unforgettable opening credits, designed by the brilliant Saul Bass and provided with mind-blowing music by Bernard Herrmann, you know that this will become a highlight even in the overall magnificent repertoire of Alfred Hitchcock. The genius screenplay, written by the same guy who scripted ""The Sound of Music"" and ""West Side Story"" of all people, is a kind of James Bond story avant-la-lettre. It's a nail-bitingly tense and at times extremely grotesque conspiracy/espionage thriller in which an innocent man's identity is mistaken for that of a government spy who actually doesn't exist. The sly and overconfident advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill is abducted from a hotel lobby and taken to a fancy countryside mansion where he's forced to admit that he is George Kaplan by the foreign spy Philippe Vandamm and his rude team. Thornhill narrowly escapes a carefully planned assassination attempt, but subsequently finds himself framed for murder and pursued by the police as well as by his assailants. He travels to Chicago by train, meets the staggeringly beautiful Eve Kendall and battles for his life all across America, until the final confrontation takes place on top of the Mount Rushmore monument. Now, it's already immensely difficult to bring a genuine edge-of- your-seat suspense thriller, but this film is simultaneously also comical! The humor in the screenplay of ""North by Northwest"" is constant, subtle and dry. The dialogs between Cary Grant and Eve Saint Marie are a terrific example of this, but also the performances of Martin Landau (as the main villain's evil sidekick) and Jessie Royce Landis (as Grant's skeptical mother) are blackly humorous. The action sequences are phenomenal, with the legendary crop dusting airplane chase sequence as the absolute highlight, and the climax is unforgettable. ""North by Northwest"" is just downright perfect; it's as simple as that.",

Roger manages to escape a deathtrap, but is thought to be a reckless drunk driver, and so goes on the run to prove his innocence, and fight the spies. On a train, he meets Eve Kendall(played by Eva Marie Saint) who helps him, but may not be all she seems either.

Basically Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) has ended a normal day of work, and suddenly he is abducted at gunpoint by two henchmen mistaking him for a government agent named George Kaplan. After meeting their boss (unknown for the moment), he is intoxicated and put driving in a car. He manages to escape charges, as long as he can prove his innocence, so he is now following all leads and clues that can lead either back to the abductors, or this ""Kaplan"". Many crimes happen around him, and he is photographed as being the key suspect, but he manages to find a friendly girl, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) on a train, who is instantly attracted to him and says she will help him with his search for answers. At one point Kaplan passes a message to meet Roger on an almost remote road with some crop fields, and this sees one of the most memorable scenes, with him being attacked by the crop dusting plane. After escaping this, he heads to the hotel where he believes Kaplan is staying, and there he finds Eve again, and this is when he starts suspecting she is part of the act. He is right, there is a point that the villains he met before are with her. But he eventually meets The Professor (Leo G. Carroll) who reveals she is working for the government agency trying to find out information about them stealing microfilm secrets, oh, and also that Kaplan is fictional, it's Eve. The conclusion of the film sees Roger going to the house where the villain, Phillip Vandamm (James Mason), and his henchman Leonard (Martin Landau) are staying, near the Mount Rushmore monument, and this sees the second most memorable scene, climbing all over the four presidents (LOL). In the end the villains fall to their deaths, the microfilm is recovered, and Roger and Eve are newlyweds. Also starring Jessie Royce Landis as Clara Thornhill, and Hitchcock's cameo is the man missing a bus. Grant is fantastically charming, the direction is impeccable, and it is just a film you can't miss.

Finding out bits of information while great action instances, saboteur plots, and plot twists lead us by the hand makes the movie feel really fresh as it flows like a smooth river, taking us unexpected turns along the way. The juxtaposition between Mr. Thornhill not understanding what the hell is going on and dealing with the situation like an experienced spy is a joy to watch and experience as Cary Glant's performance is exceptionally good. I praised movie from this era for having wonderful dialogues before and the witty remarks Mr. Thornhill throws out every other scene is no exception - he uses words to great effect and when you add Eve Kendall, played by Eva Marie Saint (who is still kicking and is three years away from turning 100 years old), to the mix, you get the James-Bond like charisma before James Bond and Bond girls even appeared on the big screen.

Cary Grant plays a character who likes brave clever repartee with his captors, though he has none of Bond's lethality, just his confidence.",

For example, Cary Grant is in the middle of a dirt road near some crops when out of nowhere a crop duster appears and tries to fly over him and kill him.

Cary Grant plays an advertising executive abducted and learns that he was mistaken for someone else. He cannot reason with them and when he refuses to cooperate with their demands he is force fed alcohol and sent on a driving spree that ends with his arrest. His story is laughed at and a trip to the mansion with police goes unsuccessful due to the removal of evidence. Fascinating mystery with Grant up for murder with plot turns, train rides, mystery blondes, and a heart-pounding climax atop Mount Rushmore. Skilled directing by Alfred Hitchcock who worked with Grant in three previous films. Grant is hilarious yet intelligent as he struggles to render his innocence as well as avoid police. Eva Marie Saint plays a suspicious blonde with secret ties beneath the romance. James Mason plays the sly villain whose defeat should have been more highlighted. Jesse Royce Landis brings humour as Grant's unbelieving mother but more of her would have been great. Martin Landau plays Mason's sinister head henchmen.

Asking which is the best Hitchcock is something like asking which is the best Beethoven symphony, but if pressed to the wall I would call NBNW Hitchcock's Ninth (and Psycho, his Fifth).
The coolest of Grant and the hottest of Marie Saint is simply
the coolest film ever made from every angle you can think of.
Few people would contend that Cary Grant was not the coolest leading man of Hollywood's golden age but this pic is the peak of his coolness, along with that the coolest James Mason ever as the smoothest polite villain of all time and the slinkiest Eva Marie Saint ever, all adds up to one of the most satisfying pieces of celluloid entertainment ever conceived.
Most Hitchcock movies have one unforgettable white knuckle cliff hanger sequence but NBNW has two -- the chase out in the wheatfields by a poisonous crop duster biplane and the final chase across the faces of the four presidents at Mount Rushmore, which ends up literally ... as a cliffhanger.
Even a third if you include the comical auction scene where Grant keeps making outrageous bids to attract the police and thus escape the clutches of the killers lurking in the room waiting to get him.
So much has been written about this picture that there is no need to recount the plot other to say that it is a towering masterpiece of the romantic suspense drama genre with all players at the top of their game - and don't forget a young menacing Martin Landau as Mason's cold blooded sidekick, another great actor who just passed away on July 15, 2017 at age 89.
NBNW is frequently rerun on TV so it's not hard to catch up with but it never gets old or fails to make you hold your breath even when you know what's coming next. An ultimate classic.",

A brilliant script, full of well-planned twists, Hitchcock's energetic and vivid direction, the constantly clever dialogue, the first-rate production values, an incredible score by Bernard Herrmann (who pretty much ripped-off himself the following year when he wrote the score for ""Psycho"") and several memorable sequences (the often neglected auction scene is extremely amusing) are only some of the ingredients that make this thriller so terrific. I have two minor complaints, though: the film is SLIGHTLY overlong (maybe it could have been 15 minutes shorter) and Eva Marie Saint just isn't a particularly attractive woman, compared to Grace Kelly or even to Tippi Hedren, so she is kind of miscast in the role of a ""femme fatale"". And her performance isn't in the same class with the delightful ones that Grant and Mason give.

One can tell that Hitchcock might be reaching at times to get commercial appeal, even more than usual with his films of the 50s (and after Vertigo and before Psycho, he's trying to make up for what he thought of as lost ground at the box office frankly).

190,26 May 2008,HelloTexas11,10, tremendously entertaining,"I'm something of a latecomer to the films of Alfred Hitchcock. For some inexplicable reason, I had it in my head for years that I wouldn't enjoy most of his work. Even sillier is the fact that the two Hitchcock films I HAD seen, 'Psycho' and 'The Birds,' were two of my favorite movies ever. Go figure. A few years ago, I rented two of his lesser offerings, 'Rope' and 'Marnie,' which seemed to confirm my suspicions. (Loved the giant backdrop of the battleship at the end of 'Marnie,' though.) Then this year, I have watched three bona fide Hitchcock classics- 'Rear Window,' 'Vertigo,' (both commented on elsewhere) and last night, 'North by Northwest.' Need I even point out that I am now a full-fledged Hitchcock devotee and am really looking forward to seeing the rest of his catalogue. As with 'Vertigo' and 'Rear Window,' I had no preconceptions about 'North by Northwest' and it, like those other two, took me very much by surprise. It is an almost perfect blend of thriller and comedy, neither aspect overwhelming the other. In fact, they compliment each other beautifully. A favorite Hitchcockian theme is the misunderstood main character, in this case Cary Grant's Roger O. Thornhill (the 'O' doesn't stand for anything), and there has probably never been a more misunderstood character in the Hitchcock canon, maybe in all of cinema. Through the most casual mistake imaginable, a group of foreign spies come to believe Thornhill is actually George Kaplan, an American secret agent on their tail. Naturally, Thornhill's protestations to them (after they abduct him) that he is not Kaplan only serve to reinforce their conviction that he is hiding his true identity by pretending to adopt another. It would be an understatement to say Thornhill's life is never the same from that point on. James Mason and a very young Martin Landau portray the foreign (Soviet?) spies and they are perfect choices for their roles. Mason's character, Phillip Vandamm, reminds me quite a lot of one he would play over twenty years later, the defense attorney in 'The Verdict.' Both are well-spoken, quietly threatening, and absolutely cold-blooded while appearing very mannered and reasonable. Nobody does this type of role as well as Mason. After a point, it is revealed that in fact, there is no government agent named George Kaplan. He is a purely fictitious character created by US intelligence to provide cover for another, flesh and blood agent working the case. Thornhill accidentally and unintentionally being mistaken for Kaplan provides the US agency both risks and opportunities; in any event, they are not at all inclined to come to Thornhill's aid and clear him as that would endanger the real agent. Yes, it's complicated and I'm even leaving a lot of stuff out! The head of the intelligence unit, 'The Professor,' is wonderfully underplayed by reliable old Leo G. Carroll. Nothing surprises The Professor anymore, everything the agency does makes perfect sense... this is a man who long ago resigned himself to doing whatever is necessary to achieve, well, whatever is necessary. Because there's nothing else you can do, really. Carroll's conversations with Grant are priceless. The final piece in this convoluted puzzle is a strange woman named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who Thornhill meets on a train as he tries to evade both the spies and the police. Eve helps him and for a while her motivation is unclear; it seems as though she may just be a thrill-seeker who likes living dangerously by picking up strange men. There are some wonderfully provocative exchanges between her and Thornhill; I suspect these are about as far as a mainstream Hollywood film could go in 1959 but aside from that, they are beautifully written by Ernest Lehman and just as well-acted by Grant and Saint. There is a real chemistry between them and... what's the old saying? 'Sparks fly?' Cary Grant himself seems like an odd choice to play Thornhill. With his cultured mannerisms and one-of-a-kind manner of speech, he's hardly the Everyman James Stewart specialized in portraying for Hitchcock (Stewart was originally to play the role but was dropped in favor of Grant.) It is an unusual character for Grant, but one thing is for certain- he is much more convincing as a ladies' man than Stewart ever was. And a funny thing about the character of Thornhill is we really don't get to know him well before the identity mix-up, other than he's a fast-talking ad exec who's twice divorced. Everything else that we learn about him, we learn from his reactions and responses to the situation he finds himself in. He's far from being perfect or brilliant, but he is resourceful and seems to surprise even himself in the degree to which he is attracted to and cares for Eve. Lehman and Hitchcock have thrown everything including the kitchen sink into the plot of 'North by Northwest' and somehow it all works magically. No doubt this was a real crowd-pleaser back in 1959 and it managed that without compromising Hitchcock's talent and vision one iota. A wonderful, wonderful film.",

This move, along with a lot of other ""golden oldies"", are given much too high ratings at IMDb. I argue that the reason for this over rating is that people review movies as if it was sports and not art. Let me explain ;) When you review a world cup soccer match from the 50:s you must take into consideration that the game was much slower, the tactics simple, and that the players were not very well trained, compared to today that is. The world cup final between West Germany and Hungary in 1954 was top quality entertainment, performed by world class artists, if you looked at it 1954. If you look at it today the first thing that strikes you is how much everything has improved. Put simply,the world cup winners of 1954 would not win one match in any division two series in Europe today. But still we can look at the cup final from -54 and say, yeah that was a great game, considering it was played 50 years ago. With art, it's another story. You don't consider, or rather, shouldn't consider, age as a factor. You won't hear anyone say - Yeah, Picasso painted some good shiit back in his days, but he could never compete with today's artists. The same goes for Mozart, Beethoven, Leonardo, Michelangelo etc etc. My argument is that the movie art should be treated as any other art form. ",

By iconic I mean the scenes where a plane swoops down to attack Cary Grant like a hawk to a prey and the climatic foot chase at Mount Rushmore. Nowadays, the weak CGI might cause a frown on your face and they would probably feel too familiar, but you must remember they are first done here; this is the genesis. It's because of Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest that so many action scenes are possible. This is where it happened. I knew all that plus the taut suspense, the economically drawn characters, and the music score, but I never counted on such an awesome screenplay. The dialogue is simply amazing. Just the foreplay dialogue between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint is the stuff of so much conversations. It is erotic and playful enough to make me grin like a monkey. It is filled with eroticism, yet subtle, never high-brow, with a cheeky know-it-all tone. The suspense coupled with the comedy and romance is almost a template for movies of this type nowadays, but no one can direct like the master. The film may be 1959 but it feels so on the beat even today. This is masterclass cinema.",

He milks every drop of suspense and along the way injects a lot of humor .A brisk screenplay by Ernest Lehman a Cary Grant that is just pure delight, Eva Marie Saint fresh out of her Oscar from ""On the Waterfront"" is an icy blonde with a brain and providing a good number of delightful moments.

What's more, It could as well be placed in the same box as the James Bond franchise, because it may in some aspects remind of the well-known spy movies (Cary Grant could have been a perfect 007, with his elegance, handsome face and fantastic overall presence). However, I must say that it combines a better-developed structure, more wit in its dialogues and greater suspenseful sequences than any Bond movie does.

Most of the film was filmed at actual locations, not some cheap hollywood set(well okay rushmore was a little fake). I was unsure what would happen next throughout the whole movie. Its probably the only movie I have ever watched, where each prediction I made about what would happen next, was wrong.  The plot twisted many times, yet in the end it all made perfect sense.  The audience didnt have to think about the movie after seeing it to figure it out.  Yea Pyscho was a heart pounder, but this is by far Hitchock's best film.

202,24 June 2020,ryanpillion,8, The perfect adventure (in my opinion),"Going along with the time period, these pictures just keep getting better and better. The stories of the old films are so entertaining for a kid from future generations to watch and see what's changed and what has stayed the same. The cinematography in this movie is undoubtedly the best so far, but I couldn't really find a deeper meaning in it compared to something like 1917. However masing and the editing done in this movie (very obvious now) was done really good for 1959, you can compare a scene in the taxi where the back window is masked to see the streets even though the lighting is completely off the mask itself fits perfectly with the outline of the window to a scene in star wars a revolutionary film for its time.
The story itself is what kept my attention the most. I really felt for what the character was going through and what he did to overcome it seemed like he was trying to get out of a relationship in his home. When he met the girl on the train you could instantly tell she was involved even before she sent the letter to the antagonist. After getting almost killed by the plane and ending up finding her was very funny because he knew she set him up but he went along with it so he could get the most information out of her and eventually finding out that she works with the man who was chasing him. The only thing about the story that I'm opposed to is the ending, it was very abrupt and even though the transition from mount rushmore to the train car was seamless I would've enjoyed an ending where you see the characters get saved by the park rangers and the protagonist to get a reward.
Wrapping up North by Northwest, this picture has been by far one of the greatest movies I've seen especially for its age. I believe that it should get a higher spot on the list other than 95. Even though the ending wasn't ideal, maybe this one can because it is getting a 8/10.",

205,22 September 2021,cmantafounis,8, North by Northwest,"Pure movie magic: Hitchcock at his pulpiest, an exercise in sheer entertainment. Comparisons to James Bond here are not just pertinent in regards to the genre and characters, but all the more so in style - this exists on the same plane as Raiders of the Lost Ark in its elevation from any semblance of reality. On this level, Thornhill being forced to drink a bottle of bourbon and then to drive a stolen vehicle is not out of the ordinary. A plan to kill him involving a deserted road and a crop duster is perfectly logical. His dialogue with Eve Kendall, mostly consisting of explicit innuendo, is completely natural in this heightened world exclusive to films. Led by a charming Cary Grant performance, an ecstatic Bernard Hermann score, and plenty of Alfred Hitchcock's visual flair, North by Northwest is designed solely as a moviegoing experience. At 136 minutes, this lacks the sleekness of his earlier spy capers (e.g. The 39 Steps) but more than makes up for it in craft. Any pacing issues in the second act - and occasional instances of clunky exposition - are paid back tenfold with a dazzling final half-hour. A suffocating masterwork of suspense in Vandamm's house (note the ""fake gun"" reveal used here, successfully, *three* times), an iconic chase scene down Mount Rushmore, and a sudden cut so perfectly suited to the tone that one smiles just thinking of it. And, of course, that marvellous final shot. A climax indeed. This may not be as artful or as flawlessly executed as some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces, but I'll be damned if it isn't his most fun.",

207,19 April 2020,garethcrook,10, Hitch at his best,"The Bernard Herrmann music, the Saul Bass titles and as those names hit the screen, Cary Grant, James Mason, Eva Marie Saint, of course Hitchcock himself, the hairs stand up on the back of my neck, as we begin the next instalment of our Lockdown Hitch Retrospective. I adore the energy of this film. Yes it's packed with classic suspense, but it's also a thrilling ride at quite blistering pace. We start in the hustle and bustle of the city as Ad man Roger Thornhill (Grant), gets caught in a case of mistaken identity as the wanted spy George Caplin, wanted by Phillip Vandamm (Mason), he of most wonderful voice. In fact all the voices here are rather special. Right from the get go we're thrust into the murky world of Cold War espionage. Thornhill gets chased by goons, turns out to be an excellent drunk driver and in his attempts to figure out what's going on, only digs himself deeper, with one suspenseful scene after another.
The scenes, oh boy! That aforementioned cliff side night time car chase, the murder at the United Nations building. Literal back stabbing and all before we get to the Prairie stop. The crop duster scene is a stone cold classic, a beautiful contrast of starkness against the otherwise majestic backdrops. Like the cafe at Mount Rushmore, Vandamm's gorgeous home and Rushmore itself. I suppose the chase scene finale over Mount Rushmore is considered the centrepiece, but truthfully any number of locations here would be fitting of such praise. That they're all packed into one film and so cohesively is astonishing. It does feel like it relies a lot on the stunning locations, but the plot really is fantastic. Add to that some classic 50s dialogue and genuine stars delivering it, it's clear to see why this works so well. You forget how funny and charming it is too, Grant delivers some wonderful lines and his chemistry with Saint is pure Hollywood romance. Martin Landau as the sinister and rather bird-like Leonard, personifies the dangerous world this slick production inhabits and in any other film would steal the show. I can't find a single flaw and nor would I want to. North By Northwest makes you want to love it... and I do.",
208,29 November 2013,callanvass,10, One of Hitchcock's many masterpieces,"The word masterpiece seems like a broken record when it comes to Hitchcock movies. The man is responsible for so many classic movies. Not only is Hitchcock the master of suspense, but he's also king of adventure. It's a masterfully crafted adventure that never has a boring moment. It's over two hours long, and the time flies by. I give Hitchcock a lot of credit for delivering expert pacing throughout the movie. There are a lot of things I could list that make Hitchcock distinguishable from the rest. It's the incredible shot from a high building, the amazing cinematography, and It's the little things that he does, such as using matches to help the heroine during a key moment of suspense; the way he slowly masters the cropduster scene. Everything is ordinary at first, but the audience can't help but conjecture that something dangerous is about to commence. The plane trying heavily to run down Cary Grant is still one of the most suspenseful scenes in the history of cinema. And, of course. How could I forget the finale at Mount Rushmore. Hitchock had major tabs on his audience. The puppets are the audience, and Hitchock is the puppeteer. Not only does it feature witty dialog throughout, but it has some great humor thrown in at times as well. My favorites are the auction scene with Grant, and when Grant gets arrested for being intoxicated from alcohol at a police station. I won't spoil them, but I never fail to laugh whenever I see those scenes. Cary Grant plays a wonderful everyday man. He is exuberant, charismatic, with charm to spare. He is the perfect hero. Very confident, suave, but not overly cocky, and that makes all the difference. As much as I love James Stewart, I'm glad Hitchcock stuck with Grant. Eva Marie Saint gives a scintillating show. Her character has twists and turns, and for a viewer who hasn't seen this movie a few times like I have will be in for a treat with her performance. Hitchcock was reportedly fixated on Blondes. At least he always picked talented and elegant ones. James Mason makes for a tremendous bad guy. His subtly sinister performance was a lot of fun, but it's Martin Landau's eerie show as Mason's henchman that makes the biggest impression, at least in my opinion. Jessie Royce Landis is hilarious as the selfish mother of Grant's. ",
209,20 February 2008,writers_reign,8, Getting There,"This has to be one of the better Hitchcock movies despite inconsistencies. I find Hitchcock vastly overrated which is not the same as incompetent; basically he's a first-rate journeyman with a first-rate press agent but here he wisely cast Cary Grant in the lead and supplied him with a worthy villain in the talented shape of James Mason. Given that pairing you could practically cast Marjorie Main as the love interest and get away with it. For an average man in the street Grant is urbanity personified in the face of real, life-threatening danger and witty with it. It defies credence that someone who'd just been force fed an entire fifth of Bourbon would be able to sit up straight in a car let alone negotiate a winding road in the face of oncoming traffic and if you swallow this then nothing that follows will faze you. Enjoyable, Yes; Credible, No, but what the hey, it's only a movie, Ingrid.",

This music track when played LOUD when you are by yourself at home allows you to 'do a Risky Business' and whilst wearing your underpants like Tom Cruise, throw yourself about the lounge room conducting the orchestra.

212,4 May 2014,moviemattb,10, A Suspenseful Spy Thriller by The Master of Suspense,"""North by Northwest"" is definitely one of my favorite movies by Alfred Hitchcock. He is a pretty darn good filmmaker who knows how to tell a story and where to point the camera at. The movie is about Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive, who has been kidnapped by Phillip Vandamm and his men by a mistaken identity George Kaplan who doesn't exist. So Thornhill has been wrongfully accused as a fugitive and pursed himself across the country. I thought the cast in this movie did wonderful. Cary Grant does a remarkable job for his performance for being funny, confused, and being likable. Eva Marie Saint was lovely in this movie and she was fascinating. James Mason and a young Martin Landau were terrific for playing their roles as the villains. Bernard Herrmann's score was outstanding for creating music for suspense, romance, and excitement. The cinematography in this movie is beautifully shot, and the cornfield scene where Thornhill is being attacked by an airplane is well done.

The film perfectly matches screwball comedy, raunchy romance (without ever getting too sexy), action, and mysterious suspense. A trick in recent films is to confuse the audience until the very end, where needless exposition happens. Hitchcock was a master of mysteries because he knew how many unanswered questions to have on the go at any one time, and when to answer them. As the film progresses, new plot twists arrive, making it an interesting and intriguing film. At the beginning, we are as clueless as Grant, but as the film goes on, we see more and more , gradually making us more informed than Grant. This clever respect for the audience means we are never talked down to. The action scenes are as fantastic today as they ever were.

James Mason is great and also Martin Landau in his first role.  Quite daring for 1959 in its implied sexuality - though I understand that one of Eve's lines on the train was dubbed over as being too risque - she apparently says ""I never make love on an empty stomach"" and that is dubbed to ""I don't discuss making love...."" one for the trivia books.

224,2 September 2000,Hitch-26,10, Greatest Hitchcock Movie EVER!!,"I'll never forget the first time I saw this movie.  This movie has everything.  It has action, drama, comedy, lively music(thank you Bernard Herrmann), great costumes(thank you Edith Head), and of course outstanding performances not only by Hitch in directing, but in acting with Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Jessie Royce Landis, Leo G. Carroll(He was in every Hitch movie it seemed), and Martin Landau(in his first film role--he was brilliant as Leonard).  I love the way Cary Grant says things in such a deadpan way like when he says early in the movie, ""Don't tell me where we going, surprise me!""  Although long, you will not be bored for a single second.  It is really hard for me to believe that Ben-Hur was that great. This movie should have won several oscars.  The end is very memorable as well although I won't give it away.  This movie had several memorable scenes although without question Cary Grant running from the plane is probably the most famous and one of the most famous in all of movies.  One curious note is that Jessie Royce Landis, who also appeared with Grant in To Catch a Thief, plays Grant's mother although Grant is 10 months older than her! Also, make sure you pay attention to the kid in the cafeteria who sticks his fingers in his ears a tad too early!  It is a shame that when people mention Hitchcock's name, they think of the horror stuff like Psycho or The Birds or they think of the taut thrillers like Vertigo or Rear Window.  Not that there is anything wrong with these movies, it is just that nobody thinks he can direct such a non-stop action picture like this.  It may have been the most atypical Hitch movie ever in terms of style, but I feel it is his greatest ever.  If you have never seen this movie, you got to go see it now--you'll be glad that you did.

226,10 August 2015,brchthethird,9, A thrilling action/adventure whose reach somewhat exceeds its grasp,"While not quite Hitchcock's best, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is nevertheless one of his most thrilling, and funny, motion pictures. It stars Cary Grant as an ad executive who gets mistaken for a government agent and has to go on the run in order to survive. Sound familiar? That's because the plot is kind of similar to Hitchcock's own SABOTEUR and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (although you can be certain that Cary Grant's character didn't; the bad guys just think he does). This simple premise provided for a myriad of exciting set-pieces that exemplify the kind of suspense-building and thrills that Hitch's audience were most certainly used to by this point in his career. Cary Grant is quite a good replacement for the everyman character that James Stewart played so well, and Eva Marie Saint plays a nice twist on the femme fatale as this film's Hitchcock blonde. Still, what struck me so much was how funny this film was. At certain points, it was like watching a comedy of errors combined with a spy thriller. There was also a lot more obvious sexual innuendo than in any Hitchcock picture I've seen before. Signs of the changing times, maybe? Moving on, even though it wasn't as tightly written as some of Hitchcock's other films, being essentially a bunch of action set-pieces strung together, it was still rather inventive and the momentum was kept going at a pretty good pace throughout. In particular, the crop-dusting scene and the climactic sequence on Mount Rushmore stand out from the rest, as I'm sure they do to many others who've seen the film. However, what made this not quite as perfect as could have been has a lot do with Hitchcock's tendency to do a lot of shooting on sound stages. As a result, a car chase that takes place early on (with a drunk Cary Grant) was less thrilling and believable than it could have been, and Bernard Herrmann's score had to compensate (a little too much, perhaps). And, the villains this time around weren't as memorable, mostly because we don't really see them do anything villainous. Still, James Mason was a pleasure to watch, and we get to see Martin Landau play a heavy. Overall, I do think this is better than the previous Hitchcock films I mentioned, if for no other reason than that there's more of what worked in those films. Still, at 136 minutes, it is a little too long and, like many other of Hitchcock's movies I've seen, the ending was too abrupt and a little bit of a cheat. So, while its reach does somewhat exceed its grasp in terms of the action, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is still a suitably thrilling action/adventure that ranks among the most entertaining that Hitchcock ever made.",

His life changes for the worse when he is accidentally mistaken for an American spy and is subsequently kidnapped by Soviet bloc agents wanting certain top-secret information. Unable to provide them with the information they demand, the order is given to have him killed. This leads to a series of attempts upon his life which dramatically increase in frequency after he meets an attractive blonde named ""Eve Kendall"" (Eva Marie Saint) who offers to help him out of his predicament. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is probably one of Alfred Hitchcock's better films which includes a good blend of suspense, action and humor along with one specific scene involving a crop duster that has gained worldwide fame. It also has some good performances by the aforementioned Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint as well.

230,7 February 2020,Coffee_in_the_Clink,9, Cary Grant steals the show,"""North by Northwest"" is one of Hitchcock's best movies. A funny, adventure-filled thriller about an advertisement executive, played by Cary Grant, who is mistaken for a government agent by some powerful unscrupulous characters and kidnapped. Eventually framed for murder then, he goes on the run, with the police, FBI and the criminals whom he has invariably crossed all hot on his tail. Cary Grant is fantastic. He delivers so many witty and sarcastic lines throughout the film, one of my favourites being ""I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex-wives and several bartenders that depend upon me, and I don't intend to disappoint them all by getting myself slightly killed."" He was in good shape in this for a man over fifty. Hitchcock's direction is evident and as powerful as it ever was; the Mount Rushmore scenes are highly applaudable and were a fitting backdrop for a story that took us to many places and mad scenarios. Ernest Lehman is the one we have to thank for the story and script. Grant, Hitchcock and Lehman's work together help ensure that ""North by Northwest"" maintains a perfect balance between serious, high-octane thriller and comedy.",

This classy duo and their coming together seemed to be a Bond film in the making. And despite the espionage element, it was the humor and double entendre dialog that carried the action.

The post-war modernity, the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, the slick decor, the stylish fashion, all marred by the contextual Cold War paranoia. The leading man is thrust out of the masses into a plot of spiralling complexity and mystery, but of course he is no spy, but another everyman just trying to get by (and early on we have that overhead shot of the UN escape making him tiny like an ant). The film resolves to get more out of him; to fill that big, empty 'O' in the middle of his name and in short, be a man his mother would be proud of. ",

Its plot is a classic case of mistaken identity, an every-man on the run with a bit of a twist. 'North By Northwest (1959)' is witty, exciting and intriguing, soaked in a layer of suave charm helped immensely by Grant's cool-as-a-cucumber performance.

241,22 February 2014,mike48128,9," Cary Grant and Eve Marie Saint ""own"" this movie","A playful if not implausible story of mistaken identity, espionage, and romance. One of Alfred Hitchcock's best films and far easier to watch than ""Psycho"" or the nightmarish ""The Birds"". Both actors are in great shape for their roles, although Eva hardly looks as young as the 26-year-old temptress she portrays. The violence is quite restrained here and it's more of a chase movie than a bloody thriller. The plot is celebrated: a suave and sophisticated advertising man is mistaken for the fictional spy ""George Kaplan"" by a smuggling ring headed up by Philip Van Damm (James Mason). Whether Kaplan is supposed to be FBI or CIA is never quite explained by ""The Professor"" played by Leo G. Caroll in one of his best movie roles ever. (His worst: The mad scientist in ""Tarantula""). Cary Grant's character almost dies by several playful methods: driving a runaway sports car off a cliff after Bourbon is poured down his throat, shot at by a machine gun from a crop dusting airplane, and falling off the side of Mount Rushmore. Eva's character as a ""kept woman"" and secret agent is not quite plausible but she is so ""hot"" it doesn't really matter. The Bernard Hermann musical score is outstanding. The Chinese idol concealing the microfilm is a thinly-disguised plot-devise borrowed from ""The Maltese Falcon"" and certainly not an original idea. Also, when Jame Mason falls to his death on Mount Rushmore, it looks matted in. The title refers to both Northwest Airlines and the direction the chase takes from Chicago to South Dakota. The somewhat predictable ending on the ""20th Century Limited"" is humorously punctuated by the train going into a dark tunnel, as Cary and Eve finally get together, for perhaps the 2nd time, in the finale. Most enjoyable to watch and beautifully photographed. Both the forest and Mt. Rushmore are, at times, movie sets! One of my favorite movies and the only one that Hitchcock made for MGM.",

Because all of the awesome ideas have been taken pretty much, and when I saw this film, it put me back into the appreciation of the real good movies of the past. Alfred Hitchcock is without a doubt one of the greatest directors of the 20th century. I hope his work will never die within the years because of all these remakes, I'm afraid that when I have a family one day and if my kids have a love for films as I do, they won't get to witness how great movies were made. The acting, yes, it's clique, but it works so well. It has a ""Casablanca"" type of feel for the romance. The action had some wit and humor to it.

Okay mistaken identity thriller by Alfred Hitchcock. I expected more from this much-heralded money maker from the great director. I felt like he almost relied too much on the like-ability of the star Cary Grant to try and pull this one off instead of his film-making. The movie was interesting early with Grant given a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor, as an advertising agent who is mistaken for someone else, and kidnapped. The early twists kept my interest, but when the focus became the possible romance between him and the Eva Marie Saint character - a little around half way thru - it became dull. I do admit that they have one of the hottest pre-code exchanges I have seen on film, and the interesting use of the United Nations and Mount Rushmore is definitely different, but this doesn't make a whole movie. What makes a thriller are twists and turns not romantic interests. It's ok to have this as long as it doesn't simplify the story - ultimately this movie does this. Do we really care whether the stars get together in the end ? Not I - I know it's going to happen - what matters is what happens between. James Mason is the ""so-called"" mean guy in the story, but in my opinion - he is a little too refined in the part. I'm glad I saw the movie, but nothing really made me want to see it again.",

However, contrary to the stereotype of the artist resisting the trappings of celebrity, this star image was one Hitchcock voluntarily, even consciously bought into, playing up his larger than life image of the 'master of suspense', particularly in his show, ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", complete with his own recognizable theme song. As such, it would appear that the collection of tropes, whether thematic trends, technical similarities or recurring narrative and character types now characterized as a ""Hitchcock film"" were hardly accidental, a theory for which North by Northwest proves a perfect example. Largely recognized as one of Hitchcock's most fun and least serious outings, North by Northwest can be retrospectively seen as an attempt by Hitchcock to make, in many ways, the definitive ""Alfred Hitchcock"" film, intentionally encapsulating and often playing up many of the defining elements of his past films into a single, hugely enjoyable narrative.

North by Northwest looks like a tinker toy or a daydream after The Wrong Man and Vertigo. Hitchcock and Lehman are not especially serious about their whodunit and allow the spirit of Hitchcock's Gaumont halcyon days to breathe with new VistaVision life. With a whimsical bearing and an offhand drollness, they're spinning their welcomingly familiar wheels right from the start as they unravel a cheerfully unlikely plot. Their literal and figurative pinnacle is carried a little too far and there's the occasional hazier patch, but they do pilot us on a most picturesque, absorbing and joyous chase. Hitchcock's glossy, ironic, mistrustful thriller encapsulated the spirit of the time entirely: Cold War dubiousness, refined modernization, the entomological commotion of city life and a suggestion of alarm behind the silky suits of prosperity.",

It was Psycho for many years, but sometime in the mid- 1990s, it became Vertigo (coincidentally a time when a new restored print of that came out). Apart from the beautiful new print (which I also saw on the big screen), I was probably somewhat also swayed by the Sight & Sound critics poll where Vertigo had just displaced Citizen Kane as the greatest movie of all times.

Cary Grant may have been a few years too old for this leading role, but the fast-paced, ever-intensifying script that envelopes him never gives us the chance to sit and stew on it. The concept that powers the whole bag is astonishingly simple, and once it's knocked out of the way in the first act, the picture is then perfectly happy to gradually up the stakes and riff on the premise for the rest of its allotted time. It's a testament to the creativity of the filmmakers that it still feels so fresh and untainted today, in the era of the derivative knock-off, with only a few dated automobiles and touches of public etiquette reminding us it's actually closing in on sixty years of age.

Now, that doesn't mean the rest of it is lacking, as it should be common knowledge of its solidified place in the canon of the greatest American films in the history of the cinema, but the zenith is found in a classic Hitchcock concept: the image of the pursuer and the pursued. Its famous sequence of a crop-duster aircraft leaping towards Cary Grant's Roger O. Thornhill in the Midwest countryside - bullets flying near his dives for survival - is constructed through the context of a world unknown: a place not designed for your color or creed or gender or social status. It is an environment, depicted via the absurd logic of a home becoming a prison, which is entirely turned against you. It is what many people feel like when they wake up in the morning. Thornhill's anxiety of normal, simple structures and people, such as the bus and the man waiting for it, defines a clash between uncomfortable normalcy of culture and those who oppose the system because they don't know how else to live. In Hitchcock's universe, an airplane with assassins at the controls is an obvious occurrence, but for Thornhill, it is a symbol of confinement and hostile order taking hold of even the most inhuman machine and making it ruthless. What else to do but run?",

He certainly gave us one. 'North by Northwest (1959)' might just be the most outright entertaining of the director's pictures, a film that exists solely to give its audience a rollicking good time. Throughout his career, Hitchcock often utilised his established stars – for example, Cary Grant in 'Suspicion (1941)' or James Stewart in 'Vertigo (1958)' – as an opportunity to deconstruct their ingrained public image. Here, instead, he simply goes with the flow. In his fourth and final film for the Master of Suspense, Cary Grant plays with a familiar persona – debonair and charming, cocky and mischievous. His Roger O. Thornhill (the arbitrary middle initial an overt jab at producer David O. Selznick) is an advertising executive, superficial and self-serving, but with the charisma to support these dastardly qualities. Such a man is surely in need of a comeuppance, and Hitchcock delights in every plot twist that sees Thornhill plunged ever further into a sadistic practical joke cooked up by the Cold War.",

Cary Grant stars as a Madison Avenue executive who becomes a pawn by a spy organization,set up as a murder suspect,and skirts the country,hoping to find the answers to just why he's being set up. Toss in the requisite Hitchcock blonde beauty (Eva Marie Saint),and lots of plot twists, and you got yourself the formula for a white knuckled thriller. The film has some scenes that have become legendary,if not outright iconic (Grant being pursued by a crop duster airplane,the suspenseful scenes at Mount Rushmore,etc.). Hats off to musical director/composer, Bernard Hermann for crafting a music score that compliments the film nicely (as does his other musical scores for not just Hitchcock,but other films he wrote & arranged music for). The film is also a treat for the eye,filmed in the original Technicolor process & shot in the sadly now defunct 'Vistavision' process (another special wide screen process that Paramont seemed to have the copyright for,but allowed M-G-M to implement for this one film,only).

Costumer Kress captures 1959's fashion flair, while leads Saint, and a Grant who, per the pressed plot, can't escape his gray suit, are at their physical peaks which does nothing to make the Mt Rushmore scene anything more than a campy Saboteur re-do (SoL).

Nasty James Mason and his fey accomplice Martin Landau chase Grant throughout the US leading up to a now famous climax atop Mt. Rushmore. Eva Marie Saint is the REAL govt. agent also caught up in the mix. It's directed at break neck speed with Hitchcock having A LOT of fun (note that final shot!).

The plot keeps getting stranger and stranger and all about two spies who don't seem to walk around with bodyguards or are armed themselves. Too many coincidences, and not enough intrigue. Sorry.
IN ADDITION, there is a point where Grant goes through Eva Marie's personal stuff and musingly finds her very small shaving brush and very small shaver. He later uses them in the bathroom of the Rail Road station and it seems to take him an extra amount of time to shave.

311,8 December 2019,andrewmerritt-31652,10, One crazy roller coaster,"North by Northwest stars Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, and James Mason and is directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The film revolves around an advertising executive named Roger Thornhill who is mistaken for another man named George Kaplan who is forced to go on the run from the government as well as a secret organization who is out looking to kill him. There are two ways of looking at this film. One is just looking at this picture as your standard plot with your typical protagonist and antagonist. But the second way is looking at this in a psychological way. Meaning did all of this actually happen or did he create this fantasy just to escape his boring mundane life? Or another way you can look at this is Roger Thornhill and George Kaplan the same person? And this movie isn't built or structured like a psychological thriller like some of Hitchcock's other movies. But this is Alfred Hitchcock were talking about here. And no other director can take this concept and turn it into a psychological film. Only he can turn a simple concept into something that will make you question your own sanity and have you dissect each frame and shot of the film. That's why this movie is so brilliant as we journey down the rabbit hole inside of Roger Thornhill's warped and twisted mind as he tries to solve the mystery that makes us never leave. I never found myself bored or irritated because I didn't want the journey to end as Alfred Hitchcock hypnotizes the viewer into joining him on this crazy adventure. And the adventure never stops as we have different genres like action, adventure, romance, and comedy all wrapped up in a nice bow. And all these different genres fit so perfectly together that you can sit back and relax without ever scathing your head in confusion. In the end this is one of those movies that will stand the test of time that it has become the inspiration for movies that borrow the same plot, but they will never live up to this. What makes this North by Northwest so brilliant to watch is that you forget your watching a two and a half hour and that the studio and everyone on board put in their sweat and tears to deliver an entertaining movie. And it's no surprise that this film is listed in AFI's top 10 mystery films of all time. So overall, this is by far one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies that is definitely worth watching if you haven't seen it.",

330,16 August 2001,Quicksand,10," I'm Not a Hitchcock Fan, but this I like","After years of recommendation, I finally watched NXNW.  Over the years I have seen four other Hitchcock films-- ""Psycho"" (it felt 30 minutes too long), ""Rear Window"" (it felt at LEAST 30 minutes too long), ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (loved it), and ""Vertigo"" (2 hours, felt like it was six).  After a track record like that, I began to think that either a) Years of watching films from the 1980's and -90's has ruined me, or b) Hitchcock isn't nearly as brilliant as some people seem to think he is.  Turns out-- big surprise-- it's a mixture of both.",

Even then, I was surprised at how much I loved this movie. It has to be one of the most well written movies I've seen, it blows modern movie writing out of the water. It's an interesting and fast paced plot that has plenty of turns, but is never anywhere near convoluted or distracting. It's got pretty much everything you could want from an action movie, and then some. Cary Grant is entertaining as ever, and fills his role perfectly.

Roger managed to survive attempts on his life and now goes through extremely hard times maintaining pace with guys that want to kill him. On his journey he encounters women that is mysterious but has some unspoken intentions and every scene with Eve and Roger was quite charming. Now they have fallen in love but she's a secret agent that is spying on Vandamm but Roger is persistent in getting to Eve. Thereafter Roger now went through all kind of events and faking but everything that he was doing payed of when he found himself in situation where he was saving Eve. Roger and Eve are now driving again in train and movie ends in place where they met each other. It was very powerful and tricky picture with some serious and incredible action scene but also deeply romantic and quite pretty. Cary Grant who played Roger was great with his charm and determination in finding truth but also very emotional performance. Eva Marie Saint was Eve and she was extremely loving character with so much emotions and passion. James Mason as Vandamm was very calm but gave dangerous and dark view on his character. 3.5/4,

It was a real treat and I quickly caught myself enjoying every second of the movie and caring for the characters. Character of fatal blonde was done so many times to this day, but it's magnificent what Hitchcock does with it and how he really makes you care for the emotions of the characters. Nowadays, there are some things which stick out, but it can be forgiven given the time the movie was made. Overall, this movie is praised by a lot of people, but others give it less than 10/10 because the movie isn't as deep and thought provoking as other Hitchcock's movies. Well, I disagree there. It's a fun and enjoyable movie and even after more than 60 years it manages to keep you on the edge of your seat.

343,23 March 2012,barryrd,9, One of Hitch's Best,"Coming in the midst of Hitchcock's most productive and highly rated period as a director, this movie is definitely one of his best. To me, it is one of the most entertaining films I've ever watched. It is a double identity thriller involving a New York ad executive, played by Cary Grant, whose routine suddenly falls apart when he is suddenly thrust into the role of a decoy in an international game of espionage. His female counterpart is a secret agent played by Eva Marie Saint, who meets up with him on a train to Chicago. The movie is stylish, with a well written dialogue, stunning photography, humour and suspense. It has the picture postcard look of the 1950's in a series of settings that take the viewer from New York's United Nations and Grand Central Terminal to the Mid-Western cornfields and finally to Mount Rushmore in North Dakota. Leo G. Carroll is the mastermind of the espionage game that pits him against James Mason on the other side, although the two never meet. Mason's henchmen are led by Martin Landau, the star of Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemenors 30+years later. The one flaw that I saw was that Grant was far older than the character he played; however, Grant's stellar performance and iconic presence is memorable. Always a joy to watch, viewers are treated to the witty dialogue and funny scenes that keep coming throughout the movie, not to mention the scintillating repartee among the main characters.",

Eva Marie Saint (who hosts a very interesting documentary of the film on the DVD) is elegant and graceful in the tradition of Grace Kelly which Hitchcock loves so much. James Mason as Van Damme and Martin Landau as Leonard wonderfully underscore their villainy thereby make its implication more threatening than the actual execution (no pun intended). Van Damme and Leonard also appear to have a homosexual undertone in their relationship. There are so many memorable moments in this film. My favorite is the encounter between Roger and Eve on the train. Superb film. Highly recommended, 9/10.",
353,17 June 2014,ofpsmith,10, A precursor to the modern day action films.,"Alfred Hitchcock really shows his expertise in suspense with this thriller. But also his expertise in action too. Here's the plot. Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is an advertising executive but is thought to be a government agent under the name George Kaplan. They force him to drink an entire bottle of alcohol and they put him an a moving Mercedes Benz so he is arrested for drunk driving. He goes back to New York but after pulling a knife out of a man that an assassin threw, the police think he is a terrorist. Roger goes on a quest with CIA agent Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) and finds out that the FBI planted Kaplan as a decoy. But now that he's assumed the role, he's actually enlisted to become Kaplan. He ends up talking with the lead criminal Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) at an auction who has assassins all around. Roger makes a scene so no one can attack him without being seen, and then punches a man so the police take him away. He eventually meets up with Vandamm and Eve again. Eve shoots Roger in the Mount Rushmore café to get away from him. She goes to Vandamm's country home but Roger saves her from being killed. At the end there's a spectacular chase scene on Mount Rushmore. It's one of the most famous movie scenes ever like the crop duster chase that happens earlier, in the film. I say go check this one out. But in my opinion it's not as good as Rear Window (1954).",
354,16 June 2005,silverscreen888,8," Epic Noir Thriller, Famous For Action Scenes and Smart Dialogue","""North By Northwest"", Alfred Hitchcock's mature masterwork of camera-work, is even better liked by the director's admirers than it is admired by film critics. It is long, expansive, filled with scenic and interesting changes of locales, and it is I suggest always an exciting cinema noir color adventure. The story was Hitchcock's, written as a film at his request by Ernest Lehman, and then extensively rewritten before production; at every point, I can attest, Hitchcock was increasing the realism of the treatment. The story, apart from its 'epic' feel and large number of characters, is another case of the""Rear Window"", ""Man Who Knew Too Much"" genre that Hitchcock mined so extensively but did not discover. The ""ordinary"" man drawn into a web of adventure, intrigue and danger in this case is Roger O.Thornhill, Madison Avenue advertising executive. Mistaken for a government spy, he is kidnapped and taken to meet a mysterious master criminal. What follows is a succession of scenes logically developing from this premise, and one more--the fact that the spy for whom he was mistaken never existed...The scenes for which this film is famous for comprise more than almost any other suspense film can boast--the Long Island estate series, the United Nations series, the Chicago train station series, the 20th Century Limited series, the Four Corners highway series, the hotel series, the auction gallery series, the Rapid City series and the safe house series. The acting is also above average, especially Eva Marie Sant as Eve Kendall and James Mason as Philip Van Damm. Others in the cast include Martin Landau, Leo G. Carroll, Jessie Royce Landis and Josephine Hutchinson. But the understated achievement of this masterpiece of music (Bernard Herrmann), art direction, lighting, sound, costumes and settings is the dialogue. Hitchcock often used dialogue whose purpose was aimed at something other than the main purpose of the ongoing scene. The great scene where Van Damm tries to get Thornhill to confess what he doesn't know, the dinner scene between Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant as Thornhill on a train escaping west, the hotel and auction house scenes and those involving the Leo G. Carroll as the devious Professor make possible much of the film's unusual power. Then there is the sheer physicality of the production's legendary action sequences--the car pursuit of an inebriated Grant, the crop-duster plane strafing sequence, and the final two scenes of Grant invading the enemy's house and then Grant and Saint escaping down the Mt. Rushmore monument have never been bettered. As Thornhill, Grant is more-than-adequate, since the director turned the story toward touches of comedy to relieve the tension he was building, though not ideal. The dozens of others in the large cast seldom have more than a few lines, save for Les Tremayne, Olin Soule, Patrick McVey and Ken Lynch in the auction scene and its aftermath. There are small errors in pacing several during the two sequences in the house used by Van Damm and elsewhere; and the line of development followed, though highly imaginative, was not always the strongest possible. But the artistry of this film is so well-realized that every scene, even the slightly imperfect, come near to being perfectly achieved, reinforcing their memorability. The love story involved incidentally is among the most interesting this side of ""Rear Window"". It is to be regretted that Hitchcock never again attempted a film as important, long or impressively mounted as this one, although ""Topaze"" comes the closest. I confess to watching even half this film every time that I can; from the opening allegory of city life--in the form of levels of human traffic involvement--to the final allegory of sex in a train entering a tunnel, I find this film to be masterfully presented and vastly entertaining on many levels.",

367,3 November 2021,TheHonestCritic,10, Is this the best Alfred Hitchcock film? Check out my review below to find out!,"""North by Northwest"" (1959), this was kind of a big surprise for me. For those who haven't been keeping track, I've reviewed over 200 movies so far, and I've never did one for an Alfred Hitchcock movie! I figured for my first Alfred Hitchcock film review, what better one to start off with than the first one of his movies I've seen? I first saw ""North by Northwest"" on TV when I was 7 or 8, I believe. When I first saw it, I was completely blown away! I haven't watched it that many times after that. But, I figured that I'd see it again before I wrote this review, so it would be fresh in my mind. Sure enough, it holds up brilliantly and I think it's even better than when I saw it for the first time! ""North by Northwest"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is, a New York City ad executive goes on the run after being mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies, and falls for a woman with questionable loyalties. The best way to define this story, is that it's simple, yet complex. For storylines such as this, that format is perfect. Being that this is a spy thriller, complexities on top of a simple plot is warranted, as it keeps the audience guessing and waiting in anticipation for what's going to happen next. ""North by Northwest"" has non-stop thrills and suspense in every scene. My personal favorite scene in this film is when Roger Thornhill, played by Cary Grant, is chased by the crop duster through the cornfields. Every time I see that part, it puts me on the edge of my seat. That's the mark of a great scene, if it thrills you the exact same way every time you watch it! I won't go into anymore details about the plot. But, I guarantee you that you'll be intrigued and invested all the way through from beginning to end. It may be over two hours long, but it goes by in a flash! As for the acting, it's just as fantastic as the storyline. Every single member of the cast nails their respectable characters, and then some! But, the shining star here has got to be Cary Grant as the main character, Roger Thornhill. His performance just adds to the excitement and you want to see him succeed in the end. The whole cast is phenomenal, and their on-screen chemistry is impeccable! All of the sets/locations are beautiful, and give the film a stunning atmosphere. The coolest thing is how much of it is shot on-location. It just makes the movie that much more memorable and a lot of fun to look at. I love when films shoot on-location, rather than in a studio and ""North by Northwest"" does an incredible job with that. There are a few scenes that are filmed in a studio. But, the balance between studio and location is executed so seamlessly, that it brings cohesive results. As far as the special effects go, they are very well-done, especially for it's time! They still hold up to this day. There are some here and there that do look a little aged, but at the end of the day, I still give them a pass. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Bernard Herrmann is exceptional and his film score sets the perfect tone for the story. ""North by Northwest"" is a top-notch spy thriller that fires on all cylinders. Alfred Hitchcock has made several great movies in his career! But, ""North by Northwest"" has got to by my all-time favorite one of his films. In my opinion, it's his magnum opus. It's one of those movies I can watch over and over and never get tired of it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you're looking to get into Alfred Hitchcock films and don't know where to begin, start with this one, especially if you're a big fan of spy movies! I promise you that you'll be hooked and will want to check out more of his films. If you don't go see this movie, then you better watch out for the crop duster!",

The affair between the two main characters is tiring throughout the film, the bad guys could have solved their issues at least 10 times in the movie, the sarcastic Cary Grant makes the thriller to feel like a comedy, and a lot of the action scenes are unrealistic. I don't know how so many people think that this movie is a 9 or a 10,but it did not work for me. I made it until the end, where a plot twist would be expected but boredom was present even there. That's all folks, don't hate me, I just don't think this is what mystery/thrillers should be at their best.",
374,25 June 2000,jhaggardjr,10, Spectacular thriller,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" is a classic thriller. I think this is Hitchcock's second best movie (his best is ""Psycho""). It has everything. Thrills, action, suspense, comedy, and great performances. Cary Grant has never been better as Roger Thornhill, a man who gets in way over his head when he's framed for murder. James Mason is terrific as the head bad guy, Martin Landau (35 years before his Oscar-winning role in ""Ed Wood"") is scary as one of Mason's henchmen, and Eva Marie Saint is wonderful as the mystery woman who helps Grant out and falls in love with him. ""North by Northwest"" is a very exciting adventure that never gets boring for one minute. There are lots of great scenes in this film. From an intoxicated Grant driving a car to get away from the bad guys early on to the dust-cropping scene midway through to the Mount Rushmore scenes late, I was into this film from the fascinating opening credits to the thrilling climax. The Master of Suspense as made some classic movies. ""North by Northwest"" is definitely one of them.",

378,5 April 2001,bat-5,10, Wonderful.,"There are certain films in existance that you can watch over and over and they will always remain fresh and vibrant as the day they were released.  North By Northwest is one such film. Filled with the usual Hitchcock themes, the movie begins innocently enough when Roger Thornhill calls for a bell boy calling for a George Caplan.  From there, he's whisked into a world of murder, espionage, smuggling and late night romances aboard trains.  The suspense and plot build together as we, along with Thornhill, try to figure out what's happening, and try not to get killed along the way.  Among the films highlights is the infamous crop duster sequence, in which Hitchcock shows you that even in the middle of nowhere, there is still danger. Cary Grant is perfectly cast as the rather quick witted Roger O. Thornhill. Eva Marie Saint is the prerequisite blonde Eve Kendall who helps Thornhill in his quest.  The always wonderful James Mason is oily and sinister as Phillip Vandamm,  and Martin Landau hides a hidden menace behind his slightly crooked grin. Throw in a wonderful score from Bernard Herrmann, a top notch script from Ernest Lehman and masterful direction from Alfred Hitchcock, and you have a movie that you can never grow tired of.   Plus, you have to love that last shot.",

Listening to the ""making of"" documentary and the commentary by Ernest Lehman dubbed over the movie it is hard to believe that this film was largely forgotten because of the new wave of action movies ie Mr Connery and friends.  Even though nearly every secret is revealed on the DVD, this only helps to enhance the impact of every scene and visual.  Incredibly, Ernest Lehman did not know how to end the movie at Mount Rushmore until he came up with the idea that Eve shots Roger in the dining room area.  Cherish every scene and every line of dialogue as Cary Grant delivers some very funny lines at the expense of the bad guys.  By the way, it's true, Martin Landau was a very strange looking guy at the time and an absolute perfect piece of casting in the role of the sinister and some would say homosexual Leonard.  The very last ""train zooming into a tunnel"" scene may be a little corny, but you've probably had enough suspense (in the cornfield?) thanks to Hitch and Bernard Hermann's rousing score (that tune just gets to you after a while).Sit back and enjoy the master at work.",

First, I can't imagine a more inept criminal justice system than in Glen Cove: (a) cops crashing their car into a fleeing drunk driver (b) detectives that easily could have exposed the phony Mrs. Townsend (hard to believe they did not already know that the real one was deceased) with a few basic checks, such as the supposed arrival of Thornhill by taxi, his companions at the Oak Bar, the time and circumstances of the theft of the Mercedes, the party guest list, etc. (c) a lawyer letting his client without objection to go to trial on felony charges only one day after the preliminary hearing, and (d) a judge permitting such a quick trial, then letting Thornhill out on bail if his story was supposedly so phony. Second, the scene involving the ""United States Intelligence Agency"" (staying so secret by being conveniently plopped right in the middle of the National Mall with the Capitol background shot) could have been deleted, leaving the mystery of Kaplan's identity for later resolution; the plot would have been enhanced that much more. Third, the scene in the Chicago train station with the cops checking all the red caps was a bit of a stretch; my recollection of 1950's America was that most of them were of a different ethnicity than that shown in the film.",

That said his thought processes and psychological forays invariably escape my narrative comprehension !
Intricate ( no doubt well constructed ) as I suppose they always are , land me in exasperating confusion mounted on more confusion ?
In my opinion THE BIRDS in its entirety was an unequivocal waste of my time , A truly one fact story which groaned on till a welcome
long awaited finale ! Even writing this review is a painful reminder of tiresome blah blah blah. Rear window was watchable and even
acceptable as an interesting and possible real life occurrence , great acting and cleverly executed . North by N W seemed to have so
many unanswered details, which the viewer can decide on for themselves ? After the crop scene, who informed him which hotel to
go to and was that a hick town or not, as judging from hotel lobby , furniture , decor etc. that was at least an expensive venue, which
on a sweltering hot night he still had his suit, shirt unruffled and tie in tact after what surely would have been a pretty long walk ?

Bernard Hermann is a musical master and genius and there has not been anyone before or since that compares to his consistent creativity and this is one of his best. Listen to the music from the first opening credits to the scene on the streets and you will hear some of the best compositions since Stravinsky and Beethoven. (He also did ""Psycho"", ""Twilight Zone"" and so many other fabulous scores.) You may think that John Williams music is great, and he is, including all the latest Harry Potter films, but the only thing that he did that comes close to Bernard Hermann is his music for ET, the motor cycle chase in Indiana Jones III, Duel of the Fates and the Droid battle in Star Wars I. Hans Zimmerman, another great film scorer, has tremndous creativity, often more than John Williams, but anything he did and, for that matter, anyone else to date, has never been better than Bernard Hermann; and this movie is one of his best. An essential ingredient to every great movie is an even better musical score and this one of the best examples of this. Musically, previous to Bernard Hermann was Max Steiner, who wrote the score for ""Gone With The Wind"", and before him was the most creative genius in all of film history, Charles Chaplin (who wrote, directed, acted, and scored all of his films!

And attempting to get rid of Kaplan by pouring bourbon down his gullet and crashing a car? That's the best they can do? And Vandamm and company simply commandeer the Townsend manse? Is it that easy to do, to just waltz into the home of UN diplomat and take it over? Thornhill gets on the train to Chicago without a ticket too easily. And why not just do a drive-by while Thornhill is waiting in that Indiana cornfield? Killing him from a plane is easier than that? And the final sequence of switching from the scene with Eve dangling from Mt. Rushmore, to Thornhill pulling Eve up into bed - at first I thought it was awfully hokey. But I can also see another side to it: Hitchcock perhaps snubbing his nose at the usual damsel in distress being saved finale that everyone was expecting.

Among the various cult that bear his signature one of the best known is this ""North by Norhwest"" a film that deserves to be remembered as such but which suffers, perhaps more than its other major films, of an aging fairly felt as far as it affects the rhythm and fluidity of it, unfortunately this affects the general vision, especially in our days when we are accustomed to extremely fast thrillers to appear almost exasperated.
It is incredible, however, that despite this great obstacle due to its age (about sixty years) the film manages to transmit, in the first half in a more fluctuating manner and in the second in a more diluted and concrete way, a strong suspense, element that distinguishes virtually all movies of the master, which allows the whole story to be followed with great interest, fundamental aspect in a film of this kind.
To make this possible is the excellent screenplay that, among ingenious narrative cues, sought-after twists and iconic and intelligent dialogues, makes everything an amiably elegant and fascinating package in full spy style that is still envious today. Also giving away the excellent characters interpreted in a particularly natural and credible way by names such as Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint, which make them irresistible and absolutely pleasant to see.
Hitchcock, in addition to its tasty initial cameo, gives the film an admirable direction: each shot is chosen with great attention to detail, especially those concerning the environment, each functional and peculiar, and shows a genius in always choosing the 'angle that can enhance the scene at best.
Unfortunately, as I said the film is not light, although this is really subjective as an aspect, and because of this it fails to reach its full potential and losing a bit of its charisma and character that would make it a film easier to remember and, in a sense, to be seen; but one thing is certain any cinephile should see it just to learn something more about the cinema.",

Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is kidnapped by two thugs working for a crafty criminal, played by James Mason; Grant is mistaken for purely someone else. He finds himself soon taken with Eve Kendall, a beautiful-yet-cold woman played excellently by Eva Marie Saint, who is a double agent for all practical purposes, working for the CIA(?) and the crafty criminal who must be caught. Grant is his suave self, and Eva Marie Saint is very appealing.Yes, it is easier for him to solve the mystery into which he is unvoluntarily absorbed than to win Eva Kendall's affection. The three settings (New York, Chicago, and Mount Rushmore) contribute to the intrigue of the movie. The climb around Mount Rushmore is tense, though, of course, it is not the real mount itself, just a large, convincing replica. The South Dakota scenery, however, is beautiful, the comical aspects of the movie are entertaining, and the well-constructed a la Alfred Hitchcock plot maintains well the viewers' (viewer's) attention. An outstanding cinematic feat for Mr. Hitchcock.",

Alfred Hitchcock knocked it out of the park with this film.

Needless to say, expectations were high. How could this film possibly compare to ""The Birds"", ""Marnie"", ""Notorious"", or ""Rear Window""?? I am happy to say that my expectations were not only met, they were surpassed. This is another GREAT Hitchcock film. Cary Grant's talent is especially showcased here. His dry wit and delivery of his (well-written) lines made me literally laugh out loud in places. I am becoming convinced that Hitchcock is the modern equivalent of Shakespeare- that his work is perpetually as timely and appealing as it was at the time it was produced.

Not only does it star Cary Grant--still (at age 55) and always one of the best-looking leading actors ever, it's directed by Alfred Hitchcock, co-stars Eva Marie Saint, James Mason and Martin Landau, and has a brilliant script. I'd expected something scary and suspenseful in an atmospheric way, and I *did* get that--but 'North By Northwest' is so much more. It has incredible dialogue, for one thing, played to the hilt by Grant (surely the best and most subtle comedic actor ever). And that's still not all! Comedic element aside, it's also a romance film (check out the scenes between Grant and Saint: some of them border on pseudo-funny, but most of them are electric), an action flick (the scene on Mount Rushmore, the exhilarating cropduster scene), and a good old-fashioned spy thriller. Definitely two of the best hours I've ever spent in a cinema (I didn't want the film to end, and when it did, I didn't want to leave!), and hours I will happily spend again in front of the television, rewatching this film on DVD. 10/10!",

456,30 March 2000,critic-22,9, Great Entertainment.........,North by Northwest,
457,22 June 2002,tripper0,9, doesn't entirely hold up today.....,"Most of this film holds up entirely well by today's standards.  There is excellent suspense and some extremely memorable scenes, specifically the one of the plane chasing Cary Grant.  The only real problem with the movie is the famous Mount Rushmore sequence.  Most of the time Hitchcock never relied on special effects to create suspense, and it doesn't stand the test of time here. We've been treated to some amazing looking things as of late, and its hard to believe that the characters are in any real danger while they are supposedly on the face(no pun intended)of the mountain.  Its a shame, because up until that point the film was perfect.  Cary Grant plays his part well, a very suave man, and his usual fast talking self.  Eva Marie Saint is a great partner for Grant.  Of Grant's Hitchcock movies (including 'Notorious' and 'To Catch a Thief') I feel that this was the best chemistry he had with the lead actress, and I mean no disrespect to Ingrid Bergman or Grace Kelly, who are both brilliant.  Hitchcock's direction is superb, which should come as no surprise.  The beauty of this film is that it is Hitchcock on autopilot.  'Vertigo', made the year before this film, was a movie that you really had to pay attention to to get all the details.  It's nice to see that he made complex movies as well as great suspense movies that are extremely well paced and very entertaining.  It was what Hitch liked the best I think, a wrongly accused man involved in an international plot he knows nothing about.  Would have been perfect if not for the Mount Rushmore scene.  9.5 out of 10.",
458,29 October 2008,kevinschwoer,8, A timeless thriller and a showcase of Hitchcock's film-making power,"A gut wrenching, on the edge of your seat thrill ride is more of an experience than a film. Hitchcock's North by Northwest is a masterful adventure film which throws the audience right in with the lot of the character which reverberates with a tension so thick that you would need a chainsaw to cut it. The film builds off the issue of stolen identity and what Hitchcock does is leave the viewer with just as little knowledge as his main character played by Cary Grant. The film takes no time to pick up the story literally throwing the character into something bigger than him, a very much over his head. The time is so short from when we see the character about his daily life to when he is accused of being someone else that the viewer isn't quite sure who he really is. Hitchcock leaves the viewer lost just as Grant is, giving the plot a forward momentum to find the truth. Later Hitchcock reveals that the government knows about the whole mix up and will do nothing about it which will lead to Grant's death. This is the classic Hitchcock: letting the audience know about something that the character doesn't know, especially something which effects said character. Grant's acting is stiff yet the array of colorful characters around him, and the lighthearted screenplay, allows this to go relatively unnoticed. Instead, Grant's adventure is positively enjoyable especially the electric chemistry between Eva Marie Saint and Grant. The lighthearted elements really come out n their early scenes together which allows Grant to flex his witty, comedic muscles. The climax of the film is set against a history landmark, Mount Rushmore. Hitchcock, who is known for such set pieces, uses the famous monument to show a side which audiences have never seen, literally right up the president's noses. In the end North by Northwest proves to be one of Hitchcock's greatest thrillers highlighting corruption in the government and throughout the world. It will keep audiences on the edge of their seats even today, showing that Hitchcock's genius transcends time.",

When the run is done, the final product goes worn down by dramatic limitations, as well as tonal unevenness, believability lapses and, of course, an overblown structure, but through excellent score work by Bernard Herrmann, sharp cinematography by Robert Burks, thoroughly clever writing by Ernest Lehman, an electrically charismatic lead performance by Cary Grant, and a lively directorial performance by Alfred Hitchcock, all behind a grandly adventurous and intriguing story concept, ""North by Northwest"" stands strong as a thoroughly entertaining affair that may be Hitchcock's most realized classic.",

It is in that style and if not a 10 out of 10 it is enjoyable and an 8 or 9 out of 10. Yes Hitchcock did make classic films before his move to America so don't forget them.

It's almost impossible to make a good movie from a bad script but very easy to make a bad film from a good script. And here we have 2 of the best joining together to make a film that only asks us to enjoy. But unlike other films that do that this one stays in the memory and will be talked about as long as we talk about film. I hope. It's also a lesson in the importance of strong direction. Mm - a strong director. I understand that Cary Grant was not shy in putting forward his ideas. A big star with a weak director can easily ruin a movie changing everything to make their part bigger. Or simply imposing bad ideas because they are a big star. Let's face it, most actors can barely sign their own name. The suit has been talked about at length in other places and in a brilliant essay taking the suits point of view. The very best thing I think is the wonderful use of colour in every frame. There are lots of scenes where you can hit the pause button and just marvel at the colour and the composition of the frame.

Why do I think this is the greatest film of all time? (a) The plot is solid (b) The cinematography is eye candy (c) Not one hesitation in action. As I am watching the film I notice that every action sequence was original and therefore copied by every action film after 1959. Cary Grant dominates every seen. The dialog is brilliantly written and it's safe to say, no action film will ever come close to topping North by Northwest.",

496,26 October 2012,ChristophCinema,10, A fun film for everyone,"When I was a kid, I was a huge Alfred Hitchcock fan. Even though most of his films were complex and I didn't understand a lot of the big words the actors were using, I just always loved watching them. As a child, I wasn't into older movies. I loved the classic Disney movies, I loved the Universal monster movies, but anything else, I didn't care for. It wasn't until I was about 12 that I began getting into all the classics. This is when my obsession with Hitchcock films began, and continued for years to come. It's hard to pick a favorite film of his because he's made so many classics, but I'm going to ultimately say that North by Northwest is my favorite. Why? Well there are many reasons. First of all the characters are just classic Hitchcock. When I was a kid, I really looked up to Cary Grant's character. I love how he comes off as so smooth, yet so over his head. It's been said that Grant's performance had a great influence on the character, James Bond, and I'm not surprised. Cary Grant just steals the show here. Just the way he talks, and the way he handles things, you believe that something like this would happen to him. The villains are kind of cliché, but that's what makes them so great. And of course, there's Eva Marie Saint as the beautiful female lead. Hitchcock's female characters were always awesome, because on the surface, they just seemed like a pretty face, but as the films unravel, we find out there's a lot more to them. You never know what to expect with these women, and that's what makes them so addicting. The last thing I must mention about this movie is how big it is. Every Hitchcock film has a certain look to it. They're all visually appealing (which is one of the reasons I liked them so much as a kid). Vertigo has a surreal, dream like world. Rear Window has an enclosed, claustrophobic world. North by Northwest just has this grand scope. From the city, to the fields in the middle of nowhere, to Mount Rushmore, this film just has a grand look to it, and goes perfectly with its grand story. Like I said, North by Northwest is just a fun movie. With its great characters, great story, great comedy, great suspense, and great visuals, it feels just like a comic book. I think this is a movie that anyone can get into. If you've never seen a Hitchcock film, North by Northwest is a good place to start (it's what got me into Hitchcock). And one last thing; this movie has my favorite Hitchcock cameo. That is all.",
497,28 August 2006,Aldri7,8, fun to see again,"The greatness of North by Northwest may be measured in part by its imitators. Two of my favorite movies, both made since 1959, are ""Silver Streak"" and ""The Sting"". Both were very popular movies that borrowed heavily from it. It is easy to look back now, see the scenes with Cary Grant on the train, and say "" I've seen this before"". Sure, in ""Silver Streak"", which had Gene Wilder and Jill Clayburgh trading sexual innuendos across the dinner table (""I give great phone"" was one line) just as Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint did. Or to watch the climactic gun battle between Robert Redford and Paul Newman in ""The Sting"" and have the same reaction. Both of these movies, made in the 70's, were big hits, but how many people knew that Hitchcock deserved half the credit? ",

This is a movie about Russian spies and American spies but BELIEVE me, you don't have to have a clue about spies to enjoy this movie.

503,13 November 2005,Percivalx,10, Hitchcock's thrilling game of cat-and-mouse!,"Exhilaration, anxiety, and tension all describe North by Northwest, Hitchcock's masterpiece about mistaken identity. Manhattan advertising executive Roger Thornhill is kidnapped by a gang of spies led by debonair Phillip Vandamm. Vandamm believes Thornhill is George Kaplan, a CIA agent supposedly working to stop him from exporting a valuable statue full of top-secret microfilm. After his first attempt at murdering Thornhill (or Kaplan) fails, Thorhnill is chased across the Midwest in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse. What makes this movie so much fun to watch is the fact that it starts going from frame one and doesn't stop until the very end. The action unfolds seamlessly, no scene is wasted, and even has comedic touches. This is in partly due to Ernest Lehman's rich screenplay. He wrote other films full of great dialogue ( Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf, Sweet Smell of Success) but in North by Northwest, he is at his peak. The dialogue between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint at the train dinner table, for example, is full of awesome sexual innuendo. The Master of Suspense uses his mastery of direction by creating yet another suspenseful story full of excitement and mystery. The luscious photography and tension-building musical score are attributed to the masterminds of Robert Burks and Bernard Herrmann, respectively. Be on the look out for many unforgettable scenes--the auction scene, the crop duster scene, the Mt. Rushmore sequence and many more in between. Highly Recommended!",

The legendary crop-dusting sequence alone is a master class in the art of pure cinema. Like the rest of the film, it's brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed. All the elements come together to produce the finest form of entertainment. Bernard Herrmann's frantic fandango captures the complexity and pace of the action.

Actually suggesting a sexual relation in her first sentences to our hero, played by Cary Grant. In the year of 1959 I am certain that this was not something one did every now and then, as it is not even yet practised in our own time.

Like most Hitchcock films, this one is loaded with suspense and is credited as one of his best plots. It starts out seeming like a typical man wrongly accused where you think you're going to have to wait until the end for him to prove his innocence. Then the story takes multiple twists and turns including weaving in a love story that has its own unexpected surprises. Some great aspects of this film are the fantastic shots with incredible camera angles, the suspenseful soundtrack, and using some awesome locations to shoot. I think this was a great Hitchcock picture definitely worth checking out.",

This movie demonstrates a lot of camera angles including close ups, establishing shots, tracking shots, over the shoulder shots, high shot, and many others. The action portrayed in this movie is amazing and the editors did a great job with what they had to work with. The scene that sticks out to me most is obviously the scene where they're on Rushmore and the men start rolling down the mountain slowly mid fight, the music starts to pick up loud and cause a dramatic feeling as you witness a near death fight. Where finally one of the men throw the other clean off the mountain. The effect of the mountain and backgrounds look amazing fir a film this old and showcase the great editing skills on the people behind this film. The movie uses many different lighting effects with the mountain scene being dark with a singular light source being the moon which is well done. The music in the background of this movie goes a long way and really strengthens the emotions of the viewers while watching this.

514,10 November 2000,clive-38,10, A magnificent Hitchcock thriller with impressive set pieces and strong cast,"Director Alfred Hitchcock made many first rate films during his long career both in England and in Hollywood and with ""North by Northwest"" reached the top of his form with an original story written specially for the screen by Ernest Lehman and a perfect cast including several Hitchcock regulars.  The dramatic music by Bernard Herrmann greatly added to my overall enjoyment of the film.  This is a fast moving witty thriller in magnificent Technicolor with Cary Grant as Roger O. Thornhill giving the performance of a lifetime. Grant is mistaken for government agent George Kaplan and is thrust into one life threatening situation after another on the run from both the police and the bad guys! It's a roller coaster ride of thrills, suspense, comedy and romance skilfully put together with the expert Hitchcock touch. There are some spectacular set pieces in unusual locations such as the United Nations Building, New York's Grand Central Station, Mount Rushmore and who can forget the famous crop dusting sequence at Prairie Stop on deserted Highway 41.  Cary Grant wears the same suit throughout the film but stil manages to look as elegant as ever despite the many tricky and dangerous situations he finds himself in!  James Mason has never been better as the sinister Phillip Vandamm intent on eliminating Cary with the help of his two menacing associates Adam Williams and Robert Ellestein who played their villainous parts very convincingly. Eva Marie Saint was the usual Hitchcock ice cool blonde heroine while Jessie Royce Landis was excellent as Cary Grant's mother although in reality she was only a few months older than Grant! (They were both born in 1904). This actress was also with Cary Grant in another Hitchcock film ""to Catch a Thief"" in which she played Grace Kelly's mother. Martin Landau was impressive in his first screen role as the vicious Leonard trying to get rid of Cary at every opportunity! Veteran actor Leo G. Carroll was making his sixth appearance in a Hitchcock film as the CIA/FBI Agent known only as the ""Professor"". One of my favourite actresses Doreen Lang had the small part of Grant's secretary Maggie and can also be seen in other Hitchcock films such as ""The Wrong Man"" and ""The Birds"". Surprisingly, ""North by Northwest"" did not win any Oscars and Hitchcock, Cary Grant and the film itself were not even nominated which in retrospect was a regrettable oversight. It was unfortunate that this was the year when ""Ben Hur"" scooped the awards and won an amazing total of 11 Oscars. The films nominated for Best Picture that year were ""Ben Hur"" (the winner), ""Anatomy of a Murder"", ""Diary of Anne Frank"", ""The Nun's Story"" and ""Room at the Top"".  Looking at these titles today it is unbelievable to me that ""North by Northwest"" could not have been included in the nominations.  The best actor Oscar went to Charlton Heston for ""Ben Hur"" and the other nominees were Laurence Harvey (""Room at the Top""), Jack Lemmon (""Some Like It Hot""), Paul Muni (""The Last Angry Man""), and James Stewart (""Anatomy of a Murder""). Ernest Lehman's Oscar nominated story and screenplay was full of gems including Jessie Royce Landis asking the would-be assassins: ""You gentlemen aren't really trying to kill my son are you?"". And Grant to Leo G. Carroll: ""I'm an advertising man, not a red herring! I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex wives and several bartenders dependent upon me and I don't intend to disappoint them all by getting myself slightly killed!"".  A Hitchcock masterpiece. 10/10.  Not to be missed. Clive Roberts.",

I like how when they're climbing down Mount Rushmore how the camera is filming not straight but kind of at an angle. I think the color looked nice and the picture in general; it looked crisp and clean. The outfits are nice; one thing I have learned is Alfred Hitchcock and Eva Marie Saint went shopping for her characters clothing to make it more authentic and more of the actress's style. I thought the acting was good; at some point in the film when Eva Marie Saint's character is in danger or is feeling guilty, you can see that feeling in her face and eyes even if she's not talking.

Yet, consider this: in a three year span, Hitchcock crafted Vertigo, North By Northwest, and Psycho, each film a distinctly American classic, each film a template for all subsequent films of the genre to follow and imitate, each film still eminently watchable and compelling.

You can see the similarities of Hitchcock's directing style in this film compared to his other film ""psycho"".

526,16 November 2020,pietoso,8, Only Ad Men Have Wings,"Adeptly balancing the essence of a thriller with a frequently lighthearted and comedic tone, North by Northwest displays the famous craftsmanship of its iconic director, Alfred Hitchcock, while serving as an ideal showcase for its considerably talented star. Cary Grant is perfectly cast in his role as advertising exec Roger Thornhill, a man so wily and even slimily credible that he is easily mistaken for a spy, and soon manages to actually fulfill the part as events demand. His love interest is played by Eva Marie Saint, excellently opaque and mysterious as long as the script requires, although less enjoyable as she becomes something of the reformed maiden in need of our hero's deliverance. Unfortunately the film seems to make something of a minor habit of this, presenting genuinely compelling ideas and playing with them to our torment, only to abandon them for convention once a conclusion is called for. Overall though, the film generates a considerable degree of excitement and certain scenes, one involving a crop duster and another a famous national monument, carry a great deal of momentum and form a lasting impression. The former especially shows the genius of Hitchcock at work: an innocuous thing becomes conspicuous, then ambiguously threatening, growing on the horizon until it's revealed as the image of death itself. A shot of Grant running like a madman through desolate farm field, imminent doom swooping down from behind him, is as immediately real in our sensory experience as any. But at its best, the film seems to insert subtle commentary through philosophical vectors: is there such an incredible difference between the manipulations of an ad man versus a government spook? Is the American system as benevolent as it suggests, or is it sometimes disturbingly inhumane in its adherence to pragmatism? Thornhill certainly approaches these issues as he flees from each progressive threat, but ultimately the film seems more interested in asking such questions than answering them; doubtless it thrives on this uncertainty by its very nature. For a film addressing the complexities and frequent ugliness of Cold War intrigues, it manages an impressive feat by maintaining a humorous composure despite its realistically uncomfortable premise. Although it avoids further depth, it presents a dreamlike odyssey across '50s America without losing sight of its paramount function: to entertain.",

North by Northwest would most certainly belong in his mainstream films category and would most certainly be his best easily within that respective category and possibly his best film period. ",
531,19 September 2004,noxid100,10, Hitchcock and Cary Grant at the top of their game.,"One of those great flicks you don't mind watching over again every year or so. Top drawer suspense, all wrapped up in sophistication and some of the best man/woman chemistry ever captured on film. Definitely the highlight of Eve Marie-Saint's career. (I'm betting she'd agree.) Cary Grant was never better. And Alfred Hitchcock, some of whose work made me wonder why he was so celebrated, truly got it right in this movie. Some of the more memorable scenes: Cary Grant creeping along a ledge, high above street level, and slipping through an open window into a sleeping woman's hotel room. ""Stop!"" she cries out when she sees someone coming through the window. Then, as Grant hurries through the room toward the door, glancing at her and apologizing, she more entreats than commands, ""Stop!"" The way the movie ends is as good as it gets, but I won't spill the beans here. Watch this movie when it comes along, if you haven't already done so at least once.",

Trying to find who Mr. Kaplan was and why they wanted him had me at the edge of my seat. Hitchcocks odd use of color made the screen pop with color for example the taxi. The use of the different shots and angles show a little bit more of the directors technique and letting the audience infer more about the film. Some techniques were very clever for example using a painting instead of the real house and a treadmill for people who were walking. It had you on your toes and laughing at the same time. And the scenes the director choose had meaning to it even if it seemed so simple like the ending. The film was great and worth watching.,
533,10 May 2010,manjavhern,10," Alfred Hitchcock, enough said!","I saw this film for film history class, and I am not addicted to all Alfred Hitchcock films! Ever since I can remember I heard of films by Alfred Hitchcock and barely saw his film North by Northwest, and now I know why he is considered a master of film. The film was top notch from beginning to end. I could not get enough from the brilliant story and characters. The comedy was so great in the movie that I could not stop laughing the whole time with so smart and witty dialogue. The movie was suspenseful and entertaining, one of Alfred Hitchcock's areas of perfection. A case of mistaken identity, witty characters and humor, throw in a love interest and you have a great movie done by a wonderful director. The scene on top of the U.N. building was a beautiful spectacle and should be viewed on the big screen in high def. Even today the film is held with high standards and referenced a throughout many TV shows and films. The infamous airplane scene is still paid homage today. The protagonist is a regular guy who just happens to be at the right spot at the wrong time and be mistaken for someone who doesn't exist. The ending did seem to drag on a bit, then just end abruptly, but other than that I had no complaints about the movie. I loved how Alfred Hitchcock stuck it to the man by having the train enters the tunnel in the end, to reference sexual activity between the couple, when the production company did not want a love scene between the two in the end; a masterful loop hole found and used to the advantage of the director and audience. Everyone should see the movie at least one time, and guaranteed you will enjoy this fun filled comedic ride of a movie. From there you will be addicted to all Alfred Hitchcock movies and beg for more.",
534,7 May 2010,Keltxangel,10, North by Northwest,"I really enjoyed North by Northwest. I think that the plot was exciting and unraveled as the film went on. In the beginning, it's as if you are Roger Thornhill because you become just as confused as he about why he is being kidnapped. When Eve is introduced, I didn't really think much of her, I just thought she was a love interest. Her role as a spy seemed different for the time because not many women were put in such a powerful role. The look of the film is very pleasing to the eye, the costumes and the colors are very vibrant and kept my attention. The suspense of the film was very captivating, it kept me wondering what was going to happen next. Even when Roger gets ""shot"" in the cafeteria, I was afraid that it was over and that he wouldn't make it. Alas, it was a trick and that same trick gun would end up saving him again later in the film.",

Which was done so he would kill himself, but he manages to control himself and drive off. The camera shows an MCU of him and shows the camera fuzzy and shakey portraying that he is drunk.

The best thing that can be said is that the film is visually very nice to look at, like a pretty painting in a museum. Late 1950s New York and America look so nice, clean and orderly.

Lowry Digital Images did the restoration and I'm telling you that this DVD looks as good as I've ever seen a DVD look.

Many of the elements that made this film a success and enjoyable to watch become staples in the later Bond movie series.

Here's some parts of this motion picture I want to point out some interesting moments in this movie: In the mid-to-end part of this movie, Cary Grant's character gets stuck in the desert and gets chased by a crop duster plane into a wheat field. Why did the crop duster chase him? Well, he became a wanted man when he drove a stolen automobile under the influence of Alcohol. What else can I point out in this movie that I'm sure no one else will: When Eva Marie Saint's character falls off Mount Rushmore, Cary Grant's character rescues her from the evil motorcyclists who don't like him. That is why this movie became an Oscar Winning motion picture and won 10 nominations and Grammy awards.

Give a genius a big enough budget, and let him create! Hitchcock wasn't content with any ordinary house to be the villain's headquarters -- it had to be a specially-constructed Frank Lloyd Wright house, on a studio set. And why Mount Rushmore? I've spent years thinking about why he chose that one. Did Ernest Lehman write a script and submit it to Hitchcock, or did Hitchhock go to Lehman and say, ""Write me a script with these elements""? Or did they meet in a room and collaborate? There is lots of money being spent in lots of places. Hitchcock couldn't just film in a grove of trees -- again, it had to be on a perfectly-controlled studio set, where I would imagine every tree was placed exactly correct. I can think of entire movies being shot on the budget it must have taken to create that forest. So sit back and relax and be entertained. I still marvel at the dinner table scene between Roger and Eve, the dialogue timed perfectly with the action outside the window as the train slows down, stops, and two policemen get out of a car. Beautiful scene, like clockwork.",
544,4 May 2010,butler-britney,10, North By Northwest,"Let me start by saying Alfred Hitchcock is an absolute genius. North by Northwest is one of his best and encompasses everything that is Hitchcock. Hitchcock once stated a director has to tell the audience what is about to happen to create suspense. If a bomb is about to go off, the director needs to show them the bomb about to go off, but then never delver. Instead of the expected action one must provide an unexpected action instead. North by Northwest (Alfred Hitchcock, US 1959, 131 min.) definitely uses this idea. Roger O. Thornhill, played by Cary Grant (A very attractive man) is an advertising executive who is mistaken as George Kaplan, a government agent, by a criminal gang. As he tries to clear his name and find the actual George Kaplan he experiences many adventures and is introduced to the beautiful Eve Kendall, actress Eve Marie Saint. Throughout the entire story one adventure leads to another and each one provides and unexpected turn of events. George Kaplan, whom Roger is searching turns out to be made up by the government. Eve turns out to be working for the gang, but then turns out to be a double agent. Roger's life depends on the success or failure of the Government obtaining needed information from the gang, which possibly will cost him the new love of his life. Hitchcock's techniques and creative decisions never fail to impress. The detail and artistic direction are superb. The cinematography, the locations, and the mise en scene are beautiful. The development of each character through story, dialogue, and artistically is something to strive for. It is said Hitchcock would accompany his actors to find their costumes because he wanted every detail of the character to develop him or her. As a filmmaker I definitely look up to Hitchcock and strive to accomplish what he has. So far I have discovered it is all about the details.",

548,16 November 2020,eawelkley,9, A Bond film in everything but name,"North By Northwest is what I consider to be a classic spy thriller, the likes of which you don't often see in the 21st century. There's very little in the way of over the top action, and it is much more subtle than most modern spy films, and even the Bond saga, which began just 4 years after the release of this film. Following our title character, Roger Thornhill (played by the late, great, Cary Grant), as he is roped into what may well be the worst case of mistaken identity ever, which then blossoms into a story of international espionage at what would soon be the height of the cold war. But after watching it Some of my favorite things about this movie include the shot that was taken from the outside of the U.N building, since Hitchcock was not able to get permission to film inside of the building itself, and the famous crop duster scene, which will go down in my memory as one of the more unusual encounters from any movie. And furthermore, the ending was a surprisingly happy one, which I was not expecting from the tone of everything else. Definitely recommended for spy movie fans, they'll get a kick out of it.",

The Bernard Herrmann score pulls you in right away with the opening credits, then Cary Grant and Hitchcock, along with a fantastic supporting cast, propel you from scene to scene...the film just flies. When the ""love theme"" begins while Grant and Eve Marie Saint are traveling on the train, I couldn't believe how moving the scene was, and the actors were completely clothed, and either standing or seated. Amazing. As for the story in general, the screenplay is nothing less than superb. I can pick this film up anywhere in the story and it still captivates me. The tension is finely tuned, and the sets are perfect.  To ""tedg"", who has a problem with this movie, I say: you take yourself too seriously. Hitchcock, Grant, James Mason and many of the cast are dead now, but this fine film lives on and on, and for many very good reasons: directing, script, score, acting, acting, acting, sets and great chemistry all around.

Thornhill is mistaken as a government agent. He is pursued across the country by people trying to kill him. This film is very well made and the director was one of the best in the business. Alfred Hitchcock knew how to make a movie. He paid attention to details in his movies. He knew how to make the audience have the reaction he wanted. The main character in this film, Roger O. Thornhill, was played by Cary Grant. He plays his character very well. His character comes across as the type of person that is trying to figure out what is going on. This film is filled with suspenseful scenes. An example is the many chase scenes of the movie, the audience doesn't know if the police or secret agents will catch him. The audience will always be engaged with the movie during these types of scenes because they can't look away during one of these chase scenes because if they do, they might miss something. Hitchcock is able to keep the audience interested the whole time, which is a big accomplishment even in today's Hollywood. The Female lead in this movie was ale excellent. The leading female character, ""Eva Marie Saint"" did an amazing job with her role. Her along with Cary Grant have great chemistry on the screen. Overall, this film was an amazing display of the talent that Alfred Hitchcock has. He manages to keep the audience interested in the film from start to finish using suspenseful scenes.

""The film that paved the way for Harrison Ford's career "" might be an apropriate epitath for this masterpiece of the genre. The wrong man is accused and he is an everyman who must become a hero and save the day. Chosen by the American Film Institute as well as SuperDave as one of American Film's 100 greatest accomplishments this film has a taunt spy thriller that doesn't require the mental engery and near PhD level intelligence (and caffeine high) that a LeCarre style spy film would require. However the screenplay original titled ""The Man in Lincoln's Ear"" is far from dumbed down. Hitchcock's favorite leading man looks suave and sexy in his suit and like all great Cary Grant performances he is appealing in his believability as much as the way he fills out his suit. Eva Marie Saint, an underapreciated actress of her day, is perfectly cast as the bad girl spy whom you never quite know which side she is on. Undenialbly James Mason makes his case for one of history's most underused villainous actors (before there was Alan Rickman...) While not as serious as some critics would like, it should not have to be. North By Northwest is a popcorn film, meant to entertain and thrill you and it does that in spades.

It has everything you would expect from Hitchcock, suspense, comedy, romance. Extremely well paced and entertaining.",
572,3 September 2003,Ezy_Ryder,10, Masterpiece,"I have watched this film countless times and there is always something new to be found in it. Splendid photography by Robert Burks. Every scene and line has its purpose. Colors are gorgeous on DVD. Of course the plot is not very believable, but who cares. Funny to see how the actors and places look so timeless and out of this word. This film has aged gracefully.",
573,24 March 2014,rabidrobertfan,10, Northwest Passage,"Confession-this is my favorite Hitchcock film but I do not consider it to be the best one. Nevertheless, North By Northwest, the 1959 suspense/adventure/thriller/romance/mystery starring Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint is still very worthy of the high acclamation it receives. It could very comfortably fit into any one of the five genres just listed and it is an incredibly fun movie to watch. Ordinary New York businessman Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is abducted and taken to a private mansion where enemy spies plotting against the U.S. government accuse him of being an American spy named George Kaplan. He repeatedly insists that he is not George Kaplan and after escaping, ends up running for his life through various states while being pursued by both the enemy spies and the police, who have framed him for murder. I will not reveal the rest of the plot as it would take me way too long to remember all the twists and turns. North By Northwest has some memorable scenes. The most famous one depicts Thornhill being chased by a crop duster plane. Also, the climax is pretty suspenseful as well. But I think what I love most about this movie is the way it has aged. It's fifty-five years old yet I still feel it could have been released last Friday and still have done as well financially as it did back in 1959. I guess if I had to say one thing against this film, it would be during the climb down Mt. Rushmore. Seriously, do you really think a man and woman could scale and climb down the steep sides of Mount Rushmore with any success while wearing dress shoes and high heels? But that's just me getting really picky. North By Northwest is so much fun to watch. The first time I saw it, I didn't even understand half of what was going on yet I still was enjoying the movie. I remember the second time I watched it, I had so much fun that when it was over, I just wanted to stick the DVD back in and watch it again immediately. Thankfully, I got the 50th Anniversary DVD for Christmas so maybe one day that will happen Oh, and one last note, the main theme to North By Northwest is probably my all-time favorite movie soundtrack theme. Overall, I love this movie way too much and if given the chance, I would even recommend it to my fellow school peers because I feel it's stood the test of time that well.",
574,17 April 2020,deowen10,10, Loved it.,"None of it makes any sense, but it was fun to watch, nonetheless. 10 stars for entertainment and 10 stars for pure absurdity.",
575,22 January 2023,dfrancocci,5," Great opening, but otherwise unwatchable","I thought I'd catch up on this classic as I've never seen it. The opening sequence is fabulous, with the music of Bernard Herrmann and the manic streets of new York - look out for the Hitchcock cameo. But when it came to the scene on the train when he's kissing the woman who's hiding him - frankly, it was unwatchable, and I had to switch it off. I mean, he's old enough to be her father!",
576,10 August 2006,cpj-3,8, Stellar for its time. Great today.,"I believe that this film is one that will be watched for generations to come, and that is not something I am willing to say of many films. The fact that it remains a much-loved film by all is enough to say it has stood the test of time. I much regret that I did not have the opportunity to see it when it first came out and was groundbreaking in its complexity and brilliance. It came out in a period where the vast majorities of mystery/thrillers were neither mysterious nor thrilling, yet this proved to be both, even today. Had I seen it when it first hit the big screen, I undoubtedly would have rated it 10/10, yet the reasons for the subtraction of points are minimal and probably anal. Firstly, while the ending on the obviously green-screened Mount Rushmore is thrilling, it came off as slightly cheesy, and not exactly the dynamic finish I have witnesses in some more recent thrillers. Secondly, I think that some of the scenes between Roger (Cary Grant) and Eve (Eva Marie Saint) drag on just a little too long for my taste, and although they are entertaining, they just don't fit in with the flow of the whole. All in all, though, I would say it is a thoroughly entertaining and exciting film, well worth seeing.",
577,5 December 2003,sawakatoome,10, The Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures?,"'North By Northwest' is not only one of Hitchcock's greatest films and greatest successes, its also one of his most influential, the influence felt on countless action flicks. Not least among them is the entire Bond franchise, at which has often been levelled accusations of 'ripping off' both Hitchcock in general and 'North By Northwest' in particular.",
578,1 September 2012,Npcibrahim,9, The best 5 Hitchcock,"If Vertigo is unanimously number one, North by Northwest ranks in the top 5, square with Rear Window,Psycho and Notorious in Hitchcock filmography.Why Vertigo? Because of the ingenious cinematographic technicalities of Robert Burks and the music score conducted by Bernard Hermann. Because of the novel D'entre les morts by Boileau et Narcejac. Needless to mention the Technicolor of red and gray of interiors and green and gold of giant sequoias. Kim Novak metamorphosis from a genuine brunette to a Hitchcock's placid blonde is disturbing to Stewart as well to spectators. The elegant silhouette of James Stewart marks all angles, plans and semi plans of Burks. The mysterious and unexpected thrilling drama crescendo contributes to the priority rank of this motion picture. North by Northwest cinematographer is also Robert Burks. Bernard Hermann is the music conductor . Cary Grant tall and elegant silhouette dominates angles and plans of action and exteriors. Eva Marie Saint is a Hitchcock's placid blonde . The theme is one of Alfred's favorite when an ordinary man is wrongly driven in an extraordinary situation ( as in The Wrong Man ,Rear Window,The Birds) is one of Alfred favorite's when an ordinary man is wrongly driven into an extra ordinary situation( as in The Wrong Man, Rear Window, The Birds).",
579,24 July 2005,gfarrand,10, North By Northwest,"The movie ""North by Northwest"" is in my top 10 movies of all time. It combines great suspense, sexual tension between Cary Grant and Eve Saint Marie, Hitchcock's beautiful use of location, color, film angles and monumental scenery. It also wouldn't have been the great movie it is without the evil characters portrayed by James Mason and Martin Landeau and cold blooded government spy played by Lewis J. Carroll, who baby boomers will remember from the TV ""Topper"" series. North by Northwest is one of those movies one can watch dozens of times and still notice something new. There doesn't seem to be anything that could have been changed in the movie without making it a less than perfect production.",
580,19 May 2005,brendanm194,9, The apotheosis of Hitchcock's film-making!,"PLOT DESCRIPTION While having lunch, advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) experiences misfortune just as a ""George Kaplan"" is being paged. From this point on, Thornhill's life is turned upside down. He is abducted by three mysterious men and whisked away to the palatial home of enemy spy Philip Vandamm. Denying that his name is Kaplan, Thornhill is at a complete loss when Vandamm begins grilling him for information. Finally, Thornhill is drugged, tossed into a car, and sent careening down a treacherous mountain road. He escapes this death trap only when his car is stopped by a pair of motorcycle cops. Unable to persuade the Law that his stories of kidnappings and enemy agents is true--he can't even convince his own mother--Thornhill takes the cops back to the mansion where he was held prisoner, only to find that Vandamm and company have cleared out, and that house is really owned by a United Nation ambassador.Tracking him down at the UN building, Thornhill tries to get the man's attention--whereupon the ambassador is knifed to death, and the nonplussed Thornhill left holding the weapon! Now a fugitive from justice, Thornhill tries to escape via train. En route, he meets the coolly beautiful Eve Kendall, who graciously hides him from the police. The apotheosis of Alfred Hitchcock's Hollywood career, North by Northwest is fast, funny, and exciting. The film contains far too many highlights to detail in this limited space: favorite bits include the crop duster dusting where there aren't any crops, the riotous auction scene, the mid-film murder of a principal character (or so it seems), and, of course, that nail-biting Mount Rushmore finale.",
581,22 November 1998,nester-2,7, straight-up action movie,"Not one of Hitchcock's better efforts, considering he is responsible for Vertigo, Rear Window and Psycho.  He seems to play this one a bit more straight up - less camera trickery and symbolism, and more of a straight-up James Bond thriller - excepting that Cary Grant is not a wilful James Bond. You can never go wrong with Cary Grant, though (""How does a girl like you get to be a girl like you."").  A fun movie, with my favorite movie scene of all time (the crop duster).  The action at the end is just too hokey, and it seems to get wrapped up just a bit too neatly, quickly, and easily.",
582,21 May 2000,svmoore,10, I have just seen this film on DVD and enjoyed for the millionth time a film of rare quality.,I have just seen this film on DVD and enjoyed for the millionth time a film of rare quality. I first saw NBNW when I was ten years old and have seen it so many times now that you begin to miss the detail and the polish this film has. A new DVD print has restored my memories of this great thriller. I wish I had seen it at a theatre. A tv screen does not do it justice. It amazes me that so many scenes from this film are still copied for tv ads and in other films. It doesn't date and still excites.,
583,6 July 2006,natemullins421,8, 1959 Spec Effects,"This is a great movie, and the Mount Rushmore chase part is probably the funniest because of the 1959 special effects when one of the villain's henchmen falls off a cliff. You have to see that part to understand what I'm talking about. This movie definitely likes trains, because a lot of the main character interaction occurs on a train. And of course, the best part of the entire movie is the ""cropduster"" when the main character is waiting in the middle of nowhere. It's the most thrilling and best part of the movie. Alfred Hitchcock is probably the best of his class I've ever known of, because he always comes up with something new, funny, or strangely thrilling. The UN scenes are great, and the entire movie leaves a good impression.",
584,18 March 2020,NotCreativeAtAll,8," Great Movie,But not the best","I Enjoyed this movie,it had a lot of memorable moments but imo it was a bit cheesy,but must watch",
585,8 January 2003,mattgreene,9," Easy to fault, impossible to dismiss","This movie sees Grant in absolutely tip-top form in perhaps the funniest thriller ever made. His grace under pressure and cheekiness mark this out as a defining performance. Martin Landau and James Mason are both excellent, as are the rest of the cast, although Landis does overplay for laughs as Grant's mother (interestingly, she was only one year his senior).",
586,4 June 2000,Rick-124,9, Excellent film from a master scenemaker!,"The acting's great, the script's great, and the movie's filled with suspense, but what's really memorable about NORTH BY NORTHWEST, like most of Hitchcock's films, is his ability to direct suspenseful, riveting, and masterful scenes.  The Rushmore sequence and the auction scene come to mind.",
587,4 June 2000,Beulahhh,9, One of Hitchcock's most brilliant!,"If you want to see both Alfred Hitchcock and Cary Grant at their finest, you must see this movie. This film is packed with every bit of the suspense of ""Rear Window,"" the plot twists of ""Psycho,"" and the charm and humor only Cary Grant could provide.  The auction scene is one of the best moments in film history.  And though you've seen it hundreds of times in movie clips, Grant's confrontation with the cropduster will keep you on the edge of your sofa.  This is definitely a must-see.",
588,6 January 2000,Andy-471,10, A brilliant film - dodgy recommendations,This has got to be one of the finest and most entertaining films ever made. The pace of the action never slackens and the plot though simple is well thought out. Cary Grant is his usual smooth self - only he could get away with such a ludicrous accent and the leading lady is well cast in the helpless-soon-to-be-a-right-bitch role. I am sure many other people have contributed their thoughts on the movie so I will sway away from that. The recommendations section groups films such as 'US Marshalls' in the same category as NBNW. Which tasteless cretin thought of that one? surely films such as Charade should be recommended? Never mind. Great film .Watch it!,
589,20 March 2000,bitwizard,10, You have to see this movie at least once in your life!,"North by Northwest is just a PERFECT movie, the actors, the plot, the locations and of course the director are great!

590,3 October 2000,aradford-2,10, the most engaging film ever made,"From start to finish, this film keeps you hooked, with magnificent acting, a super strong plot, and camera work that at times (we all know when) keeps you on the edge of your seat. Undeniably, Hitchcock's best.",
591,3 January 2001,lach94ac,10, A must-see for all thriller fans,"Probably Hitchcock at his best - relaxed and having fun during the shoot, and thereby encouraging the actors to make top performances.

592,5 September 2000,dickjan.braggaar,10, The perfect movie,"This one is incredible. I never saw a movie more entertaining than this one. People can wake me in the middle of the night for it. The 'fugitive' Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill is Mr. Kaplan. He is chased through the US. The cornfield, the climb on Mt.Rushmore, the train-scenes, marvellous. Only very minor snag is that the music is perfect but monophonic. Well, if that's all...Mr. Hitchcock, Mr.Grant, thanks.",

594,26 August 2006,billherold1017,10, Hitchcock takes you on a roller-coaster ride from New York to Mt Rushmore all on Cary Grant's capable shoulders,"One of Hitch's best and probably Cary Grant's Best. The scene in the elevator with Cary Grant and his mother and the scene at the auction are priceless. My wife and I still think that the man who Cary Grant steals the cab from later went on to play Les Nesmith in WKRP in Cincinatti. This is also a great chance to hear two of the most distinct voices in Movie history, Cary Grant and James Mason. This movie is a delight. Hitchcock also out does himself in picking of all places Mount Rushmore for the climax of the movie. It ranks right up there with the fight scene on the statute of Liberty with Bob Cummings in Saboteur. Hope you get hooked on Hitchcock like me. In conclusion, Hitchcock sets the pace for this non-stop thriller within 5 minutes of the movie and doesn't let go till after the credits. Throughout the entire movie, the one thread that holds it together is the composure of Grant through all the adversities thrown at him.",
595,11 October 2020,mznfc,9, Very good film,"Overall an excellent film. It doubtless had great influence on the subsequent 007 movies. However, since Fleming had written the first 7 Bond novels before this movie premiered, it clearly was not an influence there. Fleming's first Bond novel, Casino Royale, was published in 1953 with Goldfinger being published the same year as the movie release.",
