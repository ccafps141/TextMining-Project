0,19 January 2019,Hitchcoc,10, I Was Captivated,"I saw Don Shirley perform in college in 1966. At the time I simply thought he was a hell of a pianist, using that bass and cello to come up with a unique sound. So when this movie came along, I thought ""I saw that guy!"" I know the critics are being hard on this film, but I sat for two hours, totally captivated. I know there are stereotypes. Could that be because the repeated actions against minorities and the actions of racists have become so commonplace they seem like stereotypes. I believe the performances of these two fine actor made the show. There is a subtlety to this movie that transcends many others of its type. Yes, there are Southern cops; yes, there are men's rooms that are off limits; yes, there are simplistic views of racism by white New Yorkers. But what I got was a realistic presentation of an evolving friendship. Shirley is abrasive and self-centered; Lip is clueless most of the time. And I believed in them. See this film.",/

2,26 June 2020,Instant_Palmer,9, Ranks #5 on my IMDb Top 25 Best Buddy Films List. A Feel Good Movie at its Core,"Ignore the sour grapes criticism from Spike Lee. This was THE best film of 2018, and one of the best-ever feel-good buddy/road films. There is something very sincere about this film - it is understated in its messaging, and keeps the focus on the evolving bond and respect that grows between two polar opposite personalities. A well-made film, with first-rate acting, that makes you feel this good without feeling ""manipulated"", is a rare treat indeed. Highly recommended.",e
3,25 November 2018,taylor_king-890-815491,10," ""Green Book"" is Gold","We loved Green Book along with the sold-out crowd who applauded loudly at the end. Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is the
movie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. Top all this off with a really good soundtrack, excellent direction and production values, and an audience that laughed out loud and vigorously applauded at the end...this one is a true 10!",v

5,5 March 2019,classicsoncall,9," ""It takes courage to change people's hearts.""","In an awards season that offered five Best Picture nominations based on real life stories, that might have been a record in itself. Having seen them all, I think the Academy probably got it right this year in celebrating ""Green Book"" as it's big winner. It does tend to be formulaic in it's treatment of a white racist working for a black professional musician, who by their association come to understand a little bit about each other and form a bond that survives their two month road trip. But the relationship between Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is never sugar coated. The dialog between the two men is unusually grating most of the time to be funny, though there are moments of humor that break through. It's hard to imagine how this association came to be in the first place, as the two men are so diametrically opposed in temperament, style and erudition. But underlying Tony's acceptance of a job offer came a profound sense of honor and loyalty to his employer, one that couldn't be shaken by mob acquaintances, dirty cops, or genteel elite who profess surface politeness while refusing service to a member of the black race. What particularly struck me was how the only time Dr. Shirley looked really happy was when he played at the Orange Bird saloon in the Deep South, casting aside his refined demeanor to really play his heart out for an audience that responded so enthusiastically. What the two men learn about each is directly at the heart of the story, one which transcends race, religion and background in an effort to understand what makes people similar rather than the differences that keep them apart.",e
6,26 February 2019,BassLightyear,7, A review as a respons to other (negative) reviews.,"I understand why a lot of critics don't like this film, but at the same time I feel like they're making up their minds about what they think the movie is - or should - be about. They (who disagree with the film) will say that it diminishes the horrors that the black community faced in America during the 50's - and because of that they think it's a bad film. But I thought it was a good film; in my opinion it's not a movie about Shirley and his struggles facing ruthless racism - it's about Tony Lip's psychologically reforming journey changing his mind about black people through the witnessing of Shirley's experiences. And it's that central story line the critics are disagreeing with and eschews the whole film on the premiss that it should've been about something else (Shirley journey - not Tony's).",w
7,10 December 2019,TheLittleSongbird,8, A re-awakening journey,"My main reason for watching 'Green Book' was due to me wanting to see as many 2018 films as possible, and that it had won the Best Picture Oscar (so naturally wanted to see too that it was that good). Like Viggo Mortensen as an actor, the film's concept was appealing and it looked appetising. Word of mouth, including from very trusted friends online and in real life, was very positive so there were plenty of other reasons too.",/
8,22 September 2018,Art Snob,9, Critic-proof festival hit should be big holiday winner,"Some of my movie friends were stunned when I mentioned in a thread that this was my ""People's Choice Award"" vote for TIFF 2018 (it won, btw). I generally go for weightier fare, so my being won over by a PG-13 road film with the familiar ""they-couldn't-have-been-more-different"" premise directed by the auteur co-responsible for such recent classics as ""Dumb and Dumber To"" and ""The Three Stooges"" elicited a virtual double-take.",r
9,23 February 2019,AlsExGal,7, Not to say it isn't a decent movie...,"... just that it's so inoffensive, safe, and cliche that I feel like I've seen it a million times before. Mortensen and Ali are terrific actors, and I am thankful for them. Without their charisma (and Viggo's willingness to shove insane amounts of food down his throat), I fear Green Book would be dead on arrival.",w
10,26 December 2018,martindonovanitaly,8, Are We There Yet?,A journey of reawakening in a Country like ours - Gore Vidal called it the United States Of Amnesia - the absurdity of the behavior in the Southern communities even the kindest ones have a jarring effect. Viggo Mortensen is sheer perfection as the all American Italian. The opening of his heart and of his mind is a total joy and Mahershala Ali provides another magnetic character to his already rich list of magnetic characters but what makes this film fly so high is the humanity that Mortensen and Ali infuse their characters with. I loved them and Green Book provided me with one of the most satisfying endings of 2018. It leaves you with the hopeful thought that perhaps we're not there yet but that we are on our way. Happy New Year!,4
11,26 November 2018,rphshell,10," Finally...Well-written, well-acted Movie","This picture should be up for BEST PICTURE. It has everything: great acting, solid script-writing (something that Hollywood really needs), and lots of humor. I wish that Hollywood would make more pictures like this.",7
12,18 September 2018,Lotus-3,9, Greatful to have seen this,"I saw this at the premier at TIFF and was thrilled to learn the story is about a real friendship. This is not a typical road movie, or buddy film. Given the lead actors, I knew it would be something special, and it is. 
 Entertaining, funny in parts, hard to accept in others - as a white american who wasn't around in the 1960's, the racism was mind boggling and I couldn't help but feel shame. 
 Green Book has so many layers - family, culture, honesty, dignity, genius, respect, acceptance, stereotypes, racism, music, class, friendship, and fried chicken.
Whatever your views, race, or age - this film is not 'preachy', but you should appreciate an honest portrayal of a difficult time & place in history. 
I'll use the term an ""unlikely friendship"", but knowing the two men were real makes it fantastic. I'm so grateful to have learned about them and their lives.
I only wish there had been a Q&A afterward.",2

15,20 January 2020,perica-43151,9, Very authentic,"This is a nice movie with a very authentic story behind it. Both lives of the genius composer-musician, and his once driver tough-Italian guy, who ended up acting in mafia movies and series from Godfather to Sopranos, together with his son who won 2 Oscars, are very interesting, and the story has its authenticity to stand as its greatest strength. This is how it was in the 60s. Well acted it gives a piece of that atmosphere, it is not the most stylistically innovative movie, but it is not the point. The story, which comes-off initially as anti-Italian, wins you over slowly by its charm, and the fact that it was written by Italian son of one of the protagonists, reveals that it is sincere and gently self-mocking, but with the heart in the right place, exactly like the unlikely duo - not perfect, but entirely and heartwarmingly human. In the writing since the 80s, it gives 0 fs about the PC hyst eria, and can in fact teach our dear ment ally deficient woke friends what is the true face of disc rimination and how the real life heroes of the 60s, that they would in their stup ididty surely despise, in fact look like.",1

18,15 January 2019,MOscarbradley,9, A good old-fashioned feel-good movie,"If ""Green Book"" does win the Oscar for Best Picture, as some people think it might, then I for one won't complain. There are, of course, better pictures, (""Roma"" and ""The Favourite"" to name two), but this extremely well-made, nicely directed, intelligently scripted, (if at times a little too obvious in its heart-tugging sentimentality), and very well acted movie ticks all the boxes. It's a feelgood film of the old-fashioned kind that can look back at the bad old days of segregation rather smugly from its 21st Century perspective without feeling particularly smug.",?
19,30 December 2018,Fella_shibby,10," The film, Mortensen n Ali, they all deserve an Oscar.","This film is about the real-life friendship formed between an African American n an Italian bouncer during a road trip thru the Jim Crow South n the Sundown towns during the racial segregation period.
Mortensen was convincing as the family-devoted, street-smart bouncer with a fat belly. By the way his appetite was awesome.
Ali convincingly portrayed the loneliness n his eyes subtly channelized emotions of sadness.
The film dealt with many issues without being preachy.
Apart from the film's important message, the acting by the leads r top notch.
Mortensen n Ali shud be given Oscars for their performances.
One of the best part is the ending which takes place on a Christmas meal.",r
20,12 October 2018,theojhyman,9," Fantastic film, another music themed Oscar nominee","Just caught this as the surprise film of the London Film Festival. Such a well written drama with heart, soul and comedic touches, brilliantly performed by the two main actors, and given such an authentic 1962 shiny look to the film by the production designer and cinematographer.
A truly great true story with themes that all audiences can connect with - namely, music, family, race, sexuality, friendship and love - and Viggo Mortensen probably gives the performance of a lifetime. Will surely rival A Star is Born at the Oscars in many of the same categories.",e
21,15 January 2019,MarteParte,9, Respect demands respect,"A very inspiring film. I walked out of the cinema feeling like there is good even in the unlikeliest of people.
The dialogue was well written, and the main characters were equally as loveable. Viggo Mortensens acting was only overshadowed by that of Mahershala Ali, whose portrayal of an educated african-american man living in 1960's america was both heartwrenching and absolutely hilarious.
While Mortensen stood for most of the comic relief, I found myself laughing the hardest from Ali's deadpan deliveries through the character of Dr. Shirley.",f
22,26 December 2018,ColoDrz,10, Simply wonderful in its portrayal of humanity,"Green Book is a wonderful story of overcoming self-condemnation, and the resulting freedom it provides. As the film begins, Tony is locked in a prison of judgment and rejection, not from any conscious effort on his own but rather his circumstances and environment. As the self-assured and self-aware character of Dr. Shirley is introduced into Tony's life, Tony embarks on a journey of self-discovery in which he is forced to confront his own preconceived notions which ultimately stem from his skewed view of himself. As Dr. Shirley helps Tony to see himself as a man beyond his own limiting thoughts, Tony is finally able to step into his true nature as friend to Dr. Shirley.
Everywhere in this film we are reminded that people are complicated, but beyond these complications we are also reminded that everyone is the same, just looking for love and acceptance. The scene where Dolores reads Tony's letter to her cousins is spectacular in this regard. It's interesting that none of the other reviews mention the YMCA scene and aftermath, which for me was the pinnacle moment that the power shifted for these two characters confronting their own strengths and weaknesses.
This film is simply wonderful in its portrayal of humanity, and the people we need in our lives. While it comes to light that Tony's wife Dolores is completely aware of her husband's imperfections and shortcomings, she loves him just the same. But it is confrontation, not love, that is necessary to bring about Tony's redemption, demonstrating that the people who spur us to deep, personal growth are never who or what we expect.",_
23,5 December 2018,hiphopphotos,10, True Stories For Your Soul,"One of the reasons why I love this movie is simply because we are soooo much more. We as ""Black"" people have rich, intriguing, moving, and funny stories-I hate that we are sitting around waiting for the Next Great Director make movies in which the narratives do more than entertain. I hope Tyler Perry would be one of those innovative directors, but now I don't care who tells it-as long as it gets told. Thank you to the writer and director for such a moving movie that touches more than my funny bone.",=
24,31 January 2019,tavm,9, Green Book was one of the best films of last year!,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. This was the true story of Tony Lip (Vallelonga) and his working relationship as the chauffer and associate of pianist Dr. Don Shirley during the early '60s as they travel throughout much of the South for the pianist's concert engagements. It's quite a touching and occasionally funny story co-written by Tony's son Nick. Nice surprise to hear it was mostly shot in Louisiana, where I live, even during a snow scene when it actually snowed in my state during December of '17! My friend and I really liked this one so that's a high recommendation!",t
25,2 January 2019,billcr12,9, Best Movie of the Year,"Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are perfectly cast as a pair of people from other worlds. Mortensen is Tony the lip, a bouncer/driver who works the Copacabana in 1962 when the club is closed for renovations. He is hired by pianist Don Shirley (Ali) and it is off to the road for a concert tour. The north is is no problem but the south becomes a nightmare of racism for both men. The story is a beautiful one of discovery for the pair. The script is funny and tragic and Farrelly does a great directing job of the two stars. This is my pick for best picture at the Oscars and Mortensen for best actor. Please see this great film",t

27,29 November 2018,brianjohnson-20043,10, I give it 👍👍. The negative reviews are full of it,"I honestly don't understand why so many critics don't like this film as much as the audience. Green Book has a great artistic story, a good script, great acting, it has some great humor, some great drama and poigniance. It's well directed. It has both characters learn from one another and need one another despite often not being able to stand one another. It doesn't show such developments in a preachy kind of way. It doesn't seem to present any silly inconceivable blunders. I felt it was well worth spending 2 hours watching in a theater, and I found it one of the best films I've seen this year. If not the very best.",u
28,10 December 2018,zkonedog,10, A Little Bit Of Everything,"One of my favorite cinematic experiences is when a film comes absolutely out of nowhere and ends up being incredible. That is pretty much the story of ""Green Book"", a movie that came into the 2018 holiday season with little hype but, when all is said and done, might be the frontrunner for ""best film of the year"" on many personal lists. It sure is on mine, I can tell you that!",r
29,24 November 2018,mhope-91601,10, Best example of the power of cinema,"Who could've ever greenlit ""Green Book""? A (mostly) true story of two men of completely different backgrounds overcoming their own prejudices and the stifling racism of the Deep South of the early 1960s. We'll hire a Danish guy to play an Italian guy, and a guy best known for playing a political fixer and a dope dealer (in ""House of Cards"" and ""Moonlight"", respectively) to play a Jamaican-American musical genius. And we'll have one of the Farrelly brothers direct it. How could that possibly become a great movie? Well, it does- primarily through the great performances of Viggo Jorgensen and Mahershala Ali, and the nuanced directing of Peter Farrelly. It confronts the racism prevalent at the time without becoming preachy, and shows its main characters growing through contact with each other, without a complete reversal of their characters (which would've seemed phony). Oh, and the movie looks great, too- the period cars, sets, and costumes really take you back to that time period. A film festival favorite, ""Green Book"" will hopefully be appreciated by Oscar voters, too.",v

Green Book shows the academy taking the step in the right direction in picking a movie that the average person will actually enjoy. Green Book is simply a good movie. Both leads act well, the story is moving and interesting, and it gives social message (condemning racism) without being preachy or ramming it down the viewer's throat.",

It was also hard to ignore that Peter Farrelly along with his brother, is normally known for bringing often crude comedy films.

47,25 February 2019,Tweetienator,7, Plays in the Safe Zone,"Most of the reviewers here state how important the message of the movie is. I will play the advocatus diaboli here: I don't care about the message of a movie without entertainment - in the first place by watching a movie I want to be entertained and not educated. Green Book is that kind of movie that you make in our times if you want the applause of today's Hollywood's crowd (remember Shape of the Water!?) - add some known actors, some production value and you can grab easy some prices and positive reception here and there. 2nd choice: make something about saving nature. Creativity!? Daring!? Uniqueness!? None. Anyway, the message of course is one already told many times before (e.g. The Intouchables, Driving Miss Daisy to name some obvious ones), but I admit the actors and their chemistry work well - and that's the real strong part here: the acting of Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. No doubt, Green Book for sure has its strong moments, but in a certain sense it is a little too predictable for my taste, or one could say, to save played. Movies like In the Heat of the Night or 12 Years a Slave made a stronger and more lasting impression on me - both movies I watched a couple of times. Will I put Green Book again one time on my plate - maybe. Verdict: solid to good.",

49,8 March 2019,Benjamin-M-Weilert,10, An instant classic that everyone should see at least once.,"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that has the right balance of themes and execution to make it into an instant classic. When I first saw trailers for Green Book (2018), I initially thought it was just going to be an inverse of Driving Miss Daisy (1989). Instead, what I got was so much more than that. Green Book tackles the difficult task of presenting a harsh mirror on our past, with a knowing wink that some of these challenges are still present today. It is more subtle than BlacKkKlansman (2018), but the message still gets across in a heartwarming and wholesome way.",

All the nominees are well deserved to win the award.",
51,8 December 2018,statuskuo,9, Best Movie Of The Year,"This movie gives no apologies for being schmaltzy. And I love it for that. It's classical storytelling ala ""Driving Miss Daisy"" in reverse. And color change.
Mahershala Ali is brilliant as piano prodigy Don Shirley, who needs someone to drive him on a tour through the deep South. Enter jamoke Tony Lipp. A newly unemployed bouncer whose brawn is worst than his bite played by Viggo Mortensen. Let's be honest, NOTHING is unexpected her if you've watched brotherly love movies from the past 30 years, or road movies for that matter like say...""Rain Man"" the resolution is exactly what you think. But...so what? It's beautiful and touching and gets you in the right spot. And I love director Peter Farrelly for it. The problem with today's movies is that it believes being mean and criticizing ALL bigots means they have to be bumbling morons. Whilst true, there are also bigots with families who have good hearts or similar ignorance. That is the dynamics of depth. Obviously, the stakes aren't necessarily Civil Rights. It touches on it, but never pushes you into eye roll territory. Though presently criticized as softening the racism with humor, what is telling is that they paint Shirley's character as the world intelligent educated gifted Black man with talent and Viggo as coming to terms with others who are MUCH more bigoted as he. This illustrates the divide of class as much as race.
The tone is of joy and friendship and understanding. And though I think it's too simple to say it's begging for peace in a tumultuous era in America (it really isn't) it still is a fun road movie. More laughs than anything. Well crafted story of grown men finding ways to grow up.",

53,12 January 2019,jackgdemoss,9, No rising and falling action. Just captivative excellence all the way thorugh.,"I haven't seen a film like Green Book in quite some time. A film that doesn't have long-winded exposition followed by a dramatic resolution, but that is still satisfying the entire way through. I liken it to Forrest Gump in the sense that the captivation does not come from a place of waiting to see what comes next, but rather, it comes from being in that moment with the characters. Viggo Mortensen's performance was astonishing as a firmly rooted New Yorker. It certainly helped that Director Peter Farrelly pulled me into the 60s about thirty seconds into the opening scene.

In Peter Farrelly's (""Dumb and Dumber To"") warm and human comedy/drama Green Book, Shirley undertakes the journey together with Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Moretnsen, ""Captain Fantastic""), a night club bouncer who is known to his Italian mob pals in the Bronx as Tony ""Lip.""

This is heavy handed populism, shallow and self-righteously preaching, reducing a complex social struggle to simple stereotypes.

Mahershala Ali is phenomenal with his nuanced & sensitive portrayal of a great virtuoso & a sophisticated man of refined tastes. Viggo Mortensen inhabited his role so completely that it's difficult to believe that he's not an Italian!

It focuses more on the core friendship than anything else, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, and Mortensen and Ali have great chemistry which really gives the film its entertainment value. Unfortunately, though, it takes a long while for the main conceit to really get going and this first portion of the flick is almost devoid of any real entertainment value. Luckily though, once things get on the road it becomes a fairly entertaining time and moves along briskly - although the skit-based comedy that makes up for most it (which, again, feels outdated in a picture like this) becomes quite tiresome. Overall, it's sufficiently entertaining throughout - thanks largely to Mortensen and Ali - and moves briskly enough. It's let down by its outdated filmmaking and narrative conceit, though, and by its lack of depth, too. 6/10",

As opposed to the infamous failure to nominate a racially more challenging and sophisticated picture such as ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989) for Best Picture the year ""Driving Miss Daisy"" won it, this time, they gave Spike Lee an Oscar, too, for ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018), a film that I think has its own faults, but, at least, it's not simply a message picture of ""racism is bad, but look how far we've come"" for the dumb and dumber.

The emotions between the two main characters here came across as forced and inauthentic. Why choose the Danish-American Viggo Mortensen to play an Italian-American from the Bronx? His portrait was an amateurish embarrassment. Almost grotesque, but supposed to get laughs. And Ali's character, Don Shirley, does things down South that would most likely get him killed---I doubt the incidents in the movie truthfully matched the real-life happenings. It looked like a movie about Americans that was made by Canadians. Full of false notes, with no real flavor.
This movie wasn't even a crowd-pleaser where I saw it (NYC). Don't expect Tony to beat-up every racist we see, Buford Pusser style.

He became an ordinary working class Italian-American guy, I felt he is a member of the Sopranos' family... Mahershala Ali has a mighty presence, as always.

Their very different demeanors, lifestyles and skill sets are a shock to each other but they do their best to learn from each other and meet in the middle so they can both be successful with their responsibilities. This movie is directed by Peter Farrelly (Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin) and stars Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings), Mahershala Ali (Luke Cage) and Linda Cardellini (Brokeback Mountain). The storyline for this is very intricate and brilliantly written. The subplots on the Italian, the world renowned pianist and how those individuals were perceived through various interactions in the south were fascinating and well presented.

The film was inspired by true events that year when Don Shirley toured the Deep South accompanied by Frank Vallelonga. Shirley was a black classical pianist and Vallelonga, known as ""Tony Lip,"" was an out of work white bouncer from New York's Copacabana Night Club. In true order of content, this film is first a drama, then biography, and then comedy. It's a film about prejudice, family, racism, class distinction, success, opportunity, and the social constrictions of the period.",

129,27 February 2022,arthur_tafero,7, A Classic Film for the Ages - The Green Book,"This film is beautifully written and directed, and the performances of the two leading actors is impeccable. The movie richly deserved to be the Best Film of the Year at the Oscars. As far as I am concerned, it is one of the best films of all time with the issues of race relations. The movie does not hit you over the head in the vast majority of scenes, but is subtle and pervasive in its delivery of the agonies suffered by blacks in the early 60s in the United States. Tony Lip is not a stereotype, but a fair representation of a typical working-class Italian in the Bronx in the early 60s. And Dr. Shirley is anything but a stereotype of the black experience for that time period. I found the most profound scene in the film to be when the two had car trouble next to a field of black laborers, who only marveled at the sight of a black man being catered to by a white man. The Green Book was a directory of places to stay in the South for blacks before the Civil Rights Act became an accepted reality. Just the existence of such a book is obviously a travesty of our Constitution and the realities surrounding the South in the early 60s. I remember, quite vividly, hearing stories of my favorite baseball team, the New York Yankees, having to make separate accommodations for Elston Howard, the first black player on the Yankees in the 1950s, and even into the 1960s (Another film perhaps?). I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to get an inkling of the Black Experience in America.",

Not every film has to be a harrowing depiction of segregation where characters are brutally harmed. Much like in Farrelly's case here, a lighter approach can still produce the same intentions and profound awareness without detracting from the main story itself. That is why I believe Green Book is a resounding success. The racial discrimination is an environmental factor that brings these two opposing personalities closer together, focusing on a story about friendship.

Unlikely director Peter Farrelly surprises all in a turn of displaying his dramatic goods (sprinkled with enough humor to keep things even-keeled) with ample help from his two leads parrying and giving good with one another.

Not only has the output of movies been great, but it also seems that the Academy heads this year have made a sensible selection; this movie having been included in the category for best film of the year. Academy accolades aside, this a truly remarkable film, especially coming from a director, Peter Farelly, who, so far, has specialised in the comedy genre.
This is a huge departure from his previous body of work and it shows that, given the right script and the right assemble of actors, he can be a huge game changer when it comes to telling heartwarming stories about flawed, but ultimately, good-hearted characters. Beautifully shot ( the production design is especially remarkable) , written and acted ( Viggo Mortensen surprises once again in one of his most nuanced performances to date and Marhershala Ali delivers another strong performance, in what it's turning out to be an outstanding acting career), this is truly one of the best movies l've seen this year, and unlike so many others Oscar winning movies, one that is destined to live long in the memory of its audience.

165,14 December 2018,matthewssilverhammer,8, More Than Just a Modern Driving Miss Daisy,"Green Book is a movie outside of its time: an adult, Christmas centric, character-driven drama with as much naturalist humor as compelling humanity. Yet despite the trailer's maudlin tone and the familiar racial themes, it's more than just a bad Driving Miss Daisy knockoff. Sure, it dabbles in some of the worst parts of ""let's-make-white-Americans-feel-okay-about-their-own-racist-past"" storytelling like the white savior and the magical black man clichés, but it just as often finds time to upend and reverse those very things. Instead of forced and frustrating sentimentality, it's a charming and lovely true story that doesn't sacrifice honest humanity for easy emotions.
The unlikely real friendship of roughneck Italian driver Tony Lip (Mortensen) and acclaimed black pianist Don Shirley (Ali) is refreshingly rare, a biopic that isn't already widely known. It's an episodic roadtrip film that axles itself around the theme of love breaking down stereotypes. The two central performances are the best of what we expect from an Oscar-season tearjerker: big and hammy, but fully engaging and undeniably committed. Ali is solidly stoic, uniquely positioned (""Oh, so knowing who Little Richard is makes you more black than I am?!""), and highly impressive behind the piano; while Mortensen is phenomenally brash, insecure, and downright funny (""'Virtuoso'...it's Italian...means he's, uh...really good."") in a physically unrecognizable turn.
Now, I don't want to pretend this is some sort of big force of cinematic brilliance. The writing is often on-the-nose and the direction regularly pushes its messaging with a heavy hand. Still, it never hurts to be reminded of the stupidity of ignorance. Green Book does just that; perfectly moving, engagingly funny, and maybe the best Christmas movie since Elf.",

Throw in cultural differences, class clashes, homophobia, it's a melting pot of issues. Sometimes played for laughs with the racism matter of fact, sometimes not, with blood drawn. Prejudices take many forms. The balm that eases tensions, teaches respect... music. As Viggo Mortensen's character says ""It's a complicated world"", but watching him and Mahershala Ali, learn from each other as they travel the deep south really is pretty wonderful.

That makes it even more fascinating that one of them, Peter Farrelly is now directing a ""dramedy"" about race relations and friendship. The jarring shift in tone relates to the fact that the pair had been having trouble finding that same comedic fire from before.

188,15 March 2020,jamiedarlow-37510,10, Extremely engaging and charming yet tough,"Set in the 1960s, Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) an Italian-American bouncer is hired to be the driver for Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali) an African-American musician who is going on tour through the American Deep South. What entails is a deeply complex and honest study of the relationship between these two characters and that is the absolute heart and soul of the film. The two central performances are outstandingly good; Mortensen continues to impress and creates a very comic yet grounded in reality character in Tony here; a family man who is proud to provide, loves them very dearly, just above as much as he loves food! He really packed on the pounds for this one; good for him! He was insanely funny at various points throughout the film as well as being a reliable source of comfort for Dr Shirley in the confrontational scenes. His wife Dolores is played fantastically by Linda Cardellini! Ali is really amazing in the role of Shirley too; a very well spoken and dignified man who just asks for a very simple thing from fellow human beings; respect. He is the emotional undercurrent of the film and helps to bring that emotion out through Tony also. Of course this is set during a time of extreme prejudice and bigotry which creates the more tough to watch and infuriating scenes in the film; all of Shirley's loneliness and pain is caused by people mistreating him just for the colour of his skin. It's unbelievable to even imagine that these grim events occurred in human history and it is highlighted here and exposed for the true crime it really was. Unfortunately, we still see this sort of behaviour today even if it's in milder forms and we can only hope for a time when any discrimination just goes away. It's a film that knows to take its subject matter seriously as it should be but also manages to be comedic aswell as the interaction between Tony and Shirley for the most part is very funny while managing to be profoundly moving. I could talk for longer but in summary! I think it's a masterpiece",

He got poison in his system,"" the black man explains to his Machiavellian host, as being the reason for the white man's anemic condition. Cullen(Sidney Poitier) and ""Joker""(Tony Curtis), once warring fugitives on the run, to both men's surprise, are still chained to each other, even after the woman, an unconditional racist(Cara Williams), unshackles their wrists. It matters to both of them, if the other one lives or dies. John's concern for Cullen is beyond the woman's comprehension.""What did I do wrong? the single mother asks, when John finds out that the directions she gave Cullen is a death trap. Nothing but bogs and quicksand; nothing to be concerned about, because a black man is nothing. ""Why do you get so excited about that 'Negro' for?"" she screams. It's the late-fifties. The incident involving those three civil rights workers who went missing in Neshoba County was still a little ways off. For now, it's Mississippi simmering. But what was the audience thinking; these average everyday people from an era who internalized institutional racism like breathing? This mutual respect, this male bonding of disparates, welded together by altruistic materials, to a large degree, must have estranged them. Even to the most progressive-minded moviegoer, down deep inside, there existed a latent feeling of repulsion, a self-awareness they would never own up to having. These proto-liberals may have loved jazz, Jackie Robinson, and the idea of civil rights, but when put to the test, in life, or being a voyeur in the dark observing an imitation of life, they recoiled at the idea of a white man choosing friendship(WITH A ""NEGRO""!) over romance(WITH A WOMAN!). Before the sea change in 1964, the year that gave black people the right to vote, the spectacle of a black man in a white woman's house, chained, and then, shockingly unchained, was new to film language. The grandparents sitting in these movie palaces, lest not we forget, saw D.W. Griffith's ""The Birth of a Nation"" as small children. They remember Gus pursuing Flora on the mountain. Gus was up to no good; he had only one thing on his mind. It was rhetoric. It was propaganda. It worked. They remember Flora jumping off the mountain. They blamed Gus for the suicide. Cullen, in their estimation, should sleep outside, not on the couch. But they know, however, that mother and son have no choice; they don't begrudge the woman's need to compromise. The small family is counting on ""Joker"" to get them out of this one-horse town. The boy's mother listens to Cullen. John needs a bed. It must be something he ate. Their last meal, frog, roasted over an open fire, is the likely culprit for his indisposed condition. Made in 1958, Stanley Kramer's ""The Defiant Ones"" should be one for the time capsule. But, alas, ""time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin', into the future.""",

203,13 May 2019,patriciogl10,8, Beautiful depiction of human bond.,"When I first found out about this film I was hyped, mainly because of the pairing of Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen. I mean, they are both such fantastic actors and come from very different filmic backgrounds so I was definitely interested. Also what caught my attention was Peter Farrelly's shift towards a drama picture. The fact that it involved a character being a classical pianist was a plus. It seemed like a recipe for a perfect film, yet it lacked some ingredients. I actually liked the fact that the racism came from a different place, it had different shades to it. Most of Dr. Don Shirley's audience were of upper class, people with refined tastes such as opera, art and classical music. So naturally, they highly respected him but nevertheless discriminated him because of the colour of his skin. That subtle treatment was done to a great extent in my opinion, rather than
showing merciless violence. Because it reminds us that racism can come in different, more fine-drawn ways that are still quite offensive because of its subtlety, and sometimes non-direct fashion. A lot of people feel that racism was treated quite lightly, to which I believe it was necessary to succesfully capture different nuances of the situation I stated earlier, regarding Dr. Shirley's profession and his target audience.",

Tony Lip is an Italian American who sticks to his own people but he needs this job. The job is to drive Don around on a road tour down to the deep south for concerts. It is set in 1962 based on a true story where race relations was it its height. The characters at first don't get on very well they have tackle the racial issues in the south. But they really grow a relationship with each other to try and get over prejudices. Ali is a magnificent actor he proved it when he won the Oscar for Moonlight in 2016 and he proves it again here. Viggo is also brilliant and his perfectly cast for this role. The film was written by Tony Lip's son and you can see the affection the screenplay has for these two real life characters.

210,10 November 2018,emailtombuchanan,9, A wonderful Film Guarenteed to Build Empathy,"I just enjoyed a preview screening of ""Green Book,"" a heartwarming family film scheduled to release over the Thanksgiving holiday. Green Book is based on a true story about a black concert pianist (played by Mahershala Ali) who tours the American Deep South in the early 1960's, and takes along a rough-and-tumble Italian bar bouncer as his driver/fixer (played by Viggo Mortensen). The driver begins the tour as a northern racist who takes the eight week assignment because he needs quick cash, while the pianist starts the tour as a lonely and pompous prick unable to fully navigate the white world where his music is highly valued, and equally uncomfortable in black-America. Through the film we see the two characters find each other and themselves as they subtly bond, and we feel the connection as a real friendship blossoms. The title of the film comes from a once essential tour book that listed hotels and other businesses willing to serve black customers, in an era when American blacks were legally equal to whites but discrimination remained grossly overt. I was fortunate to see Green Book at Dartmouth College in a packed 237 seat theater with an audience that responded well to the drama and humor, and to the empathy developing on-screen. Green Book is a well-crafted PG-13 film that pulled excellent reviews in festival showings, and tells an important story in a touching way. The film shines a light on an ugly part of American history, and offers hope that by connecting with diverse characters and lives we can overcome our divisions. It's a wonderful story that perfectly fits our present times, and it needs to be shared.",

Back in 1987 Alfred Uhry wrote a Pulitzer prize-winning play called Driving Miss Daisy, it was a fine play and, when subsequently adapted for the screen, an equally fine film. Set in Atlanta, Ga, it featured a Black man working as a chauffeur to a White Jewish lady. Green Book features a White Italian-American chauffeuring a Black man through the Deep South. Similar stories, right? Well, maybe. Miss Daisy actually lived in Atlanta while Dr Shirley was merely touring whilst playing a series of one-night concerts. Actually the film is about two disparate individuals, chalk and cheese, initially antagonistic who learn to respect, admire, and bond with each other - now that IS a new plot.

Based on the true story, in New York City, Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Viggo Mortensen) works as a bouncer at a nightclub, the place is closed down for renovations, so he seeks new employment. He is invited for an interview with Doctor ""Doc"" Don Shirley (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Mahershala Ali), a black pianist who had Tony suggested to him, he is looking for a driver for his eight-week concert tour through the Mid-West and Deep South. Based on the strength of his references, Don hires Tony, they embark with plans to return to New York on Christmas Eve. Don's record label gives Tony a copy of the Green Book, a guide for black travellers to find motels, restaurants, and filling stations that would serve black people. The tour begins in the Midwest before they eventually head further south. Don and Tony initially clash, with Tony uncomfortable being made to act refined, and Don being disgusted with Tony's habits. As the tour progresses, Tony is impressed with Don's talent on the piano, he also becomes increasingly appalled by the discriminatory treatment the musician receives from event hosts and the general public when he is not on stage. One night, Don's life is threatened by a group of white men in a bar, Tony rescues him and instructs Don he should not go anywhere without him for the rest of the tour. Before leaving, Tony's wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) desired him to write her letters, to let her know what he is up to, and express his feelings for her. Throughout the journey, Don helps Tony write letters to his wife, which deeply move her, while Tony encourages Don to get in touch with his own estranged brother, but Don is hesitant, observing that his professional life and achievements are stopping him. Don is caught in a gay encounter with a white man, Tony bribes the officers to prevent the musician's arrest, which upsets Don, as he feels that he is ""rewarding"" them for their treatment. Later, Don and Tony are arrested after being pulled over by a police officer in an all-white town and Tony punches him after being insulted. While they are incarcerated, rather than using his call to contact his ""lawyer"", Don uses the opportunity to reach Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who orders the governor to release them. Tony is amazed by the experience, while Don is humiliated, this leads to an argument between them. Having reached his breaking point, Don tells Tony that his fame prevents him from identifying with people of his race, while his race prevents him from being accepted by white people, and his homosexuality from being accepted by anybody, making him feel truly lonely. The night of his final performance in Birmingham, Alabama, Don is refused entry into the whites-only dining room of the country club venue he is performing at. Tony threatens the owner, and Don refuses to play, so Tony takes Don to dinner at a predominantly black blues club, listed in the Green Book, where Don plays on the stage piano and rouses the crowd with his music. Tony and Don head back north to try to make it home by Christmas Eve, Tony gets tired during a snowstorm, so Don takes over driving duty, and they make it in time for Tony's family dinner. Don later returns to Tony's apartment, Tony invites him in, there is a brief silence from everyone, but he is welcomes and thanked by Tony's wife for helping him write his letters. Also starring Don Stark as Jules Podell, Sebastian Maniscalco as Johnny Venere, Dimiter D. Marinov as Oleg and Mike Hatton as George. Mortensen is likeable as the amusing Italian-American rough diamond who slowly has his attitudes changed, but not his manners, but Ali almost steals the show as the talented African-American pianist who struggles during the time of segregation and has standards, together Mortensen and Ali are a wonderful odd-couple on the road. The style of the story is very similar to Driving Miss Daisy, with the chauffeur forming an unlikely friendship with his passenger, the scenes of piano playing and concerts are also likeable, this film really makes you realise the severe nature of the treatment of black people during the 1960s, but it leaves enough room to make you laugh and have well-meaning and touching scenes, it all adds up to a satisfying crowd-pleasing biographical drama. It won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Best Film Editing, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film and Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay and Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.

In particular a certain scene with fried chicken is going to act like a Rorschach test for the audience. The troublesome nature of the material is important to acknowledge. Ultimately, through, given the light touch of the direction, the screenplay's nuance I think this story is about as un-troublesome as a film with this plot can be. These myths are harmful because they are so common. There is no reason to single out a single token of them, especially when the material is handled so deftly.",

238,3 February 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,5, By the book.,"'Green Book (2018)' is supposed to be this heart-warming, 'feel-good' type of film but it doesn't really come across that way. You can tell that's its intention, though, and, indeed, it's perhaps the only angle from which the piece is at least somewhat successful. There's an undeniable chemistry between its two leads and their banter provides intermittent entertainment, but I wouldn't say it comes close to being emotionally impactful. Their friendship isn't all that convincing mainly because it develops rather quickly and because neither of them are fully rounded characters. It has some deeper issues, too. Not only is its message incredibly simple, and arguably somewhat retrograde, but it's also impeached in a number of scenes. During these, the flick makes decisions that are questionable at best and incompetent at worst. Of course, there is a rather genuine debate surrounding the validity of crowd-pleasing, consumer-friendly work that tackles serious themes. This piece, however, feels basic in terms of what it tries to achieve and how it goes about doing it. I wouldn't even say it's all that successful at it. Even on face-value, the film feels old-fashioned and oddly paced. Still, I won't disregard its occasional enjoyable moments. It's not awful, by any means. It's just that when you compare it to thematically-similar - and awards-competing - work like 'BlacKkKlansman (2018)', you start to see where it falls short. To be honest, it's not really what we need right now. 5/10",
239,24 January 2019,GabrielSymes,10, Really nice film,"I kind of went into this thinking the issue of racism would dominate and there wold be a lot of those ""important"" messages. It doesn't. The film is about how friendship can transgress boundaries of race, colour, ethnicity. It reminds me a lot of the stories on how the British got Ian Paisley to talk to Martin McGuinness at the height of the troubles in Ireland and their animosity to one another. They made them share the same car. The Green Book is a similar journey and along the way says something important. That we are social beings and a lot of the differences we see between us are contrived and of lessor importance. Watch out for the scene where they argue about who is more black.",

244,2 February 2019,El-Ak,8, One of the most intelligent films I have ever seen with very affecting performances.,"The movie is really fantastic with Viggo and Mahershala giving a very simple excellent performance with me loving Viggo more. The story is superb along with the screenplay of the characters which was very terrific with some awesome quotes that can go on forever.
The best thing I like about the story that it didn't have to be R rated to show racism and give us much violence to describe it. It only showed this with absolutely no loud voice or profanity or anything more than
looks and very simple situation, for me the whole movie is excellent in it's impossible simple way of telling the story with the simple performances that lacked the presence of better music that would have made the scenes a lot more better. Also the whole Green Book matter in the film wasn't clear for me even when it was opened and couldn't understand it's presence that much more than that it's because it's the movie's title!. Also hopped that it didn't get to the sexuality and that kinda stuff which sometimes is not necessary in the movies especially this one and only to attract some audiences which I am totally against. Viggo's character will be me favorite for a long while and for me he was even better than Rami's performance at Bohemian Rhapsody. Mahershala deserve the Oscar that he will win for that strong expressions and emotions although he and Viggo had some entertaining master acting scenes comedy and drama.
In the end, one of all time favorite films and don't miss a chance to see that film 8.5/10",

The movie is entertaining, music is enjoyable, and overall it will make you feel good. It does not portray New York Italians as very bright, which is not really fair, but does show a friendship can develop between people from different backgrounds regardless of their ethnicity. Of course a good part of the movie shows how bad it was in the south with Jim Crow in effect, and rightly so, but I was happy the movie did not make that the only focus like the movie Mudbound (a depressing movie). This movie is well worth your time to see, and both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were superb in their respective roles.",

Green Book falls into a similar category to an extent, but it attempts to be a little more than it may have earned. The crux of Green Book is the bond and chemistry between Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) and Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali), and in this vein, it succeeds immensely. It's their back and forth that proves to be a powerful viewing experience in the theater. However, what the film tries to save about race, sexuality, & class feels very surface level and cliched. It works consistently but not to the point that other films have in recent years about similar subject matters. And perhaps it's not trying to be anything more than a crowd pleasing movie about friendships and criticisms like mine won't seem fair, but if it's going to be considered for best picture, then it should be brought up. In the end, it's about how everyone in the world has something to learn from somebody, no matter race, gender, nationality, or sexual preference.",

Tony Lip character was portrayed as a generic sicilian goombah wiseguy. Dr. Donald Shirley was portrayed as a stuck up, arrogant douche with contempt for ordinary people. I couldn't find neither one of these characters interesting or likeable. They should have worked a little bit harder developing Dr. Shirley's character without the aloof attitude. Dolores was the only likeable character played by the lovely Linda Cardellini. I wish she had more screen time. The terribly italian pronounced spoken lines made me cringe.

When Tony's wife Dolores acted by Linda Cardellini (a simple favor, Mad men) is told by Tony that his job offer is from a colored man, Dolores reacts very well in a manner only a wife who understands and knows her husband well does. Dolores enjoys all love letters written by Tony while he is away driving Doc from one southern state to another to keep up with concert schedule. The screenplay is terrific. Excellent acting.

265,25 November 2018,cultfilmfan,10, Peter Farrelly's Green Book,"I love it when filmmakers who are usually classified, or tend to stick within one genre, or type of film only and then they eventually break that cycle and area of familiarity and do something radically different. In recent years I have cited examples such as Adam McKay who got away from his Will Ferrell films to do The Big Short, and not only was it the best reviewed film of his career, but it also won him a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar. Something that most likely would not have happened if he had just stuck to his usual fare of manic if not sometimes annoying comedies. Also please take Todd Phillips who is also known for often raunchy teen oriented comedies such as The Hangover trilogy and others that pretty much fall into the same category. He branched out and tried a mix between comedy and drama in War Dogs, and whilst the film got mixed reviews generally, I would personally say that it was the best accomplishment of his career and further reaching out for new goals, he was also the producer of this year's version of A Star is Born which has been a big hit with audiences, critics and at the box office. Some say that it still has a very good chance to nab several Oscars, possibly even Best Picture. Now in this case with Green Book, we have writer/director Peter Farrelly who is again known for mostly doing gross out, or raunchy and immature comedies such as the Dumb and Dumber films and various others. I have liked some of his and his brother Bobby's work in the past, especially something like There's Something About Mary, but more often than not, their particular brand of humour was often far different than my own personal taste. This time around, Peter takes a true story and helps write the screenplay and directs, but here he chooses a film that has just as much if not more laughs than the films he would normally do, but also at the same time he gives the film a timely message of friendship and acceptance and I think anyone who is not deeply moved by the film on some level probably saw a different film than I did. It is full of rich humour and some of the best work from dependable actors Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. The film is all the more timely because as we all know the problem with racism in our world is still running rampant and how refreshing it is to see two men from completely different backgrounds and are more or less worlds apart from one another and how they form a bond and connection that will lead to a lasting friendship and a road trip across the Southern United States that I doubt either man would ever forget. Viggo's character is a bouncer in several nightclubs in the Bronx area of New York. He has a large appetite, uses coarse language on a regular basis and is a little rough around the edges and tends to have a habit of either winning people over with his schemes and dubious personality, or at the same time completely offending, or turning people off as in the case of Mahershala Ali's character. Ali's character is a concert pianist with many degrees and doctorates and is very well spoken and educated. He couldn't be more different than Viggo's character if he tried. And there is also the cultural differences such as Viggo's Italian background and Ali's character being of African American descent. This looks like it would be the worst possible match in history and yet Viggo drives Ali's character across the United States for about two months to get him to his various different concert performances. The two will occasionally bicker with more often than not, Ali's character being completely exasperated and often offended and turned off by Viggo's character's more street type talk and peronality. However, as time goes by the two do form a common bond with one another and actually start to become friends. As well as on several occasions while in the deep Southern states that Viggo will come to Ali's rescue and one humourous instance where Ali uses a powerful ally to bail them out of a tough spot. This is a film about putting any and all prejudices aside and seeing goodness within your fellow man and learning to appreciate that. This road trip truly shapes these two characters in marvellous ways and we see that deep down under a rough exterior that Viggo's character has a huge heart and that Ali deep down is dealing with loneliness and his own trials and tribulations, but is further helped by Viggo's friendship and way, or should I say lack of way with words and handling people. This is an absolutely wonderful film that made me laugh more than any other film this year and at the same time it warmed my heart and moved me and helped me to appreciate the racist attitudes of the 60's when the film takes place and again show how we still need to further move ahead as a society. The performances by the two leads are I think the two best male performances I have seen this year and the characters are so wonderfully vibrant and full of emotions, personality and life all thanks to a meticulously researched and well scripted story for our actors and characters.
A film of this type of quality does not come along too often, so I suggest you see it while you can and do not be surprised to see various Oscar nominations and even potential wins. One of the best films of this year.",

268,7 July 2020,adeckofcards,8, A friendship without borders,"'Green Book' is a film full of feelings and emotions. We start from the classic and widely used base already from a very different couple from which an unexpected friendship arises. In this case, between an African-American pianist and his Italian driver. The atmosphere generated by this relationship results in a film full of sentimentality and extremely funny situations. That is the strongest point of this tape.
However, just as it does the humorous part perfectly, the dramatic part is pretty weak. His representation of racism at that time is weak and very softened, with situations that do not fully frame the segregation that African Americans were forced to live. And when it tries to be dramatic, it exaggerates it, including situations to force the viewer's feeling.
However, outside of that it is a complete film, with a direct narrative and good performances. It tells the story without more or less, it does not risk anything, but it does not lose anything either, making it a film that can certainly please anyone, this being its greatest achievement in what it is offering.",
269,23 March 2022,elomholt,8, Green book,"The movie ""Green Book"" directed by Peter Farrelly follows the Italian ex-bouncer Tony Vallelonga and his experiences working as the driver for the African American classical pianist Don Shirley in 1962. With clashing beliefs and values, they drive around America for Shirley's concerts, and together, they witness the cruel injustice African Americans faced at the time. However, through these experiences, they find a profound respect for each other and develop a strong friendship. This movie brilliantly raises awareness of the racism African Americans faced in the 60s and makes you wonder how much has changed and how much still needs to change. Although segregation and blatant racism may not be as prevalent as in the 60s America, it is still a major issue faced around the world.

Viggo Mortensen is fantastic. There is no other word to describe his performance. I know he got a lot of backlash lately, mostly due to some comments he did. Anyway, his performance is undoubtedly fantastic. I mean look how versatile that actor is... this was Aragon! A very unlikely character he marvelously brought to life and delivered one of the absolute top performances of the year. Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali also did some magic with his role. Especially in the scenes when ""Doc"" lost his facade and showed his true emotions and struggle. Excellent work as well. The rest of the cast is servable but nothing too outstanding. The screenplay is surely very good. Peter Farrelly's direction better than with most of his comedic gigs. The film is entertaining and has an important story to tell.

So it surprises me a bit that with all the attention it racked up, this film ""only"" managed five Oscar nominations. Still, it may still be in second position for the Best Picture win (behind Roma) after its massive success at the Golden Globes. And it has Mahershala Ali pretty much safe winning his second Oscar (who'd have thought five years ago) while also being more than an underdog to add another for its screenplay. The man in charge there when it came to adapting this over 2-hour movie was Peter Farrelly and he is also the director. Among others, Farrelly got help with the script from Nick Vallelonga and if you paid only a bit attention during the movie, then you will recognize immediately the last name. Yep he is Tony Lip's son and it is pretty fitting that not just his father appeared in several mob-related movies that are deemed classics today.",
292,21 February 2019,zain-nov,6," With the noise it made recently, I could say I was bit disappointed. Overall it was a decent movie but not worthy of the names it grabbed. I think anyone would agree that this","With the noise it made recently, I could say I was bit disappointed. Overall it was a decent movie but not worthy of the names it grabbed. I think anyone would agree that this movie is like watching a re-mastered version of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" with much focus on the recent changes.
Times were simpler back in 1989 when ""Driving Miss Daisy"" was released and the focus was only on the story and relationship between a Jewish women and Black driver. But in almost three decades' focus became less and less towards the story and more on ""How to force the academy members to vote for this movie?"".
Movie spills its beans way too early and even with that pace, every single step is predictable. Even upcoming scenes could be predicted with exact timing and words. Either writers wanted to stick to the real story too much or they wanted to not show anything to antagonize either color. And as a product of their effort, the output was mediocre.
As far as acting goes, Mahershala Ali is on average. Beside one scene, his acting looks like an effort. For a person like me who has seen him for several years, on House of Cards giving a brilliant performance before he became famous, his portrayal was a huge let down. His effort was visible but he resisted taking risk. Viggo Mortensen on the other hand was closer to the character he was playing. He did not come up with the sharp Italian ascent we'd expect since God Father but his body language was very impressive. Ironically, Viggo was nominated for a similar role 11 years ago for ""Eastern Promises"".
The Green Book is not a bad movie and definitely not a bad idea, but it sure was wasted to milk the recent black cow.",

It's held together by a great script by writers Brian Hayes Currie, Peter Farrelly, Nick Vallelonga, good direction by Peter Farrelly, and terrific performances from Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen (Linda Cardellini was also really good as, you guessed it, the wife). It's not the least bit saccharine or heavy handed. It's just a really enjoyable, and sometimes funny movie that you'll walk out of the theater feeling great about having seen.

Both Viggo and Ali should win Oscars and then the movie itself should win and probably several other categories. I've been waiting for a Viggo performance like this ever since the Lord of the Rings. What makes this even more interesting is the fact that it is a true story. Viggo was so great that I forgot during the movie that it was Viggo. And Ali was so powerful that I hung on his every word. It's moving, touching, real life, and powerful. I found myself laughing so hard sometimes I was crying, not that it was funny like a comedy, but it was humor that can only come from real life and real moments. Amazing movie. Solid 10.

Ali was the strongest actor of the bunch and sometimes you couldn't tell if he was in character or just fed up with the film itself and honestly, mood.
The soundtrack outside of the actual music was generic at best and outright annoying at worst, mainly towards the end of the film.
When their road trip is ending it kinda takes a weird tonal shift and starts to feel like a hallmark Christmas movie, I understand that it is Christmas within the timeline and they wanted a nice heartwarming ending but it felt forced.

A few things pushed the boundaries of believability e.g. the way the driver does such an about turn in his racist views when he through away glasses black men had drunk from at the start to throwing open his home to him at the end. Also it was not believable that the classical pianist immediately and spontaneously became a jazz bar/ popular music player in the bar.

307,23 April 2019,neobateman,8, Funny fluffy comedy about a oppressive time in American history.,"Green Book certainly stirred up controversy when it unexpectedly won Best Picture at the 2019 Academy Awards. I personally didn't care as I lost interest in the Oscars completely (these are the people that nominated Black Panther for Best Picture). Certainly is the film in my Top 5 favorites of 2018, not really. That doesn't mean however that Green Book isn't an endearing, enjoyable and above all funny film about friendship and acceptance. The themes of this film have been highlighted around a zillion times in other films such as The Help. However that doesn't mean that the formula is broken. I for one appreciated this films humor, performances and story. A tough Italian brute (Viggo Mortensen) is looking for a new job. He is hired by an African American musician (Mahershala Ali) to drive him through the Southern States in the early 1960s for a tour. The film wisely goes for humor over melodrama which is what sets it apart from all the other films about this topic. Not that the film doesn't have dramatic moments, in fact these are all the more effective because the two main characters were so likeable and funny. Mortensen gave such a heartwarming performance. His character is a brute, he doesn't mind getting physical when someone pisses him off. But his character also expressed such an aura of warmth were the audience simply gravitated towards him. He doesn't understand the racism, he doesn't get the absolute treacherous and human rights violating laws of Jim Crow under which African Americans suffered. However the film wisely never preaches about the privileged white man not knowing the truth, it just shows it, plain and simple. Ali too gave a terrific performance, his character had a sense of sophistication and coolness even in intense situations. It is incredibly heart wrenching to see such a professional guy who lives his passion pushed to his breaking point by his societies' racist rules. Overall there is not much else to say about Green Book. The themes are obvious and the film doesn't attempt to hide it. Mortensen and Ali are terrific and share great chemistry. A heartwarming family film that allows children to have a more sanitized look into America's darkest points of history. No 12 Years A Slave but still a good time.",

Oh, yes.","Preface to this review before I get to the art itself: This movie is problematic in more ways than one. Not only does it act as though it solves racism by the end (by simply suggesting that people not be racist), it also uses the concept of the white savior (an ideal that everyone should research), which is definitely a move that should be disposed of. If you're willing to ignore that idealism (although you shouldn't), there's more than a few redeeming qualities to this movie.",

326,19 January 2019,Speedysue2003,10, The Greenbook is Excellent,"First, for those reviewers who can't get the Title of the movie. The title is a guide book given to Tony called the Guide to Negro Motorists in the South. He was given the book right before they left NYC. The movie is perfect in every way. Definitely not a Driving Miss Daisy movie. Just a really good movie that touches on many ""untouchable"" topics and situations and how two very different people handle those situations. The racism in the South is very real. The racism in this country right now is very real. The high point of the movie was the argument between the two men regarding who was blacker. Many middle class white people feel this about affluent black people who have more materialstic things than they do. Money. And integrity. It is a very class and race set of circumstances in which one finds oneself; a state of affairs. But many black people feel they are in a situation where it can't change because of their skin color. It can. We are all people; no matter our ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious beliefs etc. This movie really brought that home for me. And it didn't preach or show all the uglies.

My take is it is a solidly good picture, but it also doesn't quite hit the brilliant mark for me as well. Still, what tips the scale beyond being just solidly good is not on the artistry of the making but in the new angle of looking at racial inequality. It seems to suggest for some people, their prejudices based on skin color are more innately grounded and thus, creating almost absurd contradictions in social acceptancy. In short, a person is not quite the totality of his sum, but a collection of fragmented personas which are then treated differently and accordingly depending on the context of what he should be. This is what makes the film so uniquely interesting, this point of view. Viggo Mortensen whom I hardly recognized as the same actor who did Lord of the Rings, or The Road, or Captain Fantastic did a fantastic and transformative job with his character. As for Mahershala Ali, well, he was at least a class or two above in his abilities as an actor in True Detective. Based on this, I must hand it to the director of this show, Peter Farrelly.

This was a made for tv movie made by the man who gave us dumb and dumber. Don't get me wrong kingpin and Mary are exceptional comedies. But this is not a great filmmaker making a great film. This is an ok director making an ok movie. Nothing special here, which appeals to the masses I guess, but to a film buff I simply am sick of movies getting awards because it's time for a color, gender, or sexual preference to get that award.

It addresses one of the painful topics of recent US history, but it does it in a sufficiently careful manner to get a rating that makes it accessible to audiences of almost any age. It has as a hero a musician and includes a lot of (good) music at a time when musical films are again enjoying great success.

(Not that I've seen that much, but I thought the latter was 10 times better here than in Moonlight that got him an Oscar). And Peter Farelli's precise, no frills direction, which I felt was perfect for the story. Parts of it were unavoidably predictable - a black man goes to the deep south in 1962 to perform to all white audiences - bad things are bound to happen. But nearly every predictable episode had a quite unpredictable resolution. And I loved how Tony wasn't just transformed by the extreme racism he witnessed - towards someone he knew and have come to respect, he was also kind of cultured by his overeducated boss.

A really good message behind it. And then he goes to the bar and plays the blues with some other musicians. The acting by both leads was top notch. I see why both were nominated and why Ali won.

The film develops the friendship between the two men as it shows the society of the early 1960s in the North East, the Midwest, and the South. It also exposed me to some modern jazz I hadn't heard, and some traditional jazz from the South that I was familiar with. It reminded me of the richness of American music. The prejudice of their time was depicted in a realistic enough way to bring up anxiety over the fear that minorities faced. In their time racism was ubiquitous; today it is dormant, but the last two years have reminded us that it can rise again if we allow it to. The two men brought their own biases to their meeting and working together, but their humanity and basic good will allowed them to see each other as individuals, overcome their biases, and support one another more over the course of their tour. The issues they faced were at times deathly serious, but their ability to laugh at absurd situations kept the overall tone from becoming dark. In the end, the film seemed like a mixture of comedy, light tragedy, and road trip. I highly recommend the film.",

The movie, though it has some good laughs in it, is clearly more of a dramatic movie and Peter Farelly's first one in his career. I guess he knows how to do great drama too! The performances were stellar. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are terrific together and have a great chemistry in this. The musical scenes were tremendously performed by Mahershala Ali and on top of that the score was great too. For a movie about race and prejudice in the early 60's south it will undoubtedly win you over with its heartwarming touch. Funny and dramatic. This is a great holiday movie. 9/10",

343,25 January 2019,alvesmarceloalves-73751,8, A great film,"It is possible to analyze ""Green Book"" from some points of view. It's a film about racism. But it's also a road movie that talks about an unimaginable friendship. It is also a film that shakes the prejudice of deep America, especially the South of the United States. It is still a film about a character who is not in any environment because he is in the rare position of the privileged black and feels a deep loneliness for it. None of this is original. None of this is something that other movies have not talked about in movie history. But how delightful, bothersome and interesting is to follow the journey of pianist Don Shirley (a brilliant Mahershala Ali) and his driver and captain Tony Vallelonga (equally wonderful).",

345,19 September 2019,Carrzinho,8, Buddy road movie has some extra sparkle,"An Italian-American bouncer takes up the job of driving an African-American pianist on a 2 month tour in the 1960's of America's South.
This is essentially a buddy road movie bringing to mind Midnight Run (1988) and Planes, Trains & Automobiles (1987). Two opposites are placed together and we witness conflict and humour and two characters growing together. So the template is set and it largely follows true as you'd expect.
What make this different is the setting. No matter what is going on there is the palpable racial tension and real threat that could dissolve this affable caper into something altogether more heinous.
This makes it more worthy, in an actual sense and that of the Oscars. This would also be my main criticism of the movie. It feels too crowd pleasing when it could have laboured further on the fight for civil rights.
Viggo Morensen and Mahershala Ali are superb and entirely convincing. Their characters evolve and grow credibly. Linda Cardellini, who i feel is underrated provides an anchor to the story and is excellent.
It's beautifully shot, as a road movie in the south should be. The period element isn't laboured beyond the opening scenes of Tony Lip in his bouncer role but is quietly effective. The soundtrack is top drawer combining Aretha Franklin, Chubby Checker etc with the very interesting, classically influenced, jazz stylings of Dr. Donald Shirley's trio.
Tonally it's hard to argue with, shifting gear effortlessly and it really is very funny indeed. I laughed out loud nearly every time they went for the comedic schtick.
For me it hasn't got the heft of an Oscar winning movie or the uniqueness and magic of e.g. its predecessor The Shape of Water (2017) but it will be timeless, pleasing and important enough to be looked upon with fondness. EIGHT",
346,23 May 2019,leonblackwood,8, Highly entertaining! 8/10,"Review:
What a brilliant film! For such a low budget, and no fancy graphics, this highly entertaining film proves that a good story, and excellent acting, is all you need to produce something special. This reverse ""Driving Miss Daisy"" type road movie, see's Viggo Mortensen (Tony Lip), playing an Italian bouncer, who is forced to take on a job, to drive a African American pianist to various locations during his eight-week concert tour through the Midwest and Deep South, while the Copacabana nightclub, were he works, is closed for renovations. The eccentric and highly educated classical pianist, Doctor Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), hires Tony on the strength of his references, even though there were several candidates up for the job. As this movie was set during the early 1960's, it's extremely rare that a white man chauffeur's a black man, so they had there ups and downs throughout there tiresome journey. The fact that this film is based on real characters, made it even more of a joy to watch, and the various obstacles that Tony and Don tackled together, made them become closer as friends, even though Tony had a problem with black people at the beginning of the film. For this day and age, the subject matter was extremely relevant, especially with the American president trying his utmost to divide us. From an entertaining point of view, there is enough content to keep you glued to the big screen, which is rare for a movie in this genre. Throughout there journey, Don helps Tony write letters to his wife, correctly spelling and rephrasing passages, which I found touching and emotional in places. Even after the episode in the YMCA pool, which I thought would change the direction of the film, was brilliant because the director chose not to dwell on the matter. The main element that made this movie unique, has to be the excellent performances from the leading actors. Their chemistry on screen was amazing, like Cruise & Hoffman in Rainman, and the director shot the period well, but it's not the type of movie that you can watch time and time again. In real life, Tony Lip and Dr. Donald Shirley remained friends until they died within months of each other in 2013, so you're actually watching a life-long relationship unfold on screen. In all, I highly recommend this movie to all adult movie-goers because it has something for everyone, and you will be left feeling hope and joy. Great!",

349,24 November 2018,subxerogravity,9, Two amazing actors totally make this movie!,"Viggo Mortensen plays Tony Lip who gets a job driving around a concert pianist named Dr. Don Shirley, played by Mahershala Ali, around the Deep South. Despite Shirley's money and prestige audience (or more likely because of it) there were only certain places in the Deep South were a man of color can eat and sleep and apparently they had a ""tour guide"" for this called the Green book (Hence the name of the movie). You learn something new everyday.",
350,26 November 2018,stevendbeard,8, Unlikely Friendship,"I saw ""Green Book"", starring Viggo Mortensen-Eastern Promises, the Lord of the Rings movies; Mahershala Ali-Luke Cage_tv, House of Cards_tv; Linda Cardellini-Hunter Killer, Avengers:Age of Ultron and Sebastian Maniscalco-Tag, The House.
This is based on a true story of an unlikely friendship between an Italian_American bouncer and an African_American classical pianist in the 1960's. Viggo plays the bouncer that is between jobs and is hired for 2 months to drive Mahershala, the pianist, on his first concert tour of the deep south. I say unlikely friendship because Viggo is an uncultured racist that uses his fists to settle matters and Mahershala is a sophisticated professional with a doctorate that does not believe in violence. Viggo does have principles that he lives by and he does need the money, so it is interesting to see their views and relationship grow into a friendship. Linda is Viggo's wife and Sebastian is one of Viggo's relatives, neither one of which thinks Viggo will last the whole trip. For those unfamiliar with the era, there were lots of racist ideas about places African_Americans could eat, sleep, buy things, etc. Of course, this would be a problem on the tour with Mahershala-he could perform music for white audiences but could not use the restroom in the same building. The name of the movie-Green Book-refers to 'The Negro Motorist Green Book', which was an actual guide to lodgings, restaurants and businesses that would service African_Americans. It was published from 1936-1966. During the end credits, the actual people are shown and you are told what happened to them after the events of the movie.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for language-including racial epithets-smoking and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 9 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",
351,4 July 2020,TorontoFilmFan,2, A two dimensional movie on American race relations,"This is a simple movie for simple minds. Its premise is a hackneyed plot device served up in cartoonish bite sized bits. The premise: A sophisticated man and a thug are thrown together by fate, and ultimately both learn from and are enriched by this relationship. And when you make one black and one white, and set it in the racist 1960's, the stage is set for the director to make a grandiose statement regarding race. On a sophomoric level, if only we took the time to know each other better we'd all get along better. But more insidiously - and the message Academy Awards voters responded to - that horrible, racial injustice is a thing of the past, and we can now all pat ourselves on the back with how much better things have become.
The problem is, for 2018 when the film was made, and for 2020 when the film is viewed, this saccharine re-writing of current history doesn't wash. Sorry 2018 Academy Awards voters, racism isn't something relegated to the past, from those bad old 60's, and Americans have no reason to pat themselves on the back with how much racial justice has improved since then. Given current events (2020), the movie's message seems even more unreal - and insipid - than when originally released.
The movie is a cartoon both in character development and in events. In an establishing scene the white character throws away some glasses simply because they were drunk from by black men. Yet moments later he is taking a job to work, drive and eat with a black man for an 8 week gig. In another preposterous scene, the black man is feted in a wealthy man's mansion, in fact he is the guest of honour, yet moments later he is forbidden from using the rest room and directed to an out-house visible from the window. As if.
The movie is a slog to sit through and scenes constructed to be hilarious - like eating fried chicken in the car - are inevitably excruciating to watch. There is little pay off for spending two hours of time watching this whitewash of a movie.",

It's a great role - as it should be, since the script was written by the real-life character's son, Nick Vallelonga.

The'white' being the chauffeur of the 'black' and their very different characters and backgrounds are the base for both humorous and endearing moment.

That is because Peter Farrelly's previous credits as writer and director are for Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, Me,Myself & Irene, Shallow Hal and the awful Three Stooges and Dumb & Dumber sequel. He's a comedy writer. He has some great movies in that genre no doubt but this is such a huge leap in a biographical drama that is a commercial and critical success that it is a career turn that nobody seen coming. Yes, there are several laugh out loud moments in this movie and Farrelly will have been able to engineer those scenes to be as funny as they were. Nevertheless, this is still a huge achievement for the producer, director and writer and I hope he is acknowledged on the ultimate stage.",

There was real chemistry between the characters despite their obvious differences, interests and upbringings. The comedy was great and I laughed more than I thought I would, and it was the perfect amount and was done tastefully and was not constant and excessive, so it's not strictly a comedy.

377,3 February 2019,isaacj02,6, Mortensen and Ali shine in charming ride through the Deep South,"Director Peter Farrelly is certainly best known for his big-hearted, light comedies; from Dumb and Dumber to There's Something About Mary, Farrelly has shown himself to be a sure hand at the genre. His new film, Green Book, employs much of the same warm comedy, but along with a far more dramatic narrative.
Green Book is the (though now debatably) true story of Italian-American bar bruiser, Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), who finds work as a driver for a renowned black pianist, Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) as he embarks on a concert tour across the Deep South. The film explores the growing friendship of the two men against the ugly backdrop of segregated America.
There is plenty of fun to be had in Green Book; as expected of Farrelly, there's an effortless charm to the film, supported by belly-laughing humour and spirited characters. The script is occasionally a little clunky, but what truly ensures the success of Green Book is its performances (both Oscar noms). Viggo Mortensen leads as Tony, a big-mouthed big eater, impressively humorous but also adding an emotive touch to a role that could have easily seemed like a caricature. There's a huge heart to Mortensen's lively performance that is somewhat captivating. This is played off nicely by Mahershala Ali, on usual expert form as Dr Shirley. Ali's composure and poise lend his performance this quiet gravitas that seems to find its true culmination in the film's most powerful scene, as Tony and Don argue in the rain as two minorities unaccepted in 1960s America.
It seems a shame, however, that the aforementioned scene is the closest that Green Book gets to really addressing its subject. The racial themes of the film are swiftly glossed over for the most part, even from the beginning where we see an apparently prejudiced Tony dispose of the drinking glasses of two black workmen, only to be seen happily kneeling on the ground playing dice with a group of African Americans some twenty minutes later. The film doesn't just discuss race; class and sexuality are also lingering themes, but both feel all too briefly mentioned. There are certain scenes that do tackle the issues head on and I loved those moments, but much of the film is coated in a layer of sentimentality that, certainly by the third act, becomes almost sugary.
That being said, however, I loved the warmer and lighter points of the film as much as I loved the more dramatic. Though helped certainly by the brilliant performances, Green Book's sentimentality doesn't stop it from being voraciously watchable. The final act drags, suitably like a car with a flat tyre, but otherwise the film is infectiously entertaining, bringing across its narrative in the most accessible way. In the end, perhaps Green Book isn't intended to be a gritty account on race relations; though there is more opportunity for nuanced drama, it feels far more like a feel-good crowd-pleaser.
In the end, Green Book may be a little simplistic in approach for more cultivated audiences, but it remains a thoroughly entertaining romp, made successful by two standout performances.",

Many have said this remark before about the film, so I will continue it by saying it was well acted, well written, well told, overall great movie! Performances from both Viggo and Mahershala were profoundly enjoyable, envisioning real people that you almost wish you were able to meet in real life. The screenplay or writing for it was told once again with a lot of heart, but also found itself being a good personal, conversational script where you as an audience member can find yourself feeling like you could have a similar conversation with someone you know. One of the biggest aspects of this film that I found impactful was the key ethnic demographic as being an Italian-American myself, this all felt very familiar to me. On one side of my family, they experienced much of the same situations as portrayed in the film being an Italian-American family living in the 50's and 60's America where people were divided. Understanding that we are all the same, which are people trying to live their lives to the fullest regardless of the color of their skin. This film's story hit me really close to home, which made it feel like I had a personal attachment to it. In the end, I'm pleased with the film and that a story like this one can be for everyone to enjoy.",

400,6 December 2018,BlackCinemaNow,8, Great Movie!,"So despite my reservations about watching another racially driven movie, I checked out green book. First, let me say that the Italian rhetoric made the film genuinely enjoyable to watch from beginning to end. The 1960s based film is about Tony Lip who is a rough around the edges back streets Italian who is hired to drive slightly eccentric Dr. Don Shirley who is a classically trained black pianist on tour with his trio through the Deep South. Despite being socially accepted in the north, Dr. Shirley takes on this tour where he knows he will encounter issues along the way. Without spoiling the movie, the film explores an unfamiliar narrative of a white person hired to do a job of somewhat servitude for a black person, which I don't remember seeing on this caliber since the body guard. What's interesting to note are two things, the development of the relationship between the two characters from the time they first met to the end of the film and why Dr. Shirley even made the decision to perform in the south which I will leave you to figure out. Both Mahershala ali Viggo Mortensen put on a great performance and the movie definitely has a well-developed storyline.",

Both play off each other brilliantly and again I laughed out loud several times. Viggo should win the Oscar, but wouldn't you know it Mr. Bale is standing in his way.

Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Green Book. I thought it was a strange title for a film then I realised as the film progressed that the Green Book was a thing, and as I sat captivated throughout this entire film I found that it never ceases to amaze and sadden me how humans treat fellow humans based on colour alone. This is a story inspired by the true friendship that developed between Tony Lip, a working-class American Italian from New York and Dr Don Shirley, a black pianist who employs Tony to be his driver for a tour of the Deep South where racial prejudice is right at the forefront of their whole existence. This film was exquisite, a tale of two men who are as far apart as can possibly be, one street smart, rough and ready, the other a highly educated and cultured person. They began as boss and employee and slowly formed a true and lasting friendship. Viggo Mortensen played Tony Lip and delivered a quite amazing performance. He combined the brash Italian character, with someone who had strong family values and a deep sense of good about him, even though he took the job just for the money he developed as a character as the film went along. Mahershala Ali, who played Dr Shirley was elegant and dignified throughout. This is a film I would happily watch again and again.",

I thought the movie was definitely not good, but to my surprise, the film was not bad. Maybe the film was opened for more than 10 minutes. Character has been laying the ground for too long.
The Green Book is a distinctive road movie. I never imagined that a black people affirmative film would be conceived from the perspective of road movies. The road movies have a strong characteristic as narrating a story.
The emotional relationship between characters becomes strong with the increase of mileage, and the personality of the characters is clearly revealed with the increase of mileage. Dr.Don Shirley and Tony Lip are gradually becoming friends on their road of tour.
Some people think that road movies are very simple, because the clues are clear and the narrative is simple. Just make clear what is happening on the road. In fact, road movies are the easiest to become a self-speaking film without any focus. In fact, this movie has not completely escaped this threat. It is true that there is a constant episode in the film on the road, showing the relationship between the two, and then Tony understands Don's practice for him to come forward. But after all, there is no major outbreak, and the whole story lacks a core chapter. Several equally important chapters have made the film without any major ups and downs.",

But after a day or two went by the film really hit me good, and I thought to myself then 'no actually this was a really great film.'
Green Book is a film which really hits you after you watch it. From the images, to the sadness, and anger, to the camaraderie, peace and acceptance. And most of all to the friendship and love during the rough times it was taking place, what a beautiful message the film promotes to all of us. Superbly acted from top to bottom, well written, and well directed as Peter Farrelly steps out of his comfort zone of zany comedy, and makes a warm hearted, comedy-drama (for you Kingpin fans, the road trips in the Green Book will feel kind of nostalgic).
A powerful statement and a film which will put a big smile on your face. In my opinion, some of the best films are the ones which hit you in the heart days after you see it. And Green Book is just that. You will definitely love this film!",

433,25 February 2019,lumieretrain,8, Green Book by Peter Farrelly,"The stories about unexpected friendships are recognized for which are inspired by real events, to see the main characters would initially meet each other for the job. Until they would travel together in a journey, which a friendship between them would come out. Some of these stories would end that the main characters would remain connected by keeping seeing each other, others would end that the main characters would separate each of their roads but without forgetting what an incredible bond they have. The filmmaker Peter Farrelly was intrigued to release a movie about friendships, inspired by a real event but without his brother Bobby Farrelly's collaboration. In 2018 came out Green Book by Peter Farrelly, with Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. The movie's plot: in 1960s, an Italian-American bouncer Tony Vallelonga or also known as Tony ""Lip"" (Viggo Mortensen), would get a job as driver and bodyguard for the talented jazz pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali). For the long venues tour through South America, since they would travel in this journey a friendship between them would come out. The movie is a comedy-drama which mixes both elements to be workable, by using the humor in a natural way without forcing it and the drama can be emotional to be touching. The movie's narration tells the story to catch the audience attention, as the screenplay was elaborated to maintain the rhythm without ruing it. Viggo Mortensen did an excellent performance as Tony Lip, who would act in a rude way when he would take some actions. But since he would travel in the venues tour, he would take care Don Shirley to make sure Don would not get in trouble. In the course of the story Tony would write love letters to his wife, until he would get helped by Don to express better Tony's emotions. Mahershala Ali was extraordinary as Don Shirley who even is a talented jazz pianist, he would be seen with bad eyes because of the racism at the time set on the movie. Don Shirley and Tony Vallelonga would find out through the tour, they have many things in common to be then close to each other. They both would also help each other to find solutions, to be surprisingly smart as they would move forward on their journey. Green Book is one of the best 2018's movies, Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were both surprisingly extraordinary in the movie.",

One character, a virtuoso pianist of African American descent, is doing his part to dismantle the race barriers which identified much of our society then, and even today, while also managing other facets of his personal identity. Now, place him in a small space (a gorgeous teal 1962 Caddilac Sedan d'Ville) for a long time with an unsophisticated bouncer/brawler/man-of-the-streets from New York, and watch the humanity ooze. The filmaker did not grovel to us, the audience, with simplicity-of-character; each main character brings to light the true complexities of the experiences that each of us endure and manage in this ever complex world, and honored those unique attributes in ways that make you, as the film viewer, feel hnored for the unique and complex person that you are, and I am, and each of us are. It proffered the humbling truth about slipping into ""simple thought"" and geralizing about any individual or group of individuals is a disservice to our own dignity. A nice flip of the name-calling, tolerance of unconstructive behavior toward others, racism, sexism, and other judgements thast are used by the more powerful to subvert the less powerful. Each character demonstrated that whether one is of the most educated and priveledged class, or of the most street-wise and unsophisticated class, personal dignity and respect are mandatory for a successful life...and sometimes valuable perspective and insight comes from the least likely of sources; we need each other.",

On the surface it may be seen as remarkable struggle by an African-American pianist against racism in the deep South in 1962 as well as his friendship with a working-class white man. Thanks to tour de force performances by the two leads, Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen, director Farrelly avoids cliches on discrimination and instead provokes some universal hints on polarization, alienation and discrimination under the disguise of tolerance in modern times. As Don Shirley beautifully yet sadly talks about sense of belonging, Green Book makes me think about new versions of green book approach (i.e. adapted forms of discrimination) remains in the minds of people -- the US or elsewhere. By the same token, the world cannot be a better place until we all learn the value of coexistence and understanding as opposed to othering and polarizing.

446,17 May 2019,PCT1970,9," ""I Know It's A Complicated World""","Farrelly steps outside his normal films somewhat to helm one of the finest comedy dramas in recent memory. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, soundtrack, settings and acting. The entire cast delivers the goods. In particular Ali and Mortensen are superb. Their portrayals of the characters and their friendship are so convincing, they emit a real life feeling. Based on a true story, the plot revolves around Dr. Don Shirley who is an African American prodigy pianist. By his own choice Shirley decides to embark on a concert tour in the Deep South during 1962. Knowing he will need protection, Shirley hires Tony Lip whose reputation as a fast talking, tough bouncer proceeds himself. Lip is an Italian American who resides in the Bronx and is currently unemployed due to renovations at the Copacabana. So as fate has it, the two men from completely different sides of the proverbial spectrum start a unique road trip. Despite their differences in culture and ethnicity, which is revealed through their constant banter and time spent alone together, the men form a special bond. This all occurs while the two men face danger and racism during an era of segregation. The plot is clever, crisp, insightful, thought provoking, heartwrenching, heartwarming and has a wonderful ending. There are many memorable scenes and quotes in this film. Lip's quote, ""Don't worry 'bout it. I been working nightclubs in New York City my whole life. I know it's a complicated world."" rings true today. That is what adds to making this an eventual timeless and classic work of art, which is symbolic of the friendship that was formed.",

It must be said that both fully are deserving their respective Oscar nominations. Furthermore, the issue of race is dealt with in a notably tasteful manor; underpinning the story plot by vividly portraying the struggles of a black man in Southern America. Nonetheless, the film succeeds in almost having a 'feel-good' theme with respect to the relationship between Dr Don Shirley and Tony Lip, which blossoms as their journey goes on, overcoming both their own respective prejudices and the prejudices of the people around them.",

I don't know if it's just a blip in studio output but they have recently released some good films with different stories. The whole cast were excellent, the editing / pacing well done, all helped by a script that had a bit of everything. Furthermore it's not a PC preachy type, it just retells a story for viewers to consider. Very good, watch when you can.",
456,21 November 2018,halavurta,8, Solid character building,"It is not easy to convince viewers to a newly established friendship in 2 hours. Green book is super entertaining and more than that it is a great character building movie. Character development is right on pace, not rushed or not boring. Every scene works for understanding each character and their relationship to each other. There isn't big speech or sacrificing, but you can feel the bond getting created between these two men. Great plot and very successful narrative.
Cinematography is pretty decent. From New York City and new yorkers to the beauty of the nature of south and southern lifestyle. Everything is needly put together. Viggo Mortensen is in one of his best works and Mahershala Ali is helping him great. Probably in the best threes movies I've seen so far in this year.",
457,3 April 2021,victoryavalon,10, Golden Heart!,This movie is just so beautiful & such a fun joy ride & such a art when it comes to adressing history & showing us a little more into the culture of music & Mahershala Ali is such a master piaonist & his music is so heartwarming & powerful & I say this movie is for those who are tryin to find the soul in Music. Ooh also Viggo Mortenson was soo flippin funny in this movie & such a great actor <3.,
458,17 March 2019,Benslie,10, A surprise masterpiece of film,"First of all, the acting in this done by both Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen was amazing. Mahershala Ali got all the awards for his performance as Don Shirley and you can see why. They easily contracted each other in more than one ways. This helps to show that opposites really do attract in both friendships and relationships. Throughout the film, you can see both actors giving it their all in every scene they are in. Both characters in this film have character development that is perfect for their character. This is because both of them teach the other something and help them grow as a person. Whether it be Tony teaching Shirley how to loosen up a bit or Shirley teaching him how to write letters. This film isn't afraid to show how in the 1960s racism was very prominent and how we still face that in this day and age. While watching this film you notice how things that happen back then still happen now and wonder why that is. Even though they do take this subject matter seriously like they should they also throw in a bit of humor in well-placed scenes that helps not take it away from the serious topic it's dealing with. This film is two hours and ten minutes and you don't feel it. Really even though I don't say it that much I kinda wish it was a tiny bit longer. Nothing in this film felt rushed and felt at the speed it should be going at. There are a few scenes that I would've cut but not that many. In the end, this is a film that I think everybody should check out at least once. Whether just to learn about this interesting story about two friends who defied the odds or just a movie to watch.",

Didn't remember main actor (Viggo) from previous movies but he was decent; supporting actor Ali continues to impress and show his range as an actor. Could have given it a 10 but since they kept the graphic racist actions that probably occurred to a PG-13 level, I chose to give a 9. PG-13 hopefully makes it a fan favorite for years to come because there is much to learn from this story.",

463,28 January 2019,warthogjump,10, Finally something so refreshing!!,"This movie deserves to win Oscars for every nomination. It has a great message, extraordinary screenwriting and even better acting from the two leads. Peter Farelley is a genius himself. The perfect mix of comedy and drama, but it feels so natural thanks to the amazing chemistry of Viggo and Ali. There is not one scene which feels unnecessary or even exaggerated. It is like stepping back in time to 1962 with emphasis on what is really important in life: family, dignity and being true to oneself. There are many movies which try to convey such messages, but none so seamlessly. As important as these messages are, this movie gets a 10/10 because the journey of the two lead characters can be appreciated even more, many thanks to the script, directing and of course the acting. Best movie of the year in my opinion.",

465,20 June 2019,schroederagustavo,10, Fantastic Movie with lots of humor,"This movie is pretty fantastic. I was surprised by the amount of humor in it, I was expecting more of a serious drama considering the subject matter, but boy, am I glad that they went with this route. Both of the main performances are fantastic, I especially think Viggo Mortensen was truly amazing in this movie and to take this part at this stage in his career, I think is amazing. I really got to the point where I forgot that I was watching Viggo Mortensen, because he's so good in the role that he completely becomes this working class italian bouncer, he's really really outstanding here. The movie has a great message, of course, but it's not like hitting you over the head with it, I think it comes pretty natural. The only downside I see here is that it's kind of predictable what's gonna happen from the start, you know these two are gonna end up getting along, no matter what. But I don't think that takes away too much from the film, because I had a blast with it and was not expecting to laugh so many times out loud, the writing is hilarious in this film.",
466,6 November 2019,handmadegiasena,10, Simply beautiful.,"This is a story of 2 men from different backgrounds who go on a journey together both literally and metaphorically.
Yes, there is a racial element to it which you would expect from a story set partly in the American deep south at that time but this isn't a story about racism.
The white man is not the eloquent, educated man. Tony is a rough diamond. He is the best artist who ducks and dives to make ends meet. He's a family man who adores his wife and he is a man who stands by his word.
Don is a talented, articulate man who is alone in the world. He has made music his life.
The men form an unlikely friendship that had me laughing, tearful, but mostly smiling.
This movie has heart.
Don could have easily been a white man or Tony a black man. I say this to emphasise that this isn't a movie about black and white. It's about friendship.
Why did Don choose to tour the deep south when he could command more money elsewhere?
Some might say that he wanted to connect with his roots. I don't.
When the black men and women who were working in the field all stopped to stare at the impeccably dressed black man being chauffeured by a white man was the key. For me, it was showing other people of colour that they can achieve anything they want. They are no longer slaves to the white man. That's my take away from it.
It is a simple story but told so well. If the aim was to make us feel warm and fuzzy then it did its job.",

It's essentially a male 'driving miss daisy'. It is SO predictable so quick, I just rolled my eyes. I'm sure it was supposed to be funny that it was a role reversal that ali's Character was the refined one and mortensen's the white trash one, but it wasn't funny. At all. I don't really have a lot to say about this film because it's not memorable. Skip it for sure.",
468,13 March 2019,ipetro-20580,1, Treating us like imbeciles,"The whole point of this ""woke"" waste of time is to somehow put together a story where the white guy is an uneducated, racist thug, whereas the black guy is a cultivated, intelligent musician... Take those legos and make a space shuttle out of that.
It's bad, all around. Badly acted, badly scripted, full of cliches and veeery slow. Scenes are set up over and over again to make us understand how racist this one is, and how cultivated the other is. Oooook, thanks ! We get it !
Mortensen would probably give a better performanse as an amoeba than an Italian tough guy. And by the way, Italians are represented here as a Saturday Night Live version of the Sopranos... but really not funny. For a ""woke"" movie, they'll certainly offend the Italians.

471,8 November 2019,kit_lok,9, Massively enjoyable,"Marhershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are simply amazing in this film. The acting was spot on, Mortensen's ""Tony the Lip"" was wonderfully comedic as the foil to the intelligence of Ali's Don Shirley or the Doc as they called him. The pair worked together wonderfully well together and on screen it did look like a convincing pairing. The story is simple enough to follow, the majority light hearted and funny but also it deals with issues such as the racial injustice of the deep south at the time. The character of Don Shirley is complicated which Ali shows his depth to bring this character to screen. My wife and I were thoroughly entertained throughout the film. I seem some reviews that what to politicalise the film, it's just a film about two guys who form a friendship through difficult times and just enjoy it and learn from it.",

477,10 November 2018,Roy-faltesek,8, Lots of laughs amid a heart warming story,"Watching the friendship build between an uneducated racist white Italian and a well educated master black musician was entertaining and heart warming. And all the more poignant knowing it is based on a true story. At one point there is a discussion between the two about the wisdom of peaceful versus violent reaction to racism, a timely lesson or reminder for us all to hear in a time when an entire political party is being hijacked with extremist views (the press are our enemy, the Honduran caravan is an invasion, and ""there were good people on both sides"").",
478,11 November 2019,anthonyf94,7, Behind black and white,"Story of a black musician and a white bodyguard, ""Green book"", through the archaic system of trip and adventures during it, is based on the opposition between this two characters that discover to like each other beyond the differences of status and skin that society stresses. The particularitg is in the fact that the white man is of asocial condition less higher than the black man's one, that's instead a rich and famous pianist. This strange condition, for 60s racist USA, brings the protagonist to a tragedy of not being part of a defined group: he is richer than other black men but always different, for the skin, from ""real"" white people; so his dramatic situation is to be outside of all of categories. Through ironical and light expedients, the movie condemns racism but also understand complexity of psychological lifes behind conventional social divisions, and, even if for wasn't the best movie of that year to win the Oscar, it is appreciable and original.",

Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are outstanding in this film and their on screen chemistry is nothing short of amazing. Viggo Mortensen proves once again that he's one of the best with foreign languages and accents. It's inspiring to see him constantly take these risks as an actor with new voices and mannerisms. I recommend watching Moonlight (2016) and this one, back to back, to fully appreciate Mahershala Ali's performance. He's truly versatile and has fully established himself as one of the best actors of this generation. Just compare his performance in Moonlight (2016) with this one and you'll see what I mean. The movie has lots of funny moments but also moments where you are moved. All around a great film that touches your heart, stimulates your brain and inspires you. I just might add this movie to my list of heartwarming Christmas flicks.
Highly recommended 9/10.",

486,8 February 2019,eagandersongil,7, The superficial script. And the great performances,"""Greenbook"", a film that calls attention to the acting and direction, but it sins in the script, the new long one of the experienced director Peter Farrelly arrives with an inexplicable force for the ossuary 2019. Telling the story of a racist Italian driver that arranges a job of a renowned black musician. The drama of the film is inspired by facts and is good, but the solutions of script are weak and end up leaving the average film. Script options, how to expose Tony's racism is silly, has no depth and meaning, is made solely and exclusively to cause empty aversion to the viewer, and opt for a line of script that follows in every movie, we have the discussion, the problem, the resolution and the moral lesson, such a set of events are repeated throughout the film without any news, which ends up leaving the work extremely predictable beyond its last scene, which I like for the good feeling that it cause, but it diverges from the movie message, which is good, but poorly executed.
But not everything is hurt. Viggo Mortessen is very cool in his character, a raw Italian, the actor seems to have fun in making a mega canastrão character, and that suits him a lot, you perfectly buy the character. And Mahershala there is great again, bringing us a dubious and confused character with his ideas, a deep character with troublesome feelings and veiled veils in a layer of coldness, and Ali's performance restrains this to perfection.
Another cool point is Peter's focused direction, with great set compositions, a bluish photograph and good use of the cameras, the director drives his film well, nothing exceptional and the only technical mistakes are associated with script mistakes. ""Green book"" does not enchant, but it is a legal film, mainly on account of its protagonists.",

It's a story we have seen before, and will likely see again, but it's these two actors' chemistry that make this film.

What I like in Green Book that I might not like in other films, it's that It goes straight to the point, to what It should tell first. Mahershala Ali's acting is stunning, that I think he's a true contender for a second Oscar; Mortensen's performance is breathtaking as well.

This is a movie that cares about its characters first and foremost and we don't see many of those films hitting the big screen very often, so this was a pleasant surprise.

It's enjoyable and easy to watch and a lovely little story line but best picture? Seriously? And while Mahershala Ali deserved the Oscar for Moonlight (a stunning film) this win was a real stretch. He was not believable in this role and the dialogue was eye rolling worthy at times. Not his fault, he did the best he could with it. He's a great actor but I just felt the film was too shallow and trying too hard in the ""feel good"" department. I enjoyed it but compared to The Godfather? Gimme a break on the 10 stars lol.

Though I've seen the ratings and hear the fuss around it. It released in India a week later then the American release but I know like me many could've missed it. I'm Glad, finally I got the time to see it and I want to write about it. So, this movie is inspired by the true story about friendship between Donald Shirley (Ali), an erudite African-American pianist and his white chauffer Tony (Viggo). First of all, I didn't know what ""GREEN BOOK"" is before I saw the movie. It is a book which is ""to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trip more enjoyable"" because African-American travelers faced hardships such as white-owned businesses refusing to serve them or repair their vehicles, being refused accommodation or food by white-owned hotels, and threats of physical violence and forcible expulsion from their town. So, it is a journey between them and how they're able to accept each other throughout. It is a ""MUST SEE"" movie even though you were not sure about what it is like to have an African American in 1960s. I enjoyed many scenes specially when they enter Kentucky and enjoyed KFC though Don was reluctant at first because of hygiene. I can't reveal much and I don't want to because the movie shows the essence of humanity which is above color and discrimination. There're many heart wrenching scenes too and humor top notch.

As a child I remember traveling just 20 miles south of where we lived and everyone spoke with a deep southern drawl.
I am glad social awareness is spreading in the right way and Green Book reminded me about my life in the south pre-MTV I call it. Brutish to northerners and people of color.

Viggo Mortensen plays Tony 'the Lip', a small time bouncer who is hired to drive Doctor Don Shirley, a piano virtuoso on his concert tour of the Deep South. The year is 1962, segregation is in full swing and racism is everywhere, including in New York.
This is a warm, moving story about two men who form a strong friendship that overcame both of their prejudices and helped each man become a better person. It's based on a great true story, well acted and well directed, earning its many nominations and awards and the controversy surrounding the film is worth overlooking.

It reminds us of the segregated south and it's evils (alas too much of which still remains) but it does it almost surreptitiously. It makes it personal, so we can understand it better.

539,17 February 2019,andrewroy-04316,6," Crowd pleasing thanks to its humor and performances, but ultimately overly predictable, bland, and forgettable","I have few big complaints about Green Book, but just an hour after watching it little of it stayed in my mind. It's a dramedy focused on the relationship between a working class white guy and a black pianist in the 1960s. Mortensen and Ali are both excellent in their roles, with Mortensen bringing some depth to an exaggeratedly written character and Ali bringing a balance of professionalism and emotion. Their relationship certainly has its share of humor, and it is fun to be along for the ride as they banter. I didn't think the racial elements of their relationships and identities were well explored, with the exception of Ali's monologue about how he doesn't fit in with any community. Mortensen was overtly racist early on, and there's no real explanation for why he's quickly so willing to work for a black high class man and put those prejudices aside. The differences in viewpoints and nuance were largely brushed aside in favor of a broader, optimistic arc where both of them are just good friends who save the other from racial/class problems when they need it. The ending does a good job of bringing full circle the themes of courage and integrity, but they still feel quite surface level and manufactured for easy, light satisfaction. The humor is fine and adds to the movie but isn't essential to it. It's a movie that's easy to sit back and go along with, but a hard one to think deeply about and come away with new elements to ponder. It's a crowd pleaser, but felt all to predictable and pandery to be memorable.",

Tony lives in New York with his family in the early 1960s. He is Italian and talks like a sailor and also speaks Italian. The club Tony is a bouncer for closes down for repair and Tony needs a job. A human being with amazing gastric ability like Tony can only earn so much money from hot dog eating contests!
Dr. Donald Shirley (Mahershala Ali) is the polar opposite of Tony. He is not a medical doctor and has doctorates in music and psychology instead. He is also a gifted African-American pianist from the age of 3 and beyond. Dr. Shirley is well-breed, polite and intelligent. Tony is offered a job from Dr. Shirley to act as the man's chauffeur and body guard. He has to drive him through the prejudiced south to gigs. They use the titular Green Book as a guide to motels both men can stay at.
Two men who are poles apart become very good friends in this wonderful biopic! Tony introduces Don to the music of other black musicians like Little Richard and Aretha Franklin. He also shows him how good KFC is. On the other hand, Don teaches Tony how to write lovely letters to his wife and how to be well mannered.
Tony's son wanted to tell everyone about this unlikely friendship and this is a loving portrayal of his late father who was born in 1930 and died in 2013. Dr. Shirley was three years older than Tony and by a strange coincidence, died in the same year. I recommend this movie highly!",

547,1 February 2019,xmdbx,6, A Step Above the Traditional Buddy Comedy,"This movie is a buddy comedy with some serious circumstances thrown in it. It has the typical story where two people from wildly different backgrounds are forced to be together and eventually overcome their differences to become lifelong friends. We've seen it so many times before that we know what is going to happen when we see the movie poster. In that sense, it is nothing new and nothing special. What I think puts this film a step above the rest is the acting. Specifically, Viggo Mortensen. I think he does a very nice job of playing the cliche endearing scumbag. He's funny but competent and that does a lot for the movie. Mahershala Ali also does a decent job but I don't think it's anything special. He does well with the limited range that the script allows. Since the film is centered almost entirely around them, it is entertaining and able to keep your attention. However, not all of the acting was good. The more the Italian family was in the film, the worse it got. It's just so uncomfortable watching such a cliche loud Italian family. Other transgressions that I think the film commits include Mortensen's character having contradictory views on race and the frequent contrived teaching points. These types of things are expected in this kind of movie but that doesn't make them any less diminishing. Overall, it is a decent film that almost overcomes it's genre.",

I would love to challenge Hollywood to make some movies that try to accomplish a sense of unity in this nation. I would love to see that.

Green Book was the movie I enoyed the most this past year. It kept me engrossed from start to finish and at the end I felt that was two hours well spent. Acting was superb, store was fasinating, and it was fairly accurate as biographies go. Even though I came of age during the time period of the movie I had never heard of Don Shirley. His musical style does combine jazz, pop, and classical touches and it played well on the big screen in 7.1 Dolby. A great sound track of his music as well as other popular music of that era. Yes, the movie was somewhat formulaic but so what? It was both funny and dramatic and captured the spirit, good and bad, of the times. I especially liked the way the movie opened with recreated scenes of the famous Cocacabana night club in New York, and ending with the extended family Christmas dinner in the Bronx. The two leads should both get Oscars as should the original screenplay. My overall feeling is the movie somewhat downplayed the racial issues in the south, even though they were disturbing to watch. I have a feeling it was even worse that we northeners could imagine. But maybe that is what made the movie enjoyable - it wasn't a downer by any means, but reflected the good in people for the most part. Go see it. It is a great story with great actors.",

563,1 December 2019,barevfilm,10, Richly deserved Best Film Oscar for 2018,"A working-class Italian-American bouncer becomes the driver of an African-American classical pianist on a tour through the 1960s Jim Crow American South.
After a string of weak and questionable choices in recent years the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences finally got it right for a change by awarding Green Book the Best Film Oscar of 2019.
Whether or not similar stories have been told before (e.g., Driving Miss Daisy) this one takes the cake on every level. Viggo Mortensen is beyond belief as the low class Italian American slob hired to Chauffeur an erudite posh mannered snobbish  Pianist (Don Shirley) on a concert tour of the horridly outrageously racist deep south in 1961. The way in which their early antagonism turns into deep friendship along the way is told in a most amusing manner skedaddled along by the bottomless talents of both actors. The situations are perfectly chosen to point up the deepening racism the deeper south they go. In one rain soaked scene we are subtly reminded that in the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave there actually existed places (in Mississippi) where it was illegal for a black person to be see on the streets after dark! ( don't let the sun set on you) -- Shameful, shameful but true! In this scene Viggo punches out one redneck cop and both land in jail. Will they ever get out of this one? -- Shirley knows his rights and is allowed one call to a lawyer. The return call shocks the sickening redneck cops into letting the prisoners go. It was from the Attorney General in Washington -- Shirley was a personal friend of RFK, brother of JFK -- neither mentioned by name.
The picture opens without so much as a main title plunging right in to the back story of Tony Lip the night club bouncer (Mortensen) and his Italian dialect speaking extended family with Mafioso connections. All mix their English up with snatches of Sicilian immigrant Italian (subtitled) adding an immediate element of authenticity. We don't even get to the main part of the film for art least twenty minuted when Tony, out of work, is hired for a well paid job as a chauffeur and bodyguard by Shirley (Mahershala Ali, Best supporting actor) but this part alone is almost a complete movie in itself. We don't get to understand that the Green Book of the title is the name of an actual hotel/motel guidebook that was published to help black people find accommodations when traveling in the racially segregated south until nearly a third of the way into the story. But by this time the tone is already set. Another strong plus is the way Shirley's swift piano fingering is shown without a hitch making it look as if Ali is doing the playing himself.
At the Oscars Spike Lee was brimming with bitterness that his BlaKKKlansman was so easily outflanked by Green Book, but having seen both pictures I am inclined to agree with the critic who said that he was very glad that a heartwarming and highly entertaining film like Green Book won out over Lee's angry hate filled diatribe. And that's exactly what KKKlansman was. A hate filled diatribe.
Ps: Although I was very favorably impressed by Rami Malek's rendition of Freddy Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody I was even more impressed by Mortensen's amazing ability to totally enter the skin of a low class Italian slob and endow the role with a perfect mix of violence, humor, and humanism. For me it was Best Actor, Viggo.",

Viggo with weight gain and all is amazingly authentic as the good hearted hot tempered Italian American driver. There are some laugh out loud funny parts like the letter writing and fried chicken. The humorous tone and approach of the movie is what sets it apart from other race relation movies. That doesn't mean that it glosses over the discrimination at the heart of the movie. Even if you think you have seen enough of white people behaving badly in the South the incidents portrayed really cause the most righteous indignation in anyone watching. Very illuminating is the difference between the cops in the North and South.,

You only win when you maintain your dignity.',"Director Peter Farrelly co-wrote with Brian Currie and Nick Vallelonga, brother of the main character, this true story adaptation for film. It succeeds on many levels, not the least of which is a reflection on the racism of the 1960s era as a too close comparison for the current status of prejudice. It is a powerful movie that makes its point simply and strongly, largely due to the very fine performances By Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali.",

It seemed a bit off some times, with the elevated black man behaving inexplicably or not knowing or understanding some concepts, but having perfect knowledge of other more complex ones. The completely unbiased Italian-American family was also a bit of a stretch. But the tale is heartwarming and fun, without getting into violence or too much ugliness and the acting is good.",

It's one of those movies that made me laugh, that made me cry, and that made me sit there in shock, in wonder and awe. This movie is simply about a black man and a white man, and a friendship, an unlikely friendship tying them together. With all the challenges that they face, and the obstacles in the way, they face them, and you'll see what happens next. The story of Tony Lip and Doctor Shirley is surely a story that we want our children to know, their children to know, and our great grandchildren to know, and the entire generation passed down before us; to show people what really matters in the world, what reigns over racism and electronics and following what the society does, letting reputation get the best of you. These are all the least important. Friendship can tie us together. So let us appreciate it. It doesn't matter what other people do, it matters what you do. What you do, make it right.

579,27 February 2019,cricketbat,8, Best film? Debatable. Good movie? Definitely.,Green Book is anchored in two wonderful performances by Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen. Their characters are complex and nuanced and it's the relationship between these two characters that keeps you engaged. It's also interesting to see Peter Farrelly direct something that isn't as goofy as his previous movies. This story felt unique and was able to address the subject of racism in a way that didn't feel cliched or cartoonish. Is it the best film of 2018? That's debatable. But it's definitely enjoyable.,

Initially he shows prejudice towards them but as he accepts to be the driver of Maharshala Ali (Don Shirley) he understands the evil of Jim Crow in the southern states. While the plot may be generic and Oscar bait, the performances makes it worthy enough for a watch.

As a white man, it seemed to me that racism showed in an obvious way in the past. However, that still run in today's society in more of a discreet way. It's due to the social media where it becomes the world in a smaller place. The stubborn white people become smarter to avoid the obvious. Tony Lip is a perfect example of many naive white men who were being surrounded by blue collars. They're not bothered to learn about the society through a different lens because they see survival in simply way at finest as a priority.

While pat and predictable at times, the film tells an engaging story about the growing friendship between the disparate leads. Viggo Mortenson is excellent as 'Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga' (a real-life character straight out of a Scorsese screenplay) although at first the character comes off as a bit stereotypical, but I found Mahershala Ali's 'anti-stereotypical' urbane, polyglot classical pianist Don Shirley somewhat of a caricature at times. I liked the film more than I expected to and while I understand why there was some controversy about its somewhat fairy-tale depiction of understanding and reconciliation, the excellent acting and core story of a growing bond between two men make the film well worth watching.",

On the way there journey they learn about each other and themselves to find some middle ground between each other. In these Hollywood period pieces, you normally get the 'prejudice is everywhere even in ourselves' cliche. I think this movie could have used more originality in this subject matter.

An Italian-American working in a nightclub in the sixties of last century accepts the job of driver of an African-American pianist during a tour the latter is going to do in the Deep South. Their very diferent cultures and minds soon lead to situations of deep disagreement. Nevertheless as the tour goes on they begin to be closer to each other and they end up not only undertanding and respecting each other but also becoming respectful friends. This is speciallly patent when durig the tour the negro pianist is a target of racial discrmination and even of physical aggression and always gets help from his driver. A movie that shows excellently how was the American society at that time particularly in the Deep South and how the relationship between those two so different men develops itself.,

It is an OK film with surprise ending that is not very surprising. Personally the idea of selecting Viggo Mortensen to play italian is controversial choice when his aspect is not full-blooded: the same issue was when he played (jewish) Sigmund Freud a couple years ago.

Many critics seem upset the film doesn't go far enough in its criticism of systemic racism but that is not necessarily the point of the movie.

No matter where do you come from, and what is your background, you can see this movie and enjoy 99.9% of it. Just with a notch of comedy when necessary, inherently charming acting of Viggo, fantastic acting of Maharshala, for which they both received the Oscar nomination, and Maharshala won it for the second time after Moonlight.
It's such an easy movie to watch, and such an easy one to love. Let alone the cinematography and the expected beautiful landscapes when driving in American roads.

Many times throughout the film I was waiting for an over the top, unrealistic display of the characters morals. I am very glad that this never happened, great credit to the Director for allowing the smaller moments to carry the film. In doing so you are given time to think about all these moments and what they mean to you and the characters. These characters evolve through the film as they both learn about themselves and each other. Again not shown with grand gestures but with small changes, just how the main theme of Racism needed to be changed and still does even to this day.
The modesty of the film sets itself apart from other films of its type. It doesn't feel the need to shove its important themes down in your face but hope you have the openness to acknowledge them.
Both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are well worth the watch and both deserving of award nominations as well as the Director Peter Farrelly.

665,31 January 2019,Troy_Campbell,7, Two commanding central performances.,"Based on a true story, this drama retells of how Italian-American bouncer-turned-driver Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga and African-American pianist virtuoso Dr. Don Shirley became friends during a 1960's concert tour of the Deep South. The plot may be relatively simple but the road trip these two embarked on couldn't have been more difficult. A turbulent time for African-Americans (when isn't it?) - particularly down south - Dr. Shirley faced constant racism in his pursuit to spread the splendour of his music. Written by a trio including Nick Vallelonga, the screenplay has some issues. Operating in the well-worn 'odd-couple' subgenre (it's essentially a flipped Driving Miss Daisy), it relies heavily on cliché to progress their relationship along. Dr. Shirley is the hard-nosed, cultured artist who at first is dismayed by Tony's uncouth behaviour, however, after bonding over racist cops, pub beat-downs and eating fried chicken (that Tony introduces to Dr. Shirley), their vast differences become the glue to their friendship. Yet the familiarity of the plot beats and character developments is largely surpassed by two powerhouse performances that elevate proceedings beyond the midday-movie script. Mahershala Ali imbues Dr. Shirley with layers of hidden guilt and regret, not least over his ostensible distance from the black community, whilst his stiff upper lip veneer subtly wavers through a plethora of emotional tribulations. As the other half of the duo, Viggo Mortensen's no-frills wiseass is also a complicated beast; his desire to do the right thing and be a more well-rounded person constantly battles with his overt masculinity and lack of formal education. Showered with awards nominations and wins already, Green Book overcomes its narrative shortfalls through commanding, complex portrayals by Ali and Mortensen.",

Based on a true story which is very simple not any twists or a single unbelievable situation. It is a saga of black and white human's friendship which grows from bottom to high sky. They give and takes interchange their native qualities. First part of the movie is not so impressive but when end is coming over then we realise the value of what we are seeing on the screen. Ending is very fascinating where 'Doc' comes Tony's house and meets them especially with Tony's wife.
As me this is the most emotional scene of the movie and other word it is highlight of the movie. Acting from Viggo Mortensen ( Tony ), Mahershala Ali ( Dr. Shirley) and Linda Cardellini ( Dolores ) are brilliant performance. Atmosphere of 18th century is created very well. Last credit gives you photo of real personalities of this story definitely will connect to the movie after ending too.

I'd put this off for a long time, but this time the Random Film Generator gave me no choice, and I really tried to keep an open mind. But this is a clod-hoppingly cloying, naive, sometimes downright insulting racism drama that's elevated by two quite brilliant performances from Mahershala Ali (no coincidence that his Oscar was for Supporting Role rather than Leading ...) and Viggo Mortensen. They are in a different film altogether, one with grace notes, subtleties and intelligence that they must have mined from somewhere other than screenplay or direction. Recognition for the likes of Moonlight and Parasite in recent years don't make up for the elevation of this very ordinary film to heights and publicity it doesn't deserve (central performances aside), but they suggest that there may be some forward steps being taken.

Likewise, the gorgeous American landscape in this ""road movie"" set in 1962 is tilled by black farmworkers not looking a whole lot different from their slave ancestors a century before. And then there is the titular ""Green Book"" (of clubs, hotels, garages, barbers' shops, beauty parlours, etc.) that in its oh-so-tasteful and user-friendly way provides handy hints to Americans of colour - needless to say the (real-life) book calls them ""N**ro Motorists"" - how to get the most of their tourism in the southern states ... without there being any tensions.",

This film is a gift.
Now that most movies are just full of gratuitous violence, vulgarity, or simply awful, Green Book offers us an example of old style cinema. A simple but beautiful and captivating story, nicely filmed, with great dialogues, sublime acting, and great music.
Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are immense, and the chemistry between them is so perfect.

716,25 October 2020,ivanmessimilos,10, Amazing movie about unusual frienship,"A great story about an unusual friendship in the 1960s. The greatest strength of this film is the great story that is told through two characters who cannot be more different than they are, but still complement each other perfectly. The two main actors have done an amazing job, especially the great Viggo Mortensen. The way their relationship progresses from the first meeting, where they immediately saw that they could not be different and through a journey where they learn a lot about the other, but also about themselves until the end of the film, I think they succeeded in all intent to present us an unusual duo at a strange time, and to provoke our emotions. I liked the film very much and the more I think about it, the more I realize I can't find any flaw in it. I can understand that someone won't like a movie because of a sensitive topic like racism, but I haven't even personally experienced the film solely through that prism. I think the theme is more geared towards people's relationship to each other, regardless of skin color and place of origin because it doesn't determine what kind of people we are as we can't choose or influence it. However, what kind of people we will be, it is determined exclusively by ourselves through our behavior towards others, our actions and our relationships with people. We influence that very much. Although there are some awkward and unfair scenes due to the theme, at times I got the impression of a feel good film, although I'm not sure that the director (Peter Farrelly is known exclusively for many comedies) aimed at that, but also some scenes made me laugh, and that he certainly wanted to. Considering that it was done according to real people and real friendship, I think that it gained extra weight. I don't know if this will become a classic in a few years, but I was delighted with the film and it was given the maximum rating.",

Viggo Mortenson captures the essence of 1960s New York City in his blundering innocence and assumptions of the world around him. Beautifully shot and directed, the movie is more than an unexpected friendship, it is one of discovery of the other sides of America.",
720,16 April 2019,inker-13614,9, Excellent,"I cannot believe I didn´t watch this movie earlier, but I am so glad I got to it at all. As I have stated before with other movies - for me a very important part of a movie is to make you feel something, anything, stir up some emotions and leave you thinking and debating on some things. Yes, this movie has all of that. It talks about imoprtant issues and gives a glimpse of different sides of humanity.
I do believe that the big part in the success of this movie is on Mortensen and Ali - they did their roles just perfectly, but I was especially impressed with Mortensen.
What is another interesting thing about thos movie is that it often seems like you can predict what´s gonna happen next, but that´s not the case and I quite liked that.
Also I just realized in the very end that this was a true story and usually movies make it pretty clear at the very beginning. But that just made it all that much more enjoyable.
When the movie ended I felt sheer happiness and gratitude that I had spent 2 hours of my life looking at an incredible story that took my mind to so many different places and made me feel in many different ways. I fully reccomend this film to everyone.",
721,2 February 2019,bbewnylorac,8, Good film with a good heart,"Director Peter Farrelly succeeds in making his first serious drama. It's not perfect but it is captivating and entertaining. Viggo Mortensen, always an under-rated actor, is wonderful as chauffeur Tony ""the Lip"" Vallelonga, who is from working class Bronx stock, and who has an amazing ability to deal with trouble as a night club bouncer. And as the very posh black concert pianist Don Shirley, Mahershala Ali is also great, in portraying an emotionally repressed artist, who during his tour of the Deep South comes somewhat down to earth. Both men have their eyes opened and have something to teach the other. Some of the characters' darker sides, such as Tony's resorting to violence, and his mafia ties, are shown, and not glossed over, which is refreshing.

The genius has something to learn about melting back into humanity from his 'dem dese dos' driver. Shirley was the first musician I was exposed to as a child, a 'white' suburb kid in the 50's, because my dad was into his music, and it influenced me. This movie is full of great samples and ends with a thing by Professor Longhair, whose Tipitina still gets me off. The acting is great. It's an interesting story, sort of corny but compelling. It's touching but never feels particularly manipulative. I had no idea of what an interesting character Shirley was. I just knew the music. Not stylistically, but he reminds me of Keith Jarrett, another classically trained prodigy whose talent went way past his early training. To people like Shirley, whose interior empire and life is music, it's enough for me to listen to his work. But a movie is not an audio recording so we get this view of the man himself. Apparently this is a more or less authentic view too. I hope so. Anyway, great movie.",

729,10 June 2020,dr_clarke_2,10," A great ""odd couple"" buddy movie with deeper undertones","Had anyone claimed prior to 2018 that Peter Farrelly - director of Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, Shallow Hal and other amusing but crass low-brow comedies - would one day directed a movie that would win the Academy Award for Best Picture, it seems unlikely that he or she would have been believed. Nevertheless, this proved to be the case with Green Book, a fictionalised biographical comedy drama charting the unlikely friendship between musician Dr Don Shirley and his driver Tony Lip.
The story follows Shirley and Tony Lip (real name Frank Anthony Vallelonga) as the former hires the latter to drive him around on an eight-week tour of the Deep South. Set in 1962, the plot sees Shirley encountering an entirely unsurprising amount of racism, as he is allowed and paid to perform for white audiences but not allowed to use their toilets. Tony thus acts not only as driver but occasional bodyguard, both physically and verbally defending Shirley from the prejudice and persecution he encounters along the way. But whilst racial issues are an important part of the film, it is as much as anything a buddy movie about a growing friendship between an ill-matched pair, the refined and highly educated intellectual snob Shirley and uncouth, foul-mouthed slob Tony Lip. The film's comic moments (and there are many) derive from the friction between their pair caused by their very different outlooks on many aspects of life, including - frequently - food.
The relationship between Shirley and Tony Lip is the very heart of the film. The success of this is partly a result of the screenplay (written by Farrelly, Tony Lip's son Nick Vellelonga, and Brian Hayes Currie) and partly a result of the acting. Mahershala Ali gives a stunning performance as Dr Don Shirley, making him incredibly charismatic, educated and dignified, a sharp contrast to the uneducated, rough and ready Tony Lip. Viggo Mortenson - who gained weight for the role - is just as well cast and the pair gives entirely naturalistic performances throughout. How true to life the characters and the events of the film are has been the subject of much scrutiny, but within the context of the movie they are perfectly convincing. There are many nice touches: the scene in which Don gets arrested during a gay encounter and Tony gets him released, later shrugging off the incident by saying that he knows from working in New York clubs that it is ""a complicated world"" is nicely understated. Some commentators have argued that the difficulties of being a black gay man in the nineteen sixties should have been explored, but Shirley reportedly never discussed his sexuality and it isn't the point of the film. The very fact that it doesn't matter to Tony is the point.
In spite of the humour, there is also drama aplenty, with real anger in the casual racism of scenes such as Don being forbidden from using the same toilet as the white men at the venue he plays at, and not being allowed to try on a suit in a shop. It's impossible to watch such scenes without feeling disgusted, both at the racist attitudes and the casual way in which they are prevalent in the places that the protagonists visit. The script addresses the question of why Don exposes himself to such bigotry, and having put up with a great deal on the grounds that he wants to change hearts, he finally takes a stand on the last night of the tour, refusing to play at the establishment unless its manager lets him eat in the restaurant.
Having spent most of his career directing what can most politely (but somewhat inaccurately) be described as screwball comedies, Farrelly shows remarkable taste and restraint here, with crisp, understated direction that showcases the acting and lets the characters speak for themselves. Sean Porter's cinematography makes an asset out of the location filming, reflecting Tony's appreciation of the scenery he finds himself driving through, whilst Kris Bowers' soundtrack is supplemented by tracks from the era, which works really well. Green Book has attracted controversy for its depiction of race, with some arguing that it perpetuates a ""white saviour"" stereotype; this is a matter that I suspect will be the subject of continued debate, but as a touching portrait of an unlikely friendship between two very different men, the film works extremely well.",
730,1 December 2018,darkreignn,9," A fun, feel good film","Let's be honest: the trailer for this film made it look like a typical, Oscar-baiting, end of the year awards contender, and in a way it is. We can't deny it - the Oscars love their films about racists turning from their prejudiced ways, and about people struggling through the atrocities of racism and bigotry, and this trailer just looked like more of the same; it's hard to get excited about a film when it looks like it was put together by a bunch of studio executives whose only thoughts were, ""How can we win the Oscar this year?"" But if there's one man I have faith in, one man who is a light in a dim, dark world, it's Viggo Mortensen, so I held out hope because if there's one thing Mr. Mortensen doesn't do, it's star in bad movies. And you know what? ""Green Book"" is most certainly not a bad movie. In fact, it's pretty darn excellent.",

736,8 May 2020,akcenat,8, Feel-good road-trip movie based on 'Driving Miss Daisy' formula,"""Green Book"" does a fine job of depicting the rampant disrespect that people of color were shown in the US during 1960's. Main problem is, as politically corrected movie, ""Green Book"" tries very hard and wants not to offend sacrificing the complexity of one of societies great ills in favor of script clarity. On the other hand, the film's effectiveness is especially due to the talents of the two stars - M. Ali and V. Mortensen, veteran actors who just do not ever give an inferior performance.

This film has shown two main points that how whites are behaving with colored from South to North and 2nd the understanding of human physchology by the lead cast.
The music of this movie was also very good specially the final performance by Dr.Shirley.
Mahershala is giving the best in every other movie.This would be his one of the best . Viggo was so perfect that I did doubt that how he differently performed in LOTR.

Secondly, duet of main characters is the brilliant of film. I think Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali played their best roles for nowadays.

I really liked the atmosphere of the 60s, clothes, cars, music, characters in the film. The dialogues are written ironically and at the same time filled with meaning for the viewer.
The film that you watch without stopping, although it is far from a blockbuster; the film, where behind a light comedy lies a deep meaning.

Shirley is a concert pianist who needs a driver and some protective muscle as he tours the prejudiced South during the early 60's. Shirley is too cultured to fit in with his own race but too black to fit in with the white one.

It has a warm, congenially progressive vibe and a wonderfully street line of humor.

815,26 May 2019,mohit_sinsniwal,9, Are We There Yet?,"We loved Green Book along with the sold-out crowd who applauded loudly at the end. Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is the movie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. Top all this off with a really good soundtrack, excellent direction and production values, and an audience that laughed out loud and vigorously applauded at the end...this one is a true 10!",

It is simply the same story but in a different context: two men from opposites worlds that meet each other because of working motivations, that become friends enriching themselves and growing through the film. Also the alternation between the humor and some touching moment is very similar between the two movies. The fact that ""The Untouchables"" was so surprising and great at the time is a clue that even this ""younger cousin"" will be that for the ones who will watch it for the first time.

Viggo Mortensen gave a stunning performance as the loud-mouth Italian American and Mahershala Ali as the cultured and well mannared African American ( For which he won the oscar ). I am a little insulted that Viggo wasn't nominated in any categories but hey... The chemistry between the two main characters was awesome! Goes to show that opposites does attract.",

The outcome is predictable, but the journey getting there is heartfelt. It is by turns dramatic, funny, touching and scary - as in how people were treated in the south in 1962. Last time I saw the horror of it on screen was in The Help.
Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali both give award worthy performances. In fact, I read that Viggo won best actor, and the movie was named best picture by National Board of Review.
It is a riveting portrait of how two disparate men found a bond that lasted a lifetime.

Green book is a lovely story of two men crossing state and personal borders and become friends. It's a story about racisme in a period of segregation, but it's told like a roadtrip movie.

The movie is not flashy and not one with lots of special effects, etc. Its a story. I also work with many races at work and I don't think I would ever judge another by their color as ability is what matters when you try to save a life at the hospital. This movie helps me understand what a few percent of out humanity feels and acts on.

874,12 March 2019,regina_m_ryan,2, A Whole Lot of Caricatures,"What is perhaps the most telling exchange in this ode to some mystical, post-racial looking back, boy to man story is that of the Kentucky fried chicken dialogue. When Tony consternates that he is ""more black"" than Don Shirley simply because he eats fried chicken and listens to Aretha Franklin, one can only pause at the absurdity of such an utterance from a presumed first generation Italian American to a African American man presumedly steeped in the 1950s Black Liberation movement. One would have expected Mr. Shirley to take a bat to the back of Tony's head with such a disparaged and, most certainly, historically inaccurate, depiction of American society pre-Civil Rights legislation, Pre-Voting Rights legislation, and at the cusp of a radical consciousness of Black identity still forming its sensibilities for the late-20th C. Placed in the context of American Southern apartheid, with a heap of hand waving by their Northern white countrymen, to suggest a white man of any ethnicity would gladly identify as more black than a African American man in the midst of one of the violent and consequential turning points in American history is not only ludicrous but offensive. The very script contradicts itself when later Tony assaults a police man in Alabama who assailed him with an epithet that for Mr. Shirley was par for the course. If this film is allegory of where we were a half century ago and all we have to look forward to now that we have freed ourselves from America's original sin, one can only contemplate how poorly we understand our own history and our inability to reckon with the utter failure of spirit that is American racism.",

To please Hollywood, they put in the part about Don Shirley being caught having sex with another man at a YMCA. According to what I have read, this never happened. It surprises me that Hollywood is so concerned about furthering the cause of the LGBT community, and about paying homage to the plight of African Americans in this country, yet they give the Academy Award to a film that portrays an Italian American man in the worst light. This film plays off a stereotype that insults the intelligence. This movie portrays Frank Anthony Vallelonga as a total idiot. That he wasn't. He was a very intelligent actor. If he were alive today, I am sure that he would object to his name being placed on this character in the film.

919,19 January 2022,gixeg-61905,8, Watch this movie.,"I saw Don Shirley speak in college in 1966. At the time, I just thought he was a damn good pianist, using bass and cello to create a unique sound. And when this film came out, I thought: ""I saw this guy!"". I know the critics are harsh on this film, but I sat there for two hours, completely engrossed. I know there are stereotypes. Maybe it's because repetitive anti-minority and racist actions have become so commonplace that they seem like stereotypes. I believe that the performance was made by these two wonderful actors. There is a subtlety to this film that surpasses many other films of this type. Yes, there are southern cops here; yes, there are men's toilets that are prohibited; yes, there are simplistic views on the racism of white New Yorkers. But what I got was a realistic representation of a developing friendship. Shirley is blunt and self-absorbed; Lip doesn't understand anything most of the time. And I believed in them. Watch this movie.",

I dont agree with a lot of the commentary about how it handled racism; and how Don Shirley was portrayed. His family did not write the film. This story developed from the writer hearing it mostly from his dad, the driver. So from that point of view the story depicted was accurate.

Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali worked this ""odd couple"" to perfection actually defining how the development of deep lifelong friendship is derived. Having seen the film tonight for the first time after hearing all the Oscar talk, it strikes me profoundly that the best supporting actor role was undeniably dependent on the nominee for best leading actor in this film. I think that both actors deserved Oscars, but not one. That is to say it should have been both or neither as the only choice. I don't get the academy's ambivalence, since they awarded best picture for the film. (Yes, I have seen Bohemian Rhapsody and loved the film and Rami Malek's performance.)

943,21 April 2019,browniesnack57,10, Dear Critics Of This Motion Picture,"Green Book is an absolutely beautiful film. It shows tolerance, acceptance and friendship, against all odds, despite all the arguing the main characters are doing. The purest kind of friendship, the unconditional, natural and semi-confrontational. Tony and Don's friendship happens purely out of circumstance, the fact that they are driving many miles on the road together, from state to state. I have heard that this film has gotten a lot of critique, and I'm not sure why. I presume people think it overshadows the deep problems of segregation by having it be a signle man, a musician, who is less affected than most other African-Americans in the deep south at the time. Frankly, I disagree with this complaint. The Jim Crow days of US History spanned not one, but TWO decades, and were wildly complex, I mean, if it wasn't, JFK would have been able to do a lot more than he did. And that's why I don't blame him, nor do I blame this movie. It's impossible to make a heartfelt movie about race and not miss details some people find crucial. I think, to truly enjoy movies like this, one shouldn't nitpick these films, but look at it in regards to the big picture. This movie is instrumental in bringing awareness, as there very well might be people who think like Tony, narrow-minded, but not with the intention of supressing or hurting non-whites. Simply because they don't quite get it. Here, one can get educated through seeing Tony taught lessons as well. All in all, this a wonderful, family friendly, hilarious film with huge societal impact. Recommended for everyone.",

979,15 February 2019,SweetWilliam63,7, Green Storybook,"'Green Book' is charming, funny and heart warming. Oh, and ""based"" on a true story. ""Inspired"" may have been an even better choice. So if your looking for historical accuracy, you may want to pass. However, taken for what it is, a road trip movie about two diametrically opposed characters directed by Peter Farrelly, it's a fun and thoughful story. It's flawed only by its inability to decide if it is about the characters or investigating a bigger idea about race then and now. There is no question that this subject, especially in these times, deserves better and more serious consideration but does every movie about race in America have to be charged with that duty? (This may be the fault of sloppy marketing that leaned into the ""based on a true story"" trailer plug. ) Having said that, there is a lot to unpack here and the movie gets bogged down in too many running themes. (Thus a 7 over an 8 rating) Mortensen and Ali have a nice chemistry. It'd be cool if they did something else together.

I already knew both these actors are very talented but holy WOW they blew me away in this. Their chemistry is so good and I hope they both win their Oscars. I really hated Viggo's character Tony at first but he redeemed himself by the end, and what a positive message to send: fight hate and prejudice with love and loyalty. Tony became loyal to this man because of experiences he never realized could affect him. His face when he hears Doc play for the first time... priceless. He decides to respect his friend's humanity first and foremost because we ALL have a choice to be decent human beings. It's a really wonderful change for anyone to make.

The performances by both Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are award worthy. The filming in period locations using vintage cars and fashions was outstanding. The story of the seedy ""colored only"" hotels and the overt apartheid of the deep South of the early 60s was revealed through the eyes and feelings of the pompous but educated and musically talented black man and his white Bronx-raised chauffeur. Both characters took a journey together for two months on the tour-stop road and learned great lessons about each other. There were powerful scenes throughout the film that left one amused and uneasy. Nevertheless, this was a completely unexpected treat and one that I would heartily recommend.",

1005,28 December 2018,matt_herold,9, I loved this film,"This is my first review posted on IMDB however I feel compelled to write a review because I loved this film so much.
Warning to bigots: you may not enjoy this film. Thankfully we don't live in the 60's any more where the vast majority of people (mostly in the South) were staunch bigots, however unfortunately there are still enough bigots out there. That's why films like this are so important to make and watch. Granted, the bigots who should watch it the most won't, but the rest of us can enjoy our evolution as human beings.
My words may seem harsh, however the film confronts racism and bigotry in its ludicrous entirety. No need to get into the plot; that should be covered extensively by the plot synopsis. Suffice it to say the walls of race are broken down unexpectedly and the result is a beautiful display of humanity when things go right (that is to say when race is trumped by dignity).
The acting is superb. This film gets 9 out of 10 because I don't feel it's the best film I've ever seen, which I think should be reserved for a perfect 10, although it is damn close. There's a lot of great movies out there and this may not be the best of all time but is absolutely fantastic.",

Nevertheless, it did so with unexpected and unusual insight, humor, tenderness and the birth of a friendship between two men that seems highly unlikely but beautiful in the end.",
1007,3 January 2019,cem-arican,8, GREEN BOOK,"Green Book is a road story, telling the relationship between a racist Italian-American bodyguard and his boss who is a famous black piano player.
Viggo Mortensen who is playing Tony Lip, the Italian bodyguard, shines as a leading actor. Tony Lip is an uneducated but a practical person. He can even eat 26 hot dogs for money or steal the gangster's precious hat and sell back to the gangster again. We see his racism in the scene he puts the glasses which black workers drank lemonade, to the garbage. He became unemployed when Copa, the nightclub he works, closed for renovation.
At that time the famous piano player Dr. Shirley (played by Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali) was looking for a driver for his tour to the southern cities of USA. He needed not only a driver, but a practical man getting things done in the tour program. He was well educated, can speak at least 3 languages, but his social skills is not well developed. He hires Tony Lip and the the tour begins.
We know the director Peter Farrelly and his brother from absurd comedies like The Dumb and The Dumber or There's Something About Mary. Even though there are many scenes that we have laughed in Green Book, we cannot say that is a comedy. Peter Farrelly made a good job with blending comedy, dram, road movie and even romance.
As a summary Green Book is a very good film with solid performances. You will enjoy every minute of this 130 minutes film. One more note, the film was based on a true story. After watching the film, find some Don Shirley music from Spotify or whatever, and listen him and his trio with a glass of whiskey.",

1016,9 February 2019,ShirleeDee,8, Great Movie,"This movie details the relationship between pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and a bouncer named Tony (Viggo Mortensen) who is hired to drive him through the Deep South in 1962 for a two month concert tour. He is to make sure he reaches all the concert destinations and to keep him safe if any trouble should arise, and plenty does. The acting is wonderful, especially by Viggo Mortensen, who portrays an Italian from New York who is a bit rough around the edges compared to the dignified Shirley. Plenty of humor is interspersed within the poignant relationship that develops between the two men. This movie is based on a true story when segregation was the ""norm"", and the Green Book was a travel guide for African Americans that listed hotels that were available for them to stay in, which were often subpar if best. If you are looking for a fast paced thriller, this movie might not be for you, but if you like movies that show a piece of history and true to life heart-warming stories, then this one is for you!",

They find nuance within their familiar types individually and share a spirited chemistry with each other. They are a joy to watch together from start to finish, even though you can tell from the beginning exactly how specific moments between them are going to play out by the end",
1021,9 May 2019,tomfeller,8, Feel good movie about race relations,"The title refers to a travel guide used by African-Americans during the time of segregation to find safe, friendly hotels and restaurants from 1937 to 1966. In 1962, African-American pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) employed Frank Vallelonga, aka ""Tony Lip"" (Viggo Mortensen) to be his driver and bodyguard when his trio, which included George (Mike Hatton) on the upright bass and Oleg (Dimiter D. Marinov) on the cello, toured the American Midwest and South. Shirley suffers many indignities, and, to a certain extent, Tony can shield him. For example, the trio is employed at a country club in Alabama, but Shirley cannot eat in its restaurant so he and Tony find a BBQ restaurant down the road. Other complications are that Shirley is gay and an alcoholic. The two men bond, of course. One of the funnier scenes takes place when Tony serves Shirley friend chicken without utensils, which Shirley initially refuses because he is a fastidious eater. Overall, this is the feel-good movie of the year, although predictable and rather old-fashioned, and the two leads are excellent with able support by Linda Cardellini as Dolores, Tony's wife. One reviewer described the movie as ""The Odd Couple"" meets ""Driving Miss Daisy"". It was based on a true story, and Tony's son Nick co-wrote the screenplay, which won the Oscar in the Original Screenplay category. Unfortunately, it has been a controversial winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, because many people felt that it oversimplified race relations in the United States and members of Shirley's family have objected to his portrayal.",
1022,1 January 2019,hubcap-83293,8, Surprising substance,"This film takes place in the 1960's. It examines the controversy of Black discrimination in a very unique way. Vigo Mortensen plays ""Tonylip"". A tough and rough bouncer at the Copa in New York city. He takes a temporary job as a bodyguard / driver for an up and coming concert pianist as he embarks on a tour of the deep south. Needless to say these two individuals could not be more different having come from two contrasting worlds. Thrown together they learn to appreciate one another and the life lessons each brings to eachother. There re more than a few laughs and many moments to ponder and reflect. All in all I highly recommend this film as something of substance. Excellently written and cast, a very good watch . PS the very last line of the movie made me laugh at myself. Tony's wife thanks Dr. Shirley for helping Tony with the ""Lettuce "" ( cash income). It took a few seconds to dawn on me she was saying "" Letters"" with a bronx accent .",

Editing is breathtakingly beautiful, script holds perfectly tightly til the very end(even when the credits role), cinematography is top notch, music fits the tone of the film very neatly.

To people who don't like ""Green Book"": it's a movie, and a story can be entertaining and meaningful without being a lecture. Two quick points: a. I'd vote for Mahershala Ali to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar -- superior work in developing a complicated character -- gifted, eccentric, idealistic, ambivalent -- and for ultimately being successful in creating pathos and admiration for the character in the audience. b. To highlight one of many excellent scenes (you'll know when you see the film): one of the best ways to fight racism is for the decent person in the room to have the guts not to deliver a sermon but to just tell the fool in the room to knock it off and to damn well watch-your-rear mean it.",

What a terrible shame for Viggo Mortensen that he was faced with Rami Malek's stellar performance as Freddie Mercury at the Oscars in 2019 (for 2018), otherwise he surely would have won.

We have seen a lot of films that deal with ""the Afro-American experience"" in the last decade, some of which have been highlighted by various awards. But Green Book goes beyond them, because it covers the diasporic standpoint not just from an Afro-American perspective, but also suggests that white Americans have a cast system between them as well. As we see in the film, Italian-American, as opposed to Irish-American, British- American or German-American, is the black of the white race. This is where the chemistry between Tony Lip and Doc Shirley is formed; Shirley is a black man who lives by the white standards and cultural values, but as we see later; he has been through a lot, he has experienced what being Afro-American means in this country, although buried deep; he still knows his roots. But he has ""whitened"" himself to fit the society; and in Tony Lip, he sees himself, and Italian-American, not much different than himself, the only difference is, Tony does not care to hide his true identity and Shirley learns from him throughout the film.",

""Green"" is in the dead centre of the spectrum and this film effectively takes you through it. It laughs at stereotypes and deals with shameful things from the past. It reminds us how far things have come and how far they still have to go. It leaves us with a poignant message that It's not about fitting in where you belong but more about belonging where you fit in.

Tears, laughter, mostly at the expense of Tony Lip and his brash, working class attitude to life. Superbly acted Vigo Mortenson was brilliantly believable while Marhershala Ali portrais himself as a self absorbed, holier than thou superior but actually turns out to be equally as flawed as Tony. The KFC scene was brilliantly played as was the scene involving the jade.

1065,14 April 2019,bock_g,8, Heartwarming,"This film has gotten a lot of bad press from the historical inaccuracies to it's controversial win for Best Picture-I have to admit I did buy into some of that press. Despite that however, the audience reaction seemed to be very positive (at least in Japan)-several of my friends recommended the film to me. So, with slightly low expectationsI I finally watched the film last night-it was pretty good. The performances (especially by Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali, and Linda Cardellini) were wonderful, the story was very heartwarming, and the music (both the score and soundtrack) were solid. Was it worth the Best Picture? Not really, far from the best, but I don't think it was an outrageous decision either. One of the controversies was the depiction of race- such example is apparent when Don Shirley, a high-brow black man embraces the low class stereotypes in the latter half of the film. I personally thought it worked in the film because the friendship and trust between the Tony Lip and Don Shirley changed the two men-both embracing something new. It's a typical buddy, road trip movie, not a historical epic like 12 years a slave or The Color Purple. Some critics and haters called this Driving Miss Daisy 2, I completely disagree because it does this film does provide a fresh take (A white working class man chauffeuring a black and gay musician) on the Roadtrip genre. It's worth the watch!",

But the level of fanatical racism this implies pretty much vanishes when Tony meets Don.

1109,28 November 2019,dircpitt,8, Ruthless and delicate,"A delicate and precious film, ruthless towards good feelings but hopeful towards racism that comes from ignorance and not from the heart, when in the end human solidarity is still able to redeem men and their sins. It is a film that perhaps we Europeans cannot fully understand (even if racism begins again to meander dangerously between our feet) but I like to think that the choice of an Italian American of the populace as a counterpart to the cultured afro doctor American is not random. After all, among the many ugly figures that the driver does, in the end he is saved because he truly begins to believe in his neighbor, because in the end he makes himself loved, because he begins to understand and participate in the harshness of the battle, because he contrasts and shares a fundamental value, that of the family, which we once had but which we are losing today. Because it is true that in life you have to be what you are (otherwise you generate monsters) but what sense does it have if to crown a successful life, on Christmas Eve we find ourselves alone or worse on the point of death there was no one to greet us with the serenity of an affectionate embrace? Another element common to films that involve some form of catharsis is that of travel, an ancient metaphor for the path of the soul. I sincerely would have given the Oscar to Viggo Mortensen, more and more an actor of thick cast in roles that makes him look easy but that are not easy. And as the protagonist says, it's really a pleasure to see the landscapes that are the backdrop for this trip.",

The scenario, the characters, filming, directing, everything. The humor was also exceptional. I was absorbed in the movie until the very end.
What's very interesting and special about this film is that it gives a different perspective of racism against Afro-Americans, because it talks about an Afro-American that had a completely different lifestyle. High class, economically successful, always formally dressed, performed music for the Western European people etc. Before watching this movie, I'd rush to the conclusion that he'd be very respected because of his fame and skills, but that was certainly not the case. There was prejudice about him from both sides: light skin colored and dark skin colored people. I had the impression that individuals like Aretha Franklin or Sam Cook wouldn't have to deal with racism that much: but maybe they faced it, just like Don Shirley did. Therefore, this movie presents everything from a very unique angle.

1151,2 March 2019,d-cisowska,7, Incredibly predictable and average,Another proof of how Oscars don't mean anything anymore.,
1152,6 November 2021,120watts,7, Well executed with good acting,"An enjoyable film in the mold of the unlikely buddy drama/comedy, with a core focus on issues of race and class; a period-piece from the early 60s based on real-life events. I thought the acting was quite strong and held the film together well. Sensitive issues were addressed sensibly and mostly poignantly (albeit more on the ""playing it safe"" side). The pace was also good, it never got boring.",
1153,10 May 2020,a-65018,8, Green book,A journey of reawakening in a Country like ours - Gore Vidal called it the United States Of Amnesia - the absurdity of the behavior in the Southern communities even the kindest ones have a jarring effect. Viggo Mortensen is sheer perfection as the all American Italian. The opening of his heart and of his mind is a total joy and Mahershala Ali provides another magnetic character to his already rich list of magnetic characters but what makes this film fly so high is the humanity that Mortensen and Ali infuse their characters with. I loved them and Green Book provided me with one of the most satisfying endings of 2018. It leaves you with the hopeful thought that perhaps we're not there yet but that we are on our way. Happy New Year!,

Two opposites in NY life, Tony Lip, the working class Italian nightclub bouncer from the Bronx ( Viggo Mortensen) and the world class African American pianist Dr Don Shirley ( Mahershala Ali) who lived in a flat above Carnegie Hall, team up for a tour down South. Based on a true story, the road trip shows us that opposite characters can learn humanity and civil understanding of another's world viewpoint from each other in an entertaining and humourous way, and survive the dangers, prejudices and stark reality of life in the Deep South in 1962. Go see it with an open heart and mind and you will be entertained and educated as you enjoy this tale of two men's journey towards mutual understanding.",

1165,16 March 2019,laredj81,8, The most beautiful films about racism,"If I was not white enough. If I was not black enough, tell me who I am!.
This sentence that comes in the middle of the film almost embodies the content of the entire film.
I was reluctant to watch this film first, because the American director Peter Farrelly, one of the directors specialized in the manufacture of light comedy. There is an implicit fear of a distinguished director in the humor industry that would be able to make a biographical, dramatic film. But what I saw was truly amazing. Farley has outdone himself here.
For the first time, I see a highly professional film dealing with a recurring issue in American cinema, the issue of racism that America had more than 50 years ago. A very clever dramatic adaptation of the famous pianist Donald Shirley and his relationship with his white driver Tony Lip, who in turn had a somewhat racist view of black, but who, as a result of his need to work, agreed to become a driver for Shirley.
On a long journey towards the southern cities, Shirley plays for the white class, when it feels the importance of its culture when it listens to a genius. the story of the different style begins between the two people in a very sophisticated manner, especially from Mahershala as Shirley.
Interesting dialogues, cultural backgrounds, and dramatic development by influencing the other. Explains the racist concepts of circulation.",

The acting by Mortensen and Ali is outstanding, and the rest of the cast is excellent as well. The performances are authentic and the directing is well paced. The costumes, sets, score ... everything was really well done. Based on a true story, Green Book is moving, funny, thought provoking, and, in the end, a heart warming story of friendship and family-the one you're born with and the one you make along the road.",

There's a clip of a white driver repairing a car for a black musician, and a group of hard-working black slaves in the nearby field stop to watch them. Another clip is the driver bribes the police to help the black musicians.

One of them is full of life and have a very different approach on things the other person is black and is so obsessed on proving his loyalty for white people with his art , doing that he become aline in his own community.

1191,27 January 2021,callumkirk81,8, Green Book,"Directed by ""Peter Farrelly"" who is mostly known for making goofy comedies gives us something completely different. Based on a true story ""Viggo Mortensen"" and ""Mahershala Ali"" make it real with ""Mortensen"" playing ""Tony Lip"" an Italian American and ""Ali"" prorating the rich, eccentric pianist/doctor ""Don Shirley. The movie takes place in the deep south of America during the 1960s and it's accurately depicted. The two main characters journey from state to state as their unlikely friendship begins to form. The film deals with important subject matter and there's some scenes that truly demonstrate the division between people during that time.

During a period in our lives when there is so much hate being perpetuated, this movie is a great eye opener. A very brief glimpse of the way African Americans were being treated in the eastern -midwest and South in particular.
I highly recommend this film. It is both heart warming and shocking. Don't want to spoil any of the movie for anyone.
Dr. Don Shirley was an Amazing Virtuoso. Born with a Savant talent for piano that only others could wish for. Mahershala Ali's acting and piano playing were remarkable. A must go see. Bring your teenagers. Its a great history lesson and great eye opener.",

Both leads are excellent, Ali as the snooty classical musician who holds Mortensen, pitch perfect New York Italian family-man, to very high standards as his role-reversal driver.

I'm still quite surprised that the direction was good coming from one of the Farrelly Bros.; but hey, he proved me wrong. The true heart of the film comes from the relationship of Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali as it felt so natural, comedic, and quite touching.

On the other hand, because of the fate of the association to become partners and partners. Don is an outsider in the eyes of whites, although he is a pianist, but because of his different complexion, he has never been really treated as a master by whites. In the eyes of blacks, he was also alien, because he lived an elegant life and never lowered his posture, contrary to the black public at that time. In fact, the Don in the lively atmosphere is lonely, he can not really integrate into any race, he is not black, nowhere to go, he is ""proud to live"" but humble to the dust. Tony- started with the mentality of working and making money, but when he saw what happened to Don, he gradually broke the relationship between employers and servants and extended a helping hand from a friend's point of view. The ""toilet incident"", ""suit incident"", ""fried chicken incident"", ""writing love letter incident"" in the Green Paper.

What impressed me most is that this play shows the social problems that have lasted for a hundred years in a relaxed and humorous way. There is no bitterness, deep hatred, no roar. Regardless of how the underlying colored people are oppressed but succeeded, the elegant non-white people can't integrate into the mainstream society, and the perspective is quite unique. When I saw it, I knew it was based on a true story, even if I knew that the movie was inevitably sensational, but in the social environment at that time, the friendship between the two people was still beautiful and touching. However, the film has some achievements, and it ushered in the tears and hustle and bustle outside the play.

1230,13 March 2019,12_Monkeys,10, A great film in its entierty,"Forget about analyzing a film in sections, talking about its cinematography or the production design, or the choices the director made to work with actors that may or may not have acted before. 2018 was cluttered with talks about films that pure and simply did not have compelling stories but somehow made it to the festival headlines. Thankfully, this was NOT this type of film. The fact that Green Book is able to cohesively tell a heart-warming tale of two men from different ethnicities who become friends in the early sixties USA, and somehow get the attention of even the most cynical of centennials, is an unbelievable achievement in itself. Add the fact that the script was inspired by true events, written by Frank Vallelonga's son, and that the director of ""There's Something About Mary"" was the astonishingly best choice to take this ship to sale, and you got something special. The film is funny, witty, controversial, and simply put: beautiful. And how about that Viggo Mortensen? The guy can go from Sigmund Freud to a hippie living in the wilderness to an Italian garbage truck driver in a split second, and you believe every word that comes out of his mouth. He deserved the Oscar for this in my book.",
1231,9 December 2020,JBTV1991,10, A Masterpiece Of Cinema.,"Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is the movie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. An Absolute Must-See Film.",

It touches those sentiments and emotions that are almost forgotten nowadays, like compassion, true friendship, solidarity, courage, and obviously love. This is an story rare for today's superhero and marvel blockbusters, it's about being humans, good humans. And what makes this movie really unforgettable is the acting from these two individuals that captivate the audience, and make us feel that we are with them all the way. Vigo and Mahersala are superb in their roles and regardless of getting oscar nods or not whoever sees the movie will understand why movies last forever. This one stays forever, it's exceptional.",

The film is very good despite this exaggeration about smoking. Again, I don't want to sound like that guy against it, I just think there was an exaggeration in relation to cigarettes. I'm not talking bad about the film, which is undoubtedly excellent. It would be unfair to say that the movie is bad because of that.

I agree with many other excellent reviews, the lead actors perfect, music great, story right on, although when I first heard the theme expected it might be trite. The only scene I felt a little artificial was the black bar scene near the end, but they kind of got away with it anyway.

1249,16 April 2020,taxicc,10, It's worth an Oscar,"The color matching version of ""untouchable"", a road trip across the United States, but also a human journey across race and color, identity and class. All the subordinates were respectful to Tang. Only Tony treated him as an ordinary person, gave him fried chicken and told him the real idea. It's true not to discriminate against him by not treating him as black. On the other hand, Tang was discriminated and insulted by other people. He always held his breath. The audience who listened to him could eat in the restaurant, but not as a performer. It was Tony who taught him to fight back, to speak for himself and to defend his rights and dignity. It's ironic to be treated unfairly in the so-called ""high-end and noble"" places, but to be respected and supported in the ""low-end and humble"" black bars. Genius is not enough. Only courage can change people's hearts. Since he doesn't think about your feelings, why do you take care of his emotions? Bear to push forward for a while and step back to make progress. Violence won't win you anything, but cowardice is always a loser. Only by confronting the malice of life can we defeat it",

We all know full well how bad things have been and this film touched on these things whilst still telling a true story and, for once, a happy ending. OK it was simplified and dared to have a happy ending but it was a great movie, superbly acted and made one feel good without forgetting history. To be honest the relationship would have been a great story regardless of skin colour. Why the Guardian critic only gave this 3 stars shows that glossing over the more hellish details and daring to have a happy ending was just not acceptable, one has to bleed more.

It hurts and pains me alot to see how world has been unfair to people cause of their skin color, faith in certain religion and those people who are different and inability to do something. People who gone through depression and mental issue also faced this kind of issues and it doesn't feels right. You can't over power people,treat them badly or make them feel neglected or disregarded cause you're superior or richer from them. It's not right, World not only for certain people.

The chemistry between Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen is charming and captivating. A very heartfelt movie, that somehow came in short, through the lack in the depth exploration of Ali's character.
A lighthearted film which manages to touch on a couple of topics without over doing it and will almost definitely have you in tears by the end.
A moving feel-good story defined by the chemistry exhibited by the unusual leads. Surprising at every turn and entertaining. Perhaps too conveniently mushy at the end, but overall a great watch.",

Tony Lip is a classic meat and potatoes family man who does nothing half, and dr. Don Shirley is the classy, eccentric and lonesome musical genius who is on a personal mission in southern USA.
The dynamic and dialog between these two characters are what makes the film so great. At times it is downright hilarious, for example, there is a scene where Shirley makes a saracastic remark about Tonys primitive way of describing food, which is super funny. The ping-pong between the two are great.",

This film is brilliant, if you get the chance to see it when it comes out on general release, go.
It's based on a true story, about an Italian American who is employed as the driver for an African American classical pianist on a tour of venues in the Deep South in 1962. A time when racial prejudice and segregation was rife, so much so, they were given a guide book of places ""coloured"" people were allowed to eat, sleep etc. And even though that sounds like it's going to be a gritty story, it was really funny too.",

1329,24 December 2021,minamiakiiku,8, Dramedy,"Peter Ferrelly's 'Green Book' is a 2018 American movie, whose genre is comedy-drama. The story was inspired by a true event where an Italian-American bouncer accompanies an African-American jazz pianist, Don Shirley, on his concert tour to 'Deep South'. 'Green Book' means the guide book that aids African-Americans to find their lodgings, restaurants, and service stations during Jim Crow in the 1960s in America. The one of the striking points of this movie is the representation of the characters. First, I was amused by the clear contrast and the conversation between the protagonists. For instance, the Italian rough guardian, Tony is repeatedly pointed out about his inappropriate behaviors by the sophisticated man, Don. Then what I found fun is Tony complains about it at first, however, he reluctantly accepts the order. There are the noticeable differences of the individual personalities depicted enough in the story, so I could understand the characters obviously and enjoy the interaction. This is a great and worthwhile movie that let us entertain the process that Tony and Don build their friendship, and simultaneously learn about how the racial segregation and prejudice were going on in 1960s, America.",

I am super glad that I did. I was captivated from the start to finish. The movie's narrative revolves around how two people with completely disparate background, educational level, and color of skin come to understand each other and become lifelong friends, fabulously complemented with a plethora of humorous scenes and dialogues, great music of piano pieces and indelible hit songs of the 60s, and a timely and needed message in this troubled era that we should not build walls around our hearts to discriminate and hate other people who do not share same skin color, culture, or ethnicity. The movie could have become overly serious or didactic, but the director skillfully avoids the pitfalls and does not try to needlessly expand the emotional effects.

The bronx accent of Tony Lip and the italian way of solving his problems is absolutly amazing - it reminds me of de Niro in the movie ""A Bronx story"". The music played is also something that's giving this movie the greatness it deserves - the way in which Don Shirley plays with his heart and with such perfection, gives you goose bumps.

1393,26 December 2020,wtfedez,10, Film of the highest quality.,"I'm so glad I watched this, this is a very good heartwarming film which I recommend highly.
The two main lead actors are a perfect choice and share a on screen chemistry which is endearing when it calls for and comical and amusing at just the right times to keep you spell bound.
Viggo Mortensen is so convincing as a overweight Italian bodyguard with sense of humor and a deep love for his family. And Mahershala Ali plays his role (and the piano) so well you really like the two characters in what should be a boring film that consists 90% of these two characters sitting in a car.
The journey isn't just a physical journey across a dangerous part of the US for a black man in the 60's, its also an evolution of both the characters outlook on life. They open new insights and possibilities to each other they'd never been close to revealing in themselves in the past and it really binds them in a friendship which holds true. In a way they both have skill sets that compliment each other, you have the Street smart Italian guy and the righteous courteous and kind Dr Shirley, they're both able to teach and nurture each other, and help each other fulfil their goal. Some of the racism the Dr had to endure was beyond anything we see today and shows what great courage he had in doing this tour of the deep south.
The storyline is well scripted, well thought out and excellent cast and acted. The pacing was sometimes slow, but otherwise this is a must see film and I highly recommend.",

""Green Book"" just illuminate such a horrible situation and the way it gets all of this is impressive. On plot, it is properly concise and detailed, it's how a biography goes.
The movie is excellent because it comes to ""change"". From Doc. Shirley bending down to enjoy fried chicken, to Tony respecting Doc. not for payment but for friendship. From police come to find trouble, to a gentle ""Your tire is flat"" ""Merry Christmas"".
Everyone of us should put down discrimination, for all god's children are born equal. Racial segregation happened, and it's still happening. But not just for that, interactions among people is what counts either. And, with a happy ending, it sheds a light on the road for humanity equality. It deserves to be a ""Great"" movie.",

A perfect example which shows that the best movies are the ones taken from real life. There will always be racism (at all levels), but if we, humans look inside ourselves, show respect and love to our fellow humans, we will get back same thing from the others. It's astonishing the fact that we are capable for both the best and the worst things. Let's try for the first.",

it's a diversion in Peter Farrelly's directing style where he has shot the 60s by giving it a charming look. Mahershala Ali's performance really worth an oscar.

It was a pure story of finding peace in one another and understanding what you once did not understand. It is not just about a driver and a pianist, it is about forming a friendship where others deemed it unfit. This movie was entertaining the entire way through and it shared a beautiful tale.

It is nice to see the development of a friendship between the two main characters Tony Lip and Don Shirley. Peter Farrelly also succeeded in subtly depicting a serious and sad topic such as racism. Despite this depressing theme, the film also has some humorous elements. Green Book unites elements of drama and comedy. It is a very warm-hearted film that absolutely convinces. It also makes you think. Green Book shows what friendship and tolerance really mean. For me, it is already the film of the year. I think it has really earned winning the Oscar for Best Picture. Green Book is for me one of the best films of all time. I can only recommend to everyone to necessarily watch this movie. It is really worth it .",

in this kind of movies we get to see and discover the depths and asspects of humans ,the association of different qualities in one human being -and even oppsed ones at the same time-, his ability to change to grow and his will to help or to destroy others .. i loved how none of the main charachters radically changed , they simply dived into the other's culture , got inspired and loaded some of that into his own existence into his own identity ..that's the real purpose of human intereacting indeed .. that's what makes us human ,the ability to be different to be accepted for that and be accepted as well .",

BUT He was really brilliant in this role (even if he's not Italian... :D ), the story was not ""overpushed"", or forced, but nicely showed two different world's meeting. Every kind of people can learn from each other, if opened enough ( even if the circumstances makes them), and nothing is just white or black (or ""half-black"", or ""half-white""...).

I realized it was Viggio but he transformed spectacularly to be the character with his weight gain for the role, perfect accent and mannerisms of the man with his gruff but heart of gold (and then some) man. A minor surprise about the nature of Ali's Dr. Shirley was done well and was not the focus; it was the racism and loneliness of his existence and due to those factors that you slowly begin to feel deeply for this self-made, reinvented man who creates his own existence out of the world he lives in.",

This movie points out the dark colors of the white peoples minds in treating black people. Even though they in some cases became higher in class than them in education, skill, qualification. Yet the skin of their color made white people think they cannot sit with us, they are inferior, they cannot come to our homes, they cannot eat with us. it is a journey of two minds learning from each other. Knowing each other made them point out their faults and both tried to change those faults and became a new person. this movie will make you feel like you are on a journey of souls and emotion and discovery and ofcourse, history. definitely worth watching",

1492,26 February 2019,brucedclements,10, A thoroughly entertaining film,I watched this movie on the back of its Oscar success. And it did not disappoint.. The story is of two opposite characters finding alignment in a troubled time. Mahershala Ali's performance is as convincing as a concert pianist as it is warm towards Viggo Mortensen's Character. Best film I have seen in 2 years!,

1495,13 November 2021,bradleymasonn,9, Touching,"That is the second time I have watched 'Green Book' and the second time I shed a tear over it. That is an incredible film of a marvellous story of a rare friendship during rough and unpleasant times in America that charms and makes the viewer immerse in it fully. 'Green Book' raises an important issue of American society - segregation - the sin they are destined to atone for even until now. That is a dark spot in US history, and there have been a number of films depicting it in their own manner. And so does 'Green Book'. Maybe not in a perfect way, but we have to bear in mind that this is a mainstream movie for the global audience, therefore made in a way to be comprehensible by virtually everyone. The film, inspired by the true story, narrates us about two men, Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga and Dr. Don Shirley, played by Viggo Mortensen Mahershala Ali respectively. Tony happens to be an unquestionable racist at the beginning of the film and considerably uncomfortable being a servant to anyone. Being temporarily out-of-work, he is hired as both a driver and bodyguard to accompany Shirley and his white bandmates on a tour to the American South, which was still segregated in 1962 - the year when the story is set. By following their trip, we observe all the insanity of then segregation policies.",

The white guy, played brilliantly by the actor Viggo Mortensen, is a really macho, anti-negro, american italian catholic who earns his familly's living doing petit crime jobs for the italian mobsters. The black guy is a bisexual, highly educated pianist who performs workdwide and decides to take on the hard task of performing at the racist South States of USA. He needs a bodyguard for that job and during the journey they discover each others personality and sterotypes, they change the way that they were used to see the world and finally become inseperable. We' ve seen this kind of moovies many times before and the message is always the same. Don't judge other people by the colour of their skin or by their education or by whatever. Despite the banallity of the message, it seems that our world has not learnt its lesson yet and a repetition is necessary. Besides, the performances of both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, are excellent. So it's a 7/10 for me and maybe an oscar for best supporting actor for Ali whose transfiguration from film to film is unbelievable.",

Tony is seen to be prejudiced and politically incorrect while Don seeks to refine his language and behavior, projecting his superiority. But both men have something to teach each other, as Tony tries to chip away Don's quixotic nature, which is a poor and potentially fatal fit for the Apartheid system of the South in the 1960s. Particularly memorable is a brief scene of Don, in his suit, staring out at the plantation filled with African American workers.",

In 1962, most black men still lived a hard life which was not respected by white people. Even Doc. Shirly, who was such a famous musician, couldn't eat at a gorgeos canteen and try on suits in the tailor's shop. Meeting with such bad things, he just showed his dignity to fought.

Bravo to the writers who dug deeper than the facts to show us that we can become better people even when we already believe we are good people.
Tony truly thought he was a good man. Donald was full of himself, but hiding from relationships because he believed he didn't fit into any one circle.
During their eight weeks of almost constant togetherness, both men learn extraordinary things.
The most obvious being racial barriers, but more than that, they learned to view the world, and how it ticks, seeing it through each other's eyes.
Ending with a friendship that lasted the rest of their lives.
Any movie that raises awareness of love and friendship is always welcome on my television.
Each character played their parts flawlessly. Tony's wife, Donald's cello and bass players, Dr. Shirley's home assistant, Emit. They all played off of each other's brilliance to make the best movie of the year.

All subordinates are respectful to Tang, but Tony treats him as an ordinary person, gives him fried chicken and tells him what he really thinks. Don't treat him as a black person, which is the real performance of non-discrimination against him. On the other hand, Tang was discriminated against and insulted by outsiders. He always swallowed his breath and kept a low voice. The audience who listens to him can eat in the restaurant, but he cannot as a performer. It was Tony who taught him to fight back and speak for himself and defend his rights and dignity. It is ironic to be treated unfairly in the so-called ""high and noble"" places, but to be respected and supported in the ""low and humble"" black bars. Genius is not enough. Only courage can change people's minds. Since he doesn't consider your feelings, why should you take care of his emotions? Take a step back and make it worse.

Ali had a better performance comparing to his other Oscar win and seemed like he really earned it this time. Viggo's only misfortune was Rami Malek being his rival. Otherwise his acting was also Oscarworthy. I can't come up with any downside to say about the movie but I have for the Oscar win as the best picture of the year. It appears to me that an other cliche took place and a movie about race discrimination and homosexuality took the Oscar home. Maybe Green Book is the best of the best among the other movies emphasizing on similar messages, but this award will always be a shade on it as some may wonder whether it got the Oscar because it was really good or because it was an other black/gay movie. It is a pitty because this time I really watched a good one.

1574,9 May 2020,Anamika_Shukla,8, Brilliant !!!,"A subtle movie that makes its points with action, showing us just a glimpse of what it was like in the southern states in the 1960s. The Green Book was a real book that Negroes had to use to find out which hotels would accept them and which wouldn't. The black person, in southern states, had few rights until the landmark civil rights bills of 1964-65. This film shows us some of milder white reaction to black people. Murders, lynchings are violence of all kinds was par for the course in these states. The movie does a great job telling a true story -- one that involved a high-ranking official in the Kennedy administration to bring justice for Dr. Shirley. The soundtrack is the worst aspect of the film. Only one song, ""Slow Twistin'"" by Chubby Checker is reminiscent of 1962. If the filmmakers really wanted to set the mood for 1962 they would not have used songs from the 40s and 50s and pretended that was what Americans were listening to in 1962.",

1577,19 June 2020,abishkgh,10, Green book is one of unique movies i watched,"First thing I like Inthis movie is very simple & attention taking bgm.
Second thing is the cinematography,Even though almost 60%of movie there is only Sherly&Tony lip frames are in such a amazing way it never be get bored.
In this story they try to feed who is good or who is bad which makes to think & be in world of them.
Expression of their friendship is great, because of this I love the emotions in the biopic movies.
About acters especially those main two lead roles I never noticed any acting there",

1581,25 December 2021,avantart-80244,9, An Examplary Story for Modern Times,"The filmmakers present a great story of social stereotypes broken through human interaction. Despite surrounding pressures and unjust customary perceptions on all sides of the racial spectrum, two people develop tolerance, find mutual understanding, and finally come to appreciate and share each other's views. They evolve acquiring an ability to look beyond the skin color and social status to become friends. Willingness to listen and understand, not force, aggression and humiliation made this happen.",

Viggo Mortensen plays great. The actor shows simple feelings and values. Friendship and peacefulness are embedded in his image. I've heard a lot of good reviews about the film. I agree, the picture is interesting. But I can't understand and agree with the genre.",

It's cool when important issues are discussed in a relaxed way. In general, such green books - guide books were published by Michelin! I love biographical films. The film is based on the real story of friendship between a talented African-American pianist and a simple pasta maker who turned from his driver into a friend. From the series ""they came together like ice and fire."" It is interesting to observe how the saying is - you can't judge by appearance..justifies himself.",

Why did Tony Lip take the hat? Why did the fight start? Are these all Mafia characters? Tony throws two cups in the trash because two Black men had drank from the cups. That part I understood.,

1593,13 August 2019,ahm016,8, Viggo deserves the prize..!!!,A very decent film but not the best film I guess. And tbe Oscar should have gone to Viggo Mortensen for his outstanding and natural performance. Well done guys.,
1594,27 March 2019,lestercram,9, Enjoyed the movie and issues it addresses.,Seems to be historical inaccuracies near end where Oleg character states that 6 years previously in 1966 Ray Charles was assaulted in Memphis. That would mean the tour took place in 1972 which would make it difficult for Robert Kennedy to get them released from jail as he was assassinated in 1968.,

The performances are great, the subject is great, and one of the screenwriters Tony Lip: D child's story even more beautiful, however, the film in the last scene, not Tony 's family members took part. The film draws you in its own atmosphere, and Dr. When Shirley's playing the piano, you're in the lounge, or when the police stop the car, you feel like the police are shedding light on you. In some scenes one cannot hold himself. Let's break our prejudices, friends, the movie is great!",

1608,25 February 2019,omeromi,10," One word ""MAIRACULOUS""","An amazing true story film showing that the color, race, cast does not define anyone's morality, knowledge or behavior.
The story is about a Black America pianist and composer who travels to the south of American in 60's with his Italian-american friend.
Writer, director and producer nailed every aspect of this biography.
Marvelous performance from entire crew not to forget Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were terrific in this movie.

1612,10 December 2020,emilylucia,10, A must see to restore your heart's warmth,"I can't express how much this movie means.At first when I saw the cover picture I though that it was gonna be a boring movie about two friends in the road, but u was wrong. This movie covers on so make aspects whose value we sometimes forget. It touches the theme of race in a very impressive way; it it hard and real which creates an impact on the viewer, bit also subtle and discrete which makes it a factor you learn not to avoid. It shows that oppression is a human thing by this i mean that unlike other movies that show racism and/or colorism, this one makes you see it deeper.that oppression can be done by anyone to anyone and at the same time that pattern are sometimes broken and that some things can only be unexpected. This movie taught me about dignity, something i had long forgotten about as rarely hear the word. It reminded me that like don shirley i should stand for myself and that that action has a value that speaks higher than other things. With tears in my eyes i finished watching the movie, the ending shows the true gestures of friendships and it is a reminder that there is good people there, it is really impressive to see don shirley out himself out there with the risk of being hurt time after times, in that regard i can only look up to him for I like most people lack that courage in the heart. To finalize, please give this movie a chance, you will not regret it, thank you for reading.",

Racism thematic is a bit too often nowdays but movie gets it on point. Viggo is tremendous and M. Ali played his role with his best. Perfect movie for family reunions and romantic nights. I give it 8 because movie didn't give anything new, nor from director nor from scenarist. Real rating is 8,5 (closer to 9 than 8) probably because of weak competition this year.

Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali portrayed their characters with such perfection and dedication. The movie had an amazing story with perfect background tunes for each of their scenes. I personally wished that the movie didn't end as I didn't feel like getting up from it.
