0,10 December 2003,Coventry,8," Yes, it's THAT good !!",I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.,/
1,15 October 2005,kylopod,9, Pixar's best feature to date,"I have enjoyed most of the computer-animated films made so far, ranging from Pixar films like ""Toy Story"" and ""The Incredibles"" to DreamWorks films like ""Shrek."" But ""Finding Nemo"" is the one that remains unparalleled, not because of its comedy or creativity, both of which are equaled in the ""Toy Story"" movies and in ""Monsters Inc.,"" but because it truly, more than any of the previous computer-animated features, reinvents the genre of the children's animated film.",r

When Nemo gets caught by a scuba diver and taken away, it is up to Marlin to swallow his own fears and find Nemo. The ensuing search and rescue organized by the him is a mass effort by swimming and flying creatures of all sizes and personalities, such as a threesome of vegetarian sharks, a fish with short term memory and an aged turtle, all helping him realise the error of his ways in restricting himself to just his home.",v
4,28 July 2003,MovieAddict2016,8, Pixar Remains the Best Family Film Industry Out There Today...,"Pixar Animation Studios has a very good knack for making thoughtful, intelligent and humorous family films (note that I didn't say kid films). ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2 and ""Monsters, Inc."" are some of my favorite family films; ""Finding Nemo"" isn't one of my favorites, but it isn't disappointing like ""A Bug's Life,"" and it is thoughtful, intelligent, humorous and incredibly watchable, just like the other Pixar films.",i

6,5 June 2003,lhseaglerunner,9," ""Finding"" A Flight odf Fancy","Remember back when you were little.you know, back when tall to you was about as high as a mailbox? In those days, Disney animated films (e.g. `Lion King' and `Beauty and the Beast') were some of the coolest things out there and were movies to watch over and over (much to your parents' chagrin). Now, animated movies aren't exactly the `coolest' things to see, but an exception can be made for the uber-hip Pixar movies, the most recent of which being `Finding Nemo'.",w

8,3 May 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9, What an outstanding movie!,"This movie is just gorgeous to look at, really the animation is just stunning, with the blue backgrounds and colourful characters. My only criticism is that although there are some very funny moments, like Doreen speaking whale(Ellen DeGeneres was born to speak whale, really she was) and Barry Humphries's shark, I don't think it is as laugh-out loud funny as Toy Story. Finding Nemo is definitely the most beautiful visually of the Pixar movies, I would certainly pick it over Cars. The music by Thomas Newman was just beautiful, and I always look out for this in a movie, and it was a delight hearing ""Beyond the Sea"" over the end credits. The characters are genuinely memorable, especially Doreen and Bruce. And who can forget the girl Darla, with the Psycho music?(that is really terrifying)The voice talents are very good indeed, especially Ellen DeGeneres, and I liked Willem Dafoe's Gil. Albert Brooks made a wonderfully paranoid father figure, and I loved the plot about Marlin's son Nemo being taken by divers and Marlin (a clown fish) racing to find him. That is simple, but we meet characters like the turtle, so the film is filled with fun, enough to satisfy the fussiest child. In conclusion, 9/10 for the visuals and the characters. Outstanding! Bethany Cox",r
9,5 July 2020,twpain,10, Great Movie For Anyone,Finding Nemo is a very good movie and is really rewatchable! The characters are great and the story is heartwarming. The film is never boring and brings constant laughs for everyone! I highly recommend this film!,w

11,6 February 2021,Alex_Lo,9, Pixars Genius,"A touching and humorous story. As mentioned in my review of ""How to train your Dragon"", for me a good animated film is that both children and adults can enjoy it. The animated film is less funny than other Pixar movies, but still fun enough for the little ones. And the big ones can enjoy a lovingly drawn father-son-story, finely developed figures and nice film allusions.",5

daily life though I know it's not real but somehow I am just mesmerised by it.I never think about what fishes do, do they study,do they really live in fear,who oppress them bla bla.

What makes these films interesting is the designs of the films as if they look identical to real life; now the creators have made underwater more realistic than ever in ""Finding Nemo"" where the waves of the water seem to have life of its own.",9

16,14 October 2008,g-bodyl,10, Another Pixar Great!,"Finding Nemo is a very good animated film, probably it's in the top 10 animated features of all time. The story is about a little clown fish named Nemo. He ventures out into the open sea while not listening to his father. He gets captured by a dentist and now his father, marlin has to save him from the clutches of the dentist and his ""evil"" niece. The story of the film is unbelievable. I don't know how a movie about a fish can be very popular. The voice acting is pretty good. The all-star cast did a great job voicing their characters. The music in this film is sweet. The music will lure you more into the movie. The song in the film is great for people who like music 40 years ago. Once again, Pixar did not fail in its ability to make classic animated films. Overall, this is a very good film. I rate this movie 10/10.",1

It's a story about a clown fish named Marlin, who swims through the vast ocean in search of his son, Nemo, who was taken by a diver for a pet. Along the way, he meets a blue tang fish with short term memory loss named Dory, who joins him in the search. What follows is an incredible adventure full of dodging sharks, riding with turtles, swimming past jellyfish and trying to go through other obstacles to search for Nemo, while he himself tries to deal with life being somebody's pet.",?
19,7 March 2017,zkonedog,10," ""Nice""","There have always been three reasons why these animated Pixar films have appealed to us all so much. First, of course, is the fact that they are just plain so much fun. Second, is that they have a message that tugs on the heartstrings of young and old. Finally, they are full of humor for both the target children and the adults watching with them. ""Finding Nemo"" is no exception to any of those categories.",r

21,13 May 2021,Sir_AmirSyarif,10, A delight from start to finish,"As charming as it is beautiful, Andrew Stanton (and co-director Lee Unkrich)'s 'Finding Nemo' is a joy, both visually and cinematically. It is a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that warms your heart from time to time. The sea is brought to us in such a memorable and unique way that there is excellence and beauty in every frame. Gorgeous to look at and utterly adorable. All the characters are vibrant with Disney charm, but Dory, the comic relief, probably one of the funniest Disney characters ever written and superbly voiced by Ellen DeGeneres. A delight from start to finish.",f

27,1 December 2015,Horst_In_Translation,6, Fishing for courage,"""Finding Nemo"" is an American animated movie from 12 years ago and certainly one of the most known animated films in history, not only because it is an Oscar winner, but because it solidified Pixar's and Disney's collaborative efforts that went on till this date. I personally see a couple parallels to the classic ""Little Mermaid"" from almost 15 years earlier. Of course, the film takes place almost entirely under the sea, but it is also about a difficult father-child relationship and about one part of that relationship in particular, namely finding the right approach to life and letting go, i.e. find a way that will actually help him bond with his offspring again. A great film for fathers. There is not that much memorable music in here, but also lots of heart, even if a crucial love story is missing. I'm not sure if I would call Marlin/Dory one and if I do, then it's still not the core plot of the film.",u
28,8 October 2006,faraaj-1,10, Amazing - really funny,Finding Nemo is one of a series of Pixar animation features made in past decade or so and is probably the best of the lot. My three year old watches the DVD at least twice a week and doesn't show any sign of getting tired.

29,4 October 2014,CMTiago,10, A cherished childhood favorite,"Having watched this movie back when I was in my 8/9 years of age, Finding Nemo struck me as a very funny movie and I, of course, loved Dory and her quirkiness. Over time I began to appreciate the emotional impact of the story and the detail that went into the animation process, which in turn led to the establishment of this movie as my favorite of all time. Having only been surpassed three years ago by Toy Story 3 (another Pixar gem), Finding Nemo still holds a strong impression on me, as well as remaining one of my top 10 movies and my second favorite animated movie.",v
30,17 March 2016,MattBirk,10, One of the Best Animated Movies of All Time,"Finding Nemo is Pixar's crown jewel and one of the best animated movies of all time! They create an entire world under water, it looks beautiful, but it also captures the scarier things below the surface. Together, Dory and Marlin travel the Atlantic ocean in search for Nemo and along they way they run into some of the most bizarre characters imaginable! The audience is in the same position as Marlin, he is exploring the ocean for the first time, just like us as the audience, and it is intoxicating. The ocean to most people is a giant, wonderland full of mystery and you never know what you will run into, and Pixar takes full advantage of that as we meet a variety of characters. ",
31,13 December 2019,acedj,10, Pixar has yet to top this movie.,"Long have I loved this movie. This is the story of a lovable, yet over protective clown fish and his son, Marlon and Nemo respectively. On the first day of school, Nemo is taken off the reef by a dentist from Sydney. Marlon sets out to rescue his son. On the way he quite literally runs into a Blue Dart named Dory. Dory has a disorder where she can not retain short term memories. The two set out together and hilarity ensues. This is a Disney owned movie so of course there are some touching moments as well as a happy ending, but the substance of the movie is phenomenal. The detail the animators put into it is fantastic. They also manage to squeeze in some Easter eggs, and not all of them are Pixar/Disney related. The great white shark is named Bruce, which was the nickname given to the animatronic shark in Jaws. To me there is no better film in the realm of animation out there, before or after.",
32,2 June 2003,saska-3,8," Thoroughly enjoyable, but the sum does not equal the parts.","Fresh off a viewing in a packed theater of kids and parents, my initial impression of ""Finding Nemo"" was that I had a great time throughout, but don't necessarily remember why.  The film is similar to the ""Toy Story"" pacing, in that we follow two different protagonists in their attempt to return to one another.  In brief summary, Marlin the overprotective father clownfish must overcome his own fear of open ocean to try and find his only son, Nemo, who has been captured by a diver and transplanted to an ocean-view dentist's office fish tank.",

34,6 December 2003,Dockelektro,10, Just right as rain...,"God bless Pixar. I am not really religious, but for Pixar, I'll convert. Because they are the precious few, part of the species of that rare kind of filmmakers who necessarily have to check out every detail, every bit and particle of their work, and necessarily turn all of them into sheer brilliancy. Today, Pixar has accostumed us to a pattern of quality beyond measure, not only because their work needs special attention but also because the technical part is only a vessel to something much important: a heart. And since every Pixar film requires half a life and half a soul to make from each and everyone of its founding craftsmen, the results are so exquisite and unique that no other movie can be compared to them. One may wonder about their ""secret"". No secret. Just real feeling and love to their job. ""Finding Nemo"" is the new crowning jewel in Pixar's flawless hall of fame, again a movie based on the buddy formula we love so much, this time in a whole new world: the ocean depths. And the prospect of doing a movie in this setting is probably something for the Pixar artists to drool on: just imagine all the quirky ideas they can have in this unexplored realm. And they deliver, big time. Once more, the filmmakers never opt for the obvious, delivering always the right choices, always turning the right way, and once more transforming all of us mere viewers into big children, just marvelling into the beautiful sights and sounds of the big blue. And they make us travel into all aspects of the possible journey, surprising even the most visionary viewer. The result is one of the most warm movies of the year, one of those movies that makes you come out with a smile and makes you forget about all your problems. If movies are a way to make you feel better, then doctors should be out giving prescriptions of Finding Nemo. Combining intelligence, entertainment and art into one is a gift that few have. Pixar does it a naturally as breathing. And once again the result is nothing short of amazing. Movie magic at its best.",

It's the best movie I've EVER seen, and I know I say that about alot movie, but I actually mean it this time. Never, did I ever come out of a theater after seeing a movie smile for the rest of the night. The movie just completely blew me away. I knew it was going to be good, but I had no clue what was in store for me when I saw it opening night. This movie is a work of pure genius. The animation is just beautiful, acting is awesome, the music fit everything that was going on. I could go on and on with this list, but I think I'll stop there. What I liked mostly about this movie was that it didn't lack anything at all. There was just the right amount of comedy, drama, suspense/action, and even romance. And it all blended together beautifully. This is why I gave this movie a full 10. Believe, me if I could give it more, I would.",

Mind you, I'm not actually surprised that somebody has come up with such a summary for Finding Nemo because it is a Disney production, and Disney is known for turning some rather dubious films, and stories, into movies that are actually quite suitable for kids – take Cinderella for example, or Hercules (he's certainly not one of those people that a respectable woman would bring home to meet her parents).

My three old year son says ""again, again"". Yeah, he liked it too of course and so my wife. The story has many original twists and plots packed in a solid and entertaining adventure trip. But the most I liked was the real special effects and the very clear animation that makes very believable that these fishes are real.

49,8 December 2012,KineticSeoul,6, It's alright but just didn't seem all that special,"I remember the first time I saw this Pixar movie when it first came out when I was in elementary school. I thought it was alright back then but nothing special. And didn't have the impact on me during my childhood like the movie ""Lion King"" or the first ""Toy Story"" did. Didn't think it was a bad film back then but wasn't enthusiastic about it to the point I wanted to see it a second time. Now seeing it again as an adult in 3D my opinions about this movie is still about the same but I appreciate it a bit more. So the story is about a Clown fish that loses his only son and he goes across the ocean with a friend fish named Dory played by Ellen DeGeneres. Who did a amazing job with her role, in fact her character stood out the most in the whole movie. And through the journey it shows what Nemo is going through after being captured by the humans but mostly shows Nemo's dad's journey with clever fish scenarios thrown in different areas. And the clever scenarios mixed in with different fishes is what drives this movie. Overall it was a alright movie and you can tell quite a bit of effort has been thrown into this animated flick. But it didn't really have that impact to make it all that memorable.",

52,14 July 2005,jboothmillard,9, Finding Nemo,"The very first computer animated film made, and by Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar was Toy Story, and since then we've had A Big's Life, Dinosaur, Toy Story 2 and Monsters, Inc. This was one of the most successful Disney films at the cinema to date. It is the underwater story of a young clown fish named Nemo (Alexander Gould) taken by divers and put into a tank. The idea is obviously his Dad, Marlin (Albert Brooks), and new friend Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss, are ""finding"" him. Meanwhile, Nemo along with new friends including fishes Gill (Willem Dafoe), Bloat (Brad Garrett), Peach (Allison Janney), Gurgle (Austin Pendleton), Bubbles (Stephen Root), Deb/Flo (Vicki Lewis), Jacques (Joe Ranft) and pelican Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) are trying to escape. Along the journey Marland and Dory encounter three sharks, including Bruce (Barry Humphries, aka Dame Edna Everage) (named after the rubber Shark in the Jaws series), stinging jellyfish, turtles in a current tunnel, including ""dude"" Crush (Andrew Stanton) and much more, but he finds him eventually, and everything's fine. Also starring Big's Elizabeth Perkins as Coral, Nicholas Bird as Squirt, Bob Peterson as Mr. Ray, Eric Bana as Anchor, and Toy Story's John Ratzenberger as Fish School. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and it was nominated for Best Music, Original Score for Thomas Newman, Best Sound Editing, and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.

It is the result of filmmakers and crew meeting halfway on this bridge and including aspects from both production companies and making it work.

And all in the first five minutes!  Throw in big, scary fish and tons of melodramatic search and rescue action, and you've got...a ""kids"" movie?? They don't know any better, so this becomes their only alternative at the theater, which in turn makes it three hundred million dollars.  Usually these family films pack jokes for the older crowd that only they'd understand to keep them awake, along with the kiddie stuff.  Not here.

The whole Nemo getting lost thing seemed kinda forced. An overprotective father causing his son to get annoyed and in turn disobey him which eventually leads him to get trapped by a diver felt annoying because all this feels like it could have easily been avoided. But then in order to enjoy it I thought it would be best to ignore that part and to watch the rest of the movie with an open mind. As the film progresses I find myself actually engrossed and enjoying the scenes as they come along. The new characters, Dory, shark, turtles, etc. Are introduced who are quite fun and interesting. The shark part was a bit unnecessary though. They could've kept it as a friendly shark or something, but the bloodshed was too much I feel since it is a kids movie.",

63,31 March 2015,sandnair87,10, An Underwater Treasure!,"Pixar's animation wonder Finding Nemo, is a shimmery, velvety undersea coming-of-age story which is aglow with translucent sea flora and gleaming, iridescent creatures. Australia's Great Barrier Reef provides a stunning starting point for this aquatic parable. Nemo (Alexander Gould) is a spunky little clown-fish with a slight disability - a foreshortened front fin. Nemo's single father, Marlin (Albert Brooks) is a dry, wry clown-fish with an excess of anxiety (He is also a clown who can't tell a joke, though he keeps trying to do so quite hilariously). Despite Marlin's suffocating attention, his small fry is scooped up by a scuba diving dentist and gets separated from his father. Determined not to lose his son, Marlin begins a long, arduous albeit seemingly hopeless rescue mission across the sea and soon bumps into an overly exuberant, sweetly scatterbrained regal blue tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). They search for Nemo together in the face of stinging jellyfish, exploding mines, noxious sharks and other irritable flounders. In the meantime, Nemo makes some very good friends in the dentist's aquarium, including a tiger fish (Willem Dafoe) who helps him plan an escape. From then on, it's a relentless journey of visual excitement and wonder, as the distraught father sets off to rescue his offspring and Nemo finds ways to escape from the aquarium. As is mandatory for a family film, there are plenty of life lessons for kids to learn, but they come sugar-coated with humor and fun. Meanwhile, a more adult undercurrent offers grown-up laughs, and there's even some old-fashioned tear-jerking to complete the emotional roller-coaster ride.",

On a technical level it is a masterclass, but it also provided a flowing story and a wide variety of characters that it was easy to get invested in. The story concerns overprotective clown fish Marlin whose son Nemo is taken by divers and he then purses them across the ocean. Along the way he meets a fish with short-term memory loss named Dory, sharks who have quit eating fish and a party of sea turtles. The film is effectively Marlin's journey and the colourful characters he meets who help him on his way, whilst Nemo tries to escape from the dentist fish-tank that he's ended up in.

I've always coveted the tropical fish tank with their beautiful colouring but never been encouraged to take them on as they're notoriously short-lived. This lovely animated feature showed me what I 've been missing as well as royally entertaining me too. The twin stories are skilfully inter-cut in a proper cinematic way, combining Marlin & Dory's ocean-wide search for Nemo is well inter-cut with Nemo's attempts to escape captivity from the evil fish-tank (now I feel guilty about owning one!). The dialogue is smart, occasionally funny, rarely sentimental and well delivered by the not-so-starry cast (and all the better for it - people like Hanks and Murphy hardly need the income after all), even if Albert Brooks as Marlin keeps reminding me of a young Mel Brooks!. The real stars of course are the animators, bringing to life, well, sort of, all manner of aquatic effects, from a shoal of fish on the move, to turtles riding the current and even the depiction of whales in motion. There's a light ecological message too as you'd expect, pushed just far enough to register but not repel, particularly with the children in the primary target-audience and of course the expected stuff about father - son relationships, growing pains, generation gap - can't believe I'm writing this about a movie about cartoon fish.

A few things made me smile but to me this is vanilla Pixar; there's a one dimensional story here, with little underlying depth, and the gorgeous animation is something we have come to take for granted from this studio.

My only issue was the lack of development for Nemo's friends at the dentist, we learn little about Gill and his crew, and their story does not conclude properly, which disappointed me. The voice actors are outstanding, perfectly delivering the personality traits and emotion of these characters as they struggle with this insane adventure, Albert Brooks conveys Marlin's sadness for his lost child, Ellen DeGeneres showcases Dory's amnesia perfectly and Willem Dafoe emphasizes Gill's desire for freedom effectively, as well as many other great performances, such as Geoffrey Rush as a helpful pelican.

The movie, ""Finding Nemo"" takes place on a father who tries to find his lost son fish, with the help of a fish with a load of short-term memory loss, portrayed by Ellen DeGeneres, which made me laugh a lot. Along the way, they encounter sharks, sea turtles, jellyfish, and tank fish. The story then explains a true loving message of father and son. Okay, I think Nemo is another personal favorite film from Pixar. The story felt true to life, the characters were all hilarious, including Dory, the best Pixar character ever, for most of the laughs, and the heart of this tale kept beating like it was going to teach a big lesson where to respect your loved ones, and taught the true meaning of father and son. And they use this true fact with talking fish! How cool is that? ""Finding Nemo"" was quite a story to die for, and the story was so loving and sometimes heartbreaking that everybody wants to see a movie like this! Looks like Pixar has a soft side of drama, and has a big heart for family. This is a movie that I can watch over and over again, and I'll never be tired of it.

Albert Brooks' character, Marlin, is very funny as the overly cautious (with reason to be) father. And Nemo is a sweet kid, who manages not to seem bratty at all even when he's being defiant. All the main characters are super funny (& endearing) whether in the sea or in the aquarium. Examples: Bruce & friends are sharks that don't want to eat fish (though it's hard to fight their natural urges); and Jacques is a neat freak, so naturally very bothered when they decide to let the tank get filthy in order to force the owner to clean it, allowing them the chance to possibly escape. However, Ellen DeGeneres' character, Dory, tops them all though. She suffers from short-term memory loss (at times, very short-term), which makes for many laughs. And she thinks she can speak whale, which makes even just stating that very funny. One of my favorite parts is when she tells Marlin that they're not the only two ones in here (the ocean, that is).

This group has always had a knack for finding source material that will give them full freedom in unleashing their animation imaginations (the toy-chest world of ""Toy Story,"" the insect world of ""A Bug's Life,"") and in ""Finding Nemo"" they take us underwater and show us the beauty, wonder, and danger of the sea. There are any number of jaw-dropping set pieces in this film: a field of jellyfish, a shark attack, a mass escape from a fishing net. As usual, Disney fills its film with liberal messages about the treatment of wildlife and the environment, much welcome and needed messages in my opinion. But great animation alone cannot sell me on an animated movie--that's done with the quality of the story and characters, and ""Finding Nemo"" delivers there as well. The Pixar movies are never as cloying as the traditionally animated films produced by Disney--there's always a drier, cheekier brand of humour, and you get the feeling that just as many jokes are aimed at the adult audience as at the kids. The voices are terrific, the story is quick and funny, and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing. Grade: A",

He is relocated in a fish tank in a dentist office. Merlin is joined in his search by Dory, a fish with a short memory disorder. They encounter a shark convention where the motto is ""fish are friends, not food."" They also encounter a slew of sea turtles as well as electric jellyfish. Directed by Andrew Stanton with wonderful writing and a creative eye for detail. Albert Brooks voices Merlin who senses failure over the horizon yet propels forward. William Dafoe voices the wise fish in the tank who is instrumental in Nemo gaining the inspiration to find escape. Alexander Gould voices the curios Nemo who is the symbol of disobeyed instructions and the consequences. Ellen DeGeneres steals scenes as the voice of Dory. She is without fear and looks at the positive even at the lowest moments. She is a creation all her own and DeGeneres makes it all the better. Geoffrey Rush voices a resourceful pelican.

Great voice work really makes this one, as both Albert Brooks and Ellen Degenerous do outstanding jobs with their characters. I especially enjoy Ellen's spacey character, that does not have to good of a memory, but is so cute in her delivery. I love the part where she takes her turn at the shark intervention. Great scenes everywhere as the father goes looking for his son Nemo who is captured and placed in an aquarium of a dentist. In the tank are some of the most neurotic fish ever, including one determined to escape the tank. They all band together when it is found out that Nemo is going to be given to the dentist's niece who lets just say isn't very good with handling fish. Nemo's father faces many perils in the quest for his son including jellyfish, a lantern fish, a whale, seagulls, and many other very funny perils. So watch this movie and enjoy as it is one of the better computer generated movies I have seen with great voice acting. I enjoyed almost every minute though the opening is a bit sad it makes up for it with great comedy...look for John Ratzenberg as a very funny school of fish and check the end where the flaw in the escape plan is obvious.",

158,12 October 2009,sddavis63,8, A Fun Underwater Adventure,"""Finding Nemo"" is a very well done movie for the whole family. Technically, it has the high quality of animation that Disney/Pixar are famous for, but what it also had was another feature Disney is famous for that hasn't always been clear in some of its more recent work - it's real, and at times sad and tragic, and doesn't get lost in the idea that children should somehow be shielded from the reality that sometimes bad things happen. In an opening that reminded me a bit of Bambi's mom being killed, when clownfish Marlin loses his mate Coral and most of his babies in an attack from a predator you knew that this was not going to be just a silly cartoon. In the aftermath of the attack, Marlin is left to raise his only surviving child Nemo by himself. Not surprisingly, he becomes over-protective, Nemo becomes resentful and in the end Nemo is captured by divers and ends up living in a tank in a dentist's office while his dad desperately tries to find him and rescue him. This runs the whole range of emotions - it's happy, it's sad, it's funny (the sharks who belong to the AA-type group - ""fish are friends, not food"" - are hilarious) and in its own way it's very educational for young ones, as the animation really does give them a sense of what some of these creatures look like. Ironically, probably the worst animation (at least in the sense of not looking anywhere close to real) was of the humans who periodically appear in the movie. Clearly, another winner for Disney/Pixar. 8/10",

The standard for both animated movies and children's films has been raised significantly. Emotionally and aesthetically pleasing, this movie contains a combination of separate motion picture elements that are interwoven into a brilliant exciting almost mini-epic voyage of discovering in a waterworld that breaths of life.

Look at Marlin, Albert Brooks' clownfish protagonist. In the opening scene, his wife is eaten by a barracuda along with all of their eggs, except for one. Marlin finds that egg and promises it he will never leave it, naming it Nemo. His journey is a testament to the catharsis and philanthropic imposition of chaotic situations, ones that happen within the context of the natural pitfalls of one's existential habitat. Parallel to his titular quest for Nemo is Nemo's own quest for the sanctuary of his father, and so in the superconscious of this deep-sea adventure, opposite energies are negotiated. Marlin's principle of orderly civilization, maintained by fear and the haunting wounds of his loss, is converged with the reality of messy nature.

Oceanography will never be the same because of the film's existentialism cinematography. Moreover, the screenplay of Nemo is in the school of the great Disney comical scribes. The acting voices were also primo! Albert Brooks as the neurotic Marlin was simply in the class of Fisher Island.

This is a perfect film for you to share with your youngest grandchildren although you should be aware that there are some frightening scenes that 2 and 3-year-olds may find disconcerting. Here is what our KIDS FIRST! Film Critics had to share about the film: ""I thought the 3-D was cool,"" says KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Anthony Aranda, age 10, who goes on to say there wasn't enough of it: "" but they needed to add more 3-D parts to the movie."" Fellow youth film critic Cheyenne Nguyen, age 8, was captivated by the cinematography and visual effects, sharing, ""The clear and crisp color with 3-D is magical. It feels like I am snorkeling and ready to touch these sea creatures."" Morgan Bertsch, age 7, thought that the 3-D makes all the characters really come to life. ""It was amazing. It made you feel like you were really in the ocean. Just keep swimming, just keep swimming."" The father's long journey from the safety of his coral reef home through the vastness of the ocean to where Nemo had been taken in Australia is fraught with danger and even earns him fame among the other creatures of the sea. He gains a sidekick early on his quest whose short-term memory loss balances the mood with heavy doses of humor. Finding Nemo 3D Reviewed by Cheyenne Nguyen and Morgan Bertsch See their full review on video. http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=XRhQ87qMeh0 Watching Finding Nemo 3D by Disney-Pixar is like you are snorkeling and looking through your goggles and enjoying the colorful fish and sea life. This story is about Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), an overprotective father of Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould), a clown fish with a defective fin. It all starts with Coral and Marlin, Nemo's mom and dad looking at all 400 eggs and trying to determine names for each of the eggs. Suddenly, a barracuda comes to the coral and knocks Marlin unconscious. When Marlin wakes up, the reef is empty; with no fish around, the only egg left under the coral is Nemo. Marlin becomes a very protective dad and will not let Nemo out of his sight. However, Nemo is the opposite of his dad. He always wants to swim into the unknown. On the first day of school, Nemo wanders off outside the reef and is captured by a dentist. This starts Marlin's journey to find his son. He swims as fast as he can and asks for help finding Nemo. The only fish that stops to help Marlin is Dory (voice by Ellen DeGeneres). Dory has a big heart and always positive. The only problem is she has short- term memory loss. The story line is the father and son love, unpredictable and very funny. There are so many punch lines in this movie that will keep you laughing throughout the movie. The clear and crisp color with 3-D is magical. It feels like I am snorkeling and ready to touch these sea creatures. I can see the layers of rainbow coral reef, several rows of teeth in the mouth of Bruce the shark, the pelican's beak, and jellyfish seem so soft and real. The best 3-D part is with the whale and the krill swimming toward the audience. I love how production and design make Dory velvety, Marlin and Nemo soft and gummy. The rest of the fish are metallic, typical scaly fish. This makes Dory, Marlin and Nemo more lovable. The sound effects of water sloshing and crashing are very realistic. The only part I did not like is what happens to Nemo's mom. Will Disney come back with Nemo reunited with his mom? The lessons in this movie are Marlin deals with his fear and swims all the way to Australia to find his son, Nemo, and he learns to have faith. My favorite character is Dory with her big heart and Crush the laid-back father turtle and his children. The message of this movie is listens to your parents — they only try to protect you and give you good advice. Parents are alive longer so they know a lot more than their children. I rank this movie five out of five stars. I give this film an age range of 3 and up.",

The first thing I'd like to cover is the perfect casting for the voices of the characters. Ellen DeGeneres is so perfect to play Dory. Her voice fits the forgetful fish so well! And it works well in the comedic scenes because Ellen is an accomplished comedian, so it makes scenes like speaking in whale hilarious. Albert Brooks is a good fit to voice marlin the clownfish, fits the overprotective nervous single father role well. And the script has such great skillful writing that it gives the characters hilarious lines when it's supposed to be funny, and sentimental/touching when the moment calls for it. The screenplay really did deserve an academy award nomination. The dialogue really gets deep with the character development. It's not just silliness, the movie really focuses on not only the father-son relationship between marlin and Nemo, but also on Dory and her being alone in life and finding solace and peace in the newfound friendship with both marlin and nemo. Animated movies that will please both children and adults like this one is sure to. It's got a little something in it for everyone to enjoy. It's hard for me to believe that there's people out there who still to this day have not seen finding nemo, but I'm sure they're out there, and if you're one of them, go fix this problem! See this great animated classic! 10/10!",

201,25 February 2004,valadas,7, Take your kids along with you,"These more or less anthropomorphic cartoon movies in which animals behave like human beings can convey strong moral messages while at same time amusing your kids a lot. Therefore it's very appropriate to take them along with you. On the other hand they can also feature animals (or some species) as friendly creatures ready to love and be loved and prone to tribulation sometimes too. In this concrete case we have an animal species not very often portrayed: fish. Which can also be nice and attractive like any other animals. I remember now ""Bugs"" another movie featuring a much less attractive species and which was also a good one. If you can make bugs appear as nice beings you can make it with any other kind of animals. Nowadays those movies are all made with the help of computers which makes them much easier to make without by saying this, belittling the directors and other technicians' talents. In this movie fatherly love is the main theme and you can draw the following maxim from the story: kids must obey their parents to avoid getting into trouble. A last word to the images and visual effects. Yes they are beautiful visions of underwater seascape and of the sea bottom, full of colour and fantasy. In conclusion I can say that I've seen better cartoon movies but also some not so good therefore the final conclusion is largely positive.",
202,11 September 2003,rdoyle29,8, superb animated film,"Stanton, who helped write ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc."", co-wrote and directed this computer-animated comedy-adventure about finding a very small fish in a very large ocean. Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks) is a more-than-slightly paranoid Clown Fish who is extremely devoted to his young son, Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould). Nemo is the only survivor after a hungry barracuda swallowed up Nemo's mother and her other offspring. It's not Marlin's nature to explore unfamiliar waters, but when Nemo is captured by a diver near the Great Barrier Reef and ends up in a dentist's fish tank, Marlin gathers his courage and sets out to find his son. As Marlin searches for his son, he makes friends with a friendly but absent-minded Regal Blue Tang named Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), a Great White Shark named Bruce (voice of Barry Humphries) who is trying to cut fish out of his diet, a beach-rat Sea Tortoise named Crush (voice of Stanton), and Nigel (voice of Geoffrey Rush), a Pelican who can take Marlin's search from the ocean to dry land. ""Finding Nemo""'s impressive voice cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Allison Janney, Eric Bana, Stephen Root, Brad Garrett, and Bruce Spence. 	""Finding Nemo"" is a superb achievement on three distinct levels. First, the look of the film is gorgeous. The Pixar crew has created a fully realized underwater world. The colors are bright and entrancing, while the movement of the fish is so realistic that the viewer never for a second suspends disbelief. The story is beautifully structured. After establishing the relationship between Marlin and Nemo, the film sets up the separate worlds they each inhabit (the ocean and the fish tank). The screenwriters have dreamed up creative plot points, formulating exciting obstacles (like the wrecking of a filtration system, a dangerous jellyfish zone, and a fish-killing eight-year-old) that allow the film to maintain an exciting pace without sacrificing character or humor. Each member of the cast appears to have been hired for their skills as a performer more than for their name recognition. Brooks, DeGeneres, and Dafoe all communicate real emotional truth in their characters, while such talented vocal performers as Root, Rush, and Humphries lend pitch-perfect comedic support. ""Finding Nemo"" is an inventively written, gorgeously drawn, and perfectly acted animated film.",

There are portions of this movie that are as inspired as any Disney entry, including the Dory character, the aquarium scenes and the EAC turtles. But I found some other parts tired or forced (particularly the sharks), and generally feel like they were working too hard to pad this out to a 100 minute running time.

In fact, disregarding 'A Bugs Life' I think it is the worst collaboration between Pixar and Disney. While watching the film, I felt that the emotional depth of the events could have been explored a lot more and I also felt that the film was not as funny as other animated films I've seen. To be honest, I felt that there wasn't that much magic around this time. I found Dory to be the most annoying fish ever (I can safely say that she wasn't funny 5 % of the time and annoying 95%) and frankly I felt that the other characters weren't too good either. I mean I liked Nemo and Gill and I thought everything with Crush in it was pretty cool, but in the end I felt that the majority of the characters just were NOT likable and cute enough. Also the film seemed to suffer from the lack of a true villain. All in all, this is an entertaining film, your kids will truly enjoy, but as far as adults are concerned, this one might have fared better if there would have been more magic, better characters and maybe even a shorter running time. Not the MUST-SEE it is made out to be and certainly not one of Disney's best. Well certainly it won an Oscar, but hey, when was the last time THAT meant something, not to mention that from what I've heard there wasn't much competition (as in ""the other 2!!! films had even less quality).",

231,15 April 2011,flyingamon,9, This is just a winner in every way.,"I have to think really hard to find anything bad to say about this movie. I guess the only thing I didn't like was the beginning where the mother of Nemo died (which we thankfully don't get to see but it's very obvious it happens). The story is a typical one where a parent is overprotective (in this case Nemo's dad) of its kid causing the kid to get rebellious and of course gets in trouble. The difference here is that it doesn't consider humans but fish. Although it's hard to find sympathy for Marlin (Nemo's dad) as he is sooooo serious and always talking, you get to admire him as the movie goes on for being so brave. Very good there is Dory, the girl who seems to forget things so easily that it actually becomes cute and funny.

There are good Pixar films, like ""Cars"" and ""The Incredibles"", but I don't think that it deserves to rank the 2nd best Disney film ever behind only The Incredibles. Now, they also leave out ""Pinocchio"", ""Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs"", ""Dumbo"", ""Bambi"", and other classics created during Disney's life.

246,26 January 2011,EricVierthaler92,6, Overrated,"I don't hate this movie but it's not as perfect as everybody says it is. When I first saw it I loved it but looking back on it, it just doesn't hold up to me as it did before. I can understand why Marlin is so over protective over his son because he lost his wife and other kids. But for one Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) was annoying. A lot of people say that Dory is funny but I disagree I thought she was irritating. I just wanted to strangle her. She kept on forgetting everything. At around the end of the movie she says to Marlin (Nemo's dad) that she ""Remembers stuff whenever she's around her"" Um I have to call BS on that because the only thing she could remember was Sydney and she couldn't remember anything else. And the sharks. The sharks are hypocrites. They say that ""Fish are friends! Not food!"" but you clearly see a shark with fish bones in its mouth. That's really hypocritical! Sometimes Marlin got annoying with how overprotective he was. I mean god I thought Simba was over protective in Lion King 2 but Marlin tops him! The music in the movie is nothing special. You might think that I hate this movie because of the negative things I have said about it no I don't hate it. I liked the turtles, the birds that repeatedly said ""Mine!"", the main character that was a bird that helped Marlin and Dory. The plot was good enough to keep me interested but as I have said, it's overrated. Doesn't top Toy Story 1-3. So I give Finding Nemo a 6 out of 10.",

Finding Nemo may soon be the highest grossing animated movie ever, simply because it's easy to look at. It's not as good as Pixar's other movies because it lacks the one key ingredient that made Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. work so well. Most kids never feared of being taken away by a man and being put into a fish tank in a dentist's office. However, I don't think there's a child alive who never thought that their toys moved when they weren't there or that there were monsters in the closet.

Other memorable characters include Bruce, Anchor and Chum, the trio of sharks, and Crush the sea turtle.

259,28 September 2022,TheHonestCritic,10, This is one of the best CGI animated films in cinema. How does it hold up today? Check out my review below!,"""Finding Nemo"" (2003), ever since the first teaser trailer came out for this movie, I was beyond eager to see it. During that time in my life, I just so happened to be obsessed with the ocean and sea creatures. You can only imagine my excitement! Right? Well, the day finally came for it's theatrical release and my hype was overwhelming. Sure enough, it exceeded all of my expectations, and then some. It even managed to find a spot on my top ten all-time favorite CGI animated films list! How about that? To this day, whenever I watch it on DVD, or on TV, I get the same excitement as I did when I originally saw it in the theater. Every single time! That's how you know when a movie is a winner. ""Finding Nemo"" has a perfect story, perfect voice acting, stunning animation and a great soundtrack. The plot is, a young clownfish named Nemo accidentally gets captured by scuba divers and it's up to his nervous and overprotective father to seek him out and rescue him. Looking at the synopsis as an adult, one may think that it may be a little too basic. That being said, the simplicity of the story is one of the biggest reasons why it works so brilliantly. It may be classified as an adventure film, but at the same time, it also has a seamless blend of comedy. Therefore, all the jokes and humor stands out and is one of the highlights. Once the storyline gets going, you're immediately intrigued and eager to see what happens next. I won't go into any extra details about the plot. But, let me assure you, it's a story you'll remember for the rest of your life. Like most other Pixar movies, ""Finding Nemo"" is full of heart and charm. To be honest, the more I watch it, the more I enjoy it. This is one of those films where if it happens to be on TV, I find an excuse to stop what I'm doing and watch it. How about that? One final thing I'd like to point out, is the gag with the seagulls. Every seagull yells: ""MINE! MINE! MINE! MINE!"" Whoever wrote that, give them a raise! To be honest, that's one of my top ten funniest recurring gags in any animated film. To tell you the truth, if you were to translate seagull voices to English, that's most likely what they'd be saying; ""MINE!"" Just typing about it is making me laugh out loud. Bottom line, the story here is one of those rare ones that will appeal to people of all ages. Although, to be fair, I think I enjoy it even more as an adult. It's the epitome of timeless and absolutely holds up to this day! As for the voice acting, it's just as flawless as the plot. All of the cast members nail their respectable character(s), and then some. The voice cast is exceptional and they really help bring their characters to life. Their exceptional performances make you personally care about the characters, and want them all to succeed in the end. For example, Albert Brooks does a phenomenal job as Marlin, Ellen DeGeneres is hilarious as Dory, Alexander Gould nails it as Nemo, etc. The whole voice cast provides such impeccable chemistry and makes the movie all the more special. As for the animation, it's beyond gorgeous. It's stunning to look at, and it's so appealing to view on any screen. Here's a little fun fact for you all, when Pixar did their original test animations for the film, they did a side-by-side comparison between their animation and an actual underwater shot of the ocean. They couldn't tell the difference! So, they had to dial it back and make it look less realistic. How ironic! Even though they dialed down the animation, it still looks phenomenal. In my opinion, it's easily one of the most beautifully animated movies in the history of cinema. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Thomas Newman is outstanding. His film score for this movie sets the absolute perfect tone for the storyline. Most of the soundtracks he writes and composes are incredible and this one is no exception. Props to you, Thomas Newman! ""Finding Nemo"" is a CGI animated masterpiece, and is without question one of the absolute best CGI animated films of all-time. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Finding Nemo"", what are you waiting for? Go and check it out today, I insist! I promise that you won't be disappointed. Watch it as soon as possible, or you'd better be on the lookout for sharks!",

It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.,
275,6 September 2015,shani_dayo,6, I am being honest,"I will not say this film was excellent, and I will not say it was plain awful either. It was somewhere in the middle for Me, it is a cute family film if You have Young kids, but it is missing something. The beginning is everything, it can make or break a film, now the start to finding Nemo set the tone for the movie and served it's purpose well. The movie had nice points but at times became boring and seemed to drag on, leaving Me wishing that I could skip on to the good parts. Basically this Male clownfish has a wife in the beginning with dozens of newborn eggs who will develop into little fish, a large creature comes attacks the family, knocks Him out, kills His wife, and all of His eggs but one, Nemo His Son who He will become protective off. Then We see how Nemo becomes a energetic but hardheaded child and get's into trouble, even landing Him in a situation were He is taken by Man and dropped in a fish tank. His Dad searches for Him like any parent would, and He runs into a few new friends on the way, including an unintelligent Female fish named Dori. After this, a bunch of foolishness they find the kid and the end...yay? Anyway the movie is short of heartfelt and emotional, just simply to keep Your 5-8 year old kid's attention. It can teach You to keep going in life though, I will give it that. I have seen better, but then again I have also seen worse. It is a pretty simple non-complex storyline that is easy to follow, but doesn't leave You with anything to think about. I have high standers for Kid's film actually, I believe they should be given quality movies and life lessons because they are our youth and the future, not just any mindless old thing. It's okay to have a comedy once in a while that is funny hahaha, but this movie just isn't it and leaves a lot to be desired. It is just plain flat and stale for Me, in no way a classic, or something I will remember for years to come. I would say let Your little kids watch the movie, older ones may not enjoy it.",

280,21 September 2012,kgprophet,7, 3D Version Worth Catching,"This review is specifically for the 3D re-release. There are two things that I observed, one was that the strength of story and surprise is about double the effort compared to recent Pixar releases. ""Brave's"" story felt relatively simplistic, ""Cars 2"" offered no depth. ""Toy Story 3"", while having depth, was still basically a rehash of TS2. ""Finding Nemo"" exceeds expectations every few minutes. Once the story seems set, a new wrinkle is thrown in. I had not watched the movie in a while, and I forgot how fast-paced and action-packed the story is. There are many more moments of genuine humour compared to recent Pixar releases. ",

I have finally seen this film after much hype and I have to confess to being a little disappointed; whilst the animation is truly spectacular, the plot is flimsy and the characters (on the whole) lack genuine depth. Of course there are places where you will laugh aloud but the humour is too visual to be truly funny and the schmaltzy sentimentality that seems to pervade 90% of all children's films now made cannot be escaped from here either. To be honest, Dory is a 'one-joke' fish and the surfer-dude gag is lame horse, overdone in comedy to the point of boredom. That said, Albert Brookes is fantastic as Nemo's father and I loved the cameos from Willem Dafoe and Barry Humphries. I was expecting more - 7/10.",

Albert Brooks is the voice of the phobic father and it's a perfect fit, so much so it seems to have been designed around his persona--he's quite clearly part of the creative process and makes it as personal for him as it does for Andrew Stanton, the director (who also developed the story). It's in perfect harmony with Brooks' body of work as a filmmaker, showcasing his desire for familial overprotection that was at the heart of his `Mother' (but with none of the smug self-righteousness that marred it). His Marlin is joined on his journey by a hilarious Ellen DeGeneres as a short-term memory-challenged bluefish named Dory and she brings the simple verbal vaudeville of Gracie Allen in endearing herself to the audience. We've become quite accustomed to Pixar's dazzling visuals and this film is no exception, with its exquisite painter's palette of sea colors (particularly the shimmering, watery shades of teal and the sharp pastels that comprise the landscape) but the story is the design's equal, a balanced, clear-eyed view of father-son relationships and the recognition of personal growth by one another--it's moving and meaningful at the same time.",

I'm in the latter category and as such, I have to say that this was perhaps the most boring and vapid film I have ever watched. For me, watching replicas of family, school life, dentists' offices, etc. without some sort of commentary just isn't interesting. And no, beautiful animation is not enough. So maybe we need to revisit the eighteenth century, when people -- Americans included -- were proud to think, question, and use reason in their everyday existence. Maybe that would produce an animated film that would allow Nemo and his dad to move beyond platitudes, tell the audience something new, and actually be funny (jokes in the Eisenhower era were funnier than this film).

There are some very fun and great characters which brings me to the only problem I have with this movie. There are too many minor characters, I would have really loved to see some of the characters getting a bigger role with some more importance to the story instead of meeting character after character that are only on screen for no more than 5 minutes (such as the sharks). Sure it's good for the sense of adventure but it leaves some missed opportunities to make the story even more fun. I think it's pretty obvious that the story is inspired on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy since it uses lot's of elements from it and it has the some feeling of adventure and excitement so it's really not a big thing that the story isn't very original, the original and fun way the story is told in compensates for this.

Beginning with `Toy Story' in 1995, followed by `Toy Story 2,' `A Bug's Life,' `Monsters, Inc. ' and now `Finding Nemo.' `Finding Nemo' is not as original or as creative as `Monsters, Inc.,' however, the film is extremely enjoyable as it is filled with lovable characters that will charm and amuse everyone. Speaking from a computer animated standpoint, it's the greatest achievement visually that the two companies have brought us. 	`Finding Nemo' tells the story of Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clown fish that has left his coral reef home in search for his lost son, Nemo (Alexander Gould). Along his trek through the ocean, Marlin meets several humorous characters-one in particular, a fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). Dory isn't like other fish. She suffers from short-term memory loss. As such, her flaw brings about some of the film's most comical parts as she consistently forgets her name, who she's with and where she is going.",

Perhaps this is a little heavy considering it's a children's movie but I have seen many children films and there a lots that I can watch over and over again. Alice in Wonderland, the Jungle Book, etc. The biggest flaw,someone else mentioned it earlier,is the non-stop intense action sequences. The film begins with Nemo's mother being eaten by a barracuda, for any kid who understands the context this must be terrifying, it's followed by another excruciating scene when Nemo is scooped up by divers. Anyone with separation anxiety will have trouble with this scene. Accompanying this are an assortment of loud banging noises, intense thuds, and Psycho inspired music. Then there are the characters Nemo's okay, but his Dad is a whining, irritating jerk, Dory is funny for a while but then her stupidity becomes annoying.

371,11 September 2016,datautisticgamer-74853,8, Nemo... or omen?,"Finding Nemo is one of those films that defined animation in the 2000's, showcasing the rendering power of the highly advanced computers that were now capable of making more realistic CGI than ever before. With the help of that, the animation is unmatched by any other CGI-based movie in 2003 and even seems strong by 2016 standards with its color and character designs (despite some anatomical errors, such as giving the whale an uvula). Add that to the acting that gives the characters clear personalities and makes them consistently likable, memorable, and relatable. With the combination of adventure/mystery with ""romance"" (Marlin and Nemo trying to develop their relationship as father and son), we get a story that is very well organized despite its complexity. Its drama and humor are quite hit-and-miss, however, as sometimes those scenes happen too fast or deviate too far from the main story for someone to stay that way when the movie is like ""this scene is over, let's go back to the story now."" Like how Dory is, however, we can easily forget those scenes and stick to what everyone takes away from it. It is somewhat inappropriate for families of very young children because it does get loud and mortifying at times (not to mention darkness, such as the death of Coral and Marlin's 399 unnamed children, and the unconfirmed fate of the Tank Gang), so I wouldn't recommend this to toddlers. For everyone else, though, I recommend a view by almost all means. (For those who are curious about the title, I was poking at how Nemo is the reverse of omen, which could also function as foreshadowing or worries that this wasn't a good movie)",

This film has the emotional elements of a holocaust film with overtones of horror film. They should have named it ""instant nightmare in a film can"". This is, by far, the most emotionally brutal cartoon I have ever seen and the fact that it was marketed as a kids movie is unbelievable! The movie begins when an entire family of fish (with the exception of the father and one of his sons) is slaughtered by what looks like a barracuda. When the son (Nemo) goes on a school field trip, he almost does something stupid because of peer pressure. His father then threatens to take him out of school, to which Nemo replies by doing the something markedly stupider out of spite, resulting in his being captured by a diver and taken away in a boat. The father spends the rest of the movie following the direction the boat went when it disappeared. During his journey the father finds another fish with which he can have emotional issues and repeatedly encounters creatures that are introduced in a horrific enough fashion so that it probably kept hundreds of children's beds wet for weeks after the film's premier. The combination of the odious, depressing characters and the slasher-film style directing/music that most of the film seems to possess culminates in producing wastebasket fodder even more potently un-watchable than The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005).",

We also get a lesson in life from a very special blue tang fish. Just keep swimming. It was very sad at the beginning when that barracuda ate Marlin's wife Coral and all their babies except for Nemo of course and Nemo had a damaged fin which is very small. Ever since then Marlin became very overprotective of Nemo and Nemo became mad with him and swims out into the open ocean to this boat and was taken by these divers and he's taken to this fish tank in a dentist office in Sydney, Australia. There Nemo meets an interesting group of fish including this fish named Gill who tried to get out of the dentist office so many times. We also kind of know the origin how he got that scar on his side and fin. Meanwhile Marlin meets this blue tang fish named Dory who suffers from short term memory loss and they run into sharks named Bruce, Anchor and Chum who were vegetarians until Bruce goes savage after smelling Dory's blood and then Marlin and Dory run into this angler fish and they soon learn the location of where Nemo is after reading the address on the strap of the divers mask and then get directions from a school of fish who do impressions and then go over a trench and bounce through a forest of jellyfish. Then they go through the East Australian Current riding with a group of sea turtles and then go inside a whale and get all the way to Sydney. Meanwhile Gill and Nemo almost make the perfect plan for escape, until the dentists daughter Darla who kills fish out of bad behavior comes and Nemo was about to become her birthday present until Nemo plays dead in order to escape. Then Marlin, Dory and Nigel come in and started a scene in order to rescue Nemo until the dentist chases them out and Darla starts shaking Nemo in the bag until Gill stops her and sends Nemo down the drain which leads to the ocean. Meanwhile Marlin was sad cause he thought Nemo was actually dead and then Dory finds Nemo and brings him to Marlin and then Dory gets caught in a fish net with other fish. Then Nemo comes up with a plan in order to rescue Dory and that was to have all the fish swim down and he lead them down while Marlin was telling them to swim down and it worked. All the fish and Dory were free and then Marlin, Dory and Nemo go back home to their reef and Marlin now knew that Nemo could be responsible.

Every time I go to a Disney movie, I do so in a state of innocent anticipation, and every time I'm bitten by their warped morality. The Lion King was another case in point. The fact that these things are aimed at children and vetted approvingly by parents who seem oblivious to the underlying theme forces one really to consider to what extent movies like this are a reflection of the values of modern Western society, - or whether they work to bring about those values. Either way, I would be less frightened of the future if they where more frequently subjected to the accusatory criticism they deserve.",
394,30 May 2003,JAKastner,9, The Moose Hole - Review of Finding Nemo,"You can always count on a Pixar film to create loads of family fun as parents and children alike take some time off their busy schedules to enjoy another one of their features. They sure have a great record for it. They began with the surprise hit Toy Story, which started the long-standing trend of computer animated films. They followed with A Bug's Life in 1998, Toy Story 2 in 1999 and Monsters Inc. in 2001. Pixar outperforms each of their previous efforts which is very rare in the modern Hollywood scene. Now, after taking a year off, they take audiences to the ocean in Finding Nemo. But how well will the film do? This is the first time a Pixar film has been placed during the summer time (all previous efforts had been released in November) but this allows for more success with children finishing school. Another problem for the film is lack of voice talent. Monsters Inc. had the advantage of John Goodman and Billy Crystal in the leading roles but the voices for this film are less known. This doesn't matter to children but it can be for some adults.  The question is whether Finding Nemo can continue Pixar's trend of success or will be the film be sunk by the competition?",
395,27 April 2010,tomb_92,9, Magical and beautiful. One of Pixar's best works.,"It's not necessarily one of Pixar's most funny films, that title certainly goes to Toy Story 2. Yet I think that Finding Nemo has to be one of their most magical. One thing that Pixar does brilliantly apart from the script and the characters is to create new worlds. Toy Story creates a world in which toys come to life. A Bug's Life creates a world in which bugs run a society similar to that of our own, Finding Nemo creates a world in which sea-life interact similarly to humans- a remarkable feat that they pull off extremely well. It's an adventure story in which a dedicated father sets out to find his only relation. the character development is remarkable for a children's film- Pixar never underestimates their audience. The result is a beautifully created, wonderfully written piece, that maybe goes on a bit longer than it needs to, but it is funny in places and certainly will keep kids and adults interested.",

403,26 December 2006,yayagirl14,10, I just love Pixar to death,"OK, before i go onto my, Finding Nemo is the best movie ever rant, i will begin by stating some things wrong with many of the ""hated it"" comments. First of all, Disney DID NOT WRITE IT. Andrew Stanton and Bob Paterson did, they work for Pixar. second of all, everyone says, this is the typical, loss of parents movie. Well yes partly, but not necessarily. The movie is called finding memo, not memo is lost, or memo's lost adventures. Which means the movie is NOT about memo, it is about marlin. So did marlin loose his parents, not that we know of. Also, the point of the movie is not memo triumphs, it is a father son movie, that was trying to relate to actual experiences of people. The movie shows the growing of these two fish to understand each other. Marlin and memo grow in understanding that yes, memo needs boundaries, but he needs freedom as well. Now for the ranting. First, Nemo has the most stunning images of all the Pixar movies. Obviously fish don't talk, and obviously it is animation. But you feel almost as if you were underwater for real, with animated fish. Now the plot is a little run of the mill, but Pixar does so much with it. Bringing in such characters like the tank, or dory (of course), the turtles etc. Also, the comedy is golden. The obvious comedy comes from Dory easily, but Marlin (Albert Brooks) brings so much more in the end. Pixar really tries to relate its plots to actual experiences. Like most children think that their toys talked and came alive, most children think that there are monsters under the bed or in the closet. A huge fear in children is the fear of separation. Overall, Pixar is the greatest animation company right now, i think. They put so much effort into all of their movies, and the end result is spectacular.",

The story is simple and straightforward: an overprotective father clownfish traverses the ocean that petrifies him in search of his son, who has been relocated to a seaside dentist's office by divers and kept in an aquarium.

This film gives me a warm fuzzy feeling whenever I think of it. In my opinion it's better than the Incredibles. The characters are better developed and more likable, and the storyline is more cohesive and accessible to children, while not boring adults. There is also a lack of bitter sarcasm and meanness that sometimes rear their ugly heads even in children's films. What makes this movie so great to me is the fact that i believe it to really be not a children's film, but a film for adults that happens to be wonderfully appropriate for children. It doesn't try to talk down to kids and teach them some silly lesson about sharing and caring etc... but simply exists as loving entertainment.",

Or maybe that close to it. Director Andrew Stanton wanted a really deep father and son movie, and he get such deepness that even the sea became such a little pond compared to it. Nemo's odyssey in the tank is a great contrast and irony (the poor kid wants the exterior) compared to the odyssey of the father, who is scared of the outside, and fights his fears and demons to save not only his son but himself, and find the real sense of life between those jellyfish that create a beautiful and deadly pink forest. From the De-intoxication center sharks to the creepy angler fish, this movie has a rhythm compared only to a roller coaster, it never stops, and when I say never stops I mean that it always keep your attention. You wont yawn, you wont get bored, not only because that terrific screenplay, but because the production design is almost perfect, maybe even perfect. Every bubble, every little fish, has a meaning in every frame. Every scene is like the final result of thousand of previous decisions and discussions. This is Pixar's gold to it's pure status, shinny, beautiful and very heavy (in terms of multi-layered messages) and makes a big mark in the animation world and history.

Finding Nemo is a children's movie. It is not an achingly poetic masterwork of biblical proportions. For all its polished aesthetic splendor, it is one of many recent Pixar cuddle-tear smorgasboards that have smack of the Pixar ""formula."" This is, of course, more multifaceted than you might hope. First, and foremost there is the element of the micro society where one least expects it: the anthropomorphic personification in various aspects of the animal kingdom or underwater or inanimate objects like toys, insects pretty much anything that looks cute. Pixar, which has modeled itself on Disney (for starters...in that, it is trying and succeeding to be the 2nd successful animation studio in the history of the cinema) is taking a page from Herr Walt, but not just simply by making animals...talk. There is the now mandatory wacky assortment of characters in whatever new environment our cutesy little poopy poof protagonist enters: usually an inexplicably dumb character, a hardened, raspy-voiced pessimist who has the seen the outside and yearns for a taste of liberation, a simple character driven mad by the plasticized existence of the microcosm they are confined to, the optimist, completely spiritually and intellectually fulfilled with appeasing the idiotic requests of the master, or overlord or Orwellian gumbent-a-clef, easing into a life of quiet desperation, finding simple pleasures in the banal daily regimen and the emigrant, caught in the middle. Perhaps these scenarios which Pixar seems to be ejaculating in majestic, new colors every few years are truly subversive and anti-American with their One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nestesque allegories...or maybe they're just smoking PCP. Still, they're a whole lot better than the CGA DreamWorks is churning out. Don't believe me?

While the other films have been excellent, this one set a new standard for them. The color palette in the ocean murkiness is fabulous and makes us feel a part of the world we are in. The characters are wonderful. Whether they are on for a moment or throughout the entire movie, you care for them. Yes, they kind of hit you over the head with a message here and there, but that in no way distracts from the enchantment and thrill of this movie. I should call it a fable, because it plays out that way. The basic overriding theme is getting father and son back together. And this is one story all ages can relate to. Who hasn't in their lifetime gotten ""lost"" for a brief moment from their parents? The theme resonates deep with us.

446,27 June 2003,IMSandman,10," Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!!","I have seen a ton of movies in my life, but few are better than Finding Nemo.  The storyline is excellent.  The animation is out of this world. The humor is witty and plays to both children and adults alike (perhaps even more so toward the adults).   The cast is great and convincing.  If you liked the Toy Stories, then you'll love this.  If you have never checked out a Pixar film, you are missing out.   This is worth buying before renting. I could have paid $25 at the box office and still felt I got my money's worth.  10 stars.",

456,3 June 2003,ForReal84,10, One of the best movies of the year!,"FINDING NEMO is one of the best-animated movies to hit theaters since Monster's INC. Disney and Pixar have done another astounding job. They produce films that teach a lesson or two, but also squeeze out many laughs along the way. It is a movie about a father trying to find his only son. It turns the sea into a fast paced world of humor and fun. Like Toy Story it turns a simple idea into two hours of fun and laughs. Disney and Pixar should be awarded many awards for there achievement. Nemo is a very superior movie that has an important message. Again the special effects are amazing. Further more everything looks very true to life. It's neat how they do it. Along for the swim are Albert Brooks, Ellen Degeneres, William Dafoe, Brad Garrett, and Ailison Janney. There voice work is very funny. The characters in this film are very good. They turn ordinary fish into extraordinary characters. Ellen Degeneres should be given an Academy Award for her voice work. She is very funny as Dory. She carries many of the scenes with an effortless force of humor and innocence. Finding Nemo is a great family film of everyone. All in all it is one of the best movies to hit theaters this year. 3.89/4",

458,15 June 2016,allyball-63124,10, Pixar's Masterpiece,"Okay, this is going to be a hard movie to talk about. This movie is the closest thing to universally loved that you can get and many other better reviewers have already reviewed this. With that out of the way, it's about time I review a Pixar movie. It also happens to be favorite Pixar movie and it just so happens to be getting a sequel that at the time of writing, is coming tomorrow for me. I love pretty much everything about this movie from beginning to end. Well, my one big problem with the movie, which is borderline nitpicking, is the first like 3 minutes. So for the 5 people who haven't seen this movie, it opens with a happy couple who are expecting kids. They act all sweet for a bit and then a barracuda comes out of nowhere and eats the mother and the 400 unborn children. You now for kids! Jokes aside, this scene is way too intense for even me today. Every time I watch the scene, I burst out crying and last time that happened was in a class full of preteens. Yeah, this is a personal problem but it's thankfully a small problem and the scene that follows is absolutely beautiful. Thankfully, the rest of the scene is a little tamer but still very emotionally involving. The story itself is fairly simple but emotionally charged. It's a very relatable situation even if the viewer isn't an adult. The thing that helps, is every character is memorable and relatable, especially my favorite of the bunch, Dory. There's a reason Finding Dory is a thing outside of profit. It's because Dory was the most loved character in the whole movie. She is funny, sweet, fun-loving and of course she forgets things very easily. I always loved that aspect of her character and I relate to her a lot. I also have to give a shout out to the underrated ""tank gang."" Each of them have very unique and fun personalities and each are distinguishable and love-able. I also have to marvel over the animation in this movie. The water looks like real water! Yet, the cartoony characters don't look or feel out of place in the very realistic ocean. Overall, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and I can only hope that the sequel will be good.",

471,22 September 2013,darnel04,9, Finding Nemo is an animation to see.,"Pixar's Finding Nemo is an animation film. It is set mostly in the ocean at Australia's Great Barrier Reef and in Sidney Australia. The main characters are Marlin (voice by Albert Brooks), Nemo (voice by Alexander Gould) and Dory (voice by Ellen DeGenneres). The story is of a father and son and the love they have for each other. In this story father and son are clown fish that live at the Reef. The father is overprotective and son is ready to take on the world even though one of his fins is small. In the film Nemo and his father get separated. The journey begins by Marlin to find his son. Along the journey Marlin faces many obstacles. Marlin also meets news friends that help along the way. This film compares with Toy Story when it comes to friends that are willing to help. One friend that makes the journey with Marlin is Dory a pretty blue fish that has short term memory loss. Sometimes along the journey Marlin is not the most cooperative. He comes to realize you cannot be protected from everything. The background music makes the mood for the coming event. At one point in the ocean Marlin and Dory come upon a shark named Bruce. Bruce takes them through a mine field. The music played is eerie. It keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat. Moving among the mines is delicate so as not to set any of them off. The music sets the suspense for the scene. Another scene that using music effectively is after Nemo is added to the fish tank there is a ceremony done by the fish that already reside in the tank. The ceremony starts the music and chanting gradually escalates louder and louder building suspense for Nemo to be an accepted member. The editing in the film has kept the pace of the film moving. The action continues from one obstacle to another for Marlin, Dory and Nemo. There are some conflict scenes and the editing starts the conflict cuts away and re-enters after the conflict with any violence being left out. In the beginning of the movie there is an attack by a barracuda. Marlin tries to protect his family. The barracuda swats him away with his tail. The next scene is Marlin waking up and realizing what has happened. This gives all of the details for the viewer to create what happened in their own minds. At the same time there are no graphic parts for children to endure. I enjoyed the film. The action continues to the end. The overall quality of the film is well done. The color of the many fish in the ocean and the reef itself are worth seeing this film. If you have children Finding Nemo is a must see. As adults the film is still entertaining and worth the time to view. This film can teach a valuable lesson of trust between parents and children.",
472,22 September 2013,anpatterson0607,9, Dive into the Ocean,"Finding Nemo is not only a great animation, but also a great lesson for parents. With a humorous cast including Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, Albert Brooks as Marlin, Alexander Gould as Nemo, and Willem Dafoe as Gill; Finding Nemo sends viewers on a heart wrenching, suspenseful, humorous journey for a fishes only son. This movie had me in tears within the first five minutes of the movie, when a drastic loss happens. The journey shows the battles and heartache that parents face when losing a young one. Marlin, the single parent, has a hard time ""letting go"" to his only son Nemo for his first day of school. When he finally does, Nemo gets lost. The movie explores the ocean while Marlin searches for his son. Marlin faces many of his fears in search of his son. As the movie takes you on this journey, a journey similar to Toy Story, where a lost toy brings unity among all toys; Nemo, as the lost fish, brings unity to fish and birds in search of him. The similarities in plot and underlying story messages are similar however Lee Unkrich, Andrew Stanton, the directors of Finding Nemo, do a great deal to engage the viewers right away. Throughout the movie the open sea and other ocean creatures fill the audience with great invisible sound. The movie gives viewers the ocean like feel with the invisible sound of the ocean animals and ocean water, and also the lighting in the scenes gives the realistic ocean depth. Both of these techniques are used greatly throughout the film while Marlin and Dory face adventures in the open sea. While Marlin and Dory lead viewers through the ocean they face many obstacles. The overall story of the film would be to have trust in one another. A good quote from the film, which is reiterated at the end of the film, ""You think you can do these things, Nemo, but you just can't!"" This quote ties the over-all theme together. Marlin had very little trust in his son's abilities, yet had he given him the benefit of the doubt at the beginning of the movie, it may have prevented Nemo from getting lost in the first place. This movie uses very good techniques that allow the viewer to sink into the ocean, and help Marlin to find his son. Dory plays the humorous girly-fish who adds humor to the bad situation, and who also helps Marlin to lighten up. I think all parents can learn a thing or two from this movie, and could use the humorous outlook on life, like Dory's!",

The story is sweet but not cheesy, in the perfect ""old Disney"" style, with a bit of sadness in the beginning and a nice happy ending.

Albert Brooks & Ellen Degeneres (especially) did their most & unforgettable performances of their career and had many memorable lines!! Others did excellent, Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) made a memorable Australain pelican and Gill (Willem Dafoe) did well, too. One of greatest animated films ever made and funniest. It's one of Pixar's best.

(Peer pressure, I think ?) A dentist diver picks him up to add to his dental office aquarium of tropical fish. His father , whose name is Marlin, try's to find him. Hence the name , Finding Nemo. He meets a very forgetful (sometimes just downright stupid) Dory. They spend the rest of the movie doing stupid things. They find the diver's mask that took Nemo. Dory ,in a memorizing spree, memorizes the address written on it. They eventually find him ,of course, and the movie thankfully ends. I would have written more, but it pains me to write even this. Nemo's voice is very whiny and annoying. Ellen is an okay Dory ; I don't think the greatest actors or actresses in the world could have saved this one. Little kids probably enjoy this one , and adults probably do to. But for me, this is a Disney/Pixar mistake.",

Simba (Kimba) lost his father. And yet there is no explination or coming to terms with the missing parents (I don't think Simba came to terms with anything). I disliked this movie because it seemed like the same old Disney rant of some one is in trouble and needs help cause they're lost. Guess I just like good animation with an excellent story.

First of all, I noticed in Finding Nemo was that there were not any songs. most disney movies have parts where the charectors break into song, not in Finding Nemo. Secondly, I found some of the charectors quite annoying, especially the blue fish. Lastly, the worse thing about Finding Nemo is that so many people talk like it was the best kids movie ever made.

From the first minutes, my 3 year old was terrified of the film, it didnt help that they started it off with a preview of the Pirates of the Carribean movie. The film was filmed with dark imagery and some scary moments, enough that after the first 15 or so minutes, my 3 year old was asking if we could go home now. The clown fish was annoying, not funny. Dory (think that was her name) had some great funny moments, but not enough to save Nemo. The highlight was the turtles and shark moments, but for the most part it is down to a very familiar pattern that is getting old.

Finding Memo was a tough, tough feature film to make in terms of it's character constructions and underwater effects.  I found that one of the unique thing about this film is that each fish(species) has a absolute mono personality, which pushed this animation into a higher level, and of course harder to make too. Thanks to our smart and hard working creaters.  This film pushes animation industry to a position in which it should be by now, although the whole underwater scenery still look CG so to speak, but if we look back at toy story I, the fish are more real and people like. We have to accept that audiences are much more ""comfortable"" to see such a touching, funny, CG Feature Film.

The movie was like an emotional roller coaster. About every 10 minutes, the plot would cycle through scary, sad, then hilarious. Repeated over and over. I was scared several times, (this movie is too scary for children 5 or less I think). Then it would be sad, and I would cry a little (or get red-eyed), then while I had tears in my eyes, something hilarious would happen, and I would be laughing through the tears. I loved the happy ending, if only life could be happy endings also! The happy ending made me cry too. I think it was better than Bambi or Beauty and the Beast. Or the Lion King. I would like to see this movie about 10 more times (well, 5 anyway!!) It's philosophy is about Parenting, be sure to love your kids, you never know if something might separate you from them. And be nice to those with short-term memory loss, they are more helpful to have around than you might realize (like me!!)

There are many funny jokes put in for both children and adults, and the characters are very connected to their target audience (being families).

You get a lead who's believably troubled but still likable, one of the best sidekicks in movie history, and a quest you can believe in with a consistently entertaining slew of obstacles that never go on long enough to get boring or stay so short you wish you had more. It's practically perfect.

It is funny, touching, visually stunning, and completely entertaining at every level. The voice talent is uniformly stunning, though it is Ellen DeGeneres who steps up a few classes and all but steals the movie as Dori, the fish with no short-term memory.

The plot is good, the characters are charming, and it has fair amount of emotional moments that hits you in the feels. The chemistry between Marlin and Dory is fun to watch. However, the animation and the score are obviously the biggest point overall, especially in the underwater segment where the score slaps HARD and it gives that euphoric feel.

The 'family' concepts of upbringing, love and devotion are definitely the strong points of this movie. Though my daughter (she's only 2!) does not understand a word, she loves each and every scene in this movie!! The only thing my daughter did not like about this movie was perhaps the fact that Nemo did not have a mother. We made her think Dori and Marlyn are Nemo's father and mother!

567,2 June 2003,Krakn3Dfx,7," Not Monsters, Inc., but still enjoyable","I took my 2 kids to see Finding Nemo this morning.  As Bruce Almighty would say, it looked B-E-A-utiful.  Unfortunately, the storyline was not up to par with Pixar's previous efforts, and I thought the funny was few and far between (that's right, I said 'the funny').  I enjoyed Albert Brooks, who always gives a stellar performance, as well as Ellen DeGeneres.  Brad Garrett using his Robert Barone voice as the blowfish was a great choice, but unfortunately there was too little of the witty action that you normally see in Pixar movies, and instead there's quite a bit of the tense action that you usually see in a Jurassic Park movie instead of a Pixar animation. I would rate this movie as being better than A Bug's Life, which I didn't care for, but not as good as either Toy Story 1/2 or Monsters, Inc.  The teaser for Pixar's next movie and the animated short before the main feature were both great tho, and when all was said and done, I'm still not sorry that I went to see it.  My 9 year old daughter didn't care much for it, but my almost 3-year old son liked it quite a bit. In the end, I would say to see it, if nothing else but for the incredible animation that is definitely a benchmark for pure CG movies (excepting Final Fantasy, but I don't hold that in the same category with Pixar or Dreamworks films).  Enjoy it for what it is and you'll be fine.",

Animation is excellent and leaves nothing to complain about, but the story is not that good. It feels very disjointed and fragmentary, you don't really feel the flow (despite it being set in the ocean). Often it is too predictable (I know, it's not a thriller, but still you can make it somewhat original and surprising sometimes) and during some moments even boring. There is not really much for adults in this film (like there was in Shrek), except for quite funny Memento-like Dora with her short-term memory loss, a couple forced semi-funny jokes, like ""what's with men asking for direction"" and supposedly funny ""totally cool"" turtle ""dude"".",

Nemo goes to school for the first time and is embrassed by his father and is captured by an Austrialian dentist.  Marlin comes across another fish named Dory( Ellen DeGeneres) who has a short-term memory loss.  The two of them come across very adventrous and humorous characters such as surfing turtles, a shark named Bruce who is on a twelve step program to stop eating fish, and other fish that have the need to express themselves through a games of shraides.  Meanwhile, Nemo is being held in a dentist office in Sdyney, Austrialia.  He mates with other fish who are very desperate for an escape from the office back into the ocean.

Though the main characters of Finding Nemo are sea creatures like fish, turtles and sharks, this story tells the bond of family.people who watch it can understand the feelings of parents for example worries, angry and also receive the ideas of children. Children want to do new things without thinking deeply. At this animation, Nemo plays do same thing like children. I think it tells not the faults of children but the difficulty of relationship between parents and children. Also, it is a good text for pubescent girl and boy, because Finding Nemo teaches how parents love daughter or son. There are many challenges for Nemo and Nemo's father, so people who see this always are exciting. I recommend Finding Nemo.",

The story is strong, the voice characterisations are just perfect with Ellen DeGeneres standing out as the Oscar winning performance and the underwater animation is simply breathtaking. I would defy anyone not to get something from this film and if ever computers needed justification for their existence, this one film provides just that.

My only problem?  The music.  It is not the score was particularly bad.  In fact, it was quite engrossing, but what I have come to expect from animation films is a type of sing-along, the modern American musical, and I thought that that was sorely missed.  Many will scoff at my request for this type of music in Nemo, believing that it would demeaning for such a good film.  But music does not lower the artistic level of such a film, indeed, for a film with this specific audience, songs can be the best way to bring individuals into the story and raise audience involvement.

As a children's film, it enchants and creates a wonderfully exciting world. Like its predecessors (Toy Story, A Bugs Life, Monsters, Inc.), Finding Nemo provides a fantasy world based in reality  something that, as children, we all dreamed could be true. As an animation, Pixar once again provide stunning visuals; each film made, somehow manages to look better than the last. The computers are getting better and the animators are getting more and more ambitious. Bright colours swirl around the ocean depths and it's one of those films you could watch without the sound on and just enjoy the marvelous imagery. And, last but not least, the writers have included much for us adults to be able to laugh at. Much of the writing is subtle, witty and brilliantly constructed (with at least one fart joke  to keep us all happy).",

First thing to be said is that the animation is the best to date, as should be expected from the wonderful Pixar team. The plot of this film is wonderful. It has many ups and downs, and it handles the back and forth look between the adventures of the father and the son. The script is excellent. There are many wonderful lines in the film, and never once did I feel this movie was attempting to make children's jokes. The script is very mature. The acting (animation) is wonderful. Lots of emotion visually was conveyed through the characters. The acting (voicing) is great too. All voices matched characters well and I really enjoyed the variety of stereotype voices. Voicing scene-stealer: William DeFoe's, ""That never stopped me,"" as he displays his mutilated side. The cinematography was outstanding. Great camera angles, shots using color were beautiful, while shots that incorporated the suspense of the difficult-to-see-through water were -- well, suspenseful. Finding Nemo is funny, scary, suspenseful, thrilling, moving, and definitely entertaining. This is one of those films that people will have on their DVD rack. See it. Enjoy.",

There are extra scenes and deleted scenes, but these are mainly sketches and hence are not included as part of the regular movie. The movie itself is worth buying this set; its bright and flashy with cool visuals and special effects that make it attractive for kids. The soundtrack is considerably different from the traditional classical fair found in Disney's motion length pictures. This movie's soundtrack is laid back and different, but paces well with the action. The voice-overs are great, and the comedy is unique and hilarious. Vegetarian sharks! Fish without memory!

Awesome colors, breathtaking underwater seascapes and oceanographic detail, plus plain damned funny and  entertaining characterizations, dialogue and story!  Actually dare I use the word genius? I'm 47 years old, hold several degrees, including one in marine biology, and I can honestly say that the folks at Pixel and Disney certainly did their zoological homework on this one.  Easily the best animated feature I have seen in decades.  I've also surf, have been to Sydney and have many Australian friends, so this made the surf-talking `dude' sea turtles and Australian inside-jokes even that much more funny.  But at least for me it was those blasted seagulls that won the laugh award for me.  I couldn't help busting up completely in the theatre every time they made an appearance, `mate'!

Brooks is exemplary, he is the worried, unselfish, loving father. Everyone was exemplary in voice and emotion. I heard a TV critic say that Ellen DeGeneris deserved a prize, and if you knew how these complex characters are created by voice and then drawn, you would have to agree. Through emotions of both sadness and joy we felt love for the family. The humor was agreeable to my age (over 50) and it must have been agreeable to children too, considering the high box office. The young kindergarten characters were so joyfully portrayed that I can still see them in my mind.

Too many people seem to blindly give high ratings to animated features just because they were made by Pixar. Bottom line is this movie is for kids and humorless adults.",

624,14 June 2003,Eli_Cash,7, A remarkable animated road film without a road,"Finding Nemo is wonderful.  Gorgeous to look at with animation that wouldn't be possible even five years ago and written with deft, fun, and heart. The film may suffer from being directed solely at kids and there requisite guardians (me and my brother were likely the only 15 to 25 year-olds in the whole cineplex) which makes the plot structure of the titular youngen Nemo swimming off on his own to do some much needed growing up while simultaneously forcing his father Marlin to challenge himself and grow no small amount himself so delightfully subversive.  Defoe, Brooks and Rush's voicework is quite brilliant but believe me when I say this, DeGeneres improbably steals the show.  After the first word her character Dory said I shuddered and thought I'd be in for a long two hours.  But with significant screen time she never once got tiresome or annoying.  I caught myself laughing at her jokes and thought to myself, 'this is Ellen DeGeneres, right?'  Y'all may not have my inborn mistrust of DeGeneres, but those who do, don't miss out on a truly surprising road film without a road.",

633,1 June 2003,CoolDan,10," One of the most touching, heartwarming films I've ever seen. An absolute must-see.","To start this review, let me just say that there is a difference between a feel-good movie and a feel-warm movie. Toy Story 2 was built to be a feel-good movie, and it succeeded in spades. Finding Nemo was built to be a feel-warm movie, and wow, wow, wow, does it ever succeed in spades. If I wasn't so freakishly mature, I would have been sobbing like a baby during this movie, but rest assured I was choked up good. When the movie ended, the audience applauded (including me) and I left the theater with an involuntary dazzling smile on my face and a heart filled up like a water balloon. I'm going to say this right off the batthis is Pixar's second best movie and so far one of the best movies of the year. It falls short of Toy Story 2 but only by a hair. This is one of the bravest movies Pixar has done. You see, Pixar has mastered the classic CGI comedy-adventure movie with a hint of drama. That's what made the Toy Story flicks and A Bug's Life so good. And Pixar could have easily used this winning formula for Finding Nemo, but it didn't. It instead tried to achieve a classic CGI drama-adventure with a hint of comedy. It was a daring risk that could have failed, but instead it succeeded beyond what I could have ever imagined. It was only touching, never mushy. Even though this is a wild under-sea adventure complete with a fish with bad memory and a surfer-dude turtle, it's a movie many people can relate to. You see, this movie is about Marlin, a fish who loses his son, the only one left from a shark attack that kills the rest of his children and his wife. And Marlin dedicates the rest of his life to raising and protecting his son, whom he names Nemo. But when Nemo is kidnapped by a diver, the only thing that meant anything to Marlin, the only big thing in his life he had left, is gone. Everyone knows what it's like to have something very, very important to them, be it a trinket or a son, and when it gets lost, many people will weep and not do anything. But it's a rare breed of people who try to search for that thing at any cost. And Marlin is part of that breed. He never gives up trying to find his son the entire movie, and that is the most heartwarming aspect of this movie. But that's not the only good thing about this movie. The score, the voicework, the animation, and the comedy also deserve major kudos. And while the movie is a little less satisfying than Toy Story 2 (emphasis on little), this is still Pixar's runner-up best movie and one of the best movies of the year. Highly recommended. Bring yourself, bring the kids, and bring the Kleenex.",
634,21 June 2003,B_Steels,10, Finding Gold,"Pixar has a perfect track record, with such brilliant films as Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. in its catalog. Upping the visuals effects and providing an awesome, humourous, inspiring story made Finding Nemo possibly their best film yet. The movie follows the journey of Marlin, a frightened clownfish who is trying to find and save his lost son Nemo. Along the way he befriends Dory, who is voiced confidently and perfectly by Ellen DeGeneres. The 2 make their way through the dangerous ocean, braving sharks, whales, and jellyfish. Meanwhile, Nemo tries to escape the dentist office fish tank where he wound up. It's a touching story that's full of action and is ultimately very inspiring. Finding Nemo is a work of art, that nobody should miss, regardless of age. A must-see in every sense.",

I don't think so. has any animated film ever had such detail? probably not. but it simply isn't worth sitting through the hour and half view time of this depressingly slow movie just for the visual dynamics. I have the sneaking suspicion that the animators at pixar had the visual concept LONG before a storyline and had to make one up on the fly. the beginning is so sad and miserable that the ending feels utterly anti-climatic. never have I seen such a gorgeously animated children's film that left me feeling so hopeless and sad. in short if you want realism and breathtaking detail. watch some nature shows on discovery channel in HD. and if,like me. you want to be entertained stick with Monster's Inc or Ice Age",

This one was different though. It kept me entertained, I've seen it at least 15 times now, and I'm still entertained by it. And the little girl, well, a 2 year old's attention span isn't exactly the best, and typically she doesn't pay attention to a whole movie played through. Not Nemo though, she'll stand (literally stand) in front of the TV and stare mesmerized at what she's seeing, from start to finish, over and over again. Hopefully it doesn't have any adverse effects on her development, lol.

678,27 November 2011,maithy_bui,8, Humanistic Approach to the Film,"I love to watch animated movies. I find them so entertaining, even though most people would say that those types of movies were meant for little kids I don't think that I will ever out grow them. Finding Nemo (2003) directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich is in my opinion one of the best movies. Little kids love to watch these animated pictures, they teach kids and help them form an understanding of the world. Most of Pixar films, if not all of Pixar's films have a message in them, something the creator wants us to get out of the film besides watching it for merely our entertainment. Compared to a Disney movie, Pixar pictures have no magic; problems in the movie can't be solved by a wave of a wand or by a fairy godmother. Furthermore, humans are rarely the main characters and most of the films the protagonist is a non human character. In Finding Nemo there are humans in the story however, they play a small role in the film. We also see that in this picture the villain or the antagonist is human for example, Darla, they don't play a big role in the film but they sometimes support the antagonist. In Finding Nemo we see a clown fish, Marlin who is very protective of his only son, Nemo. And with this, already a lot of people can relate. Many parents are overprotective for their child and do not want them to venture out on their own because of the possibility of them getting hurt. Parents are so scared of letting go and letting them explore the world on their own. While watching the film we also see Marlin overcome his fear of the ocean as he travels with Dorothy to find his son. This is probably the most relatable message in the movie with both kids and adults. We all have fears and overcoming them can be really hard but sooner or later we realize that there was nothing to be afraid of. When we see Nemo is stuck in a fish tank at a dentist office Nemo and his new found fish friends try to help him escape. However, it all goes wrong and everyone gave up on the idea because it was dangerous and could've hurt Nemo. But Nemo does not give up he goes and tries again this time succeeding in stopping the water filter. The film attempts to change our lives for the better. For parents its saying that there's a time where you have to let go of your kids being overprotective can be a bad thing and it can lead to your kids getting annoyed/frustrated and refusing to listen to you. For kids, it's to tell them that your parents care and they want to protect you. Also to never give up in anything they do. These messages are universal they apply to everyone around the world. The theme in this film I think is relevant to any parent watching it. Scared of letting go of their kids, being very overprotective, the fear of losing their kids almost every parent can relate to this.",

689,4 May 2008,blanche_blake,5, Not so good,"""Nemo"" had a great advertising just like other films (Shrek, The Incredibles, Chicken Little), and their grand success can be partially explained that way. ""Nemo"" was promoted like another rebirth of Disney and the greatest picture Pixar has never made. The graphics were outstanding, although I was never keen of seeing more than one time 3D animated movies. The original concept, although not very original, was good for standing away from the silly-piggish-not-that-funny-dull-stupid script that 3D animated computer features had taken (aka Shrek, Shark Tale, Madagascar, Shrek II and III, and just because they enjoy to milk the cow, maybe IV, V, VI...). ""Nemo"" stands aside from this. But are some negative aspects. While watching this movie on cinema, some little kids fell asleep during the second part and most of them claimed that the film was just too long and the adults complained about the slow story pace. I can say the same. The thing with Nemo's mother death was so unoriginal, that they even called this ""Bambi and The Lion King deep in the sea"" The parts with Nemo trapped in the dentist office were boring and with its develop, even Marlin and Dory plot with their ""platonic love"" was going the same way. A good soundtrack could easily distract the audience but there was no good soundtrack and not even bad. There was none. Some Disney films needed some time but this should be cut at half.",

Ellen Degeneres had me, as well as other adults there with their children, cracking up throughout the movie and I'm not afraid to admit it. While I hate Albert Brooks with a passion, he was perfect for the role of Nemo's father (voice wise). He, however, was the only character I hated. But I loved all the Tank Fish, and Dory, and the Sharks, & others were all wonderful. I think any open minded person who can enjoy a laugh, or who can remember their youth, would enjoy this movie. For Children it is a fun cartoon full of adventure and surprise. For Adults it is a great movie that makes you reflect on your youth, and if you are a parent, yourself as a parent. It also gives you laughs you'd never expect to have in a movie like this. While Shrek was meaningful and romantic, Finding Nemo was hilarious and really got you into it and has another message to get to everyone and I HIGHLY Recommend you see this before it leaves theatres, and if it's too late..

Finding Nemo has truly, in my opinion, found those elements again. I was greatly entertained with the films intriguing characters and profound plot.  True it is just a cartoon but it was better than your average cartoon:  It relayed the message of letting go.

If it was all scripted, she's a genius because her lines sound absolutely spontaneous. The animation was poignant and extremely accurate. It shows that these guys did their marine life homework before making this film. The story is (as most are) an old one of growing up and letting go but I am particularly grateful to the writers for not putting too many fight/nagging scenes as most movies/TV programs do when they use this type of plot.

Nemo with its great animation is worth seeing!  but only seeing.  the fact than many people are calling this a classic  makes me wonder what movie they saw.  What makes a classic animated movie  is  a good story  and strong characters.  I believe Nemo fails on both counts.  The story line is a basic one.  We follow the path of two fish, nemo and his father marlin  as they get seperated and their attempt to reunite.   The scenes depicted are nicely done  but you feel like you are being swept from one scene to another, the segways are missing. The story line is not deep enough so you can walk away feeling that you missed something in the storyline,  which in fact you haven't, there just isn't anything else there.   The film is also missing out on strong characters. The main characters would all be considered good supporting charcters,  but unfortunately  are asked to carry the  movie. But in their defense how much character can a fish have?  The point being is that finding nemo is a  beautifully animated film about fish  delivering a bunch of comedic lines  telling a simple story  that makes you want more than it delivers.   To me a classic delivers more than you want.",

I enjoyed ""Toy Story"" but wasn't a huge fan of it, the sequel however is an absolute classic hands down. After 'Bugs' and 'TS2' though came ""Monsters Inc"" which again was a really good movie but I wasn't a huge fan of as the ""Where the Wild Things Are""-cloned concept was fine but like TS1 the film got too juvenile and sentimentally sweet for me with the humor just worth the odd giggle more than anything else and only the awesome 'doors' sequence standing out in my mind.",

713,19 July 2006,herchemical_romance,10, 2003's Best,"The latest in a string of tightly written and superbly animated features from Pixar Studios, who have risen to become gods of animation. Finding Nemo begins with one of the darkest openings in Disney cartoon history, telling the story of a father clown-fish named Merlin who loses his wife and all but one of his hundreds of fish eggs in a tragedy destined to make you think twice about ordering fish and chips for dinner. Marlin becomes the over-protective father of Nemo, his sole surviving child who is kidnapped by a scuba diving dentist and placed in a fish tank in his operating room. Thus the search begins, and Marlin must travel through the Great Barrier Reef to rescue his son, conquering his fears and meeting all sorts of strange and interesting creatures on the way (Bruce, a shark battling a ravishing fish addiction, is particularly memorable) The story thrives on simplicity, riding a singular concept all the way to a gloriously satisfying conclusion, and the script is choc-a-block full of gags and one-liners that are genuinely funny for all ages. This, in fact, is the perfect family movie: gorgeous to look at, tightly wound and high-octane, without a trace of pretension or dumb-downed ideals that so frequently condescend the younger market. Finding Nemo is one of the best animated films ever made, a glorious awe-inspiring tale comparable to classics like The Lion King.",

To achieve such magical effects is a wonderous feat, but to combine this with a magnificent script and to have such brilliant character actors such as Albert Brooks, Ellen Degeneres, and Geoffrey Rush, to name a few, justs tops it off for me.

It is without a doubt the sweetest, funniest, most exciting film I (and many others) have seen in years! The backgrounds are beautiful and so life-like! And I can barely find words to describe the characters. They are superbly animated and are brought to life by some extremly talented actors. If (and I very much doubt it) you aren't sure of the plot, here's an insight to it: After the death of his wife and 399 children, Marlin the Clownfish becomes over-protective of his only surviving son, Nemo. When Nemo gets tired of his fathers protectiveness, he abandons the safety of his home and ends up being captured by an Austrailian diver. Nemo then finds himself in the company of the 'Tank Gang' in a dentists office tank. Meanwhile, Marlin desperatly tries to find his son, with the help of the memory-losing, optimistic and Danger-Prone Dory, a Regal Blue Tang fish. Together they encouter vegitarian sharks, a forest of Jellyfish, the EAC-surfing turtles and many more colourful characters in this story about the seas most dedicated father, Marlin and the funniest fish in the world, Dory. I am positive that any Disney-Pixar, fish or touching-movie fan will not be able to resist the brilliance of this film. Treat yourself to Disney-Pixars Greatest acheivement, Finding Nemo! 10/10!

I personally think it's so good that all animation movies should be compared to Finding Nemo before and after release. It was a top box hit, and full of extras as well. Pixar is really reeling in the cash. It was a jackpot of a film, and it will be extremely hard to make another film that will size up to it or even beat Finding Nemo.

This is the funniest animated film I have seen since Toy Story. It's definitely worth seeing. You'll be laughing the whole way through the film!",

I didn't really feel any great tension or emotion, despite the fact that I took my young son, who also had just started school. In fact he was even less thrilled with it than I was, as 10 minutes from the end he wanted to leave and I had to persuade him to stay to the end. No surprise then that his preferred animated films are still Shrek, Monsters Inc and A Bug's Life.",

None of the other Pixar releases (Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc.) quite measured up to the original Toy Story, so I had reduced Nemo to rental status. It took a sold out show of Pirates of the Caribbean to make me experience one of the most enjoyable movies I have had the pleasure of watching on the big screen. There are movies that can be enjoyed equally on the theaters or at home, and there are others that you just have to shell out the 8 or so dollars and watch it on theater, and Finding Nemo is definitely one of the latter.",

When watching it you'll find that at least two people will come out trying to speak whale or quoting 'Fish are friend, not Food' but that's what makes the film so great and memorable.

The animation and backgrounds are superb; it's often a remarkable achievement, and the colorful scenes of marine life and reefs makes it a visual treat. Though the film takes a little while to get going, after a truly heart-wrenching tragic beginning (at least for an animated film), once the search for Nemo starts, it's a non-stop quest with one clever thing after another. In fact, much like its previous siblings, the script is full of amusing situations (such as the chaotic climax at the dentist's office), clever dialogue, and humorous finds. It's also packed to the gills (pun intended) with eccentric characters, such as a trio of sharks trying to kick the habit of eating other fish, a pack of surfer-dude sea turtles, and some dim-witted birds. But the funniest bits are, of course, the myriad of dangers the poor fish must face, from a sea of jellyfish, to the threat of predators, to being swallowed up by a whale.

And not in the way that most kid films do, that are merely bearable and faintly amusing at best to anyone above the age of 14. Finding Nemo has a couple of essentials for all age groups: for kids, there is the moral of the story, the cute and funny characters (think the albatros and the turtle), and of course the happy ending. For adolescents and grown-ups, there are contemporary movie references, and more 'grown-up' jokes that might be hard to grasp for little kids. The amazing animation is always a huge added bonus for anyone who really pays attention to the movie, and would be worth going to the movies for even if the story was only so-so and the dialogue boring.

754,19 August 2008,daddyo21,9, Beautiful animation and Ellen is hilarious,"Finding Nemo is a beautiful work of art. Ellen DeGeneres as Dory is fantastic in this film. The first time I heard Ellen's comedy was a routine that was played on an airplane about bad milk. She has such an interesting, quirky way of looking at the world and the writers of Finding Nemo captured that perfectly in the Dory's character. The animation is gorgeous. The color of the water and the way it changes as the characters swim through it is beautiful. Director Andrew Stanton is hilarious as Crush. What a talented guy.

But I was not prepared at all for how incredibly the movie drew everyone in. When I saw it, it wasn't with an enormous amount of little kids, but with people of all ages- 3 to 75. The voice acting is some of the best  ever- especially Ellen DeGeneres. The character of Dory was taken to a whole other level by the quality of Ellen's voice work- you couldn't help but laugh hysterically at almost everything she said. However, she also proved she could do more than just comedy- I don't know how anyone cannot get the slightest bit misty when she says ""I look at you, and....and I'm home...""  Other great voices by Albert Brooks (Marlin), Allison Janney (Peach), Willem Dafoe (Gil), Alexander Gould (Nemo) and Brad Garrett (Brother Blow) make this movie one of the funniest and feel good films I've seen in a long time.

766,3 August 2003,bleadsoefootball,1, Over rated,"First of all, let me tell you that I am not someone who just  hates all animated movies. Infact I love The Lion King, and recently the only good Disney animated movies are the one's Pixar has made, so I have nothing against Pixar. Both Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are great movies,(especially the first one), and A Bug's Life and Monsters Inc. are definitly a cut above the modern animated movie, but I have to say with disappointment that Finding Nemo is not anywhere near those good movies. Let me start with my biggest complaint, TOO MUCH ACTION! This movie had way too much action for an animated movie. Animated movies aren't about action, but I guess the filmmakers of this movie didn't know that. While I don't mind some action sequences in an animated movie,( like the antalope stampede in Lion King), the action sequences in this movie get a little redundent. I guess the animators are tring to ""wow"" you with the animation, and maybe that would of worked if this was the first movie of it's kind, but now that a lot of these type of movies have come out it's just boring. So then you may ask, what are animated movies about? Two things, laughter and fun, which this film is lacking in. While the other Pixar movies have fun jokes for kids and intelligent jokes for adults this film has none. Sure there maybe a few smart jokes about aquatic creatures in the beginning, but most of the time there is an oppertunity for a joke, they start an action sequence. In my opion, Finding Nemo is probably the most over rated animated movie of all-time.",

I hope Finding Nemo 2 is as good or even better than Finding Nemo 1, although Pixar needs to make a part 2 for the movies really needing them, and it only appears that The Incredibles needs it because we didn't get to know what happened after the ending of The Incredibles since that movie did not have a perfectly happy ending.

However, i find Finding Nemo is one of a dying breed... a Disney film which is actually good. OK, no matter what Disney films will always be here to delight children, but there are few Disney films being produced at the moment that seem to hold parents and children alike. Now it seems that a lot of the time Disney are just cashing in. EVERYTHING has a sequel! And none of the sequels are half as good as the original. I think the Pixar/Disney collaboration has been good. As i said, Finding Nemo is an amazing Disney film that has many of the memorable characters and witty lines that makes it a film sure to be remembered for years to come. I think Disney should stick to the new ideas for movies. New Stories. You don't need to make 7 Lion King movies or Aladdin movies for kids to still love the characters. The Land Before Time film from Universal was quite probably one of if not my favourite film when i was a kid. Now you look at Sky movies and they are showing Land Before Time IX and even more!

This question can be answered in the kids film, Finding Nemo by Disney Pixar. This adventurous film takes place in the ocean where the main characters are fish. The film really shows family issues and how it affects children of adolescence in a funny kids animation about a real serious issue. The fathers and sons relationship starts out edgy because of the issues in the family, but the father and the sons relationship starts to grow throughout the film. In the end there's almost always a solution to this, but nothing you would quite see in the film, Finding Nemo.

There were no cheap innuendos, nothing but good clean fun. At the same time, it was never stupid or clownish (no pun intended). I would really like the creators of this film to know that I appreciated their work as being an effort in ""using one's powers for good, not evil.""

783,1 May 2006,elb62886,10, Finding Nemo review,"Three years ago, Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar teamed up to release Finding Nemo to the masses. The hit children's underwater adventure video is an animated story based on a rebelliously independent young clownfish and his overprotective father's inability to let go. Enticed by a witty trailer and a captivating graphical design, Finding Nemo attracted a wide audience to the theatres. Digitally mastered and exquisitely written, Finding Nemo premiered May 3rd, 2003, as a G rated, light hearted, animated production geared towards children. The familiar voices of main characters, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) and Marlin (Albert Brooks) teamed up in an encore partnership, returning from 1998's Dr. Dolittle. The hour and 44 minute presentation that brought over $300 million to the box office in its first week in the theatres. The script is a roller-coaster of friendly humor, written by Andrew Stanton and is sincerely thought provoking for Disney's adult viewers. Finding Nemo is sure to become a childhood classic. The opening scene is at Nemo's elementary school. Marlin, the widowed single parent, introduces Nemo to his teacher as a timid student, who requires extra attention for his special needs. Crowds will chuckle at the cynical humor, merciless mimicking students in the background and defining sarcastic gestures in this scene. Taunted by his peers, Nemo challenges his father, swimming farther and farther out into the abyss, towards a row boat at the surface. By the time Marlin catches his curiously disobedient son in the act, he swam far away from the group and was at the surface. The authors' creative expressiveness and ingenuity with the line ""he touched the butt!"" is innocent enough for six year olds to repeat, and at the same time harmlessly pokes fun at the daily trials parents face with young children. With the conscious lesson that every ill minded action has consequences, the row boat unexpectedly carries Nemo away from his home. Marlin enlists into a desperate rescue attempt for his beloved son and soon encounters Dory, the annoying travel companion with the funky problem of poor short term memory. In their travels, Marlin and Dory accidentally stumble upon two great white sharks. Instantly intrigued, Dory tries to make new friends, while Marlin backs off because of preconceived stereotypes about vicious great white sharks. As it turns out the two have joined to form an anti fish eating support group. With a membership pledge of ""fish are friends, not food"", Marlin and Dory escape a near death experience. In this fast paced scene that speaks to breaking stereotypes, adults will pick up on the parody on the politics of vegetarianism and a poke at ""meaningless"" support groups. Some of the content in this two minute scene may frighten younger viewers, as the loud noises, exploding mines and sharks with big scary teeth dominate the screen. Pressing on with the goal of finding his son in Sydney, Marlin and Dory ride the East Australian Current with a huge pack of sea turtles, and Marlin has a chance to tell his epic story. One of the elder turtles and an experienced parent, Crush (voice of Andrew Stanton) listens in, imparts some wisdom, and helps Marlin regain a firm a grasp on life. His advice, and the movie's main message, is that children are going to grow up and that part of successful parenting is letting them go and watching them. You have to know that you have done all you can for your children and that they have learned well. The climax of the movie is this scene, where Marlin realizes his error and finally begins to believe in his son. As the music tempo accelerates, the current quickens and the scene makes a dramatic switch back to a comedic tone, keeping children on the edge of their toes and leaving adults satisfied with the depth of content matter. Having arrived in Sydney, Marlin immediately jumps back into the search for his son. While the graphics change with the new on-land scenery, their impressive Pixar quality remains. New sounds from the city and music perfectly accompany every plot curve as the two fish face new challenges of human and bird interaction. A pelican named Nigel flies in to save the two fish from a particularly hungry flock of seagulls placing bids on their next meal, saying ""Mine! Mine! Mine!"" in their thick Australian brogue. The creative scripting is again paired with a hidden message of parenting that sometimes you need to take a risk and trust other people. Finding Nemo is a fantastic film, with much thought, enthusiasm and heart behind the plot, animation and message. Finding Nemo leaves Mom and Dad with a feeling of parental community in that they are not alone in their struggles with parenting. The innocent humor and narrative plot leaves children wanting to watch the movie several times over and quote their favorite lines with friends. The movie is appropriate for all children ages six and older and all adults who are young at heart. The underlying comedy and animation in this film hides a message that speaks of social issues, politics and parenting, which makes Finding Nemo a great movie for children and adults alike.

They did exaggerate the colors a bit (like how deb and flo are blue and white striped with a blue tail while the species they are suppost to be are black and white striped with a white tail) and they, of course, drastically exaggerated the emotions fish can feel.

836,19 June 2011,myers82,10, Finding Nemo,"Finding Nemo is an animated film created in 2003 about the father –son adventure through the mysterious wonders of the ocean and the new discoveries of the land of humans. The story begins as Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould) is the only survivor after a shark attacks his mother and the other eggs. Nemo's father takes Nemo under his fins and they begin their new life together. The story unfolds as Nemo is taken by humans from his home on the coral reef. Nemo's father Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks) sets out on his journey to find Nemo and bring him back home. Nemo becomes entrapped in a fish tank, in a dentist's office, where Nemo learns that he is the new present for the Dentist's niece. Nemo befriends the other fish and together they make the escape from the land of humans to the deep waters of the ocean once again. The battles that Marlin and his new found friend Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres) encounter on their journey through the dangerous waters will capture the audience's attention and will keep the kids guessing on what will happen next. The vivid colors and real life sounds create a world of imagination and fun as the audience becomes entranced with the feeling of swimming right alongside of these new found friends. Finding Nemo is a family movie that tells the tale of a father -son bond and how far someone will go to save the one they love. We see the theme of defeating all odds and overcoming all obstacles for those you love while battling hand in hand with strangers that they now call friends. We saw how Marlin and Dory survived the chase of a vicious shark and escaped the jaws of an anglerfish as they stayed determined to find and rescue Nemo from the unknown dangers of the open sea and land. The extraordinary will power of Nemo, a young fish, has overcome all the challenges that life has thrown at him and will leave an impression on many young viewers. ",

850,5 May 2013,groves11,9, Personal Review,"The general plot of the story is about Marlin (Albert Brooks), who is accompanied by a rather odd fish Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), scouring the seemingly endless ocean for his lost son Nemo (Alexander Gould) who was unfortunately captured by divers and taken away.",
851,10 September 2013,griffin-jedi9478,9, Underwater is heaven!,"This movie is just amazing With a unique setting and characters this isn't just a movie, it is a funny and emotional roller-coaster. Every scene has one or more surprises that are great, Like when Nemo is taking away into a dentists place with other sea creatures it was unexpecting and amazing This movie is amazing, with a lot of surprises I recommend this to loads to people but mostly people under 13 If you like Disney Animated or cartoony movie this is recommended as well. But even though this is a great movie it does feel a bit bad on some scenes but they don't affect the movie too much but it does feel boring and I didn't join that scene but it is still a must see film I am Giving Finding Nemo and amazing 9/10",
852,14 June 2017,TheCGanosis,3, Okay GOOD FOR others,"THAT movie HAS more FILLING it's Not OF my Disney's MOVIE, IT' good FOR the FAMILY and FRIENDS. it HAS the FRIENDSHIP, i WANT to WATCH finding Dory, IS way BETTER as I hear. ZSLEAP in HEAVENLY peace NEMO. and A Christmas episode OR a Christmas it'll BE perfect FOR a GIFT, I know THEY got TO finish WITH ANOTHER movie BUT okay",
853,22 May 2005,illegally_blonde02,10, excellent movie.. the best.,"was an excellent movie, only thing that ruined it was the American accents of the turtles, where as everything else wasn't. but i love the movie all the same.. its my favourite. xx",
854,21 May 2015,paulo-vitortr,10, Useful and Motivation Film,"When I saw this film for the first time I was a little boy exploring Disney and Pixar films. I loved ""Finding Nemo"" because there are no angry, jealous, greedy, or murderous villains as in most traditional Disney animated films. It was just an animation film that used to make me feel a little bit excited. The story is useful for children who thinks that they can do whatever they want without taking consequences. I think we should compare this kind of children with Nemo. And the parents of these children should be compared with Nemo's father because of all the protection that normal families have with their kids. ""Finding Nemo"" can be a motivation film too. Nemo has a physical disability and he tries to prove that it is not a problem for himself. I think ""Finding Nemo"" could be a motivation for children who has physical disabilities too.",
855,30 September 2014,baxleyp,10, World Class,"Finding Nemo is Pixar's greatest movie to date. Everything in the movie is meticulously chosen to add to the atmosphere and send a great message to the viewer. This movie has been out for over ten years and people still recognize all of the characters from it instantly, showing how memorable the movie really was. This movie was one of the first animated films that really wowed people in terms of scope and execution since the first animated Disney films. The key factors that made finding Nemo an instant classic were the brilliantly chosen voice actors, and the atmosphere that the movie was able to bring to the ocean.",
856,11 June 2015,madelineschlaman,8, Pretty Good,"This move is very good! It is definitely a great film for the family to watch together before the kids go to bed! You will all get a good laugh out of this film! And if you guys are worried it is absolutely 100% child approved! I also like this film a lot because the personalities of the characters in this film are a lot like the personalities that people we know have! It is a pretty good movie just to sit back laugh, and enjoy what's happening on the screen without having to stay on high-alert for something scary that the children won't like! Again I completely recommend this film for something that a family could watch together!",
857,18 September 2015,klee-69762,10, Great Movie,The movie I chose to do a film review is Finding Nemo. In the movie it starts off as a couple expecting children. The couple lives in the bottom of the ocean and they are fish. One day everyone in the ocean is fleeing away and before you know it a shark comes by the babies and the woman runs out there to protect them. The shark eats the mom and the babies.,
858,15 October 2015,lucapoulos,10, A great movie for children,"""Finding Nemo"" is a movie about a family of fish that are living their lives in the ocean escaping danger. These fish are mostly safe from everything around them as long as they are cautious, but sometimes that open ocean is an extremely dangerous place from these fish. Especially for Nemo considering the fact that he is a kid and still has a lot to learn about surviving in the ocean. Nemo goes to school and disregards his dad's rules. He is supposed to stick with his class and stay away from the open ocean. Though Nemo with his curiosity doesn't listen to his dad and ends up getting himself into trouble. Nemo finds himself on a fishing ship and ends up in an aquarium with a bunch of other captured fish. His dad goes on a quest to find Nemo while Nemo tries to escape.",
859,16 January 2017,padiyokulon,9, Great animation,"Great characters, amusing animation, and laugh-out-loud humor. Also, watch for the little skit shown after the credits. www.sineemo.com It's all great stuff that simply must be seen.",
860,19 April 2017,drtelepathic,10, Good for everyone.,"It's all about love between older generation and younger generation. This animation reflects today's younger generations' behavior. Even though, it is all about the animals, you may also regard as human beings. Everyone should watch this little cute animation. Don't waste your time by reading my review, just watch it.",
861,28 July 2017,sunshynsmyls,10, Adore this movie,I absolutely love Finding Nemo! One of the best animated movies i've seen. The theme of trust is very good. I like that marlin really has to learn to trust not just nemo but the world around him as well. I love how they made the ocean look so real for an animated movie as well. Very realistic. I feel all the actors did an amazing job but my favorite was Ellen.Her Dory was great.All of the characters were great to be honest. I loved them all. Another of my favorites was Mr.Ray. He wasn't around a lot but when he was he was a great presence on the screen. The dentist was hilarious as well as the tank friends. I think Dory is my favorite character. There are so many good things about this movie yet I'm having a hard time naming them all. The way the story was told way very well done. It flowed nicely and fit together perfectly. Not once did something feel out of place from scene to scene.,
862,2 September 2017,trevora_l,10, Amazing Movie,"loved this movie watch it over and over. I loved ""Finding Nemo"" as a child and could not wait for them to make a sequel! so happy that it was as good as this one! watch this movie at least 20 times a year. I first watched this movie as a child in theater and it has been a favorite ever since. i hope others enjoy this movie as much as myself. great movie to show off a good TV if you have the blue ray version.",
863,25 November 2005,falkor101,10, The best movie for a long time.,"Finding Nemo is the best movie i have seen since The Lion King. I'm only young and even though my 7 year old sister thinks its a kids movie i think its for all ages. It includes lots of different lines, comments and music from a range of different movies and the humour in it is very humorous for 4 year old kids through to 4000 yr old people.Andrew Stanton has done an excellent job in directing this hit. Another thing i absolutely love about it is the casters didn't choose the popular celebrities but used people who i never knew before this. They gave the chance of being famous and well known to people who are usually just stuck behind the scenes of movies. They used a range of different fish that fit into different stereotypes in our communities and our own lives in the modern times. Finding Nemo as well as Shrek and Shrek 2 are some of the most awesome movies that have being put out in the last decade.",
864,14 October 2017,edenjoi-88739,10, just as good as i remembered,"i know that i'm super late to the party, but this is one of the handful of movies that i grew up watching. maybe i'm biased to Disney/pixar movies, but finding nemo is just one of those films i can keep coming back to. if i'm in a bad mood, i can pop the disc into the DVD player with a sweet tea and some popcorn and relax. am i the only one who feels this way?",
865,10 December 2005,amythepure,10, finding Nemo was a great movie,"Finding Nemo was a great movie that people of all ages can enjoy! I couldn't stop watching it! I watched every day for almost a month! This movie is one of my all time favorites! I think the graphics made the whole movie even more enjoyable. The plot line was smart,interesting and kept viewers on the edge of their seats. The characters were all well rounded and very believable as well as lovable. My favorite character was Dory, a forgetful fish who is always optimistic. I really enjoyed the sharks and turtles as well. In my opinion this movie is perfect and i wouldn't change a thing! Well I guess i would give myself a part but thats all. :D I strongly recommend those who haven't seen this movie to do so as soon as possible!",
866,16 June 2018,contact-77448,10, Excellant children movie,My 4 year old son just loves this movie. He loves to watch your film over and over again. I just love how the fishes make friends and try to help each other. Nemo Dad keeps reminding him to be safe and other adult fishes remind the young fishes of the different dangers and to keep safe. They teach the kids if you lost someone to never give up hope and keep looking for them and one day you might be reconnected again someday. This is a excellent movie for all ages. Thanks for creating this film. My son and I just love your film. I saw this ounce in the theater. and watch it many times with my son at home.,
