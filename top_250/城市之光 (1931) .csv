0,12 September 2004,Quinoa1984,10," Lady and the Tramp, before animation and at the start of talkies- one of the most wonderful films ever conceived and executed","If there is one Charlie Chaplin film to recommend, as others have pointed to in the past, City Lights is the one. Though Chaplin played his Tramp character superbly in other movies, like Modern Times and The Gold Rush, City Lights displays the Tramp at his funniest, his bravest, his most romantic, and his most sympathetic. It's tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters, but it's pulled off. ",/
1,16 December 2005,EUyeshima,10, Chaplin's Masterpiece...and Oh Those Last Five Minutes!,"Let me join the consensus and call Charlie Chaplin's ""City Lights"" a masterpiece. It's only 81 minutes long, but they are among the best 81 minutes you could spend at the movies, and the last five minutes are simply exquisite. Keep your Kleenex box at arm's length as I doubt if there has been a more honestly heartbreaking scene captured on film. When the formerly blind girl gives the Little Tramp a flower and ultimately says ""Yes, I can see now"", the scene takes on such emotional gravity as to defy explanation.",r
2,22 December 2000,Anonymous_Maxine,10," You can't go wrong with Charlie Chaplin, but City Lights is even better than Chaplin's films usually are.","Chaplin takes himself a little more seriously in City Lights, and the results are spectacular. The musical score which Chaplin composed for the film was one of the many highlights, and even though Charlie's performance is much more dramatic than usual in some scenes, the hilarious comedy for which he is known and loved is still abundant.

A significant number of those films were written and performed by Charlie Chaplin and, if you watched nothing other than the films he made from that period, including this, your appreciation of his genius and talent would flower and grow, your vision of sincerity and generosity restore and your enchantment of the simpler and more genuine things in life embellish.",e
6,15 February 2003,lugonian,10, True Blind Love,"CITY LIGHTS (United Artists, 1931), written, directed and starring Charlie Chaplin (1889- l977), is a silent comedy-drama released at the height of the sound era. Distributing a movie in the silent film tradition at the time when silents were considered a fad, Chaplin gambled with this production, and made it pay off. Although Chaplin hails THE GOLD RUSH (1925) as the one movie he would most want to be remembered, CITY LIGHTS nearly dims out his GOLD RUSH and at the same time, practically places his other silent masterpiece, THE CIRCUS (1928) to oblivion. CITY LIGHTS has stood the test of time, balancing perfectly a mixture of comedy and drama, but in Chaplin's case, pathos.",w

10,19 September 2010,Steffi_P,10," ""Tomorrow the birds will sing""","The victory of the sound picture over the silent was a speedy and decisive one. The first full-length talkies were released in 1928. By 1929 theatres were being forced to convert to sound in order to stay in business. By 1930 silent film production by the major studios was completely discontinued and the medium became generally viewed as an anachronism. But in 1931 a new silent picture was released that, far from being an embarrassing failure, became the fourth-highest grossing picture of the year, being even more popular than such classics as the Bela Lugosi Dracula and The Public Enemy. The picture was City Lights and its producer, writer, director, editor, composer and star was Mr Charlie Chaplin.",4

13,13 January 2005,Rokol,9, Classic Chaplin,City Lights is simply put one of the best movies out there. Every scene is classic and had a huge impact on the history of film-making. Chaplin's last 'silent' film tells the story of a poor little man the tramp played by Chaplin who falls in love with a blind flower girl. He becomes friends with a wealthy man who constantly tries to commit suicide. The man only recognizes the tramp character when he is drunk. To impress the flower girl the tramp uses the man's wealth to make her fall in love with him. The only problem is that when the man is sober he doesn't recognize the tramp anymore. On top of this the flower girl has to pay 22 dollars of rent or she will be thrown out of her apartment. Now the tramp desperately seeks for jobs in the city to help his love. Out of this simple plot great comedy and heart breaking moments come forth.,3
14,20 June 2007,Petey-10,10, Looking for love...and happiness,"In the beginning you find our poor little tramp sleeping on a statue.Then he runs into a suicidal and drunken millionaire, whose life he saves.And what would our poor little tramp be without love? Even poorer and more miserable.The woman he falls for is a flower girl, and she's blind.And this blind flower girl thinks the tramp is a rich man.But he's only rich at heart.He wants to help the girl, he wants her to see.But if she does see, would she love him? Our poor little tramp? Nobody is better at combining tragedy and comedy better than Charles Chaplin was.This is a fact I have mentioned in previous Chaplin reviews and this is something all the movie lovers have probably noticed.City Lights (1931) is one great example of those movies where comedy meets tragedy.Take the scene with the Eccentric Millionaire for example.He is there ready to jump into the water when our little tramp wanders to the spot.Soon they're both in the water.Comedy meets tragedy, laughter meets tears.I could mention plenty of other examples but you can see it all by watching this movie.If you already have, watch it again.It's a true classic that will not age.And the acting performances...they're all superb.Besides Chaplin there is Virinia Cherrill as A Blind Girl.She is so beautiful...such a good actress.And then there's Florence Lee as her grandmother.Harry Myers is fantastic as the moody millionaire.And so is Al Ernest Garcia as his Butler.The Keystone Kop Hank Mann plays A Prizefighter.The big man Henry Bergman is known from other Chaplin films also.Here he plays the Mayor/Blind Girls downstairs neighbor.Jean Harlow can be seen as an Extra in restaurant scene.The original music made by Charlie himself is masterly.Chaplin didn't want to give up silent pictures.And why would he have? Things could very well be told without words.He did use some simple sound effects in this film and then Modern Times (1936).City Lights is filled with memorable scenes like when Charlie goes boxing.And when he goes dancing drunk is hilarious.And let's not forget the ending.The ending is beautiful.",1

17,5 March 2005,Captain_Couth,10, Top ten favorites. City Lights,City Lights (1931) is not only Charles Chaplin's great achievement but it also happens to be one of my top ten favorite films of all time. The emotion and effort that Chaplin put into this film cannot be recreated or matched by anyone. A classic tale about the Little Tramp giving up his livelihood for the benefit of others. Filmed during the height of the Great Depression the situation of life in America has never been caught like this before.,/
18,22 February 2014,SnoopyStyle,9, Iconic,"The lovable tramp (Charles Chaplin) loves the blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill). However through a series of misunderstandings, she thinks that he's actually a wealthy gentleman. He never dissuade her of the misconception. One night, he encounters a drunken wealthy gentleman (Harry Myers) who is about to commit suicide. The tramp rescues the drunk, and befriends him. However every time the rich drunk sobers up, he forgets about his tramp friend. When the blind girl needs $22 for rent, the tramp struggles to come up with the money. He even goes into a boxing match. Nothing works until he runs into the rich drunk once again. The drunk gives him $1000, but a misunderstanding makes the tramp a fugitive suspected of stealing the money. The tramp escapes and gives the blind guy all the money to pay the rent as well as fix her eyes. Later he is caught by the police and sent to jail. When he finally leaves the jail, he is in an even worst shape. The blind girl had her eyes fixed, and in a touching moment, she recognizes the tramp by feeling his hand.",?
19,15 May 2007,RainDogJr,10, CITY LIGHTS is a gift to all the people that loves CINEMA,"Charles Chaplin is one of those directors that you can't say easily what is his best film..........because nobody remember Chaplin with inly one film, because your say Chaplin and you don't think in only a film, no,you think of Chaplin like one of the greatest directors of all the history of the cinema. Chaplin is not only the teacher to all that new comedians, no he is a teacher and an inspiration to all who loves films because Chaplin is not only a comedian he is much more than that and City Lights is a gift to all the people in all the world that loves films. I love this film because contains elements of a comedy but also of a drama film. I think that have already says what i think about Chaplin, but the rest of the cast is really awesome. My favorite character in City Lights is of course The tramp but i love the personality of the eccentric millionaire, this character is a really good one in this film.",r
20,19 March 2011,classicsoncall,8," ""Tomorrow the birds will sing"".","To say that Charlie Chaplin was a perfectionist would be an understatement. The meeting of the flower girl in ""City Lights"" took over three hundred takes before it met Chaplin's approval; one of the many fascinating bits of history offered on the DVD extras I enjoyed today. Virginia Cherrill was a twenty year old, recently divorced socialite who didn't share Chaplin's work ethic and might have been replaced in the picture by Georgia Hale (""The Gold Rush"") if so much of the picture hadn't already been filmed. Knowing that, and re-watching some of the more poignant scenes in ""City Lights"", makes it seem all the more incredible for knowing that Chaplin and Cherrill didn't really like each other.",e

22,21 November 2010,jboothmillard,9, City Lights,"Sound was quickly taking over the film industry, and there was a lot of worry as to whether the star of such great silent classics like The Gold Rush and Modern Times could still make people sit through it, of course the answer was yes. Basically the Tramp (Sir Charlie Chaplin, also directing), broke and homeless, stops a drunk and Eccentric Millionaire (Harry Myers) committing suicide, and they become friends, well, at least until he sobers up. The two of them go drinking and partying together, the Millionaire even gives the Tramp his Rolls Royce, and one day walking the streets he meets a poor blind Flower Girl (Virginia Cherrill), and she believes him to be a millionaire, so he just goes along with this. To earn some money and help out his new love interest pay her overdue rent money, or face eviction from her apartment, the Tramp gets a job sweeping the streets, which he quickly loses. He is then approached by a man who offers him a high sum if he can beat another man in a boxing match, which of course the Tramp fails to win, and it looks like the poor Girl is to be evicted. However, the Tramp meets up with the Millionaire who cheerfully gives him a $1000, which can pay for both the rent, and an advertised eye operation for the Girl to gain her sight back. He is accused of stealing this money from the Millionaire and goes to jail, and months later when he released he searches for the Girl, who is looking for the Millioanire who has been so good to her. In the end the pair find each other, the Girl with her eye sight restored runs a flower shop with her Grandmother (Florence Lee), and seeing him she knows the Tramp isn't rich, but it doesn't matter, it is a happy ending as they both hold back tears. Also starring Allan 'Al' Ernest Garcia as the Butler and Hank Mann as A Prizefighter. Chaplin is still wonderful as the lovable Tramp with his slapstick comedy moments, great facial expressions and the famous waddle walk, and Cherrill makes a marvellous love interest. It is a beautifully told story with both very funny moments, but also surprisingly emotional scenes involving the tragic blindness using depths of pathos, a magnificent silent comedy romance. Sir Charlie Chaplin was number 50 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 24 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, he was number 38 on The World's Greatest Actor, and he was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 76 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 38 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Passions.

The iconic and everlasting character of The Tramp, one of the most lovable, truly human and sympathetic characters perhaps of all time. Sometimes there is some hate towards tramps, like they are labeled lazy and troublesome. It is very hard to hate The Tramp, because he gives so much when he has so little. He spends his time and money giving to people - whether it be saying a millionaires life or buying a flower from a blind girl. Undoubtedly, we all have a little bit of The Tramp in us.",t

As you can imagine, this added a tremendous amount to the overall effect of the movie, which I had seen once before on video. This is Chaplin at his most unabashedly sentimental, but darn it if it doesn't work like a charm. This feels the most dramatic of the Chaplin films I've seen, with the most ""plot,"" but that doesn't mean there aren't wildly funny bits, like Chaplin's brief stint as a boxer. I don't cry especially easily at movies, so the ending didn't have me in tears, but you're excused if it has that effect on you, and you might want to have a handkerchief handy just in case.",_
27,4 May 2015,anaconda-40658,10, Chaplin's Bright Lights.,"City Lights (1931): Dir: Charlie Chaplin / Dir: Charlie Chaplin, Virginia Cherrill, Harry Myers, Florence Lee, Al Ernest Garcia: A masterpiece in silent film expression of love, passion and the desire to merge forward through everyday corruption. Charlie Chaplin plays his trademark tramp who is sneered at by anyone who isn't blind or intoxicated. Virginia Cherrill plays a blind woman who sells flowers on the corner. Smitten, Chaplin purchases a flower. Harry Myers plays a drunken millionaire on the verge of suicide until Chaplin prevents it in his usual hilarious slapstick fashion. Thankful, he invites Chaplin to his mansion for partying. Unfortunately when sober he doesn't recall his new friend. This frustrates Chaplin who attempts odd jobs in order to help the blind woman with her rent as well as an expensive eye surgery that would gain her sight. This leads to more hijinks particularly when he makes a failed attempt at boxing. Chaplin plays off a desire to please despite the fact that the blind woman believes him to be rich. Cherrill as the blind woman proves to have a heart of gold. Florence Lee plays her concern grandmother who help her with the flowers arrangements. Myers plays off the recklessness of alcohol. Al Ernest Garcia plays the stern and often confused butler. Chaplin's best work presents a theme of putting the needs of others first as well as give the words of a touching closing line, ""I can see now."" Score: 10 / 10",u

30,13 February 2013,tomgillespie2002,10, The most satisfying cinematic experience I've ever had,"By 1930, the silent era was coming to a rapid end. All doubters thinking that the 'talkie' craze would not last were having a wake-up call, and silent geniuses such as Buster Keaton, Douglas Fairbanks, and Charlie Chaplin, were potentially seeing their highly successful careers melting away. Chaplin began work on City Lights back in 1928, yet a troubled and stressful shoot caused production to run until 1931, when Hollywood had all but given itself over to the new talkie era. Refusing to let go of his most famous creation, The Tramp, Chaplin endured with his vision and kept City Lights silent, seeing no hope for his beloved character in sound pictures. Chaplin shot sporadically, seemingly around one central, and very simple, idea, and managed to create his greatest work, and undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time.",

Comic scenes, sad scenes, everything is excellent and current, like a real piece of eternal art.

36,10 November 2010,mjneu59,10, a daring masterpiece,"Say what you want about his politics, his love life, his Victorian sentiment, or his overwhelming ego; if Charlie Chaplin had never made another film he would still be justifiably famous, not only for creating a masterpiece, but for single-handedly keeping the art of silent comedy alive long after its untimely death. It's ironic how the passing of silence liberated Chaplin to a point where he could fully express his pantomime genius and find, at long last, the elusive tertium quid between laughter and tears. Was there ever a more unpredictable companion than millionaire Harry Myers, matching the Little Tramp drink for drink until the sober light of dawn revealed the callous Jekyll behind his generous Hyde? And was there ever a more heartbreaking moment than the final, devastating close-up, when the once blind flower girl confronts the shabby vagabond she thought was her handsome young benefactor?

What can be more perfectly idyllic and altruistically beautiful than a movie about a big-hearted Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) who falls for a blind flower girl and tries in vain to raise money for an eye operation. The Tramp does so by depending on the largess of a carousing millionaire whose drunken debauchery at one point convinces the girl (Virginia Cherrill) that the Tramp is in-fact a wealthy benefactor and not just a homeless Tramp eager to find love.,

41,6 July 2011,crossbow0106,10, Unparalleled Brilliance,"Simply put, this is one of the greatest films of all time. Chaplin, playing the familiar tramp, meets a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) and is touched by her. He also meets a millionaire (Harry Myers) who only seems to be able to tolerate the tramp when he is drunk. The tramp looks to raise money to cure the girl's blindness. The film is funny, poignant and heartwarming. Its full of Chaplin like pratfalls and sight gags, but it also has a tenderness that is both welcome and inspired. A ""silent"" film (Chaplin composed the music, also wonderful), it just doesn't have any dialog. Its so much better for that, it means more. The last scene is probably the greatest in movie history, but watch the whole film and just get immersed in the artistry and brilliance that was Chaplin.",
42,26 December 2016,sharky_55,10, You?,"When City Lights started production in 1928 it was merely another Chaplin silent comedy, but after the turn of the new century it was the odd one out. Although The Jazz Singer provided a watershed moment for sound in film the year before, it contained only a few minutes of actual synchronised sound and still relegated most of its dialogue through traditional intertitles. By 1931, however, the majority of Hollywood had made the shift, ushering in the age of talkies and never looking back. It is no coincidence that Chaplin makes reference to his lone stand in the opening scene of the film, where dignified city officials host the unveiling of a new statue and attempt to address the adoring crowd, only to have their words morphed into screechy, kazoo-like nonsense (Donald Duck would come a few years later). The bit is more a playful wink and less a jab, as part of a wider career that demonstrated Chaplin's mastery of pantomime and its endurance well into the talkie era. The Tramp's mere presence upsets the proceedings, and they all rush to capture him, but not before they freeze in the insanity to salute the national anthem and flag. ",
43,3 November 2008,CitizenCaine,10, Chaplin's Masterpiece Of Comedy & Pathos,"Chaplin edited, wrote, directed, and produced City Lights over a three year period. He initiated the film just before releasing The Circus, and he released it in January of 1931. Talking pictures were all the rage at the time, having been in vogue for a few years at this point, so it's no surprise that Chaplin at least added sound to City Lights, albeit in a limited capacity. The film is deceptively simple both in its plot and in its construction. Chaplin the perfectionist used hundreds of takes once again to get scenes right. As in The Gold Rush and in The Circus, Chaplin used an unknown female for the lead: Virginia Cherrill, who would become one of Cary Grant's wives a few years later. City Lights was Cherrill's debut film, and she and Chaplin did not get along. Chaplin even tried to replace her with Georgia Hale, his lead from The Gold Rush, before realizing it wouldn't be practical. Oddly enough, Cherrill's career lasted only fourteen films.",

45,17 August 2007,SmileysWorld,9, Another gem from a hard nosed genius.,"Charlie Chaplin,I have heard through various sources,was a hard nosed perfectionist to the point of being downright disliked by some.He was not only the main star of his feature films,he was the creative mastermind behind the scenes as well.He wrote as well as directed.I have a hard time with anyone that difficult and based on what I have learned,probably would not have gotten along with Mr. Chaplin.Even so,I feel that his films are regarded as great because of his hard nosed attitude.Everything had to be perfect and everyone involved must know it.City Lights is another gem born of this hard nosed genius.We have our beloved little tramp making the acquaintance of a blind flower girl.Their meeting is comical,yet sweet.He falls in love immediately as does she.Through his comical,alcohol induced friendship with a millionaire who is down with life,he finds himself taking on the appearance that he is wealthy when he,in fact,is not.His love for this girl runs so deep that he is willing to do anything for her.Anything,that is,except reveal to this girl what he is in reality,fearing her love would fade.City Lights is another masterpiece of comedy laced with tender romantic sweetness from Charlie Chaplin,the hard nosed perfectionist.",
46,22 January 2017,Hitchcoc,10, The Epitome of Chaplin,"In this film we have an overriding story. It is the story of a blind flower girl who is approached by a little tramp and who accepts him as a worthwhile human being, because she can't see his tattered clothes and sad being. He is compassionate and loving and giving to others, and yet he is despised by the haves. He is under constant attack from kids in the street, and the law won't leave him alone. When he prevents the suicide of a rich man, he is taken in, but because the man is a drunk, when sober he doesn't even recognize the little tramp.

47,29 May 2019,RossRivero99,10, A Chaplin masterpiece,"I haven't seen that many silent movies in my lifetime but I have seen enough to know that everytime I see a silent movie with Charlie Chaplin I always know that I'm going to be in for a lot of laughs along the way. The movie is part a long stretch of movies where Chaplin plays his beloved tramp character who doesn't go without his wild adventures in the city, but in this movie he meets and eventually falls in love with a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) who lives with her grandmother (Florence Lee) and their living situation isn't the best in the world by living in a crappy apartment. Meanwhile The Little Tramp meets a rich man (Harry Myers) who is trying to kill himself because he is all torn up over the end of his marriage and feels as if he has no more purpose in this world and ends up getting his life saved by Chaplin and to show his gratitude he wants to be friends for life with the Tramp. then there is a scene in the movie where the tramp is at the girl's house and they're just talking and he finds an eviction notice in the record player that her grandmother left in there so no one would know, opens the letter and reads it to the girl while breaking down in tears as he's reading it, he then cheers her up and offers to pay the rent but he does more than that by also paying for her to get an eye operation so that she can see. I have watched four Chaplin films so far with the other three being ""The Kid"" (1921), ""The Gold Rush"" (1925), and ""Monsieur Verdoux"" (1947) and with all of these films the one thing that each of them have in common is that they are all masterpieces. Chaplin along with Stanley Kubrick and Akira Kurosawa was a notorious perfectionist and settled for nothing but the best by any means necessary which a prime example would be when he fired the actress who played the blind girl in this movie only to hire her again. The movie has been remembered as a true classic and still holds up with cinephiles everywhere and filmmakers praising such as Orson Welles calling it his favorite movie of all time and Woody Allen saying that it's Chaplin's best movie. The best thing about Chaplin's movies is not only that he can make you laugh real hard every chance he gets but he can also balance that with brilliant dramatic elements which is what made the greatest filmmaker of the silent era.",
48,23 March 2005,ALauff,8, Simple and selfless and deeply moving,"The tramp tries to nurture and help a blind flower girl regain sight despite scant resources and the prejudices and graft of the big city. Although the physical gags lack the large-scale invention of the factory scenes in Modern Times and the criticism of the wealthy doesn't transcend an admittedly witty recurring jokethe aristocrat friend can only demonstrate compassion and friendliness in an inebriated state; he's always inviting the tramp in, only to incredulously throw him out the next sober morningthe tramp's touching earnestness in rescuing his angel from a life of abjection is simple and selfless and deeply moving. I would say it also fades out at the perfect moment of open-ended ambiguitythe viewer is forced to make resonant meaning out of the final troublingly cathartic shot, even as the film articulates a consistent worldview in relation to what has come before. In my eyes, Modern Times is Chaplin's masterpiece, but City Lights would probably better merit repeat viewings, which is as much a testament to the film's power as anything else.",

I will say that Modern Times is the most accessible of these three to the current film-goer because it's the one which uses sound most extensively, and that The Gold Rush has more classic comedic bits, but for me it's always been City Lights, as this is the film that strikes the best balance of slapstick and pathos together, where you're laughing one moment, and then greatly moved in another.",

In my opinion, it tops even the brilliant Modern Times.  It seems to me that many who claim to be film ""connoseuirs"" stick up their noses at anything that does not have excessively complicated plots or incomprehensible imagery.  To these people I would say, ""I feel sorry that you are unable to appreciate some of the greatest works of art ever created"".  This movie is a nearly ideal case in point.  The story is simple: the Tramp falls in love with a blind flower girl and does anything to help her.  Although there are some very funny moments, the movie is not really what I would call hilarious.  But I don't see these as flaws.  The very simplicity of the story gives it enormous impact because it obviously comes straight from the heart, and the humor is present to soften the blow of the drama and make it bearable, the exception being the very end.  Much has been said about the ending, and deservedly so.  There is nothing outlandish, nothing over the top about it: everything is very subtle, but the way that it is set up, the subtle facial expressions, the lack of dialogue, and the music all have the impact of a sledgehammer.  It has to be seen to be believed.  I don't want to reveal any more details for fear of spoiling it.

69,4 November 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9, City Lights is sure to brighten up your day.,"Having not much experience with silent films, this is admittedly my first venture into Chaplin's filmography. A renowned master and auteur during the 20's and 30's. Suffice to say after just one film, I can whole heartedly state that the man was a comedic genius. This puts all modern comedies to shame. I laughed more watching this classic than I have done all year, and that in itself proves that this 1931 silent masterpiece has stood the test of time. A tramp encounters an enigmatic blind woman who he tries to impress. In doing so, he befriends a turbulent alcoholic millionaire and starts to utilise his wealth to win her over. It's easy to dismiss Chaplin's films as slapstick humour. An array of silly sketches stringed together to evoke laughter. This dismissal is unjustified. There is a reason why City Lights is regarded as one of the best of all time, because it makes you experience a variety of emotions. The romance between the tramp and the woman is sweet and tender. The commentary on alcoholism, although not as thematically powerful as one would've hoped for, makes for adequate drama. The misfortunes of the tramp, particularly the swallowing of the whistle and well-choreographed boxing match, create the expected humour. Then the touching final scene adds a sprinkle of melodrama to surmise the story in two minutes. It's a tale about kindness. Being a gentleman no matter how small or large your bank account is. Aside from the overlong boxing match preparation scene, which should've been shortened to keep the pace up, I found no faults. The amount of personality seeping through the screen from the characters was astonishing. Nearly every scene felt fresh, introducing new and innovative gags to maintain the hilarity. The exaggerated acting assisted in producing chemistry between the characters. Briskly paced, consistently funny and just enough drama to retain viewer engagement. City Lights is (so far) the best silent film I have seen, and a true testament to the power of silence in an era where ""talkies"" were prevalent.",

76,1 March 2008,zardoz-13,10, Chaplin's Crowning Masterpiece of Silent Cinema!,"The transition from silent films to talkies proved devastating for many movie stars. Some with thick European accents, like Teutonic actor Emil Jannings who won the first Best Acting Oscar, did not weather the conversion and returned to Germany. The silent clowns who practiced the art of pantomime became one group adversely affected by the advent of sound. Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd emerged as the first casualties of the talkies. Meanwhile, Chaplin had nothing but contempt for sound films. ""Motion pictures need dialogue as much as Beethoven symphonies need lyrics,"" he said. Indeed, Chaplin saw few advantages to sound, despite the sensation that the new technology created for the industry. Warner Brothers introduced sound pictures in 1927 with its quasi-talkie The Jazz Singer, and sound propelled Warners into the big leagues with exalted studios like MGM and Paramount. Chaplin did not rush to climb aboard the sound movie bandwagon. Instead, he hoped that City Lights would revive silent movies. As the popularity of sound waxed, Chaplin grew more anxious about sound. Nevertheless, he produced his greatest silent movie comedy City Lights in 1931. He took into account, however, the impact of sound and added a synchronized soundtrack as well as his own post-production musical score. Chaplin remained reluctant to convert to sound. When he made his next classic comedy Modern Times (1936), he made it as a silent. Eventually, Chaplin converted to sound with his classic anti-Hitler film The Great Dictator in 1940. Chaplin's dismissal of sound grew out of his success as a mime. The former English music hall pantomimist created his life-long comic persona--the 'little tramp'--for the 1914 silent comedy The Kid Auto Races at Venice. Chaplin rose through the ranks at various studios until his success with the little tramp enabled him to finance his own studio. Chaplin's mute tramp appealed to everybody everywhere because body language constituted an international language. Asian audiences appreciated Chaplin's comic body language as much as Scandinavians. ""My own pictures will always be silent,"" he assured his audiences. Although he added a synchronized sound track, Chaplin ridiculed talkies in City Lights. In the opening scene, when dignitaries dedicate a monument to 'Peace and Prosperity,' Chaplin pokes fun at these pretentious people with his use of squawky sound effects. ""City Lights"" qualifies as a sweetly sentimental saga about Chaplin's trademark 'little tramp' character in his tattered evening clothes and a hat falling hopeless in love with a beautiful but blind flower girl played by Virginia Cherrill. Meanwhile, when the Tramp isn't buying flowers from the heroine and escorting her back to where she lives with her grandmother, he strikes up an on-and-off friendship with a real millionaire. According to the credits, mustached Harry Myers of ""Getting Gertie's Garter"" (1927) plays an 'eccentric millionaire.' He is eccentric because he lives alone without his wife and has only his butler to care for him. Unhappy, the millionaire either tries to commit suicide or gets plastered and goes from one party to another, even hosting them at his mansion. The Tramp runs into him late one evening when the Millionaire tries to commit suicide by drowning himself. The Tramp gets soaked for saving his new found friend and the friend reciprocates and becomes the Tramp's long-lost friendthat isuntil he sobers up and has no memory of their friendship.",

It can be seen in his movies that Chaplin carries meanings in his roles and this movie is about loving someone more than you love yourself. It's about how a kind man remains kind regardless of the mistreatment that come his way. It's about how love for someone can provide purpose and meaning in someone's life.

Regarded by most as Chaplin's best work, City Lights has some of the Tramp's funniest and most heartfelt moments. In a more developed storyline than usual, the tramp falls in love with a blind flower girl who mistakes him for a rich man. While this situation provides the emotional drive of the film, the Tramp's relationship with a rich, suicidal drunkard provides most of the laughs. Both plot lines intertwine perfectly, complementing each other well. In the third act, the Tramp sets out to raise money for an operation on the blind girl. After loosing his job as a street sweeper, he enters a boxing match to try and win the prize money. The hilariously choreographed match is one of Chaplin's best routine's ever. As much as it makes us laugh, it still tugs at our heart strings when the Tramp surprisingly goes down for the count. The final scene in which the girl with her restored sight realizes that the Tramp is her benefactor is a study in bittersweet. Chaplin and the girl wisely underplay the moment, keeping it from being too sappy, but still making us care. What happens next is also wisely left to the imagination.",

Nowhere is he more touching than when he says ""Tomorrow the birds will sing"" to talk a man out of committing suicide, or that final scene, which is stunning.

134,2 January 2021,nukisepp,8, Real love needs no words.,"To most 'City Lights' is their favorite Charles Chaplin movie. It is said to be the great auteur's personal favorite amongst his movies. I might be the rare individual in this case - 'City Lights' is not my favorite for some reason. Although, I can consider this as his BEST movie. Perhaps, because here the Tramp character is most nuanced than ever. And the writing is the most complex and complete Chaplin has ever achieved. Physical comedy is precise - just look at that fight scene (I wonder, were Buster Keaton jealous of that?). There aren't many stand-alone gags, every joke is there to move forward the story or develop the character. Funny and touching, but the most important is (one of) the message the movie carries - only an outcast can help an outcast. Psychologically and philosophically 'City Lights' is much more complex than its slapstick exterior shows at the first glance. The pantomime only enhances the magical fairytale feel - the real love never needs words. In 'City Lights' the Tramp is at his most romantic adventure ever, where he shows utmost bravery and selflessness. He doesn't only try to help his love interest, a blind flower girl (ever so charming Virginia Cherrill), but he also puts his own life on the line to save a millionaire (Harry Myers makes convincing alcoholic and is funny in his own right) from suicide, although, when sobered up, the millionaire doesn't want to make any dealings with the Tramp.

138,19 February 2021,judemcrobbie,9, Chaplin's best,"For me this is Chaplin's best movie because of the more connected story and overall film making, from the foreshadowing and call back and other techniques that have translated to today.
Has a darker tone than the majority of Chaplin's movies, dealing with suicide as a lot device but except that there isn't much else.
Has the usual hilarity of his movies, from the cap flip greeting to the the iconic walk. But this movie contains much more complex and developed comedy than the rest of his movies, making for a better laugh that will definitely stick with you for longer.
Two of the scenes in this film are probably two of the funniest Chaplin scenes and probably some of the funniest ever.
These scenes are:
The opening scene, which has this hilarious robotic feel to it with him feeling the need to repeat the action of saying hello to everyone and everything. The is has a sense of idiocy and lack of mediocrity throughout causing you to belt out with laughter.
The other scene is the scene in the boxing ring. The hilarity of this scene comes from the role reversal, and every time that one of the boxers has to break up the clinch between the referee and the other boxer, I laugh so hard.
This movie has surprising depth as well, being a criticism of capitalist society. The theme in this is so clear and obvious that a child could understand it. Maybe don't show this to a child as the silence might be a little boring, I know as a child I wouldn't have been able to sit through it, but as a teenager I couldn't recommend it more.
As with all of the Chaplin movies, his acting is less acting and more a well performed and choreographed dance or mime showing and conveying a very clear and obvious narrative.
The only thing holding this movie back is the score. Considering the emotional investment the score brings in these movies, I don't think its quite up to scratch and definitely worse than modern times. This is. A huge shame as everything about this movie has aged better than modern times, predominantly the jokes.

One day he follows her home(a little creepy) but he over hears that she doesn't have enough for her rent so we get to go on this wild goose chase. He gets into a fighting ring because him and the guy were gonna go 50/50 split. Well like every great chaplin movie it goes wrong. Very wrong and we see him end up fighting this guy who could easily kill someone with one hit. Well lets say he doesn't get the money because instead of taking 1250 and walking away with enough to pay her rent he ends up with nothing. So we go on another goose chase. The thing that stuck out to me was the ending and how emotional it was. After he gets out of jail he goes to see her again and she doesn't recognize him. It hits you like the end of furious 7, hard and heavy. The greatest thing about this is that he didn't even have to talk.

With that said, the humor is still genius (that boxing scene is still one of the best comedic sequences).

His ability to evoke emotion was extraordinary, and he knew how to tell a story! Actor, writer, director, producer, composer; it was not unlike Chaplin to do it all in his movies, but to do all of these, and to do them so brilliantly - it can only be described as genius. This film, is a wonderful place to start for anyone interested in the work of Charles Chaplin. While I feel that The Gold Rush is the better film, I would still recommend this just as quickly. It contains the wonderful sight gags, pratfalls, and classic comedy for which Chaplin's films are so renowned. From the opening scene, the unveiling of the monument, you know that you are in for a treat. The film is not all comedy, though. There is romance and drama as well. Yet, this is where this film shines so brightly; it IS comedy, it IS romance, and it IS drama. All three genres are presented here, purely, and yet, they are intertwined so exquisitely that the viewer hardly realizes the shifts in emotion!

The girl is blind and poor, the TrampChaplinis poor, in love, and wants to help the blind girl. The Millionaire can help the tramp out by giving him money, but he is an on-again, off-again friend depending on whether or not he is drunk.",

168,10 March 2017,djayesse,10, The silent film testament,"This is certainly one of the most sensual films of all time. Chaplin turned in it a festival of senses. - Smell: no real reference, but something puzzles me when the elephant crosses the screen (and the street). - Taste: this is a film where they eat a lot. They eat spaghetti in the restaurant; they eat at the rich man's house; the tramp eats his lunch; and of course, he brings food to the girl. - Hearing: she hears him passing by, although he tries to be silent. Then she (thinks she) hears him leave in the car. When the statue is revealed, people are talking in a microphone. But we do not understand a thing. Only the tone of the voices are recognizable: a low tone for the man, a high-pitched tone for the woman. This was also the occasion to make fun of the talkies, Chaplin remaining a silent movie director. Nevertheless, Chaplin uses sounds to increase his comical effects: when he swallows spaghetti, or blows against his will the whistle, the boxing gong... - Touch: this is the sense of communication for the girl. This is how she knows who she is talking to. This is also by touching him that she realizes that he is the man who looked after her. The first time she meets him, she touches his jacket put a flower in his buttonhole. This is also the same thing she does when they finally meet. She wants to give him a flower and money, but he refuses. By touching, one last time, his jacket, she recognizes him, and is filled with emotion (who would not be?). - Sight: the most important sense, of course. First, we watch. And what do we watch? A blind girl. She has an empty look when we meet her. When he talks to her, he cannot help miming his words. Of course, it is for us spectators that he makes all these gestures. But he is also very enthusiastic when he talks, so he has to mime everything he says. And when he leaves her, he cannot help spying on her through the window, standing on a barrel. Finally, their last look at each other is one of the most moving I have ever seen. She is sad (is she disappointed?), he seems half-sad/half-annoyed by this situation.",

I watched it, as if I was hypnotized and when the movie was finished I found myself thinking ""Now that's a nice movie!"" I believe the mark of any truly great film is the emotion it's able to evoke.

The plot contrivance of the ""Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde"" personality of the millionaire is sheer genius.  Others have spoke of the artisty of the boxing match, but my favorite scene is where Charlie, while driving the millionaire's car, sees a discarded cigar butt on the sidewalk.  Before he can get to it, a panhandler happens by and leans down to pick it up.  Charlie dispatches him with a kick in the pants, grabs the cigar butt and jumps back into his luxury automobile.  He leaves the bewildered panhandler scratching his head, wondering why a wealthy man would be so mean as to snatch a discarded butt from the curb.  Of course, if one is aware of the grinding poverty Chaplin endured while growing up in south London and of his stingy reputation with a buck, the joke is all the more significant.

Chaplin plays a Tramp who falls in love with a blind girl who believes he is a rich man. He then saves a rich mans life, who proceeds to pay him money on multiple occasions. The Tramp gives the girl this money to save up for an operation that can bring back her sight. What follows is an emotional rollercoaster of a movie that fills you with laughter and sadness. This really is Chaplin at his best. This film was made in 1931, when movies had sound in them and a lot of companies were now producing talkies, rather than silent movies. Chaplin, thinking that sound would be a killer of the industry, decided to make City Lights a silent film anyway. Whilst he may have been wrong about sound being the end of the movie industry, this film being made as a silent movie was a very good idea. I really enjoyed the way he incorporated tiny bits of sound into his humour. One of the scenes involved him swallowing a whistle and every time he breathed out, he let out a toot.",
200,6 February 2011,baroudii,9, Intellectual,"The movie is a brilliant movie with simple approach, face expressions and body language delivered the message louder than words. Charlie Chaplin manages to expose the contrast in our lives between rich and poor and between dreams and reality. The first point has been delivered in the first seen, when group of politicians were celebrating a monument that has been built by donated money. Charlie Chaplin (a homeless man) was sleeping under the cover of the statue. This seen highlighted the contrast between money spent for cosmetic projects that does not add any value to eliminate hanger and improve the life of the neediest parts of the community. The message is that we are spending money and willing to provide funding for project that at most just cosmetic, and ignore funding to fight hunger, homelessness and curable diseases in our own backyard in the US. We see the same today, almost seventy years after the movie. The willingness to spend many billions on wars, supporting dictators, stadiums, art, and music, on the other hand, the community organized huge resistance to provide health care service for every American. The movie continued to highlight the wide gap between the rich and the poor in our community. The movie showed how a $10 can buy whole day worth of work for the blind girl and send her home for the day. The rich mane has many of those bills in his pocket as pocket cash. The same point is emphasized when the drunk rich man wanted to help and offered a $1000 to help. This amount of money was part of the pocket cash again. The movie proceed to show that portion of the rich man pocket cash was able to keep the blind lady and her old grandmother at their rented home, and cure her vision in addition to opening her own flower shop. The idea of just a portion of a pocket cash of someone can make this huge impact on someone else life is sad reality. It applies to all of us today, the few dollars we spend every day on coffee, cigarettes, and other unessential expenses can make huge difference in someone else life, in this country and in other countries. The culture of spending money we don't have to buy things we will never use is a very well established culture, proved by a simple trip to the nearest Costco or mall. The rich man drives a Rolls Royce (that he was willing to give it as gift in exchange for few happy moments with his ""friend"" Charlie Chaplin) and he has several servants at his home. The movie succeeded in denying the association between money and happiness. The rich man was not happy and was trying to end his own life; however, unintentionally he was able to introduce major happiness to others. The fact that he was drunk when he offered the money is an indicator that people are good when they are at their simplest form, and turn to monsters when they are back to their complicated personality.",

203,6 January 2020,Horst_In_Translation,6," Fairly entertaining, but not one of the best","""City Lights"" is an American silent film from 1931, so this one is almost 90 years old now, although ""silent"" is a bit relative in this scenario because there is a defined soundtrack by Chaplin and he said he does not want this film shown with different kind of music, but yeah as for talking and sound effects, it is of course a silent movie. Unlike other Chaplin films this one does not seem to have many different versions (according to imdb at least) and it runs for slightly under 90 minutes. Of course it is in black-and-white. And this is once again 100% about Chaplin, but let me still say a few words on the supporting cast. His female lead, i.e. love interest, is played by Virginia Cherrill who was still very young when this was made and retired from the film industry before her 30th birthday, but led a long life afterwards. The actress who palyed her mother, however, did not get this old and died less than 5 years after this was made, way before WWII. This is a Chaplin movie that does not play way back in the past, like the days of the Gold Rush for example. It is set in the city approximately during the time when it was made as we can easily see when watching this film. And while I do think that this is all about Chaplin at the center of the film/action, I still think he is best when he interacts with people that he really only shares pretty much one scene with most of the time, like the guy whose bald head he mistakes for food. Or the dude who is making a sandwich and Chaplin mistakes one ingredient for soap. Or of course the boxing fight now that was hilarious with the referee constantly in the way between them. It never got old despite how long they used this running gag. Well with how fast they were moving, it was really a running gag and Chaplin (forgive me for saying his name instead of ""the Tramp"") sure knew how to make the most of it. He may not have had the strength, but he had the quickness. And still he lost the fight in the end, which as the expected outcome for the bookmakers probably, but not for the audience in my theater, who was clearly surprised that our hero came short. But it is a nice inclusion of realism I must say. What was also fun were the scenes before the fight when Chaplin using another guy's lucky charm to its full extent, but when he saw that guy got quite a beating he really tries to get all the lucky charm away from him because clearly it wasn't working.",

He met a blind flower girl and fell in love with her, always hoping to do something for her. One day, he rescued a rich man who was trying to jump into a river. The man who was in a daze exchanged drinks with him. After a good time, he gave his car and some money to the tramp. The tramp with this small money and flower girl spent a short happy time, he more want to cure the eyes of the sweetheart, do not want to return to god in the rich in the tramp look down on the butler cuanduo do not recognize the savior, and at this time flower girl rent due, facing difficulties. So, the tramp went for broke, in various ways trying to raise money for the flower girl, even thin arms and legs he would go to the boxing ring to fight. The story here has been a steady progress of joy. Although there are adventures and accidents, the tramp always lives a calm and optimistic life, quietly making the flower girl happy and working hard for her. Despite his devotion to the flower girl, the tramp takes on a low-key, selfless form, such as rolling up wool for her. Even though the flower girl mistakenly wraps all his sweaters around him, he doesn't say a word, and the comedy scene brings out the essence of his kindness. I have seen too many fanatical films showing love, but the subtle but essentially rich love in this film makes people feel warmer than the hysterical love that shouts ""XX, I can't leave you"".",

Chaplin knew that a film consisting in only sketches would not cope with the new films so he had to introduce a story that would unify the film from beginning to end. Hence City Lights was the first Chaplin film with a decisive argument and thanks to its enormous success, for a short time, Hollywood returned to make silent films but sound had come to stay.

The story may be considered silly or simple to the modern viewer, but this film has humor, it has heart, and it has drama.

In City Lights, the best of Chaplin's works, the little tramp is mistaken for a rich man by a blind girl, and taken under the wing of a millionaire, and he does quite well in his new rich life, although he is a tramp.

The ""talkie"" movement started in 1928 and older silent movies became almost obsolete, City Lights proved that to be wrong.

225,13 November 2018,francpsantos,10, A pure ode to sincerity to others and to oneself,"If there were any doubts that Charlie Chaplin was way ahead of many of his contemporaries, this work of art will shed them away. The man did it all, and did it expertly. The classic comedic gags are not scarce in the movie and they are great as well. The comedy may not be extremely witty or even funny by today's standards, but honestly, it manages to bring a smile to my face quite frequently. A special nod to the box fight scene, which manages not only to be a smart piece of practical comedy, but also an uneasy moment, because of how much is a stake. You can't help but to feel yourself so expectant and deeply involved that it almost as if you forget the silliness of the situation for a moment. The personal interactions, in my opinion, are also undeniable proof of Chaplin's genius. Be it the interesting intermittent relationship between the Tramp and the millionaire or the tender affection between a blind woman selling flowers and a lowlife with ragged clothes. Chaplin's character is someone who is used to be looked from above, and his sincere happiness is truly poetic, when he finds gratitude from someone who, ironically, can see behind his flawed facade. That's why, to me, it came as shock when I read about the tense relationship between Chaplin and Cherrill and how she got fired from the production at some point. The connection between their characters just oozes out of the screen, in such a way that it seems unbelievable that, actually, it was almost the opposite in ""real life"". On top of all that, for the ones that find silent movies scary, rest assured that the score (composed by Chaplin himself) fits the tone of each scene so perfectly, that, a few minutes in, one already forgets that this is not a 'talkie'. I grant it that the ""speech sounds"" at the first scene of the movie are somewhat off-putting but, luckily, they do not appear for the rest of the movie, and the rest of the sound design is actually pretty well done.",

Both Chaplin's directing and score are marvelous. The way Chaplin brought the character of the tramp to the canvas once more can hardly be topped, presenting such a precise yet relaxed kind of acting to the viewers. Virginia Cherrill, his love interest, is just wonderful. Hard to believe that she and Chaplin could not stand each other, as the story goes. A movie to be watched again and again and again...",

Specially with all this rush of modern times (to quote another Chaplin movie), it feels good to watch a movie that is not very mentally demanding. The plot could be followed by a five-year old, which is also a breath from all the complicated, deep movies I've been watching recently. And yes, it has some very funny parts, though it seems that the whole plot was written by putting together a bunch of gags that Chaplin had thought about, with no connexion whatsoever but that he made an effort to making them look somehow of a coherent story.

It is strange though that Chaplin's 3 greatest works came after he was deemed obsolete, but being the artistic Luddite, he was. He pushed forward and did not allow modern technology to steal his craftsmanship. In a way, you must applaud that, but at the same time from a critical analysis standpoint, you must also detract marks for it. For is it genius?

237,23 July 2009,raptorclaw,10, A truly universal masterpiece - one of cinema's greatest stars in his greatest ever picture,"People say a lot of things about Chaplin's immortality. Actually, they say only one thing many times, over and over again: he is eternal, his films will live forever, a hundred or two hundred years from now humanity will still turn to Charles Chaplin for joy and relief from whatever burdens they may have, as like or unlike our own as those may be. My gut tells me there is truth in this belief, but I don't think with my gut. To be honest, I am not that optimistic. And my doubts don't spring from common sense, either; common sense says, of course, someday everything disappears - so will Chaplin. But other than that, I, as a 17-year-old, know absolutely no one of a similar age that likes Chaplin or remembers having seen any of his movies in recent times. All kids in Pakistan used to see them, and maybe they still do, but no one bothers to stick to it as the years pass. Tom and Jerry et al are still on TV - their place in public consciousness is continuously reinforced; they can legitimately claim timelessness. But what about all the 17-year-olds that would rather watch 'Transformers' and have only dim memories of a funny little man in a shabby top hat, ones that like movies only in passing, without passion? How will these poor people - and they are poorer for it - find 'City Lights'? This is a truly magnificent film. Its enduring greatness (if not enduring popularity) can, of course, be attributed to nostalgia - but only in part. You need never have heard of Charlie Chaplin to enjoy it. It also has the common advantage of all silent films in that it knows no linguistic boundaries; the story, unlike that of a Buster Keaton film, is simple and silent enough that one does not really need even the sparse title cards to follow it. Keaton's films, while silent, tended to be rather talkative, requiring the viewer to do quite a bit of reading. Chaplin is perhaps more widely known than Keaton because he, unlike the latter, can be understood by people who cannot read English or any language at all.",

239,27 November 2019,spcarroll-74629,8, Good slapstick; Good plot,"While City Lights is mostly a slapstick comedy filled of gags, putting its protagonist in multiple scenarios that alone are essentially skits it as a whole tells a story that is compelling through the lense of any time period. Most importantly, the gags do not undermine the fact that director and star Charlie Chaplain knows how to tell a narrative in a manner that where the plot is truly universal, allowing for a wide range of people to enjoy this film in multiple different countries and languages.
At the start of the story the Tramp(Charlie Chaplain) is simply trying to enjoy life to its fullest with no regard for others, resting on statues during public openings, testing for people's disabilities etc. However, as all love stories go, he finds the woman, played by Virginia Cherill, of his dreams and through that his character arc begins. He enters numerous jobs and pulls multiple hijinxs, which ends up in a lot(stressing a lot) of visual gags,in attempts to gain the woman money to afford, and eventually fix her eyes.
It is hard not to see the change in the character in time goes by with him starting out as the lazy man previously described, takes a small bit of advantage of a drunk millionaire, played by Al Ernest Garcia, but eventually turns to self reliance once he realizes that the Woman needs help.

Then again, Charlie Chaplin was a legend when it came to making these types of films. The Little Tramp is such an iconic character, even to this day, nearly a century after the Tramp was born in the mind of Chaplin. Chaplin knew how to work with the silent film format to deliver a moving, yet hilarious film. I never knew a silent film would be capable of having me bowled over in laughter. Yet, here we are. There is a reason why critics lauded City Lights as Chaplin's best film. I still think Modern Times is slightly better, but this 1931 feature is right up there. Some of the scenes are just so funny. My favorite sequence, which I am sure others can agree, is the boxing sequence. The Tramp uses a weird choreography to befuddle his opponent and the referee...while having the audience laugh their minds out. I also adored that spaghetti sequence. Finally, when compared to earlier films, Chaplin uses romance more effectively. Throughout the picture, it was easy to fall for a possible romance between the Tramp and the Blind Woman. The ending is heartfelt, moving, and one that is bound to put a smile on your face...even for the most cynical.",

He's literally unveiled in the opening scene. It doesn't have much baring on the story, a mere appetiser to ease us in, before we get to the famous flower girl scene and The Tramp falls in love. He does this a lot doesn't he, but he's so sweet. As is his source of affection, the blind girl (Virginia Cherrill), beautiful but lonely... a bit like The Tramp. There is a bit more filler in City Lights, budgets were getting bigger, as does the cast and the sets. It all still works though as The Tramp meets and saves a millionaire (Harry Myers) at the end of his rope. He's a flamboyant drunk, perfect for Chaplin to play off of. They're both quick to defend each other's honour, getting into scrapes at parties and running around town on the millionaire's dime. Until he once more runs into the girl and she again mistakenly takes him for a richer man, but falls for him. Does she love the man or the money? When The Tramp's wealthy friend sobers up, he's a different man. Leaving The Tramp to find ways of helping the girl who's luck is going from bad to worse. Of course, each opportunity giving Chaplin the chance to raise his slapstick game. Soon though, The Tramp realises that the situation with the girl is more desperate than he thought. This is the thing about these films, yes they're funny, light in tone on the surface, but they're brimming with heart. The Tramp is the epitome of that heart, he's selfless, willing to take on any cause and willing to go the distance, even putting himself in danger in the boxing ring against a ruthless prizefighter and giving up he's freedom over a misunderstanding with the law. I'm typical fashion it goes round the houses to reach it's inevitable end, but the finale will melt your heart. I've not found anything to match The Kid yet, but this comes close.",

The emotion and effort that Chaplin put into this film cannot be recreated or matched by anyone. A classic tale about the Little Tramp giving up his livelihood for the benefit of others. Filmed during the height of the Great Depression the situation of life in America has never been caught like this before.,

This movie is about a Tramp that falls in love with a blind flower girl.  She thinks that the Tramp is rich but he really just has a millionaire friend that he mooches off of.  Well, as you will see, he will do anything for this girl. He even resorts to fighting to raise money for her to pay the rent.  The conclusion is one of the best that I have ever seen.

His films are so sweet and hopeful and this one is no less so. The romance between him and the flower girl is perfect and all done without a sound. The emotions he shows in scenes with her are amazing and contagious. And of course the comedy still holds up. The drunk and boxing scenes had me grinning and laughing the whole time.

It is even credited as a ""Comedy Romance"" in the opening credits, and is among the very first of the genre. Chaplin, in his persona of The Tramp (replete with disconcertingly Hitler-y moustache), falls in love with a beautiful flower seller (Virginia Sherrill). She is blind, and mistakes him for a wealthy benefactor. Across the course of their love story, the Tramp goes from low to high to low to very low and ultimately, to one of the purest moments of joy ever shown on screen. It's funny, it's charming, it's wacky, and above all, it is dreamily romantic. A true classic, in every sense of the word.",

It is perhaps the smartest slapstick humor piece I've ever seen. The set piece action sequences are funny, smartly done, and unpredictable. There's no talking in the film, but you can pick out almost exactly what the characters are saying. It's brilliantly funny adult humor - sometimes raunchy, sometimes pointing out the charming idiosyncrasies of high society. The characters act smartly and the shot selection is bordering on perfect.

It was a time where films were just now coming out. The silent pictures were just now being made. Charlie Chaplins films were becoming more and more infamous among the pop culture of the early 30s.

Released in 1931, four years after the advent of sound in film, Charlie Chaplin made the bold decision to keep his famous character, the Little Tramp, occupying a world silent but for music. The story of City Lights is far from a complex one; it concerns the Tramp falling in love with a blind flower girl and also befriending a troubled millionaire, with ample amounts of visual and physical comedy thrown into the mix.

300,22 February 2016,daisystar,10, Best Love Story,"The theme of this movie is love - the purest form of human love. Not the contrived romance after a lot of ups and downs,as you typically see in a love story. The movie does have its twists but the key message is loud and clear - when you love another person, you value him/her with care, sympathy and a commitment to helping them thrive at your own expense. It also to some extent defies our 21 century notion of love about finding the perfect match. The encounter between the tramp and the blind girl was simple. They didn't even go on dates.Their mutual affection started with the tramp's sympathy for the girl, and evolved as the tramp started to get more involved in the girl's life. The tramp appeared as a weak little man but being in love made him brave enough to tackle a boxing match.The movie conveys something very pure and clean about love, and makes you ponder that love is most beautiful when it's simple.
