0,18 October 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,10," Forty years on, and it's still outstanding.","Kubrick, King and Nicholson, the writing was literally on the wall, and I don't mean RedRum, forty years on, and The Shining is still a masterpiece.",/
1,23 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, One of my favorite films,"The Shining, you know what's weird about this movie? This is the movie that everyone, for people who claim to not like horror films, will always say that The Shining is a terrific film. This is Stanley Kubrick's classic vision of Stephen King's horror tale of madness and blood. This is just an incredible film and wither you have seen it or not, you have heard of it, know a few lines from it, and know some of the classic images. Who could forget Jack's ""Here's Johnny!""? Who could forget ""All Work and No Play Make Jack a Dull Boy""? Who could forget that chilling ending? This is the film that is unforgettable and honestly in my opinion is Kubrick's best work. I know there is a lot of argument in that department, a lot of people say it's 2001: A Space Odyssey or Clockwork Orange or even Dr. Strangelove, but if those film pioneered film making, then The Shining perfected it. This is the tale of isolation, madness, terrifying images, and the ultimate ghost story that will crawl underneath your skin. ",r
2,20 June 2022,b_kite,10, An absolute classic. Even if it does stray away from the novel.,"While I can understand a lot of Stephen King's arguments over Kubrick's vision, including casting Jack Nicholson who instead of a descent into madness looks insane from the first frame. This is still an absolute classic.",e
3,14 January 2008,neil-476,5, Equivocation,"This is a difficult review to write. You see, I've just posted comments on Ella Enchanted where I comment that, as someone who has never read the book, the film is absolutely fine. But it's difficult for me to approach Stanley Kubrick's The Shining on that basis because, you see, I've read Stephen King's The Shining.",v
4,2 April 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,10, The greatest horror movie of all time.,"Okay, okay, maybe not THE greatest. I mean, The Exorcist and Psycho and a few others are hard to pass up, but The Shining is way up there. It is, however, by far the best Stephen King story that has been made into a movie. It's better than The Stand, better than Pet Sematary (if not quite as scary), better than Cujo, better than The Green Mile, better the Dolores Claiborne, better than Stand By Me (just barely, though), and yes, it's better than The Shawshank Redemption (shut up, it's better), I don't care WHAT the IMDb Top 250 says.  ",i
5,18 May 2021,Fella_shibby,9, The best creepy horror movie involving isolation n eeriness. Also it captured the fear of the unseen in one of the best way.,"I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs, then again in the early 2k on a dvd which I own. Revisited the 144 mins director's cut recently as i am anxious to check out Doctor Sleep n the tv version of The Shining.",e

7,6 January 2021,portraitofaladyonfire,6, I can see why people like it,"My expectation were to high. I expected a masterpiece, but in the end I found it just mediocre. Dont get me wrong the acting and the camera work are great. Storywise I couldnt really get invested in it. In terms of horror except the twins it wasn't scary at all in my opinion.",/
8,31 July 2015,Chiller7,5, Overrated,"Once again, I decided to check out a highly regarded ""cinematic masterpiece"" and was left kinda disappointed. Scariest movie of all time? No, not really. It wasn't even particularly scary.",r
9,28 February 2005,Sfpsycho415,8, One of the scariest movies ever---8/10,"I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted, and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.",w
10,6 June 2022,sydmwswy,9, One of bests,"One of Kubrick's best films. I just think the bathroom sequence should have been taken out of editing. It is insulting....
In this film, I learn that grotesque characters are one of the best ways to summarize an adaptation of a long story. That Kubrick has done well.....",4
11,12 September 2004,Chromium_5,6, A major disappointment.,"This has got to be the most overrated movie in the history of film. I just watched it for the first time, expecting the best of the best, and it was quite a letdown. The sets and music are great, of course, but Kubrick seems to have forgotten one very important thing: to make a horror movie horrifying, you have to have likable characters. That way, when bad things start happening, the audience feels for them.",9
12,24 July 2001,FlickJunkie,9, Amazing achievement in filmmaking and the art of terror.,"Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance's mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.",1
13,19 October 2016,matthewssilverhammer,10," May Not Be Kubrick's Masterpiece, But It's Still a Masterpiece","Kubrick spent his 40+ year career proving that no matter what the genre he will, not only do it well, but will dominate it. The Shining is no exception. A filmed nightmare, it's a naturalistically still and insistently surreal mixture of thick mood and rich story. A maze of surprises even after multiple viewings, its terror hovers right under the surface before exploding onto our brains. A masterpiece of hypnotic horror that's as insidiously, mind-bogglingly creepy as ever. At the center is the ever-menacing presence of Nicholson. Presenting a sobering lesson in how to not be a husband / father (and not just because of the violent climax), his dementia begins unraveling from moment one. Despite his iconically villainous turn, I'm not sure he's even the best of the bunch. Crothers brings beautiful lightness when needed, and his darker moments that much more powerful; and Lloyd walks a brilliant tightrope between creepy-horror-kid, average boyhood, and haunting sadness. Above all, Duvall's compelling and deeply broken turn as forlorn wife / mother is beyond perfect. These performers are given a directorial assuredness to play in rarely matched outside of Kubrick. The plight of these characters is captured with such empathy, we're given a personal view of what could easily have been a cold experience. Every detail is so intentionally and perfectly placed to draw us into the growing madness of the Overlook Hotel: The blood-flood, the dead-eyed stares, the symmetry of the twins, the normally-calm camera ferociously following the swinging axe. Meticulously crafted, intellectually provocative, emotionally penetrating, and dementedly entertaining, though Shining may not be Kubrick's best, it would be most filmmakers magnum opus.",8
14,9 April 2007,yancyscott1,9, timeless terror,"Even though The Shining is over a quarter of a century old, I challenge anyone to not get freaked out by Jack Nicholson's descent into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture. The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense ""writing""... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. The film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. And it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script.",3
15,22 December 2021,charbelelaro,10, This movie has stood the test of time and will forever be praised as one of the greatest achievements in cinema,"The Shining is directed by Stanley Kubrick and is a horror movie based on the novel by Steven King. In reviewing this film, there's probably nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece. This movie has stood the test of time and will forever be praised as one of the greatest achievements in cinema. From the production design, to the performances, the movie is unmatched. The atmosphere Kubrick creates in The Shining is in my opinion, the reason why this movie has suck around as long as it has. The Overlook Hotel is a character in itself. The way the music in the opening credits establishes the feeling of this setting whilst the camera travels through nature leading to to hotel, just instantly impacts the audience, immediately immersing them into the world. Once you enter the hotel, you feel as though you are really there living through the characters. Jack Nicholson's performance as Jack Torrance is beyond perfect. He presents the slow progression of insanity so authentically, which ultimately leads to one of the most iconic climaxes of all time. His wife played my Shelley Duvall does an amazing job with a performance so over the top is actually works. The son, Danny Torrance is probably my favourite character in the movie. He easily could have ruined the film but he does a fantastic job in delivering some absurd lines which I still genuinely get so creeped out by. The Shining is a film lovers dream. And whilst Steven king didn't like the film, how can one not marvel at all the symmetry, vibrant colour palette and perfect set design. Seriously I know the Overlook Hotel is haunted, but I would check into that place any day. To walk through the ballroom, see the iconic carpet and use that unusually modern red bathroom would be a dream. The Shining is one of my favourites movies ever. And whilst this review probably doesn't mean anything because this film has already seen enough praise, I'm still going to give it a 10/10. If you haven't seen The Shining get off your phone and go watch it right now. Seriously it's a classic how haven't you watched it yet?",3
16,15 January 2023,kevin_robbins,10, A true masterpiece and must see,The Shining (1980) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a writer who agrees to overlook a hotel in Colorado during the winter months when it's closed down. His son has an imaginary friend that helps him see things. When the family arrives at the hotel he tries to warn the family something is off but they feel it's just him adjusting. The hotel brings lies and secrets about the family to the surface. When a snowstorm hits the hotel that won't let anyone in or out the families hope for surviving the winter diminishes.,7

18,3 May 2019,Oeuvre_Klika,4, What a disappointment,I had heard so much about how brilliant this movie was. I finally watched it and I hated it.,?
19,11 May 2010,ScottAmundsen,1, The Funniest Comedy of 1980,"I shall never, ever be able to understand the phenomenon known as Stanley Kubrick. When he was on, as with DR STRANGELOVE, he was brilliant. But when he was bad, he was awful.",r
20,21 September 2013,cineastFGD,1, Probably the most overrated movie of all times,"This is probably the most overrated movie of all times. I'm not a huge horror fan and I get scared very easily, but this movie actually made me laugh or sigh in despair about the lengthiness of the scenes and the predictability of the plot. I read the novel when I was a teen and it beat the crap out of me, I still am afraid of bath tubs in hotel rooms (embarrassing but true). The novel is an all time favourite of me and when I read all the great reviews about Kubick's Shining I was really looking forward to see the movie. What a mistake. For all lovers of the book, this is not a book adaptation, Kubick made his own story...unfortunately. Not only does Dick Hallorann get murdered by Jack - the fact he survives in the novel was one of the reasons I loved the book so much, it has after all somewhat of a happy ending -, but even worse, Kubick turned the whole story around and twisted it to an extend where the original plot is hard to recognize. Jack Torrance is very obviously a mad man right from the beginning who very openly hates his wife and kid, so as others have pointed out before, why didn't he leave his family or killed them before. The whole point of the novel, the normal guy and loving father with a hang to alcohol who gradually gets brainwashed by appearances in the hotel, gets totally lost. One might wonder why the movie even needs the whole hotel plot if Torrance is already mad as a hatter from the very beginning. Apart from this, I guess, had I not read the novel I would probably not understand one bit of what was going on with the characters. But unfortunately that's not all. Also the performances of Nicholson and Duvall were so lousy, it really crept me out. I've never seen Jack Nicholson perform so badly, he seemed like a parody of himself and don't get me started on Shelley Duvall. Periodically I thought I watched some amateur actor in a school play. Her adaptation of Wendy Torrance was so annoying I was staggered between the wish of seeing her chopped to pieces and the wish to see her survive and protect her little boy. The character Wendy in the novel is a strong, resourceful person, the Wendy in the movie is a whiny, weak, and extremely stupid person. The fact that she lays down and sleeps while she is trapped with her 'sick' son and a mad man in a hotel with no contact to the outside world is beneath me. The ending is probably the worst part of the entire movie, on the one hand it's ecstasy as the film draws to an end on the other hand it is as far from the original plot as can be which in this case is an extremely bad thing. The only actor that impressed me was Danny Lloyd, apart from the fact that Kubick partly tried to turn him into a parody of Regan MacNeil I think he did a fantastic job for the little six year old boy he was to that time. He seemed like the only natural actor on the scene. ",e
21,28 December 2021,akdjreview,9, Not so scary incredible film,"Horror films are not my cup of tea. But The Shining has gotten me to reconsider this preference. With an incredible performance by Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, I might even say it is one of the best I've ever seen. Meanwhile, considering this movie is a horror film, it always keeps you on your toes. While also being a compact story and with few actors making the film more intriguing and heart wrenching.",f
22,23 November 2019,kosmasp,10, King Shining,"I have not yet watched the TV version of the Shining. You know the one Stephen King actually likes and prefers to Kubricks version of his novel.

23,16 September 2017,benjaminburt,9," I hate horror, but I love this movie!","The Shining is a masterclass in film-making and a staple of popular culture. I, personally, cannot stand horror films. I don't like to feel scared, and I don't like to have my emotions manipulated by scary monsters, scary music, scary lighting, etc. I feel like horror is an easy genre - it's easy to scare some people, and people go to movies hoping to feel something, so why not fear?",=
24,17 October 2011,planktonrules,9," Considering there are already a bazillion reviews of this film on IMDb, why not add one more?!","This film is currently the 48th highest rated movie on IMDb and there are something like a bazillion reviews for it already on this site, so it's not like my review is going to matter very much. Still, I decided to finally see this film for the first time and thought I'd toss my impressions into the HUGE pool of information.",t
25,6 February 2015,Leofwine_draca,10," Better than the novel, by far","Probably the most popular and easily accessible Kubrick film in existence, THE SHINING is a film I've seen plenty of times over the years and yet it's a movie that never gets old. Part of the reason for that is the professionalism of the director; his cinematography is exceptional, really bringing the Overlook Hotel to life so that it becomes a character in itself.",t
26,1 June 2007,Howlin Wolf,10," Whether you want black comedy or horror, Kubrick delivers it all with this one.","... This isn't the first time Stanley blurred the distinction between genres to such great effect, either. In Dr. Strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation, and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments. Slow-burning madness and attempting to kill one's family isn't hilarious of course, but the dialogue is very knowing (""five months of peace is just what I want... "") and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be riotous if you included just one type of spirit, but is spine-chilling when you factor in the other.",_
27,9 January 2009,manchester_england2004,1, A real chore to sit through!,"I never did understand the appeal of this terrible movie. Mind you, I could probably say the same about most movies directed by Stanley Kubrick. He is one of those directors who produces very long, boring movies that move at a snail's pace and are really difficult to withstand for more than a few minutes at a time. Movies such as 2001: A SPACE ODYESSY, DR. STRANGELOVE and SPARTACUS are examples of this kind of movie.",u
28,18 June 2019,UniqueParticle,10, Eerie Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King masterpiece!,"Spiraling madness done best in the most convoluted way! Among Jack Nicholson's best performances, so meticulous and sticks with you like molasses in the brain. The long shots are true art in film and Jack losing his mind is one of my favorite things ever! It shakes you to your core every time, I have seen it at least 6 times; it's always shocking. You can't ask for a better experience, I'm glad bits of The Shining were in Ready Player One and it's getting sort of a sequel!",r
29,2 April 2021,minastrate,6, Hugely overrated.,"It's just okay. Like, nice to watch but, kinda' boring until the last third of the film; by which point it becomes pretty epic!

But, hey, that's just my two cents.",v
30,12 August 2002,smashattack,1, Number one on my most awful list!,"All right, I've already written one review for this movie.  But I've gotten lots of hate mail since then because I was told I did not explain enough. So here goes.",
31,17 September 2004,preppy-3,1, It's a horror of a film!,Lousy adaptation of Stephen King's great novel. It's about a family watching over a huge hotel (the Overlook) which is located in the mountains in Colorado during the winter. They're basically isolated out there--miles and miles away from anyone. Also seems the hotel is haunted and starts to take possession of the father (Jack Nicholson). Then the snowstorms hit--they're completely snowed in and the mother (Shelley Duvall) and little son (Danny Lloyd) are at the mercy of the axe-wielding father...,
32,10 March 2012,classicsoncall,9," ""Five months of peace is just what I want.""","Back in the Seventies when Stephen King's horror novels were coming out, I would challenge myself to read them in the dead of night with the rest of the lights in the house off and no one else around. Most of the time I could force myself through a couple of chapters, but every once in a while King's narrative would stimulate the imagination so wildly I'd have to put the book down. Like the Sandy Koufax card in 'Needful Things', or the clown in the storm drain in 'It'. With 'The Shining', it was the idea of those dead twin girls inviting little Danny to come and play.",
33,27 February 2019,loricossette-20061,7," I love Kubrick, but puzzled by this film's high rating","I think the title of my review says it all. Kubrick was genius. Full stop. I love Strangelove, it is timeless and brilliant. I love Jack Nicholson, I could watch him sleep and be entertained. Scatman Crothers, also adore. But not this film. I honestly do not understand the high rating. Jack is Jack, and that is great, but from the moment he appeared, there was no descent into madness as per the novel. It was a hysterical performance, literally. His smart ass smile that I love, the eyebrows, glint in his eye, sarcasm, was excellent, but totally not scary. And that is the problem. I know I will get reamed, but this film failed to capture the isolation and suffication of the novel. It is like a collection of scenes. Elevator door opens, oh lookblood. Why??? Why??? Too jarring. Various characters in costumes, never explained. You really have to read the novel to understand the scenes. A caveat: I think the hedge maze was a genius choice and better than the topiary animals in the novel. But why switch from a mallet to an axe? The bartender Lloyd was very creepy. The most incredible and scary part of the film is when Duvall frantically keeps flipping through the typed pages that all say the same thing. THAT was amazing. To be honest, I laughed most of the time Jack was spewing his lines. Well made, but overrated.",
34,4 November 2005,Theo Robertson,7, Terrifying In Places But Ultimately Confusing,With THE SHINING Stanley Kubrick grabs the audience with the very first shot of the opening title sequence: A zoom shot over a lake as bombastic and very disconcerting music is played and as the music continues eldritch cries of children can be heard in the background,
35,21 December 2007,onepotato2,1," Book, schnook","Many King fans hate this because it departed from the book, but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump. That notwithstanding, the movie does fail completely, but it fails entirely on film terms. I'd like to smack the people who tell me it's the scariest movie ever made. I always follow up with the question ""Really... exactly what scene scared you?"" Every fan I've asked, goes silent. Occasionally someone, at a loss for a decent scare (There are none...), names the ""Grape-juice-shooting-out-of-elevators"" shtick. If you're afraid of that, I don't know what to tell you, except maybe that you're easily scared. I just rolled my eyes watching these z-grade horror ideas play out in this schlocky, incoherent movie.",
36,21 April 2023,alienlegend,10, One of the best horror films ever made.,"Jack Nicholson and Stanley Kubrick are an unbeatable combination. The stories behind the making of this are legendary like Kubrick often doing over 100 takes but I think the final result speaks for itself. Sure, maybe Stephen King has a point: Jack is rather crazy from the start but you can't take your eyes off him. He is such a powerful force in this film and I can't imagine it without him. Of course, the cinematography and Kubrick's direction are the other huge elements like the famous Steadicam shot following Danny but really everything works flawlessly in this. Yes, there is a helicopter shadow in the famous beginning credit scroll but so what, nothing is perfect yet I'd still round this up to perfection just for the atmosphere alone.",
37,7 October 2002,Aaron1375,6, Good...but not as good as some say.,"I liked this movie, but how it is ranked so high is beyond me.  There are some pretty scary images in the movie, but on the whole it is not that scary.  In fact, for the most part it is just watching people putter around a hotel by themselves and one of them goes insane.  The boys powers are for the most part ignored, and it is a major part of the book.  Though I myself would have loved to have driven around on a big wheel through a hotel at that age it doesn't really belong in this movie either, what the kid can't be walking and discover stuff?  Jack though does a great job as the father, though he seems a bit to insane at the beginning so him going crazy is definately not a surprise.  All in all a few scary scenes here and there, but this one to me is just an ok movie, not the scariest movie by any stretch of the imagination.",
38,1 December 2000,krumski,7, All play and no work makes Jack (Nicholson) a VERY dull boy. . .,"It's certainly not a new complaint in relation to this film, but I must register it anyway: Jack Nicholson's acting here is all wrong for the material. Instead of a slow buildup from banality to insanity - which, given the movie's otherwise brilliant creepiness of tone and style - could have been truly horrific to watch, we get Jack Torrance as the nutjob Big Bad Wolf right from the very beginning. It's weird: it's as if Kubrick is indeed making the ultimate horror film, and Nicholson is sabotaging it every step of the way by enacting the ultimate horror film *parody*. Each on its own terms is immensely enjoyable, but they effectively cancel each other out. I've never seen the styles of director and star diverge so emphatically (A minor comparison would be the first ""Fletch"" movie, where Michael Ritchie's taut direction is appropriate to a gritty crime thriller, but where star Chevy Chase waltzes through the vehicle glibly throwing darts into every dramatic setup).",

42,13 December 2016,Bored_Dragon,10, Kubrick's top three,"I never paid too much attention to directors and in the most of the movies I saw I was unable to recognize them. Besides Lynch and Jarmusch, Kubrick is one of the few that I could never mistake for someone else. All of his movies, however different their stories might be, share that insane atmosphere that simply screams Kubrick. Frames, angles, sound and his particular kind of creepy unmistakably betray him. While watching any of his movies I have flashes from his other movies. Although their plots are not related, this movie reminds me of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and bit of ""Clockwork Orange"", and with those two makes the holy trinity of Stanley Kubrick's heritage. In my opinion, one of the best movies of all time.",
43,16 May 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9," A chilling Stephen King adaptation, with Kubrick trying to be different","Very loosely based on the book, which is very chilling and shocking, this is a great film. Having seen The Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me and It and liking all three of them, I knew I should check out the Shining. I did feel that Jack Torrence's hallucinations, apparitions and time-warps were introduced a little too quickly and the build up to the ending was rushed too. But it is very stylishly filmed, making perfect use of an amazing set built at Elstree and a gliding Steadicam, and the music is atmospheric. The story is also effective, and there are really nice touches in the script. Kubrick here tries to be different, and I think he does a superb job at it. The Shining is more chilling rather than shocking, the blood flowing from the doors and the old woman in the bathtub made my hairs stand up on the back of my neck, and is constantly discomforting in an eerie sort of way. Jack Nicolson gives a barnstorming performance as Jack, a performance that is both hammy and disturbing, and Shelley Duvall does decently in a somewhat thankless role. Young Danny Lloyd is superb as Danny, his chanting of Redrum especially became increasingly hypnotic and distorted. The film concludes with a fairly suspenseful ending, and is overall a film with one or two problems and a very loose adaptation but it is a chilling adaptation with Kubrick succeeding at being different. 9/10 Bethany Cox",
44,25 November 2006,kenjha,5, Kubrick's Worst,"It is hard to believe that the man who made ""Paths of Glory"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"" could have created this nonsense. It starts off with a fairly interesting premise but soon turns south, thanks to a story that is silly and characters that are one-dimensional and under-developed. Nicholson's acting is way over the top with the only redeeming quality being that it's pretty funny at times. Duvall is at her bug-eyed, buck-toothed worst as Nicholson's simpering ninny of a wife. The blame for this must fall on Kubrick, as both actors have shown that they are capable of better performances. While visually opulent, the film is totally lacking in subtlety, a huge disappointment from a master filmmaker.",

46,19 April 2006,Hitchcoc,9, Very Good; But Could Have Been Great,"I always try hard not to compare media. Unfortunately, I had read the King novel just before seeing the movie. There are plot elements that could have been included that would have made this a much better movie. One of the things is ""the shining"" itself, the supernatural abilities of the young boy. The character of Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers) is used up with virtually no effect on the plot. I don't know why King allowed that to happen, because it weakens so badly the chance of the victims to escape. The topiary could have been used to a better advantage as well. The way things are, it is too one sided. That being said, I think the Nicholson role is awesome. This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It has enough shadows and manipulation of the supernatural to really be frightening. I loved when Jack was telling the man who hires him what a great opportunity this was for him to work. He's about as wolfy and sly as he can be. Of course, when he finally gets there, the hotel takes over and he begins to become that wolf. One of the most terrifying moments in all of film is when Shelly Duvall , the wife, picks up all the pages he has typed and they are just gibberish. Kubrick plays with us in grand style. I saw the movie a few years after my first viewing, and because the book was behind me, I enjoyed it a great deal more, even though I knew the events unfolding.

As I read, he had gotten Shelley Duvall act the same scene 87 times, then Duvall had a nervous breakdown. It seems impossible, but unfortunately, in spite of this effort (perfectionism) there is nothing except for Jack Nicholson. Everyone talks about the bicycle scene with amazement. Yes, it was interesting, but if we think about Kubrick's other movies, it is nothing. The script is seriously mediocre, the direction is a bit better than the script. For example, the development of the story is uninspiring. Nicholson enters the bar of the house and starts to talk to a man, but also he does not react at all as if everything is fine. What a bad idea to mention that the house is uncanny. You think to yourself like what is going on here? The idea of the man who comes a mansion with his wife and children, then he starts to go mad was not well adapted in other words. The movie is in contradiction with Kubrick's coherent direction style. The final was one of the most uninspiring finals of all times and a little bit ridiculous. The characters who sense the danger and try to help are nonsense and unnecessary. Those characters only serve to thrill us, but unnecessary. The child often looks gawkily, he gapes. Those moments are very silly and to me really annoying. The hatchet scene is the best (the only best) scene of the movie. I should count the bicycle scene, too which the child rides his bike through the corridors. Generally, in fact, always, nobody does something to the bad movies which loved and overrated, but The Shining was nominated for the worst director in Razzie awards.

Stanley Kubrick's flawless technical direction calls attention to itself by its slow pacing which results in a Distancing Effect which does not serve the horror genre well; the viewer needs to be totally immersed. The psychological tension is slowly brought to a tautness, but Jack Nicholson's manic and jumpy side is revealed too early for any mystery to take hold.

62,5 May 2004,Coventry,4, Good film! Butis it really worth the status of `Horror Classic'??,"Stanley Kubrick's the Shining is a powerful cinema experience and a fine adaptation of Stephen King's novel, but I think the high status it enjoys is rather questionable. Too easily this film is labeled as the `scariest' horror film ever and many of the sequences are a bit overblown, if you ask me. Recently some website published the hundred scariest movie moments and multiple parts of the Shining positioned high in this list. True, legendary sequences like Jack Nicholson screaming `Heeeeeeeeere's Johnny!' and the little boy approaching room 237 on his tricycle look impressive when seen separate, but when you watch this film as a wholesome (like the way it was intended, naturally) it loses some of its power. I think Stanley Kubrick himself is to blame for this. Often during the Shining, he undercuts the tension himself by showing repetitive images and underdeveloped ideas. The cause of Jack Torrance's madness isn't explained like it should be and comes a bit sudden (in case you're not familiar with the plot: Jack Nicholson's character suffers from a writer's block and accepted a job as caretaker in a famous Colorado hotel, during the dead-of-winter. Along with his wife and son, he spends the winter up there while the isolation and impact of previous drama's that took place there slowly cause Jack to go insane and threat his family with an axe). Not a bad word about Stanley Kubrick and his (almost) flawless career, but I feel he's to blame for the partially missed opportunity that is The Shining. All the other necessary elements to create a horror milestone are there. The setting is uniquely isolated and perfect for the story. The cinematography (by John Alcott, who previously worked with Kubrick for Barry Lyndon and A clockwork Orange) simply is outstanding and the acting is GREAT! That surely has to be said: Jack Nicholson gives one of his most amazing performances of his already brilliant career. Really, Jack's facial expressions often make you wonder whether he isn't the reincarnation of the devil himself! Especially in The Shining, he's the kind of guy you don't want to mess with! Good film and certainly recommended butthink twice before ranking it as `essential'",

I hate to point this out to Mr. King, but his novel was a rather simplistic horror yarn - a classic of its genre?

He is excellent as a man who enters a hotel, and rapidly starts to lose his mind. Shelley Duvall is good as Mrs. Torrance. However, I've never understood the stupid way she dressed here. Danny Lloyd was effective as the son, especially when he says ""Redrum"" about fifty times. Perhaps intentionally, the movie never makes it clear as to exactly what ""happens"" within the hotel. The hotel seems to be possessed by ""dead spirits"" that gradually take control of the occupants. My favorite scene is when Nicholson kisses the naked lady in room 237. I love when he realizes that she is really a deformed corpse, and she starts laughing like a maniac. Another great scene is the one referred to in my heading.

⚪
All in all, Stanley Kubrick's take on Stephen King's virtuoso novel might stray extremely far from what the famous author has had envisioned in the first place, but other than it, it chases the viewer through a masterfully constructed maze of psychological terror, unadulterated insanity, oppressive feelings of claustrophobia and horrifying imagery that, thanks to an ingenious direction, outstanding camera work, an infernal musical score and a tour de force performance by Jack Nicholson, becomes an indescribably atmospheric, extremely packing and tremendously nerve-racking, snowbound spectacle that manages to be a brilliant film despite being one of the worst adaptations to exist.
⚪
By now it has been more than four years since I have read what I consider one of my favourites by horror author Stephen King, and still it has such a tremendous impact on me. Like it was yesterday, I remember how enamoured I was by this book, and this fascination doesn't occur with every book I take in my hands. I think what made the experience even more intense was that I read it after I have moved and we had no internet for almost a month, and since I am a slave to modern technology, that was a heavy issue for me back in the day. The only thing I was able to do besides unpacking my stuff and trying to maintain my sanity was reading this novel. As I said, Stephen King is a true icon of horror literature, and this book is only one of many proofs. Like I do it with every book I read, I also checked out this adaptation by the legendary film maker Stanley Kubrick after I have finished it. Well, what am I to say except for that I was both tremendously disappointed and extremely enthusiastic at the same time? What sounds like paradoxical nonsense is indeed a justified reception, since Kubrick only used the basic outline of King's source material and realised his own version of ""The Shining"" - and in itself it is still a brilliant horror film. It is a rare case where I love both the book and the respective movie adaptation for being completely different. Crazy, isn't it? Even if I have seen it often since then, this watch was indeed a novelty, since it was the first time I was able to watch the US version that famously runs half an hour longer than the European Cut that is generally distributed here. Me and my brother (who recently finished re-reading the book and pitched the idea to watch it this weekend) agreed that the longer version is in no case superior to the EU version. Quite the contrary, most of the scenes were indeed pleasant but unnecessary for the further development of the film. So, regardless of which version, it is still one of the most influential and magnificently crafted horror films of the twentieth century. Kubrick knows to translate the feeling of isolation, paranoia and madness into action, and seriously, he has the best lead actor for this job. Jack Nicholson was downright born for this role. From the very beginning during the interview to the iconic maze chase scene in the end, he conveys this threatening feeling of unpredictability perfectly. He is an out and out menace in this film and delivers what I consider to be in the top three of his performances, however, I think that the other actors involved deserves big respect as well. Shelley Duvall (who was notoriously harassed by the eccentric director on set) plays the role of Wendy Torrance with such a genuine intensity. No surprise, since she was a nervous wreck in real life during shooting. I would have given her an Oscar nomination, instead they nominated her for the Razzie Award as Worst Actress (a decision I am still unable to comprehend, like what?). Oh, and even Danny Lloyd, the child actor portraying the Torrance offspring, delivers surprisingly decently for a boy of his age. Aside from that, it displays the usual eccentric virtuosity the director is known for. Insightful camera angles (mostly thanks to the newly used Steadicam), chilling cinematography and horrifying imagery being the key factors to why this film works out so well, and it is even more superb how Kubrick managed to find the perfect balance between graphic and gritty horror and suggestive psychological terror. Even if he could have focussed more on the fact that the hotel itself is actually the hostile entity that tries to kill everyone and only uses the mad maintenance man Jack as tool for their business, it is still absolutely terrifying. Nicholson, as stated earlier, is a true force of nature, and the wonderful scene where he breaks through the door with an axe is iconic for a reason. Is there anything to criticize, then? Well, although it captured the gradual mental deterioration and increasing sense of claustrophobia flawlessly, there is still some pacing issues that, especially in the longer cut, show to advantage. Many scenes are unnecessarily long and more stretched than it would have been required, and that is also a reason I cannot bestow it a perfect rating. However, regardless of all this, I still think that this movie is one of the director's finest features, and a film I can revisit all the time.

86,14 August 2014,ironhorse_iv,9," The Shining indeed shines. One of the most iconic horror film, ever.","This is the thinking man's horror movie. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the movie is loosely based off the novel by Stephen King with the same name. Kubrick takes the concept of King's novel, and makes it, his own. The movie is about Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) a writer with writer's block who takes up a job as caretaker for an isolated, snow-bound hotel over the winter. He brings his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and young child, Danny (Danny Lloyd) with him, where he intends to get some good work done. The Hotel has an ominous murderous past, where previous caretakers and patrons had killed themselves or others. The madness of being isolate in the hotel takes its toll on the family, as the past start to haunt them, forcing one of them to snap. This is one of those confusing films with so many interpretations of what the movie meant. It's no surprised, that fans would love to explore more on its themes and subliminal messages. Some people even watch the film, backwards and forwards at the same time. There are hundreds of interpretations ranging from CIA, The Illuminati, the Gold Standard and others. The most popular ones are that the movie was about the massacre of the American Indians because the film is loaded with Native American symbolism from the hotel's theme, location, and it's never ending supply of Calumet. According to this theory, the infamous visions of gushing red liquid streaming from the elevators actually make sense, as it represents the souls buried deep beneath the hotel, with the elevator cabin dropping down into the basement like in a well, delivering a bucket blood upon its return to the surface. Others believe it's about the holocaust, due to the number 42 being throughout the film. Half-hidden numerology is meant to evoke the year 1942, the same year the Nazis launched the Final Solution. I found it to be a little bit stretch. It could be that the director was fan of Jackie Robinson or really love the romantic movie 'Summer of 1942'. Still, Kubrick loves dipping his hand into Nazism symbolism. Then there are those, who think Kubrick made this movie to come clean about helping the government fake the moon landing because a character wore an Apollo 11 sweater and how the room 237, represent the number of distance from the earth to the moon. Most of this theory come from a 2002's French mockumentary film, call Dark Side of the Moon that was made as a spoof. There is no prove that Kubrick had anything to do with Apollo 11. I do believe that Kubrick's does tackle the themes of coincidences of life, dreams, racism, repressed sexual themes, and the past does not exist in this film. I do believe he use Theseus and the Minotaur as plot references. The huge giant maze was indeed added for the film, only. I dig the part of the Red VW Beetle being smashed up as a jab at Stephen King's source material as an inside joke as if saying, it's my movie, now. The other theories of the film are less lunatic, but drawn from small details like chair disappearing, TV had no cord, the window being in an odd place, typewriter changing colors, the carpet changing patterns, Etc. Etc. The people in the film, think Stanley Kubrick can't make mistakes. I for one, don't think Kubrick is a perfect with full control of every tiny little thing on his sets. Most of these examples seem more errors, then metaphors. The way, its shot is great for the most part. I love the opening helicopter shot of the lake. Wonderfully shot, lots of long, smooth tracking shots and perfectly placed imagery and slow dissolves. One of the famous sequences in which the camera tracks Danny. That was pretty cool to watch. Really great striking imagery, like the blood-red and white bathroom. The use of color is one of the highlights. The title screens & accompanying screeching orchestra is amazing use of a countdown. The score is fittingly atmospheric and unique. The drum winding up and down is particularly great. The movie does have some different in International cinema releases and new releases. Stanley Kubrick shot Jack's typewriter pages in different languages for release in different countries. Also, some versions add the delete scenes to it. It makes for a lot of re-watch value. Although it made for a better, tighter film, if it wasn't there. It's interesting to see the film spell things out, but these scenes ultimately hurt the pacing, so it was right to cut. Still, there were some awful WTF frankly hilarious shot with skeletons with Shelley and the man in the bear suit that could had been chop. The acting was alright for the most part. Jack Nicholson is captivating and terrifying. He gives a believable performance. Still, his acting isn't much of a stretch, as Jack, the actor been known as a crazy guy, before this movie. Shelley Duvall is mediocre at best. Wendy, the clueless housewife, is barely tolerable before things go down. When they do, she's just there to be the final girl. I'm sure it was emotionally & physically draining for the actress, but nobody liked her on set! It's seem like Stanley and her, bump heads a lot in this film, and you really do see, how much Stanley didn't like, working with her. The writing is pretty good. I love how dialogue changes tone, topic, seriousness and deadly intent line by line. Still, I wish there were more things from the book, add to this film. I like the power of the Shining, be used more in the film. The book makes the father, more of a tragic figure, than the straight out jerk in this film. Overall: Here's Johnny and he's absolutely incredible to watch.",

92,27 March 2009,rneil95,10, Horrid Movie,"Stephen King is one of the greatest American novelists in the past century. While he is dubbed a ""horror writer,"" he is much more than that. He is a character writer, and while his novels are intended to scare, characters are the central point of the novels. They rely so heavily on backstory that the characters are practically real. However, this is very hard to do on film and it can result in making the story seem unimportant. So, as you can expect, I was not eager to see how they could ruin The Shining. Well, after reading the spectacular novel, I moved onto the film. After watching the film, I was flaming mad. The film The Shining does not fail from their overuse of backstory. These characters are completely shallow and you don't care about them. King novels are hard to adapt, but they can be done well. Carrie is an example of that. However, this movie is an awful adaptation. Kubrick basically took some character names, some locations, and made his own ""scary hotel"" movie. Why he couldn't just make his own ""scary hotel"" movie, I don't know. The acting is, for the most part, garbage. Shelley Duvall gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen. She's just so awful that you want her to get killed, as opposed to the novel. I just felt that I didn't care about anybody in this film. It felt empty and like there was no point to anything in the end. King said that he doesn't like the film because it doesn't make you feel. I agree completely with that. I felt nothing other than lack of interest when I watched this stinker. It wasn't even passable as a good stand-alone film. I hated every minute of this film. It was supposedly psychological horror, but it didn't make me think at all. This movie is horrible, and I hope book readers never have to witness an adaptation as bad as this atrocity...well, okay, there is the '97 TV movie, but even that's not as bad as this crap!",

95,31 October 2022,nickenchuggets,9, Hey Mister Jack,"Like most other movies Stanley Kubrick has made (even the average ones), The Shining is usually considered a classic nowadays. After first seeing it years ago, I remember being very enthused with it, but upon closer examination, I don't think it holds up as well. While personally, I think it's a bit too long and the first hour or so isn't that unsettling, it really starts to get good once the horrendous snowstorm prevents the main characters from going anywhere and getting help. Based on a book by Stephen King, the plot follows Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a guy who brings his family with him to a large and opulent hotel in the Colorado mountains during the winter so that he can be the proprietor there all season long. The hotel closes each winter, so Jack, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny will be the sole occupants. Before assuming his new position, Jack attends a meeting with manager Mr. Ullman who tells him a brutal murder was committed there about a decade prior, in which a man slaughtered his wife and two daughters with an axe and dismembered their bodies. Shortly after, Danny (Daniel Lloyd) talks to a psychiatrist about how he has an imaginary friend named Tony who sometimes takes the place of his own voice. Danny says Tony can't be seen by anyone because he hides in his mouth. Danny and his parents then take a tour of Overlook Hotel in order to get a feel for it, and while there, he meets the head chef, Mr. Hallorann (Scatman Crothers). Hallorann later talks to Danny alone and says both of them share some kind of psychic ability which allows them to communicate without actually talking. Hallorann knows this because he unknowingly called Danny ""Doc"" earlier that day, not knowing his own parents often call him that. As Danny rides his tricycle around the hallways of the hotel, he encounters a distressing hallucination in which he sees the two girls who were murdered 10 years earlier beckoning him to play with them. Concurrently, Jack appears to show the early onset of a mental breakdown, as he curses at Wendy when she interrupts him during his time spent on a typewriter. He also has a nightmare of doing the same grisly acts to his wife and child as the killer did. Danny later comes across room 237, which Hallorann told him to stay far away from, probably because it belonged to the killer. Meanwhile, Jack visits a large ballroom in the hotel, staffed by a single bartender named Lloyd. Although he's just an illusion Jack is somehow able to talk with him and indulge in his drinks (which he's not supposed to do). Wendy runs in crying and says some disturbed woman tried to strangle Danny in room 237. Jack visits the room (which is mysteriously open and has its lights on), and experiences a vision where a nude woman rises from a bathtub and embraces him. Upon seeing her in the mirror, she changes into the decomposing corpse of the murderer's wife. A traumatized Jack bolts out of the room and back to Wendy, but he tells her he found nothing. Wendy is also angry at Jack because Danny has red marks on his neck and she thinks he's responsible. Jack returns to the ballroom, now attended by hundreds of people, and meets someone in the bathroom named Delbert Grady (Philip Stone), who Jack recognizes as the murderer. Grady warns Jack that Danny is trying to use his telepathic ability to contact Mr. Hallorann so that he can be rescued, and that it's Jack's job to make sure this can't happen. By now, a massive blizzard is raging outside and anyone getting near the hotel is next to impossible. While Jack is away from his study, Wendy finds pieces of paper that detail what's he's been working so hard to write all this time, but she only finds the phrase ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" written thousands of times on numerous pages. Jack confronts and yells at her about how she has no respect for his responsibilities, and Wendy swings at him with a bat as he tries to follow her up some stairs. While he's knocked out, Wendy drags Jack to a kitchen pantry and locks him in. She tries to reason with him and says she's taking Danny to a doctor, but Jack says she's not going anywhere anytime soon, as he's sabotaged their only radio and snowcat. Jack is later freed by Mr. Grady's ghost, and Danny starts behaving like he's possessed. He almost stabs his mother at one point, but Jack shows up and Wendy is forced to lock herself and Danny in the bathroom. Unable to get the half frozen window open fully, Wendy allows Danny to escape, but she's left behind as Jack menacingly busts down part of the door with an axe. Right as he's about to kill his wife, Jack hears Hallorann's snowcat approaching outside. Hallorann enters the hotel, checking to see where Jack can be, when he's suddenly struck in the chest by his axe from around a pillar. After Jack murders Hallorann, Wendy runs all over the hotel looking for her son, the building now swarming with the visions of ghosts, skeletons, and deluges of blood. Danny runs out of the hotel and into a nearby hedge maze, with Jack following close behind. Danny backtracks in the maze, confusing his father about his whereabouts, and then reunites with his mother. He and Wendy drive off in Hallorann's snowcat while Jack freezes to death. After Jack dies, a picture of a ballroom party in the hotel's lobby dated 1921 has his face front and center in a crowd. My god, this movie is really complicated. Because it's so long, it has quite a long list of plot points and other things to keep in mind while you're watching, which is odd because the movie mostly takes place in just one location. While King himself tried to distance himself from this film because it deviates quite a bit from his book, I would still say The Shining is real creepy even over 40 years later. The music and sound effects are a big part of that, since we sometimes get long scenes where there's no music, but instead what sounds like a heartbeat in the background. A good example would be when Jack checks up on room 237, the room itself looking unsettling because it looks deceptively tidy and neat for the former residence of a killer. It reminds me of many haunted places I've seen that look no different from ordinary houses. As for the settings, the hotel is a beautiful building inside and out. Being made in the early 1900s, it has an archaic feel to it, and it really does feel like you're back in the 20s when Jack visits the ballroom for the second time. Speaking of whom, I felt that Nicholson gave arguably the best performance of his long career in this movie (aside from OFOTCN). Jack has never really been known for being a stable, moderate person even in real life, and that's shown to great effect here. He's easily irritated, violent, and completely unsociable. The scene where he breaks the door down is still one of cinema's masterpieces. So is the part where he berates Wendy about his work. Like many good horror movies, The Shining makes you feel alone while watching it, which helps amplify the horror, and the setting does much to sell that. It's bad enough that Wendy and Danny are forced to stay with him alone all winter, but once the blizzard comes, they have nowhere else to go. One thing that always bothered me about this movie though is how Shelley Duvall was actually nominated for a worst actress award. I find this totally ridiculous. I don't know how anyone can see her performance as not good enough. Putting that aside, I still think The Shining deserves to be called one of horror's finest, which is exactly why it's still discussed in great detail so much.",
96,16 November 2007,moonspinner55,6," With benefit of hindsight and a clear perspective, the film is obviously a disappointment...","Stanley Kubrick takes an arguably weak Stephen King literary tomb and possibly reads more into the material than what King had originally cooked up. Jack Nicholson interviews to be the winter caretaker of a mammoth, isolated Colorado hotel and immediately feels at home in the lonely vastness of its eerie expanse; his jittery wife and muted, psychic young son aren't so sure about the surroundings, especially after Dad starts exhibiting uncontrolled behavior. Once again, Kubrick displays his fabulous grasp of film-technique, resulting in some sensational scenes (particularly the opening drive up the mountain, the child's first meeting with the psychic cook, the overhead shot of the maze, and a funny/scary bit with Shelley Duvall fending off crazy Jack with a baseball bat). Unfortunately, the plot is all gummed up; it takes in past and present incidents, characters as mind demons, and a boy's fear of his father and fails to make all the elements cohere. Worse, the pieces don't make this much of a scary puzzle--it's too confounding to be truly terrifying--and the finale (filled with lots of freaky goings-on) releases all the tension Kubrick has worked so hard to build up. Some may see the confusing debauchery and the blood-filled elevator as Kubrick's comment on the horror genre, his imperviousness to the usual scare-movie tactics--he's above clichés--though what he DOES give us doesn't add up. A great deal of screen-time is spent getting help to the woman and her son (in the form of the cook) and also in locking up Nicholson when he becomes too violent--and both chapters end ridiculously. Was Kubrick gleeful at cutting such corners? If so, he shouldn't have been. ""The Shining"" feels like a cheat in so many ways that frustration ultimately mitigates the suspense. **1/2 from ****",

Sadly so much was changed between the novel and the movie, it tears the very beating heart out of the story and renders it meaningless. Even the Shining, as Halloran dubs their abilities, is swept under the rug and seems irrelevant in the film after which it is named. Other major changes from the novel, well it's hard to know where to start there are so many. Just about all of the back story around Jacks alcoholism is ignored. The history of the Overlook is all but ignored. All three main characters differ vastly from their literary counterparts, right down to their hair colour. The Topiary of animals becomes a maze, the roque court, a major element of the novel, just disappears. The pieces that do survive from the book just end up being confusing asides without the background. The casting is very poor, Nicholson comes across as maniacal right from the off and continues to over act his way through the entire film. Duvall seems completely out of place and Danny Torrance displays all the charisma of an empty paper bag. The jarring musical soundtrack is often irritating more than it is effective.

107,20 November 2018,morfunkel,10, A Push Past the Source Material to Something Greater,"All alone in a hotel for months on end, nothing but you your family and the ghosts of the family murdered there. (The Shining) is known as the greatest horror film ever and it has earned that title. This film is able to get you closer and closer to the edge of your with every second passing and keep you guessing at every turn. Terror seeps from just the title of this not only due to the horror themes but because of the direction, story telling, acting, and imagery.
A recovering drunk is trying to land a job to support his wife and five year old wife, so he gets an interview to be the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel. The ensuing months at the hotel turn out to be a little more than the family can take at this hotel. Accompanying the Jack Torrance (the recovering alcoholic) is his wife Wendy who is a typical housewife and their son Danny who happens to have special power. There are a couple other characters in the film but only that plays a role into the story, Halloran. He is the cook of the hotel who happens to share the same ability as Danny.
This movie is not only seen as the greatest horror film but as a great film among all genres. This film is absolutely brilliant it Kubrick hits on every note here. He has a very interesting way of making his films that I find odd sometimes, I like some of his films while I hate some of his others but I love this one and the direction that he took King's story. However the biggest the part of this movie that has stuck with me since first watch and is part of what made me want to be in film is Jack Nicholson's performance. The progression of his character was so perfect and made for such a nail biter. There is in a scene in this movie that made my skin crawl due to his his portrait of Jack Torrance, the ""dull boy"" scene. I saw this movie at a very young age it was never the scariest movie for me upon the first couple viewings but as I got older I started to appreciate the filming techniques used and the acting and the brilliant imagery.
Next to the performances in the movie my favorite part of (The Shining) is the setting. The narrow hallways and open lounging rooms feel very small. Something that I love more anything in horror films is isolation. (The Thing), (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) and even (The Exorcist) all of them create such a tight feeling of isolation. This feeling is created here ten fold with the family being in this huge hotel you wouldn't think so but the surrounding snow keeping them in and having someone in the hotel start to lose it as well as the thoughts that someone might be in the hotel with you harming your child, makes the hotel a lot smaller and smaller. Kubrick made the this place so small and awful for the characters. When the characters have nowhere to run to and nowhere to hide than the viewers feel the same way trapped and stuck and this was felt very strongly for Wendy and Danny.
There is a lot that kubrick added to this story that made it the film the that it is today. A big thing that Kubrick added that King didn't have in the book was the feeling of suspense, the feeling made by unanswered questions. He leaves so many things unknown as far as the mystery of what is going on and what is happening in the hotel. This is what makes the movie a horror film for me. It leaves so much to keep you thinking then all of the sudden another curve ball is thrown and you have to find out what is going on this time.
There is one message that stuck with me throughout this film and was solidified in the end shot is the message that you can not escape your fate. This feels very strong throughout the film as things progress, and it can be seen in some of the characters. I can not get to much into this message or any message without giving away some of the movie for those that have yet to see it.
Before I rewatched this movie the other day I read the novel, I had always wanted to read the novel to see what all the fuse that Stephen King put up about he film. After finishing it I can understand why there was a lot of stuff that was left out including some of the turmoil that Jack Torrance felt about his addiction to alcohol. So I understand why he was upset but I felt Kubrick enhanced the story to make an amazing adaptation of this film. I have seen the film countless times and I love films So naturally I draw more towards them than books but I have read and watched a lot of the greatest horror stories and have liked a lot of the books more and I do not understand how moving the story to the silver screen could mess it up that bad. Watching this movie and reading the book I get why there is a large group that is lead by King in the hate for the adaptation. With all of that being said I felt as though King was spoon feeding me every little detail that he thought of so I am and have always loved the film more that is not to say that I didn't like book I just happen to love the movie.
This is one of the greats. The shining was groundbreaking for films, not just on the horror side of it. The cinematography in this movie is some of the best I have ever scene and the way we are able to dive into a crashing mind to see what is going on is brilliant in this movie there are some thing that happen towards the end of the movie that upset some people but I loved it and I feel it adds to the feeling of the Overlook Hotel as a character. The acting in this movie was amazing and almost perfect. One flaw I had with the movie was Shelley Duvall as Wendy, she played very well when she was terrified but for the scenes when she is calm and happy I find her acting very out of place and like she has the script in her hands to deliver those lines. That is the only problem I can see in this movie though, it ""Shines"" on every other level for me. With only one flaw it is hard to rate this movie on a scale of one to five, so I would give Stanley Kubrick's (The Shining) a 9.5/10.",

I can see why Stephen King hated this movie this is not scary at all it's a slow stupid drama that never lives up to the hype I can't believe I wasted my time watching this but then again I have been fooled before",

And despite it being from 1980 then the movie still holds it own by today's standards, both in storytelling, terror factor and as a wholesome movie.",
116,17 April 2010,st-shot,5, Tracks to nowhere.,Laying down more tracking shots than the Union Pacific did rail during its cross continental building Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is an empty horror flic rich in production design and due to his methodical style void most of the way of suspense. For nearly two and a half hours Kubrick drags his camera around the empty surroundings of a deserted off season hotel and its grounds inexorably building up suspense but failing to follow through as he lets scenes drag on endlessly with superfluous dialog and hollow disjointed action.,

The camera shots are extremly stunning, from the very first shot of the movie to the very last one. There are so many different elements that support different theory about the real meaning of the film that you can believe any of these explenaitions. The film is thematicly intense and scary at points. Kubrick also understand that you dont need to kill a lot of people for the film to be scary. The real reason why its scary is because of the tension built troughout the movie. The plot developement, the pacing, the soundtrack and all the other elements of the film were perfect. We also have to talk about the acting. Jack Nicholson gave one of top 10 acting performances of all time, from his facial expressions to his incredible quotes he was stunning! Shelley Duvall disapeared behind her character, she played it perfectly. Danny Lloyd! He gave THE BEST child actor performance of all time! Has much has adult actors are really good, he gave probably a top 50 acting performances regardless of the age! Stanley Kubrick always made masterpieces, and this movie is not the exception. I would even say its top 10 movies of all time.",

While Carpenter's film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick, Kubrick's is more artistic, more thought-provoking, and probably scarier. It's one of the few films where I can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it. I try not to compare it to the book  which I've only read once, a number of years ago, and which scared me to death  because the two don't have a lot in common, besides the story and characters obviously. It's almost as if Kubrick was banking on people's love of the novel in order to make his film more frightening. And it that way, it's certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations ever made, as well as one of the greatest horror films.",

However, this movie gave me so much chills and freaked me out throughout the movie and even after the movie! ",
122,9 October 2020,matthewnoorman,10, Kubrick Masterpiece,"Before we get started if you havent seen this and have read the book know that this is kubrick version of the story there are many differences between the two.
Kubricks interpretation of the story is amazing if you are open minded enough to accept both the film and the book, if you are so attached to the book that it blinds your judgment you wont like this movie very much. There are spoilers in this review.
Lets start with the performances. Jack's performance is oscar worthy, it is legendary. If you expect him to be the same character in the book you will be too ignorant to accept the fact that jack killed it. He was perfect for kubricks version. He spiraled perfectly out of control. His performance was convincing. Its like it isnt even a performance its really happening. Kubricks directing style is hard on the actors but it doesnt seem that way on screen. Jack and Shelly make it seem easy. Shooting the same scene 50 times is tough and to give an amazing performance time after time, scene after scene is impressive beyond recognition. Many takes also allow for a lot of improve which Jack is a master of.
The score of this film as well as the direction and story telling creates one of the most suspenseful movies of all time. The pacing makes the film intriguing, has you wondering constantly what will happen next.
Danny's performance as well is one of the best child performances in a horror film. For a lil kid to work on a film with kubrick and make it as convincing and authentic as he did, its just mind blowing.
Last I will discuss the differences and why they work. The cook gets killed for a very important reason to showcase Jacks insanity on screen and to provide an on screen murder. Following the book and saving him would ruin the pacing of the film it would be a 2 and a half hour horror film without any big scare. Why did they take out the hedge animals? Because in 1980 it would be corny as all hell and would disrupt the tension kubrick builds throughout the film.
The film focuses on the 3 main characters kubrick stripes away characters that arent crucial to the film. Some people had a problem with it. I don't see why including all the side characters and side stories would be good to the film. It works for the book because kings character work is what makes his writing style. Well movies is a different audience, you want the movie to have more of a linear pacing. You want to develope the main characters. You cant make a 5 hour movie. All suspense and tension goes away when you try to fill the film with everything thats in the book. Its so much information that just wouldnt be able to fit inside of a 2 and a half hour film and still have the same effect as kubricks version.
Finally we come to the biggest difference in the book the hotel burns but in the film the hotel freezes. They took out the boiler aspect of the book because 1 thing Jack chasing his own son with an axe through a maze is much scarier than Jack going down to the basment and then the hotel catches on fire.
Don't be too attachted to the book that you cant enjoy the film because whether you like it or not this is an amazing film. A legendary cult classic and a staple film for the horror genre. Kubrick builds suspense by removing things that are secondary and focusing on the primary elements. Why include all of Jacks past when you are trying to scare people? Jacks backstory makes you feel connected to the character, you understand him in the book and feel sympathetic for him. In the movie he is crazy, he is scary he has to kill halloran it just works, its scarier, its the climax of the film.
To close out I want to point out how great the sets are, the hotel looks amazing and fits the film perfectly. And another element that is overlooked is the sound mixing. Listen to Dannys trycicle travelling through the hotel and how perfect the timing and sound is when he goes from different surfaces like carpet, wood flooring, tiles. Its just so impressive.
The more you watch this film the better it gets. If you dont like it it is because you are too attached to the book. I urge you to try and see it as its own, to see it as kubricks vision.",

127,20 May 2008,mario_c,9, Terrific essay on Human's insanity!,"There's no doubt that SHINING is a major classic of the horror genre, but it's even a bit more than that. It's the horror movie elevated to the ""art status"". I mean, unlike the majority of the horror films which use the same kind of plot, stereotyped characters, clichéd scenes, and worst of all, are produced and reproduced in endless sequels, SHINING is a single and unique piece of ""Horror Art"" (as PSYCHO was until they remember to do the first sequel in 1983). It doesn't mean that SHINING doesn't have some clichéd scenes, because it has indeed (I can remember the scene when WENDY lock herself in the bathroom and tries to escape through that little window where barely could pass her head), but if we ""forget"" about the few clichés it has we really have a good horror film here. On the other hand, in this movie, horror is more symbolic than actually gory. It is mainly symbolic icons which create the horror scenes, so we can definitely say it's more a psychological horror movie than really a gore fest. In fact, there's almost no blood, if we exclude those ""blood waves"" gushing out through the corridors (here it is one of the symbolisms I did refer). More than a horror film, SHINING is a terrific essay about Human's insanity, because it explores until the edge the loss of self control and the irrationality of the Human mind! And to do that disturbed character, JACK TORRANCE, who better than Jack Nicholson?! He really looks like a true lunatic! Superb acting I must say! He has the perfect face, expression, sarcasm! On the opposite side it's the acting by Shelley Duvall, which plays WENDY TORRANCE! It's really bad! She doesn't convince at all playing the victim, as her acting just seems too fake to me! Danny Lloyd, the small kid, also does a nice performance. Excellent film, I score it 9/10!",

133,23 April 2023,hejnoahj,10, Truly a generational masterpiece.,"After reading many reviews of this movie I felt the need to add my own opinion. I saw this movie from a different perspective than many others. I nearly knew the whole plot of the movie before I watched it because most of it was already spoiled for me. So when the movie ended I said out loud ""Was that it?"". But the movie stuck with me. The next week I felt an eeriness and I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was about the movie. Kubrick created a masterpiece because not only was the movie great it was unforgettable. He perfectly managed how to play with your subconscious by adding seemingly meaningless things to the movie that increases the whole vibe of the movie and the reason why you couldn't sit still in your seat even though nothing ""scary"" happened. The reason why when I watched the sequel ""Doctor Sleep"" and Danny drove along the road just like in the opening sequence I nearly stopped breathing. The reason that the connection I felt with the characters nearly made me go crazy just by watching the movie. I understand what people mean when they say that the book did it better. The Idea of a totally normal couple slowly descending into craziness is also extremely scary and even more relatable, but it's unrealistic. From that perspective it's solely the hotel that makes them crazy which is very improbable in the real world. I like to think that they already where on the brink of craziness and the hotel only pushed them over the edge. That the hotel chose them just like it chose the others. The hotel knew it needed weak people to graze it's grounds. I think Kubrick truly mastered the art of film making and with every movie he made he continued to prove himself, and The Shining is definitely not an exception.",

The little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it. We find that the kid has a gift, the ""Shining"". This gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool. Then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy. He goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because... well, he feels like it. Why else would he do it? All of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub. The man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse, which is utterly disgusting. Somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe. Then the kid and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father, who dies within minutes of hypothermia. Most movies aren't a complete waste of time, but this falls right into that category. The music is trashy, the characters are corny (except Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit, the ending is very predictable, the storyline is slow, tedious, and boring.

No film has ever terrified me as much as this, there may have been some others that have made me jump more, but The Shining (Unlike most mainstream horror films nowadays) doesn't rely on cheap jump scares. So many shots and scenes burrow there way into the viewer's mind and never leave them. The Filmmaking is perfect, in my opinion this remains as Stanley Kubrick's best film. Every frame, every scene and every line of dialogue is masterfully helmed. Jack Nicholson's performance here is not only his best but without a doubt one of the greatest of all time. Though Shelly Duval does tend to get a lot of hate for her performance, I'd argue that she was just as great as Jack Nicholson and the fact that she was nominated for a Razzie is utterly insulting. Danny Loyd gives one of the greatest child performances of all time. The Shining is my favorite horror film, my favorite Kubrick film and my favorite film of the entire 80s decade and is of course one of my indisputable favorite films of all time.",

If I had never read the book, I wouldn't have known these things. It had the look of a Tuesday Night Movie of the Week. The whole thing looked rushed. It was a joke. Shelly Duvall and Jack Nicholson both looked like caricatures. Jack Nicholson gives me the creeps anyway, and I can't look at Shelly Duvall without thinking of her as Olive Oyl in POPEYE.

I can only be told so many times how evil and misguided and unsubstantial humanity is over and over and over again before I grow tired of it. I'm perfectly resigned to Kubrick following this childish philosophy on his own works, that's his right as much as it is mine to avoid them.

While there are many like me who love it, there are equally many others who find it unscary and unengaging. Not only that but, somewhat bizarrely, it seems to have also attracted a lot of conspiracy theories surrounding supposed hidden messages and subtexts buried within the film.

Probably my favorite moment was when their boy has gone to the room to get a toy, and we see a shot of Nicholson both on the bed and in a mirror, calling him over.

There are perhaps a half-dozen horror films which terrify on one level and yet explore greater, deeper literary themes. Horror often forces the introspection concerning the nature of the inner and outer realities of human existence. William Friedkin's the Exorcist is one such example, which explores the issues of religious faith within the context of a priest determined to save a girl possessed by a demon. ""Interview with the Vampire"" is another, in which the ""monster"" is all too human, exhibiting all the emotions of their mortal counterparts rather than being deranged and mindless. And ""The Shining"" directed by Kubrick is another, which explores the vulnerability of the family unit, confronting forces far more powerful than itself, and whether that unit can survive.",

The story has not only been adapted but also it has been manipulated by Kubrick, giving the film an uneasy ambivalence, especially at the end. Other than the screenplay, the film rarely faults, and it is always intense and intriguing to watch, even when one does not understand. Technically, it is an ultimate horror experience, with a rather sterling production design and excellent cinematography. Great sound effects and an underplayed haunting music score are able to create an astonishing atmosphere that is perfect for the film. Also generally well acted and rather well directed, it is a shame that the screenplay lets a bravura horror film down, even if it is still excellent nonetheless.",
158,25 February 2017,filipemanuelneto,10, A horror classic.,"This is an indispensable horror classic, which tells of how a former teacher moves with his wife and son to an isolated luxury hotel to work as a caretaker in the months that its closed. What he couldn't know is that the place, where there were already dozens of deaths, is apparently a hot-spot of evil, that only his son can perceive. Its based on a novel by Stephen King, which I unfortunately haven't yet had the pleasure of reading, and is my favorite film of Stanley Kubrick's work. Although it contains extremely violent scenes of carnage and nudity, its relatively contained in comparison to other films I've already seen. From the very beginning, it creates a very pleasant suspense around John Torrence and his family, without ever specifying two things: the nature of John's son's gift and the nature of the evil that inhabits the hotel. Two things that it purposely leaves open, perhaps to increase the impact of the end. Jack Nicholson played the lead character and I think its fair to recognize that it was the most challenging and iconic role of his career. He was fantastic, and his body and facial expression helped immensely to make him more real. The same thing can be said of Shelley Duvall, who was incredible as Mrs. Torrence, harmonizing well feelings of disbelief, fear, powerlessness and urgency to act and protect herself and her child. The film has good special and visual effects, as well as an excellent and credible set. For the last, a final note to warn that it is a movie unsuitable for faint-hearted.",
159,16 February 2021,Cineanalyst,9, The Mad Author,"A classic example of a masterpiece initially underappreciated but subsequently celebrated, Stanley Kubrick's horror film, ""The Shining,"" is a striking exploration of a maze of architectural space and a haunting portrayal of the creative process and extreme writer's block. Adapted from Stephen King's novel, the film is famously unfaithful--adding psychological ambiguity to the supernatural haunted house fluff (complete with being built on an Indian burial ground). In the film, it's indefinite whether the surrogate writer on screen is writing the horrors of the Overlook Hotel or if the building is writing his descent into madness and to what degree the son interferes. King's animosity for the adaptation aside, it's an apt cinematic transmutation of the reflexive textual basis of the author-character into the visual exegesis of cinema in moving through space and time and as embodied by the building's ghosts and the ESP ""shining"" of the characters.",

Masterfully directed by Kubrick, this flick is enthralling from start to finish. The imagery throughout is both haunting and unforgettable and the cinematography is ahead of it's time. The small cast of actors all do a great job but Nicholson is absolutely mesmerizing.

164,8 February 2022,iquine,10, Crescendo of Madness,"Kubrick and Nicholson slowly devolve Jack Torrance into insanity using their masterful skills. Kubrick's long takes, often full of excruciating tension and lack of sound, accentuate his Torrance's emotional state....or lack of emotion in many moments. Often the viewer is forced to ponder, while squirming in their seat, what is about to happen. Modern movies rely on loud bangs to make the audience jump. Not here! Anxiety is slowly burned into the viewer as they have ample time to think during long takes and unexpected revelations that slowly stack up into impactful moments. This is a complex story and arguably open to interpretation yet it focuses on the Torrance family as they agreed to be caretakers of the vast Overlook Hotel, located in isolation up in the mountains, for the cold winter months. The hotel becomes are character itself as the family gets acquainted with it and we learn there was a murder here many years ago. Was it brought on by the constant isolation or something inherent within the hotel? Anyway, this film scared the pants off me when I saw it in a dark open basement in high school.

The only explanation I can come up with is the responses are affected by what I can the ""Genius Effect"" and time. The Genius Effect (which I'm sure someone else probably has coined - but if not, I'll take credit!) would dictate that if the filmmaker is a genius, then the film is a work of genius and must be excellent. Since I don't consider Kubrick a genius, I don't think all he had done was great. Some of it was OK, probably the best was FULL METAL JACKET, but I digress. I do think this point has some merit because reviews of Eyes Wide Shut were very good and, very recently, it was revealed that Kubrick himself thought it was bad (see Guardian Unlimited Film, http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1888077,00.html).",

But Shining actually turned out to be as good as most viewers has described it. This is not one of the scariest movies but it still has very unique and eerie atmosphere which it maintains through out the whole duration of the movie. Performances of everyone are quite good, especially that of Jack Nicholson. I also have to praise the performances of two actors Joe Turkel & Philip Stone who played relatively minor roles but both stole their respective scenes through their awesome acting. Script of the film is just fantastic. There are so many powerful scenes that give a highly creepy vibe without the use of excessive blood or gore. This movie can work as both a psychological horror as well as supernatural thriller. Overall, this is a masterpiece by Stanley Kubrick. I wish he had made more horror movies.",

169,7 February 2022,koltonbrett,5, The REDRUM of a Great Story,"Can a movie be both bad and good? This movie definitely switches back and forth between the two. For fans of the book, this movie is pretty hard to swallow. It's vastly different. There is simply too much not to like about it. Even Stephen King, the king of horror, the great mind behind this truly interesting concept and story, didn't like it. But for every reason I can give for why I don't like it, someone else could give a reason for why they love it. It's that kind of movie. One look at its IMDb score reveals that it's obviously loved by many and is seen as a classic. There are some things to appreciate here, but mostly this movie falls in the category of ""so bad it's good."" It's a very artsy film with eerie visuals and music. The latter was almost painful at times, like ringing in my ears. Jack Nicholson's performance is undeniably entertaining but his character is despicable. In the book, Jack Torrance is a decent guy, a family man who isn't perfect but he's trying. He's someone you can root for. The movie's version of this character is unlikable and comes across as sinister and crazy pretty much from the start. Jack's wife and son are incredibly annoying throughout the movie. The performances by Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd didn't do these characters any favors. I have no desire to ever see Danny doing his ""Tony"" voice and finger talking ever again. And Shelley Duvall has us wondering if Jack lost his mind due to the ghosts of the Overlook or due to how annoying her character is. There are indeed unsettling moments throughout the movie, but I can't say this horror film ever gets scary. The supernatural element of the story is greatly downplayed. Jack didn't seem to need all that much help losing his mind. In the end, The Shining is a long movie that doesn't tell a whole lot of story. A lot of time is taken up with scenes that build on the mood and tone of the film but don't add much to the overall story. In other words, it's a bit slow. This movie is definitely a piece of art, but it's missing many of the most memorable moments from King's book. The Overlook hotel is the perfect setting for this story. It's both beautiful and spooky. This could have been a truly terrifying movie.",

The imagery is breathtaking. So many iconic scenes and images that leave a lasting impression on your mind. And this is what people remember.
But then, you start to think about the actual story. Jack Torrence's slow decent into madness was neither slow, surprising or influenced by his environment. And that's what really kills this movie. I can honestly say, if the Overlook was not haunted, this movie, as presented, would have had the exact same ending. It is really a look into an imbittered drunk who goes mad from cabin fever. Everything that goes on around him is irrelevant. Is that the point? If so, it is truely a wasted opportunity as now any adaptation that is made in the future will be judged against this and be panned for telling an actual story.

The scenery and music in the opening credits are eerily horrifying right off the bat. The character of Jack Torrance would not have a better role if it wasn't done by Jack Nicholson. The small supporting cast of Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Scatman Crothers and Barry Nelson were equally great in the film. Although there were terrific performances, the real star was The Overlook Hotel and the masterful way Kubrick portrayed the evilness of the place. The film develops itself very slowly and builds itself into complete insanity. The horror scenes that include the twin girls, Room 237 and the stairway are all freaky and expertly shot. When the ending comes it does come as a shock because the vast majority of viewers have no idea what just happened. It takes multiple viewing and additional research to completely understand King's and Kubrick's deranged story that is The Shining.",
173,24 December 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," Fails a little for a horror flick, but still a pretty good job by Kubrick","I've heard many claim this to be a failure, either due to it straying too far from the book(something that apparently ticked King off, though he wasn't the first writer to be less than satisfied with Kubrick's adaptation of their work) or due to Kubrick's love for setting a mood and building atmosphere ruining the scares, at least if you're into sudden shocks, gore and stuff like that. Personally, I don't care too much about the source material... of course, that's probably due to my distinct dislike of Stephen King. But a good story is a good story, no matter who or where it came from. And the better part of the good story here may have come from Kubrick, and it may have come from King. I don't really care. I will admit that the film does fail in some areas, though, as a horror film. The scares are not as constant as they feel they should be, and the film only really works on the atmospheric level. The atmosphere and mood is great. No doubt about that. The film has a nice mysterious feel to it, nothing is explained in too much detail. The story is pretty good, as well as thoroughly interesting and involving. I saw this film once before, years ago... and even though I didn't understand too much of it, I liked it a lot. Particularly because of the story and the atmosphere. The plot is very good, interesting and involving. The pacing is quite good, there are only a few scenes where you're somewhat bored. I believe this is mainly because Kubrick wasn't too used to horror movies... or maybe his approach to the genre just wasn't the best. Through his career, Kubrick went through just about every single movie genre, often only making a single movie in each genre. That might be the reason some of his movies(this one and Full Metal Jacket, mainly) aren't as good as his better movies(A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Dr. Strangelove). The acting is good, though it can be argued that the two leads, Nicholson and Duvall, overplay and underplay, respectively, at times. The characters are well-written and credible, though it can be argued that some of them are a little thin. The special effects are great, and still hold up today. All in all, a pretty good horror film, and a very good Kubrick film, but definitely not for all tastes. I recommend it to fans of Kubrick, atmospheric horror films, atmospheric films in general, and possibly fans of the actors involved. 8/10",

Everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality. All that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley. The hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too. A word about the actors Jack Nicholson looks like a lost,lazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do.

It is scary the whole way through. The Shining is even more chilling than the icy Colorado setting it takes place in. It is the only movie that I can say has truly lingered with me when I think about what the scariest movies are. Second off, The Shining doesn't just earn a 10 because it's so very scary. This is a cinematic masterpiece. A horror masterpiece. Thank you, Stanley Kubrick. The Shining is timeless. Every single scene is crafted exquisitely. The set of the Overlook Hotel is luxurious. Kubrick's direction is immaculate. Stanley's camera throughout tells one wicked tale from frame to frame, as it's always lurking and ever present, overlooking the characters themselves as if it's the Overlook Hotel watching them. What some people describe is 'boring', and 'slow', is actually setting the tone beautifully for the tensest scenes. The Shining's not slow. That's why it's so great. The Shining is a movie that I just love. It's so awesome. I do have a hard time watching it over and over again because it scares the living bejeebies out of me, but whenever I do watch it, I fall right back into it and it is so good. Jack Nicholson as Jack is incredible in one of the very best and most referred to roles in all of cinematic history. Shelley Duvall as Jack's wife, Wendy Torrance, is just as exceptional. This is Stephen King's best on screen adaptation of one of his novels. Kubrick's ending is superior to King's. The Shining is insanely scary.

200,5 November 2021,barryrd,6, The Shining - gloomy and uninspiring amid spectacular shots,"At the start, I was drawn into the movie with the aerial filming of a vehicle driving through the Colorado Mountains. Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance is driving to a mountain hideaway for an interview at the Overlook Hotel for a job lasting through the winter at a snowbound hotel. Despite the serious isolation, which he is warned about, he takes the job and brings his family - his wife played by Shelley Duvall and child Danny Lloyd. This is where Jack is going to write his magnum opus, the great book he has never been able to take on. The first flag that goes up for me is why would anyone take a job involving such a long stretch of time, especially with his loved ones. It's not as if they can go skiing everyday or have access to big screen entertainment...just a long period of solitude doing routine work inside the hotel. To make matters worse, the sheer size of the immense hotel only worsens the loneliness. His 7 year old spends time cycling along the lengthy corridors. The mother and boy get lost in a giant maze of hedges, one scene that was terrifying. There are a few staff at the hotel and one in particular, Dick Halloran, played by Scatman Crothers, who warns them about the maze and the hotel's past as a crime scene. Predictably Jack and his family become a bit stir crazy with the grand, snowbound place which is soon engulfed in a the worst snowstorm in many years. The worst is yet to come as Jack, a recovering alcoholic, resumes drinking and becomes more antisocial and violent in his behaviour. The hotel management didn't exercise what would be considered due diligence in hiring him and worse allowing him to come with his family. Presumably, they were happy to get someone there regardless of the huge personal cost, not to say the risk to all involved. Stanley Kubrick is considered one of the great directors of all time and visually, the movie is stunning in many ways - from getting lost in the maze to the camera work of the boy on his tricycle, the aerial photography and the deep focus shots inside the huge hotel. I didn't find it scary but a pointless showcase of blood and violent attacks. I much prefer the high suspense associated with movies like Psycho or Halloween. I had to see this movie again to revisit my previous impression and while it does have some merit, it is still for me a major disappointment.",

Jack Nicholson in an excellent performance takes on a job as a caretaker for an isolated hotel during the harsh winter when it is closed. He slowly goes insane and is haunted by the past horrors of the hotel. The score featuring Wendy Carlos is one of the eeriest in film history and is the backbone to the film.,
210,30 October 2014,RossRivero99,10, a horror masterpiece,"Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is nothing short of a creepy masterpiece which is an ingenious adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name. The movie stars Jack Nicholson in his best performance as Jack Torrance a former school-teacher, turned writer, and now is applying for a hotel job for the entire winter and takes his wife Wendy (played by Shelley Duvall) and their only son Danny (played by Danny Lloyd) to this beautiful looking hotel called the Overlook , and then Torrance starts to get really insane trying to kill his wife and son because from what I believe is because he didn't get to spend time with them or maybe he was writing for too much time. This spellbinding horror film is arguably Kubrick's greatest achievement along with 2001: a Space Odyssey (1968), Spartacus (1960), and Dr. Strangelove (1964). This movie just made me not keep my eyes away from the screen because of how masterful this movie really is. One thing I am really disappointed with is that when my parents compare this film to The Omen (1976) I don't get how they think that that film was better than this movie when it actually wasn't because it had more suspense, and more creeps for which The Omen didn't, And by the way if you are one of those people who think that The Omen is better than The Shining I really do recommend that you watch them both again and you will know when you change your mind.",

212,18 June 2014,tangietangerine,10, (Another) Kubrick Masterpiece,"This is definitely my favorite Kubrick movie, despite being also a die-hard Stephen King fan, I love what he did to this adaptation. It really did change the very essence of the characters from the novel and went to completely different grounds. Jack Nicholson gives an (as usual) over-the-top performance as Jack Torrance, and I think one of the great things about it is that he combines utter psychopathic behavior with a dark, sarcastic humor..which i'd attribute to Kubrick's writing. Still, needless to say, it's an amazing masterpiece. The atmosphere of isolation and eeriness it creates is beyond anything i've ever experienced in probably any other horror film. It's not one of those movies that makes you jump in your chair or feel disgusted by all the gore and killing, in fact, it does the opposite of what we'd expect. One example is that scene where Wendy discovers all the ""work"" Jack that has done in the past few months, the pages filled with endless crazy repetitions of the same sentence. In that scene, we see Jack as he is approaching her, which gives us a heads-up of what's going to come next, even though it still scares the crap out of us when he finally appears before her. That's one of the reasons why it's still frightening and relevant even after 34 years!",

A family of 3 look after a hotel for the winter and while the son suffers horrifying supernatural visions, the father slowly descends into madness. Stanley Kubrick directs, and he is a very diverse director who made films of many different genres. His sole journey into horror is one of the best horror films of all time, and probably the one with the biggest influence on popular culture. Truth be told, it's not the masterpiece some say it is. While the book is an extremely powerful drama and character study wrapped up in a haunted house master-class, this is just a haunted house master-class. Danny Lloyd gives one of the great child actor performances and Jack Nicholson's legendary turn as Jack Torrance is one of the greatest performances in horror history but Shelley Duvall gives the worst performance in a good movie ever and I'm pretty sure Jack going mad wasn't just to do with the hotel.

222,10 June 2008,metalrules31,9," The Shining, a masterpiece of thriller movies","The Shining is a 1980 movie by Stanley Kubrick, whom by now has become my favorite director. The movie is based on Stephen King's novel by the same name. The story tells us of Jack Torrance, a retired teacher and now writer, who plans to spend his winter, along with his family, at the Overlook Hotel as the caretaker. The isolation of the place seems to be the perfect condition for Jack's inspiration to flow. His wife Wendy, seems to agree with this decision, but their son, Danny, seems not to like this idea. Doc, as his parents call him, possesses a special talent, a so-called imaginary friend by the name of Tony, whom reveals him future visions. Danny later learns through Mr. Halloran, the hotel's chef, whom posses that same power, called ""The Shining"", power which also allows the to communicate through some sort of telepathy. From this point on, they are left alone and the story starts becoming awkward. Jack locks himself to type and Danny strolls down on his tricycle through the Overlook's hallways, creating one of the mos memorable scenes of the movie. The mere sound of the vehicle's wheels rolling on the carpet and then on the wooden floor help get the mood right. Mood which is only made creepier by Kubrick's imagery. A pair of twin girls, an elevator filled with blood and the mysterious room 237. Jack on the other hand has been having some mysterious encounters with other people on the supposedly empty hotel, and in a conversation with whom he believes to be the caretaker who killed his own family, is that he is finally revealed to have some sort of background inside the hotel, and is also lead into ""correcting"" his son and wife. The typewriter continuously clicking on various scenes, makes us believe of Jack's efficient work, but when Wendy manages to enter and read his papers, all she finds are pages and pages filled with the phrase: ""All work and no fun, makes jack a dull boy"". After a first fight where Wendy knocks Jack with a bat and locks him in the storage room, is that we learn that all the weird things going on are not just in the Torrances heads, but that there indeed are other forces at work, which manage to open the locked door to Jack, hand him an Ax, and change his mind once and for all into killing his family. Jack heads towards the family's room, where Wendy and Danny are hiding in the bathroom. Danny escapes through a window, which is too small for Wendy. Jack makes his way through the locked doors with the help of an Ax, and exclaims the movie's most memorable quote: ""Heeeeeres Johnny!"". Jack gets his hand cut by Wendy and decides it's better to chase Danny. the boy leads him into a maze and finally to Jack's freezing death, which allows Danny and his mom to escape. Jack Nicholson is amazing, he is perfect for the role, somehow mad men roles fit him perfectly. Whether it is in Batman, The Departed or even Anger Management, Jack's most sane role, ironically, is One Fleew Over The Cuckoo's Nest's McMurphy. Shelley Duvall is also quite perfect to me. Her dialogs seem scared when they ought to be and determined when they need to. Finally, Danny, played by Danny Lloyd makes a respectable job, but always subject to some limitations due to his early age. Stanley Kubrick made all of this possible on his screen adaptation of the novel, which Stephen King considered ""Not that faithful to the book"". Its dialogs, sequences and specially its imagery are what have made out of this movie such a classic of not only cinema, but of popular culture. References which can be found on The Simpsons or even in Slipknot's video for Spit it Out, to name a few. The soundtrack by Wendy Carlos fits perfectly, its highlights being the simplicity of the main theme, and the piercing screech when the shining is used. So, you may wonder. What makes this movie so scary? There are no alien invasion, epidemic diseases and the ghost do not act directly on people (except the lady from the 237). The terror applied by King and Kubrick relies on the terror caused by the mere idea of being tried to kill by someone you love, and who is supposed to protect you. In any conversation of terror movies, The Shining will always be present.",

The problem with this movie was the ending.  I would have had more respect for it if Kubrick would have ended it differently.  And, the over all movie was just stupid.

When it first came out was killed by the critics and the audiences ,but over time it gather a devout following and it has become a classic of the horror genre as a whole and one of the best movies made by Stanley Kubrik. I can not say( OK write tactically ) for this one because what can you add on a flick which cane out in 1980 and it has been studied for literally decades!! A quick summary is that a couple goes to a hotel ,which is closed during the winter and after some weird events the father goes starts to lose his sanity ( to be fair is played by Nicholson who is born to play nut characters, for real his most famous characters are of their minds). Its scariness is not due to some stupid jumped scares, but the tone and the atmosphere is the true reason, it really makes the movie at times, creepy as f**k. It is also true that after the end of the shooting the building ,which was used as the hotel ,was buried to the ground ,no clue how did that happen!! So if their is a ghost there in the end then ,it may dislike the final product, man even in death some people do not have any taste.

But sorry guys the truth has to be told, and yes everyone's perception matters its the whole lot of perception that make or break a matter.

I am an avid horror fan and have seen from gore and violent movies (Zombie flicks) to complicated (Donny Darko)to completely non-sense movies. But nothing even comes close to this. I saw Zombie Holocaust a day back and thought that no movie can be worst, I'm still correct but maybe it was all the overhype and the anticipation that made me absolutely NOT LIKE The Shinning. I mean why is the movie even called ""The Shining"", it should be called, Jack Nicholson Balding, cuz that's what's the camera mostly covers. His balding spot(s). The end is the worst ending ever possible and nothing makes sense. If a ghost can unlock the door, why cant he kill the mother and the kid? If the Perverted Black Cook had the Shine and knew something was wrong, why didn't he bring a weapon? Was he mentally blinded by the Shine??? Or was he thinking he was macho enuf? For all I know Jack may have just forgotten a fuse outside somewhere and his wife would have found it and it would still be the same movie, now Stanley wishes he had called it the Balding.... Plus I rally didn't feel claustrophobic and or scared almost never. The only time I got a little (yes it was a tiny winy little wittle moment) when I saw the old lady.

I recognize, however, that books and films are two different mediums, therefore, have storytelling devices unique to the manner in which they work with a narrative. Stephen King's vocal and vehement opposition to the 1980 film by Stanley Kubrick means quite little to me. He may be right, the work originated with him, obviously, but films are different than books and should be appreciated as a separate entity rather than an extension of one another. I also wouldn't classify myself as a fan of Stanley Kubrick. That's not to say I don't think he's made some wonderful films---he has, I just don't list him among my favorites which make me an ideal candidate to speak evenly about his film and King's book. Kubrick's film starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall tell the tale of a writer and his family who become caretakers of a hotel with a dark history on a secluded mountain in Colorado.

254,17 October 2020,007Waffles,6, Meh...,"The film is interesting and worth watching once. The cinematography and set design are great. However, I would say it's way to long. It has really drawn out scenes and major continuity issues. No need for the ""eerie"" violin noise throughout the entire film. I get it. These people are weird and something bad is going to happen. No need to hammer the point in.
Also, the wife is throughout the entire film. I thought she was a bad actress. There is no character development because she acts hysterical the entire time.
Jack Nicholson was great. He made the film what it is.

255,15 December 2022,ambusched94,8," Consider it as a standalone horror film and it's terrific. If you compare it to Stephen King's book, it's a very poor adaptation","As a standalone film, The Shining by Stanley Kubrick is a deliriously, eerie, slow burn horror suspense film. As a film adaptation of The Shining book by Stephen King, it fails. However, I understand it was likely not Kubrick's intention to create a film that fired on all cylinders to capture the book's exact plot and character development and motivation page-by-page (so thankful though there's a '90s TV miniseries which excellently delivers on everything including performances too!).",
256,25 January 2019,davedflores,9, Kubrick's vision of King's The Shining,"When it comes to Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film, The Shining, there are not many movies that can show the slow and uneasy turn to insanity that someone like Jack Torrance experiences. The movie's simple plot: a family lives in a hotel in the mountains, to keep it in good working condition for the spring time. Jack Torrance slowly loses his mind as his own thoughts are the loudest thing in the hotel.
The film is groundbreaking and influential, not only for the industry as a whole, but also for what I hope to emulate on day and improve on. The films application of color was unnoticed to most, once the audience has knowledge about that theory, it changes the whole perspective, giving the viewers a roller coast of emotion.
When it comes to the editing of The Shining, the long and growingly uncomfortable shots make the audience notice even the most minor of details, from Jack raising his eyebrows to Wendy's growing fear on her face. The pacing of the film is something that most films cannot replicate, the exponential increase in horror and tension near the end of the film seems to come out of nowhere for the average viewer, but more people more in-depth with the knowledge of the industry, it is obvious from the start. The perspective of the film is highlighting Jack, who is a struggling writer, trying to finish a book that he started, giving himself space to think. His own mind ends up being the jail cell he was trying to escape.
The Shining is a great film, that will stand the test of time. Though Stephen King wasn't a fan of it, most critics welcome The Shining with open arms, excited to see another one of Kubrick's creations.",

Instead, it's all about creating psychological intensity. The acting is excellent, the plot builds, and the tension keeps increasing until the climax. This movie may include the most haunting carpet patterning and wallpaper of all time. The production team kicked it into overdrive to create sets that you won't forget. My only gripe with the movie is that I found the soundtrack a tad over the top. Otherwise, there's not much to say in praise of the movie that dozens of others haven't said better already.

I just feel, as did King, that Kubrick's The Shining butchered his story and it does exactly that. I guess supposedly The Shining's artistic value is huge being that Kubrick is such a brilliant director but I don't see anything to the film that makes it such a Kubrick masterpiece. The core ideas are still in tact from the film but it seems as though Kubrick rushes everything through and in the process leaves all the meat and potatoes of the characters and the story in the dust. The characters in the film have virtually no depth, they are very shallow characters and the casting for the important roles couldn't have been more wrong. That being said Kubrick's The Shining makes a great horror story and is downright disturbing in numerous scenes. It gets a lot of it's ""classic"" status from many of it's more disturbing scenes including the blood in the elevator, REDRUM, the disturbing portrayal of Danny, and of course Nicholson's infamous portrayal of the madman but the problem with all of this is the story around it is so weak. You don't see Nicholson's decent into madness, it practically happens on a dime, and you don't get a sense of the evil hotel, everything just lumps together quickly, and the ending of the film makes such little sense that it leaves you frustrated and scratching your head.",
268,16 March 2020,a_chinn,9, Terrific haunted house story is not as scary as it once was,"I recently rewatched ""The Shining"" on the big screen at a revival showing and was struck by how it has aged and now only seems mildly frightening. I remember being terrified of the twins, the elevators of blood, and Jack in the hedge maze. Still, even though the film has lost some of its scare factor, ""The Shining"" is a fabulous piece of cinema. I won't bother summarizing the plot, because this is a film everyone has seen and if you haven't watch it NOW. Masterfully directed by Stanley Kubrick, his use of the Steadicam gives the film a dreamlike quality, floating though the empty hotel hallways and hedge mazes, which beautifully compliments the film's supernatural story. This was a new technique at the time and it still stands out as one of my best uses of this technology (Scorceses use of it in ""Goodfellas"" is probably the other standout). Although not as edge of your seat as contemporary horror films (Mike Flanagan's ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is an excellent example of a film that manages to be both scary and intelligent, which ""The Shining"" was in it's day), but Kubrick's film does maintain a wonderfully creepy atmosphere. The photography by John Alcott (""Barry Lyndon"" ""A Clockwork Orange"" ""The Beastmaster"") is as gorgeous. It's interesting to note that this is a haunted house story shot on brightly sunlight sets, compared to the typical dark-and-stormy-night setting of most horror films. Roy Walker's production design and Leslie Tompkins art direction are both beautiful and terrifying in their starkness. No review of ""The Shining"" would be complete without mentioning Kubrick's masterful selection of music for the film. Wendy Carlos provided a few pieces, but a majority of the frightening music were compositions that, believe it or not, already existed. This film introduced me to György Ligeti, Krzysztof Penderecki, and Béla Bartók. Kurbrik brilliantly places the music into the film to a highly effective degree. Thematically, there are many theories on what the film is about (see the hilarious documentary ""Room 237"" for some outrageous theories, though that film is less about the dissecting ""The Shining"" and is more about how people get sucked into conspiracy theories and look to make order, seeking out patters and connections where they don't actually exist), but what the story of ""The Shining"" really boils down to is the horrors and challenges family, parenting, and marriage. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Jack is having a midlife crisis. He wants to be a writer, but he now has responsibilities, a wife and a child who he increasingly beings to view as getting in the way of his life. He even tells Loyd, the ghostly bartender, at one point that he's losing who he is. From Wendy's perspective, Jack doesn't appreciate her cheerfully running the house and Wendy begins to lose her own mind over this as well, while poor Danny is caught in the middle. Looking for an escape from his responsibilities, Jack begins drinking again (he's a recovering alcoholic) and is even tempted by another woman at one point. Minus all the supernatural elements, this really is a domestic drama. This all was more at the forefront of King's book, which got watered down somewhat for the film version since Nicholson goes crazy pretty much right off that bat, which is a negative point on the film and was the crux of King's outspoken criticism of the film. King much preferred the TV-mini series version directed by Mick Garris and with Steven Weber as Jack Torrance. That version is much closer to the book and the highly identifiable Weber much better conveys King's focus on the horror of seeing your very ordinary father wrestle with his demons versus the very unordinary Nicholoson (no one's dad is like Jack Nicholson), but the TV-mini series is nowhere as cinematic as Kubrick's big screen opus. Overall, ""The Shining"" remains a classic, but it is a film that has lost some of its sparkle over the years, mostly likely due to it being endlessly copied, which consequentially leaves the film feel somewhat stale by comparison. Irregardless, it remains a compelling and visually stunning film to behold.",

I think the first horror movie ominous aerial view may be in this flick, now a horror trope. This is one of the first movies that is better than the book. It happens nowadays but in the 20th century it was unheard of. A family moves into an upscale hotel in the Rockies for the winter. The daddy, Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) has been hired as the caretaker for the winter closing. The hotel is in lock-down until spring and Jack's job is to take care of the building and grounds. Everybody else in the huge building will be gone until then, everybody. The tiny family will be snowed in with the first storm and it will be just the three of them. Even the phones go down with the heavy snows. Jack isn't the soundest guy and his son Danny (Danny Lloyd) is even more unwound.

Directed by masterful director Stanley Kubrick, this film went down as one of the greatest modern day horror masterpieces. Although Stephen King will ""kindly"" disagree. The movie is borderline sadistic in how it psychologically messes with the audience. The amount of twists and turns add up to one hell of a psychological thriller that made a mess out of my brain. The film maintains an eerie atmosphere throughout the film and it never settles until days after the end credits rolled. Jack Nicholson delivers another career-defining performance as Jack Torrance. The actor's charisma and scary demeanor matches the tone of the movie perfectly. However, Shelley Duvall quite literally took me out of the movie at times with her blubbering performance.",

This movie is very creepy and scary. The first scene is one of the legendary scenes. The camera follows a car through a mountain wilderness and very dramatic eerie music plays. There are others such as when the son comes across two ghost twin girls while riding his tricycle or something, when an elevator opens and what looks like blood pours out as if the elevator was full of blood, and when the father encounters a ghost in a room.

And if you haven't, then please stop reading the review, because you won't be happy with what I have to say. I hate when directors take the source material and make their own thing from it. Sure, Tarkovsky did that, but we can forgive him, as his movies are something else entirely. What Kubrick does with this movie is sacrilege. First, let it be said that Nicholson's performance is good, but his performance isn't the problem. It's his character. King, I think, said it himself. Character of Jack Torrance is pretty much mad the moment we see him for the first time and he is just reaching the boiling point. That's a first and fatal mistake. His transformation was the highlight of the book. Second big problem is probably the miscast of the decade made on the first year of the decade. Shelley Duvall. This woman doesn't look like she is capable of doing anything, yet alone defend herself and the child from a husband who has gone mad. Wendy in the book was a smart and capable woman and you knew it from the start Jack and her are equal and that she won't give up without a big, bloody fight! Hallorann is killed in the movie. Also not at all needed change. The ending is changed (because Kubrick didn't have the money to blow up the set). It's just... I'm sorry, but as an adaptation of a book, this movie is a big fail and doesn't deserve more than 6/10! What is more, this movie made me read all of King's books before watching the adaptations so I don't get tricked like a lot of people got with this movie. If the movie was made as an original piece of work, I would have probably liked it a lot more.

291,21 November 2006,tsf-1962,10, home sweet horror,"""The Shining"" is my favorite horror movie. I can relate to the theme of family dysfunction--the alcoholic, abusive father; the frightened, overwhelmed mother; and the withdrawn, almost autistic child--because it mirrors my own childhood experience, just as the family's isolation as caretakers for an abandoned hotel recall certain events when I was growing up. I don't want to go into too much autobiographical detail here so I'll focus on the film. ""The Shining"" has all the motifs common to Kubrick's films starting with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"": a cold, impersonal narrative tone; harsh, bright lighting; and brilliant musical choices, especially Bela Bartok's ""Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta."" The photography is brilliant, especially the use of the then-new Steadicam, which Kubrick was to use to good advantage seven years later in ""Full Metal Jacket."" As in all of Kubrick's films, the theme is survival in a barren, absurd cosmos. Danny Lloyd is simply the best child actor I've ever seen, and Shelly Duval's very plainness makes her all the more believable as an average housewife and mother. It's ironic that Stephen King disliked the film because he thought Jack Nicholson hammed it up too much as Jack Torrance: how do you underplay a homicidal maniac?

I think it's not a horror after all, it's an unclassified-genre, a Kubrick's very own genre. For me, it is not scary, maybe because the cultural gap between the western and eastern. The Asian-horror, usually frightening young woman appears as ghost, is my cultural-horror. I mean, you know ghost, in every culture is different. At the one hand, if you believe in ghost or those mythical things, this movie is worth to watch, it's from Stephen King's novel itself. In the other hand, if you don't believe, don't worry, Kubrick make another alternative to enjoy this movie. Watch it as a psychological-problem-movie, with suspenseful scene in it. So, two perspective in a movie, who could believe that, but Kubrick made it true. And about its difference from the novel, I don't know if you are a novel reader or what. But, I do appreciate King as the writer, he has good sense in writing mystery-novel. I haven't read the novel though, but King as writer, had done a great job. For Kubrick, you may say, he had torture the masterpiece of writing. So, King is right to defend his work of art. But Kubrick also had a fantastic sense of cinematography, that's why it's okay for him to change the story a little too far. Anyway, I adore both of them.",

King who's novel is long and drawn out and it goes into more detail as is the case with most books. Kubrick on the other hand made the film long also yet his focus was more of an enchanting and psychological chilling visual masterpiece. Stanley was always so good for the fact that when shooting his films the scenes shot were always done in a manner of detail with a great camera touch. You add this with the performance of Jack Nichoslon(my favorite actor)who's over the top and out right crazy here with his role as was so common in his acting roles(example: ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and as the ""Joker"" in ""Batman"") ""The Shining"" turns out to be a horror masterpiece as most agree it was one of Warner Brothers most acclaimed and successful films of all time.",

The remaining 2h 31m was filled with boring, stretched out hallucinations, radio calls, conversations that don't relate to a plot, and Jack Nicholson losing his temper.

Right from the opening sequence, it is chillingly artistic. The Shining has actually undergone a remarkable public reappraisal over the past three decades.

Which brings us to the point:  I think ""The Shining"" is a great novel, a truly scary entry in it's genre.  Like many King novels, it is about wasted people who become vessels of or for evil.  That may sound silly, but try comparing ""Dolores Claiborne"" (also an excellent film) with ""'Salem's Lot"" or ""The Dead Zone"" or ""Gerald's Game"", and you'll find there's more there than just sharp teeth or things that go bump in the night.  ""The Shining"" is, in its simplest form, the study of a man who is a failure at everything he does, including becoming an alcoholic.  This is not a paean to King, however, or to suggest that he's a misunderstood Shakespeare.  There is more to his novels than a serious reader or filmgoer would suspect, and Kubrick leaves most of the meat of this story out of the film.",

And, to a certain extent, understandably so. Throughout the years, many filmmakers have seemingly had great difficulty in recalling a basic principle: horror as a genre is first and foremost a subgenre of fantasy. Whereas grotesque and bloody images instantly get the audience to react, fantasy is an immersive genre that, when properly delivered, engenders a momentary detachment from reality, thereby keeping the audience in captivity within an atmosphere in which the oddest stories may unfold. This is the gist of horror cinema, and the films that actually manage to provide this type of experience are a rarity.",

But the casting of the film was all wrong, except for Scatman Crothers as Halloran. It is his murder, among the other changes from the book that disappointed many King fans. I also felt cheated when they substituted the maze for the scenes in the Topiary Garden and the playground, which to me were some of the most terrifying in the book.

But Nicholson looks and acts psycho from the get-go, making it is no surprise when he actually does go crazy.  Considering King's novels are usually terrible (come on, a car that kills people named Christine?) ""The Shining"" was a haunting account of the hotel effects on the gradual demise of Jack's psyche.  And what's with Tony morphing into this friend that ""lives in Doc's mouth""?

On its own, the movie is one of the best in its genre but if you have never read the book, do yourself a favor and do so. Having never read a King novel before, I was impressed. The book was excellent. The depth of characters is so vastly different from those depicted in the film. You actually like the Jack of the book! You 'feel' for him. You understand him. Some of the action of the story too has been altered in the film, and in my opinion, not for the better. I plan to watch Stephen King's The Shining now as I understand it more closely resembles his original story and is more in line with what the author wanted the Stanley Kubrick film to be.

Now don't get me wrong here. Kubrick is a master at his craft. His camera is always right where it should be. The scenes shot with steadicam are divine. The problem is that Kubrick is a cold filmmaker. Do we care about the Torrance's and their plight? Nope. Are any of the shocking scenes of horror really that shocking?

The title represents a psychic ability that renders communication through the mind. The Overlook Hotel is closing for the winter months and a new caretaker arrives. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrence, former professor now writer who slowly descends into madness stemming from a child abuse incident involving his son. Shelley Duvall plays his wife, Wendy who remains optimistic until bruises appear on their son's neck. Danny Lloyd plays their son Danny who has the shining and sees visions of murdered twin girls. Scatman Crothers plays the head chef who communicates with Danny through shining and becomes determined to oversee the safety of the boy through a blistering blizzard. Philip Stone plays Delbert Grady, a former hotel caretaker with a grisly past that haunts the hotel. Another achievement by Stanley Kubrick whose brilliance is as fetching as the massive rooms of the hotel. Maddening performance by Nicholson whose caretaker absorbs the hotel in a frozen frenzy. Duvall is excellent as a mother bent on protecting her child. Lloyd uses brains in outwitting his father in the massive hedge maze. Themes of domestic abuse referencing fairy tales and places where the mind and body cease to leave. Score: 9 / 10",

335,28 May 2021,DrPhibes1964,5, Vastly overrated,"I will never understand the fanatical fanbase behind The Shining. I didn't have the opportunity to see it on its initial release in 1980 and had to wait until it aired on a cable movie channel perhaps a year later. I had read and was a great admirer of the Stephen King novel and was very eager to see how it would be translated into a film. My initial reaction was disappointment and boredom. I have watched it numerous times over the decades but my overall impression has changed very little. Since that time I had seen all of Stanley Kubrick's films and had a marginal understanding of his style: cold, analytical, and satirical. One needs to watch a Kubrick film in a different way than other films,especially when it comes to how he has his characters ""behave"". It is never natural and oftentimes very exaggerated to the point of being silly. It works in films like Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange but it is very distracting in The Shining. Nicholson is the worst offender, but I don't know who to blame. Kubrick likes his actors to embellish the performances and he would then build from there, keeping what he liked and discard everything else. But Nicholson is not just chewing the scenery but devouring it, mugging and hamming it up. I've never thought he was a particularly great actor and he seemed to play a variation of the same character in film after film, turning it up or down as required.",

If you had read the book, you would see how glossed over the character Jack Torrance is in the movie. If there were just a couple very short flash back scenes of him as a teacher, an alcoholic with his buddy who got him the job at the Overlook, and the outburst he had with his son that lead to his broken arm, it would have developed Jack Nicholson's portrayal so much better.

Endless throngs of critics have spent page after page after page poring over every minute of every one of his films, scrutinizing every frame for possible nuances of meaning that Kubrick subtly worked into the film. Most critics, when reviewing any Kubrick film, hardly ever mention the actors' performances, all they talk about is Kubrick, and how every nose twitch that every actor made was cunningly crafted by the director, and communicates volumes. If an actor gives a bad performance in a Kubrick film, it's the actor's fault. If they give a good performance, it's the director's doing.",

354,28 July 2017,Horst_In_Translation,8, Great fun watch,"""The Shining"" is a British/American movie from 1980, so this one is already over 35 years old and it is among the later career efforts by writer and director Stanley Kubrick, even if he lived on for a long time afterward still. It is based on a novel by Stephen King who was only in his early 30s when this came out. There exist quite a lot versions of this film here and the one I watched is the one common here in Germany I believe, the one running for slightly under 115 minutes, one of the shorter I guess. Today the movie is considered among the modern (can you still call it that?) horror film classics, but there are a few factors that make it an unusual horror film I think. First of all, it is not too common to see really big-name actors in this genre, but lead actor Jack Nicholson was one of the biggest and most lauded performers in the industry back then. Also huge filmmaking legends like Kubrick weren't normally associated with the horror genre. I guess the exception proves the rule with this one.",

358,2 April 2016,sivadparks-89786,7, It's terrifying until you realize how ridiculous it is,"What is horror? When you're watching a movie you are not at physical risk. Surprise. The two ways you create horror is by putting in danger characters you care about or planting a story that you feel could happen to you. For me this did neither. The first half was absolutely terrifying. The camera work, creepy music and use of desolate rooms was very effective. Seeing Jack turn crazy is horrifying, especially since Jack Nicholson does creepy faces better than anyone. The problem is, they introduce the shining which is essentially paranormal and very poorly explained, two things that don't bode well. At first, the visions are creepy but as the movie progresses they just seem more and more ridiculous, particularly since they can actually move things. Again, the reason why isn't explained at all making this frustrating to watch if you haven't read the book. A lot of these are introduced but have no closure so I can't help but wonder why were they in there? Towards the end, Jack is hunting his son, which was terrifying, but then it cuts to Wendy seeing visions that were so cartoonish I laughed. Way to kill the suspense. there are three characters in this movie and the only one I cared about is the villain. Wendy and Danny were loathsome so at times I was rooting for Jack which should not be the goal of a horror movie. Also, Jack is constantly complaining about how much he works but we never see him work once. Not only does this devalue the character's arc but it also doesn't make sense. He was given several tasks that he never does but there is no apparent effect on the building which raises the question: Why is he needed there in the first place? Ultimately, this movie succeeded at being creepy for the majority of the movie, but it makes hardly any sense and several scenes kill the tension.",

369,4 November 2014,videorama-759-859391,8," I have a vision, a shining of a successful King novel to film","Every project Kubrick touches, turns to Gold. The guy was a legend, a directing god of cinema. What he's done here, transforming this Stephen King novel to film can is magic. A very little few King books, (I mean a very little few) make successful transitions to film, literally falling flat on their faces, forgettable pics, or ones that really stink, not how the novel intended. The Shining stands alone from all the other King books to film. Kubrick uses wide and low shots, making hallways seem mammoth as well as a hedged maze. Of course Nicholson, the stealer of the show is another reason to see it, less attractive in his hey day, but sells his role beautifully. We we never forget that connected corridor shot, two elevator in the background, where a violent wave or torrent of blood fills it up to capacity, where the screen quickly becomes one of full venesection. I really don't want to give away the story to this, as this is where the intrigue and fun of it is. After a cautious word, involving the original caretaker, O Grady responsible for the multiple slaying of his family, Jack starts changing for the much worse (talk about writer's block). Also he's having visions. Are they real or not? He is met by the notorious O Grady, and what's up with Jack's son, who has a sixth sense, and has been warned about Room 237. We know what curiosity did? Redrum = Murder. It's easy to work out the real answer when you think about it, which you will the full picture with the story here. I enjoy watching this film every time, the opening music score and wide shot of credits, as we track Jack's Vee dub, along a cliff top road is breathtaking, and watching Nicholson lose it, every time, is a pleasure much appreciated. The chalet itself used in the film is grand inside, as is the establishing shot too. The well acted movie has a lot of wonderful qualities.

This is good horror in all the right ways. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it's not the saw like gore that I was expecting but the movie does a good job through the 1st half of not throwing a bunch of scares at you but just makes you really uncomfortable which I love. However as soon as jack wields that axe it's spine tingling terror in the best way possible. Aside from Nicholson it loses a star for the acting not being the best. Danny's monotone acting can work especially when he is possessed by tony and the even Shelly Duvall has some shining (pun intended) moments but taking into consideration all the emotional abuse she went through it feels like almost a waste pulling off not a mediocre performance but not a great one either. Overall a great movie that will live on forever in infamy,

First things first; the direction that the genius Stanley Kubirk made was outstanding. He was looking for perfection an got very close to it. Then the performances that the actors made. Personally I think that Jack Nicholson's performance is one of the best I have ever seen. Now is not a secret how much Shelly Duvall suffered on set, but at the end the result makes it seem as if it all was really worth it. Along with the performances there was a little improvisation, phrases that have been quote till today and for eternity, those improvisations and their performances combined with the script and the direction is the result of an amazing piece if art. The production did a wonderful job. The film editing seems so simple, that for me that makes it look excellent, again, one of the best I have ever seen. All the psycho part was incredible.

The long gradual descent into semi-madness that makes the book memorable is completely missing. So, too, is the vivid description of the young boy as he gradually realizes the extent of his dilemma.

I get that the exposition has to be laid out but it really takes it out of me for the first 45 minutes. Although the second half blows the first half and most movies out of the water showing us that Jack is going insane and that hotel is the puppet master with little hints dropped here and their. That's what I like about this film more than the one that proceeds it. It isn't fully clear what is making the house haunted in a sense but that it just is.

387,4 May 2007,maiwol,10, The best horror movie of all time.,"Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way. Jack Torrance is a man in his forties, married, with one child, and with a past of trouble and alcoholism. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather, and there is a well-paid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months; and Torrance, who was looking to become a writer, found it perfect. But, the manager advised Torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that some caretaker in the past went crazy and murdered his family. Even before they got there, his son Danny, who has some sort of imaginary friend who illuminates him the future (shinning), knew the place wasn't good and didn't want to go. Once they installed themselves in the hotel, things started right but within a month, Jack began acting strange, irritated, and depressed. At this point, we know something is going to happen, but don't know when and how. Scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny, and someone who attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later on, Jack started to see other people and immediately felt good with them, like if they were his family; among them the famous psychotic caretaker, Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are ""intruders"" in the hotel. Obeying this order, Jack went for the objective and many of the most scary things I've ever seen happen here.

What I like about this horror is that Stanley Kubrick dared to use minimal amount of dark lit environment, compared to what almost all of the recent horrors are depending their scares upon. The repeated long shot on the corridors are very nice touches that help build curiosity. Those shots puts the object right on sight but with lacking clarity, sometimes prompting the viewers to slant their eyes to have better glimpse of what's being shown. The acting by Jack Nicholson deserves a legendary status indeed. His role gets into character very nicely that when it comes to the twist of the typed pages, even I was surprised, although I have been anticipating such a twist.",

410,24 June 2007,prehensel,10," A, um, Shining Example of the Horror Genre","What a terrific film. When you let Kubrick have his way with a story like this one, you can almost guarantee success. The book isif possibleeven scarier than the movie version because there's a frightening topiary scene and a scarier subplot that Kubrick didn't or couldn't explore. But the movie is still one of the best horror flicks ever made. I think it works so well because the Torrence family is so isolated. They are essentially beyond help once the snows come, and if you've ever traveled on mountain roads on which you may run into a forest service gate blocking the roads in the winter, you know what that isolation feels like. Go past that gate, and they may never find you. So I think that's what is effective in the original book, and Kubrick masterfully employs that theme throughout (isolation of the family from society, isolation of the family members from one another, and isolation of the individual). Between Danny on the tricycle, dead twins, bleeding hallways, a creepy dead bartender, one of the scariest still photographs ever, the decaying chick in the bathtub, Jack hacking through the bathroom door, Dick getting axed in the chest, Wendy seeing Jack's ""novel,"" and the final scene with him frozen in the maze, the film has more than its share of scary moments.

I remember seeing the famous scene when Jack was chasing his wife with the axe. At the time I was very impressed by it and remember being haunted by it a little. But it took me almost 25 years to actually watch the full movie as an adult. Before I watched it I was expecting a lot.

415,9 August 2001,MetalHorror,1," Awful adaptation of a terrific--and terrifying, let alone actually scary--book.","Stephen King felt pretty happy about the adaptations of his first two books, Carrie being mirrored perfectly by Sissy Spacek in De Palma's 1976 classic and 'salem's Lot being fairly okay on TV in Tobe Hooper's 1979 adaptation.  However, when Stanley Kubrick, one of the biggest and most famous directors ever, chose to adapt King's masterpiece of horror and great storytelling, Stephen King became cautious about who he chose to adapt and direct (not to mention how they are adapted and directed)--and with good reason.  Virtually the only things in common between the book and the movie are as such: character names and roles, the title itself, and locations.  All similarities end right there.  Though fans of Kubrick welcomed this so-called ""masterpiece"" into their already-huge cult of Kubrick movies, fans of the far larger Stephen King world--even after only 3 books at the time--were severely disappointed.  How could this movie be created?  The characters' attitudes are far different than in the book (Jack Nicholson is an average schmo to start and immediately becomes grouchy, then kookie; Shelly Duvall is an eccentric wife that acts as if she has suffered many years of abuse; not to mention Danny Lloyd's ridiculously ignorant and indifferent and jaded attitude that quickly turns to psychotic episodes).  Very bad acting goes into it all (virtually the only case of good acting that shows real characterization, however shallow, is Scatman Crothers as Dick Halloran), and the directing is terrible.  Over 12 obvious mistakes occur in this movie, including a clear shadow from the helicopter view of the Rocky Mountains at the beginning as well as a bending baseball bat used by Shelly Duvall on Jack Nicholson in one of many ridiculous conflicts and multiple parts of the door from the famous ""Here's Johnny!"" scene disappearing in several following scenes.  And to top it all off, Stanley Kubrick was so convinced that this...rubbish...was such a good movie that he had a contract made so that any re-makes of the movie could not be released on video in the US.  Luckily in 1997 a far more faithful adaptation was made, but unfortunately Mr. Kubrick's legacy of no-US-video had the movie appear only once on commercial television, never to be seen again unless it is on the video available overseas from Amazon.co.uk.  This was a terrible scratch in the long film reel of cinema history, and hopefully will be mended & forgotten soon enough.  All in all and simply put: this movie sucked. --MetalHorror",

But the best has to be when Wendy Torrance finally sees the manuscript her husband has been working on for who knows how many months, and she is forced to realize that her husband Jack is as crazy as a bedbug. And then he comes up behind her and says, ""How do you like it?"" Nobody plays crazy as well as Jack Nicholson, but I think his flamboyant portrayal has overshadowed Shelley Duvall's excellent characterization of Wendy Torrance, a somewhat dull-witted mother who nonetheless is fiercely protective of her child. It's a truly great performance.",

Yes, Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance is amazing, and his descent into madness is one of the most interesting parts of the film, but... How could anyone sympathize with him? Or Danny? Or Wendy? In the novel, you understand what motivates each of these characters. In the film, you're just expected to accept them doing what they do as they do it. I can give Kubrick that he didn't have a whole lot of time for characterization if he wanted to add in all he did, but I'd have liked to see more, which is rare for me after watching a two and one-half hour movie.

""Misery"", ""The Shawshank Redemptione"", ""The Green Mile"", ""Carrie"", ""Secret Window"" and others are also great but we have to consider that this is one of the first 'King' movies. Back in 1980. one very special director managed to make one very special movie. Of course I'm talking about Stanley Kubrick and ""The Shining"". Kubrick managed to create fear that book has (brilliant scenes when Danny is riding his bike through the empty hotel and that sound of wheels). He managed to make the atmosphere and he scared us all. His camera is great and this movie is a result of his genius. Music is creepy, Danny's imaginary voice is creepy (Tony), Overlook Hotel is creepy and Jack Nicholson is the king of creepiness. He is perfect for the role of Jack Torrance. With his crazy eyes, attitude and personality, he makes brilliant portrait of a man who gets insane as the time passes. I don't like Shelley Duvall but I have to admit she was good. She was very convincing and she behaved like every ordinary person, in her position, would behave. All my compliments goes to Danny Lloyd too, cause he was very young and yet he acted so well. To all you horror lovers and to all movie lovers. This one is for you.

The score to this film, by Bela Bartok, is simply hypnotic. There is also great cinematography from John Alcott. Kubricks' films are always hard to forget, but this film also has a hard to forget performance from Jack Nicholson. Nicholson holds the picture together in a lot of respects, as he goes crazy, the audience begins to see his dementia as well. I've heard Stephen King didn't really like this version of his novel.

For some reason, those 2 movies grabbed my attention from the start and never let go. But everything else he directed is a mixed bag for me. THE SHINING (1980) is an interesting film for me because my sentiments about it really mimic the original lukewarm reception back in 1980, but that opinion changed ever time as the film gained a ton of retroactively and not only does it fall under the ""cult classic"" tag, it's also somehow considered a masterpiece of cinema. Stephen King notoriously hates Kubrick's adaptation for straying too far away from the book. Personally, I couldn't care less and just want to be entertained. Horror has become my favorite film genre, but The Shining isn't even in the vicinity of what I consider to be the best or even my favorite horror movies. Top tier all-time horror films for me are Psycho, The Conjuring, Saw and even multi-genre classics like Jaws and The Terminator have a huge horror vibe to them. And on top of that, I'll take an entertaining, mindless 90-minute teen slasher movie over this slow, plodding, pretentious flick that is The Shining. The movie is so long and it feels like a lot of filler of scenes of nothing happening, just random shots of ghosts, hallways, blood, and gore.

449,26 July 2003,WriterDave,10, Kubrick Lite still Makes for One of the Best Horror Movies Ever,"When you compare this film adaptation of King's hack novel to other films from Kubrick (""2001"" or ""Clockwork Orange""), there really isn't much depth here.  The stuff is pretty straight forward.  Family shacks up at haunted hotel and dad goes nuts and tries to ax everyone.  Still it's pretty damn scary because Kubrick films it like a work of art (the aerial shots of mountains and the Overlook are haunting to say the least, as are the creepy interior shots of the hotel), and he sets the mood so well (there's an underlying sense of doom sleeping beneath the slow pace and cold feel to the film).  This film has aged very well, and is often sighted by fans and critics alike as one of the best horror movies ever made (even if it is Kubrick's slightest film).  The reason I think it has held up so well over time is because it can be watched on two levels.  You can take it all very seriously and creep yourself out big time, or you can enjoy it tongue-in-cheek and howl over Nicholson's over the top performance, Shelley Duval's incompetent whining, and the flat out weirdness of it all (dead old naked lady laughing in bathtub, blood flooding out of elevators, a little boy driving a Big Wheel down the haunted halls of the Overlook).  Let it give you nightmares, and then get your revenge by playing a drinking game to it the next time you watch it.",

I don't know what it was, it didn't feel like Jack was being possessed; It just looked like he was mentally insane which is the main reason I didn't his character.

Watching ""The Shining"" is a very intense movie experience, much like watching ""The Exorcist"". The brilliant music, the direction, the acting and the camera angles adds up to a very strange and disturbing movie indeed.

462,6 July 2016,the_professor530,10, A masterpiece of terror/cinema art.,"What makes The Shining so good? Is it the acting? The music? The cinematography? The lighting? The set? All of the above. Horror can be a tough genre to judge because does a horror film have to scare you to be successful? And how do you know if you were truly scared or not? If you jump during a scene, does that make the movie scary and therefore successful? Or is the movie scary and therefore successful because you are thinking about it later and feeling a sense of uneasiness? The Shining fits more with the latter category of horror films. It's not a movie that will likely cause you to jump out of your seat with fear. It might not even cause you to lose sleep or feel a sense of fear when thinking about it later. However, it does make one think. Things like when did Jack start to go mental, did Danny have any part in that, why didn't the chef want to talk about room 237, why did the hotel staff leave a family there over the winter knowing what could possibly happen, and did Jack really exist in that photo from the 1920s? These are all unsettling questions you'll be asking yourself after watching The Shining. One of the major aspects that creates the horrific feel of this movie is without a doubt the music. During the most intense scenes, the music only adds to the hysteria unfolding. When Danny sees the girls, when Jack gets angry with Wendy for the first time, when Jack and Danny are talking about the hotel in the room, when Wendy discovers what Jack has really been typing, when Jack is breaking down the door with an axe, and of course when he's chasing Danny through the maze. The music in these scenes, reminiscent of Psycho or Jaws, is almost a character itself. The actual characters themselves were played with such conviction that sometimes it didn't really feel like they were acting. Jack Nicholson didn't really do anything different from what he normally does. He's known for being an actor slightly unhinged. I mean he played The Joker in Tim Burton's 1989 movie Batman and was a patient at mental hospital in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It was natural that he play an author losing his mind inside a haunted hotel. Shelley Duvall has a stressed out and abused look to her, as if she's constantly fretting about her husband's alcohol problem, money, and food. She's the battered housewife who is soft spoken, meek and she smokes. Danny Lloyd's face said it all. His reactions to the horrific scenes he witnessed were spectacular, and made you sense the fear he was feeling. The cinematography of this film is excellent as well. How the camera follows Danny on his tricycle as he goes through the vast hotel, following Jack through the wintery hedge mazeit was a masterful achievement.",

The father is a writer and tries to finish his work during the stay. The son has something special gift which is called shining; he perceives spiritual things. They enjoy the stay at first, but gradually the father goes mad. It's related to the miserable murder happened at the hotel before. I'm sure that no one could act the madness except for Jack Nicholson. Just small his behavior makes us scared. This is the deferent point from other horror movies in America. Kubrick creates the best madness without monsters and zombies. Also I guess this film has similar but different atmosphere from J horror films. We can see both of them show human's or ghost's curse, but in this film something beyond the curse is described and Jack Nicholson creates that point. We see the madness, but does it come from only the apparition of the hotel? Is there no relation to his loneliness or pain?",
471,4 August 1998,cuz,10, Much-maligned but still a great horror film,"First of all, I loved the book. It remains my favorite Stephen King novel. Secondly, the TV adaption was well done. Still, I think Kubrick did a great job at creating the atmopshere necessary for a good, scary movie. It's full of incredible visuals, and great tracking shots (especially when we follow Danny riding on his big wheel through the hotel hallways). Sure, Nicholson gives an over-the-top performance but...that's what he does in almost every movie he's in. Have you ever heard of him giving a ""restrained"" performance? Shelley Duvall is okay. Actually, Rebecca DeMornay was a big improvement in the TV movie. I know King fans who absolutely hate this movie. They say Kubrick changed too many plot points and ruined the whole thing. I say there's more than one way to tell a good story. King did it very well, and so did Kubrick...just in a different way. I'd rank The Shining up there with the best horror films of all time, along side ""The Bride of Frankenstein"", ""Psycho"", and ""The Exorcist"", among others. It actually reminds me of another superb haunted house movie: ""The Haunting"", from the early '60s. Both movies create that sense of isolation; the fear of turning the next corner or opening the door everyone is afraid to open. It's also the best King adaption, although ""Stand By Me"", ""Misery"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" are close behind. If you haven't seen it, rent it. If you're one of those angry King fans, give it a second chance. It's worth it.",
472,18 March 2010,mnpollio,7," Atmospheric, but overrated thriller","Arguably one of the most loved/loathed ""haunted house"" thrillers ever. Stanley Kubrick/Jack Nicholson fans cannot seem to praise it enough, while fans of Stephen King's legendary novel are decidedly more lukewarm towards it. Personally I find the film rather schizophrenic, which leaves me somewhere in the middle. Anyone hoping to see even a marginally faithful adaptation of the King novel will be sorely disappointed as aside from the very bare bones of the story, many of King's memorable set pieces and much of the emotional pull of his story has been abandoned. Aspiring writer Jack Torrance and family are hired on to become caretakers of the oppressive Overlook Hotel during its off season in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains. Despite the threat of isolation and stories of a prior caretaker who went mad and murdered his family, the Torrances persevere and find out that the hotel has some rather nasty spooks determined to set Jack against his wife and son. Director Kubrick provides a chilling and ominous atmosphere thanks to hypnotic cinematography and amazing sets. The corridors of the hotel seem to go on forever. The film has its decidedly chilling moments – particularly the appearances of murdered twins, Nicholson's ax-wielding attack on wife Shelley Duvall and a memorable chase through a wintry labyrinth. Unfortunately, it has some glaring problems narratively and with its lead performance that cannot be overlooked. The title of the film is the slang term given to a psychic power possessed by both Danny Lloyd as the son and Scatman Crothers, as a hotel chef. In the King novel, the power was a major player in the story. In the film, both Danny and his power seem an afterthought and the hotel – which was decidedly malevolent in King's story – comes across as rather a neutral entity that just houses nasty specters. Danny's primal fear that his father will turn into a monster that will murder he and his mother is oddly muted in the film – largely because Kubrick treats the characters and their emotional plight as of little consequence and is much more concerned with setting the stage for Nicholson to enact his raving madman performance. Sadly, Nicholson's much-ballyhooed central performance nearly derails the film. At no point does anyone buy him as a caring husband/father who makes a shocking transition into a psycho. Instead, Nicholson plays him from the outset as a creepy nut with pedophile mannerisms to such an extent, that it becomes impossible to believe that anyone would follow him into another room much less into a 3-month isolation with a young child. While Lloyd is largely relegated to prop status speaking in a strange voice and drooling, Nicholson stomps and chomps the scenery sputtering, snarling, and hissing in between inappropriate one-liners. There is no doubt that his madman act is impressive, but it is also one-note and robs his character of any sympathy. Seriously, from frame one there is not one moment where he seems relatively normal and there is no moment where he shows any reluctance in his descent into madness. This film also serves the dubious distinction of marking when Nicholson's performances segued from real acting into caricature until About Schmidt came to the rescue. By contrast, it is not until reflection that one realizes Duvall, as his terrified wife, has delivered the film's best performance and shown him up. Additionally, the final shot of the film, which is apparently supposed to be a surprise, is anything but, indicating that Kubrick and his writers are not overly familiar with horror genres conventions. Yet for all its faults, the atmosphere and lavishness provided by Kubrick is a definite must-see in that few subsequent thrillers have been able to compete with it and he does provide moments they stay with you, even if the end product is not as impressive as some of its parts.",

I used to hate this movie as I felt it was boring and had no payoff. I still stand by that some what, but I no understand why it's so ""boring"". It isn't boring, but it is a study in slow burning terror as we watch Jack as he slowly spirals into madness. This is a great concept and is executed greatly by the book, which is much better than it in my opinion. In this film he seems crazy from the start. The ending also isn't as satisfying in my opinion and instead of the hotel blowing up Jack freezes to death. I can't help but feel I'm missing something.

To be fair, it's not hard to see why. There are considerable differences between the source material and the film and King didn't like how Jack wasn't as developed as he was in the original novel, and less sympathetic.

The background score, camera angles and cinematography are fantastic and provide an intense feel to the film. It succeeds in all the technical aspects but completely lacks in story and screenplay. On the outset it appears to be a psychological horror movie but is completely hollow in plot. The first half is really slow. The only saving grace, again is it's cinematography. Just nothing major happens in the first half. No character development whatsoever. They do not show instances in Nicolson's characters life that causes him to become insane, which is the most crucial aspect of any psychological film and especially in a film like this. They in fact just choose to show a 'nothing happens' first half and then him horrifying his wife and child in the second. At least some sort of back story damn it.

Yes, Jack Nicholson was wonderful in the leading role, he just seemed like a normal father and husband. Shelley Duvall is good too, why she was nominated for a Razzie I will never know. She engaged very well with Nicholson and handled the intense scenes realistically. The writing works pretty well, especially the dialogue between Duvall and Nicholson, when his character begins to go mad and get violent, that's when the best acting and writing is. The filming and scenery is great, I loved the opening shots, and the eerie score makes it one hundred percent better. The music is great here, it has a very creepy/eerie feeling to it. Little Danny is great too, especially for the age he was when this was made. Kubrick is a masterful director and he does so well with this movie, he knows how to film it in just the right way to ensure a scary effect. The bathtub scene is one of the creepiest and best scene in the whole movie. The full frontal nudity was necessary for the scene, hardly ever is full frontal nudity in a movie, but it is for this one, when she turns into an old creepy deformed woman it has the perfect effect! And of course the CLASSIC here's Johnny scene is wonderfully done. From jacks mad as hell behavior to Shelley's wonderful scared out of her wits reaction. All in all an interesting film that's definitely worth a watch. A very thought provoking ending too, leaves the viewer with questions. Have to watch to find out what i mean ;).

480,9 December 2014,trublu215,10, Ranks among the best horror films ever made,"The Shining is Stanley Kubrick's epic attempt at surreal horror and his achievement stands as not only a magnificent film but as one of the best films ever made. Starring Jack Nicholson, in what seems to be his most notable role, and Shelley DuVall, this film is the definition of creepy. The use of the tracking shots, the use of Kubrick's trademarks, everything about this film is damn near perfect. Telling the tale of Jack Torrence, an angst ridden author in need of some serious down time takes a job watching over a Colorado hotel for its off season. As the season progresses, Jack's cabin fever becomes the center point of his descent into madness. The reason this film is as scary as it is, is Kubrick's style. Without it, this would be your average run-of-the- mill haunted house story. Kubrick's intense dedication to his process along with the caliber of acting that he managed to bring to the screen time and time again, it makes for a truly unnerving and deeply disturbing look at what the fall of man looks like, mentally and physically.

493,7 November 2005,jboothmillard,9, The Shining,"From director Stanley Kubrick (Spartacus, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket), this is probably the best known and most admired adaptation of a Stephen King novel. Basically, aspiring writer, husband and father Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) has been interviewed and hired for the job of winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel. In the secluded Colorado mountains, the hotel is built over an ancient Indian burial ground. The hotel manager Stuart Ullman (Barry Nelson) warns Jack of the previous tragedy, that the previous caretaker murdered his family with an axe before shooting himself, but Jack is unphased. Jack brings his family, wife and mother Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd), to the hotel. There, one by one, they experience the hotel's dark past with a series of apparitions, hallucinations and time-warps. Danny is confirmed to have ""The Shining"" (telepathic abilities) by hotel cook Dick Hallorann (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest's Scatman Crothers). He sees the ghosts and bodies of the caretaker's murdered identical twin daughters (Lisa and Louise Burns), and a tidal wave of blood. Jack meanwhile has his mentality deteriorating, having writer's block, and nightmares when he does sleep. Wendy is shocked after Danny has been injured, she says the Danny entered room 23 and was strangled by a woman in the room. Jack investigates, and hallucinates a naked woman in the bath (Lia Beldam), and when she steps out they kiss. Moments later, she turns into a hideous naked old woman (Billie Gibson), and he walks out in terror. While hallucinating, he speaks to Lloyd the Bartender (Joe Turkel) in the Gold Room. Jack also has a hallucination of a ball taking place in the Gold Room, where a number of other ghosts appear. The ghost of butler Delbert Grady (Philip Stone) is part of an evil and spiritual presence influencing him he should ""correct"" his family, meaning to kill them. One day, Wendy looks at Jack's manuscript, and realises Jack is insane seeing that on every page he has written the same sentence over and over again, ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"". Jack threatens Wendy, and she bashes him on the head with a baseball bat. He tumbles down the stairs, injuring his ankle, and gets locked in the pantry. When Jack gets out, Danny is in a trance repeating and writing the word ""REDRUM"", in reverse that spells ""MURDER"". At that moment, Jack starts chopping through the door with an axe. Danny escapes through the bathroom window, while Wendy is trapped. Jack chops through the bathroom door and tries to unlock it, but is cut by the knife Wendy is holding. Hallorann is concerned for the family, after hearing about the severe snowstorm, and travels back to the hotel. He arrives at the hotel in a snowcat, and Jack ambushes and murders him in the lobby. Jack chases after Danny through the snow, into the large hedge maze, he loses him when Danny covers his tracks and escapes with Wendy. Jack collapses and freezes to death. The film ends with a photograph on the wall of the hotel's 1921 dinner party, with Jack in it! While this film is not very shocking, it is very chilling and disturbing, especially with the help of a fantastic performance from Nicholson, who is both fun and hammy as the disturbingly unhinged man driven to madness. His finest moment is of course chopping through the door, stopping to deliver the iconic (and ad-libbed) line, the introduction for Johnny Carson on ""The Tonight Show"", and number 68 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, ""Here's Johnny!"" Duvall is alright enough as the emotionally distraught wife and mother terrified of her insane husband. All shot with gliding Steadicam, making the never-ending hotel corridors very claustrophobic, with very good opening aerial scenes, and assisted with very screechy music by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind, this is a brilliantly disturbing horror film. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Director (why?!), and Worst Actress for Duvall (understandable in a way). Jack Nicholson was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, he was number 63 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 7 on The World's Greatest Actor, Jack Torrance was number 25 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 29 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments.

Honestly though ? It's bad and extremely overrated. No wonder Stephen King hates this film, I don't blame him. I hate it too. And by the looks of this review section, I'm not the only one that hates it (besides Stephen King). John ""Jack"" Torrance's character from the Novel is butchered in this film, Wendy Torrance is a complete joke compared to the Novel version of her..even Rebecca De Mornay is a much better and more book accurate Wendy Torrance in the freaking TV movie, ""The Shining"", Richard ""Dick"" Hallorann's character is a complete waste in this film and dies in this overrated pos movie unlike in the real MASTERPIECE, the Novel, where he survives. Danny Torrance talking to his finger and not seeing the older, grown up version of himself is also a waste and a total joke in this film. The only reason I gave it a 3 instead of a 1 is because Stanley Kubrick's unique and great filming is on display but unfortunately, Stanley Kubrick failed at everything else with this film. This film is not scary at all, it has pacing issues, hammy and bad performances from every actor and actress in the film except for Danny Lloyd who gave a solid and good acting performance for being so young. And for the topping on the cake, this film is also a terrible film adaptation of the far superior/better Novel. This film somehow, someway has an 8.4/10 rating. My God. LMAO. This extremely overrated film is nowhere close to the REAL big league films/Stephen King film adaptations like The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, especially The Shawshank Redemption. ""Stand By Me"" (""The Body"" is the book's title) is also a much better film and King movie adaptation and so is the film and Stephen King film adaptation, ""Misery"" ! Mary Lambert's and Stephen King's Pet Sematary 1989 film adaptation of Stephen King's ""Pet Sematary"" Novel is a far more scary and horrifying film than 1980's The Shining. Both films have hammy and bad acting from the lead actors and actresses but Pet Sematary to a far less degree and it's much scarier and a more horrifying film. So is Stephen King's IT..the 2017, 2019, and 1990 versions..all three versions..but the 2017 and 2019 versions of IT has great acting to go along with the great horror and scariness and creepiness.",

Dislike him or revere him, he is one of the finest directors of the 20th century. This film is probably his biggest undertaking. It may be appropriate to say that this is his biggest commercial success or his only commercial film. ""Clockwork' and ""2001"" did very well at the box offices, but they are hailed as critical and artistic pieces. This film is a horror film. No point in denying what it is. It falls into the category of the Jason's, the Michael Myers and the Freddy Kruger's. But...it also stands right next to the Damein's, the Exorcist's and the Serpent and the Rainbow's.

But I don't care because what makes a good novel and a good movie are two different things. The Shining is not a good movie, it's a GREAT movie! The film is the highest quality of cinematography, sets and acting. The Shining is a slow build of suspense and terror that does not get dilluted from repeated viewings. The score helps create a haunting melancholy moods and atmosphere that seeps into your subconscious with lush and disturbing visuals. This is a very effective psychological horror film that gets under your skin. All of the layers and elements come together beautifully by film master Stanley Kubrick and has Jack Nicholson's absolute finest performance, which is diabolically brilliant and absolutely convincing balls out performance of a mans sanity lost throughout the course of the movie. Shelly Duvall was brilliant as well and she plays of off Jack Nicholson perfectly.

""The Shining"" as a book is a masterpiece, probably the best King novel out there one can get if you would ask me. The film however suffers from, as more or less all films based on novels do, a lot of ""keys"" that I think is really important for the whole plot. I won't give any spoilers here, but Mr. Kubrick, whose works I adore, gives his own interpretation of the novel and he has a few tricks in his pocket for you here in case you believe that you've read the book and that'll leave you out of surprises - well you're wrong. Jack Nicholson (Jack Torrance in the film) makes a crazy performance here and if anyone should be closed within rubber walls, he's the person for it. He makes his role perfect and he succeeds in spreading psychotic vibes. I'd really like to make this a bit of critical spoiler, but I won't, so I sum things up with that I recommend reading the book before seeing the film. Yes, the film is a classic and I like it for sure, but so is also the book who I love. Kubrick's done as well as he possibly could I believe, it is hard to squeeze these 500 pages into 140 minutes without having to cut much of the plot or reorganize things, so this is a masterpiece itself (but once again, so is also the book). 7/10.",

Kubrick had a reputation for being a director with a unique vision. Many of his films had aesthetically pleasing visuals and shots that were hard to find amateurish. He was after all a photographer before a filmmaker, which helped give him that edge. When it came to stories, another person who was constantly sought after to get permission for their works was Stephen King. Although King was not in the Hollywood business full time as other people, what he did provide were foundations to creating new horror films. Since its release, Kubrick's interpretation of Stephen King's The Shining text was widely praised for how intense the viewing experience was. Since then, much of the crew members have surfaced and spoke about the film and the level of involvement Kubrick demanded. Oddly enough, King wasn't that impressed with it.

541,11 July 2017,theVade,10, The only shining star in list of duds.,"The Shining was a fantastic horror film from Kubrick, if not one of the best films in its genre. The Shining has almost everything going for it, great cinematography, great sound design, great suspense, great characters, with the only negative being (personally) an anticlimactic ending. But in the end I decided to give The Shining ""Straight V's"" on theVade Review Bar or a 10 out of 10. Not only is this one of the best horror films I've ever seen, but it is also one of the best films I've ever seen, and that is why I decided to give The Shining The Golden V. So congrats Kubrick, you've made a fantastic film. Too bad it's the only shining star in list of duds.",
542,23 November 2017,bankofmarquis,10, A masterpiece,My 20 year old son and I stumbled across a classic film yesterday.  He hadn't seen it and I hadn't watched it on over 25 years.  So (instead of watching it edited and with commercials) we pulled out our BluRay copy and sat down and watched Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING.,
543,24 February 2008,emperor_bender,10, Probably the best Stephen King film,"Where to begin... This movie was 100% perfect. The actors, storyline, atmosphere, everything. Jack Nicholson gives what I believe is one of his best performances here as Jack Torrence, the estranged, alienated father of the Torrence family. Shelly Duvall gives another great performance here as Weny Torrence, Jack's stressed out wife and Danny's mother. I often wonder how her character was able to take so much mental abuse throughout the film but she somehow managed to. The scares in this movie were many and great. They made you not want to go to a fancy hotel for a while after watching this movie. This film felt like The Thing in parts, people trapped in a vast alienated place trapped in by snow and extreme weather, but at the same time was different because of the haunting. Some scenes were shocking, others very disturbing, all of them 100% eerie. This film is a classic and always will be. Horror fans should check this out if they have not already. 10/10.",

'The Shining' is a Kubrick film through and through even though it is based on a Stephen King novel, who himself has a singular, unique voice. Visually, the film has all the Kubrickian elements like the use of wide angle lenses, the use of deep focus, the use of one point perspective, the extensive use of tracking shots, characters doing the Kubrick stare, precise use of the zoom, etc. Particularly the score in the film By Wendy Carlos is just phenomenal. The music and the score is essential and indispensable in creating the dread that Kubrick is looking for. But tonally too, the film has Kubrick written all over it, since unlike King's novel, the movie is relentlessly inhuman and pessimistic.",

The Shining is a master film. I don't believe it's perfect. I have not read the book, so I cannot comment on differences with the film.

He said he will do anything for the son, but he just let those ""ghost"" control him and hurt his son and wife. And then the rest of the movie just a crazy guy how to kill his wife.

576,14 May 2008,trix_n_min,5," Scary, Yes, But Not Coherent","I only recently saw The Shining for the first time and I have to say I was quite disappointed. While the performances by the actors are fantastic, and Nicholson plays a fantastic lunatic, I found the movie to be in-cohesive and to lack structure. Maybe it is necessary to read the book first to understand everything in the film, maybe not. Not having read the book, however, I found the movie full of loose ends that were never tied up. On a positive note, the film was sufficiently scary, I did find the suspense/thriller aspect of it very well done, and the scene with the blood spilling was very clever and disturbing. However, I found there was no explanation for many things. Danny's ""Shining"" ability seems pointless in the film. He sees things that we already know happened, he has this ability that doesn't help him in any way. His father still goes mad, and it is his mother's resourcefulness that saves them, not his ability. All his special talent does is make the kid a little scary, especially in the ""redrum"" scene. Apart from making him creepy, I don't think his ""gift"" serves any purpose in the film. It summons Halloran, and this part is built up and up with him coming to the rescue, and he is butchered before anything even remotely interesting happens, thus making his and Danny's ability an utter waste of time. The scene with the woman in the bathtub is gross, true, but pointless. It shows nothing. And the ending is very drawn out. When the film finally does conclude, and I was waiting for all these loose ends to be tied up, that photograph is shown of Jack in the past, confusing me ten times more and leaving the storyline completely open for interpretation. ""You've always been here"" is what he is told, and we see that, so what the heck was happening in the mean time, with Grady, with Jack's wife and son, with Halloran (didn't he know Jack was already caretaker?)... Nothing is answered, nothing is concluded, I found the ending really frustrating and disappointing. If this film was meant to be only a frightening thriller, then it has achieved its purpose. But if it was meant to be clever and cunning and show some hidden meanings, then it fails dismally. Good cast, good thrills, crappy structure, very stupid ending. I'll try my luck at the book and hope it is more satisfying.",
577,9 November 2019,martin-intercultural,9, Timeless,"A richly symbolic movie, yet its central theme of marital power struggles and the male ego is quite simple and universal. Also, the viewers' obsession with the darker layers of meaning - relating to childhood trauma, mental disassociation, demonic possession etc. - tend to obscure the pitch-perfect acting performances and the powerful projecting that is on display throughout the film. Dialog becomes superfluous; we can read in the actors' faces precisely what is unfolding, no matter how complex or conflicted their emotional state may be. A great, engrossing piece of cinema.",

Only few such films which are coming up to my mind right now are The Conjuring (2013), The Strangers (2008) and Jackals (2017).

The film was for the most part, excellent.
I believe the quality of the film absolutely lived up to the hype, it is a beautifully crafted piece of cinema.
I felt such a sense of impending doom and suspense throughout basically the entire film, right from the opening helicopter scenes.
I believe it is judged a little harshly as a ""horror"" film - psychological thriller I think would be a better fit.
That said though, I do think the storytelling lacked some very needed ties. There were lots of great elements in the film but nothing really brought them together, maybe I just didn't get it?

Be it sci-fi, historical drama, political satire, war movie, film noir, erotic mystery thriller, or - as in this case - horror. ""The Shining"" undoubtedly has a very firm Kubrick stamp on it and made Stephen King's material entirely his own, a fact that King didn't particularly like and thus had it remade for TV years later. While the TV version has some merits and follows the book more closely, the way it is it will always be compared to a master film maker's take on the material King provided and therefore doesn't stand a chance.

588,10 February 2012,BA_Harrison,9, It was snowing last night—perfect weather for The Shining.,"I often struggle with Jack Nicholson, finding his distinctive off-screen persona so evident in his acting that it's hard to for me to accept the bloke as anyone but himself. Occasionally, though, Nicholson's crazed appearance and unmistakable mannerisms are perfect for his role, adding credibility and weight to his performance; such is the case with The Shining, in which the actor plays writer Jack Torrance, who, under the influence of evil spirits, slowly turns from family man to murderous axe-wielding nut-job. Never has Jack's wicked grin been so perfectly suited to a character—not even for the Joker.",
589,22 April 2019,jmholmes-73727,10, MADNESS PURSUES AND CAPTURES JACK,"This is, perhaps, the ultimate psychological horror film. In it, Jack Torrance listens attentively to the hotel manager's tale of the previous winter caretaker's descent into homicidal mania. Already on shaky emotional ground himself, the story of his predecessor's tragedy functions as a hypnotic suggestion that takes root with a vengeance in his own vulnerable psyche. Two hours of movie-time later, his psychosis full blown, wielding an axe, he is hunting down his own wife and son through the deserted grounds of their isolated temporary home.
By narrowing the focus of King's novel, Kubrick heightens the terror. His use of music and dazzling photography, as well as a near total absence of darkness in the interior sets (everything is brightly lit
until we get outside in the final ten minutes) - create a texture that is entirely his own. My only problem lies in the last shot: of a black and white photograph

594,9 April 2020,bryancheong96,9, Greatest Horror Movie of the Century,"The Shining is easily one of my all-time favorite horror films, mainly because it doesn't rely on cheap jump-scares or gore/violence; the antagonist never physically hurts the characters on screen, only providing the mere (and very real) threat of violence toward the end. The film also does well by avoiding typical cinematographic tools of the genre: dark lighting, close-up shots, and fast jump cuts, all of which would play on the viewer's fear of the unknown, claustrophobia and anxiety. However, The Shining manages to provide all of these unnerving sensations in scores, despite doing the exact opposite of the typical horror genre, by portraying the Overlook Hotel as brightly as possible, using wide angle shots throughout the film, and by using long, lingering shots of the environment of the Hotel. Director Stanley Kubrick did a marvelous job of putting the viewers at unease by showing the vast expanses of the Hotel in full lighting, assuring the audience that our protagonists are truly alone in the Hotel - until they are not. He also puts sharp, jarring noises (usually reserved for scenes where the killer is lurking in the dark, or when the monster moves past outside the window) throughout the Shining, even when nothing of significance is happening, further playing on the audience's anxiety and keeping them engaged thinking something could happen at any time - although mostly it doesn't, but it still worked in getting my palms perspiring. The Shining is unique in this sense, that it provides some of the most unnerving cinematic experiences in history, and leaves the viewer absolutely terrified and not able to answer why. For these reasons, The Shining gets a 9/10 from me.",

This thriller is subtle and nearly misleading as we open. Long shots of open highways winding through incredibly beautiful scenery, incredibly appointed rooms with lush beauty, and some small background moments to give you a little insight into the characters. But once the preliminaries are over, the film begins to step up the pace. Little Danny is having visions, as is Jack, and the characters are portrayed like all the characters in King's books...unremarkable until affected by the evil that is the Overlook. Nicholson is incredibly powerful as Torrance, a man with little moral background, a recovering alcoholic and child abuser who has already injured his son. Slowly but surely he is drawn into the Overlooks plans through the manipulations of Lloyd the Bartender, exceptionally portrayed by Joe Turkel. While Shelly Duvall's character is two dimensional and somewhat weak, she nonetheless manages to pick up the gauntlet of the challenge and we witness a transformation from the weak-willed, battered wife to a mother intent on saving her child. While the MPAA did not have the rating system in place at the time, this film would be an should be rated R for language, brief nudity, and scenes of horror and violence.

600,6 November 2016,cahill-64801,10, Favorite Horror/Psychological Thriller Ever Made.,"The Shining is absolutely a must watch for anyone who considers themselves as a movie lover, or simply anyone who wants to watch a movie that will leave them unsettled and jolted. From the very beginning of the movie, there is a tension felt that is rather hard to describe. The viewer knows that there is a maleficent presence at the cabin as soon as they spend a few minutes there, yet it is very difficult to describe what will happen to the family as they spend their time there or exactly what is so unsettling about the house. The movie is the culmination of the brilliant writing of King, the detail- oriented directing of Kubrick, and the convincing performance of Nicholson, and it is exactly as satisfying as one would think it would be. The rising level of uneasiness is hard to ignore as the film progresses, and the way the movie is filmed and the scenes are set will unease the viewer time and time again. Despite the psychologically disturbing nature of the film, it is very easy to watch and quite entertaining. This is my favorite horror movie because the acting and the plot are absolutely quality. It does not rely on quick jump scares or commonly done tricks, but rather a deeply thought out enemy that is complex enough to demand multiple viewings.",

602,12 May 2014,willgrant952,10, Best King adaption ever!!!,"Kubrick nails it again with this adaption of Stephen King's boring novel. King is a great idea man, but his writing style is a bit droll. Luckily Kubrick took the best elements and made it his own. The Shining is a horror masterpiece, right up there with John Carpenter's The Thing and Nightmare on Elm Street. The music and cinematography are hypnotizing and Jack's performance is a tour de force. There is few horror films that feel this epic. It's a classic in the truest sense if the word. It's gotten better over time and the creep factor remains strong. I try and watch this every Halloween (along with the movie Halloween). I wish there was a way to view the 144 minute version- so curious as to what was cut out. So for you horror fans out there, this is mandatory viewing.",
603,22 November 2015,echoes-31277,10, Perfect leaving aside some genre confusions.,"Forget the confusion part 10 is not enough for this movie. If i can i would rate it a 100 considering Jack Nicholson's performance which is outstanding. The movie is based on the story but however some scenes are made up. Like Wendy was actually a blonde and Jack's encounter with the evil forces was a gradual process. The movie is arranged in a way which glues the viewer wondering what will happen next. In my opinion , however the role of Jack Torrance seems humorous that this movie confused me that is this really a horror film? So many comedy elements and I was shocked that it was not in the comedy genre along with horror. Like the part Jack comes with the axe seemed actually funny and also the way he talks to Wendy when she finds out what he had been typing. All my little cousins found this movie (forget some scary parts) to be actually funny . The Loyd scene was ironic that it will always be one of my favorite scenes. Finally this movie could have been made much more thrilling to the viewers if the roles were well played and the plot was followed properly. To me Jack seemed quite funny. Not quite but very funny. Even due to this confusion I give this a 10 because it was a joy to watch due to Jack Nicholson's performance keeping aside the genre part.",

Mainly through cinematography, but also using an ingenious score, he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start. It really is this flawless ambiance that makes The Shining the masterpiece that it is. Of course it doesn't hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. A frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad. A lot of people complain that the casting of Nicholson makes Torrance appear insane before the hotel gets it's hold on him, but the full circle ending makes this perfect in my eyes. Kubrick creates a plethora of the most memorable horror sequences in film history, from a man in an animal suit giving fellatio to the infamous bloody sisters.

During his stay with his wife and his son, Danny, Jack begins to feel a sinister atmosphere. Danny starts to have a series of disturbing visions and Jack's writer's block worsens. As a result, Jack goes on a murderous rampage, targeting his family. To start, the film is excessively long.

I think that is the best performance of her career so far. During the filming which they show a documentary after the movie on my tape, they show how Shelley was pushed so far. I guess it was easier in Kubrick's direction to make things rough for her to get the outcome he desperately wanted. Shelley forgave him because the outcome was worth the effort. Kubrick was not known for being a genius for nothing. He had scenes done over a couple hundred times just to get it right. But this film shot in England was worth the effort, Kubrick captured the story nearly perfectly although he altered the outcome slightly. Jack Nicholson might have won three Oscars for other movies but he'll always be remembered for saying ""Here's Johnny"" in a demented way. The kid who played Danny Torrance was perfect in the role. I love the imagery and visual art direction that the film provided. I also loved Scatman Crowthers as Danny's friend and the cook. There are few horror films that I watch over and over but this is one because I liked the characters, the story, and the supernaturalness around the hotel.

610,3 November 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,9," How'd you like some ice cream, doc?","There's perhaps no horror film more enduring than Kubrick's 'The Shining (1980)', an enigmatic and unsettling piece still debated to this day. Its reputation is, in my option, wholly deserved. It's easily one of the best in its genre, a genuinely masterful affair that's as creepy as it is compelling. Every inch of it oozes with unease, from the sets to the soundtrack to the stars. Indeed, Nicholson is as phenomenal as everyone says, veritably terrifying from the moment he appears. He goes big, he goes small, he goes exactly where he needs to. He is perhaps the definitive antagonist, given as much time as he needs to evolve into the axe-wielding maniac we all know and, ostensibly, love. The picture's protagonist is perhaps given less time but he's equally as engaging, plagued with visions of the past and premonitions of the future. His increasingly strung-out mother is great, too. Her exhausted anxiety is utterly gripping, a result apparently provoked by long and unkind shooting hours. Whether this sort of direction is worth its human cost is debatable yet, in a way, irrelevant; the on-screen results, which can't be altered now, speak for themselves. The thing is just so intriguing, chock full of mystifying moments and an ending that's, essentially, as ambiguous as possible. There's so much to ponder over after it's done. It's incredibly satisfying and, somehow, holistic. It's also brazenly unique, its horror coming not from the consequences of the supernatural but from the results of a psychological decline. Practically every scene is brilliant, every escalation heart-pounding. It's weird and wonderful. Most importantly, it's intangibly scary. There's nothing quite like it. 9/10",

The cinematography is very cinematic, including numerous tracking shots, making the film looks beautiful and makes the location seems more real. The performances are good for most of the cast but Jack Nicholson's performance is over the top, his performance could have been more restraint early on in the film. But it does make the film more entertaining and remember-able. Characters could have had more development to define the characters more; this could have made them more interesting. Also some back-story could have been used to define and to make them more interesting as well. Good dialogue that works in the film. A very intriguing plot that only gets better as the film goes on. I enjoy how the plot unfolds growing ever so creepy and unpredictable as the time goes on. Great unique visuals are used frequently giving the film a interesting look.

as i read i do believe the fact the director (Stanley Kubrick) was very cautious with the movie he just wanted to keep the movie as good as he wanted in his stylish because many things were changed and missing according to (Stephen King)s novel obviously he was against it as he says: (Stephen King) was quite disappointed in the final film. While admitting that Stanley Kubrick's visuals were stunning, he said that was surface and not substance. He often described the film as ""A fancy car without an engine.""), so is the shining really that horrific? No it's not that horrific it's actually more psychological that really stresses the viewer with it's simple scenes i believe how much simple the movie was but it's really stressful good job it's not relying on any jumpscares, another thing i liked most the soundtrack that just doesn't let you feel safe, i enjoyed every scene and second of the movie till the last minute, by the way i watched the (119 minutes) version that a lot of scenes were taken out i watched the deleted and cutted scenes on youtube i wish they weren't cutted out because they were very detailed, perhaps my thoughts would have been different if i watched this movie at it's time, highly recommended for a classic horror movie, 9/10⭐",

652,21 April 2012,gwnightscream,7, Good Horror Flick!,"Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall and Danny Lloyd star in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror film based on Stephen King's novel. Nicholson (Batman) plays Jack Torrance, a school teacher turned writer who becomes the caretaker of an old Colorado hotel, ""The Overlook"" located in the mountains. He takes his wife, Wendy (Duvall) and young son, Danny (Lloyd) there where they stay for the winter. Soon, strange things begin to happen as Jack tries to work on his book and becomes insane. Danny starts to have a psychic ability and sees strange visions learning the hotel is haunted. This is a good horror flick that's one of Jack's best and Wendy Carlos' score is eerie.

But it turned out the quiet opposite. I never felt it as a horror movie, all the actors acted very well but it was a totally slow with an unexpected tragic type of ending to the story for people who want to see a good horror mystery flick. I did not get why the movie ended in that manner, i went back saw the end again but still didn't get what the director or the writer wanted to show. If u r alone in house and want to see a horror movie for fun being never choose this.If u really want to see this then sit with the ones u hate most so u can irritate them. I was utterly disgusted by this movie. If this is supposedly the best of horror, I will never want to watch the horror genre again for fear of seeing its worst. the movie really stinks and i don't know why is it rated so much.",

There is absolutely nothing scary in this, and the story is SO boring. This is definitely the most boring movie I ever saw. I read the reviews, and the high ratings that had been given and watched this movie with great interest. What a waste of my precious time! Sleeping would've been better than watching this s*itty movie. Advice; this is NOT a 'Horror' movie at all. Don't waste your time watching this boring movie. I'm a fan of Jack Nicholson's great acting, and he does act amazingly in this. But the story is boring, total waste of time. Do NOT watch! I've never written a review on IMDb before. I was so irritated with this movie, so here goes my first review. Save yourself, get away from this movie!",
655,11 February 2008,funkyfry,8, A sense of failure,"Stanley Kubrick made one of his most commercial films based on this Stephen King story, and while it's not one of my favorite Kubrick films nor one of my favorite horror films I do think it's a very effective bit of cinema, and one that really used to chill me when I saw it as a kid. Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall are both great in my opinion, though Nicholson sometimes is a bit too over the top. I even noticed in one scene where he seemed to be channeling Bruce Dern because his psycho act looked basically the same as Dern's in various biker movies they made together. Duvall's taken a lot of heat for the movie, but frankly people should take note of the fact that Kubrick never got a great performance from any actress in any of his movies. Maybe a lot of the problem is with Kubrick is what I'm saying and not with Duvall. Her work in the film seems perfect to me -- in the beginning she's the very image of a co-dependent, making expert excuses for her husband's abuse of their son, and when Jack has his melt-down she goes into a very convincing ""mama bear"" mode protecting her son above herself.",

I've seen breakdowns of the film that range from it being a comment on alcoholism, family breakdown, American history regarding Native Americans, and even the gold standard. These are about sussing out patterns that require either very isolated readings of certain elements or the use of outside factors like Stephen King's novel in order to support.

Despite the fact that he has never really directed one, he was infatuated with the project. He read the novel by Stephen King and set out to recreate the novel, his own way. What we get is a cold ans sterile film that resembles the original source material some what. We get a maniacal and crazed Jack Nicholson, a doormat Shelly Duvall and a minor actor/performer Scatman Crothers a shot a some big time acting. The actors were ""motivated"" by the director's work but it just didn't work out as one might felt it should have.",

None of us have-- Kubrcik's THE SHINING has had a chokehold on movie lovers since it was re-evaluated in the late 1980s. Initially derided by Stephen King fans and film critics, it's gone on to become one of the most beloved of horror movies. Out of Kubrick's mature period, it's probably his most accessible work for a general audience: there's suspense, a lingering sense of creepiness, and enough dark comedy to keep the whole thing fun. In fact, this might be Kubrick's funniest movie right after DR. STRANGELOVE.",

I must have been thirteen or fourteen, and had just read Stephen King's novel. There was something cold and clinical about the film that really shook my spine; I could never quite put my finger on exactly why. Perhaps it was the drab colours, the detached camera-work, an overwhelming sense of apathy towards the characters' fate. Just recently, I took the opportunity to see 'The Shining' at the cinema (on a double-bill with 'A Clockwork Orange (1971)') and my appreciation for the film hasn't faded. An unhappily-married couple (Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall) are employed to caretake the Overlook Hotel over winter. As the long, bleak months progress, the Hotel's rich and dark history begins to manifest physically, and Jack's alcoholism and unstable psychological state begins to crumble into maniacal madness.",

667,9 May 1999,SlimeyPete,6," Brilliant, but has one HUGE flaw.","This is a superb film - the pacing and suspense are just right, and the shocks come thick and fast in the last 45 minutes. However, there is a big flaw: It is never properly explained exactly why the lead character goes psycho. In the book it is because he is a reformed alcoholic who's just had his first drink in three years, and the hotel he is taking care of is playing with his mind. In the film, we are given a slight hint that he used to be an alcoholic, but not enough. We are just left confused when he suddenly goes mad a while later. As I said, though, it's a thoroughly scary and entertaining film.",
668,17 May 2020,SoumikBanerjee1996,8, Classic Taste of Horror!,"Made in 80s, despite being 40 years old; it still gives tough competition to modern day and age horror movies. It was one of the those films that inspired the coming generations till date! And I can exactly see why! The direction is top notch, the camera work is phenomenal! Considering at that time they hadn't got the technological privileges like we do. Some shots, especially the long continuous ones were truly impressive! The sound score is most of the times kept on mute. Many interactions and scenes are being portrayed by their visual brilliance and it was up to the director and cinematographer to exhibit the essence of feel into those particular moments without getting help from sound tracks. Nowadays the formulas have drastically changed. The sound score plays a huge part now, especially in creating jump scares that not oftentimes work! This should be an example to those who calls out jump scares as the ultimate horror making formula. They need to see it in order to understand and believe that a horror film could succeed without keeping any sort of reliance into fake jump scares and loud sudden bursts of sounds!",

Yet, I think he has a pattern like many of his other films, that display his own ideas and his personality even when may not have wanted to display them. The shining has already been heavily critiqued and digested since it's inception, what I'll add is my personal opinion.",
671,24 October 2021,readyforchickenparty,9, Wouldn't say it's a masterpiece but still a great movie,What can I say that hasn't already been said? Shelley Duvall performance is amazing the child acting is amazing most of it it's amazing but just a little criticism to add to your mind. The shining the title of the movie but it isn't that important I actually think if you remove that from the story entirely it would've changed a thing it's established that the shining let you see ghosts but you know Jack and Wendy can also see them so it doesn't really have much of point you could also see the future but it's not like Danny uses that to his advantage later in the movie I think it would've been more interested if he did. Also Kubrick's jack is still really good performed brilliantly by Jack Nicholson but I feel like his character could've been a lot better if he was just betrayed like he was in the book now the book is 4.5/10 in my opinion but I feel like jack's character in the book is better than the one in the movie. Jack in the movie is a monster deep down inside but he doesn't show it or at least tries to the whole suspense of the movie is the audience waiting for him to finally snap but of the book Jack is a guy who is becoming a monster but he doesn't want to and tries his best to not want to kill his family so it's kind of the opposite of Kubrick's version but if the movie had this version of Jack I think it would've been a lot better and would've made when he finally snaps so much more terrifying. Overall I think this is a brilliant movie but you know it's not perfect nothing is perfect despite what I said about this movie I still love it.,

674,27 October 2002,jsoc42,3," A successful comedy, unfortunately by accident","I thought this was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, if only because of its absurdity.  Stanley Kubrick showed, as in 2001, that he can take a great story, and basically ruin it.  Critics applaud everything he does, only, in my opinion, out of respect for such magnificent efforts as Paths of Glory, Spartacus, Dr. Strangelove, and Full Metal Jacket.  He added so much pointless stuff to this story, that I had to stop taking it seriously.  I'd heard such great things about this movie, and I have applied my Taxi Driver theorem, named after Scorcese's Taxi Driver.  If a great director does a movie, and it's extremely odd, and has a lot of stupid, quirky, just plain weird things in it, the critics will applaud it's genius, out of a fear of being called stupid.  The critics were probably afraid to admit that they just plain don't understand the movie, so they praised it in a way calling anyone who doesn't understand it stupid.  Unfortunately, no one will admit when a great director makes a mistake, so this has gone down as one of the greatest horrors of all time.  I, personally, couldn't stop laughing the entire time.",

679,28 May 2001,dwpollar,7, Excellent portrayal of descent into madness by Nicholson in this Kubrick directed scary film...,"1st watched 5/28/2001 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Stanley Kubrick): Excellent portrayal of descent into madness by Nicholson in this Kubrick directed scary film based on a novel by Stephen King.  What seems to be lacking to make this a great film is some consistency in what was truly possessing Jack to do what he was doing.  We get clues that there was a murder in 1970 at the same hotel, and later that something similar must have happened around 1921 with the strange coincidence that the top dog of the hotel back then looked like Nicholson.  We also have a series of strange hallucinations seen thru the eyes of Shelley Duvall's character that lead us to believe the place has been haunted for awhile.  This type of uncertainty seems to prevail in many of Kubrick's movies so I guess I should have expected this, but it seems that more information(possibly in  King's novel) should have been included.  But as a scary movie, with a knockout performance by Nicholson, as well as most everyone involved,  there ain't too many pictures of this type that beat this.  Sometimes the way to determine whether a scary movie does it's job is if you don't want to watch the movie again -- which happened to me, so I guess Kubrick did what he intended.",

681,26 February 2008,drystyx,7," more assets than liabilities, a fun film","First, I'll try a synopsis of this movie. That isn't easy, because there are basically three points of view throughout. A writer takes a job overseeing a desolate hotel, which for some reason is completely isolated during the winter, with no one around. He, his beautiful wife, and his troubled young son are all alone in a haunted hotel. The people who leave him there seem to know it is haunted, too. The writer, we learn later, is trouble, too. The film is purposely ambiguous as to whether he arrived deranged, or whether the ghosts he meets drive him to insanity. Some will like the chilling scenes. It is a fun movie, and it is scary. Others will not like some of the ambiguity, nor the fact that the writer seems to go crazy all at once. However, a second look shows that he may not have come unhinged in one second. The tell tale scene is when his wife finds part of his manuscript to see what he has written. It denotes that he has been crazy for some time. The young son is trouble, but ""gifted"", with some ability to sense hauntings. For some reason, this makes him a sort of target. Why? Probably more for effect than actual cause. To accept the premise of the movie, you need to accept the premise that the ghosts are the result of some actual intelligence, and that this intelligence is some evil of the usual Hollywood undying evil sort. A lot of interesting scenes make this movie enjoyable enough. It has mixed reviews, but overall, it has many more assets than liabilities.",

In addition to the torment caused by ghosts throughout the film, the lighting allows Kubrick to masterfully develop Danny's personality and relationship with his parents, making his visions primary tools for much of the sensations Kubrick wants to convey to the viewer, also putting a lot of his own personality into the script and momentarily setting aside the original material by writer Stephen King, a fact that bothered the author a lot when checking out the film from his book.",
