2,26 March 2011,alexart-1,9, Our Love Became a Funeral Pyre,"When people watch the Oscars, they don't usually care about the Best Foreign Film nominees. Incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Incendies is the kind of film that one walks away from feeling emotionally drained, one where it stays in the viewer's mind for days on end. Like an intense personal experience, it takes a lot to come to grips with the film's story, a moving plot full of twists and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York, at which I saw this last night, Denis Villeneuve explained that he has made four films in Canada, but this is the first one to be released in America. Right now, I see no reason why Villeneuve, or any of the actors for that matter, shouldn't have a great future ahead of them.",e

It is ironic that one of the best films about the Middle East conflict, and specifically the tragic civil war in Lebanon, should be made by a Canadian film maker. Incendies is based on a play but it feels as though it has been adapted from a great literary work. In fact there is no specific mention of any country in the film but no one can be in any doubt that the unnamed country is Lebanon.",v

Check that, ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" was another film that served a solid punch to the gut that remains with you a long time. I have to credit some other reviewers for this film to identify the location of the story and place it in context of the Lebanese civil war. I might have considered it myself if I hadn't been so absorbed by the story and the intricately detailed revelations regarding Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal) and her twins, son Simon (Maxim Gaudette) and daughter Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin). One must pay attention though, to the non-linear story telling style of director Denis Villeneuve, as well as the identity of the Christian and Muslim factions involved in war time brutality and atrocity. Apart from the principal story, the scene that will stay with you for a long time involves a Christian militia attack on a busload of Muslims attempting to flee their war torn and devastated city. A noble sacrifice on Marwan's part turns into a horror spectacle when a young child is gunned down by the militants. The picture exemplifies the terror of war and it's heartbreaking effect on those fortunate to survive.",w

13,7 September 2019,andrewroy-04316,7," The build is tense and well crafted, but the twist is more shock value than adding depth to the story","There's no doubting Villeneuve's skill in building tension and emotional stakes through his characters and shots. While it's in a very different way, like in Enemy the shocking twist ending doesn't really add to the story and feels forced. The difference is while in Enemy the ending was insane and left the meaning and plot completely up in the air, in Incendies what happened is entirely clear and just isn't that satisfying. The most cogent point Villeneuve makes in the film is how the atrocities of war can shape people and turn them into monsters. The alternation between the past and present put into focus how war can ravage a region and a family for decades and was very effective in gradually unspooling the plot threads. The performances were all very good, particularly those playing Nawal and her daughter.",2

If one really wants to single out the most effective and compelling scene, that would be the massacre on the bus and subsequent shooting of the young child. It works because Director Denis Villenueve compounds the horror exponentially: the bus is stopped by terrorists, the passengers react confused and frightened, the bus driver is murdered, the terrorists strafe the bus with machine gun fire killing most of the passengers, Nawal (the protagonist) and a young mother and her young daughter move to the back as the terrorists pour gasoline on top of the roof of the bus, Nawal escapes and takes the young girl with her only to see the terrorists set the bus on fire killing the mother and finally the child running back to the bus to be with her mother, only to be shot in the back by the terrorists as Nawal watches in horror.",?

(Major Spoiler) I had an inkling that the filmmakers might pull what they ended up trying to smear on the viewer, and it was so, so disappointing. Suffice it to say to twist the plot around and pretzel it like they did, the filmmakers stooped to utter contrivance. They blew up logic and believability for the sake of sensationalism. How probable could all of this actually take place in such a sequence (?), quite improbable. Additionally I had a hard time understanding what exactly transformed the mother into a killer(?) The ending became marginal and a continuation of the contrivance. Too bad - it had a great story going up until the last quarter of it's run-time.",f

24,25 November 2020,latinmelkor,6, A touching film that depends on coincidences all the way up to ridiculous,"I have written this review as a response to all those who find in this film a perfect jewel and label it as underrated (although in many sites it is highly rated and has more than 100,000 views). It is true that it is a very entertaining and interesting film, and I think that, for many viewers, the obvious weaknesses of the film are not so obvious.
Something that I liked and called attention to is the narrative structure. Some twins (female and male) find out from their mother's will that they have a brother and that their father is alive. The mother commands them to find them both. During the first part of the film, only the daughter decides to carry out her mother's wishes, and to do so she travels to a Middle Eastern country (which is never specified) where, as she travels through places that played an important role in her mother's life, we are presented with her biography through flashbacks. It is easy to feel confused at first with the factions (Christian and Muslim), because they do not correspond to a historical reality, but rather were made in the service of fiction. However, little by little, the viewer is able to put the puzzle back together and discover the hard life that the woman led in the midst of violence and intolerance.
The film has a lot of plot-twists that manage to arouse the interest of their audience and, to a certain extent, are presented in such a way that it is possible to glimpse them when they approach. Unfortunately, the film depends too much on coincidences of sudden and unexplained developments. About this, in many occasions I found elements that, although they should seem natural, were not very well explained and, of course, for the final outcome to happen the scriptwriters took the coincidences to the last consequences.
Although Nawal Marwan seems to live in a rural environment, she is able to move to a relative who works at a university. Despite the fact that at first she cannot read or write (at around 21 years of age), she soon manages to work at a newspaper writing articles. The screenwriters made Marwan a prodigious mind: even though she began receiving education as an adult, within a few years she is able to infiltrate as a tutor to the son of an extremist Christian leader she was tasked to kill, teaching him French and English. After killing this leader, she is finally captured and taken to a prison where she is tortured for no less than 15 years. After being raped by one of her captors and becoming pregnant, she is released (instead of executed) and, with the help of the warlord who benefited from the Christian leader's death, she's exiled to Canada.
The same pattern is repeated in the son's story. He is left in an orphanage where, ultimately, is recruited by an extremist Muslim group. There he is trained as a militia officer, a sniper. He is not just any sniper, of course, he is the most skilled and recognized of all. Eventually, the enemy faction, the Christians, manage to capture him, but, because of his ability, they decide not to execute him but to recruit him themselves (wasn't it supposed to be a holy war?) and, moreover, they do not train him as a sniper (there is no justification for it), but as a torturer. In his new job he ends up working in the prison where, by chance, his mother is. He unknowingly rapes her, she gets her pregnant and thus he becomes the twins' father and brother at the same time.
This is shocking and, I admit, makes one reflect on the way in which war separates people who, in peace, would live together happily. It is a sad and painful story, incisive and critical of the senselessness of war, but it is weakened by its dependence on so many unjustified elements. And, without a doubt, what put me most against the film was how the mother came to know that the one who raped her was her own son. In a swimming pool, the woman sees a man who, on his foot, has the tattoo with which she marked her son to identify him. Then, upon discovering his face, she is horrified that her son is the father of the twins, the rapist. The pain of the scene is diluted by the coincidences: her son emigrated from the country where he was originally and precisely that country is Canada and, besides, she finds him in a pool, where she can see his foot and recognize the mark. Finally, the son is unable to recognize her as his victim, so the man does not run away, fearing that he will be denounced for his past crimes. By leaving her will, the mother entrusts her children with the torturous task of discovering that they are their own brother's children, a task that would be impossible were it not for the fact that they are ""lucky"" enough to correlate the records and find the people who could lead them to the truth.
Although I have vilified the film, in reality it is a very beautiful film visually, with an impeccable performance and a catchy plot, but it depends on coincidences that become ridiculous and take it away from a perfect rating.",t

26,10 February 2011,cultfilmfan,10, Incendies,"Incendies is based on the play by Wajdi Mouawad. The film is a Canadian film in French and Arabic with English subtitles. Going into the theatre to see Incendies, I really knew nothing about it. I had not read any of the reviews that came out, but I had heard from the television news shows that it was supposed to be very good and now with a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, I assumed that it was going to be a really good film. I decided not to read anything about the plot before I saw the film because these days I find that so many critics gave away too much crucial information of the films in their reviews that when you finally do see the film it does not have the same affect on you. So having known nothing about Incendies and then watching the story unfold before my eyes was quite an experience and I would recommend you do the same if you are at all inclined to go see it. Other than the film's director Denis Villeneuve, I was not familiar with anybody else who appeared in the film, or worked on the sides, but I must say that they all did a fantastic job. This is the type of film that when you are watching it, you are not quite sure what will happen, or how the climax, or the ending will come, but when it does, it makes sense to you and leaves you with a multitude of feelings. At times Incendies was not always the most easy film to watch, not because it was overly violent, or graphic because I thought everything was handled in a very tastefully done way, but it still sucks so much emotion out of us and we get to care so much for the characters and what they are going through as we watch it before our eyes, that we can not help but feel sad, enraged, or even physically ill watching it at times. I should clarify that the film does deal with some of the goings on with the Middle East and the wars, tension and prejudices that came out of some of those wars and moments of terror that people at that time and still are going through. I also liked how when dealing with such a tricky and controversial subject matter such as this that as I mentioned it was all very tastefully done and none of it felt like you were watching a Hollywood movie. I think if this had been a big budget, big name star movie extravaganza, then it probably would not have worked. The reason it works so well as it is, is because the fact that it is so character driven and deals with events that have gone on in the past and in some similar and different ways are still going on today. The film felt personal to me. It felt like the people involved with the film had something to say and instead of sugar coating everything and making it an easily watchable film with a feel good portion of it, it instead goes for all your emotions and in a sense almost takes you on the journey and the personal trials and tribulations that the characters in the movie have gone on and understandably we can almost feel their pain, exhaustion and hurt because the performances have this sense of believability and authenticity to them, that everything we see them go through feels like the real thing and the way they handle each situation is believable and not far fetched at all. The characters in the film give us something to believe in because they are searching for the truth and will go to many lengths to find it, even if at times it is difficult, or even dangerous and the amount of honour and pride they carry with them to set out someone's wishes is truly remarkable. This is an incredibly powerful film that as I mentioned, does put you through an array of different emotions, but I did not mind that because I felt I could connect with the characters more because of this. The look and feel of the film is not big budget or fake looking, which makes all the interior and exterior shots look real and further enhancing the emotions, or moods we are supposed to feel in each scene. The acting by everyone involved is all terrific here as well and this is just a really well put together film with a great cast and director and wonderful material to work and mold into this brave, haunting and yet life changing experience. I have not seen any of the other Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominees, but having just seen Incendies now, I would say that it has a good chance of winning because of how masterful and great it is. Do not just take my word for it, go and see it when it opens in a theatre near you. This is certainly one of the best films of 2010.",_

41,11 July 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8," It pulls you in close, never letting go until the last frame finally releases you and allows you to expell all your emotions in one gut-wrenched gasp.","Though sometimes it seems as though information is given to us slightly too early, this often leads to some decent dramatic irony and does 'distract' from - and thereby make all the more impactful - the flick's big, blindsiding final reveal which is essentially as shocking as it is sickening, a harrowing revelation for both the audience and the picture's principle characters that has massive repercussions for both, and serves to recontextualise everything that came before it in a significant yet suitably subtle way, mostly making up for the slightly slow pace and occasional meandering that had marred the piece before. Once you've settled into the strange pace and presentation of 'Incendies (2010)', you're treated to an increasingly dark exploration of a woman you know to be dead, whom is still as strong a presence as any other character, and the children who slowly learn about her life alongside us, as we both inch ever closer to an ending that will haunt our memories for days, a tragedy of Greek proportions set against a backdrop of tragedies that all meet that same standard. As each new revelation ratchets up the suspense and plumets us in to increasingly dire territory, an unexpectedly grim realism begins to perforate the entire piece, steeping it in an often unspoken sadness and a thick air of mystery. It's this that gets under your skin and pulls you in deeper, never letting you go until the last frame finally lets you slump back in your seat and release all your emotions in one gut-wrenched gasp. It's an ever-escalating devestation of our expectations. It isn't darkness for darkness sake, rather an exploration of the characters within these situations. It's also the rare film that rests upon withholding information that would seem fairly simple, yet doing so for legitimate narrative reasons, and providing it in intelligent, usually exposition-light ways. While the tragedy exists for a reason, it is indeed tragedy. Blindsiding, unflinching tragedy, at that. The film knows when to show and when not to. All in the aid of making each moment the most impactful it can be, making you feel like you are the child of this poorly-treated, mysterious mother as you learn of her past. You'll often find yourself asking: how can things get worse? Trust me... they do. It's brilliant. 8/10",

47,15 July 2012,gelman@attglobal.net,9, Just Short of Perfect,"Were it not for the fact that the plot is tied in too neat a bow at the very end, ""Incendies"" would be a perfect movie. Told in both the present and the past, the film traces the efforts of twins, Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Maxim Gaudette) to carry out the wish of their dead mother (Lubna Araval) to find and deliver letters to their father and lost brother. The twins go to Lebanon -- Jeanne with conviction, Simon reluctantly. They don't quite know where to begin. The brother, their mother's illegitimate son, was sent to an orphanage. That much is quickly established. But from there on, the film follows the search and also plays back the events in the Lebanese Civil War which separated their mother from her child and from the father or the twins. Once the search was fully under way, this viewer was initially bit confused as to which parts were present and which parts were past because Ms. Desormeaux-Poulin looks at times much like Ms. Araval, so I didn't always know whether I was witnessing the search by the daughter or the war time travails of the mother. It's a minor problem because, soon enough, the two elements -- the search and the war -- diverge and the context identifies daughter and mother. The two women each handle their roles superbly. Simon is a necessary player but M. Gaudette is no more than adequate in the role, which is, in any event, subsidiary to that of mother and daughter.",

This film is revealing a great Director, es pecially when given an original story with such powerful dimensions. Despite being ske ptical as first of the film being shot in Jordan, when dealing with the very specific, multidimensional Lebanese drama, the geographic distance with the land of Lebanon is detaching the film from the strict reality of the place and taking it to whole other level of significance. Jordan's landscape es pecially with the film's photography, are somewhat surrealistic, as if the story was taking place in a deep level of the region's sub-conscious. Villeneuve has managed to delicately craft a story with dimensions that a human mind in its normal condition is not prepared to understand and confront. And yet these things did happen, many times during the war and retelling them is a very not an easy task. Actually a quasi impossible one and yet Villeneuve did it. This has to be the film representing Canada at the Oscars. And it will win.",

Well, no. There is a 'twist' in the story that you could say is cleverly written, it does not make up for the other defects of the film. It's slow, with the character going though to motions of their 'discovery', but none of that makes for interesting scenes. I didn't care much for the characters and certainly failed to identify or sympathize with them (a basic requirement for liking a film). The story takes place in an unidentified Middle-Eastern country (apparently they didn't want to offend any middle eastern people or they think it's all the same over there -whatever) and religion is (surprise, surprise) basically the root cause of all the evil that happens to our protagonist. The sum of all these elements does not add up to a great film. I even turned it off after 35 mins. After a few days I gathered enough courage to plow through the remainder of this film, and it does get a bit better after the slow start. My advice is: there are films you'd think are perfect but there's always such a thing as personal taste.",

Also they are inappropriately cast. It's just not believable that they could be the offspring of this immigrant mother who had such a tortured past. The story is compelling and told in a way that really grabbed my attention and kept me excited to see what part would be told next. Although it can be challenging to present events in this manner, this film does an excellent job of helping the viewer follow the events of past and present as they are skillfully unwound to paint a picture of what has really happened. If the movie had cast more appropriate and talented actors for the roles of the twins, and perhaps used one or two fewer crazy coincidences, I think it could have been great.",

But what I find inexplicable, as well as frightening, is how so many people who have seen 'Incendies' appear incapable of seeing it for what it is, i.e., a Muslim propaganda film. While the protagonist of the story is an Arab Christian, her character clearly serves no other purpose than as a medium for illustrating completely unprovoked evils of her own people against the Muslims, who are all portrayed in this film as the most perfectly innocent victims one could possibly imagine. It is worth noting that the lead actress in Incendies also played a major role in 'Paradise Now,' a Palestinian film in which it is the Jews who are portrayed as the unprovoked tormentors of the Muslim people. While there have in fact been incidents of violence against Muslims by non-Muslims, there is a long and indisputable history of Muslims committing acts of violence upon not only non-Muslims but each other. And while I've seen much passion, beauty and poetry in films written by Muslims, I have unfortunately never seen a single one that even attempts to show any sympathy whatsoever with non-Muslims or that places any responsibility whatsoever upon the Muslim people for any kind of problem facing them. But equally disheartening is how many people--including some of those who are the objects of the lopsided demonization portrayed in so many Muslim-made films--subscribe to such blatant hatred and lies.",

As the tale swept over me during it's length I could see the honourable statements the filmmakers were making about war. I took a point off for the ending, which, for me, strayed off message and was one bombshell too many.

146,25 June 2011,jadepietro,7, Imagine When 1 + 1 Doesn't Equal 2,"This film is recommended.  Imagine there's no countries, It isn't hard to do, Nothing to kill or  die for, And no religion too.  -Lyrics from John Lennon's Imagine   Religion has always been a unifying and emotional force to some and a  polarizing and divisive one to others. It has shaped and guided our  world with the holiest of words and actions and also destroyed and  misled many under the philosophical guise of good and godliness. It has  provided insight and strength to one group while blinding and weakening  another with overt powers over its most devout believers. This dualism  is ever present in the thought-provoking Oscar nominated foreign film,  Incendies, directed by Denis Villeneuve. We are forced to examine the  far-reaching effect of religion and its aftereffects in its tale of two  siblings who begin a spiritual journey to fulfill their mother's last  wishes.  The plot involves a twin brother and sister who are forced to confront  their mother's past deeds and secretive life. Jeanne and Simon (  Melissa Desormeaux and Maxim Gaudette ) are given two letters from  their dead mother, Newal ( Lubna Azabal ). They are asked to locate  their brother who they never knew had existed and deliver an envelope  to him and also find their lost father. This request takes Jeanne to a  Middle Eastern country as she tries to unravel the mystery while Simon  looks elsewhere.  Told in flashback, mostly from Newal's point of view, we learn about  her unknown past and her loves. Just as Jeanne and Simon unravel the  threads of her lifestory, we discover the impact that politics and  religion formed upon her mother and Newal's ultimate choices that led  her to a violent conflicted existence.   The film takes its bleak depressing subject matter and immerses itself  directly into the world of civil wars, martyrs, violence, and religious  zealots. Director Villeneuve successfully shows this clash of cultures  between Christians and Muslims and the consequences of hatred and  pointless bloodshed throughout the years. However, he weakens his own  film by allowing some scenes to go on too long, causing less tension  and suspense with his narrative. With his cumbersome flashback  structure, he also divulges key evidence in the ongoing investigation  to the movie audience before his present day characters can unravel the  intricacies of the mystery itself. ( I, for one, figured out the  supposedly shocking climax with a half hour left before the film's end  credits appeared. )  Still, the film contains powerful images, mostly when dealing with the  film's violent nature ( a bus and its passengers set afire, close-ups  of battered and bruised legs of political prisoners, a frightened child  cold-bloodedly shot as she tries to flee for safety ) and strong  performances by its cast, especially Lubna Azabel as the sad and  tortured woman whose death begins this tale.  Incendies presents both worlds with a haunting clarity, one steeped in  traditions and servitude and another trying to break free of its bonds.  This is serious and fearless filmmaking that leaves one feeling moved  and helpless at the same time. The moviegoer leaves the theater hoping  the world will live as one, even if the equation can never be solved.  GRADE: B",

150,26 March 2012,drpakmanrains,6, Great Ending to a Slow Convoluted Slog,"I know I am in the minority regarding this widely acclaimed film, but after reading a review of ""In A Better World"" saying how terrible it was compared to this and the other nominated foreign films of 2010, I was expecting this film to be much better than I felt it actually is. Let me say that I realize it is ambitious and well acted, but it is done in a manner that I find rather annoying, that is where a mystery requires the principals to find something in the past, and everyone they encounter at first is reluctant to help, and then seems to be able to supply an additional bit of information, which leads to the next encounter. They rarely encounter dead ends, and their mother escapes one treacherous moment after another, much like Indiana Jones, or the Bourne films, which I find unlikely and ultimately empty at the core. I know those films are very popular, so if you like those, you will probably like this slower paced one. However, the ending was indeed different, and quite interesting. Had the ending been predictable from the start I would have rated this a 2 or 3, as it also kept switching from the present to flashbacks without the viewer realizing which it was, making the first half of the film hard to follow. I admit I prefer movies that try to tell a straightforward story, and if they use flashbacks, it is fine if they signal it someway. For me, ""In a Better World"" was the masterpiece. This was just a well made overlong formulaic indie with a terrific ending which almost made the trip worthwhile, but not quite.",

It is rated 8,3 and is in the top 250, I can not see why that would be so. There is absolutely no depth to any character, no motivation, no background. The problems in some unknown unspecified middle east country are black and white. The only reason why you would make it so is that you do not want to do any research to make the situation believable. But the nail in the coffin was the unbelievable (literally) story. How did the writer get away with such a plot? At least when you read Sophocles you know there is much more to it than just the plot.

184,1 August 2012,blondalien,1, What a load of old tosh!,"The high scoring of this film makes me really lose my faith in human kind as it is a direct reflection of how numb and tolerant people are to mindless, brutal violence. Child murder, mass slaughter, sons raping mothers - who wants to tolerate that sort of barbaric behaviour??? Not only is the storyline so extremely fetched,physically and emotionally violent and so sick and twisted that you can't actually believe what you're watching, but there is a really dangerous religious message to the story too. There are a lot of annoying things about the film too, like where are they? Why do they fight? which time are we in? It keeps going back and forth in time. Why does the son look about 40 when he was meant to be abput 19 and then doesn't recognise the woman he raped systematically? Why are the ""twins"" supremely intelligent being a product of their brother and mother- surely they would have some birth defects being so closely related? Why do none of them age in appearance throughout the film, making it impossible to gauge what's going on? And what on earth is the 1+1=1 about???",

There is a cinematic treasure here, to be invited innocently, first-hand, to view the ravages of a civil and religious war on an otherwise normal society - all played out within its stunning rugged countryside. We are walked through scene after scene with our central character guide to view the realities of war - how people suffer and learn to hate. This does not exclude the central character; even she responds to terrorism with a focused retaliative vengeance. ",

The film brings home the horrors of war, the dynamics of family and gives insight into Arab culture...much of which is unknown to the west. Some of the view-points and events concerning the sectarian violence were very one-sided and inaccurate (hence why they did not exactly name this as taking place in Lebanon), but if you can overlook this, you will undoubtedly be rewarded with a gut-wrenching yet masterfully powerful film.",

Even if you're absolutely heartless, you' ll still be captured by its story and its shocking yet unfortunately, very much part of the real world, scenes. Now if you do have a heart after all, you'll be touched that deeply by its hard and heartbreaking-yet not melodramatic at all- truth, that it will take you days to overcome it. How wouldn't you?

But eventually we got the hang of it and the very unusual plot which we are introduced to at the beginning as twins Jeanne and Simon are being read their mother's will and realize she has asked them to carry out her final wishes and deliver two letters on her behalf. Their task seems almost as difficult as finding a needle in a haystack. If you don't mind fiction being stranger than the really terrible things that happen to people in these type of wars, the movie provides a gripping story. It is horrifying at times with what should be an unexpected ending. It provides lessons of persistence, forgiveness, motherly love and an appreciation that any one of us if we were switched at birth, could be quite the opposite of the person we turned out to be.

The story of two kids finding out about their mothers past in order to find out their brother and father, is very well paced and one that will stick long in the memory. The way the storyline of the mother in a war torn country flows into the modern day and back again is very well done and shows how well orchestrated the film was by director Denis Villeneuve, who can do it smalltime as well as the big blockbusters that have seen him gain more recognition of late. The actors were all pretty great, whether that be the mother searching for her son and traumatised and beaten by the harsh reality of war, her angry son who doesn't want to seek things out, before being faced head on with the truth and of course the eager sister, who by the end finds more then she bargained for. The plot twist at the end was a huge surprise, that was well done and was certainly left field. A few minor issues with some of the scenes being a bit implausible like the boy getting purposely captured by a warlord to find more about his mother, but they didn't deter too much. A very well told story, which I will certainly be watching again. Not wholly original, but deep and engrossing cinema that will hook you to the very end. Score: 8.5/10.",

218,2 April 2019,charbelelaro,9, This movie is amazing,"Incendies Directed by Denis Villeneuve is a foreign film with one of the most intriguing stories I've ever come across.

They become incredibly distraught after finding out their mother wishes not to be buried traditionally until a letter is sent to their brother and father. The twins were unaware that they had a brother and a living father, therefore leading to an investigation in order to complete the task. Everything in this film is phenomenal. Every single performance is outstanding. The realism depicted by these actors blew me away. Denis' direction, as usual is perfect. He captures moments of horror so well, utilising close ups and big wide shots when necessary. There are so many moments in the film which look incredible. Incendies has one of the most insane ending revelations I've ever experienced in film. Although it isn't pretentious or cheap due to the phenomenal writing. I was so compelled by this movie for the entire runtime. The story rarely has a dull moment, due to the uneasy and suspenseful plot. Incendies should be seen by all.

225,18 April 2019,gherk-man99,10, One of Villeneuve's best,"This film begins with a simple and captivating concept- a Mother dies, leaving some strange requests in her will about finding a lost brother and Father, which her twin son and daughter were not aware existed.
From the very first scene you can't help but be pulled in by the mystery behind the past of this woman. Through a series of flashbacks involving the Mother, we learn about her dark past as the twins try to unravel this last request their Mother left them.
This film is defiantly one of Denis' more dark and serious films. A lot like the film 'Prisoners' Denis would go on to make in 2013, Incendies is about the love that a parent has for her children, and the lengths she will go to protect them. Visually, this film is very saturated in shots of war zones, turmoil and Iranian landscapes. Each tense scene that takes place within Iran is as shocking and new for the audience as it is for the children. Obviously, with this being one of Denis' first films, he has a passion for making sound a big part of his films, as he displays in later films like Arrival, Blade Runner and Sicario. Every threatening sound comes across as quite jarring and real, only adding to the incredible sense of hostility he builds between the main characters and the antagonists. The biggest thing I can appreciate about this film is the way Denis does not underestimate or patronise his audience. He very carefully feeds you segments of the narrative so you can fully build it up in your head, but does not make it stupidly obvious. This is also his most political film, and although you don't need to know much about the conflicts in Iran in the 70s, it really adds to the depth and tone of the story, complimenting it very nicely. There were plenty of moments throughout this film that left me shocked and in awe at how visceral and surprising they were. So far, I haven't seen a Denis Villeneuve film that I haven't appreciated in one form or another, and he will definitely go down as one of the great directors in modern cinema history.",

It took me about 10 minutes after watching it to be able to do anything (eventually I had a smoke). Everything that composes a film, editing, camera work, acting, all the choices for narrative, converge most perfectly, emerging as the most complete whole I have seen on the screen in a long time, at once hauntingly beautiful and quietly earth-shattering. And, as it always seems to go with Villeneuve, there's not a single superfluous grain. There's no lingering, no exploiting of cruelty (each aspect and scene of the sort is thus also presented in the most tactful way), the soundtrack as well is reduced to what is necessary, to much greater effect. The camera is closely kept on the protagonists (without exception every performance is excellent), wider shots are reserved to set the stage. War is seen through the eye of the intimate in a fact-finding odyssey into the past. Virtuous also the division of these time-lines without ever confusing, and never l'art pour l'art, but an essential story-tool. The story itself is in the end the main character.

If he hadn't run into him she would have never written the letters in the first place so the whole story would have never developed. It feels so dumb. For just these points I can't give more than 4/10. Good cinematography but not an enjoyable movie for me after all.",

While I won't let out the climax, the timeline does not make any sense. She gave birth to a child at say the age of 20 and went away to study. She was in university and then joined this band of terrorists, committed murder for them and then went to jail. So add another 10 years at max.

But the script wasn't very compelling. Dialogue was basic. Maybe this is due to translation to subtitles. I really don't like how it mixes fictional locations with real life locations, it blurs the line too much and as a viewer I was lost as to where I was not just geographically but within the story. It made you doubt the authenticity of it all and judging by the reviews left here by lebanese people, it was a poor representation of events here. The mother played her role really well, the other actors were quite forgettable really. I generally agree with a lot of user reviews on IMDB but this one isn't for me personally.",

Either way, it certainly is a film worth talking about. An extraordinary film. I agree with the review concerning the violence ; it was handled very sensitively by Villeneuve.

259,5 June 2023,HenRex,8, Most powerful opening sequence in a long time,"The film begins in what looks like a defunct school. The windows are broken and we pan inside to look at kids getting buzzcuts. The kids are young, some have dried flakes of blood in their faces, one particularly young kid has a black eye. Although we don't know who they are, where they came from, where they are going, nor why this is happening, we do get the sense that a major human tragedy is taking place right before our eyes. The adults are standing guard with loaded rifles in heavy duty boots, seemingly not protecting the kids, but making sure they stay in place. Then, in a gripping sequence, the camera centers on a young boy currently having his hair cut off. The scene is painfully slow to a point. The boy looks at us, the audience, defiantly. His demeanor appears understandably angry. And then, just when the scene has lasted long enough to evoke empathy, we see it; underneath it all his glance is accusatory-j'accuse. Why are we just looking on and doing nothing? Incendies may have one of the most emotionally
powerful introductory sequences of any movie I have watched in a long time.",

We re thinking again from another perspective: Abou Tarek became a good sniper, it means, he should be about 20-25 and then he get caught and was trained to become a torturer and went to the prison.
