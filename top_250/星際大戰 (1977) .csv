1,23 April 2016,ivo-cobra8,10," A classics, phenomenal and arguably the best sci-fi flick masterpiece!","Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) is a classic phenomenal arguably the best sci-fi film in trilogy away, the one that started all and arguably changed the face of cinema forever. I love this film is actually my number 1 favorite film in the franchise and it is George Lucas masterpiece - the man who make this film happening. He wrote and Directed him self, I love this film to death! I love everything that is in A New Hope. Before I go in to this movie I want to say after watching the new awful horrible movie Episode VII The Force Awakens, I decide to re watch the original Star Wars Trilogy and I have always loved A New Hope and I always will. This was the first film in the trilogy that I have saw as a kid and that I remember. Star Wars are starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.",r
2,16 January 2020,UniqueParticle,10, Legendary piece of cinema,"Only seen the original Star Wars films a few times, I tend to forget how great of a magical experience it is! A New Hope is so awesome in so many aspects especially the music and sounds of everything! It's amazing how it was made for it's time I still I don't understand how they did many things. I will admit it has a few bits that are boring but still glorious. Up until a few years ago I didn't see most of the films and I didn't understand the hype now I do in which I'm happy with them all even seen the new ones.",e
3,25 December 2005,Bogmeister,9," The Best of Sci-Fi Times,the Worst of sf Times","Though now known as ""Episode IV-A New Hope,"" for many of us, namely those of us who first saw this exhilarating entertainment in theaters back in '77, this will always be the first ""Star Wars."" We will always think of it as just ""Star Wars"" - plain & simple, no pretensions, no aspirations to deep film-making or high art. This is where we first met them all: Luke, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi (old 'Ben'), Chewbacca, the 2 robots C3PO & R2D2 and, of course, Darth Vader. They were instant pop culture icons; you got the sense you'd seen them before somewhere, but were sure this wasn't possible. But they'd been there before in our minds. We'd read about them constantly in science fiction novels and short stories - tales of outer space civilizations, of spaceships zooming through asteroid belts, of exotic-looking aliens hanging around space ports. We'd dream about them at night and try to imagine ourselves in their midst; up until then, we could only imagine such things - there were no projected images to realize such dreams. ""Forbidden Planet"" from 1956 came close, and then there were the ""Star Trek"" and ""Lost in Space"" TV series, both hampered by dime store budgets and cheesy sets. We ate 'em up since there was nothing else. Then Lucas made it real.",v

5,22 October 2003,Sfpsycho415,10, Where It All Began-----10/10,"I can never pick a favorite movie because different movies have different effects. Goodfellas is my favorite drama. Face/Off is my favorite actioner. But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats Star Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different creatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped in the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion that has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most fascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still a Star Wars nerd.",e

If I had to sum it up in one word, superlative would be my answer. I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.",w
7,25 April 2005,budmassey,10, The greatest cinematic epic of all time begins here.,"Here begins the greatest cinematic epic of all time, and arguably one of the greatest stories ever told.

12,6 October 2008,Tweekums,9, A long time ago in a decade without CGI...,"When I first watched this in the cinema I was ten, it was 1977 and I'd never seen anything like it. It had me gripped from the start when a small spacecraft flew past being fired upon by another much larger one that was so big that it seemed to take ages to pass over the viewer. Unlike the recent prequels scenes such as this weren't cluttered with excessive CGI activity but instead showed what was needed in a way that hadn't been seen before. The special effects used throughout the film were ground-breaking for the time and still look great to this day, there is something more real looking about the models used when compared to today's CGI.",5

Oh, the anticipation! The excitement! The magic! And here was a film that changed the whole concept of cinema forever, for no matter how many times I return to it, in the flickering dark of the cinema, or the wondrous, glittering DVD release, or in where the film really scores - at the centre of my imagination, that night will live forever in my memory. ANYTHING was possible, wonders could be achieved. Miracles in the here and now. And how lucky I was to share in it.",7
17,21 February 2007,Marx_Bros_Fan86,10, Just plain fun!,"Star Wars seems to lack the sense of importance that all of the sequels and prequels had. This one just seeks to entertain, and there's nothing wrong with that! Star Wars is one of those miracle movies (a term borrowed from Leonard Maltin) where everything went wrong but it all came together in the end, like Jaws and The Wizard of Oz. The movie was plagued by budget problems, and Lucas was so behind schedule he suffered a few panic attacks, which is probably why he did not direct the sequels. ",/

20,2 November 2015,Horst_In_Translation,6, A great movie - for its time,"""Star Wars"" is a 2-hour science fiction movie from almost 30 years ago written and directed by George Lucas. There really needs nothing to be said about how good this is for a 1970s movie, especially in terms of technical aspects. The Academy certainly got it right by giving them all these Oscars for it. However, it lacks in certain other areas unfortunately. First of all, the acting isn't too great. That is not really a problem of the characters though, but rather of the way they were written, which simply offered no room for outstanding performances. And Peter Cushing's character was downright forgettable despite being the main antagonist. Instead people remember Darth Vader obviously. Why? Because this film is all about the way the characters look and not what they do or say. A bit style over substance. Apart from that, I am quite surprised Alec Guinness scored an Academy Award nomination for his turn here.",e

23,22 February 2007,disdressed12,10, the landmark space fantasy,"what can you say about his movie.it set the bar by which all movies to come would be judged,and this was 1977.i'm talking about the visual effects,which were nothing less than astounding.it still stands up well to any movie in that regard.remember,they didn't have the benefit of CGI back then,so they relied on miniatures.when you add to that,a compelling story and a soon to be iconic villain(not to mention,the colourful cast of characters)and you have box office gold.sure,the dialogue may be wooden and stilted at times,but that is overshadowed by the achievement of the film.Besides,the film was marketed at 12 year olds,so they're not gonna care about stupid things like dialogue.The original ""Star Wars"" or as it is subtitled ""a New Hope,was a landmark film and single handedly reinvented the science fiction genre.

24,16 December 2019,masonsaul,10, Near perfect sci-fi adventure,"Star Wars (A New Hope) is a near perfect sci-fi adventure that's incredibly bold, original and extremely entertaining. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Anthony Daniels and Carrie Fisher all give incredible performances. James Earl Jones is fantastic as Darth Vader, one of the best villains of all time. Alec Guinness gives a great supporting performance. The visual effects are stunning and still look really good. It's extremely well paced and genuinely thrilling throughout with excellent action sequences and space battles.

26,6 June 2007,classicsoncall,10," ""May the Force be with you.""","I couldn't let the thirtieth anniversary season of ""Star Wars"" slip by without a commemorative viewing today to remind me of the start of this hugely successful franchise. Though it's not one of my own personal Top Ten films of all time, I can understand how so many fans come to see it that way. At the time it was a seminal film that reinvigorated the sci-fi genre; my first viewing when it debuted in theaters garnered more than a single 'Whoa' with each new scene and concept that hadn't been done before. I was particularly intrigued with the names of the characters George Lucas created for his heroes, sounding uniquely original and matching their physical description and characters. Could Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, or Princess Leia have been called anything else? How about Jabba the Hutt; he looks exactly how a Jabba the Hutt would look if there was a Jabba the Hutt. Makes sense, doesn't it? ",_
27,13 December 2015,claudio_carvalho,10, The Unforgettable Episode,"During the attack of the Empire's forces under the command of Darth Vader (David Prowse) to her spacecraft, the rebel Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) hides in the memory of R2-D2 the plans of the powerful Empire's Station Death Star that spies from the Rebel Alliance have stolen. She assigns the droid to deliver the plans to Obi-Wan Kenobi with a message to give the plans to the rebels. R2-D2 flees to the Planet Tatooine with his fellow C-3PO in a space pod and land on the desert, but they are captured by Jawa traders. They are sold to Owen Lars (Phil Brown) and when his nephew Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is cleaning the droid, he accidentally activates part of the message and he wonders whether it would be addressed to the old Ben Kenobi. On the next morning, Luke discovers that R2-D2 is seeking out Obi-Wan Kenobi and he goes after him with C-3PO. They are attacked by the Tusken Raiders and saved by a drifter, who is Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that tells part of his past as Jedi to Luke. He also tells that his father was a Jedi Knight and gives a light-saber that belonged to his father to Luke. Obi-Wan invites Luke to travel with him to Alderaan and when he finds that his family was killed by the Imperial soldiers, he decides to join Obi-Wan in his quest. They head to Mos Esley to hire a skilled pilot and they team-up with the smugglers Han-Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Meanwhile the evil Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) orders to destroy the planet Alderaan to show the power of the Death Star to Leia and the rebels. Obi-Wan feels the impact in the Force and when the Millennium Falcon arrives at the destination, the group finds only debris. Further, a tractor beam pulls the spacecraft to the Death Star. What will happen to the group and Princess Leia? Will they succeed in delivering the information to the rebels?",u
28,25 February 2007,BA_Harrison,10, I get all choked up just thinking about it.,There was no way my review of this classic slab of pulp sci-fi was ever going to be anything but glowing; as a nine year old I saw George Lucas' space opera on its original release and instantly became one of a legion of fans who spent the next twenty years worshipping at the altar of the great turkey-necked director (until The Phantom Menace shattered all of my illusions).,r

31,24 September 2011,itamarscomix,9," A classic tale of heroism, of magic and revenge","Before there was a trilogy, before there were prequels, before there was an expanded universe with hundreds of books, comics and video games, before Greedo shot first and before Jar Jar Bink was a speck of light in George Lucas' eye, there was Star Wars. Even if it's not the best film in the series (it's not), Star Wars deserves its own place in the history of cinema, as a work that changed Hollywood forever. It brought back the grandness of the epic cinema of the 30's and 40's and multiplied it, creating a new era of spectacle and excitement.",
32,26 March 2006,roghache,9," Brilliant, entertaining space epic of good versus evil","This is an incredibly entertaining and well crafted space epic that has become a modern day legend and spawned several (for me, disappointing) sequels and prequels. This classic is a basic story of good versus evil, combined with a futuristic space setting and special effects. While it may be kind of fun to jokingly tell others 'May the force be with you', no one should seriously be getting their theology from it (as a few cult like followers seem to) since really, it's essentially a science fiction fairy tale.",
33,11 July 2015,AlsExGal,9, A break from the cynical films of the 1970s,"The latest TCM production entitled TCM Presents A Night at the Movies: George Lucas & The World of Fantasy Cinema, was really 2/3 about Lucas's films and it seemed that 2/3 of that was about Star Wars - but that was OK because it finally drove home to me what I have suspected for years - that George Lucas did not and does not have a clue as to what made Star Wars great. He got lucky with the first one (this film) because it was a product of its time and was what people WANTED to see in 1977 - something hopeful and fun. Remember - or maybe you are too young to remember - movies in the mid 70s were extremely cynical post Watergate and post Vietnam. This one was different and even religious in an ecumenical way. Lucas got lucky with the second one because of the director and his input. To me, all the ones that came after The Empire Strikes Back were special effects filled duds. Now back to the original.",
34,25 May 2015,Mr-Fusion,9, Pure uncut escapism,"In all honesty, I didn't plan on watching ""Star Wars"" on its 38th anniversary, but a happy accident nonetheless. To see this movie is to go back to a time when the mythology was in its nascent stages, before all the merchandising and parodies (really, a testament to its cultural impact, which is immense). It's deceptively simple; all of the classical elements are here - clearly defined heroes and villains, robots, space pirates, wizards, princesses, sorcery - remixed and flung off into a faraway galaxy. It all makes for a potent brew, to say the least. And when all is said and done, the movie's real power is its ability to tap into the kid in all of us. This is just plain fun, and not even Lucas' shoddy CGI rejiggering can tarnish that.",
35,16 June 2007,OllieSuave-007,8, An Epic Movie of the Galaxy.,"This is the movie that probably changed sci-fi and fantasy films of the cinema, full of action, imagination, nostalgia, character development and charm. The 4th movie of the Star Wars trilogy, but the first and original Star Wars movie filmed, it starts with a ship being invaded by Darth Vader, who has kidnapped Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Later on, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) teams up with Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Ben Kenobi (Alec Guiness), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) in an attempt to rescue the Princess Leia, who leads a group of rebels to defy the evil empire controlled by a ruthless Sith Lord and guarded by his trusted servant, Darth Vader. They must also stop the Death Star from destroying the galaxy. The result is one huge mission to save the galaxy, supported by superb direction and story from George Lucas and a memorable music score from John Williams.",
36,23 March 2013,StevePulaski,10," Another experience I delayed far, far too long","George Lucas' Star Wars is a project unlike one I've seen before, as clich√© and as empty as that statement might sound. It's a monumental achievement in the cinematic world, arguably the biggest one ever, that pioneered special effects work and accommodated for other science-fiction projects to follow in the next decades. When released in 1977, with sufficient hype and outstanding reviews, it was a movie-going experience; thousands of showings were sold out (something you never hear about anymore), universal audiences were captivated, cultists and enthusiasts were born, and the eye-popping technology was cherished and admired by many.",
37,25 November 2015,sharky_55,9," A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away","Star Wars begins not with opening credits, as the guild would enforce in those days, but with a scrawl that has become legendary. Back then, it was a few lines of yellow text scrolling across a lengthy screen that would be photographed on the backdrop of an infinite star- field, losing itself in a vanishing point far, far away. A modest effect, yet those words instantly paint a picture so incredibly vivid that it would kick-start a hugely popular and successful franchise. And it is nothing without its iconic fanfare by John Williams. Take a listen to Holst's Mars movement and see how Williams transforms all the heroism, all the grandiosity and glory into one of the most recognisable themes of all time. And then we pan down and observe a little ship being pursued by a gigantic one, something so immediately identifiable, and we already are entranced. ",
38,12 April 2020,Med-Jasta,10, The most important movie of all time,"Who would have thought that an experimental director would have had to resurrect classic hero story telling? Well, that's where they were in the 70s. And Lucas did it with such perfection. He did his research and he cared. And most importantly he was trusted to make the movie that he wanted.",
39,1 September 2008,gregmovies,7, A fun film,"Filled with great characters and a fun story, Star Wars is well deserving of its reputation as a classic. John Williams score alone makes this a film worth seeing. The characters are unforgettable and the special effects impressive for its time, but very outdated now. The different alien species are one of the best things about the film. The Cantina scene showing an array of Lucas' creations is particularly fun.",

42,17 May 2006,jdberkley,10, This is the first film I ever saw...,"Having read a lot of the other comments here, I have to say it's interesting to see how many people begin by saying how old they were when they saw ""Star Wars"" for the first time(Full disclosure: I was three. My parents saw it at a drive-in theatre, and all I can remember of that experience was seeing Darth Vader for the first time, and knowing that he was very, very bad). I think that speaks to its extraordinary impact. ""Star Wars"" was an event, I suppose in the way that the Beatles on Ed Sullivan for the first time was an event. It dates you, to a degree, but the reason it was important-- the reason it remains important-- is that it showed you what was possible. For much of the 1960s and 1970s, filmmakers had concentrated on showing us the brutal, heartbreaking truth of our world(The Godfather, Chinatown, Nashville-- some of the best movies ever made), and many of them succeeded brilliantly. But there's a place for dreaming dreams of things that have never been, too, and ""Star Wars"", with its epic tale of an Empire and a rebellion in a galaxy far, far away, was the dream a generation didn't know it wanted to have until George Lucas gave it to us.",

44,20 June 2005,DarthVoorhees,10, This is exactly what a movie should be...,"One word can describe Star Wars...Perfection with a capital P! Star Wars is so perfectly molded together filled with pieces all so crucial yet all so wonderful,John William's A+++ score, or James Earl Jones' powerful voice.Really George Lucas' picture should be put next to the word Lucky in the dictionary.He had such a bizarre concept,and people had doubts.I mean if he was pitching Star Wars to me I would too.Yet this is the Little Movie that Could so to say.The acting is A+,my personal favorite performance is Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi.People would argue about Geogre Lucas not being a great director after the infamous Prequels,that's a load of B.S.Lucas pours his imagination on the screen and the audience is captivated.We have to give a standing ovation to ILM which started in the 70's with Star Wars.The movie is still amazing to look at nearly 30 years later and with C.G.I in the movie making mix.The plot sounds bizarre on paper but it works wonders on screen and flows quickly,I don't believe I have ever checked my watch while watching Star Wars.I have to applaud Mr.Lucas,Star Wars has fueled the imaginations of many and will continue to fuel generations to come.One moment can describe the impact of the whole Star Wars experience/impact for me,the scene where Luke looks into the setting suns accompanied by William's brilliant score.It's a very moving scene.I really think it tells you to look out for more in your life to become something so to say.Star Wars can only be surpassed by it's sequel Empire Strikes Back but looking back at both I think they are even.Empire Stikes Back and Star Wars are in my opinion the best movies ever made",
45,29 August 2019,k_g_barreto,9, The movie that changed pop culture,"In 1977 Star Wars was released and 40 years after its release, pop culture still feels the impact that Star Wars brought it. Fantasy and sci-fi was combined in this classic cult, but the most charming thing about this movie is its characters, although being just introduced and not developed, but that's not a problem at all, in the following episodes they gained more development and deepth. Luke, Han, Leia and Kenobi were all interesting characters, and C3PO and R-2D2 are the most charismatic characters of the movie. Darth Vader, with such a magnificent and well-done design, have a strong presence in screen and keeps you interested about what are his motivations and backgroung, aside from what Obi-Wan told about him in the beginning, we don't know so much about the character.",
46,13 October 2007,griffolyon12,10, Star Wars!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Star Wars, now known as Episode IV: A New Hope, is the perfect showcase of everything that makes a movie great. It is one of those occasions where everything in the film seems to of perfectly fell in place(although if you know the story behind the making of it, it wasn't so smooth). The acting, directing, writing, production design, special effects, and anything else I've forgotten, is simply top-notch. This movie did so many things for film, most notably the special effects, but it also gave us three of the greatest young actors of the late 70s and 80s, Mark Hammill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. Then the film also created the blockbuster, and is the definition of what a blockbuster should be(humor, emotion, action, heart). On the last point the action is probably the most exhilarating and exciting action I've ever seen on film, the Death Star Trench Run is the definite highlight of the film. This film is just simply superb and is picture perfect, and is definitely one of the greatest and most memorable films of all-time. It's hard to believe that this all sprung from one man's imagination, George Lucas(writer/director of the film). STAR WARS!!!!!!!!! ",
47,10 June 2006,ccthemovieman-1,7," Primitive-Looking By Now, But A 'Must"" To Set Up The Series","After seeing all six episodes of the Star Wars saga several times apiece, I still think this initial entry is interesting but one of weaker ones in the series. Perhaps that's because by now, the special-effects look primitive but also because it's a little slow in parts, slower than the other five films. Sometimes, though, it's nice to have more lulls as these modern-day action films many times overdo the violence. This one, however, is just a bit too slow overall.",

51,13 March 2005,SmileysWorld,9," Though not as fresh and eye opening today,it's still a great film.","This film came along at just the right time for me.Upon it's initial release in 1977,I was 12 years old,which is the perfect age to see something this eye opening and different.I remember sitting and watching with just as much awe and amazement as perhaps 12 year olds from past generations seeing their first cowboy movie.I remember the thrills as though I saw it fresh yesterday.Upon seeing it again recently for the first time in many years,now well into my adulthood,I find,unfortunately,that the thrill that came with my first viewing did not come with me across the years.Despite this fact,I still saw a great film,one worthy of any home library.It's suspenseful,thrilling,and contains a great story line and interesting characters that we care about.It was great looking back on Harrison Ford when his hair wasn't quite so gray,Mark Hamill,whom we all thought would go on to be a great film star,though he has done little beyond this trilogy,Carrie Fisher, and,at least in voice,James Earl Jones(Darth Vader).Though the initial childhood thrill is gone,this is still a great film.",
52,5 October 2010,toqtaqiya2,10, George Lucas' mythological popcorn film is a two-hour roller-coaster ride that has passed into movie legend.,"George Lucas spent four years developing and working on the galactic fantasy Star Wars. This was after he directed the dystopian science-fiction film THX 1138 (1971) and the rites-of-passage American Graffiti (1973). Star Wars was inspired by the Flash Gordon cartoon strip. It cost $8 million to make in Britain with three little-known Americans in the leading roles, supported by British actors. The story is a simple adventure yarn, and Lucas draws on samurai films, Westerns and every kind of myth, ancient and modern. The dogfights are based on a close study of World War II films. Star Wars was an immediate success. It became one of the great phenomena of cinematic history. It spawned two sequels, three prequels and endless imitators, creating a demand for spectacular blockbusters that has not yet ended. Industrial Light and Magic, the special effects unit that served the film, became a multi-billion dollar organization. Lucas himself also became and has remained one of Hollywood's most powerful figures. The film certainly struck a nerve in an America recovering from the humiliations of the Vietnam war. Ronald Reagan, elected president three years after Star Wars was made, spoke of the Soviet Union as 'the Evil Empire' and gave his proposed space-defense system the title Star Wars. The original Star Wars trilogy contributed to the worldwide renewal of the filmgoing habit, but in creating an appetite for child-like blockbusters that depend on special effects rather than on character and subtle narrative, the film unfortunately played a key role in what was to be called 'the dumbing down' of America and popular culture.",

When you think of star wars, you must remember what else was happening at the time. In America, the war in Vietnam had been lost. In the U.K economic disaster was occurring(a 3 day working week, and the army collecting rubbish). It was almost like the two most technically advanced countries in the world were going backwards.

59,6 April 2020,deloudelouvain,6, I watched six by now (in chronological order) and this was the weakest one.,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, and Rogue One, it's now time for A New Hope. I get it that it's the oldest one and so the special effects are not of the same level as more recent ones but from all the ones I watched by now I thought this was the weakest one. I probably watched it as a kid and gave up after that as it's just not that good. I don't know why this one gets such a high rating, it's definitely not better than any of the previous titles mentioned. I agree that the used special effects at that time might have looked good for 1977 but still it doesn't make it better. For that the story and the acting were just not of the same quality. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing.The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the sixth movie of eleven in barely 48 hours for me, next one today will be The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi in the hope the quality improves compared to this one, looking forward to it.",

63,22 April 2006,tom-darwin,8, Excellent Excess,"The very first note of John Williams's horn-blaring score as the film's title in thousand-foot-high block letters flashes on screen is the very moment when American film-making turned inexorably to big-budget, grand-themed audiovisual extravaganza strung together with simple stories, snappy catchphrases & cutesy jokes. But if George Lucas decided to follow Henry Ford rather than John Ford, he built a Shelby Cobra & left Pinto-making to his many, many imitators. Ironically, he himself remade one of the finest works of film master Akira Kurosawa, the Western-themed ""Hidden Fortress,"" with one scene (the fight in the bar) lifted from ""Yojimbo."" As a result, ""Star Wars"" has a bit of the jittery discomfort of characters trying to fit into a story that wasn't quite made for them, like people with past life experiences that intrude into the present. Kurosawa's hero is split not into two but THREE heroes in ""Star Wars"" (four if you include the princess, who has a more prominent role in ""Star Wars""). Hamill's Luke is often overshadowed by Kenobi (Guinness, whose skill had aged better than any fine wine) and Solo (Ford, in the role that deservedly made him a star), though he often holds his own as the clueless but determined farmboy-turned-hero. In less than five minutes, ""Star Wars"" sets the standard of outer-space audiovisual special effects that the industry was bound to follow from then on, forever sweeping away the earnest, toylike realism that Gerry Anderson was then giving us in ""Space: 1999"" in favor of exhausting but beautiful orgies of fast, violent, sweeping movement culminating in explosions of bright color & blaring sound. No wonder there's never any sex. ""Star Wars"" is science fiction only because it's set in outer space, by which standard ""Dirty Harry"" is a detective story & ""Last Tango in Paris"" a romance. Little attempt is made to explain the technological wonders depicted (we never find out why light sabers never have to be recharged or get even a cursory explanation of the Death Star). What little science there is can't be counted on, as when Solo extols the drag-racing abilities of the Millennium Falcon in parsecs, which are units of distance, not elapsed time. But Lucas never means to educate, only to entertain. Solo is a smuggler, not a science officer, while the others are not doctors or engineers but warriors, royalty or villains. Lucas's hammerhanded excess works because it never lets up & never goes for the cheap & easy. Though the heroes are unconvincing, ""Star Wars"" creates an array of badguys in the Galactic Empire that remain unsurpassed in cinema, headed by Darth Vader, who makes the Wicked Witch of the West look like Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle. In another irony, the most memorable scene in ""Star Wars"" is the motionless roundtable conference chaired by Tarkin (Cushing, in the greatest role of his long career) which yielded phrases long & gleefully repeated by a delighted America (""This station is now the ultimate power in the universe!"" ""This bickering is pointless!"" ""I find your lack of faith disturbing""). Perhaps, with the space program petering out & the hard realities of nuclear energy coming home to us, our fascination with scientific exploration was wearing thin. In the 1960s it enabled the cast of ""Star Trek"" to bring the writings of sci-fi geniuses to life with cardboard & aluminum foil. Never again. What better honor, or infamy if you like, could there be to ""Star Wars"" than that the ""Star Trek"" movies of the 1980s followed the simple themes, cuteness & spectacular effects of ""Star Wars,"" turning their backs on their own heritage of awed exploration? Perhaps that first detractors and then supporters of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative nicknamed it ""Star Wars"" so convincingly that the original name was quickly forgotten. The film might be a bit dated with its holistic, New Age mysticism (feel the force FLOWING through you!) which likely owes more to Jack Kerouac than Musashi Miyamoto & which became more difficult to depict with a straight face the farther the sequels & prequels went. Nevertheless, it was a worthy successor to the Code of the West, especially in contrasting Darth Vader with Luke & Kenobi. ""Star Wars"" can't really be judged by the standards of other films, partly because it reset the standards & partly because it became, most unusually, the fourth in a series of six! But there's no doubt that it's a heroic sensory extravaganza that will leave the viewer at once exhausted & exhilarated--and will do it over & over again, without offending, condescending or making one think too hard. If you just want to escape to a galaxy far, far away, jettison all skepticism, lower your shields & prepare to make the jump to hyperspace.",

71,25 May 2005,jscontoyannis,10, The opening installment of the greatest trilogy in cinematic history...,"Truly a landmark film. When it came out, there had never been anything like it before, and it truly caused quite a stir. I would contend that it is not as good as its sequel, Empire Strikes Back; but it is still a great movie. There is humor, action, and some heartfelt moments. It is also our introduction to some great characters that people will never forget - Chewbacca, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi...and of course everyone's favorite villain, Darth Vader. Alec Guinness really is outstanding in this movie. His role as Luke's first mentor is understated and believable...his somewhat tired attitude in retrospect seems very understandable after watching the prequels - after all he's been through, it is very believable when he tells Luke, ""I'm getting to old for this sort of thing."" The visual effects are not only groundbreaking, but they still hold up very well even in this CGI-effects laden era. I would contend that ILM's use of modeling and lighting in the old films actually lends a more believable look to the action scenes than the prequels' use of video-game style battles and sensory overload. There is great chemistry between the actor's - and while Luke is a bit annoying, the back and forth of Han and Chewbacca, and C-3PO and R2-D2, as well as Leia's chemistry with Han and Luke, make this movie extremely entertaining on an emotional level - it also makes you care about the characters. Let us compare the lightsaber duel of this movie with that from Phantom Menace. Although the acrobatics and sheer fury of the duel just are not there in A New Hope, we actually feel something when Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down. Conversely, when Qui-Gon Jinn is slain, there is not the same (if any) feeling after it is done. Well, I'm rambling now. But this movie has it all. Space battles, lightsaber duels (a la Samurai flicks), chase sequences, thinly veiled references to the Western genre in the Canteen on Tatooine. A Truly great adventure that, as it ended, was really just beginning.",

76,29 June 2021,nickenchuggets,10, May the force be with you. Always.,"Throughout the history of movies, maybe no other series has had a bigger impact on popular culture than Star Wars. The entire franchise is talked about more and praised more than I can even start to discuss. Before our current predicament (depending on how you look at it) with the franchise and George's decisions to ""remaster"" the movies and essentially downgrade them, there was the original film made back in the 70s. I'm not going to talk about any of the expanded universe things that Star Wars has in its lore because I just want to focus on this first movie for now. As expected, many people consider this one the best of all, although some might argue episode V is slightly better. I'm not going to debate any of that, but I will say that before this movie was released, things of its caliber were hardly dreamed of. Star Wars has such an unimaginable wealth of content to explore and talk about that it is almost as deep as our real universe, and it expands with each new movie that comes out. Of course, with such a huge amount of subjects to delve into, George Lucas had to start somewhere, and he chose to do something not many other movie makers would do. Star wars does obviously have a starting point, but not where you would expect it to be. The movie begins with a spaceship that belongs to a so called ""rebel alliance"" being closely pursued by a large class of spacegoing warship known as a star destroyer. Bristling with laser cannons and tractor beams, the star destroyer is able to give most rebel ships a run for their money. In this case, the rebel ship (called the Tantive IV) is trying to outrun the much more formidable Imperial one, presumably because it has important cargo. However, the rebel ship takes considerable damage and comes to a halt. The Rebel ship is pulled underneath the Imperial one, allowing the enemy to board it. Led by the ruthless Darth Vader, Rebel soldiers onboard are effortlessly swept aside. Meanwhile, Princess Leia Organa (one of the Rebel leaders) hides the aforementioned important secret cargo inside a droid named R2-D2. The cargo is very crucial to the story because it is the schematics to the Death Star, a gargantuan Imperial space station armed with a laser strong enough to annihilate an entire planet. After taking Leia hostage, Vader frantically tries to search the Rebel ship for the schematics, but R2 uses an escape pod to blast onto the desert planet of Tatooine with a protocol droid named C-3PO. The plans are out of Imperial hands (for now.) On the desert planet, R2 and C-3PO are captured by roaming travelers called Jawas who wear brown robes and have two yellow dots for eyes with no visible faces. The jawas offer to sell the droids to Owen Lars. Luke Skywalker, his nephew, lives with him. After the droids are in their possession, Luke comes across a holographic recording of Leia that says someone named ""Obi-Wan"" must help her. Luke later runs into Obi-Wan in the desert, who now lives in exile and is known as Ben Kenobi. Ben used to be a very powerful warrior who is able to use a magical presence called ""the Force"" to manipulate people and his surroundings. Not everyone can use it, and it takes a very long time to get good at. He tells Luke the warrior group he was a part of is called the Jedi Order, and Jedi use a special type of close-quarters weapon that is basically a beam of light projected from a metal hilt. These ""lightsabers"" are incredibly powerful and valuable weapons, and Luke obtains one from Obi-Wan. It apparently belonged to Luke's father, who was killed by Vader a long time ago. Later on, Luke and Obi-Wan must go to a cantina in the town of Mos Eisley to search for a spaceship that will enable them to take the death star plans to Leia's home planet. They come across Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his co-pilot Chewbacca. Together, they fly the Millennium Falcon; a fairly outmoded and obsolete spacecraft that isn't meant for fighting but can be useful in skilled hands. After taking off in the ship, they set out for Leia's homeworld, Alderaan, but not before Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) uses the Death Star's enormous superlaser to blow the planet to bits. Onboard the Falcon, the crew is now having second thoughts about going to Alderaan, and notice it isn't even there. They fly towards some object that resembles a moon, but upon getting closer, it's revealed to be the death star. The ship is powerless to fly away and the Death Star pulls them towards it with a tractor beam. Luke, Solo, and the others disguise themselves as Vader's soldiers (stormtroopers) and search the enormous Death Star for Princess Leia. Upon finding her, they attempt to escape, but find out that Kenobi has come face to face with Vader. His lightsaber battle with him buys the rest of the Rebels time to escape, but Vader kills Kenobi after he willingly deactivates his lightsaber. Regardless, the plans for the Death Star are secure which allows the Rebels to launch a huge assault on the space station with starfighters, one of them being piloted by Luke. The Death Star plans illustrate that the only way to destroy it is to use a proton torpedo to destroy its main reactor, causing a fatal chain reaction. In an attempt to stop Luke from achieving his goal, Vader chases him in his own starfighter, flanked by two TIE fighters. Luke only needs to hold out for a few more seconds to launch the torpedo, but Vader closes in on him fast. Right when all seems lost, Solo appears from out of nowhere in the Millennium Falcon and blasts Vader's ship off Luke's tail. Vader survives, but Luke is cleared to fire. The torpedo goes right down the reactor port and initiates the chain reaction process, which culminates in the entire Death Star exploding. The Rebel base on the nearby planet is spared a horrible demise, and the Rebels are saved. I don't think I need to say this, but I will anyway. This movie is awesome. The visuals, sound effects, special effects, sheer size of the locations, etc. Is still going to amaze people almost 50 years later, and I think everyone can agree the sound of a lightsaber is what makes Star Wars Star Wars. It deserves recognition both for what it is and for what it started. Even in this one movie alone, there is a huge amount of content and lore, but not much backstory. The first Star Wars movie begins in the middle of a galactic war, which makes the audience feel there's a lot of backstory that you didn't get to see. Thanks to the newer movies, we now know the things that came many years before (and after) the events of this one. It might seem obvious, but the characters are all great too. Luke is the classic hero archetype who has a great deal of responsibility on his shoulders, and with the threat of the Death Star looming, it makes the tension feel more dramatic. Although he doesn't appear much, Tarkin is one of the most disturbing characters because of his ability to kill millions at the push of a button and feel no remorse. Han Solo is not a hero in the traditional sense, but he cares about his crewmembers and would do anything to ensure their safety. Leia, while basically a damsel in distress for much of the movie, still displays a huge amount of defiance in the face of Vader's evil empire. Obi-Wan serves as the physically old master of the ways of the Force, and despite his aged appearance, he is very skilled and mentally powerful. Vader is probably the hardest to categorize because he is obviously the main bad guy, but the audience will still most likely pity him because of his dark past and insecurities. Obi-Wan says he used to be allies with him, but Vader became too interested in the dark side of the Force and lost his way. To summarize, I shouldn't have to state the obvious, but you really should watch this movie at least once. It is a mind-bendingly good start to one of the best movie series in history.",

I was merely a baby, from what I recall my parents telling me before their divorce. I wasn't even born when this first feature film hit theatres. I'm nineteen now, but I must admit that ""Star Wars"" was one of the many things that decorated my childhood. I always adored it, and always looked-up to Luke Skywalker. It was the type of view I can only assume all boys had; we all wanted to be a Luke Skywalker. We wanted to be the cool hero with a lightsaber. In this review, I will do my very best not to give you a biased review. However, forgive me, for I have always been a ""Star Wars"" fanatic. This was my first re-viewing in quite a while, so at least I'm reviewing the film with a clear set of eyes.",

It sets up not just the story at hand, but a whole world far, far away. What makes this movie shine are the memorable settings, characters and locations. The effects were ahead of its time, but have not aged well. This shows the most during fight scenes. They are not choreographed very well and look just like a couple of old dudes trying to punch each other with sticks. It's done so much better in the prequels, less so in the new movies. The lightsabers feel like a traditional novelty more than like a weapon feared by the galaxy. What the movie does very well are its twists and pacing. Highly recommended, but not nearly as good a watch today compared to the prequels, which you should start with in my opinion.",

A visually stunning and highly creative piece of artwork with one of the all-time great scores by John Williams. Some of the characters are brilliantly devised (not least the droids) and the landscapes and spacecraft are generally incredible. I cannot even imagine how astounding this would have been to innocent eyes back in 1977.",

But no matter how much money this franchise makes, or how many people see it, no matter how many sequels or prequels or re-releases or remasters it endures, the original classic still remains to be a very personal film. Despite the success it has undergone since its release, the production of ""Star Wars"" was a highly troubled one, many people expecting it to not even get completed at all. The hard work and dedication that Lucas and his cast and crew went through to get this thing made definitely shows through, and that makes the movie all the more endearing to watch. Quite simply, it's an incredible achievement in movie-making.",

Today, on Star Wars day, I figure it only fitting to review the film that started the whole starry craze, Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress! Nah, just kidding, it's Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope of course. It has been said countless times that Star Wars was based upon the Kurosawa samurai films as well as the Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s and 40s, but in my eyes, it's an all around fairy tale in space. Think about it, you've got the dashing, optimistic hero in Luke Skywalker, the wise, old mentor and hermit in Obi-Wan Kenobi, the damsel in distress mistress in Princess Leia, and the terrifying wizard with black attire in Darth Vader. It's like a Brothers Grimm tale or a tale written by L. Frank Baum, who you all know as the mind behind The Wizard of Oz. But what makes Star Wars great is something I can't sum up in one single review, but I'll certainly give it a try for your sake. This is 1977's Star Wars, the film that changed cinema forever. ",

To be perfectly honest, I considered turning off the movie at that point, ranking it a 1 on IMDb, and writing a harsh review. But about 5 minutes later, the film really picks up, coinciding with the first appearance of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). That's when the film becomes ""watchable"". It becomes entertaining as soon as Han Solo (Harrison Ford) appears.",
88,5 July 2007,stefanbe,10, The ultimate space adventure!,"I don't think there's any denying that Star Wars changed cinema history and deservedly so. At the time of its release, science-fiction was considered a dead genre with the only major films from Hollywood's recent cannon being the work from Stanley Kubrick and cheesy, yet still fun flicks like Logan's Run. Yet, no other futuristic movie wowed more than George Lucas's space opera. From that infamous opening scroll, featuring that amazing heart-pumping score, to the end credits, people were gripped and hoping their heroes that had grown to know those two previous hours could come out alive. While, George Lucas did give his Jedi knights more adventures, I don't think any of those sequels and certainly not the prequels have managed to come close to the original Star Wars that practically defined the baby boom generation. Watching the film again recently, I am still impressed by the awesome power of the movie and the fact that even after thirty years after its release, it gets me more excited than the latest Hollywood blockbuster. Sorry, Michael Bay, but you're no George Lucas, that's for certain.",

99,29 May 2005,mjsjsmith,10, The Movie that changed the way we make and look at movies,"This has been by far the greatest movie of all time. The special effects are very fantastic especially when the movie was made before I was even born, even Return of the Jedi was made 7 years before I was born, or should I say it was completed 7 years before I was born. It's like George Lucas who's the Director for all the Star Wars movies including Episode III- Revenge of the Sith, it's like he went back in time a long time ago and he traveled to a galaxy far, far away. I must say George Lucas, I am very impressed. This probably did all happen a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. I just can't believe it, I mean how did he do it, this film is just ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. George Lucas can make any kind of movie he wants. He can even make a movie about what happens far before Star Wars Episode I- The Phantom Menace and he can even make a movie about what happens far after Star Wars Episode VI- Return of the Jedi. So George Lucas I have been a huge fan of Star Wars since I saw Episode IV when I was 5 and I'll be honest, I didn't really understand the storyline because I was only 5. But I was just amazed on the Special Effects, it was incredible for it's time, 1977. And when I turned 7 my mother bought the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition and it was even better with all new Advanced Digital Technology and I started to understand the storyline a lot better. And when I turned 14 I bought the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD and it got much better with one of the best pictures I have ever seen in a movie. But the Number 1 thing I hated about the DVD was that in Return of the Jedi at the very end of the movie you see the ghosts of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and Anakin Skywalker. I hated the fact that in the DVD you replaced Anakin Skywalker's ghost with the Anakin Skywalker from Episode II and Episode III. You shouldn't have done that George. It's great you re-modified the Trilogy and all with new technology but don't destroy the plot, because not even Luke Skywalker is going to have no idea who that person is, and you didn't make Obi-Wan Kenobi look like Ewan McGregor so I don't see why you did that. George try to re-modify Return of the Jedi that way it was before, the face that Luke Skywalker saw him as when he took off that black mask and helmet that Anakin Skywalker needs to live. Alright. That's all I have to say.",

A harbinger of a changing mood within the United States, Star Wars was one of the few movies rated General that was released in 1977. Where movies had for a decade been depicting ever more dark topics (Taxi Driver, The Exorcist) Star Wars was a lighthearted adventure.  While some may decry the move back to swashbuckling from social comment, I for one celebrate the fact that Star Wars made it possible for families to go to movies together once again.",

Here you have a walking tyrant named Darth Vader, a human iron lung who has a strong craving for power. He uses the mystical power known as The Force to get get anything in his will. The Force choke is wicked! Then you have Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill), a simple farm boy who wants to go to the academy, then he and his uncle purchased some droids that have some important information to an old Jedi named Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi(Alec Guinness), who has kept a light-saber from his old student Anakin Skywalker(Darth Vader). I liked the scene where Luke, Han Solo(Harrison Ford), and Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew) took out the StormTroopers. Then there's the Death Star battle. A real gem. When they showed the extra scenes later in the years, it's worth the watch even more!

With ""Episode III"" still raking in sold-out crowds six weeks after its release, Lucas is pretty much on top of the world. But what about the film that started it all, ""Star Wars"" (1977)? What's left to say about it? Every good thing that has and can be said about it has been said already, ever since it debuted in the summer of '77 and changed the way we looked at movies, and the way people made them. ""Star Wars"" is sheer imagination run amok, taking place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, with farmboy Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) discovering the two droids C-3PO and R2-D2, the latter droid of which contains a holographic image of a distress call from Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). The Princess is being held captive by Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) and his fearsome military commander Darth Vader (played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones), the dark lord of the Sith, on the newly constructed Death Star battle station. Skywalker, taking advantage of an opportunity to leave behind boring farm life, seeks out the mysterious Obi Wan Kenobi (the late Alec Guiness, in an Oscar-nominated performance) and the two journey to a Mos Eisley watering hole to enlist the aid of swashbuckling space pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford), pilot of the Millennium Falcon, and his Wookie sidekick Chewbacca - their adventures resulting in them joining the Rebel Alliance - culminating in one of the greatest screen battles, which is the Rebel assault on the Death Star at the film's climatic conclusion. Lucas brought forth this ambitious vision to stunning reviews and a devoted fanbase that has established ""Star Wars"" as a subculture within pop culture. It's impossible to call this film dated in any fashion, given that Lucas often had to resort to imagination to get things done on this project since budget constraints allowed for such creativity. When I saw ""Star Wars"" for the first time when I was kid, it took my breath away, as I'm sure it did to everyone else that saw it for the first time. That initial viewing sticks with you, and as a result the film never looses its impact. ""Star Wars"" was of course followed by the somber ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) and the triumphant ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983), both of which are also considered classics in themselves. And with the prequel trilogy (1999's ""The Phantom Menace,"" 2002's ""Attack of the Clones,"" the aforementioned 2005 conclusion ""Revenge of the Sith"") out of the way, there is word out that Lucas isn't done with ""Star Wars,"" and may be looking to start a new trilogy.

It was summer and my family was spending a month at our camp. One day my sister (2 years old at the time) and I had been fighting all day. My parents sent us off to bed for a nap before dinner and I grudgingly complied. I was awoken by my father, he was asking me if I wanted to go see a movie. ""It has spaceships, and robots, and lasers, you'll love it!"" I looked at him through swollen eyes and asked, ""does Jenna get to go to?"" When I heard him say no, I knew I was in for a HUGE treat. We arrived at a nearly empty theater, and took our seats. When the first jarring chord of the theme hit me, and my father began reading the opening story, I was captivated. It was the happiest day of my life. To hell with all your nitpicking. When something makes that great an impression on a four year old, you know it has to be something truly special. By the way, I'm wearing the Boba Fett t-shirt my son's mother gave me as a gift. And no, I'm not some greasy, Star Wars obsessed dork. Well, not any more...",

Ever since I was 5 I've loved this movie and I have never tired of it's story and excellent special effects. This movie was well ahead of its time and was a true trend setter as is evident by how many movies after Star Wars have taken from it. It was masterfully written and directed with a great story to go with even more magnificent special effects. This movie was all inclusive for every movie goer: there was the science fiction part of it with glimpses of the future not too far from reality. There was the tale of good versus evil and even a sub-plot of religious versus irreligious with those who believed in the ""Force"" and those who didn't. And there was even a bit of chivalry with the rescue of the damsel in distress, Princess Leia. The characters were intriguing and all had their niche in the movie. Ultimately, how could you not like the movie that gave birth to Darth Vader, arguably the most notorious screen villain ever. This is just an epic saga which I can't say enough about.",

The story revolves around young Luke Skywalker, a farm boy who wants more adventure in his life. Adventure finally arrives to him in the form of two droids, sent by Princess Leia, a beautiful woman begging someone named Obi-Wan Kenobi for help. Leia is a huge part of Rebel Alliance, a group of people determined to stop the Empire's reign of terror and evil. When Luke meets up with Obi-Wan, they set out to deliver plans inside the droid to Leia's father, plans that can stop the most destructive weapon ever from destroying any planet that stands up for good. Teaming up with a cocky pilot who is more caring than he lets on named Han Solo and his CoPilot Chewbacca (big dog/ape/bigfoot like creature) the heroes are thrust into adventure beyond Luke's wildest dreams, complete with a heroine, henchmen, space ships, battles and the most menacing villain a movie has ever seen.",

Without going into too much detail on the other films of the original trilogy, Star Wars may actually be the best of the three just because of its simplicity. Sure Empire takes it to a deeper level, but Star Wars is just the simple and relatable fable of Dorothy on her farm, wishing for a greater existence in life, however in Star Wars our Dorothy is Luke Skywalker, searching for his own purpose in life.

The credits were followed by dozens of special effects never before seen on the big screen as oohs and ahs continued for the next two hours, non-stop. At the end of the film, everyone rose to give the movie a standing ovation that lasted over a minute. It was an exhilarating experience. Fascinating characters were introduced one by one, Luke, Hans Solo, Princess Leia, Obiwan Kanobi, and of course, Darth Vader. The robots were funny as well. Introducing and fleshing out two or three characters is tough enough, but this film took on at least five major characters and several minor ones.

""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" the universe in ruled in fear by the Empire, and a new threat has been completed, the Death Star battle station. The rebels however have managed to capture the plans for the station, and Senator Princess Leia Organa (introducing Carrie Fisher) places them into the memory of droid R2-D2 (Kenny Baker). R2 with companion droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) escape the ship and land the desert world Tatooine, the Princess meanwhile is held captive by the Emperor's trusted servant Darth Vader (acted by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) and battle station leader Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing). R2 and 3PO meanwhile eventually end up with farm boy Luke Skywalker (introducing Mark Hamill) who lives on the planet with his Aunt and Uncle. While cleaning R2, he comes across the message from the Princess, mentioning Obi-Won Kenobi (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sir Alec Guinness), an former Jedi Knight who they find in the desert. After his relatives are killed, Luke wants to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi. They contract pilots of the Millennium Falcon, Han Solo (introducing Harrison Ford) and Wookie Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) to take them across the galaxy at light speeds. They travel to what was the Princess's planet, Alderaan, but they are pulled in by tracker beam by what destroyed it, the Death Star. After avoiding the stormtroopers, and rescuing the Princess, they eventually escape after removing the beam, but Obi-Won was killed (and became one with the Force) after being killed by his former pupil, Vader. The concluding scenes are the craft and laser battles with the Rebels and the Empire, Darth Vader escapes (giving way to the sequel), and Luke eventually blows up the Death Star (with a great explosion), and the heroes are rewarded, a happy ending.

156,29 December 1998,BigHands,10, Masterpiece in disguise,"Some claim that Star Wars is nothing more than a simple morality tale that borrowed from classic mythology with good special effects.  Comments have been made about the film that it has a simple story and that the movie has simple characters.  While all of these claims may have some validity, to say that the film has no depth is unfair.  When one studies how much thought really was put in Lucas' trilogy, they should be amazed. While the film borrows from mythology, Lucas has made sure that each film has a major twist from its ancestors.  In the first film for example, Luke goes to rescue a princess, but instead she is the one that ends up saving him. Not only does the story telling have a twist on classic mythology, it has an underlying theme and many sub-themes that no other movie can match. After studying the trilogy, redemption is the theme most often explored. Every major ""good"" character in the trilogy at one time falls and then redeems himself. The ultimate redemption being Darth Vader who will be the main character in the new trilogy being developed as I type. As for the characters being simple, this seems unfair.  They are archtypes.  Characters common throughout all cultures.  Also, all the major characters have motivation for their actions unlike most good guy/bad guy movies.  The bad guys in the films are bad because of human flaws such as the struggle for power and greed.  They are not simple bad for bad's sake. Even the main villain of the trilogy becomes very human by the end of the trilogy when he redeems himself.  The film doesn't show the bad guys only as something to shoot at, but as human beings that have been lead astray.  The two trilogies are ultimately about how a human being can become a monster, and that a monster is still a human being in the end. The Star Wars trilogy has more depth than at first glance.

179,18 October 2017,gab-14712,9, The Birth of a Cultural Revolution!,"A cultural revolution. That is what perfectly describes Star Wars: A New Hope. Movie historians have longed said that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas gave cinema a rebirth. The early 70's were a period for American and art-house films, but these two men allowed movies to become fun again. According to Lucas, who created THX-1138 and American Graffiti, the purpose for this movie was just for movies to become fun again. What he did for cinema today, well we have this man to thank for it. This small low-budget sci-fi film spawned six more movies with many more to come. Star Wars has now spread across three generations, three generations of love. I love hearing stories from people who saw this when it came out in 1977. They tell me how much this cultural phenomenon impacted their lives. My father is a mega Star Wars fan, and it's safe to say this is one of his favorite movies. How could such a small movie impact the movie business the way it did? Well, it helps that it's a fabulous movie. The movie features an iconic villain named Darth Vader who is known for his deep breathing noises. We have two incredibly memorable heroes in Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. The two most famous robots in movie history are C-3PO and R2-D2. We have everyone's favorite scoundrel in Han Solo, the pilot of the Millennium Falcon and his favorite sidekick Chewbacca, a bear-like Wookiee. So what I'm trying to stay here, is the film has instantly memorable characters. This film pushed new ground with visual effects. Luca's own company, Industrial Light & Magic worked very hard in creating never-before-seen effects from the humming of the lightsabers to the robotic language of R2-D2. The film looks impressive for a 1977 feature, and that could have attracted scores of people. Most of all, this is a fun movie. ",

With the new trilogy, Lucas proves once and for all that he himself doesn't even understand what was good about the original movies. The original Star Wars movies are cool because they create a convincing, alien culture. Everything looks used, rugged and thousands of years old! It's believable as the surroundings of a five-thousand year-old and truly alien culture. It creates a timeless impression.",

The thing that allows Star Wars to really get under your skin and have such a powerful and lasting effect on you lies in the combination of its simplicity and complexity. It is no secret that the vast majority of film plots revolve around some version of the ancient `good vs. evil' storytelling structure, and Episode IV is probably the most widely given example of this. The original Star Wars is a shockingly simple presentation of this structure, but it is also an immensely enlarged version of it. Lucas uses good vs. evil to structure his plot, but at the same time, he adds a story that entails such a level of complexity that it is impossible to reduce the film to a tired exercise of an age-old story structure.",

I remember watching this film for the first time when I was five and it was epic. The characters were amazing, the visual effects were great, and the whole plot which is so original is god damn perfect. George Lucas brought so many genres into this film that it's amazing how it doesn't mess things up and keeps the story simple, intimidating and interesting. It's like combining so many colors until you come up with a new color. And of course in this film we are introduced to the most famous and terrifying villain of all time - Darth Vader!

Over time, of course, the initial ""Oh wow!"" factor wears off and it becomes just another sci-fi movie. But it really shouldn't-- this is *the* sci-fi movie. That is not to say it is the best of the entire genre-- I really don't think it is, but this was where everything changed for the last time (other major genre changes occurred in 1968's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Planet of the Apes""). The photography and editing combine very well, making it flow better than almost any film the '70s ever produced. Harrison Ford (Han Solo) and Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) have a great, well-realized, almost love/hate relationship. But the real star of the movie is Darth Vader-- that gigantic black-suited, raspy, evil mastermind who brings new meaning to the word ""power"". This is not only because of James Earl Jones' fantastic voice-over, but also because of David Prowse's physical presence on the celluloid. The movie's vulnerable point comes in the sweeping, epic style, which very nearly overdoes itself on numerous occasions. However, ""Star Wars"" is a classic, even though it cannot really be considered the best of anything. And a word to the wise-- watch the 1977 original.

This movie can prove that I am a complete science fiction freak. Farm boy Luke Skywalker has been asked to protect Princess Leia from the evil clutches of Darth Vader, and the Death Star station. Along the way, he is joined by uncle Obi-Wan Kenobi, the greedy Han Solo and his trusted companion Chewbacca, and two droids named R2-D2 and C3-PO. Throughout the movie, it's a stunning journey that beat the odds of cinema. ""Star Wars"" is one of those epic science-fiction flicks where you already know that you will enjoy it in the end. Let me just say that once those flying credits through the galaxy in the beginning are finished, you are in for a treat. I enjoy everything about this spectacular piece of work. The casting of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness, and Carrie Fisher was quite excellent. Even the characters of Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C3-P0 seem so memorable. George Lucas delivers an incredible directing job, and brought a lot of his unique imagination to the screen. John William's breathtaking score blew me away, the visual effects are astounding and it puts you into the action, the sound is sense-tickling, the editing is pure genius, the costumes are well unique, and the art direction feels so imaginative. This is one of those movies where it can let you escape the real world, and send you into a world like no other. So, if you are a fan of science fiction, and you enjoy watching George Lucas flicks, then ""Star Wars"" is the movie for you! ""Star Wars"", in my review, ""one of the most imaginable science-fiction movies ever made"".",
225,3 May 2016,tankace,10, A landmark of the cinema-history,"In honor of May,the official Star Wars month, I will review all the Star Wars movies in chronological order. Now lets start with the New Hope: It opened on May 1977 and after that the world as a whole changed big time. This movie is even studied as the archetype of the hero journey and made the words like ,lightsabers, the Force, Jedi and names like Lya ,Luke , Han Solo and of course Darth Vader known world wide.Every science fiction flick or TV series after 1977 is in, one way or an order, a child ,godchild or imitator of Star Wars. From Guardians of the Galaxy to Rick and Morty and almost anything in between. The impact can be seen in movies or series from totally different genres, for instance due to its success studios decided to invest in the superhero stories that inspire George Lucas to create this unforgettable saga and from that it came Richard Donner's Superman ,Tim Burton's Batman and the 1992 X-men series and Batman the animated series ,which are the fathers (spoilers) of the superhero genre ,which now dominates Hollywood. In simple ,no Star Wars, no Superheroes!! If you have not watch it ,I feel sorry for you and go do it now!!",
226,22 May 2005,LaBelleAurore,8, The Ultimate Modern Fairy Tale,"This film single-handedly changed modern cinema to what we know it to be today. It is the ultimate modern fairy tale. A young knight runs off with a wise old wizard to save the princess from the clutches of evil. Of course, it runs a little deeper than that, and makes the old tale of good versus evil so much more compelling. Setting it long ago in a galaxy far, far away is pure genius and it introduces us to a futuristic galaxy of beautiful style and diversity that leaves us with a fantastic space opera. Despite its unfamiliar setting, we can relate to all the characters. There's the handsome maverick, the beautiful heroine, the aspiring young knight, the wise old mentor, and the darkly clad villain. Even the droids are characters we can recognise and relate to. What is so special about this film is that the distractions of things like politics, geography, and nationality are eliminated to leave us with simple humanity. This film has everything you could ever want. The characters are great; the action's great; the story is magnificent, and of course there's philosophy too.... Oh, what am I talking about? I just think lightsabers are cool...",

Now on to the review: Star Wars is hands down the best clash of good and evil any person can find in movies ever. For those who haven't seen it, and shame if you haven't, this one kicks off in the middle of a war in space between the Emperor and the Rebels. Luke lives on a desert planet and longs to join the rebellion, but can't because his Uncle Ben doesn't want him to. Shortly into the movie the family purchases some droids and Luke soon finds a message hidden in R2D2's data for an Obi Wan Kenobi. Things kick into gear once Luke follows the droid to Kenobi's house and thus begins the adventure. Obi Wan believes that Luke can turn out to be a Jedi just like his father was and takes him under his wing teaching him the way of the Force once they get off Tattooin. During the movie you'll run into the memorable characters like the evil Darth Vader, the cocky Han Solo, Chewy the Wookie, and Princess Leia. Hands down episodes 4-6 are the best trilogy ever created. See it now if you haven't already.",

It was all great fun but of course no one in the world could have predicted the entertainment phenomenon this franchise would become. In fact, Star Wars was just a one-and-done intention until its massive popularity fueled the making of TESB. (When the opening credits of the sequel rolled starting with ""Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"", it was electrifying: everyone looked at each other saying 'What?? this is episode five? what are 1, 2, and 3?"" and Lucas's grand plan was off and running.

This was full color with incredible computer generated graphics. There were real live BELIEVABLE aliens up on the screen! We were flying at light speed across galaxies and star systems! And then the movie was over, the house lights came up, and we had to WALK on CONCRETE to our FOSSIL FUELED vehicles and DRIVE on ASPHALT to get home. How B-O-R-I-N-G. How mundane. I had just seen the future, and then when I left the theater it was all jerked away from me. I'll never forget that feeling. The disappointment of ""reality"".

Obviously, I was born in 2002 and know this film by it's retroactive title, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. But, like many people who have already reviewed this film, this film has had a huge impact on me in many ways. To be honest, as of the time that I wrote this review, the viewing was the first time in a couple of years. Star Wars was released in 1977 and was a surprise hit as nobody had much faith in the project to begin with. The film was such a success that, for a short time, it was the highest grossing film of all time. Critics loved the film upon release and even went on to win some Oscars. The film stars Mark Hamill, the late Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and much more. The film was popular enough that a sequel and an eventual series was made.",

The special effects were still good, not as impressive as Episode 1 but for the time, they were excellent.  What is weird is that in basic terms Star Wars is just a good vs evil story, but its the way its done with all the other elements interwoven that make it so good.

How do you review it? One of the few ways to actually read balanced reviews of it is to look at what the critics said when it was originally released, thirty-two years ago. At the time, unlike now, where most ""serious"" movie critics treat it with contempt, they liked it. Roger Ebert called the film ""an out-of-body experience,"" and Vincent Canby called the film ""the movie that's going to entertain a lot of contemporary folk who have a soft spot for the virtually ritualized manners of comic-book adventure."" These reviews show us, that at the time, just about everybody (Pauline Kael, Jonathan Rosenbaum and Stanley Kauffmann excepted) agreed that ""Star Wars"" was a great film.

It's also the film that revolutionized the sci-fi category, making all sci-fi films that came after it more realistic and better because of the technology that is used in the films because of Star Wars. Industrial Light and Magic was created that headed the department of technology advancements. Skywalker Sound headed the way in the advancements of film sounds, and George Lucas became a titan in the film industry!! Now on to the movie!! Star Wars simply came out at time in America when we needed it the most. The Vietnam War was wrapping up & Americans needed distraction and something positive to believe in again. Enter Star Wars, a story about a farm boy who it turns out is actually a Prince that joins a ragtag bunch of Rebels that destroys an Evil Empire with the help of a scoundrel-like friend & his good natured dog-like buddy and his Princess sister. A bit far fetched - yes, filled with a bunch of morals that the youth of this nation and other nations around the world needed at the time. As George Lucas has been quoted, it's been very important to him that his movies give youngsters hope, and while we no longer have the tail end of the Vietnam War waging on today Star Wars still brings me and others hope today!! Now to the nitty gritty. The acting. It's good, remember for the most part these are first couple performances minus Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford). The action is s very good, the special effects - for the time - were outstanding. The sound editing is very good, the soundtrack is great done by genius and legend John Williams, the writing and direction is out of this world by George Lucas.

I do not, like many, consider this to be the best film ever made. Further more I don't even consider it the best science fiction film ever made and I do not even consider it to be the best Star Wars film ever made (that distinction, in my opinion, belongs to The Empire Strikes Back). However, there is no denying that this is one of the most enjoyable blockbusters from Hollywood ever made. Setting in stone the foundations that blockbusters need, such as a high number of special effects, action sequences, a bunch of heroes and a good looking female lead, George Lucas has not created a work of art, but he has created one of the most perfect examples of what can be done in Hollywood. A hugely enjoyable adventure that amazes the eyes and senses. There's no point saying that the acting and script are great because they aren't. While Alec Guinness, Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones are fantastic, don't get me wrong, there isn't really anything here that could be considered award worthy, but that's not the point here. This is a film that will leave with a smile on your face for the simple reason that this is a blockbuster that is exciting, emotional and at its heart simple.

I sat there, before the flickering screen, enveloped in ""Star Wars'"" suffocating stupidity, wondering how in the hell I could ever have liked this thing. I finally came to my senses and turned the channel after hearing John Williams' irritating ""Darth Vader"" theme for the 600th time in the first 40 minutes. Why George Lucas decided we needed to hear this high-volume musical cue EVERY time we see Darth Vader on screen is beyond me.  Maybe he just thinks his audience is extremely stupid and is incapable of remembering that Darth Vader is supposed to be evil.  I don't know...",

I just watched them again in Blu-ray and some of the old excitement is gone. I guess almost 15 years of becoming familiar with great directors and great movies and also with Sci-Fi/Fantasy works done before 1977 have made me unable to close eyes to what is wrong with Star Wars. Though the movie is still a fantastic entertainment in a childish way, it has some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in a screen ‚Äìbig or small- and terrible acting. Luke Skywalker is the archetypical hero and the character has great potential. However, Mr. Hamill wasn't skilled or talented enough to flesh out the character as it was written paper thin. As result, poor Luke is just a whining teenager. Harrison Ford fares much better as the rogue space cowboy because he was a very charismatic person not because he was the best of actors. Carrie Fisher is equally flat as princess Leia. Only Peter Cushing saves the day with decent acting as well as the powerful voice of Mr. Jones. The direction is mediocre but serviceable. The soundtrack sounds better than ever in its Wagnerian intensity and use of motifs. Watch it for old time's sake. Luckily, Empire Strikes back holds the passing of time much better.",

308,4 July 2008,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, The Force *is* strong in this one... it's loved for a reason,"I think what makes this so rightfully popular is that it has something for everyone. It's fun, exciting, epic, with strong characters and clever lines. It manages to integrate all of the elements without anything feeling like it was just stuck in there, and doesn't talk down to anyone. There's no upper or lower age limit on enjoying this or taking it in. If you've got eyes and ears and you have spirit, you're likely to find at least one thing to care for in this, as well as be entertained. The plot is well-written and develops throughout. The pacing is pretty much spot-on, the movie never overwhelms or stands still. There are so many fantastic worlds, vehicles, creatures, languages and designs in the universe that this was the first look into, and it's clear that a lot of care and creativity was the basis for it. Also worth noting is the fact that this could easily be the only Star Wars to be made... it's self-contained, and had no others been done, this would still be a satisfying full story, albeit there would undoubtedly be a vocal demand for more. The action is entertaining and well-done, and certainly intense. The special effects broke new ground, actually inventing techniques for this. Some are dated, though new releases cover much up with CGI(but not to the point of it being obnoxious, or, really, particularly bothersome at all). The scope is amazing, and Lucas somehow pulled it off. The acting varies, but it's never too poor. My fianc√©e points out that Ford does seem a tad young, considering one of the main personality traits of who he portrays. The cinematography and editing are both top-notch. The score by John Williams is incredible. The sound is unique and aids in the setting of distant planets. There is a little violence, and some disturbing visuals. The DVD holds a commentary track which makes for a good listen. I recommend this to any fan of George Lucas, adventure, science fiction and the medium of film. 10/10",

However, I do like this film, it's just that it is so full of clich√©s that one more clich√© would've made it a very silly film. As it is now, it's not silly, it's a good film for kids. I don't say that to try to put the film down, there's nothing wrong with children's films. Look at the best Disney films for example! Some of them are masterpieces. And I really like fantasy films like ""Star Wars"" even if I think that e.g. ""Time Bandits"" is a better film. Having said that, there is nothing really wrong with ""Star Wars"", it's good entertainment. It's rather funny (I like interplay between R2-D2 and C-3PO) and apart from the clich√©s (though they are overwhelming) it is a rather nice story -- for kids. Not being a child I do demand much more from a film's script than this, but I was still very entertained while I watched ""Star Wars"" and my vote for it here at IMDb was a 6 (out of 10).",

I don't understand why Obiwan is considered a crazy hermit, when the uncle knew him to be a Jedi knight. I still don't get the flashing lights and buttons on Darth's chest, why didn't Obiwan just use his force powers to switch off the power on the jump suit. Also it is supposed to be about twenty years from episode 3 to episode 4 but Obiwan ages like 40 years. Whats up with that? That whole suicide by Vader thing is incredibly lame, too.

327,16 June 2010,jzappa,8, The Movie That Ate Hollywood,"The irony of George Lucas' career is that he started out making experimental avant-garde short films and became, not always of his own volition, the closest thing the modern film industry has to an authentic classic mogul. His key problem had always been his inhibiting bashfulness when dealing with people. However, his strongest distinction has always been his shrewdness. Fans of Lucas see his sovereign autonomy as a significant countermeasure to the supreme control of Hollywood, his idealized enterprise to spend (and make) his own money on new innovations and projects that have benefited the rest of the industry as something to be commended. Dissenters, nevertheless, lose hope in what they perceive as a dominating juvenilization of the American film industry in the wake of Star Wars---the watershed that proved that Jaws and Close Encounters were no flukes but the real thing---holding Lucas and Spielberg specially accountable for the gaudy spin-off merchandise-driven summer-blockbuster mentality that has steered the business for the past three decades.",
328,23 January 2016,darioilg,8, The one movie that changed it all,"Oh, boy. Reviewing a film that so many critics have been writing about is so hard, but also deserves a try for sure. The original Star Wars is not that kind of movie you love because it's so well made or so complex and deep; you love it because it makes you happy. George Lucas back in the day didn't want to create the perfect sci-fi movie (he says so in a Rolling Stones review), as that was ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" in his opinion; he wanted to make something special in its lightness, a space opera not focusing on space (as did its future rival, Star Trek), but on a very, very simple story of a rescue (and later on in the saga, a family). Each character is just perfect in his role: Luke, the hero, with his strong sense of duty; Han Solo, the roughneck, a guy whose role in the universe is not yet written but soon will be; Princess Leia, a role model for girls at a time when a woman leading a group of adventurers was just fantasy. And this is just the main squad. I won't dwell on the amazing comedic commentary by the two droids (one of which, without a single word, became the favorite character of many fans!), the ominous figure of the mysterious Darth Vader and the mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, with the delicate role of introducing us to the mystical side of this world, the Force. No movie is perfect for me, and in this case I'll have to state the one, unimportant flaw in the whole original trilogy: the acting in itself isn't great and some points of the plot are off. That said, the chemistry between the actors is palpable and the story is so funny, you don't need to stress every aspect of it.",
329,12 December 2019,davidmvining,10, Still great after all these years,It's amazing how this movie still works as well as it does. I think there are two main components to the original Star Wars's success as a film. The first is Lucas' embrace of Joseph Campbell's model of mythic storytelling. He utilizes the archetypes Campbell built so cleanly and the narrative structure so clearly that the core story of the film resonates easily with audiences. The second is how the story gets integrated into the largely implied larger universe of Star Wars.,

I highly recommend this movie to the five people in the universe that have not seen it yet. 25 years later, and it is still, and will forever be, a classic. 10 of 10",
331,1 December 2020,AW_McGOWAN,9, Humble Origins For A Cinematic Legend,"Few movies capture the imagination as the original ""Star Wars"" does, and because of its vast legacy, it is rather challenging to review in isolation. Part of the wonder of watching George Lucas' initial space opera today is knowing what it leads to and appreciating how this low-budget sci-fi movie from the late seventies changed the face of cinema forever.",
332,23 November 2019,CubsandCulture,7, The start is fun but rough. Lucas is an idea guy,"A New Hope has the distinction of being the first Star Wars film and I think a lot of people overrate the film as a result. It is a wonderful film, on the whole and the Star War franchise is a cornerstone of American culture. But ANH is not without its problems. The start of the story is needlessly convoluted and overextended by about 15 minutes. There simply is not a reason-for theme, character, plot or world-to separate R2D2 and C3PO only to have them reunited 10 minutes later. Indeed the film has about 20 minutes of fat that could have been tightened up on the page. This is hardly surprising as Lucas is a weaker writer. It is not enough to ruin the film or anything but the writing is not crisp.",
333,10 August 2004,Marshtacular,10, Mixed feelings about the DVD,"Doesn't it drive you crazy that George Lucas is only releasing the special editions of the original Star Wars movies? I've been looking forward to these DVDs since DVDs began, and boy, hasn't George Lucas made us wait? Star Wars used to be the greatest movie ever made. Not good enough for George. He had to fancy it up with computer generated bits and pieces that, like plastic surgery on a beautiful woman, only served to fake it up. It used to be chunky and real. You felt like you could reach out and touch the spaceships. Like you could really smell the Wookie. But now it's just another Lucasfilm cartoon. At best, a trailer for the current unholy trilogy. I want my Star Wars back. My old reliable beloved Star Wars. Where is it George? Why isn't it on DVD? I'm hardly alone in my feelings here. Star Wars has a massive fan base but how come it's been so roundly ignored? Surely everyone wants the original versions. At the very least, the option to watch the original versions on the special edition disks. That would be great. Maybe Lucas is going to make us pay for the special editions and then, in a few years time, release the originals and shake us down some more. He knows we'll pay, and money does appear to be the only thing he cares about. When George was young he was like Luke Skywalker, then for a while he was Obi Wan but now he's forever Jabba, vile gangster and ravager of fans. Thanks. I had to get that off my chest. Please everyone, let me know how you feel about this. Should I just chill out or should we organise a march on the Skywalker Ranch? FREE STAR WARS NOW!",

If you want to avoid that, click out. Anyways, this movie was a landmark when it first came out. It was one of the only sci-fi movies released that doesn't have an alien invasion as the focus. This movie is engagingly original and feels very inspired. It also feels very 80's but in a good way. The effects still hold up very well. Maybe that's because the effects keep being updated but my point still stands. The space scenes are still impressive and are still a lot of fun to watch. The lightsaber duels on the other hand, are pretty weak. Even one of the most intense scenes in the movie: the lightsaber duel between Obi Wan and Darth Vader, let's face it, is just two guys tapping lit-up swords. It's still an intense scene so it doesn't bother me that much but compared to the action scenes in the other Star Wars films, it's really underwhelming. Me and my brother used to joke about that. The story might be a bit clich√© by today's standards as a classic underdog story but do I care? No because all the new ideas here are just so interesting and awesome! The characters in this movie are all iconic. Darth Vader was cool in this movie until the stupid prequels came out, but other than that, all the characters are awesome!

I even go so far and say that if I hadn't been encouraged by over 1000 people that I would probably have only seen one star wars film voluntarily to date.
Of course, the weapon technology, the character design, and the costume design are so multifaceted and gigantic that it was not without reason that whole lexicons were filled with them, but I have to say that as a film it just doesn't really tell me it was not boring, but it's nothing what I would ever watch again voluntarily.

348,6 February 2002,poe426,6," ""The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded...""- George Lucas","The studio dismissal of his first (and, arguably, best) film, THX-1138, and the phenomenal success of his second feature, AMERICAN GRAFFITI, led George Lucas to undertake an Americanized version of Akira Kurosawa's THE HIDDEN FORTRESS- by way of the old FLASH GORDON and BUCK ROGERS serials. Replacing the two flesh and blood leads from THE HIDDEN FORTRESS with a pair of robots who might well have stepped straight from Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, Lucas fashioned a kiddie corn classic. Luke Skywalker, one supposes, is the young Lucas himself (whose interest in fast-moving machines nearly cost him the farm in his misspent youth). Forgettable in many ways, but nonetheless entertaining, STAR WARS has become the backbone of big-budget fx filmmaking in this country. One can't begrudge Lucas his phenomenal success, but one tends to find oneself longing for a return to the old, inventive days when he made movies with a tad more substance- movies that didn't follow the selfsame beat, frame after frame...",

353,18 February 2006,jimbo700,10, Bar None... The greatest motion picture ever filmed!!!,"I drove 50 miles to see this film on opening day during the summer of 1977. I saw it several times in it's original theatrical run, then I saw it a couple of times on each subsequent re-release. The last time I watched Star Wars in a theater (excluding the 1997 special edition) was in 1985 at a drive-in theater. In 8 years... the total number of visits I made to the big-screen to see Star Wars ... 21. There are two or three things that make Star Wars the best movie ever made. First, there were those incredible special effects. Special effects are not a big deal any more. Last summer I saw ""War Of The Worlds"" and, while I enjoyed the movie, I wasn't that impressed as the aliens blasted people out of their clothes and annihilated the bridge next to Tom Cruise's home. I've seen movies in the past few years in which the main star of the movie doesn't exist, except in the mind of the creator and in a computer. Anything a writer/producer/director can possibly imagine can be stunningly rendered on the screen using CGI. Such was not the case in 1977. As the camera paned down to the surface of Tatooine after the opening crawl, showing Vader's ship closing in on Princess Leia's ship, it was breathtaking... Like standing on the edge of the Grand Canyon. No one had ever done anything like this before. Star Wars was first and foremost a special effects movie. Second, the story. Our world was in turmoil throughout the 70's. The Soviet Union was at the top of their game. The US was torn and devastated by the Vietnam war. A President resigned in disgrace. Inflation was killing the financial future of the working man. We waited in line to buy gas. Americans were being held hostage in Iran. Hollywood was cranking out great movies. The Godfather, Cuckoo's Nest, Taxi Driver, Apocalypse Now and Chinatown were the top movies of the 70's. Some of the best movies ever made, but notice that all of them are somewhat dark. Godfather is a bloodbath and the ending shows evil winning out over Michael Corleone's soul. In Cuckoo's Nest our hero enters an institution a fun-loving goof ball and suffers a terrible death. Taxi Driver is about darkness and evil pushing a man into insanity. I could go on.. Even those famous disaster flicks of the 70's consider it a happy ending if 6 people out of 1000 survive (Poseidon Adventure). Star Wars gave us a good old fashioned battle between good and evil... and good prevailed. Sure, we felt loss when Vader struck down Obi Wan, but Obi Wan's spirit continued through out the rest of the movie as if his death didn't occur. At the end, after an emotional battle and a bit of a twist, with great ceremony, the hero's are honored and the closing credits roll to John William's majestic score. In 1977, there were very few movies you walked out of, feeling like you had lived a fantasy, feeling like you were there. But I was in that auditorium when Leia placed those medals on Luke and Han's neck. I wanted that feeling over and over and that's why I saw it every chance I got. In the early 80's I paid $150 for a bootleg VHS video, shot right off the screen of a theater, complete with washed out color and the flicker caused by the different frame rates of TV and motion pictures. When Star Wars was first released on video, the price for a VHS cassette was over a hundred dollars and I purchased it then. I purchased it again when it became available on Laser Disc, and again when they released the ""definitive collection"" (widescreen with Dolbly Pro-Logic Surround) on Laser Disc. I bought it again when the DVD became available. I will probably buy it one final time if/when it's released on high-definition video (added in 2012-I have the set on Blu Ray). That's how much I love this movie. ""Empire"", ""Jedi"" and the prequels were all great motion pictures, but only Star Wars (today known as ""Episode IV- A New Hope"") had the magic... because it had never been done before. I understand why my kids don't share my enthusiasm. There is absolutely nothing a film maker can do to get the ""wow factor"" back. At no time did anyone say ""how did they do that"" when aliens were vaporizing humans in ""War of the Worlds"". I don't give special effects a second thought any more. I understand why some people call Star Wars over rated. But I also understand why it ranks #2 in all-time domestic gross and has been near the top of the AFI's list of 100 best movies ever made for the past 20 years. The magic of Star Wars can not and will not ever be repeated. The reason: Prior to 1977, you couldn't even imagine such realistic images ever being filmed. Today, anything you can imagine, you can see (yawn). Star Wars is the greatest triumph in movie-making and deserved to get a Oscar for Best Picture of the millennium. It saved 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy, it began the tradition of the Summer Blockbuster (along with Jaws), it started the special effects revolution and made going to the movies an 'experience'",

And it was disappointing.
This might have been great because of the time which it was released. But for someone watching this now, it's not so good.
The first half drags. But it slowly picks up the pace. They spend so much time creating alien creatures which was pretty unnecessary. It actually has nothing to do with the plot. Lucas probably wanted just to show some aliens.
They looked disgusting and were pointless.
I wish there were scenes of Luke being trained. That was over within a minute and wasn't good.
Whole shooting looked bad. It was so obvious none of them knew how to handle a gun.
The fight between Darth Vader and Kenobi was the worst. It was so lame. If those people are the best with Lightsaber, maybe they should've gone for some other weapon.
The acting was pretty bad too. Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness was alright.
And the final fight was pretty stupid. All they had to do was find someone to watch their back instead of flying in a straight line so that the enemy can hit them with their eyes closed.

Unable to fight the evil Empire on his own, he urges Luke to join him. He tells him of his father's seduction into the dark side. Leia is held captive in the Death Star where Darth Vader uses her to locate the Rebel Base. Dazzling and overwhelming visual wonder from curious droids to strange creatures to massive spaceships. Imaginative screenplay by Lucas who previously tested the genre with THX 1138. Mark Hamill plays Luke as someone seeking his destiny. Carrie Fisher displays authority and vulnerability as Leia. Harrison Ford plays hot shot pilot Han Solo of the Millennium Falcon. He owes a large debt and sees this as great financial gain. Finally there is Alec Guinness as wise Obi Wan who will pass the torch to Luke but not before one last confrontation with Vader. Body builder David Prowse provides the size and intimidation for one of the most memorable villains in cinema history. Destiny is themed within this masterpiece of visual excitement. Score: 10 / 10",

So much even that I bought it on tape 5 years ago or so and when the Special Edition came on to the big screen I went to see it, all new, shiny and beautiful. Now I've got that Special Edition to my avail too and if I'm lucky I'll be seeing it on DVD in a couple of years, just as I hope I'll see The Phantom Menace on DVD in the next couple of years.",

The story is very strong for a SCIF movie. The costumes are very good for the aliens and the robots too. The most likable characters are Luke sykerwalker Han Solo and C3po and R2D2 But I think its the droids are the ones who steal the comedy in this movie As always the story always go for a part 2 so their is always a little more more to the story and secrets being revealed latter on in the series. Overall This is another classic masterpiece that is wroth watching. ,

But no-one who saw this film on first release aged seven could possibly give it a bad review.  It's a simple tale of good-versus-evil, but there's still so much for even the most cynical and cultured of viewers to enjoy: the rousing music, the 70s haircuts, the skillful use of the Tunisian desert (completely convincing as another world) and of course, the stunningly composed opening scene where the great triangular battleship, impossibly large, passes overhead for what seems like an eternity.  Then you have the characters: Darth Vader, the perfect villain; C-3P0, the camp droid; and the bickering duo of Leia and Han. And the touch of extra class added by Brit veterans Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing.  And, most important in an action adventure, there's the perfectly paced, self-contained plot, notably matched in precisely none of its numerous sequels.",

Fun story with many of film history's most beloved characters; not to mention the impressiveness of its success and inspiration. However, the story-arc seems so light-weight knowing what follows in sequels ""Empire"" and ""Jedi"", and the absence of Yoda, Palpatine, Admiral Piette and Lando Calrissian certainly make you realize how dull this film is in comparison to the following two when you re-watch it. The most interesting conflicts of the series happens in the sequels, making ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"" the least intense and impressive of the original trilogy.",

This generation has been entirely molded by popular culture, and as such, Star Wars is of a significance that cannot be overrated.  Because it changed everything in pop, and it created so many icons....Darth Vader...Han Solo...the Jedi Knights...Obi-Wan Kenobi...the Evil, Galactic Empire...Princess Leia...the Death Star...""I'm Luke Skywalker, I'm here to rescue you!""  These elements formed a mythos whose impact cannot be described to anyone older than 21...but there is no one, but no one, born after 1977 who doesn't get tensed up, and feel a shiver in their spine of anticipation for the huge horn crescendo that comes next at the mere mention of the phrase ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...""",

388,19 July 2013,lesleyharris30,8," The Legacy Begins here,","Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope is an outstanding movie with a very well developed storyline, a talented cast and likable characters that will forever withstand the test of time. The Star Wars franchise begins here, and though effects may have improved immensely since this film, it still holds up very well as a beautiful movie that I never grow tired of, people always question what order you should watch the series in, I suggest you start here, it's a light hearted and fun story that kicks off the series perfectly. The cast are all fantastic, each actor delivering an iconic performance, my favourite would have to be Harrison Ford as the witty and sarcastic Han Solo, probably one of the most well written sci-fi characters there is and he suits the role perfectly, James Earl Jones' voice-over work as Darth Vader is also one of the most memorable in film history, the actors always play a large contribution to a films success, and it was all great casting decisions made here. Watching this movie is like watching a piece of film history, every scene is in some way noteworthy, whether it be a well known line, music or just a characters action, no moment goes unnoticed. Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope is a must see for all sci-fans and moviegoers alike. ",

When people flocked to see it in 1977 they did not know how life-changing it would be. I will be as bold to say Star Wars changed the world and an entire generation of children and adults alike. What followed were two sequels, three prequels, toys, books, games, animated series, a religion and millions of dedicated fans. Unfortunately I never got to experience Star Wars in the theaters but seeing it on DVD is enough for me because Star Wars is everything I could want in a movie. My review probably will not add much to the 1,125 already on IMDb but I believe everyone should be able to express their love for movies like this.",
393,24 June 2017,tomgillespie2002,10, Will no doubt continue to astound young audiences for years to come,"When sitting down to pen a review of such a colossal slice of cinema as George Lucas' original Star Wars, it's difficult to know quite where to start. What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been discussed to death by nerds, or studied to no end by film historians? Chances are you'll have already seen the movie and either love it or hate it, or you're one of those strange beings who has reached adulthood without seeing any of the series and have no doubt already formed a dismissive opinion of the space opera. The best approach is to simply talk about the film from a personal point of view, as if any movie has had such a personal effect on an audience, it's Star Wars. I'll state from the off that A New Hope - Episode 4 in Lucas' sweeping epic, but released first - was never my favourite as a child. That honour went to Return of the Jedi, the movie I now consider to be the worst by far of the original trilogy.",
394,15 June 2010,Dr_Coulardeau,10, The whole series is giving meaning to every one of the six films,"To present the six episodes is of course a challenge. I will not present them one after another in any order (historical or chronological). I will make a few general remarks. First, why did the last three episodes come first? It was necessary for the suspense to remain intense about the only important element which is that Dark Vader is the father of both Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa, both on the side of the rebellion against the Empire. These three episodes were more naturalistic and they did not need the special effects, not possible at the time, necessary for the conception and shooting of all the artificial and very strange creatures of the first three episodes. The happy ending would have been ruined by our knowing the genetic filiation between the two young heroes and the arch-enemy of freedom and democracy. Dark Vader had to be black and dark right to the end for the surprise effect of his fathering the two young heroes to be effective. Then the first three episodes arriving afterwards in time did not have the same function they can have today when we watch the six episodes in chronological order. They created a frame of reference. It is the demonstration that the Republic can only fall because it is totally engulfed in corruption, red tape bureaucracy, the incapability to take a fast decision and to act promptly, the constant waste of time because of political maneuvering. On the other side, that of evil, swift and surprise attacks and violence are the rule. The Republic has been infiltrated to the top and the Force itself embodied in the Jedi order has been drowned in bureaucratic impotence. Then the dark side of the Force can easily convince and capture those who are suffering from that impotence and are frustrated by the refusal to act straight away. It is also necessary to think that those first three episodes that came last needed a technology that was not available before and that is the technical justification of the inverted order, though then the director plays on it and with it. Some of the scenes of these three chronologically anterior films are absolutely breathtaking and only because they use the full array of computerized effects. The race in the first film is amazing, the underwater world is fascinating and the clones and their war against the strange giraffe human species is phenomenal and were not possible without the late 1990s and early 2000s technology. And the battles would never have been that impressive without these special effects. Then we can wonder about the meaning of the whole series back in chronological order. A Republic dies in red tape bureaucracy and corrupted calculation and is taken over from the inside by the main leader who is an infiltrated putsch maker and his military coup is based on the full destruction of the only protection the Republic had, the Jedi order though this one had been made impotent by the red-tape dictatorship of the democratic Republic. The Empire that takes over is based on effectiveness, swiftness and the absence of any waste of time due to useless discussions. To the point of any decision taken by one man. Then you can speak of efficiency. But that Empire that is going to impose an absolute one-person dictatorship is not able to control the grass roots movements and the local dynamisms of all the planets and peoples of this galaxy. That's what the rebellion against this Empire needs to be effective in its turn. Underground rebellion and resistance. Yet they cannot succeed if they do not re-conquer the Force because the Empire is founded on the dark side of that Force and is embodied in the father of the main heroes and leaders of the rebellion. The Force has to be re-learned by Luke Skywalker in order to be able to face his father and defeat the emperor who is manipulating Luke's father. This Force is the only real defense and conquering power of any resistance against any dictatorship. Without a Force of that magnitude no resistance can succeed. But then the meaning changed completely from that of the last three episodes that came first and could appear as a simple metaphor of the rebellion against a dictatorship, hence a metaphor of the defeat and disintegration of the Soviet Union for one. Later on when the first three episodes that came last were available, the meaning was no longer the same because history had changed in the mean time. The meaning then is that any democracy when it forgets it has to be fast and courageous in its decisions that should refuse red tape and bureaucracy will automatically fall in the hands of potential potentates or dictators. That is a common myth and political theme in the USA: the Roman Empire died after two centuries. Unluckily the Roman Empire was not the Republic of Rome and here Lucas is playing with our references. Are the USA a target of that decay of democracy? Yes indeed. That's the message today of this set of six beautiful films with great actors, even the perambulating carpet.",

Still compelling when watched now.,"Some frown upon Star Wars, labelling it a fad and being equally unkind to that of its fans. Others praise Star Wars, living by it and its ideas that it garnished to do with 'The Force'. I never had any hostility towards Star Wars but I did toward the genre.

403,17 September 2020,xiaoli7377,9, Movie Magic,"Note: this review was done while watching the 2019 version of the film available on Disney+. The original ""Star Wars"" trilogy are the movies, off the top of my head, with the largest amount of different versions out there, aside from ""Blade Runner."" We have the original theatrical versions (1977/80/83), the ""Special Editions"" (1997), the 2004 DVD releases, the 2011 Blu-ray releases, and now finally the 2019 versions that are available on Disney+, which are supposedly just shelved 2012 4K remasters that George Lucas had intended to use as the basis for 3D theatrical re-releases of his six films before Disney purchased Lucasfilm. Most of the changes that have been made in the forty-plus years of the film's existence are incredibly minor and unnoticeable. In my opinion, the only parts where changes are really unbearable and detracting of the overall quality of the film are the Mos Eisley scenes, where most of the CGI characters and environments were added in the 1997 version. My guess is that Lucas added them simply as a trial run before ""The Phantom Menace"" was released, because that movie contains a lot of similar Tatooine effects to the ""Special Edition."" These additions may have been done with good intention, but they're incredibly dated now and haven't really been updated at all since they were added to the movie over twenty years ago. The reason that I'm even mentioning all of the different versions of ""Star Wars"" in the first place is that I do feel that it is important to mention what version of the movie that I'm basing my review around. The new version available on Disney+ is not the same version of the movie that audiences first experienced in 1977, nor is it the one re-experienced in 1997 or in subsequent home releases. Like I said, most changes are small and unnoticeable, but the bigger ones do detract from the overall pacing and tone of the movie (such as the Greedo and CGI Jabba scenes), and they must be factored into my review of the movie, as should any such Director's Cut or Extended Edition of any film. Thankfully, the weird violet tint of more recent home media releases is gone, so at least the majority of the movie is much prettier and more natural looking again.",
404,9 October 2021,willraye,10, I agree with everyone. It's great,"The original editing is best. Naturally when the re releases came, Hollywood felt the need to add things that were unnecessary. One little creature punching another at Mos Eisley was overdoing it. Also, Hollywood critics revise history by saying they gave it positive reviews upon initial release. They did not. Only 30 years later when it's a classic they are all positive. Why do you think they didn't want to accept Lucas' idea when he first proposed it? He had to make it, himself. Critics miss. We must deal with this fact. Why do organic blockbusters never garner a sweep of the awards given at the end of a broadcast? By that I mean best picture director actor and actress? By organic, I mean word of mouth magical feeling blockbusters with no Hollywood hype? Ones that feel like Star Wars episode 4?",

In this film you can see the influences from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey and the wizard of oz. And I also like how it doesn't set it at an exact place and time so it doesn't get outdated.

Why is a review even being written? Star Wars: A New Hope revolutionized and forever changed the game for American cinema back in 1977, and stands tall today as one of the greatest films of all-time. Back in 1977, there was absolutely nothing quite like it: the blend of epic music, incredible sets, spectacular ahead-of-its-time special effects, superb action sequences, and an overall complete package of film-making that before and since has rarely ever been met. You are immersed in a totally different world in a totally different time period, and thanks to George Lucas and the talented staff behind him that obviously gave their all in this movie, Star Wars is one of the 15 best movies you'll ever see guaranteed.

408,20 April 2005,de_niro_2001,3, The film that invented hype as we know it,"This film with its campaign of spin-off toys, T-shirts, mugs etc created hype as we know it and set the pattern for the hype surrounding Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles and He-Man. No wonder Mel Brooks spoofed it in Spaceballs (""Spaceballs, the flame thrower""!) It's one of the most overrated films ever made. It came top in Channel 4's list of the 100 greatest films but frankly Star Wars coming top in that poll and The Godfather coming No2 is a bit like Joe Dolce's Shaddapayourface beating Ultravox's Vienna to No1 in the UK music charts in 1981. It is not that great a film and the people who let it take over their lives and boast about having seen it tens of thousands of times are very sad. As Carrie Fisher says ""It's a great movie, but get a life"". George Lucas said he was wanting to recreate the spirit of the old Flash Gordon serials and he did to a degree succeed. Looking at it now, it looks as dated as Flash Gordon. The art deco spaceships in Flash Gordon exude the air of the 1930s and there are some hairstyles and clothes in this film that are very reminiscent of the awful fashions of the 1970s.The scene where Luke and Han Solo are shooting at the enemy spaceships has the look of a 1970s arcade game. Like Flash Gordon a lot of the dialogue is very corny (in fact it dismayed Harrison Ford when he read the script). The cheesiest line has to be when Luke Skywalker sees the hologram of Princess Leia and says ""Who is she? She's beautiful."".It is so overpoweringly cheesy it is like having your nose shoved in Stilton. OK, there's no denying Carrie Fisher is a very nice looking woman but ""beautiful"" is a bit extreme. Mind you I think if the film was being made nowadays Luke would say ""Who is she? She's hot"". Sir Alec Guinness didn't like this film either despite receiving a sizeable chunk of the profits. He would discard any fan letters he received that made mention of Star Wars. There must have been lorryloads of discarded letters leaving his house every day when the film first came out1",
409,3 June 1999,Moosey-2,10," Great film, poor acting","Star Wars: A New Hope is a great film.  It started the whole Star Wars universe (that is for all of us who aren't George Lucas) and gave us a look into a primitive futuristic past.  I, being a die hard Star Wars fan, believe that anything that is remotely related to Star Wars deserves a good look over and this definitely beats a lot of other movies to the top.  The only thing that I can fine wrong is the acting.  Most of the actors have gone on and improved very much in their acting abilities like Harrison Ford. But in the beginning he was not very good in fact I would even call his acting stiff.  But we should give him a break because, this was his second movie after ""American Grafitti.""  The only thing that got on my nerves throughout the whole movie was how whiney Luke is.  Lines like ""Uncle Owen, Uncle Owen??"" are screamed at a whiney high pitched voice.

I mean he'd choke people from across the room and punked out everyone he met (except Peter Cushing). I never liked the good guys such as Luke (whinny young punk) Han Solo (loud mouth wind bag) Princess Leia (ugly with danishes on the side of her head) C-3P0 and R-2 D-2 ( ultimate lavender duo).

This is the a silly, hugely over-rated, egotistical, boring, contrived, joyless, cheap and morally bankrupt piece of garbage.  There is simply nothing entertaining about this movie, or any of the trilogy.  The acting is silly and self-indulgent. The story is a very tired hairball hacked up from the throats of who knows how many fairy tales (save the princess, save the universe, etc.).  I wouldn't be so vehement if it weren't for the fact that Star Wars is soooo popular and it's evvveryone's favorite.  *hack*  And people say Titanic is over-rated?  Hello? People aren't going to be jumping up and down over Titanic 20 years from now.  People are still screaming about Star Wars, but this film/trilogy is anything but something that could be considered a classic.

Unlike things like JAWS and Indiana Jones, it ages better than other films and retains its sense of ""coolness"" after all these years. Ok, to be honest, the last two films so far have sucked, let's hope Lucas gets it right with ""Attack of the Fools"". Come what may--no pun intended--I don't think we'll see Episodes 7, 8, and 9.

Yes, Mr. Lucas has done some strange things as far as releases and changing things go. I won't get in to that except to say that they are his films, and he can do with them as he will. That aside, this film is one of those great movies that has just a purely awesome story, is not boring for adults and yet it is MPAA rated such that the young can also enjoy it without being bombarded by violence or vulgar language.

438,4 January 2020,aucoinandrew,7, Entertaining! Innovative! Original? No.,"I'll say what I enjoyed first:
The score- Wow, easily one of the greatest scores of all time. Makes the movie for me honestly. Scenes that would've been terrible without it were redeemed, it's completely original and John Williams killed it.
Alec Guiness and Harrison Ford- The two best characters in the movie acted by the two best actors in the film.
Special effects- It's fairly obvious as the movie goes on that it focuses heavily on its, at the time, crazy good special effects. The work and love that went into this movie are most evident in its countless sets and practical effects.
Now to the bad:
It's not original- It's simple really, Lucas even admits it, the plot follows the basic mono myth of the young farm boy taking on an empire. Nothing we haven't seen before except this time it's covered in gibberish names and space garbage.
The Acting, Dialogue, and Characters- It's so wooden. It's not the worst I've ever seen but the way people talk about this movie is as if it isn't bad. Mark Hammil and Carrie Fishers performance are so over exaggerated. All the side characters such as the imperial officers and Luke's uncle and aunt are just terrible. Their are some great quotes spattered around that are memorable and great but the in-between is just cringey and cliche. The great Alec Guiness would agree with me and he's a part of it. The characters are just card board cuts of classic personalities. Luke is a dislikable protagonist who whines and complains the whole movie and is somehow a master at everything he touches. Han I have no complaints with, he's great. Obi wan is cool and all but nothing we haven't seen before in an old wise mentor. C3po is so freakin annoying and such a useless character, he gets far to much screen time. Leah doesn't do anything except sit back and watch the other characters do all the work. This would be fine if they even tried to have any character development with her but no, she's pretty one dimensional.",

I had not seen many movies before that and this was the first film that actually showed me how powerful cinema can be. It still has the same effect on me now and on future generations too most likely. The beauty Lucas has created for us is beyond belief, the references to Greek mythology and older Sci-fi sagas are intelligent, and the bursts of comic relief here and there are calculated. The story starts with a youth (Mark Hamill) discovering his destiny to fight against the evil galactic empire with his mentor (the always excellent Alec Guiness), a princess (Carrie Fisher), and a hotshot smuggler (Harrison Ford, who provides great comic relief). Excellent, beautiful, and full of eye popping visual effects that still look great now. No film has ever left as great of an impact on me than Star Wars.",

Lucas as a young man sure had an eye for details and it's a pity how he lost this ability by the time he started filming the prequels.

Star Wars is classic T.H. White when it comes to its story and cast of characters. The opening credits was taken from the movie the PLAINSMAN with Gary Cooper I believe. Luke returning home to find his uncle dead and house burned was taken right from THE SEARCHERS when John Wayne returns home to find his place burned to the ground. What else? Little things from Darth Vadar's helmet being the same of a Nazi's soldiers helmet to Obi Won being the perfect Merlin match. Still, don't get me wrong, this film is great.

Who is going to forget the end of the movie, with Luke Skywalker shooting through the canyon on the Deathstar, attempting to the be hero. How wonderful did that look the first time you saw it? Nowadays, that is easy for computers to reproduce, but the scale and scope of the effects by George Lucas and his team is what created the sheer awe and joy of Star Wars. The story is not bad either. A classic Western story with clearly defined good and bad guys, with Eastern Mythology thrown in there to add a mystical element, this first movie is actually the forth chapter of what will eventually be 6 (maybe 9?) movies, set the foundation shrewdly of what has become one of the world's most popular science fiction series. The essential characters, some of the back stories, and wonders of the Galaxy far far away are all introduced, and giving the audience a pretty good time while at it. Originally produced as a stand alone movie, the people at Fox Studios had no confidence that Star Wars would succeed so plans for the following sequels were not on the drawing board, Star Wars is entertaining, but do leave us with enough questions about the Force and Darth Vader and the unseen Emperor that when the following movies do come out, the audience was more than ready to embrace them, and make Star Wars the most successful science fiction series ever.",

In fact I was actually late starter when it came to Star Wars, I watched it for the first time when they re-released the trilogy in 97. It would be fair to say when I watched it I was completely spellbound, for a ten year old this was movie heaven. All the characters are legendary, Han Solo,Luke Skywalker,Princess Leia, Obi Wan Kenobi and who could forget the tyrant otherwise known as Darth Vader. The plot was pretty flimsy but Star Wars is just so much fun you probably wouldn't care. Out of all the main characters Harrison Ford had the most success,going onto Raiders of the lost ark and many more blockbusters. The John Williams score is one of my favourite movie scores along with Superman and Raiders of the lost ark. Star Wars was a monumental success, a success both sequels were going to repeat. In my opinion George Lucas should have left it at three, The Phantom menace was disappointing, Attack of the clones was no better and revenge of the sith was decent.

The special effects were poor even for the nineteen seventies.I mean the small models used for the fighter planes (spaceships?) are obvious. The hulls look as if they were made out of brick not metal. Of course there are no explosions in outer space but why let basic facts interfere with a (bad) story. .

476,30 August 2016,bsilbor,10, Is there anything that hasn't been said about this movie?,"Being born 19 years after this movie was released, I never got a chance to see it in theaters. I was even too young to see the re- releases in 1997. My father first exposed me to these movies when I was about 5 years old, when I couldn't quite grasp just how big these movies were and how much of an impact they had on American, and even world culture. Back in 1977, the world was hurting. It couldn't tell the difference between tyrants and leaders in politics, and villains and heroes both on and off the screen. Star Wars changed that. Whether you think it's overrated or the best movie ever, it would be foolish to say that this movie didn't change anything, be it Hollywood, our perception of leaders, or even our perception of ourselves. This movie, and it's subsequent saga, is, likely, the single most talked about movie in history. If you don't like it, you've at least seen it. If you haven't seen it, you've no doubt at least heard about it. That being said, that means that just about everything has been said about Star Wars. It's great, it's bad, it's overrated, the acting isn't exactly on point, the effects are breathtaking, it's corny, it's nerdy, it's geeky, it's a phenomenon, it's just plain good, everything has been mentioned. So why am I writing this review? Because that means I get to contribute to the story. The story of Star Wars goes far beyond its own universe. We are part of it. The fans, the haters, George Lucas, me, you reading this, now, we're all part of the story of Star Wars. This review may get lost among the thousands and thousands of others, but I still get to contribute to the preservation of this story. The more we talk about it, the longer it'll stay in memory, and the longer it'll exist. When the movies are finished, possibly forever, the story will still live on for future generations to enjoy. Now I get to be part of that story.",
477,12 January 2016,PartialMovieViewer,10, The Best of the Rest,"For me, this movie started it all, and it is the best - hands down. Those special effects were actually very special for their time and groundbreaking. Not only were they stunning for the period, they didn't take away from performers' skills. The directing, writing and scripting were all formulaically fun frolics resulting in a well-paced struggle between space-evil and space-good. I regret, I am no snotty self-loving scientific academic, so my opinion is just that, an opinion (kind of like a dis-provable theory)..nor does it have a price tag, like all them ""collegiate-right conclusions"" if they are what the government wants, you get another grant...wink-wink. OK - a silent dig, and now I am done with that part. Yes, this movie reminds of that 70's romp, ""Flesh Gordon"" ‚Äì minus the flesh. Each character (with the exception of 'The Princess') was riddled with flaws and prone to error¬Öand that is what made them very likable and relatable. Luke is some goofy kid from the space-burbs, aching to drive any old space craft¬Öeven if it is the up-galaxy space-bus; Hans is a bombastic and roguish misfit (ending up being only a hero in his own mind) and Chewbacca is that well-trained pet of Solo, who's excellent training is reflected in a keen adherence to rules, avoiding piddling on space-carpets and not destroying the space newspaper. The galactically-challenged Princess Leia Orgasm, from the planet Spermicide, starts out as some kind of young, punk-brutish femme, whose raging hermones greatly hampers her ability to complement anyone. Of course nothing time and events expedites rapid maturity. By the end of the story, Luke gets a light-stick; Hans envies the size of Luke's light-stick; Chewbacca wants to fetch Luke's light-stick and Leia ends up being an even angrier Leia. That is not all the fun...oh no. I forgot to mention that Garth (""I am your Father"") Vader and Luke end up in a very intense climax, comparing light-sticks to one-another. Now as important a scene as this might be, I wish never to witness this again. Alec Guinness plays a nice old guy (Oldy One Can-o-pea?) and junkie-master whose flaccid light-stick is no match for Vader's. Of course you can't forget General/Admiral Peter Cushing who always plays badder than bad, minus from the poison from the Bad Force. I guess while I am mentioning main characters, I should talk about the two BOTs. R2D2 and C3PO¬ÖI can't say enough. To put it mildly¬Öthe beeps and buzzes were cute for kids¬Öbut for me¬Öirritating. With all this bad ju-ju, this is a movie I can watch over and over. Ulike the other Star War movies, this picture had some charisma, great characters and CGI struggled enough to play second-fiddle to everyone.",

Many can agree with me in saying this is the most recognizable and one of the be movies of the action/adventure genre. The way the story flows and is put together is astounding. While some of the special effects of the original can't stand up to modern era films, it is great that they rereleased the films with updated effects. The movie is also filmed very well. The characters in the movie were set up great too. Their stories all went well with one another, and many of the scenes in this movie are amazing.

But Star Wars is a very good and entertaining film too, and even if many of its themes are more fantasy than SF, the power lies in the images. They're simply magical! From the Star Destroyer entering the screen from the top to the seedy Mos Eisley bar, from the funny robots to the Millennium Falcon, from the Double Sunset to the Deathstar attack, this film is filled with fantastic images which let us gladly overlook any cheesiness ore plot holes or whatever.

And all the imagination captured by these classic stories, all the hysteria it brought out among its fervent fanbase, all started with a movie that made it into fewer than 32 theaters on opening day. So, what do I have to say about the first installment in my favorite film franchise of all time? While ""A New Hope"" is a decent film on its own, and I'm beyond grateful that it became such a massive financial success, from a filmmaking standpoint, it's easily the worst of the original trilogy.

All this nonsense about icons and popular culture doesn't alter the fact that it is junk. To say it is one of the best s-f movies ever made is not saying much. All but a few s-f moves are nothing but escapism, and many of those are better than this. I have no problem with people being passionate about movies they enjoy. I love Old Yeller, but I would hardly call it the greatest movie ever made. The second was better - the battle scenes at the beginning, the ""freezing"" of Han and the battle between Darth and Luke.

490,19 December 2015,barbagvido,9, A timeless classic,"A New Hope is one of those movies that will never be forgotten and will be watched over and over again and never get old. It's beautifully shot, the use of practical effects is breathtaking and everything feels realistic. That's the best thing of the entire movie and not just entire movie, probably the best thing of the entire original trilogy. Characters are relatable, but it just feels like they are not fleshed out enough, but more of that will come in the sequels. While I really like this movie, I don't consider it a masterpiece mostly for the reason I said in the previous sentence. There are just good guys and bad guys. I know they have that charm, but it's just not enough to me. Now more about good sides, the movie isn't boring for one second. The action is very well done, the story is simple and it's perfect to relax. While some scenes are action-heavy, some of them are pure beauty (the double sunset scene is one of my favorites in the series and also one of the most iconic). And what I like the most is what a universe it establishes in just 2 hours and is yet to be expanded in the sequels. Usually big universes like this are made in books or TV shows, at least successfully, but they made such a huge one in just few movies and expanded it with animated series and comics. Back in 1977, before the release, who could expect this would become such an iconic, timeless and immortal franchise. No one took this seriously on shooting except George Lucas and few more people. The story of making this movie, inspires me very much and makes me believe that even when you're hopeless you can succeed in achieving what you want. And, just one more iconic thing that can't go unmentioned is John Williams' brilliant score and after watching a movie you will catch yourself humming one of the tracks from the score. While this movie has flaws, it's still a classic that will never be forgotten.",

But, I do remember my admiration when I watch this movie. You know, I watched it when the year is 2013, and the movie's released date is 1977. During those three decades the movie's visual effects change dramatically. Yet, ""Stars Wars"" is different. With all of the editor skill and their work hard, even in 1977 they can make film that has amazing visual effect as good as early twenty-first-century-movies.

Sure, you can't expect the SFX to be as good as in EPISODE I-III, but how about a plot? What about characters or good actors? The whole story occurs to me as just an introduction to the sequels. Why is there such an enormous cult about this crappy little SF-flick? I am not a trekkie, but I prefer every STAR TREK-film by far to this terrible no-brainer. The 8-best movie of all time?

Like ""Phantom Menace"" and espcially ""Attack of the Clones"", Lucas just doesn't know how to write a ""scene"".  What we get is like a quilt of little bits that are cobbled together.  Each with basically the same pace.  The saving grace of ""Star Wars"" is some of the acting.  Alec Guinness really brightens up the screen whenever he's on.

It took our family close to a year to get tickets so all of our family could see it together, and immediately it entered my subconscious as probably the most exciting two hours I'd had in the cinema up to that point in my 14 years. 20 years later (and multiple viewings), I had an equally thrilling experience by attending a concert of John Williams music at the Hollywood Bowl, conducted by Williams himself, and when the large orchestra struck up the ""Star Wars"" theme, the whole bowl erupted into enormous cheers, even greater than any of his other stunning movie blockbuster themes.",

The theater was black except for the small light coming from the projector onto the big silver screen in front of a 7 year old boy. His eyes glued and wide in anticipation of a film that he knew very little about other than an adventure in space, a place where he always dreamt of escaping to. When the first note trumpeted out of the speakers for the first time, his heart pounded and his soul was free. This universe that George Lucas had captured and the young man, Luke Skywalker, was the embodiment of the dreamy eyed young 7 year old now watching, vicariously living in that universe. From that point on, I grew a little more hopeful for the future, that 7 year old's spirit still laughing, smiling and even crying inside, encouraging me to escape what I thought a terrifying life of abuse from peers and my own subjugating voice telling me I'd never be anything but a loser. This movie's storyline was inspiring to me as an artist, writer, actor and human being. The underlying religious connotations I've never considered religious overload, merely to believe in something bigger than oneself, an energy that encompasses everything, everyone. At this point at the end of 2015, almost 40 years after its release, I am still drawn into that flicker of light and that very first note, a glimpse into what can be, a piece of my own new hope.",

The scenes I like best are the opening scene with the background planet covering the screen all the way long, the scene of Luke thinking and watching the suns of his home planet as the evening falls and as a wonderful music shows his feelings, and the battle just after the 'escape' from the Death Star.

Not many people in my family cared much for Star Wars, but I have to say that it is one of the greatest film series ever made.  A New Hope is probaly my third favorite in the series, in which case The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite and Attack Of The Clones is my second and right after that comes A New Hope.  There isn't much to say about Star Wars except for that is a phenomenon and a timeless classic space opera which will be seen by people of all ages in generations to come.  I think that George Lucas is only making the series better by adding the three prequels to the original trilogy.  A New Hope is a classic movie and is a movie I must have seen about 30 times. Four Stars. I reccomend this movie to anyone of any age.",

517,3 April 2022,coreycitn63,10, Miracle,When Star Wars came out in 1977 everybody predicted it was going to be a flop. Star Wars was supposed to be a 1976 Christmas movie but it had many technical problems which pushed the movie to be released to Summer of 1977. George Lucas was ready for the movie to fail so basically many of the heroes and villains had little backstory but George left little hints just in case. At the time sequels was still risky with only The Godfather and the Planet of the Apes to get sequels. Second 20 Century Fox was in deep financial trouble and only the president of the time Alan Ladd Jr. Had any faith in the movie. As for George Lucas he was not a great director although he did have American Graffiti as his major achievement.,
518,2 October 2010,zardoz-13,10, The Film That Gave Sci-Fi Fantasy Films A Makeover,"Writer & director George Lucas didn't invent science fiction as a film genre, but his landmark film ""Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope"" and its sequels and spin-offs certainly propelled science-fiction from the fringe to A-class productions. What made ""Star Wars"" so charismatic is the hokum that it embraces with such consummate love. Lucas has attributed his inspiration for the ""Star Wars"" franchise to his memories of Saturday matin√©e serial cliffhangers as well as his fascination with mythology. Mind you, nothing in the ""Star Wars"" franchise is remotely original except for its reliance on hoary clich√©s and conventions that fuel the 'space-as-an-adventure' formula with exotic worlds, lethal aliens, and ravishing damsels-in-distress. Basically, Luke Skywalker is another embodiment of ""Flash Gordon"" and Darth Vader is a riff on Ming the Merciless. Harrison Ford's Han Solo may be an outer space smuggler in a fast ship, but he resembles an old frontier western gunslinger for hire to the highest bidder. Alec Guinness is the older gunman/samurai warrior with a strange mind-set that enables him to control weaker minds. Robots and droids emerge as memorable characters, too. Surely, Darth Vader with his long flowing black robes, respirator breathing vocal deliver, and unmistakably Nazi-style helmet qualifies as one of the top twenty all-time evil villains. Lucas contrives weird aliens and animals and populates his film with a number of visually interesting settings. The Death Star as the ultimate weapon is really cool and presents the ultimate challenge to our heroes because they must destroy it. Essentially, the Death Star is comparable to the eponymous ""Guns of Navarone."" There is a lot of sophistication wrapped up in this seemingly superficial saga about a galactic rebellion against tyranny.",

520,18 September 2013,emilmarty,7, Overrated and outdated,"Let me start by saying the movie doesn't suck, given the time it was made. The problem is that its legacy has created die-hard fans which have spawned the biggest franchise of all time; nothing wrong with that of course. But if you take a step back into modern day, you will see a film with all the elements a great fantasy epic should have (unimportant boy gets trained by old man, becomes great warrior etc) but a film where each element lacks the emotion to make you feel what you should. You don't feel sympathy when Luke's aunt and uncle die, you don't care about Kenobi's death because there was never an emotional stand-point that pinpointed him as a ""great man"". Everything simply happens without any given thought about the characters emotions. I could name a million films with all the same elements that have been done ten times better. That said, the originality is genuine, the whole story exciting and it's generally fun to watch. Just a shame its practically been ruined by its reputation as the greatest franchise ever.",

I won't go into any more detail about how bad I think the newest two are so I will leave it at that. This film is very entertaining though Empire is by far my favorite (suprises me this is ranked ahead of Empire).  The only problem with this flick is that it doesn't really get going till they go to the bar where they meet Han.  Also, the light saber isn't used much in this one.  The only duel is between Obi-Wan and Vader and Obi-Wan throws the fight.  Other than that though it is a very solid movie.

A phenomenon, a forever and forever impact on our lives and culture!","What can I say, really so many words and adjectives can be used to describe ""Star Wars"" that it's hard to find them all. Without a doubt this 1977 masterpiece from George Lucas which he done it by his own independent and rebel way clearly is one of the greatest films ever made. So many themes and elements are present mainly a tale of good against evil it comes down to light vs. dark. Plenty of mythology is present as Lucas shows by the different cultures of the film and that one must believe in higher powers to accomplish things. ""Star Wars"" has it's own civil war battle with the big focus on the rebels and the empire's fight over the galaxy with the Empire's greatest weapon being the mighty Death Star which is ruled by an iron fist with the cruel and powerful Darth Vader. Yet even though Jedi Knights are supposedly long gone, enter Luke Skywalker who's the film wild card who just as a simple farm boy wants and has bigger plans to be a Jedi and defeat the evil empire. Help is provided along the way for Skywalker by the beautiful Princess Leia, and droids C-3PO, and R2-D2(who sends the secret messages and signals) and most importantly the trust and experience of loyalty from Obi- Wan Kenobi. As the furry Chewbacca and cocky pilot Han Solo provide the transportation during this galaxy adventure. I must say also that the special effects and model crafted spaceships used in the film are superb many had never saw anything like it. Great job from George Lucas his direction of the scenes and sets is fabulous. Really what more can I say this movie is so special to me since it was one of the first I saw and being a little kid in the 70's it has a special place in my heart. Seeing this for the first time it was like my real cowboy movie, making me role play in my head and among friends the character of Luke Skywalker thinking he was real I wanted to be him! This epic saga also was the film that started to make me collect action figures, and truly believe in myself and see that the world was about good versus evil. ""Star Wars"" created a lasting impact on our times and culture a great tale of morality, faith, good versus evil, and it had all the genres of fantasy, adventure, escape, sci-fiction, and drama mixed together. Really one of my favorite movies of all-time, and always remember what it taught us all ""May the force be with you"".",

The story is interesting, but that's it, the sets are cheap, costumes are almost laughable. But yes, it can be enjoyed ever so slightly, the drama is quite convincing, as it's the acting which is to be applauded.

Star Wars was so simply made, and carefully crafted, and gingerly put together by a man who had such deep passion for the story and everything he built from the ground up. The ""special effects"" they used, the story, the characters, everything about it is the definition of timeless because it is as good now as it was more than three decades ago. The characters come to life, each and every one of them and the story leaves you riveted to every moment and throws this mysterious force of good against one of, if not thee, greatest villain in movie history.

558,5 May 2016,ironhorse_iv,9, Star Wars is the Modern Day Blockbuster! An Awesome Tour-de-Force!,"What can I say about this Sci-Fantasy film directed by George Lucas, that hasn't been said before? Everybody knows how magical, exciting, epic, and fun, this space adventure is. After all, it was directly influence by other older mythological stories like the Arthurian tales, classical Greco-Roman mythology, & old Sci-fi film serials like the 1936's 'Flash Gordon'. The movie even got influence from historical events like the foundation of religion beliefs, American westerns, Samurai Culture, and even World War 2 and Vietnam. Plus, I think, everybody know that the film follow the hero journey path laid out by mythologist Joseph Campbell's book, 'The Hero with a Thousand Faces'. So, what are some things, you might not heard of? Well, here's one. Did you know that Lucas had originally wanted to remake the 1930's Flash Gordon movie serials, but the rights were snapped up, so he choose to make his original Sci-fantasy movie, instead. The original story of the film was way different than the film that came out with lizard people, helmetless villains and older main characters. One big different is how long, it was. It had to be split up. The discarded first half was later used as prequels, although some have disputed this claims, saying that Lucas never mapped out the story at the time. Regardless of that, the half of the story Lucas was left with, was still too long, so it was split and rewritten into three parts with 1980 'Episode V: Empire Strike Back' and 1983's 'Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'. The first of this trilogy would be the film that Lucas would make, originally called 'Star Wars', now retitled in 1981 as 'Episode IV: A New Hope'. Anyways, both versions of the script had a plot where a royal is trying to deliver a device, through a ship in a last ditch attempt to rescue a planet, from being destroy by an evil empire. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the generic plot is a bit secondary. It's really not anything new, when you think, about it. After all, films serials like 1939 'Buck Rogers', had stories like that, every week/weekend. It's not perfect at all. There is ton of plot-holes in the film that doesn't make sense, mostly with the Death Star to be note, here. However, I'll let those things go, because it's supposed to be, a fun-corny unrealistic fantasy movie even if the movie has contrived coincidence moments. Yet, I can't let the mediocre acting in this film go pass. I really didn't like the farm boy turn Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)'s whinny little voice. I really wanted him to shut up, most of the film. Also, it's bit weird, how Princess Leia's (Carrie Fischer) weird British accent, comes in and out. Despite, the limited acting chops of the two main leads, they got better as the film series went on and their characters were very memorable. In my opinion, the supporting cast was probably better than the main cast. Harrison Ford as the scoundrel smuggler, Han Solo was a lot of fun. Much of the great humor of the film, comes from him. Alec Guinness as Luke's mentor, Obi Wan Kenobi was amazing! I love how Shakespearean, he was. He made me, believe in the force. Last, but not least, Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin was brilliant. His enthralling voice & his charming, yet evil manner was evil and menacing. The same goes with James Earl Jones voicing the character of Darth Vader. Still, I would love to see a version where 'Star Wars' try-out actors, Kurt Russell, Jodie Foster, Christopher Walken & Toshiro Mifune played these characters. Anyways, most people remember this film for its visuals special effect and action. Those were amazing, even if a bit dated. Another noticeable thing about Star Wars is the soundtrack by composter John Williams. His thematically rich score would give a heart to the action and usher in a new era of romantic old-style music in films. Even the sound effects like Wilheim scream were top of the line. Another thing, worth noting is the exotic locations. All of them, work, even if the production for this film was troublesome, due to weather issues. Another great thing about this film is the well-paced editing. For the most part, the original 1977 version, had really no slow parts. Yet, the 1997's Special Edition kinda ruins that, by adding fake-looking pointless scenes like Luke talking to his crewmates before the battle or Jabba the Hutt visiting Han Solo. While, a lot of the Special Edition edits, do help the film, by retouching outdated visual effects; it also kinda hurts the film. A good example is the 'Han Solo shot first' scene, which kinda betrayal his pirate-like character! While, this might sound controversy, I think the Special Editions were indeed somewhat needed. Updating old source materials is nothing wrong, as long as you keep the original films out-there, as well. After all, the special editions kept 'Star Wars' fresh on everybody mind in the mid-1990s & got me, into loving this film franchise. It's work for what it is; which is a Director Cut version. Some people might hate it; some people might love it. Nevertheless, it expose new audiences to the mythos of these films. Star Wars is one of those films that has become sewn into the very fabric of our popular culture. With the continued prominence of the Star Wars story through movie sequels, animated series, video games, and toys, I glad this movie went on, to great success in awards and money. The impact of the first film in the series was enormous - tremendous profits helped to generate funding for Lucas' state-of-the-art special effects factory known as Industrial Light and Magic, Lucas' sound company, THX & Lucas' American film and television production company, Lucasfilm. Overall: It was indeed a cinematic masterpiece. Every major movie blockbuster released today, has George Lucas to thank for. So go see it.",

Here is a simple plot line for those alien people who haven't seen it yet. The Empire covering a whole galaxy is tracking down the last of a peace keeping force known as the Jedi Knights. The leader of the ""hunting party"" trying to catch the princess, a rebel, is Darth Vader, a second in command type of person who works for the Emperor. He is a cyborg, but that is made up for by him being very strong and talented with the use of a light saber. He and the Emperor along with the Empire have created a large space station known as the Death Star. Luke Skywalker, a young man from a desert planet, destroys the Star when he becomes a hero working for the rebels. I rate the film 4/10. The special effects are great.

To start off with the flaws of the film, I feel at times the story can be rather bloated. There is just so many ideas and so much going on here that its hard for the film to balance it all. It's characters however, are quite the opposite. Although they are very unique in presence and style (even how they are portrayed), I feel many of the main characters are rather thinly written to make way for the plot. Some moments are certainly very campy, and some can be very fun, but there are a handful where its just too ridiculous to take seriously. Besides all that, I still found the film to be enjoyable. Its slow paced nature and expansive worldbuilding makes for a sci-fi experience very few films have the chance to offer. Its sets are incredibly elaborate, as well as its makeup, special effects, and costumes- and the look of the film itself is incredibly unique and dazzling to look at. The film's score is excellent, and the actors do put their all in their respective roles. The flms standouts are largely, although not limited to: Anthony Guinness, Anthony Perkins, and of course Harrison Ford. In the end, Star Wars is a bonafide classic for a reason. There are few films that are able to be so boldly creatie from the get go, and even fewer that find its audience immediately.

598,3 December 2020,dworldeater,8, Game changer for American movies,"I have somewhere in the neighborhood of over 600 plus user reviews on IMDB, it seems silly that I have not commented on the original Star Wars trilogy yet. Better late than never, I suppose. But I will let those who read this be the judge. In my youth I was totally enamored with Star Wars. I went to see all the movies, I had the toys and even dressed up as Darth Vader for Halloween. I wasn't alone though, Star Wars was a huge phenomenon . It had mass appeal and became a huge part of American pop culture that would change the way movies were made by in large from that point on. George Lucas may have had a lot of influences, samurai films, westerns, Flash Gordon and Ray Harryhausen fantasy movies. But there was never anything like Star Wars before (or since, except other Star Wars movies). The 70's was an awesome time for movies, arguably the best time for American cinema with a lot of really gritty and uncompromising movies that were really well made and accepted, such as The Godfather and The French Connection. However, this was a time where movies were a lot slower and this intergalactic space adventure floored viewers with something totally different. While the film has some flaws and some pretty bad acting from Mark Hamill in particular at this time. George Lucas has to be given some serious credit for his creative vision and excellent storytelling. Visually, the film was way ahead of its time with groundbreaking special f/x and moves along quick with lots of pew pew lazer gun action. While I didn't like Luke Skywalker at all in this movie as he was kind of a weenie (and I couldn't stand Princess Leia either, but did she look good), Harrison Ford was at his best here with the introduction of cool antihero Han Solo. Alec Guinness however was fantastic as Obi Wan and along with Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader gave the film some class and excellent 1st class actiing. I can't say that I am as enthusiastic about Star Wars as I was when I was a youth, but I still enjoy it. My personal favorite is the next installment The Empire Strikes Back and whatever new Star Wars movie gets made, the original trilogy still holds up. This is the beginning and it does stimulate my inner 5 year old. Although, I am now closer to 50, it still makes for a good watch.",

I'll always look at this film in a visionary sense, simply on the level that it simply reshaped film as we know it, which is sometimes more important than the content matter. This seems to be George Lucas' vice: he always makes an average first movie. Episode I was relatively inferior, and Star Wars was fairly pedestrian in many ways.

Starting out with the original movie, I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed. I definitely enjoyed it, but I'm just hoping this isn't the best installment in the series. A New Hope focuses on the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia, and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star. A farmhand named Luke Skywalker acquires droids that have the architectural plans for the Death Star. The Empire searches for the missing droids, and Luke agrees to help Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to get the plans to the Rebel Alliance and save the galaxy from the Empire's tyrannical rule. The only reason I was slightly disappointed by the movie was because the first 45 minutes or so were just plain boring. The initially slow-moving plot and cornball dialog didn't really impress me much. What kept me watching was the amazing set pieces and cinematography; it really made up for the flaws the beginning of the movie had. The last half of the movie, however, is incredibly entertaining, fun and action-packed. The climax especially was breathtaking and impossible to forget.

The rebels, so willing to die for a cause, seemed awful selfish in not wanting to sacrifice themselves to save the others.  How many ships did Vader blow up while in the narrow tunnels?  He'd pick off groups of three at a time, and each one would sit there and say, ""Oh no, he's locking on.  I'm being killed!"" None of them seemed to be willing to slam on the breaks and smash themselves into Darth's ship, killing the villain and saving the day in one move.  Give me a break.",

618,31 August 1999,Chuck-149,1, Good but over-rated.,"Frankly, I think ""Star wars"" is a great movie.  It was in a way the first of its kind and was very impressive.  However, I also believe that many people are turning this movie into one of the best of all-time for nothing. I don't remember having been hit by anything surprising except for the fact that everything was in space and that people lived in battle ships.  If you ask me, I think ""The return of the Jedi"" was the best of the trilogy (I don't include the one that came out recently since I haven't seen it). However, I won't deny the fact that there is an incredible lot of imagination contained in this classic and that one of the reasons I probably enjoyed ""The return of the Jedi"" the most is because of some of the questions that remain unanswered and are answered in the sequel or the third.  Some of the best scenes of the trilogy are in my opinion held in the first and if George Lucas hadn't invented the story that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father, ""The Empire strikes back"" and ""The return of the Jedi"" probably would not have been as good as the are.  So all in all, ""Star wars"" is still the best of the trilogy and is a real must-see.",

Now when you look back (to this period) and with all of the latest dire sequels (and prequels), it's kind of hard to form a sound critique. The strength lies obviously with the ground breaking special effects but the cast and character were also super strong. The whole franchise has been blamed for the dumbing down of the Science-fiction genre (which it did for sure) but George Lucus was certainly a director, with a huge imagination and it's rather clever in parts. seeing it in the cinema, upon its release was just a jaw dropping experience!",
621,27 October 2019,harryplinkett14,5," Silly, but fun","This is by far the worst film in the trilogy, in part due to a low budget and the difficult task of finding the right tone and figuring out how this fictional universe ought to work. Back then, Luke and Leia were not yet brother and sister, and I guess it was unclear whether Han or Luke should become the ultimate hero. It seems Lucas wanted Luke to be the hero, but in the following two films he is really just a part of the subplot about the 'force' and his issues with Vader. But real drama and action revolve around Han, Leia, and the rest of the gang. Han is the real hero, Luke remains an awkward, and disturbingly sterile character reminiscent of a munk and hopelessly lacking in testosterone to even try to be the hero.
Anyway, while a lot in this film is really fun to watch, the plot is not very engaging, some scenes come across as clumsy, and the ending is not nearly as exciting as the opening of the film.",

Star Wars, on the other hand, took a different approach by opening in 32 theaters instead of 700 like Jaws. Once word of mouth spread, it expanded to more theaters and eventually displaced Jaws as the most successful movie of the decade. As for how it stands the test of time, it does.

For its time. As someone looking back and watching this in 2015, it's certainly a good movie, but it has its laughable moments. The first scene, all the lasers conveniently miss their targets, there are some comedic death scenes (that were not intended to be so) and the aliens are obviously puppets - no ifs ands or buts about it. But despite these goofs in the film making (which you have to remember, this came out in 1977 - but I'm judging it from a 2015 standpoint), it's genuinely a good movie. The plot sets the precedent for the epic saga that will come afterwards. Original, iconic characters like Chewbaca, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Jabba the Hutt are unforgettable. The ""childlike"" charm of Luke Skywalker and the interplay between the haughty and arrogant Han Solo, as well as as the bantering between droids C3PO and R2D2 give the film enough comedic relief to make a film about galactic civil war more ""down to earth.""

It was a simple idea of good over evil, rescuing the helpless, discovering adventure, mammoth technology and sword and sorcery. Luke was the boy we could all identify with. Ben Kenobi was the wise leader. Han Solo was the cool, quick-witted pirate. Chewie was the faithful sidekick. The droids were great comic relief. The princess was smart and strong. And those light sabers were so cool. The movie is timeless, transcending generations. More than 30 years later, it still works magic, wonder and awe with new generations all the time.

I am 18 and it's really ashame because i listen to my friends etc talking about star wars and considering it a piece of crap, it's really ashame because those as many other people judge because of the new trilogy, however the original sw trilogy deserves everyones respect because we are talking about an epic, people say that the story is nothing new and they have seen a similar one many times, however think just think of how original this movie was back in 1977, it was a turning point in history. I believe that all true movie lovers should watch the original trilogy before daring to judge this cinematic colossus that has lived its mark in the history of movies.

Set design, costume design and the like are superb; as of course are the effects, but it all rings a little hollow to me; maybe The Empire Strikes Back will prove a more satisfying film. The actors try their best, but the script isn't really centred around the creation of layered characters, although each of the main characters is defined well two-dimensionally. The only actor of truly great calibre in the film is Alec Guinness, wonderful in so many British films in the 1940s and 1950s, particularly ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" in which he plays 8 parts and ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". Guinness is good, but simply not given the scope to show his talents to the full. Harrison Ford as Han Solo is reasonable, as is Carrie Fisher in an underwritten role as Princess Leia. Peter Cushing is forgettable, overshadowed by Prowse/Earl Jones as Vader. The music is quite impressive. The film could have done with some better comedic touches; and with Alec Guinness this shouldn't have been difficult; that's a problem: Obi-Wan needed to be a more varied, ambiguous figure, in my view. While it should be mentioned this is a pretty wonderful film for children, it only rates as pretty good escapism otherwise. Rating:- *** 1/2/*****",

It helped establish the concept of the blockbuster film and opened the doors to multi-million dollar movie budgets. Along with Jaws (1975) and the Omen (1976), Star Wars (1977), also reinforced the idea of the profitable, summer movie season. The summer movie season is a staple of Hollywood movie distribution today. It also helped begin another Hollywood staple, by stating to the world, a movie doesn't have to stand on its own. It would be part of the establishment of the film franchise idea. A concept, which quickly began taking hold in the 1980s. Much like any movie, it had to get past the test of the box office, but as we all know, it had no problem. Star Wars (1977), would become the highest, grossing box office movie ever.

And the movie's timeless appeal lies in its easily identifying universe - whether it's R2-D2 delivering signature beeps, Darth Vader oozing through his mask and Harrison Ford dressed up as a space-pirate it's so iconic that cinema would never be the same again after this enormous hit in '77.

681,20 November 2017,Josh_The_Critic,9, The Start of the Biggest Franchise,"Star Wars is big and grand not just to scale but to it's three-dimensional characters, interesting story, and it's impact to culture on a whole. Everyone knows about Star Wars and it's memorable cast of characters, like the young Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill), the tough Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher), the scoundrel Han Solo(Harrison Ford), the wise old man Obi-Wan Kenobi(Alec Guinness), the hairy wookie Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew), the two droids C-3PO(Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2(Kenny Baker), and lastly, the best of them all, Darth Vader(David Prowse). With such a large cast, they are they hit or miss? They, obviously, are a hit and every one of them gives such a performance people will remember them decades later. This movie was so great, that it's seventh cannon film, The Force Awakens(2015), had quite a few elements from the original which translated well now as it did then. Though, there are some inconsistencies I've notice particularly with the acting. One example is with Princess Leia where one moment she'd have a British accent, then it changes to another accent. Also sometimes Luke can have laughably awkward acting moments, that can almost be considered on the level on what George Lucas did later on with Anakin in the prequels. And, from time to time their are some lines that you might not remember, or stick to you; they can be presented not that great. But for a majority of it, there are several quotable and memorable lines in this film, though even more is found in it's superior sequel: The Empire Strikes Back(1980).

689,2 August 2017,wmullerswm,2," This might just be the end of my film critics career, but I gotta say, this movie sucks","How I used to admire the Star Wars saga back in the times that I have never really watched it! I totally agreed with the critics that it has opened a new era to the sci-fi films and is one of the best films ever made. Well, now that I have finished the film, I can say fairly that, Star Wars: A New Hope has visuals and ideas that surpass its age, but they do not compensate for the extremely weak storytelling and character design and basically everything else. And don't you tell me that it is a movie that ought to be viewed, not thought, and merely enjoyed; try to do the same and sit through the Transformers franchise and Suicide Squad. Three things stood out in this film: the special effects, the sound design, and the first act. Mainly three things stink about the movie: the plot, the character, and the theme. I do not really understand how they made those ships and razors, but they look authentic to me. The best shot of the movie in my opinion is a POV of the ship flying down the ditch at the military base in the end, though they've used it twice if I remember correctly. That shot is also extremely well done, and the special effects team behind this deserve a lot of acclaim. The sound design is also great. Together, these two aspects help create a world (universe) that feels real, which adds bonus points. And that's why I liked the first act best: it exploited the novel world(s), and the experience is simply immersive. Now let's talk about the bad things. Firstly, the plot is bad. This film was made in 1977, and films with a plot of saving the princess and then bombing all the bad guys are quite getting old don't you think? There are also so many times of the characters just standing in the rain of razor gun fire and not get a single hurt, yet all the bad guys seem to be extremely vulnerable and easy to get hit. Even the princess hits much better than a trained soldier. And then the characters are as simple as those in the Forbidden Planet. But even that film gets to have a great robot, and now in Star Wars we get to have two robots: one is a human in tin, and the other is a dog in plastic garbage can. Most characters do not develop, and the ones who do do it in the most clich√© and uncreative way possible. Seriously, I just do not understand how this could ever go into the same class with films like Godfather or Citizen Kane. It is just plainly bad!",
690,19 November 2016,TheCinephileENTP,6, What.....?,"So..this is Star Wars? One of the so called ''greatest films ever made''? Well, this is underwhelming. Star Wars is not a bad movie, but I do not believe this is at the level or Citizen Kane or The Seventh Seal. It's just so average. You know, I can see why this has a fanbase, but this fanbase has hyped it to hell. The acting was adequate,the metaphors and subtext were so obvious it hurts, and the effects were meh. I cannot understand why people praise the visuals in this film as being landmark and revolutionary. 2001: A Space Odyssey, released 9 years before, has effects that look much better and hold up today. Star Wars looks 1977. Kubrick's masterpiece looks like it could be released any day. It's absolutely beautiful and timeless. Star Wars is just so annoyingly overrated. I don't hate it, I enjoyed it somewhat. But, I think I'll watch some Ingmar Bergman or Orson Welles to enjoy myself before considering giving Star Wars a rewatch.",

After seeing The Phantom Menace though I realized what a real masterpiece of film making the original Star Wars has become in my eyes. The feelings I have for these characters is one of complete love and affection. You can't watch Star Wars and not care about the main characters in the film.

A brave and almost unknown writer and director, with a vision and drive to see it through.
The Sci Fi flick as old as time itself, good guys rescue a princess from the bad guys, with a help of a wizard.
But with great characters, played by many relatively unknown actors who fleshed out their roles to become the world wide icons they are today. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, stand out as the main players, ably supported by Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew as the masked heroes.
They are matched, in almost supportive roles by legends Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing.
To the ultimate bad guy, Dave Prowse as Darth Vader, a man I had the pleasure of meeting, just after Empire had been released, as 8-9 year old SW fan, I was a little star struck.
With a great script and defining musical score, it still stands the test of time. It also has pioneering special effects that at the time, were just mesmerising.
I was 5 years old when it first came out, now 48 and for me its still as huge as it was then. I can vividly remember being turned away from the cinema first time round as it was a sell out.
THE only time in my life this has ever happened.
I have to say for many Star Wars has become almost a religion in itself. It is bigger now than what it ever was.
I have a copy of the original, unaltered film, which in some respects I can see why George Lucas wanted to make some changes, however there are some things that should have been left alone. Han always shot first.
For the few that haven't seen this, switch everything off, get comfy and swept away by this saga.

716,3 February 2001,jhaggardjr,10, My all-time favorite movie,"""Star Wars"" is the best movie that I've ever seen. It's been my favorite ever since I saw it when I was a kid. And it still is today. This is the ultimate sci-fi classic that takes place ""a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away."" I love everything about ""Star Wars"". It has some of the most memorable characters for a motion picture. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Darth Vader (David Prowse, with the voice of James Earl Jones), and my personal favorites: C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2D2 (Kenny Baker) are characters in the grand tradition of great movies. I'll never forget these characters for as long as I live. The story is excellent, which focuses primarily on a young man (Luke Skywalker) who becomes an interplanetary hero with the help of a wise old man (Obi-Wan Kenobi), a beautiful princess (Princess Leia), a cocky spaceship pilot (Han Solo) along with his wookie sidekick (Chewbacca), and a pair of robot friends (C-3PO and R2D2) as they do outer space battle against a powerful force (and a powerful villain in Darth Vader). The action scenes and special effects are outstanding. This movie features some of the most astonishing special effects that I've ever seen. ""Star Wars"" broke new grounds in special effects technology when it was made back in the mid-1970s, and the effects got an advancement 20 years later when new footage turned up in the 1997 re-release of the film. The new special effects featured in the 20th anniversary ""special edition"" could not be done in the 1970s because the effects technology wasn't as advanced back then as it is now.",

Being a protocol droid, or butler, and butlers being stereotypically British, it was probably inevitable that C-3PO should be camper than a rowe of tents. There's no getting around this. Threepio is quite, quite gay. And considering their odd relationship, R2 - the Swiss Army knife of droids - is fiercely loyal. R2 could mosey along fine without old Goldenrod, who usually depends on others, including his gutsier companion, to get him out of scrapes.",

The movie appealed to all ages and genders. You have to have been there to understand the effect when you saw it for the first time. Masses of people stood in line to see it over and over again with stars in the eyes. I was one of them. ""Starwars"" took what we always hoped was possible in a sci fib movie and made it a reality. It is no accident that it gave rise to five sequels (or prequels). Lucas deserves all the Kudos and dollars he got for this magnificent creation. It set a standard by which all future science fiction movies would be judged. All that for me makes it a 10.",

As a WW fan, it's also a guilty pleasure to see how much of Ben Kenobi/Jedi/The Force seems directly ripped off from W.M.Marston's Emotions of Normal People, like the Motor Self (Ben Kenobi) passively reinforcing itself through active compliance (accepting Vader's strike) and the ventriloque talk that put fear on the sand people.

Weeks after the films' opening, I remember standing in line for hours among the events' full demographic spectrum. Looking at the film 37 years later, I can see where my suspension of disbelief and fickle patience with directorial re-releases has taken over. It's as if the geek inside Lucas' mind needed reeling in. The aliens are silly and the dialog about ""womp rats"" remains ridiculous. But for all that is and has been said, my entertainment continues through our main characters, on their personal quests which seemingly will again re-unite for another episode hauled in by the Disney Machine and their power.

One of my favorite things about this movie is the music!! John Williams has done a wonderful job on this movie as well as the other ones, in fact he won an Oscar for it. I don't know how George Lucas came out with something so perfect, but I'm glad he did. The acting was great, I think Harrison Ford is one of the greatest actors of all time. In this particular film of the Star Wars trilogy I think that my favorite character is Han Solo, the cool tough guy whose best friend is a walking carpet. Alec Guiness plays wonderfully his part as Obi-Wan Kenobi, the old Jedi master who trains Luke on Tatooine.

The weaving of action, adventure, drama, conflict, and a plethora of other genres and literary devices is absolutely remarkable. All of this encased in a theme of science fiction is a clear cut example that great writing is just that, great writing.

Many would say that Empire Strikes Back is their favorite, but this is mine. It came out of nowhere and made a lot of money. It also did without all this pre-release hype. No one knew what to expect, but it was really something. You can have your Empire or Jedi, or even Sith, but this for me is the best. It introduced us to a fictitious yet believable space opera set in a distant galaxy far from Earth and gave us a handful of memorable characters. What more could you ask for? It also combines elements from Flash Gordon, spaghetti westerns, mythology and samurai films. That combination makes for such a wonderful movie. I admit that this movie isn't for everyone, especially those who don't care for science-fiction or alien movies, but if you haven't seen it, you don't know what you're missing! It's fun!",

Star Wars changed film forever, never before had a film become such an icon on not only the big screen but in our ways of life and society as a whole. Still to this day Star Wars merchandise dominates the shelves of stores and rules the world of pop culture. George Lucas introduces us to firstly to two droids, the mild-mannered C-3PO and his quirky companion R2-D2, before really introducing us to characters of Luke Skywalker (our hero), Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han Solo, Chewbacca and possibly the most recognised and terrifying villain in cinematic history, Darth Vader. The beautiful sets and locations really sell the idea of otherworldly planets, while having a familiar feel our own home planet. Characters are well developed with many visiting places they never thought possible and having fully developed arc's from start to end. John Williams gives us at times heart-wrenching, powerful orchestrated scores to accompany the stunningly beautiful shots and mesmerising film making. With a movie as iconic and important as Star Wars it is hard to find flaws, whoever the small flaws with the film has are mainly with the special effects which today certain shots and effects don't hold up as well today, also to mention the slow-paced duel of two 'masters' in the latter half of the film doesn't sell the idea of a fight to the death and sometimes cheesy and clich√©d character dialogue and situations.

767,1 January 2009,jamesbond007167,1, An ordinary farmboy must learn the ways of a Jedi knight to save the rebellion which stands against an empire.,"Star Wars is no ""masterpiece of synthesis"" or ""triumph of American ingenuity;"" it is a fraudulent copy of several good works of literature. Lucas steals the ideas of Frank Herbert in his work entitled Dune and plagiarizes even more off of unknown novel I cannot recall as it is so obscure, he felt no need to give it credit. I have heard arguments which claim that The Lord of the Rings is just as childish, but those arguments ignore the fact that The Lord of the Rings is a blatant and outright statement, a parallel to the horrors of the First World War. Additionally, the acting is phenomenal, the characters have depth, and the story has meaning. The authors of such arguments clearly view the battle scenes as similar to Star Wars, only having appeal because of the special effects. But things such as the gigantic war elephants actually represent something, whereas nothing is representative of anything in Star Wars. These elephants represent tanks, the new and deadly weapon that were finally used more frequently in war. I can overlook the discrepancies, such as the fact that the first time the Death Star was used it took but a few seconds to fire, but when the are attacking Yavin, they must maneuver around the planet to reach the moon, as there are such discrepancies in most movies. However I cannot ignore the lack of depth each of the characters has: Luke is like Dakota Fanning in War of the Worlds--he is paid to whine, and whine, and scream, and whine. ""But Uncle Owen, I was going to go the Anchorhead Arcade, I don't want to work on the droids."" His character is painfully dull, and the actor, Mark Hamill, lacks any sort of talent. None of the characters are relatable, none of them have any complexity. They are all straightforward representations of archetypes, with no combinations of emotions--in fact, they seem like the have no emotions whatsoever. Everything is superficial--I enjoy Star Trek: The Motion Picture ten thousand times more than Star Wars, and The Motion Picture is one of the most painful movies I have ever watched. Watching Star Wars, I can picture each actor--if they may be so honored by such a title--with a script in front of their eyes. It seems they are only reading; a common acting saying goes, ""Show, don't tell,"" but I have never been told a more boring story. Besides the painful, shallow acting, the plot is poorly written. There are no twist or turns, no interesting facets or components which one does not expect to appear; everything is predictable, everything is as plain as can be. Star Wars is ""a masterpiece of synthesis:"" I don't think I have ever seen a movie so perfectly blend plagiarism, horrid acting, a lack of depth and emotion and complexities, and so many other despicable aspects. As for its ""ingenuity:"" well, if plagiarism and poor writing, acting, and characters constitute ingenuity, then this movie deserves a 10 out of 10--if not, Star Wars most definitely deserves nothing but scorn. Why so many have found this movie so enthralling I will never understand.",

For 22 years though, we're with Luke Skywalker (Hamill), a youngster keen on joining the Rebel alliance, teams up with Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Guinness), a couple of droids (R2-D2 and C3PO) and rough outlaws (Harrison Ford's Han Solo and Peter Mayhew's Chewbacca) to save princess Leia (Fisher) from the clutches of the evil Empire and destroy their battle station, the Death Star. A New Hope is groundbreaking, both in genre and visual effects. It represents the forces of good vs. evil perfectly. Luke's the guy we all want to be, whilst the Sith Lord Darth Vader intimidates with voice, presence and action. Leia and Han show glints of romance that hints at more to come. ANH is an all round great film in a world that encompasses unlimited possibilities. It's more of a need to see than a want.",

Alec Guinness himself asked Lucas to get killed at the end in order to get rid of the awful dialogs and the bad acting. I am sorry I cannot just keep on lying about this movie: this is for your kids but in now way should it be put among masterpieces. IMDb is a web site about movies, not about cult and self-proclaimed nerds or geeks.

773,7 January 2005,Krippler,10, The second best Star Wars.,"Let me just start off by saying that I will always love the first Star Wars film. However, to watch it as an adult is a much different experience than watching it when I was 10. It's still a very entertaining film, however there are a few reasons why this first installment of the trilogy doesn't hold up for me. First, Lucas's direction bothers me just as it has in the new films. Some of the scene transitions are just sloppy. If this had been a first film, all would be forgiven, but he had already done THX1138 and American Graffiti, the latter being one of my favorites of the 70s. Second is something I never noticed until the last couple of viewings. The actors in the film seem either bored or are just not sure about the lines they were speaking. With the exception of the voices (James Earl Jones and Anthony Daniels) all of the acting is very flat. I know this is nitpicking because the special effects are incredible, it's just that I can't, out of all 5 films so far, think of one truly exceptional performance besides Harrison Ford in Empire. This review is not meant to pan this film which I view as a classic. I just wanted to share some criticisms.",

775,12 January 2003,shanfloyd,9, For a Separate Place in the History of Cinema,"Star Wars.... so simple a name, yet so appropriate, so meaningful, so attractive. This ultimate venture in imagination can not be, and should not be compared with any of other popular sci-fi movies. I don't believe there were any other movies before this where events took place totally outside earth or without its inhabitants. In that sense Lucas created an entirely new world of his own. Got a fine story, containing detailed descriptions of lifestyle, politics (these two things ordinary sci-fi ones lack) and of course, action. Creation of characters are excellent, as they never seemed impossible. As a director and writer, Lucas excels in many ways, such as in cinematography, plot-twist etc. But probably the best thing about this movie is its special effects. so perfect, they hardly seem possible in 1977! To tell the truth, this movie is probably the best in the whole saga, followed closely by ""Attack of the Clones"".",

However, six years later, my tastes in movies have changed and Star Wars seems disappointing. The acting is mostly lacklustre, even from Alec Guinness, who looks bored of the whole exercise. It seems a shame that Sir Alec would be doomed to be remembered as Obi-Wan Kenobi for the rest of his career, as it's hardly a good part. Elsewhere, the effects are getting worse as the years pass, although the Death Star trench run still excites after countless viewings. And anyway, at least it's better than the prequels.",

Secondly, the cast is awesome, all actors did their work perfectly (my favourite is Harrison Ford as Han Solo. Thirdli, the main part if film is visual effects.

779,25 November 2011,Maleplatypus,3, Fat rebel pilot's name is Porkins,"More than 30 years and probably 10 watchings (this time blu-ray) I can say - boy, what a crap! Even three stars are too much now. I know, being much younger and all in those times this movie was like ""end of the world"". I didn't notice incredible stupidity lines (yes, Sir Alec was right; see trivia), horrible (if any at all) acting and lame sfx (some of them were quite good, though - x wings for instance). Also, if you watch this movie now after first three parts, it's even worse. ""Old friends"" Obi Van and Anakin behave almost like they've never met before. Luke and Lea are twins like a kangaroo and a shark, and whatsoever have no resemblance with their parents Padme and Ani. In this ""fourth"" part technology is deteriorated beyond belief (nothing to do with sfx!), as the Star Wars universe went couple of hundreds of years backwards compared to the Revenge of the Sith (episode III). The casting is also lame but was probably good for that time (""hey, guys, who wants to star in a movie and probably get paid?""). I never thought much of Mr. Lucas as a director and this movie proudly proves it. Someone (not George Lucas!) should remake the second part of the trilogy, and patch all the holes (of which many are wider than the Solar system). Try to save what could be saved and make these movies proper and balanced sequels. Kids will always buy stuff like this. It will always be a cult and a favorite fairy tale. And a soap-opera for grownups, of course. And yes: over- weighted rebel pilot's name is Porkins :) Oh, I forgot the spoilers mentioned above! Here they are: spoilers.",

Harrison Ford was the only one who did. The weird names and bizarre creatures are hard to digest after a while. Star Wars plots are inconsequential. Only nerds, dorks and geeks know them. It is the characters we remember: Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Obi-Wan, C3PO, R2D2 and Chewbacca. My favorite may be Obi-Wan.

798,25 January 2021,Jackblyth8,8, A Truly Incredible Illustration,"Strangely, 'A New Hope' was the first of the Star Wars saga to be released, despite being Episode 4. Cleverly following the Star Wars story: Rogue One, the film's title continues from Princess Leia's ending words from the last film, stating that 'the schematics will bring hope to the Rebellion'. The film is centred around the execution of the Rebellions plan to counteract the devastating Death Star and prevent it from causing further damage. The Galaxy is in a period of civil war to begin with. With the plans stolen from the Galactic Empire, they are situated with secret Rebellion leader Princess Leia, however, her starship is intercepted by an Imperial Star Destroyer under the command of the brutal Sith Lord Darth Vader. Leia, throughout the film, is presented as a tough character to break, her courage and integrity shines through her personality and there is no doubt she wears her heart on her sleeve. Played by Carrie Fisher, her Princess status is somewhat overlooked by her incredible guidance and leadership skills, at the heart of the Rebellion's fight against the Empire. Leia knows she is set to be captured and held hostage by the agent to the Empire, Vader and carefully places the schematics in the memory of the astromech droid R2-D2, who, along with protocol droid C-3PO, flees in an escape pod to the desert planet Tatooine. The droids are captured by tenacious Jawa traders, menacing small creatures with oversized cloaks to hide their image, only darkness and and two eyes can be seen. The traders sell the droids to moisture farmers, Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew Luke Skywalker. While cleaning the rather sandy R2, Luke accidentally triggers part of a holographic message from Leia, in which she requests help from Obi Wan Kenobi. The only Kenobi Luke knows of is 'Old Ben' an elderly hermit. He asks his uncle if he knows anything, but Owen steers the subject of the conversation in a different direction. The next morning, Luke finds R2-D2 missing, and while searching for him, encounters Old Ben. Ben reveals his true name to Luke as Obi Wan and tells young Skywalker of his days as a Jedi Knight, former peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who derived their power from an energy field called the Force, until they were wiped out by the Galactic Empire. Obi Wan appears of course much older, but his wisdom from the Force has not changed, he is the only character we see from an apprentice and Jedi trainee, to becoming a Jedi Knight and joining the Council, and still present post Republic. Luke is intrigued by Obi Wan's knowledge and is told by Ben that his father fought alongside Obi Wan as a Jedi Knight until Vader, a former pupil of Obi Wan's, turned to the dark side of the Force and murdered him. There is no evident explanation to why Obi Wan didn't tell the truth to Luke, but can only be inferred that the wise Jedi didn't want to overwhelm Luke, and steer him away from becoming a Jedi himself. Obi Wan presents Luke with his father' old weapon, a lightsaber. R2 interferes and plays Leia's message to Obi Wan, in which she begs him to take the Death Star plans to her home planet Alderaan and give them to her father for analysis. Obi Wan invites Luke to accompany him to her homeworld and learn the ways of the Force, but Luke declines, saying his aunt and uncle need him. With little knowledge of the history of the Jedi and the Republic, Luke is obviously going to be conservative and curious about Obi Wan's stories. Leia of course was born into the Rebellion via her guardian, Senator Organa. Returning home, Luke finds that Imperial stormtroopers have killed his aunt and uncle and destroyed their farm in search of the droids, leaving Luke no choice but to accept Obi Wan's invitation. The transition is nothing more than a sudden change of events, fortunate that Luke wasn't on the farm for the same to happen to him. They travel to a cantina in Mos Eisley, where they hire smuggler Han Solo to transport them. No different to his characterisation in the Star Wars story: 'Solo', Han is still as witty and smug as ever. The famous pilot, owner of the Millennium Falcon, is confronted by Greedo, a green faced Bounty Hunter working for a local mobster Jabba the Hutt, to who, Han owes money; the confrontation ends with Han shooting and killing Greedo, but the real question is who shot first? Obi-Wan, Luke, R2-D2 and C-3PO exit Tatooine, with Han and his sensitive Wookie co-pilot Chewbacca on their prestigious ship. The Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin orders the destruction of Alderaan, Leia's home planet, using the Death Star's super-laser as a show of force. The crew on the Falcon are iconic, known as the original characters of the saga; Luke - played by Mark Hammill - appears intelligent and comfortable in his position on the mission, intrigued to learn the ways of the Force, just like his father did. Obi Wan - performed by Alec Guinness, but only just as Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune was considered also for the role - provided the certain stability and gravitas as a character. Harrison a Ford mastered Han Solo - the confident, smooth pilot who's bravery ventures him into more than just driving a ship. The crew discover the planet's remains and is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam, which Obi Wan goes to disable. Luke, unaware of his separated sister, discovers that Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star and is scheduled to be executed, rescuing her with the help of Han and Chewy in a swashbuckling series of escapes. His task accomplished, Obi Wan sees that others need a distraction to board the Falcon, and in a terrific scene, he comes up against his former brother, a man he considered as a brother, who he chose not to kill himself on the Volcano in Mustafar, he sacrifices himself in a lightsaber duel with Darth Vader, knowing his choice will ultimately help the Rebellion, he is killed. The group depart the hangar but are caught up by four Imperial TIE fighter which they fight off. Using a tracking beacon placed on the Falcon, the Imperials follow the Rebels to the hidden base on Yavin 4. Leia's priceless schematics show that the Death Star might be destroyed by firing torpedoes into a two-metre-wide thermal exhaust port that directly leads into its reactor, triggering a chain reaction. Han collects a reward for his role in Leia's rescue, intending to leave and repay Jabba. Luke joins the Rebel squadron in desperate attack against the approaching Death Star. In the intense late stages of the watch, the Rebels suffer heavy losses in several unsuccessful runs during battle. Vader leads a squadron of TIE fighters and prepares to attack Luke's X-Wing, but Han returns in a thrilling event, attacking the Imperial fighters, sending Vader spiralling into space. Guided by Obi Wan's spirit, Luke turns off his targeting computer and uses the force to guide the torpedoes into the exhaust port. The Death Star explodes just before it can fire on the Rebel base, killing Tarkin and Imperial troops on board. It is worth noting that Vader wasn't on board, after his failure to take down Luke's X-Wing whilst in his TIE fighter. In a trump jams ceremony at the base, Leia awards Luke and Han medals for their heroism. An excellent opener, and first taste of life in a Galaxy far far away... blessed with action, intense events and the introduction of prominent individuals. The schematics proving to be the key to the Rebellion's success. Episode 4 is truly a revival of the Rebellion, and signs of better times.",

In that era, when such a magnificent space opera was brought to the screen, you can experience how shocking and shaking the film industry was brought by the advent of Star Wars. Apart from the phenomenon- level cultural boom created by the entire series, there are still many regrets in the first work alone. For example, the background is one-sided,Can't wait to see the new trailer!!! the lightsaber gesture is stiff, and the description of the original force is far from enough. But the diversity and magnificence it sketched for that distant galaxy is enough to inspire people to yearn for the starry sky. At the level of the film industry, it had also had a profound inspection in the creative direction of future generations, transcending the meaning of a film itself

But the movie doesn't hold up now. If you look at the two sequels, they are much more entertaining. Somehow I find them soooo much better. At least they have some story and some character development. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is s√∫ch a superior movie to this one. I think the reason why this movie is being rated so high is because people remember how they experienced it as kids or teenagers. I'm sure they had quite a lot of fun when they first saw it, because the SFX were so good, and the story was simple and uncomplicated. But this movie is no longer entertaining today. I was bored silly when I first saw it a few years ago. Then I rented the sequels and found out they were much better. This movies had much more interesting stories and better dialogue. Maybe George Lucas is to blame. He certainly broke new ground when he made this movie, I got to give him that, but the superior sequels were directed and written by others (not many people know this). A while ago, George returned to directing with the prequel, EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE, which in my eyes was a complete disaster.

The special effects really look dated, and the attempts at humor are cliched. Anyway, about the special effects, i guess they looked wonderful in 1977. But one thing is for sure: the effects were better in episodes V & VI.

Alec Guinness was awesome as Obi Wan Kenobi. Harrison Ford was incredible in an early role for him, as the space pirate who doesn't really seem to care about anybody but himself! Mark Hamill was fantastic as the kid from the moisture farm with dreams of far away.

George Lucas was influenced by Serials like Buck Rodgers and Flash Gordon, as well as taking classic tales like a boy wanting to go on adventures meeting some interesting characters that eventually meet a wizard, that meet a couple of other interesting characters all to save a princess from the villains is all fairytale stuff, and George Lucas knows that. He even puts mythology and religion into the film, later in the Prequels he puts political stuff to show how things that were so good they collapsed and how someone gained the power they did. From the opening crawl, to the destruction of the Death Star, from seeing Luke meet C-3PO and R2-D2, to Luke getting his fathers Lightsaber and learning about the Force by Obi-Wan, to them meeting Han Solo and Chewbacca and all of them going to the Death Star and saving Princess Leia and Darth Vader killing Obi-Wan, to Luke destroying the Death Star and killing Grand Moff Tarkin, seeing the victory of the Rebels, this is a Masterpiece that deserves it's place in Film History.",

What I liked the most about this film was lots of colorful characters. Actually Star Wars is like a mix of all sorts of movies like westerns, war or samurai movies (I know it's funny but Jabba kinda reminded me of Vito Corleone from Gotfather). The special effects were so realistic that even most of the nowadays Sci-Fi movies haven't overcome it. The action was good, though those sword fights were a little to slow and even looked funny sometimes, but the shoot-out scenes and chase scenes were very impressive.",
814,15 April 2010,cwbellor,5, Jek Porkins,"Many would have you believe that Star Wars is about a little blonde pipsqueak who wants to fulfil his dream of becoming a space samurai. Not true! The true heart of this epic saga is the character of Jek Porkins, the portly, ill-fated, X-wing pilot of Red Squadron. For those who have seen Star Wars but have no idea who I'm talking about, Porkins is Red Six. He is a young, ambitious member of the Rebel Alliance whose dreams of kicking ass and taking names were cut tragically short when his T-65 X-wing starfighter was struck by debris, leaving him with several mechanical and computer malfunctions during the assault on the Empire's planet-sized Death Ball. During his moment of technical weakness, Porkins was sucker blasted by enemy turbolaser fire and killed. There have been many jokes at the expense of Jek Porkins' honorable memory. For example, some have said that Jek's X-wing simply couldn't take the weight of his masculine frame, that it simply wasn't realistic. Well, how realistic is it for a Tusken Raider to leave a wimpy farmboy without a crushed skull when he has ...a skull crusher? How realistic is it for a princess to walk out of a giant garbage disposal with her white dress completely unstained? And don't even get me started about target shafts that are only two meters wide.",
815,19 August 2008,kyle-cruse,10, One of the best movies ever made,"Always in my top five, ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"" is what sci-fi, action, and movies in general are all about. Even after two great sequels and three good prequels, this is still the best ""Star Wars"" film. I love the simple plot of this film that gets an entire saga going. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) needs help in her rebellion against the galactic empire and sends her droids R2-D2 and C-3P0 (probably the two best non-human characters in film history) to get Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to help her. Along the way, they become property of and friends of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Eventually they all meet up and begin their battle against the empire. I don't know if it's the greatness of the characters, the plot, or the visuals of this film that make it such a classic, but it is. I can't explain why, but it still tops all of the other ""Star Wars"" films for me. It's truly a perfect movie. The best film of 1977 (in my opinion) and one of the best films of all time. I doubt anyone reading this hasn't seen the film, but if you haven't, you're missing out on something wonderful.",

821,23 December 2016,cdjh-81125,9, A New Hope For Cinema,"Star Wars A New Hope is a film that is really hard to review, how am I going to say anything new? How am I going to give my own spin on this film? Well I don't know but I'm going to give it a try. Considering that this film came out the The 1970s I really cannot praise the Ambition of George Lucas enough, he created an entire world in this movie, a world that has been explored ever since the release of this film and the exposition feels natural and done to make the universe seem lived in. The special effects of this film still hold up to this day Most likely due to Lucas' decision to use practical models over full blown images created entirely through digital means. While this film is undeniably incredibly entertaining one of the greatest praises I can give this film is its complete reliance on its characters. This film has its characters all in interesting places and the screenplay all gives them compelling arcs and interaction and makes this film even more worth watching. While the main characters were done extremely well so too were the villains particularly this film (and the trilogy's) main antagonist, Darth Vader. While in this film exclusively we don't learn so much about him as a person he just has this presence to him every time he is on screen, he's a very imposing villain and this film clearly set the standard for how to build a compelling antagonist. Another thing I loved about this movie was the fact that it didn't feel the need to give all the answers, it left certain things open ended in order to make the sequels more compelling and it was not done in a shameless way to simply profit out of it but for a story telling device that paid off in masterful form. The spaces sequences in this film are jaw dropping, like I said he special effects are seamless but the pure tension and believably of it all makes the final battle of this film much more entertaining and gives us an impression of real stakes. My one and only gripe with this film is certain points where the film slows down needlessly and sometimes just to provide exposition that was purely not required. ",
822,10 March 2001,bleakeye,8, The Force,"George Lucas' Star Wars is a wonderfully produced film about a boy that wants to find his place in the universe and is placed in life-changing situations. George Lucas' imagination comes to life in Star Wars.  A simple yet meaningful story is combined with the futuristic vision of George Lucas along with special effects way ahead of it's time.  Along with Episode V and VI, the Luke Skywalker trilogy of Star Wars is a satisfying movie experience. For me personally, I think this is a beautiful movie that gives us many essentials in quality film making.  A story with necessary elements (a ""coming-of-age"" film), breathtaking scenery, a capable cast and an inspired director.  A great film overall. Of course, a movie can not be without it's flaws (No matter how much we want it to be perfect, it isn't).  I myself didn't feel much of an impact while watching this movie.  The story wasn't relevant to what I believed in and the special effects and robots' dialogue do take away from the overall impact of the film.  The dialogue was a little weird but I guess that was expected due to the futuristic nature of the film's setting.  Overall, the film's slight flaws that I've pointed out can not take away from the greatness of the film and to some people, may give opposite reactions that I've had. To the people that seem to hate everything they see in this movie, I say keep an open mind and enjoy.",

This movie showed people a whole new potential that movies could actually have, by leading sci-fi into a direction never before seen. Movies after 1977 have never been the same, the vision of George Lucas was the start of it all This is with the result that pretty much every scene is iconic at this point. Movies are a subjective thing, and if star wars isn't your thing, then fair enough, but give this a watch before saying no to star wars. You can easily watch this without being a hardcore star wars fan, and still enjoy this movie alot! This movie is my favorite of all the sw movies (even though Empire in many ways is objectively better), and it pretty much defines my childhood. This movie is beautifull.

One is ""I'm 40 years old"" and it reminds me of my youth, the days before all the super crazy CGI and all the rip offs of this film and can remember a time when there was really nothing great out then as far as Sci-Fi was concerned (just look at Logan's Run today). The other is ""I'm 20 years old"" and have no conception of the history of film making and have to give SW a one star rating because the effects are old or I'm just jealous that my generation does not have a film event like this and probably never will. Younger people need to realize that in 1977 there were no computers, video stores, big screen TV's, DVD's or bluray. Heck there was barely video games (were talking Pong) or VCR's and cable TV was in it's infancy. This is why kids went to see it multiple times because in 1977 movies were the big thing and we had few other ways of feeding our need for cool stuff like SW. That and the fact that the film created a new very believable world that was a great escape from the bad taste of Watergate and Vietnam, both of which were still very much in the news.",

830,9 October 2021,ballouvince,10, The Hollywood critics got it wrong,"They want you to believe they loved it upon initial release but they did not. Official critics want you to go by their recommendations so they can't reveal the reality that they hardly ever agree with the masses. If so, they would have given Bridgerton emmys for the actors and the best series. More often than not, if a show or movie is immensely popular, right out the gate, in organic fashion, without Hollywood hype, it never wins the best picture award or best actor and actress award or both, along with best director. And certainly never a sweep of those awards. Star Wars got no hype. It was low budget for its time. I remember a collage of seemingly incomplete scenes and no reveal of the big bang moments. George knew how to keep its essence, a secret. Word of mouth on the street, alone, blew this episode 4 movie up. But if you look at the latest reviews, people born 30 or more years later would think the Hollywood critics got it right. But it's revisionist critic history. I was there in 1977 and I purposely read the reviews after I first saw the movie. The Sound of Music MAY be the only movie where critics and audiences agreed. Unfortunately, I was too young to be sure. That movie felt organic, too.

Also, naturally, the establishment did not revise what black people thought of the movie, if, indeed, blacks were in high profile critics circles at the time. According to wiki, which is controlled, blacks did not like that Vader was voiced by a black man and dressed in black. The establishment only revises the critic history of the non black critics that were in the premium positions. It is known, who they are. Audiences of all races seemed to enjoy the movie.

Simply put, Star Wars is a masterpiece, made with meticulous attention to detail by a reclusive but highly knowledgeable film maker known for experimenting.  Star Wars speaks to the child in all of us, that naive spirit of adventure, of Good versus Evil, that pure idealism that surrounds us with feelings of awe and wonder.  It's a great work of imagination, of tribute to the classics of the past, of legends, heroes, magic and wide open fantasy.

A New Hope is one of the handful of movies to attain cinematic immortality. George Lucas' timeless myth exists on a plane that few movies can ever reach, as a kind of magical accident. You can't intellectualize why Star Wars works like it does, although many, many, many people have tried. It's George Lucas' disparate tastes and goals that shape A New Hope into something utterly unique in Hollywood.

The only person in the film with onscreen charisma is Harrison Ford (which explains the directions of careers after the SW films).  The fascination that ""Warmongers"" have had with this series of movies (this one, in particular)is beyond my meager understanding: It's obvious to anyone who isn't a sick freak obsessed with these movies that Lucas & co. made it all up as they went along (no epic master plotline as many mongers wish to believe--Lucas was on a journey with no destination), which left them with each successive production to try and write their way out of the box they'd previously written themselves into (luke i am your father-but you killed my father-only in a manner of speaking--what nonsense is that?).Sorry, gang.

The success of the movie and franchise is now legendary as this launched the whole genre into one in which there was finally serious money being thrown at it after years of being subject to B movies with laughable affects. The special affect at the time were awe inspiring as they set a new bar for quality (even though they remade many with CA in future releases). For the era it was the thing for which it won awards, and specials were made on how they achieved such great special affects. By today's standards the original may be laughable, but the role the movie played in causing the genre to go main stream is what makes it stand apart as a part of movie history. Soon we had Alien and a series of high budget, good script science fiction to watch (along with those taking advantage of the new popularity). I remember thinking after The Empire Strikes back that this brought hope to my dream that someday they would make a series of movies that did justice to The Lord of The Rings. It took decades, but it came to pass.

It's true that some of the dialogue is stupid, the effects a little shaky and even the acting (Hammil's especially) is wooden in places. But film is craft and to imagine one mans vision crafted it is amazing. It could have been terrible, it could have been a stinker but he put a team together that to me, pulled off miracles. The story is not original, it's a composite of every fantasy adventure written but it makes for a dazzling spectacle. John Williams, the man who made Jaws the tension filled thriller it is, scores a dramatic, fan fare opening. It's as if he knows how important this film is. I have to love it.

However, nearly 40 years have now passed since this movie first made a cinematic revolution around the world, and now, better cinematic elements than Star Wars are coming to the big screen and that's just the reason why I don't like Star Wars. It's not even the film of my time in the first place and I was born just around the time when cinema started making further advancements in filmmaking, so it is obvious and logical why I don't like Star Wars. I found the film completely boring and uninteresting, however I do understand the reason why people loved this film BACK THEN. The only things I liked about this movie is the fact that the movie takes place in a galaxy far, far away, which is obviously an original setting for a sf movie, the technically imaginative Death Star, the well chosen cast, Harrison Ford's intriguing character, the Darth Vader costume and mask, the arrival of the light sabers, the plot and the movie's mythology. My rating for the movie: 6.0/10",

I have literally seen this film hundreds of times, and still get goosebumps when Luke switches off his targeting computer. I watched it again in honour of the 30th anniversary (the original theatrical cut on DVD, with, importantly, Greedo not getting a shot off!) and it was, as ever, great entertainment. Best film ever? No (for myriad reasons). Favourite film ever? Unquestionably!",

This is just a basic kid's story about good vs. evil, with a princess, etc. some good moments - the death star, the desert, but too few to warrant such hype. also, why do all star wars fans slate the new ones, which are infinitely better?

It was so profound an experience for my adolescent mind in 1977 that I wanted it to be real. I wanted to live in this majestic universe of black and white choices and absolute power.

It is packed with fantastic characters that are impossible to forget. The story is perfectly developed and the dialogue is always good(unlike most actions/science-fiction movies).

This film changed cinema as we know it today. It changed many things: Visual Effects, Film and Sound Editing, Action and just Fiction. What it didn't revolutionise was acting or directing. Aside from Alec Guinness' great performance and good ones from Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones, the acting in this picture is a touch stilted. Mark Hamill is winy as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford is always complaining and Carrie Fisher seems to go in and out of a bad British accent.

Nobody knows if there are highly developed life forms out there in the Universe, let alone other civilizations. Outer space deals with distances that are hard to imagine, let alone conquer. ""Star Wars"" is set in outer space, but our Earth is nowhere to be seen. That's because this movie takes place in a whole different galaxy, a fictional one, of course. Despite dealing with technology beyond imagination, though, the story is not from a future yet to come. It is from the past. ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" is how the movie itself describes it. The technological wonders seen in the film might seem to contradict the ""a long time ago"" idea, of course. But they don't, because, for example, and let this be an easy example, our Sun used to be brighter and hotter, and our planet was uninhabitable back then. But Mars could have been in a whole different situation because it is further from our Sun. That means the red planet was once in a better set of circumstances, a milder one. Now think of those countless other galaxies, their own solar systems and, in turn, sets of planets. Nobody knows what is out there, or was out there.",

Sorry I wasn't born fast enough to enjoy all the special effects that were only good by 80's standards. OK we will get the bad out of the way with first because I do have some compliments to throw this movies way. As said the special effects are garbage, for example in the trash compactor scene the eye of the alien briefly pops up and it clearly looks like a badly made puppet. If we all complain about CGI because it is unconvincing then why can I not complain about unconvincing practical effects? The action is also garbage. Seriously in the very first few scenes of the movie there are Storm Troopers coming a very small doorway, the rebels should have massacred them, but instead the opposite happens. Do I even need to mention how rubbish the light saber fight between Obi- Wan and Vader was? Do not give me any rubbish about production delay's, production of a film is irrelevant to critiquing a film. I have to really stretch my suspension of disbelief to believe the sequence of event's. Do the imperials at the beginning just forget droids exist? Can they not scan for droids? Why can they not just board up the pipe on the outside of the Death Star? Why did the Laser Luke fired bend with the pipe?. Loads of plot conveniences. By the way they never inform of the Empire's ideology, philosophy or motivation. Seriously the bad side of the force is literally called the dark side? that is really on the nose. Alright now for the good. The acting was good, the writing for the dialogue was good, the characters were great, the cinematography was great, it had a good concept (shoddy execution though) and it never really bored me. No I do not see being an industry influence for other Science fiction films as a positive. The influences of a film are irrelevant to critiquing a film.

The battle scenes are exciting and get the viewer involved. The tension during the attack of the Death Star is so intense that you can almost cut it with a knife. To anyone who has, for whatever reason, never seen this movie, I suggest you pick up the trilogy and watch all three of them back to back. 10/10 for sure.",

977,12 November 2001,maxnrisa,8," A Sci-Fi classic, one of the best ever made.","Good Points: Truly a classic and, for its time, ground-breaking movie, Star Wars is one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.  Even today the original movie, which is now actually Episode IV of course, holds up pretty well, even in the special FX department.  When you realize that Star Wars has been around for twenty-five years and Lucas can STILL pack a theater, all one can do is kow-tow to one of the gods of Sci-Fi. Bad Points: About the original movie, there is little to complain about. What few complaints one could conjure are due simply to the fact that the movie is so old.  But all things considered including age, the only complaint I have is that its very typical in a lot of ways.  With the exception of Princess Leia, all the main characters are men.  Surely a technologically advanced society would also have moved forward in a social way as well, meaning more women in positions of authority.  This is prevalent throughout the Star Wars series.  Also, Lucas's directing was a bit banal.  It was okay, but nothing spectacular.  Someone like Stanley Kubrick would have made the movie absolutely immortal.",

I don't mind the strange orange force-field under the land-speeder! I was born before (well, way before...) the Special Editions were released, and I'm proud of that. Let me just say some bad things about the so called ""Special"" Edition: 1- All the CGI is totally out of place and looks horrible! 2- The new ""Jabba the Hutt"" Scene spoils the revelation of the Millennium Falcon, plus, we learn NOTHING MORE than we did with Greedo. 3- Greedo shoots first. And misses! What's up with that?!? On the other hand, the Original Edition ROCKS! These are the films all of us grew up with! I'm proud to say that I won the Original, Unopened 1995 Edition last night on ebay! Yay ebay! And only for 15 stinking' dollars! Back onto the subject of the movie, even though the effects may look even more fake than the Special Edition, they fit like a glove, and don't stand out! As for the acting, the best here is Harrison Ford as Han Solo. Everybody else is great, but he sticks out as an old favorite. If there's one good thing I can say about the sets, it's this: THEY LOOK LIKE PEOPLE WALKED AND LIVED THERE! They're dirty and scuffed, unlike any of the other sci-fi movie sets (not counting Episode 5 and 6). Of course, how could I forget the music? John Williams scores music that fits perfectly into every scene! The only track that should be in the movie is ""The Imperial March""! Overall, watch the DVD (the DVD'S OK), but don't watch the horrible ""Special"" Edition. Watch the movie that, in 1977, took us to a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...",

And the weird thing is that I was a little disappointed that first time. Star Wars had been SO hyped that by the time I saw it back in 1977 I was expecting a non stop shoot 'em up from start to finish. The fact that the movie came out of the gate so quickly when Darth Vader and his storm troopers attacked and boarded Princess Leia's starship only increased those expectations. So naturally the following scenes in the desert on Tattooine right after that intense opening were a bit of a letdown. The desert sequence seemed to go on FOREVER, even though it really doesn't last that long. It wasn't until the 2nd time I saw Star Wars that it really hit me just how great this movie was. I think the trick was that I wasn't watching it with expectations or a critical eye the 2nd time..I just sat back and enjoyed it. A friend at the time criticized it for not being good science fiction, but he had it all wrong. Star Wars isn't a science fiction movie per se, though there are some terrific sci fi elements in it.

What's really great about this film is how it didn't have to be non-stop action, in most cases it's the stunning character and world designs that make it stand out. 
Now most people view it as Episode IV but that does it no justice.
Star Wars did more then creating cool characters and a good story. It built a world of unending imagination.
I hope generations from now our grandchildren can still appreciate what this film did.
Now my reason for not giving this film a full 10 stars is because of the enhanced version that currently seems to be the only version available.

The special effects are fairly good for the late 70s/early 80s, but the storyline isn't exactly something it would take a genious to come up with. I can think of many other scifi movies that would rank equal or over Star Wars. As for the prequels, Episode I was a dud in my opinion, Episode II was a smidge better. It's all really about getting to watch how the Anakin/Darth Vader thing plays out, but the three year waiting periods just ruins the whole thing.

1028,31 March 2005,eldergod-1,8," Very good movie, but not the best in the series","The legend begins with this old, but great movie - Star Wars. It is obviously made with love and it is a very nice introduction to the magnificent world of George Lucas, full with humor, terrific action, very likable characters and creepy villains, including the notorious Darth Vader, probably the coolest character in the series. The movie begins like a typical faerie tale, on a small planet, and the main character Luke Skywalker is just an ordinary boy, caught in extraordinary events. Ben Kenobi, the wise old man with mysterious past is really an interesting and charismatic hero, Han Solo and his friend Chewbakka are hilarious and even princess Leia is nice - not with striking beauty, but likable and human. And the villain... Vader. When I was young I dreamed to be like him. He is a symbol of the true evil - big, black, menacing, ruined and with this skull-like mask. His voice, his powers and his attitude made him possibly the greatest movie villain, even if in this film we saw a glimpse of even greater evil in the face of the hideous old Emperor. The story is good for a beginning, but a bit slow. However, it becomes better in the next two movies.",

The story is perfectly paced, and all the characters are likeable. The performances have all gone on to be classics. The story is so good in fact that its basic structure has been copied twice within the same franchise! Unfortunately due to low budget and the time of the release, parts of the film do not hold up at all.

The paving in this movie is the best in any movie, especially considering the magnitude of information it has to get across. Never are you too bored nor are you too confused by the sheer amount you have to get across in the measly 2 hours (I'm looking at you lord of the rings).
The chemistry between Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo) and Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia Organa) goes without saying, but the subtlety of their mannerisms towards each other portray so well how they feel about each other at each moment during the movie.
The world building is amazing, making this Galaxy far, far way a long, long time ago feel so real despite having aliens and tyrannical rulers.
Speaking of, Darth Vader is probably the best movie villain of all time and I don't think it's even close. Even from the first scene in the entire movie, it's clear the menacing and fearful nature of this frightening character. He is the complete antithesis of our protagonist at the start, being wise, emotionless and merciless compared to the naivety and emotionally governed Luke Skywalker.
Obviously John Williams' score is amazing, setting the mood perfectly for every scene.
Everything from this movie is iconic, be it old Ben Kenobi and Darth Vader's fight to the lines uttered to the final act where the stakes are so real it keeps you on the edge of your seat, even in your 50th viewing.",

This is the film that raised the standards for Sci-Fi space films. Before this film, Sci-Fi space films were very hoaky, and let's face it, ridicuously stupid! Space films before 1977 also made space look clean and more sterilized than a dental office. But in Star Wars, they actually showed space trash!They didn't try to make the future look clean and beautiful, they potrayed it as being a dirty, scary place, which it probably will be. The plot was very interesting for it's time, and still is today. I really like this film, and I would reccomend it to other people (80% of the people in the country have already seen it though).

Although Jaws was the first blockbuster, this film started a series of films that have generated billions of dollars in movie sales and merchandising.

The story of Luke Skywalker, son of the fallen Jedi Anakin, which has to rescue Princess Leia Organa (chief of the rebels) from the evil Empire of Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader is famous around the world. The special effects are fantastic (thanks to John Dykstra, John Stears and all the others...) and the cast is wonderful. The good idea has been the one to choose the cast. the three principal roles are assigned to three unknown actors (in 1977 Harrison Ford wasn't still Harrison Ford) and to place two great stars of English cinema as supporting actors: Peter Cushing is exceptional as the evil Tarkin (he played the movie with slippers at his feet, because the boots were little) and Alec Guinness gives to Obi Wan Kenobi a mythic air.

I say that because the original unaltered version gets the story through best without the cgi Jabba walking with Harrison Ford which is just plain embarrassing to see. The action is great mainly dealing with ships and lasers, but there is one awesome and epic light-saber fight which is kinda short but worth every minute to witness the first ever battle.

Luke Skywalker is now one of the most iconic heroes of all time, and I love his character development a lot. We didn't get to see that much lightsaber action, but the movie was still really good. That says a lot about it. Darth Vader is the most iconic villain of all time, rightfully so. He is very threatening and insanely calm at the same time. His story is also very beautiful. This movie is also surprisingly funny. It's no comedy masterpiece, but some of the jokes really land. Overall, this movie was so fun and insanely rewatchable.",

The name clearly shows what is seen in the movie, but it's amazing how the saga, or rather the ""universe"" Star Wars, does not pass the feeling that something is bad, something evil people, the image of Darth Vader with the music who makes perfect sync with him, is not enough to scare anyone. The death of Darth Maul may have been the scene of more thriller saga, and even had blood. I say this tongue in cheek, but of course shocking scenes of thriller genre are not part of Star War, and should not do. The complexity of the lifestyle of a Jedi is a portrait of a disciplined good nature. The Star Wars universe has no doubt, makes sure the existence of force and it is proved in all the skills displayed by the knights, it has the Force not as a god, but as something that connects everyone and made them everything. The trips are simple in hyperspace! I think George Lucas portrayed much our world in Star Wars, however left the dark side of the force less obscure than ours.",

My father had no chance to refuse my bid to go and watch this film. We got the last two tickets and what followed was so overwhelming that I can't put it into words to describe it adequately. And I never forgot this feeling. Whenever I watch this film I see it through my children's eyes. So my comment is everything but not the slightest touch objective. For my present day view this gave me an unequaled gift. Whenever I watch a movie and it gives me the faintest feeling of what I felt there it's a very good one for me.

Here is my get well formula for everything from stomach flu to the common cold. One you obviously need to have the movie ready to watch on your television. Two have a warm bowl of chicken noodle soup (crackers are optional). Three you must drink a lemon-lime flavored soft drink (I'm avoiding using name brands here). After the soup and soft drink are prepared begin the movie and immerse yourself into the soup the soda and the spirit that is ""Star Wars : Episode IV A New Hope"".

It just goes to show there's no accounting for taste ( or in this case lack of taste ). Was this film meant to be S.F, drama or comedy. The only redeeming feature in it's favour were the special effects. The plot (if there was one) was paper thin and the characters for the most part were totally unbelievable and shallow.

Even though I grew up watching films filled with new age technology and mind blowing effects 'Star Wars' still made me feel like I was in space, travelling through hyperspace and visiting new exotic planets. For a film released in 1977 its technology and special effect still feel out of this world. Through the years I've realized that not only is it a fun film but it also works perfectly in setting up this trilogy. It's a classic tale of good vs. evil and this simplicity is one of the ways it differs from other Sci-fi were often the plot gets out of hand which is why many films nowadays are over the top. I don't think 'Star Wars' is the best film in the franchise but it is my personal favorite.",

With its now classic scrolling text, it created a new genre of film - the space opera. Influenced by Joseph Campbell, Lucas created a space western that hadn't been re-created since in any serious way. Even the much loved Firefly never had the same cult following. Star Wars' timeless feel resides in its classic archetypes the white hats. black hats to boo, and a classic princess to be rescued. It has a John Ford feel, with comedic relief in the twin yin yang feel of the droids R2-D2 and C3P0, the teacher with Obiwan, the lovable rogue Han Solo, the sidekick with a heart of gold Chewie, the student Skywalker and the love interest with a kick Lea. This is one film series that will end up outliving us all.",
1113,21 May 2019,nirome,9, Space Opera that signalled the beginning of an Era,"So many things have been said about this movie over the years, that's difficult to even know where to begin. The brainchild of a certain George Lucas and a clear homage to the Space Adventure serials of the 40s, this movie captured the essence of what it is that we want to see every time we go to the movies. It's a dazzling visual spectacle, sprinkled with a little bit of mythology, and populated with an array of well written and engaging characters. Everything from production design, visual and practical effects, to an immensely popular score by John Williams, that along with his forays with Spielberg (Jaws, Indiana Jones, E.T..) is recognized the world over. It was also the introduction of one of the most popular villains in cinematic history, Darth Vader. His threatening and imposing physical presence coupled with the voice of James Earl Jones, made him the ultimate Star Wars villain that, even to this day, hasn't been matched in the Star Wars lore. That aside, it's an incredibly simplistic story but very well told ( although a big part of the merit goes out to Marcia Lucas, who apparently saved the movie on the editing table). This movie created a fan base and cult following, nowadays only matched by that of the MCU fan base, and helped define the term Blockbuster. So many scenes of this movie have been etched into the minds of the fans; those iconic shots of the Skywalker homestead on the desolate planet Tatooine, the introduction of Han Solo in an Intergalactic bar, which is clearly a homage to the Western genre, the first time we get to see Darth Vader, the looming presence of the Death Star, the iconic last battle... I could go on and on about the cultural and cinematic importance of this movie. Needless to say, if you can get a hold of a copy of the unaltered version of this movie, before the infamous changes made by Lucas for the 1997 re-release , that's surely the best way to enjoy it. As it was originally intended. Great movie and something that should be in everybody's watch list.",
1114,19 November 2013,stb-e-newworld,9, One of the greatest movies of all time.,"I think this movie is fantastic. Especially the Theatrical Releases, the ones George Lucas didn't mess with. The story is a classic tale. a modern fairy tale. With a farm boy who sets off on an adventure after his last family is gone (well there is still his father *MAJOR SPOILER* Darth Vader *MAJOR SPOILER*). He must fight against the evil Galactic Empire. It is just one of those movies you can put yourself into and feel the action and the feelings your meant to feel. It is a true classic. Of course George can't take all the credit for this fantastic movie. It has a great by John Williams and fantastic acting by Sir Alec Guinness, Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrey Fischer, and we can't forget R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). Even though the movie may be oldish, the effects hold up even to todays standards, in fact I think they look better than most effects we see today!

You can see all that pain he had is still there after 20 years. Han and Leia have a wonderful banter,it's hard not to fall for them right away. I do find the part with R2D2 and C3PO a bit tedious but other then that it's very well paced. The music is amazing and is so memorable. I'm not old enough to have seen this in theatres but I remember watching this on VHS many times. I loved Princess Leia and wanted to be just like her. Even watching this movie years later I still do!

The lightsaber duel was kinda pathetic compared to the more recent lightsaber duels. There was some emotion in it, I'll give it that but other than that the lightsaber duel felt like a rather serious insult to Vader and Kenobi's actual power and made them seem like regular humans.

But, this was very different. The older movies had the words moving slowly and evenly from the bottom of the screen to the top. This film moved the words from front to back, using perspective to make it appear that they were disappearing into space, like a space ship flying away. The opening scene appeared to be earth, but I soon realized that there were two suns, not one. Then, I heard laser firing sounds and a large spaceship came across the screen.

The idea for Star Wars came from director George Lucas, who had written an incredible screenplay about ""a galaxy far, far away..."" Lucas' draft was rejected by many major film studios before 20th Century Fox finally agreed to distribute the movie. And thank god for that! George Lucas was to direct, Gary Kurtz was producing and Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher was playing our beloved leads! The film was shot with a tight schedule and limited budget, and the movie was masterfully edited, scored and visualized! After many commercials, we are back to the summer 1977! The film collected rave reviews, and ultimately grossed over 750 million dollars! The film went on to win 7 Oscars in the technical category, including Best Original Score, having lost the in the major categories to Annie Hall. ",

Watch the original, not the remastered rubbish.The most iconic Science Fiction film of all time ever. The cast of characters includes some of the coolest and funniest in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe. Mark Hamill, THE Joker, is full of passion and strength while Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the run from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the coolest looking character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the coolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start to feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that booming voice.",

The music, the set design, the shot composition, the special effects, and the pacing are all excellent. Is the dialogue a little rough around the edges? Sure. Does it matter? Not at all! This is a sci-fi fantasy film from the get-go, and it never tries to be anything else. This film is meant to be fun, it's not meant to be a hyperrealistic drama. Some scenes that I think particularly stand out are Luke looking out on the twin suns of Tatooine, and the entire cantina sequence. Both of those scenes are so well done, and could easily pass as a modern production.",

This Obeone Kanobi quote makes & Darth's slaying him, makes his character like Christ in Ben Hur as Kanobi dies & then his spirit lives on in the force against the Empire.....A New Hope was just that for the American movie goer as this film represented a new hope that films are made which entertain & stimulate the imagination. George Lucas accomplished this & set the stage for much more with this movie. While the film had to be done on a tighter budget than the rest of the series, this made the acting & script more important in this film than in the others. This film made us want more. The climatic Death Star Raid sequence is arguably one of the best battle sequences ever in a science fiction film......it grips the audience with the fate of the rebellion in the balance. When I first saw this film, the great counter balance was with C3PO & R2D2 as robots behaving like comic relief from all the serious acting going on around them. This balance is important in making this film entertaining too, though is often over-looked by film critics. This film created a hero for a whole generation of film fans, even 2 generations now.",

Watching this movie reminds me of precisely what makes the cinematic experience so wonderful.  Some people go one way and talk about the poor acting or the stock characters, but what they forget or ignore is that this is possible the most purely, thoroughly entertaining film ever.  And that it certainly is- it's an escapist movie.

It is fair to say my opinion may be compromised, however I feel that episode IV is a well executed tragedy with carefully placed cinematography that amplifies the essence of this story. Forgiving all special effects and fantasy settings, this is a classic Greek tale of tragedy and triumph against the gods. Many other films become centered on the detail of each moment rather than the purpose of the characters and the story. Episode IV is well centered in its direction and never strays from the point.

I had already seen Episodes 5 and 6 and when I saw this one I still felt that it was missing something. I can say now that people should not be considering this to be a movie.

1182,20 April 2020,Avery-WanSacritic,10, Fun for Everyone,"Whoever you are, this movie is a must-see. If you are not a fan of sci-fi, to each their own, but I highly suggest taking a chance by watching this movie. I do not care if you are nerdy or jocky, male or female, rich or poor, happy or sad, short or tall, or somewhere in the middle of all those, take a chance and watch this movie. If you are unaware, this movie beat the odds and changed the industry forever. However, before I tell you why, let us first talk about the story. I have never seen a film make use of Joseph Campbell's hero's journey more effectively and iconically than ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"". Other movies that follow the hero's journey are, for example, ""The Matrix"" (1999), ""Spider-Man"" (2002), and ""The Lion King"" (1994). All of which are superseded by ""Star Wars: Episode IV"". Within this story consists of great characters. There is the young farmer boy who will save the galaxy; a cocky pilot with a furry friend; two comical droid tag-alongs; a princess in distress who is a strong, influential female lead; an all-around menacing villain that is one of the coolest bad guys anyone would cheer on; appealing armies that duke it out in a now-or-never battle. You will fall in love and feel for these characters. Also, it takes more than engaging characters to make the movie. It takes great actors to bring the characters to life. To name just a few, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, David Prowse/James Earl Jones, Peter Cushing, Sir Alec Guinness all did outstanding jobs adding depth and emotions to their respective characters. Now, this movie faced substantial opposition from multiple areas. I will say the most resistance came from people who thought this movie would flop. Not only just thought it would, executives and viewers of early cuts expected it to bomb. Even George Lucas, who is the director and writer of the movie, was so sure it would crash and burn! (Note: Steven Spielberg predicted it to be successful) Another opposing force was the movie's funds. First of all, the movie had a low budget of $8 million (was then bumped up to $11 million). Second of all, over half of that was spent on never-before-done special effects. Not to mention, scenes that used those special effects were later scrapped. Third of all, on a more individual level, George Lucas agreed to receive a lower salary for 100% merchandising rights (this was seen as a fool's gamble, especially with ""Doctor Dolittle"" (1967) failing miserably at merchandising sales). But, by golly, the movie was a success. Not just any other successful movie, but a huge success! Despite screening in a mere 32 theatres on opening day, it raked in $1.554 million over the weekend and has since made over $700 million in the worldwide box office profit. Remember that unwise gamble George Lucas accepted? Lucas not only reaped millions of dollars in profit but also forever changed how movies merchandise! Hopefully, this helps in your decision to watch this movie because this is truly a remarkable movie from start to finish. Just within the first few seconds of the film, you will see the classic line ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..."" Then, the audience is hit by something like a figurative truck when the beautiful ensemble of musical genius flows like a river of chocolate into your ear canals, all while the audience is reading engaging backstory that is necessary to understand the beginning of the movie. Mix the music and the opening crawl to produce nearly uncontrollable excitement and anticipation for the gold the audience is going to find by watching the film. I have seen this movie countless times, and it never gets old. It is a solid film, and I cannot find any fault with it. Therefore, I give ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" a perfect rating.",

True, it is set in a different galaxy with beings different than us, but I think the main emphasis is the story and not the setting.  Lucas and the screenwriters did a fantastic job creating a believable world.  The Force is the most intriguing concept.  It is a religion, really.  I just saw Lucas' interview on Rosie today.  I knew I'd been reading the right meaning into the story! God is Love!  This is a story about a conflict between genuine good and evil.  It's about a fall from grace and finally, redemption.

The original release of Star Wars was absolutely perfect.  Everything that hit the cutting room floor needed to be there.   Han should have shot first.  Not Greedo.

Now, I love this film, however I can't consider myself a HUGE SW fan like other people, yes I have seen all the movies, played plenty of games and even saw some of the TV series, but I have not seen any comic or book from the Expanded Universe and while I love Star Wars, I don't hold it as this ""absolute flawless god-like master piece"" but more like a great franchise, with highs and lows and that have given me a lot of enjoyment through the years, A New Hope or as it was called back when it first came out ""Star Wars"", was the beginning of this franchise, back when George Lucas was a small name in the industry, the movie is great, however it does have a few problems, but they can be easily overlooked considering both the time the movie came out and the tons of problems it had behind cameras, the movie has a simple story, a Princess kidnapped by an evil empire and the hero with a sword has to rescue her, it's a pretty standard journey of the hero story, but it actually works really good in this film, the characters are all memorable, they started with flaws but you see their evolution through this film and even through the series, the music.... what can I say here? Is arguably the most iconic movie score of all time, Williams created a musical master piece that people love to this day, I guess the only complains you could pick are the light saber between Obi Wan and Vader, which has aged quite a bit, but again, knowing the amount of problems the film had behind the scenes, you kinda have to forgive it. There isn't much I can say about this film because... everyone has already said it, this is a film that inspired many people and remains one of the most iconic franchises of all time and with good reason",

1194,15 December 2021,Checkboard,10, Wrong Hero. :),"This is a story a brave girl who, despite her privilged upbringing, at the age of 19 ran for and won a popular election to the Senate. Upon arrving there, she realised the corrupt nature of the failing government and, horrified at the doomsday death weapons they were developing, managed to secretly contact and join a rebel alliance. Rising to command the rebels in her sector, while still holding her position as a Senator, she orchistrated the theft of the technical specs for that weapon and began transporting those specs to an attack base. Along the way she was intercepted - but in the midst of battle revised her plan on the fly and spirited the plans away, also recruiting a retired general to continue the delivery of those plans. Captured by the enemy and tortured in prison she was then forced to watch her home destroyed, her friends and entire family murdered. When that retired general, accompanied by a bumbling farm boy, initiate a failing rescue she takes control of that failure, turns it around and leads that group to freedom. She is then the only person who realises that the ship they are on is being tracked (due to the lack of fighter pursuit) and forms another plan, leading her enemies to a counter ambush. Briefing and Commanding the counter-forces personally she develops the attack for that counter ambush which succesfully destroys a doomsday weapon of immense horror.",

When you get down to it though it's not the story that's what makes it great, it's the way it's told in a original way that's never been told and you can see the passion that George Lucas put in to it and you can't help but appreciate it. If I had to say one negative thing is that the effects are dated but however with everything else being so good, I just ignore and just be entertained and appreciate it. Overall grade= A",

1203,2 November 2015,troubledyouth66,10, Starwars how it should have been done...,"Star wars 1-iii sucked, my brother who passed away thought so too. I think maybe he saw the last 3 movies then took a breather. Anyways, If they did Starwars 1-3 Ala 1989-93 then Kirchner would have directed with Robocop2, Predator 2/Terminator, graphics inspired by Ridley Scott and HR Giger I would turn my head and look. At least clone wars would have been done correctly. Then you would have two wins. A still youthful cast to cont the franchise via the best comics in history. That's right I bought Jedi Knight Dark Empire i &ii during those times. Luke joins the dark side...the emperor is cloned...the introduction of world destroyers and tie phantoms, the empire is hurt a little. The clone bats are destroyed, Anakin Solo is born. Obviously at the end of the novel, the Jedi are rising or winning even if Pinnacle moon was destroyed. I highly doubt an advanced civilization like that would just crumble and fall. They would get singed at the end, that's it. So they should have winged it, do 1-3 and 7-9 in the years before computers. Models=automatic win, harder but better. Pull off a harry potter with dark empire i-ii. Make the final movie like how you see it today, remove phantom menace and ROTJ completely from existence, or at least make it rots, a little more darker (not for kids..dark). Make phantom menace in the tradition of a new hope. Have attack of the clones as another win, change title to the Clonewars..or make the cartoon into a live action series idk. Make rots as a win or lose (rotj felt like an ultimate win, puppet wars however the good guy wins throughout the movie, making it not to believable, hence the empire is millions strong, they would just reform which they did). Rename 3rd movie as rise of the empire since it felt the empire should be rising and you have a compilation. Phantom menace lost bad, it was like phantom menace with a race scene. Remove the race scene, put like an escape scene again. Darth maul needs to be more hostile, he needs to be the Bobba Fett before Boba Fett arrives and returns via a Sarlac Pitt. Also Jango Fett could clone himself, but maybe black market some alien's blood instead. It makes sense if the alien is intelligent in form etc. A modern Jesus, or a race of giants, I don't really know. ",

1205,19 November 2015,charleswjoke,10, Nostalgia,"I hope the newer generation loves this film. Its a classic story but it is executed to perfection. The old mentor, the impatient hero, the sassy princess, the charismatic smuggler, the menacing general, the imperialistic soldiers, the funny side characters... its all here and its fantastic and its in space. This film doesn't ask too much from the audience, it just expects you to enjoy the ride, an intergalactic struggle of wills and politics. The special effects aren't much compared too what we expect these days but are used in such a way that they aren't noticeable. The story moves in such a way that we aren't bored and are always on our feet expecting different things from the plot, but knowing that our heroes will be OK as the cosmos moves in such a way that will guarantee their survival. Indeed, this is one of those films where the story will end with a nihilistic destruction go the rebellion. The story proves that hope is still present in a galaxy far away and long ago.",

He has created characters that you learn to love because of their importance in the world. And then he blows up a big space station. What more is there! This film has created a cult following due to the fact that every thing in the movie has a back story. You discover why these people feel the way they do and why they are like the way they are.

From the way films are made and special effects are done, to the way it changed marketing and merchandising forever, Star Wars has become the defining example of pure blockbuster fantasy. It is a pleasure to watch as much for its ability to take us to new worlds and tap into our imaginations as it is a revolution in creative and inspired storytelling.

Star Wars serves something for everyone from the hijinx of C-3PO and R2-D2, to the mystical powers and introduction of the force, this movie has it all.  Sir Alec Guiness, although he didnt intend to do so, will always live on as Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Many people feel the same for other performers in this movie, and the rest of the Star Wars Saga.  I call this the ""James T. Kirk"" sydrome.  (of course named after William Shatner's role in ST years eariler, one of the first actors to forever be immortalized into a single role).

You really can't understand or argue it's effects on the movie industry unless you lived through it--even if you hate it--if you like one single sci-fi, western, action, adventure, fantasy, or epic movie that has come out since it's debut, then you need to tip your helmet to ""Star Wars"".

This two hours of brilliance and magic is two hours well spent. I have loved this movie for more than have my life, and it never gets old. When two droids escape a Reble cruiser that was under attack by the evil Empire land on a remote planet calle Tatoninne the adventure begins.  One of these two droids, R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), carries the technical read-outs of the planet-sized Death Star which has the fireing capibilities to destroy a planet.  R2 must get the planes to Obi-Wan Kenobi (Sir Alec Guiness), and then get safley to Aldrean.  Along the way R2 and his counter-part C3P-0 (Anthony Daneiels) get capitured by scavengers called Jawas, and then sold to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammiel) and his uncle Owen.  Eventualy Luke, 3P-O, and R2 find Obi-Wan, and discover that Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is being held capitive by the empire and the evil Darth Vader (David Prowse) aboard the Death Star.  The four hire Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and his co-piolet Chewbaca (Peter Mahew) to take them to Alderan in Solo's star ship the Mellinum Falcon.  When they reach Alderan they see it's been completly obliterated by the Death Star.  The 6 are then captured and then go about the space station to find Leia.  If I say much more I'll spoil the ending, altough if you haven't already seen it you haven't been on this planet. The acting , story-telling, directing, score, and suspense is superb. Sir Alec Guiness is great as the wise old jedi-knight, Mark Hammiel is exelent as a winey young farm boy, Harrison Ford is superb as a daring scounderl, and Carrie Fisher un-beatible as a sort of bratish princess who is in charge of the Rebelion against the Empire.

I will be pilloried for saying it, but 'Star Wars' is just not deserving of the hype attributed to it. To say it is a fun film, fine. To say it was visually dazzling, great. But to proclaim from the treetops that it is the pinnacle of film, and that we should all bow down and worship the mighty Lucas for creating this wonder is simply dumb. Lucas set out to do two things: A) pay homage to the old Buck Roger's serials, and B) utilize the basic storytelling archetypes from the myths of old. (Joseph Campbell can tell you more about those than I). I feel he accomplished both of these goals. Unfortunately, he failed to insert an intelligent story along with it. For all those who say that film should be merely lighthearted entertainment, I say balderdash. You only think that because you've been brought up on things like 'Star Wars', which is just mindless laser battles and funny robots (nowhere near as good as its successor, 'The Empire Strikes Back', a film I really enjoy).",

I'm gonna talk about both. 1. the characters: the characters are great. the character development and interaction are mostly good. from the characters the best one is Harrison ford's Han solo. he's really the classic cynical antihero which creates funny situations when interacting with the more hero type characters such as Luke or princess Leia. Darth Vader is also menacing but he's really just the appetizer for the sequels. the other characters are also good in their own way but Han solo and Vader are the best ones 2. the villain(s) and action: this movie has both a singular and a collective villain. the singular villain is the dark lord Darth Vader. he's as said a very menacing character with near endless power and resources. but they kept him more tamed to shine more later. then there's the collective villain of the whole empire (and storm-troopers). they suck. every scene where the main characters have shootouts with the storm-troopers are boring because there are 0 stakes since (after the Vogons) the storm-troopers are the (second) worst shooters in the galaxy. which means there is no tension and i don't feel anything. the storm-troopers are such bad villain(s) that it's basically a pop culture joke by now. 3. the story: the story is fine. it's simple but effective. though a problem i've had is that there are some huge coincidences. for example: the robots which hold the information about the death star got very coincidentally on a planet which obi wan happens to be in and even before got in the possession of (the) Luke Skywalker. but those are probably very minor problems. the rest of the story is good. it's the classic hero saves the princess. except it's set in future and in space. i guess that's clever. though the story and the movie (most likely intentionally) don't go much far into the whole big story. there is no Yoda and Jabba the hut is just barely mentioned. not too much happens. and compared to ,,Empire Strikes Back'' it's really weak. summary: an enjoyable entertaining movie though with some flaws is definitely not bad but the fans still overrate it with the entire series.",

1245,27 April 2012,dandare4479,10, Star Wars - The film that changed everything,"Star Wars is one of the most important films Hollywood has ever produced, it marked a huge turning point in the way films were made and marketed. George Lucas struggled for years to make this film happen, he is a true visionary of cinema and people should never forget that. His ambition and creative mind allowed the world of Star Wars to come to fruition. To me Star Wars is Cinema, it has the classical story of rescue the princess but set in space. However it is the way that George Lucas told the story, amazing visual effects, bombastic sound, mythical plot points merged with very likable characters, all of which was refreshing for Hollywood in the late 70's, people were entertained again. The 70s were a special decade for film, many great modern classic films were produced by Hollywood's younger talent, Spielberg, Scorsese, Coppola, Ridley Scot, De Palma, Kubrick. But Star Wars created hysteria on a global scale and is unlikely to ever be seen again on this level. So to George Lucas thank you very much for giving us Star Wars and influencing so many of the great blockbuster film makers we have today including James Cameron and Christopher Nolan, without Star Wars Hollywood would be a very different place.",

Yes, Han did shoot first, but he was told he was going to be killed, so what's the problem George?

The plot is simple mythology with a futuristic sheen and the effects are superb BUT as a film it spelled the start of an era of big budget action pictures where effects (with Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic leading the way) too often replace characterization. The acting is a triumph of gusto and delivery over script-writing and though it remains one of the most important films of the 20th century, it simply isn't the same as when I watched it as an innocent 8 year old.",

This film deserves some respect in the cinematic universe. There are iconic characters in Skywalker, Vader. With that being said doesn't mean that a new hope is a script masterpiece. Even the film opens up with a gaping plot hole that can't be ignored. Droids getting away from the most feared organization in the galaxy with plans that would doom them and it is casually blown off by the empire? That wouldn't happen. We have a protagonist that doesn't cry when he discovers his beloved caregivers are brutally murdered andddd desecrated. What was in the script? Luke feels bad? We also have a princess who also reacts generically when she witnesses the empire destroy a planet? We have a space opera and not much emotion. What Lucas is? A special effects genius who brought the world his visionary saga but a new hope is hardly hard hitting in other areas. I am an avid star wars fan even at some point was a purist but have changed over the years. A new hope is remarkable for it's time and respect is given for the iconic characters as well. I can't merely rate it on nostalgia though it is a fun space fantasy film, but it is a flawed movie.

1280,7 January 1999,Gen S2rt,10, The movie that changed the standards of film-making forever.,"Before the mid 1970's, special visual effects weren't really made to look as real as life, because it was just commonly accepted that it was not possible, so what are you going to do.  In 1975, ""Jaws"" was a film with better special effects overall than anyone had seen before, and when ""Star Wars"" was released two years later, it took these latest advancements of special effects into space, where it would change the way people looked at special effects.  Obviously it wasn't exactly as real as it would look if it were actually happening, and it may have had some noticeable flaws, but it did take the first step towards the realistic special effects we see today. If not for ""Star Wars"", people would have continued using the special effects that were just enough to give you the gist of what was supposedly happening.  Because of the fact that these effects, though cutting-edge at the time, would be dated now, the ""Special Edition"" was released in 1997 in order to maintain its impressiveness, with updated special effects that are as impressive by today's standards as the originals were in 1977.  Although some people thought the story itself was pretty corny, I think it appealed to people with open minds.  After all, that has always been the basic purpose of science fiction.  The ""force"" is the reason for the most part that some people feel this way, but I don't think it is as ""out there"" as some people do.  One thing the force can supposedly be made to do is telekinesis, which has obviously been thought of before because there's a word for it.  Not that anyone really takes the force seriously in real life, but I doubt anyone can go out and prove conclusively that it doesn't exist in any form, so it doesn't suspend THAT much disbelief.  There is some really good acting in the film, such as Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), but I believe the most notable performance is Darth Vader (James Earl Jones).  Vader is one of not very many movie villains that has been remembered for so long, and he is one that can really scare an audience with his presence.  John Williams' music for him does a good job of representing how ruthless he is, although the famous ""Imperial March"" wasn't introduced until ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980).  ""Star Wars"", although it was the first to be released in the series, is actually part four of a six chapter saga.  The reason this was the first film to be released is because it is really the only one that starts out in such a way that you can get away with not already knowing the story so far, and also has a happy ending with relatively few loose ends. It was because writer/director George Lucas was not sure how well it would do in the box-office or if he'd be allowed by 20th Century Fox to complete the trilogy since it was new ground for filmmaking that he made this decision.  He did, however, leave enough loose ends that could be expanded into the rest of his already conceived saga just in case the film was as successful as his friend Steven Spielberg was confident it would be.  As it turned out, despite the setback of having a pretty small budget, it was more successful than Lucas imagined.  I don't understand the fact that so many people are obsessed with every little detail of ""Star Wars"" and know every little trivial fact about these films, nor do I with all the ""Star Trek"" fans, but I did think the movie was great, as well as the movies that followed it.  It's too bad that a science fiction movie this spectacular will never win an academy award (or be nominated, for that matter) for ""best picture"", but it seems no science fiction or horror film ever will just because too many people consider such films automatically unworthy just because of its genre (especially horror), but if ever a science fiction film deserved one, it would be ""Star Wars: A New Hope"".  If you're someone who doesn't like science fiction, then this film might not make much of an impression on you but if you are one of the few sci-fi fans who hasn't seen this film, then although you may have missed it in the theater where it was much more amazing than it could be on video, you'd better see this film, then the others if you want to know what science fiction has been all about all these years.",

The film isn't some kind of ""high art"" or something.  The best sci-fi film out there is by far 2001.  Then Dr. Strangelove.  Star Wars isn't sci-fi.  It's part western, part myth, part legend.  But not sci-fi.  It's not a pioneer in special effects. 2001 is. Whoever said that ""nothing in the following years is better"" is wrong.  I believe you said that Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark were not better. That's your opinion, but Jaws was made before Star Wars. I like art films.  2001, Psycho, The Godfather.  My favorites.  And, although I enjoyed Star Wars, it is not correct to call it the greatest film ever.  The acting is horrible, and the characters are lame.  Han Solo is the only good character (besides Anakin, and maybe Obie-Wan) because he is flawed.  Luke is barely flawed, and the few flaws he had disappeared within the first fifteen minutes of the movie. Leia isn't flawed at all.  Good characters are flawed, severely.  Norman Bates (Psycho), Micheal Corelone (The Godfather), The Human Race (2001: A Space Oddyssey).  All flawed.  Great stories have flawed characters.  It's always been like that.

Not because of great acting, not because of a great script, but just because it is pure fun.  Everything about this movie is enjoyable; the plot is a good old adventure story, where an unlikely hero saves the galaxy.  However, even with it's standard plot, Star Wars catapults itself to a higher level than most adventures.  First off, it has amazing special effects for its time. Even though it was made for only $10 million (pennies compared to some of today's blockbusters), it still shines through with very well-done visuals, especially with some of the alien costumes.  Needless to say, this movie inspired an incredible cult following, as well as four sequels, two Ewok T.V. movies, a horrendous Christmas Special, and too much merchandising to count.  All in all, this is just one of those movies that I like to watch over and over again, one that almost grows better and better with each viewing.",

Its impact is undeniable and massively boosted the interest of the science fiction genre. This whilst film is very much enjoyable I would say it is to to an extent quite overrated. The prequels are not the only Star Wars films to be affected by Lucas' bad dialogue. Its when one consume such media that was sourced as inspiration the the film it is far from unnoticeable that large aspects where copied. This is by no means in a manor of plagiarism but rather as a homage. Many people have compared the film to that of the like of Kubricks 2001 - a space odyssey but personally I reject such comparison, with perhaps exception of its influence on visual effects. Firstly they are two vastly different films 2001 being a science fiction whereas star wars being more of a space fantasy. The other is the quality of the visual effects. Whilst the quality is overall remarkable for the period, 2001 has aged much better, with Star Wars looking dated no matter what stupid ""remaster"" George Lucas does.

It has an intriguing story, action, humor, romance, cool special effects (pre-CG, but way ahead of their time in 1977), a tremendous musical score and has moral lessons about greed, temptation, sacrifice and loyalty. Good and Evil are clearly defined and the fight of Good vs. Evil is the central theme. George Lucas and his extremely talented crew got everything everything right in this movie. The movie benefited from two previous Lucas projects. THX-1138 and American Graffiti. STAR WARS blended Lucas' interest in technology with warm, human, defined characters.

One might draw parallels with other epic undertakes as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, for example. Is it fair to review a single movie as an independent story, when actually much of what transpires from it (or to it) is directly linked to crucial motifs in a story that spans for six movies? Not only that but in the particular case of this movie (episode), we have reached half way in the story, with the first act of the saga completed in the earlier episode (Revenge of the Sith), giving this movie the job of linking the two trilogies together.

The story is absolutely awesome everyone watching it is backing Luke and wanting everyone on the millennium falcon to triumph. One of the best parts of this film is the universe that it puts you in and the different species/people you get to meet along with all there separate stories. The only problem with the movie to me is some of the acting in the film, it really isn't the best it could be but with the places and scenes the characters are in, the acting isn't ever unbelievable or bad enough for you to loose interest in the characters.

1317,31 August 2020,Mr-CCS-06,10, A ground breaking piece of work that is easily the best SciFi movie of the 70s.,"It's safe to say that the age of cinema has updated in the 1970s. We did have many SciFi movies and TV shows in the past. Movies included Stanley Kubric's 2001: A Space Odyssey(1968) and TV shows included Star Trek(1966). But it wasn't until the 1970s when we got huge cinema hits. The two big Science Fiction products of the 1970s included Ridley Scott's Alien(1979) and this movie. If I had to choose one, it would definitely be Star Wars. Also known as A New Hope, this movie kick started a huge franchise that still continues to this day. Directed by George Lucas, Star Wars brings us to a world that takes place a long time ago in a galaxy far far away where an ever raging war continues. Participating in that war are the Imperials, led by Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader, played by Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones, and the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher. When the Princess gets captured, farm boy of Tatooine Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill, is warned by two droids, played by Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker, that a desert hermit called Obi Wan Kenobi, played by Sir Alec Guinness, is the Rebles only hope. It turns out that Kenobi is actually a warrior called a jedi, who have long been thought dead after a massacre 19 years prior. After losing his aunt and uncle, played by Shelagh Fraser and Phil Brown, Luke decides he must go with Kenobi to help save the Rebel Alliance from certain doom. With the help of a pilot and his partner, played by Harrison Ford and Peter Mayhew, the group must save the princess and destroy the Empire's doomsday weapon before the galaxy is put through chaos. What can I say that hasn't been said before? This is honest to god one of the best movies ever made. It was ground breaking when it first came out, and still is today. Every time I watch Star Wars, I feel the 4 year old me jump out of my body and remind me how great the movie must've been to audiences who watched it back when it first came out. The characters are all great. Luke embodies a hero who doesn't know his destiny just yet, and his journey is just beginning. If only audiences knew what would come to him in the later movies. Princess Leia is a great character too. Although she is a typical damsel in distress, she stands up for herself and fights alongside her group. Han Solo and Chewbacca (Chewie) is one of the greatest movie duos of all time. The fact it spreads over 30 years is absolutely amazing. And Obi Wan Kenobi, C-3PO and R2-D2 will always be the simple characters that define SciFi for me. But of course, there's the villain. While he is the most popular character, Darth Vader is by far the best character in this movie. He is the character that has been in the most movies in the franchise, and that is why I love him. We get an entire story line over the course of over 40 years(including Star Wars:The Clone Wars). Although he is barely in this, he still makes an intimidating figure that stays with us in this world of pop-culture. As for the rest of the characters, they are not in it much, but they leave an impression. Now for the visuals. While the movie has had a visual face lift since the original release, but what's left of the original visuals still leave the impression of 70s cinema for me. The sound effects by Ben Burtt still make me smile and you can find me mimicking them on any day I'm in the Star Wars mood. And finally, we have the emotions. They can range from cheery, to suspense, to even sadness. And that's another reason why this movie is what it is for me, it balances many emotions all at once. So overall, if you have not seen Star Wars, I recommend you take the spare time you have, make some popcorn, and enjoy this eye popping masterpiece that should be loved for years to come. 10/10",

I think I can pinpoint the moment I ""became a woman"" to when Han Solo usurped R2-D2 as my favorite character. It's not just that it's Harrison Ford at his hottest with a super sexy wardrobe (that vest! the little jacket he wears in Cloud City!), but the fact that he's a rebel struggling with the fact that he's found a cause and a group of people he can care about. Practically everyone in Hollywood tried out for the role of Han Solo including Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson, and Bill Murray! But Lucas finally went with Ford, despite originally being dead set against using an actor he had worked with before. I think what makes Ford an ideal Han Solo is the fact that he really wasn't taking anything too seriously. This gives Solo a cocky but sweet vibe that is completely lovable. He purposely didn't rehearse his line for the scene where he must stall over the intercom in the detention block so it would seem spontaneous. It's such a fun, cute moment and it makes you realize how important it is to have the right cast. http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/03/02/star-wars/",

Lucas also wanted to make the the fighters dive zig zag and spin.
And of course a film featuring futuristic technology couldn't be complete without a technologically advanced camera.

I kick myself for being so unapprieciative when I was younger, since If i had payed attention I would have bought right into it and had some valuable collector toys to go along with some fantastic childhood memories of this classic, timeless fairy tale about a poor boy, who grows up underprivledged only to find out he's a prince who's destined to be a jedi knight.

Just one example of this dire movies trademark is the 40 second panning technique, which everyone knows, when used in the wrong context (not too mention poor lighting) only drags the film into anti-climatic sequences with little reward for the viewers patience. the poor use of English grammar is also abundant with the Cookie being most guilty of this crime .... i for one could not understand a word that this thing said , and yet i am supposed to believe that the rest of the cast could as they freely reply with so called humour to his comments. I could comment as to how bad the casting is in much length; for the sake of time i will merely mention just what a terrible choice Harrison ford was. HARRISSON FORD??? why, when there are so many other talented actors out there, delroy lindo for example would have been superb as the swaggering space pirate Han solo. also , who made the crazy decision to replace the voice for Darth Vader to James earl Jones , when anyone who knows anything knows that the Cornish accent is brimming with menace and merely chose to steal proses finest hour. the plot is a complete pile of contrived rubbish as of the like i have never seen in any sci-fi, for instance anyone with only a rudimentary knowledge of alpha based gravitational upper physics would know that the destruction of a planet would have serious ramifications for the Eco system of any star system within at least a billion flighty years (and par secs don't exist). as a closing comment: if you would like to view a truly outstanding piece of sci-fi cinema, with amazing special effects, humour, fantastic action, superb cast and thrilling plot, then i refer you to (the always awesome) ice pirates, starring the charismatic Robert Ulrich (froms TV's Vegas).",

This truly is a legendary movie in its own right, as well as one which revolutionized Hollywood - whether for good or ill depends greatly on one's point of view.",

Ive heard both good and bad things about the movie but the first time i saw this movie i couldnt believe they could even create such magic on the big screen. The plot, the characters, sound effects, special effects, the music...you name it. This movie had it all and i personally, along with millions of other fans, cannot wait for the sequels to come.",

I know i wasn't born when this came into theaters, but I do know that the special effects were AMAZING for that time. And the people that think this movie is lame are too new age. They think that modern special effects make a good movie.",

1349,30 May 2010,nickdelopes,10," Flawed, but Undeniably Great","Star Wars is an undeniably great film. It, perhaps more than any other movie before or since, truly defined the word ""epic"". What do we mean by ""epic""? We mean engrossing, inviting, and just plain real. Action movies nowadays never seem to be possible. They just seem to show technologies advances and provide us with plain eye-candy. Star Wars doesn't have that edge. Its special effects has stood the test of time, but it doesn't grip us anymore with the same effect it used to. And its other elements: its acting, its screenplay, its plot, are all rather ordinary.

1350,1 January 2011,ModKuraika,8," ""You must learn the ways of the Force.""","Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope was a landmark in the realm of sci-fi fantasy, special effects, and cinematic quality. I will not deny that I am a loving fan of the Original Trilogy. However, this film seems to be put on too big a pedestal, and people tend to ignore the pacing and sometimes rushed tone to it all. A good example of reference is Family Guy's Blue Harvest, a feature length special in which Family Guy spoofs the entirety of Episode IV. Haven't you ever noticed the truth in some of its particular jokes?",

Instead I get this - Star Wars is quite possibly the most overrated thing in existence, people will queue for days to watch it. The villain is a guy with what looks to be a pedal bin on his head. The main character - Luke - is a whiny brat. With Harrison Ford boring me out of my mind as Han Solo, maybe I'd have enjoyed it more if Al Pacino had taken this part. My advice to you would be to rent it, but if you're seriously into Science fiction, this should definitely be part of your collection",
1357,30 June 2020,chrislivings,6, Ultimately Disapointing.,I enjoyed the first half of this film the incredible opening with the giant space ship chasing the princess then one by one we are introduced to the characters the inventivness is wonderful from the hooded baddies to the robotic machines with there personalities Theres plenty of back story hinted at here in this imaginary universe with lots of mythology etc which would of been more interesting to explore. So for me the interest was lost after the princess gets rescued and Alec Guinness dies from then it's just becomes a shoot em up movie with the end ripped of from the dam busters.,

Watching a New Hope I was only slightly impressed but realized this is 45 years old for its time I'm sure it was spectacular. It was entertaining but confusing at times. I'll continue to watch the franchise I'm sure it'll grow on me.,

1362,3 August 2021,chillgang,6, Painfully average,"I never liked Star Wars, period. The fact that this movie got oversaturated and popular instead of Blade Runner or Twilight Zone Bewilders me to no end. The writing is basically above average. I expected more from a overwhelmingly popular series. The special effects are amazing, some of the best I've ever seen honestly. The movie stands the test of time, but so is Blade Runner, Blade Runner has better writing, better philosophy, better sci fi really everything better than Star Wars. And that movie fell under the shadow? And this is coming from someone who never grew up with either.",

It was cutting edge when it hit the theaters and has a great story and terrific characters.  I cannot say enough about the quality and intensity of this film.  This is truly a unique experience and should be the first science fiction movie a person sees.  I give it a 10 out of 10.",
