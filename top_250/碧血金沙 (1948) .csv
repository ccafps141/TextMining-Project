0,10 August 2016,AlsExGal,9," Just a great movie all around, but a very dark tale","This film is a sharp-edged study of the effects of greed on otherwise normal men, and one man in particular: Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs. Dobbs and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) are down and out and meet up with prospector Howard (Walter Huston). When Dobbs wins a lottery, he uses the proceeds to finance a trip for the three to central Mexico to search for gold. ",/

2,6 April 2005,Nazi_Fighter_David,8, One of Warner Brother's triumphs of the forties,"Having had his day as an idolized star and romantic leading man, it was now time for Bogart to get down to the serious business of acting For eighteen years it had usually been Bogart playing Bogart in various shadings Now that Bogart was gone and in his place was an older and far less romantic figure, one who found new challenges and was able to meet most of them successfully This new phase of his continued growth began with a story of three men in search of gold ",e

4,3 January 2015,Hitchcoc,10, Great Character Actors...and No Stinking Badges,"Ever since ""Greed,"" I have loved movies about losers who destroy themselves and others. This is a classic example of the worst of that term as three men try to face off against forces over which they have little control. It's a little like an early ""Deliverance"" where the paranoia and fear and, yes, greed, conspire to take away what could have been quite lucrative. The performances, for me, of Bogart, and particularly Walter Huston, in a smaller role, make this worthwhile. This is the prototype for the Mexican bandito with his grin and his disregard for human life. The confrontation has become the basis for parody. The concluding scene is priceless with Bogart's facial expressions and the utter dismay it produces. So much has been said about this. Enjoy the ride.",i

This is an exceptional film for many reasons--most notably because it looks into the darker side of human nature--something you don't often see in films during this era.",e
6,7 September 2007,thinker1691,8," ""If you want somebody NOT to find it, . . . Put it in front of them""","In the 1920's, labor was hard to find. If you happened to be a laborer, work was almost non existent. Indeed, if you were unemployed and in Mexico, your chances were dismal. Yet, these were the times, which attracted many South of the border. The place was barren, yet many a fortune could spring up directly before you, . . .if you were luckily enough to see it. That is the story behind this incredible film. The legend of El Dorado was only one of the many myths which lured the adventurous to Mexico, another was ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre."" The gold of the Mother of Mountains was passed from father to son for generations. Thus when the film adaption was made, it was sure to be sculpted by men of vision. One such man is legendary John Huston who directed this film. Three common men are lured by the promise of discovering a lost treasure. The first is Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a nice enough guy who wants only to be fair, but is hungry to 'strike it rich.' The second is Howard, (Walter Huston) as honest as you expect him to be and a man of considerable experience. The last is Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) who if given a chance, will use it. The trio make a PAC to share and share alike all the treasure they find. However, only Howard is aware of what the possession of Gold can do to a man. To find the treasure, they need the mountain, some hard work, a little luck. To bring it home, will require something only one of them possesses. The film is a Classic and is due to the combined talents of all the stars and the director. If you look closely, you'll see Robert Blake (Barreta) and John Huston in brief roles. ****",w

13,1 June 2004,claudio_carvalho,10," A Tale of Greed, With Outstanding Direction and Performance of the Cast","In 1925, in Mexico, Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) is an American begging for food and trying to get any job. He meets Bob Curtin (Tim Holt), another American in horrible economical situation and also looking for job, and the former gold prospector Howard (Walter Huston), and together they go to the Mexican mountains seek for gold. After ten months of hard and tense work, including confrontation with bandits, each one of them gets a small fortune in gold. Meanwhile, their personalities are disclosed, and Dobbs shows himself a man obsessed by greed. The end of their journey is ironic and tragic. This movie is a masterpiece. Having an outstanding direction of John Huston, an astounding performance of Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt and supported by a fantastic screenplay, it is certainly one of the best movies ever, highly recommended for any audience. Walter Huston and Humphrey Bogart are really stupendous in their roles. My vote is ten.",4

The old-timer accurately predicts trouble, but is willing to go anyway. The film is fictional, but presents a very realistic scenario: By the 1920s the violence of the Mexican Revolution had largely subsided, although scattered gangs of bandits continued to terrorize the countryside. The newly established post-revolution government relied on the effective, but ruthless, Federal Police, commonly known as the Federales, to patrol remote areas and dispose of the bandits. Foreigners, like the three American prospectors, were at very real risk of being killed by the bandits if their paths crossed. The bandits, likewise, were given little more than a ""last cigarette"" by the army units after capture, even having to dig their own graves first.",3
15,18 December 2018,ksdilauri,10, 'Sierra Madre's' gold wasn't the only thing Bogart didn't get.,"The only thing I have to add to the many well-written reviews here is this: it's astounding that Bogart wasn't nominated in the Academy Awards' Best Actor category. Sure, he had his share of nods in other years, but his portrayal of the complex Dobbs is unique. Watch this classic-for many reasons-and see if Bogie's performance isn't Oscar-worthy.",1
16,10 June 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10, Yet another brilliant film from John Huston,"I love John Huston's films, and this is another one of my favourites. For one thing it is very well made, with wonderful cinematography and striking locations, and the story which is like a fable on greed and human despair as well as a fun search for gold in bandit-infested Mexico is very exciting. Max Steiner's score is superb, the screenplay is crisp and the direction from John Huston is rock solid. The acting is simply great, and that's an understatement with Humphrey Bogart giving another memorable performance as the drifter Fred C. Dobbs. And he is superbly supported by Tim Holt who plays a young idealist and especially Walter Huston as the gnarled prospector. Overall, just another brilliant film from a terrific director, with a superb opening and unforgettable ending. 10/10 Bethany Cox",4
17,21 January 2018,Fella_shibby,9," Bogart n Huston nailed it. One of my fav movie of all time, depicting human nature in an interesting way.","I first saw this in the early 90s. Revisited it recently on a blu-ray.
Treasure of the Sierra Madre is one of my favourite n in my opinion Bogart's best acting display.
Searching for gold has always been a popular film topic n this film has really nailed it with superb display of human nature.
Bogart is phenomenal in this film. In this film he is so full of paranoia, insanity n evil but u still feel pity for him. His grungy, unkempt n unshaven look added to the character.
The film has a dark tone dealing with human nature of greed, paranoia, evil intentions, insanity n ignorance but it has its share of laughs. Walter Huston's happy dance, Bogart's evil smile, Holt showing equanimity in adversity n Alfonso Bedoyas ignorant n illiterate attitude. The scene, where the character of Holt wondering whether to help his fellow colleague trapped inside the mine n his sympathy towards the widow's share of gold as well his infatuation with the widow by jus looking at the photo r all dealt very well in the film. The scene where the three characters are ready to kill the fourth one is indeed man's darkest nature.",/
18,8 November 2020,Coventry,8, Man. The most dangerous enemy known to ... man!,"I don't usually comment on non-horror cinematic landmarks, because it honestly isn't my area of expertise, and because - usually - everything that can and needs to be said about the films in question has already been published before. That's definitely also the case for John Huston's ""The Treasure of Sierra Madre"", so I'll try to keep the review brief. In the past four years (2016 - 2020), I often heard the phrase ""Make America great again"". Well, you know what would really help to accomplish this? Make great American movies again, like this one! It's a bona fide movie-monument from start to finish, with a compelling script, breath-taking locations, superb cinematography & music, and of course the stellar performances. Director/co-scripter John Huston and legendary lead actor Humphrey Bogart deserve our endless respect for their stubbornness, perseverance and bravery to have Bogart appear in such an atypical role for his status. Especially after his polished roles in films like ""Casablanca"", ""The Big Sleep"" and ""To Have and Have Not"", it must have been quite a shock for audiences to accept Bogart as a cold and cruel villain. Well actually, he isn't really a villain. Bogart depicts an initially sympathetic drifter who undergoes a transformation into a ruthless scoundrel due to greed and paranoia caused by ""gold diggers' fever"". And his performance is genius, as are those of Tim Holt and Walter Huston.",?

21,30 October 2009,sddavis63,8, A Powerful Statement About The Power Of Greed,"With its obvious warning about the consequences of greed, this film is surprisingly relevant today. True, we no longer suffer from the classic problem of ""gold fever."" Not many people go out free-lance prospecting anymore, but corporate greed is certainly much in the news and the economic collapse of late 2008 had at least partly at its root the problem of greed. This wonderful classic uses a more traditional setting, but manages to portray the same collapse of civilized behaviour and the problems that arise with simply looking out for Number 1. In this movie, that position is clearly held by Humphrey Bogart's Fred Dobbs, an American drifter in Mexico who hooks up with fellow drifter Curtin (Tim Holt) and ""old-timer"" Howard (Walter Huston). Together they decide to strike out into the mountains in search of gold, in spite of Howard's warnings about what riches can do to people - and gold they find.",f

23,20 December 2006,Quinoa1984,10, the Hustons and Bogart in a perennial story of money being the root of all evils- even in good men,"Fred Dobbs doesn't have a nickel to his name, at least when he's in the small Mexican village at the start of the Treasure of the Sierra Madre. But whatever the situation is, he wants what he can get, and if anyone tries to get in his way he'll let em have it. We see this early one when he and Bob Curtain have to beat it out of a sleazy boss at a construction site to get their earned wages. It's then no surprise that the two of them find it the best idea to take on Howard, an old seemingly-by-gone codger who once was a great prospector, on their ideal trip to look for gold in the mountains of Mexico. But then we start to see a kind of psychological head-trip go on with Dobbs, which makes the Treasure of the Sierra Madre that much more special of a film. The main characters aren't against any very dangerous adversaries- aside from the bandits- and it's not Cowboys and Indians. In fact, getting all the gold together isn't even the climax of the picture, which is usually where one might think a conventional picture would take this story. But John Huston, the director, has none of that here. In 'Sierra Madre', Dobbs becomes the ""bad guy"", but it's hard exactly to call him one. ",=

25,26 April 2004,directortom,10, What acting is all about.,"Although John Huston's directing is absolutely equal to the screenplay, winning Oscars for both, it is the performance level of the actors that makes ""Treasure of The Sierra Madre"" the classic film that it is. Beginning and ending with Walter Huston's award winning role of the worn-out old miner who is looking for one last big score, Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt are equal to the task and draw us in to this tale of need and greed. So convincing is Walter's portrayal of the seasoned old prospector, we come to believe that he is a gold digger by trade who only acts in movies so that he can dig and pan for gold again and again. His knowledge of mining and the lifestyle it demands and forces upon those who partake, is so thorough that Bogart and Holt seem like school kids in awe of a new hero. Of course, we know that his son John, did much research in preparation for writing the screenplay; but we are nevertheless plunged into a sure belief that this old miner must surely have been there age upon age, mine upon mine, and has therefore, a thousand tales to tell.",t

Amazing performances from all three leads. Walter Huston is just a treat to watch. One of the last great roles in his impressive career. Humphrey Bogart has what I think is his best non-heroic role here as the scummy Fred C. Dobbs. Tim Holt is saddled with a less meaty part than his two co-stars but still manages to deliver a great turn. Huston's script and direction are excellent. Max Steiner's score is terrific. There are so many wonderful scenes in this one. Of course, everybody remembers the ""stinking badges"" scene and the famous climax. It's a brilliant movie that stands among the best of its time.

32,19 July 2012,mark.waltz,10, Greed + Paranoia = Destruction!,"You know from the very beginning of this movie that Humphrey Bogart isn't the nicest guy. Whether it is panhandling to the same person (without even recognizing the person's face) or throwing a glass of water in a young Mexican boy's face for pestering him about buying a lottery ticket, Bogart's character is instantly recognized for being more than just disgruntled with society. He has every right to get angry when he is ripped off by boss Barton MacLane who hires him for a hard job then disappears without paying him. He's actually honest in spite of all this, beating MacLane up and taking only what is owed him rather than MacLane's entire bankroll. But when he agrees to go panning for gold with quietly moralistic Tim Holt and hyper grizzled old Walter Huston, his true nature comes out. The three all disagree on how much gold they want to collect before cashing it in, but when they come up with an agreement, Bogart's greed, previously just light, becomes paranoiac, and he begins to distrust his pals. Holt and Huston are basically decent men, but their malevolent nature is revealed when Bruce Bennett shows up and wants to get in on the action. Should they: 1: Kill him? 2: Send him away and risk him reporting them for mining gold without a license? or 3: Include him in. They are about to do #1 when bandits show up and they realize they need him.",

36,22 August 2021,kevin_robbins,9, This is a well done movie that deserves the 3 Oscars it received,"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) is a move I recently watched again for the first time in a long time off HBOMax. The storyline follows a group of poor friends who meet a man who thinks he can help them find gold. They pool their resources together to start this treasure seeking adventure and set-out to strike it rich. Lucky for them they find a prime location and accomplish their goal. They decide to divide their loot evenly but the more time goes by the more they become weary of each other's intentions. Can they become rich and succeed together or will their own internal doubts ruin it for all of them? This movie is directed by John Huston (The African Queen) and stars Humphrey Bogart (Casablanca), Walter Huston (The Beast of the City) and Tim Holt (Stagecoach). This cast is absolutely outstanding and their chemistry and ability to play off each was magnificent from the beginning to the end of the movie. The evolution of the characters is delivered to the audience perfectly. The storyline does a great job of how your mind can play tricks on you and cause you to see and feel things that do not exist. The circumstances are set-up and executed well which allows for a triumphant conclusion. Overall this is a well done movie that deserves the 3 Oscars it received.

37,29 January 2013,ironhorse_iv,8, This movie is the true treasure,"Based on German author B. Traven's 1927 novel with the same title, the movie has a great set on about men losing their sanity due to Greed. It's was create by Traven to blast the United States for coming to Mexico only to exploit the country's natural resources after the Mexican Revoultion left the country in ruins. It can also mirror what he felt about United States exploit European countries like Germany after World War I. The only problem is that nobody had the slightest idea who he was. Some people feel that B. Traven is a nom de plum, (Pen Name) as the author's true identity, nationality, and background have been hotly contested from the start, a literary guessing game surpassed only by the who-wrote-Shakespeare controversy. While it's never explain who is the man under the novel, it's clear as day that John Huston directed this movie. This John Huston film begins with Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a loner bumming off money from rich people and taking odd jobs at Tampico, Mexico in 1925. It's never explain why Fred Dobbs is there, broke or why there were so many poor Americans living in Mexico at that time, when it's clearly proved that United States was riding high at the time. In my opinion, Traven was a Anarchist, not fan of Capitalism and he use Fred Dobbs as a tool to show the wrongs of it. The audience is made to believe, that Fred Dobbs into might have came from America to Mexico due to some crime unexplained in his past, which would help explain why it was easier mislead by dreams of getting rich. Tired of getting rip-off for their hard work and naive nature, and not getting pay. Dobbs and his co-worker/friend Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) decide to join a grizzled old prospector Howard (Walter Huston) in search of gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Through enormous difficulties, they eventually succeed in finding gold, but bandits, the elements, and most especially greed threaten to turn their success into tragedy. The greed hits Dobbs hard, as it's turns into a Mammon type character. Dobbs is unreasonably afraid that he will be killed by his partners losing his trust, and always trying to see about killing them first because of the three lusting to possess the entire treasure. While Humphrey Bogart is awesome actor, his character is not the Indiana Jones hero that unknown people who haven't read the novel are thinking coming in this movie. Dobbs is a awful character who just get worst and worst with the gold. Dobbs isn't the hero, Howard or Curtin are more honorable to be label heroes due to them getting their redemption. I think Tim Holt got short shift for one of the great displays of acting in this movie. Huston makes the movie funny with his knee slapping dance while Bogat gives the movie it's dark side. Huston does a remarkable job of depicting the prospectors' collective slide into distrust and then outright paranoia. It's a American adventure story as a mythic battle between reason and madness. There are plenty of actions, from bar fights to shoot outs with Mexican bandits. In the bar fight, it's just amazes that the camera is so close and yet they use doubles so effectively. Put the guys face in shadow and it is amazing how you can not recognize his stunt double if not pausing the frame. The movie has a very interesting screenplay, and the film has a speech full of human psychology and people's reaction to greed. Gold doesn't change a man, it just reveals what he really is. This is a statement on value and finding out what or who you really are, and what is of real value. Best (inadvertent) summation of Adam Smith's "" Wealth of Nations "" in my opinion. The film is also known for it's famous one-liner about badges, or what I heard 'stinking badgers'. Yes, you don't want stinking badgers there. That would be bad. I don't know why it's famous, its rather funny than dramatic but it will always be special because of how Alphonso Bedoya says it. Once upon a time, Sierra Madre had the stigma of having been written by a Socialist. However, the film has a neutral philosophy and deals with the theme of human nature, rather than any particular message, so it get a pass. Check it out and tell me what you think of the film.",

40,31 March 2008,Lejink,8, Gold in them thar hills,"My dad has told me for years that this is one of his favourite films and he knows a good movie when he sees one. He wasn't wrong! As tough and uncompromising as the mountains from which the three protagonists attempt to extract the gold that will make their fortune, this unconventional, wholly unglamourous but riveting movie becomes almost a masterclass in production. The story engages from the start as do the characters and the situations that overtake them in their quest as they encounter an unwanted carpetbagger, rogue bandits and friendly Indians in turn, all of which significantly affect their respective fates. Bogart, long-haired and wild-looking, is at his best here in an unsympathetic role as the selfish and ornery Dobbs but it was Walter Huston, the director's father, who deservedly got the acting Oscar for his engaging portrayal of the world-weary but still perceptive old-timer who ultimately accepts with good grace the turnaround in their fortunes at the close and in truth is the only one to benefit materially as well as spiritually from the experience. Don't forget Tim Holt either, the little remembered third lead, who acts as an effective counterweight between Bogart and Huston and certainly isn't found wanting in the acting stakes. Huston's writing and direction are of course both of the highest standard, the script displaying an understanding of the motivations of desperate men while his direction prefigures Sergio Leone's predilection for characterful close-ups. He even has the courage to let a scene unfold spoken entirely in Spanish as further testimony to realism. There's also a great knockdown bar-room fight as Bogart and Holt waylay their rascally foreman who attempts to sell them short for wages due, where you feel every blow and fall as it happens. In short, there's little to criticise (perhaps it could have benefited from just a little injection of humour here and there to leaven the narrative) in this very masculine (women barely feature in the drama), very wonderful Hollywood classic.",

The 1948 film also starring Walter Huston and Tim Holt has remained a classic for both the noted actor and director. This is one of my favorite Bogart-had- to-play-this roles. I'm just not convinced that the film would have translated as well had it not been for Bogart playing the down-on- his-luck, then paranoid, amateur prospector.

Down-on-his-luck and disorderly American drifter Humphrey Bogart (as Fred C. Dobbs) teams up with likewise poor, but fair-minded Tim Holt (as Bob Curtin) for some part-time construction work. Cheated out of their wages, Mr. Bogart and Mr. Holt meet wizened old prospector Walter Huston (as Howard) in a flophouse and are intrigued by his stories. After Bogart buys a winning lottery ticket from pushy young Robert Blake (as a Mexican teenager), the three men head out to the Sierra Mountains and find a fortune in gold. In order to survive and make it out with their claim, the trio must survive Mexican bandits, Native South American Indians and good old-fashioned greed...",
45,20 July 2015,romanorum1,10, A Superior Study of Greed: An All-Time Classic,"The Mexican Revolution of 1910 is long over, as our story commences in Tampico, Mexico in 1925. Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart), a scruffy, unshaven American drifter, spends some of his last handout on a lottery ticket sold by a persistent Mexican boy. Meanwhile he is able to latch onto a backbreaking oil-rigging job. Dobbs teams up with Curtin (Tim Holt), another American drifter, after they get cheated out of their hard-earned wages by their shaky boss Pat McCormick (Barton MacLane). The two transients catch up with McCormick and get their money after giving the swindler a well-deserved beating. While staying in ""El Oso Negro"" flophouse Dobbs and Curtin meet up with Howard (Walter Huston), a wiry and tooth deficient old man who talks about prospecting for gold. Says Howard: ""Gold in Mexico? Why sure there is. Not ten days from here by rail and pack train there's a mountain waiting' for the right guy to come along . . ."" Howard though, grizzled but wise, warns the others that gold does make one ravenous, makes one want more and more. Dobbs says, ""It wouldn't be that way with me. I swear it wouldn't. I'd take only what I set out to get ($5,000), even if there was still a half a million dollars worth lying around waiting' to be picked up."" Right after Dobbs is told by the Mexican boy that he holds the wining lottery ticket (200 pesos). Dobbs gives the boy his ten percent cut. Stricken with gold fever, the three then pool their resources to buy provisions and mining materials; Dobbs has provided the larger share. The adventurers then head for the Sierra Madre Mountains to search for gold ore. ",

It's a beautifully looking film shot on location in Mexico, a true testament to the greatness that was Humphrey Bogart, and most of all, it's an unsettling tale of what greed can do to your soul. Out of all the characters in the movie, there are only a few that appear to have good intentions. But even those people, are fueled by greed or rage at some point or another. All of them go through fascinating journeys of either self-discovery or self-betrayal. Although it's a film that takes its time with its characters and story, there isn't a moment where I felt the film's pace needed to be picked up. That was just simply the way films were told back in the 40's. You're always in it for the long haul with these characters, even when there doesn't seem to be much left to the main character's souls.",

As Sam Spade, Bogart was a fairly ruthless ""good guy."" As Fred C. Dobbs, he's an outright bastard. Not at first, of course, but, once he's been f---ed over, he doesn't seem to have a whole lot of trouble crossing over to The Dark Side.

From the get-go, legendary director John Huston, who wrote the script and directed based on a novel by B. Traven, feeds us foreshadowing about the perils of money and seeking great fortune. In the beginning, the prospector, Howard, played by Huston's father, Walter, in a role that won him an Academy Award, warns us ""I know what gold does to men's souls.""

Writer-director John Huston, faithfully adapting B. Traven's novel, opens the film with a wry flourish, which peaks with a justified fist-fight in the local bar; the second and third acts are less satisfying, with the arc of Humphrey Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs character oddly (and improbably) turning from humble protagonist to mad-dog killer (without any preparation from the filmmaker). The melodramatic or sympathetic turns of the plot don't match up with the initial 30 minutes, which have a sarcastic or mocking tone, although the film is forceful throughout, well-produced and immensely watchable. Not a commercial success in 1948, ""Sierra Madre"" now holds a reputation as a classic, mostly due to Walter Huston's juicy, Oscar-winning supporting performance as the razor-sharp old coot. John Huston, father of Walter, also won statues for both his direction and screenplay. *** from ****",

It was worth the wait. It's an intense story of greed and human frailty, acted out by a great and tragic Humphrey Bogart and a wise, quietly magisterial Walter Huston. Bogart's descent into madness is captivating, but the Huston performance is even better.

69,24 February 2016,Maladjusted_1,10, Bogart's best - and that includes 'Casablanca'!,"'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' might be the crown jewel in the filmographies of John Huston, Humphrey Bogart and cinematographer Ted McCord, the latter being responsible for some of the sharpest, most inspired cinematography I've ever seen. (The only film from the era to challenge it, in my opinion, is Powell and Pressburger's 'Black Narcissus'.) What makes this one of my favourite films is its perfect balance of technical excellence and rich storytelling. To say too much would be to spoil the film, but I cannot help but commend the narrative style of this film. Every now and then, I see a title which promises one story and delivers something else: Hitchcock's 'Psycho', Neil Jordan's 'The Crying Game' and Spielberg's 'A.I.' are among the films most famous for narrative curveballs, but I think 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' is one of the most effective. A large part of the reason this works so well is because of the man who probably brought the film's attention to you: Humphrey Bogart. Prior to watching this film, I didn't think that the performances of the 'Casablanca' icon differed too greatly; I knew that he was an outstanding actor, but his characters could generally be described as 'romantic' and 'cynical'. My opinion changed as I watched 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre', as Bogart outstandingly portrays a character gripped by paranoia, greed and desperation, and I would confidently say that it is one of his best performances. However, my review thus far may have created the impression of this film being a one-man show; it isn't, as Walter Huston attests with his Oscar-winning supporting act. When you combine a great cast with one of Hollywood's most acclaimed directors, you probably anticipate an above-average viewing experience; if you haven't yet seen 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre', you're in for an excellent two hours.",

72,22 May 2016,sharky_55,8, I just looked at your hands and the money you gave me.,"This becomes such a stunning film with knowledge of the plot a second or even third time round. A context might give us some clues; we might expect Humphrey Bogart to be a bit more nobler, for example. Here it is interesting to be able to pick out select actions that point towards his inevitable demise and downfall. Early on he is drinking heavily and wandering aimlessly in the Mexican oil-town of Tampico, broke, depressed and drowning his sorrows. He targets stranger's patriotism as he begs for a little coin, but he doesn't give them the time of the day to even look at their face, which ends in the rather embarrassing situation of a gentleman chastising him for coming to him repeatedly. Funnily enough, though he acts sheepish and promises not to beg from him again, he is guilty of the same sort of dismissiveness, treated the boy nagging him for the lottery ticket earlier. Fredd C. Dobbs has his eye on the coin from the beginning, and throughout the film we begin to see other little signs of his outward persona cracking and his material greed taking over. ",

Like most Huston movies, a group of men are shown doing something big and their relationship unravels as a consequence of their actions. Although this is not a bank robbery heist, Huston treats it like one because our heroes lose the fortune that they have chased like a will of the wisp into the parched deserts of Mexico.

Huston teamed up with legendary Hollywood star Humphrey Bogart on six occasions, but never with more success than here, though one could certainly make a case for 'The Maltese Falcon (1941)' or 'The African Queen (1951).' The story concerns two young Americans in Mexico (Bogart and Tim Holt) who team up with wizened old gold-digger Howard (Walter Huston, the director's father) to strike it rich in the remote Sierra Madre Mountains. They do, indeed, strike it rich, but human greed leads the group to gradually turn against each other, inevitably leaving them with nothing.",
96,22 January 2014,pixrox1,10," How much ""treasure"" was there, actually?","Well, toward the end of THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, characters state several times that 10 months' of manually chiseling into solid rocks with pick axes, hammering the resulting rocks into dust, and separating gold out via running water has produced a three-man haul of gold dust worth $105,000. Earlier, the price of gold has been pegged at $20 per ounce. Doing the math, this comes out to 5,250 ounces, worth about $10 million now, adjusted for market rises and inflation. No wonder the bandits dumped all of it into the ""Norther' winds""--350 pounds is a lot of excess weight for a few half-dead but valuable burros to be carrying! Since it's also stated in the movie that the MAXIMUM yield of this gold vein was 20 ounces of gold dust per ton of ore pulverized from solid rock, this hard-working trio smashed a MINIMUM of 262 tons of rock into dust in just 300 days! That's about 600 pounds per man per day--or at least 60 pounds per man hourly, or a pound a minute when the trio's trips to the village for supplies, hunting, cooking, and bandit-shooting time is factored in. Personally, I think both Humphrey Bogart and John Huston look too scrawny to be pulverizing a pound of solid rock into dust virtually every waking minute for ten months (but that's just my opinion).",

The movie stars Hollywood legend Humphrey Bogart in one of his most famous roles as Fred C Dobbs a down and out American on the bum in Mexico. Through chance he meets up with two other characters played by Tim Holt and Walter Houston and decide between them to take their chance on prospecting for gold. Walter Houston's character warns the other two of the potential for problems within the trio once gold is found and his warning is right on the mark. They have to overcome not only problems from within but from outsiders too, such as the Mexican bandits who cause havoc where ever they go. It is during an encounter with these bandits that we get one of Hollywood's most famous movie lines. Bogart's character asks a bandit to show him a badge if he is a Federale as the bandit claims. The bandit responds, ""Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges! I don't have to show you any stinkin' badges!"" This is a great movie from Hollywood's Golden Age.",

In the beginning they are like brothers, help each-other, they work together hard, fight against the ruthless nature and Mexican bandits.

It sucked me in completely and two hours just flew in a blink of an eye. The ending is karmically perfect.

It concerns an ethical disconnect between a foresighted old man and Dobbs, an unreasonably suspicious middle-aged man, with a young man coerced into dividing solidarity. It tells this story with enthusiasm and Huston's insatiable appetite for male brotherhood, and it periodically cracks itself up, sometimes because it's amusing, other times sourly double-edged.

121,26 July 2014,jacabiya,10, One of the great,"This is undoubtedly a great artistic endeavor, a universal moral tale, to be appreciated by all people from every country, still relevant today. It is also one of my favorite films. Intelligent, extremely well directed, scripted, edited and acted, with some superb photography, plus Max Steiner's score. I rank Walter Huston's performance as one of the best ever. (I also love his Mr. Scratch in ""All That Money Can Buy""). His son John was one of the most literate, gifted directors in Hollywood during the 40's and 50's (qualities he didn't seem to keep up later). It is a testament to how efficient Huston's direction and script was that he managed to tell the whole story, with well-developed characters, fights and shoot-outs, travel to a remote place, bandits, psychology and mistrust, human nature, an unexpected intruder, visits to an Indian village, and scenes at a Mexican pueblo, in just over 2 hours. One measure of greatness for me is the innumerable times I'm able to see the film, another the many memorable scenes, shots and details, mostly dealing with Howard: Howard's explanation on the effect of gold in men, the fight at the cantina, the look of Howard when Dobbs and Curtin shake hands and agree to go prospecting for gold, the whole sequence with Howard's dancing when he finds the gold, ending with him pointing to the mountain: ""Up there!"" (one of the greatest scenes ever); the cut to Howard looking at Dobbs when he first mentions dividing the gold; the boy's revival; Howard looking back when he's forced to go back with the Mexican Indians; Dobbs turning suddenly mad by the campfire; Howard's laugh at the end. Now be advised: this is a man's film, inhabited by tough men, ambitious, flawed, sometimes dumb, who respond to reason but have no qualm to lie or kill if necessary. John Huston's oeuvre has little place for women, and this film is no exception, with no prominent female role, mostly leisure girls, except for the reference to Cody's wife, the classic ideal woman. Even when the 3 adventurers discuss what they intend to do with their money, when it comes to women they keep silent. Be also advised that this film originated a somewhat mythic view in Hollywood of the country of Mexico, as someone else wrote: ""The Mexico portrayed in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and then subsequently promulgated in later Westerns is that of a mythic space with four distinctly separate parts, which incorporate the four main stereotypes of Mexico at that time: the city, starkly divided between the corrupt wealthy and the downtrodden poor; the primitive pueblo which heralds simple justice under one person, such as a mayor; the wilderness camp in which no law exists save for guns; and the village, an Eden-like paradise.""",
122,28 March 2019,Horst_In_Translation,6, Epitome of a good gold rush western with a handful memorable characters,"""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" is an American black-and-white movie from 1948 that is over 70 years old now and was directed by John Huston when he was around the age of 40, one of his earlier, but not very early career efforts. It runs for a bit over two hours and features a handful big name actors. Most of them were probably far more known back then, even if they are still considered stars from their era today. The movie was nominated for four Oscars and won three of these for Best Direction, Best Supporting Actor and Best Screenplay, but came short for Best Picture. These were the only two wins for John Huston, even if he was nominated many more times, also almost 40 years later still. The supporting actor trophy went to Huston's father Walter really not too long before his death. But the big name here is Humphrey Bogart who plays the central character, the one in the middle of it all. A less significant character is played by the young Robert Mitchum and number 3 in the food chain is Walter Huston and he won some trophies that indicate a lead performance, just not at the Oscars and I am not too surprised he did because it's really too close to call between lead and supporting in my opinion. Up to you to decide, but yeah it is also not really necessary to categorize everything. Let's just say he was really good because that is certainly true and I also felt he was close to stealing the movie from Bogart, if he didn't even. A bit surprising Bogart himself was not nominated for any awards here.",

If anything speaks to the genuinely abiding quality of John Huston's 1948 masterpiece, not coincidentally a similar parable of the absolute corruption of greed, it is that Anderson's film, now regarded as a contemporary classic and one of the most powerful films in several decades, showed a level of devotion to the point of almost eerie reverence towards Huston's film, only hoping to in part live up to its near peerless quality and craftsmanship.

Of all the great films that have been measured and studied from the Golden Age of Hollywood in the 1940s and 1950s, this one stands out as one of the best. Humphrey Bogart stands tall in giving one of his greatest performances as the cynical, hot-tempered, and paranoid Fred C. Dobbs who goes to search for gold with Tim Holt's Curtin and Walter Huston's Howard. Huston's son, John, directs and writes the screenplay in much the same fashion as another classic of his, The Maltese Falcon. Once again, Bogart is the key character, but in this one he is much less likable. All performances aside, the story is the true strong part of this film.

None other that the subject that is one of the banes of mankind i.e. ""greed"" is explored and the viewer is invited to ask what would I do or have done if that was me? Remember, there are no wrong answers as we all do what we must to figure out what works and what doesn't sometimes realizing there is a better way and sometimes not. We wont know unless we take the risk to know. That point is made quite well when the old man in the story simply states if we don't take a risk we can't make a gain. Of course as a viewer we have no stake in the movie except an emotional one but that teaches quite well along with holding your attention from start to finish. As a story, it unfolds rather nicely introducing you to the characters and allowing each their substance. What this does is make the move memorable for its quality scenes of which there are so many resulting in a comeback experience. I have seen this movie so many times and each time I am fed well just like a thanksgiving dinner. Greed, who hasn't suffered by it or for it makes its entrance and doesn't leave until moderated and brought into control. Not the other guys greed mind you but your own. When you become sensible then you may help or comment on others. The conclusion of the movie is ultra-satisfying and leaves you with a sense of adventure well lived just for the experience alone. This is what life is all about. Kudos to all involved including of course the author of the book of which I recommend reading. What is the Treasure of the Sierra Madre?

The only character with some ethics seems to be the old prospector Howard( played by Walter Huston).

Dobbs & Bob Curtin, two downtrodden Americans living in Tampico Mexico who team up with old-time prospector Howard(played by Walter Huston) to search for gold in the Sierra Madre mountains. At first united and friendly, the curse of greed takes hold of Dobbs(despite his initial assurances that no such thing could happen!) when they do strike it rich, but he becomes suspicious and paranoid, which is made worse by the harsh elements and Mexican bandits who threaten them, leading to inevitable tragedy and death... Superbly directed and acted film portrays its remote setting well; though the plot developments aren't surprising, they are told with such skill that it doesn't matter. Contains the classic line: ""Badges? We don't need no stinking badges!""",
143,18 May 2015,Mr-Fusion,7, Nothing like a good ol' treasure hunt,"""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", aside from being a great adventure flick, makes for unsettling viewing as we see Humphrey Bogart (having made his name playing tough guys) slowly go insane with paranoia. But the whole movie is like a sick cosmic joke as the three protagonists actually end up finding gold, only to lose it again through avarice, some nasty bandits and just plain lousy luck. It feels like a comment on both the pitfalls of capitalism and the corruptibility of man. It's all well and good until riches come between you and the rest of your crew.",

151,8 April 2017,jboothmillard,7, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"From Oscar and Golden Globe winning director John Huston (The Maltese Falcon, The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen, The Man Who Would Be King), I had heard about this film before I found it in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, probably because of the leading actor, I looked forward to watching it. Basically set in 1925, in the Mexican oil-town of Tampico, two Americans, Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt), have been swindled and are down on their luck looking for work. They meet old prospector Howard (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Walter Huston, John's father) who offers to take them on gold prospecting journey to the remote Sierra Madre mountains, they are able to bankroll the finances required when Dobbs wins a small jackpot in the lottery. Reaching the hinterlands by train, and surviving a bandit attack en route, in the desert, Howard proves himself to be the toughest and most knowledgeable, he is the one to discover the gold they seek. They dig a mine and extract much gold, but greed soon sets in, Dobbs begins to lose both his sanity and trust, lusting for the entire treasure, he is also unreasonably worried one of his partners will try and kill him. James Cody (Bruce Bennett), a fourth American, appears and gets the three debating what to do with a new stranger, rather than give him a share of the gold they have found, the three agree to kill Cody. The three prepare to kill Cody, but then the bandits reappear, pretending to be federal police, there is a tense exchange regarding proof of their authority, then a gunfight ensues, during which Cody is killed, the real federal police show up and chase the bandits away. Howard leaves to help local villagers save the life of a seriously ill little boy, he recovers, but the villagers insist Howard should be honoured, but he leaves his goods with Dobbs and Curtis. The paranoia of Dobbs continues, he and Curtis constantly argue, until one night Dobbs holds Curtis at gunpoint, shoots him, leaves him for dead, and takes all three shares of the gold, however Curtis survives and crawls away. Dobbs almost dies of thirst, until he reaches a waterhole, there he is ambushed by the same bandits they encountered earlier, they kill him, but mistakenly they believe the bags of gold are nothing but sand, the scatter the gold to the winds. While Curtis is discovered by the locals and taken to Howard's village to recover, the bandits try to sell Dobbs' donkey, a child recognises the animal, and Dobbs' clothes, reporting them to the police, they are captured, forced to dig their own graves and executed. Curtin and Howard miss witnessing the bandits' execution by moments, and they learn the gold is gone, they find the empty bags and realise that the wind carried the gold away. Curtis and Howard accept the loss with calmness, before Howard laughs that it is a good joke and does a little jig, they part ways, Howard returning to the village to have a permanent home, and Curtis returns to America to find Cody's widow. Also starring Barton MacLane as Pat McCormick, Alfonso Bedoya as Gold Hat, Arturo Soto Rangel as El Presidente, Manuel Dondé as El Jefe, José Torvay as Pablo and Margarito Luna as Pancho. Bogart gives a great performance as the highly paranoid drifter, Walter Huston is also great as the gnarled old man who knows all there is to know about gold, I will be honest and say I drifted off at times, but it is a good story of treasure hunting, John Huston certainly deserved his awards for both writing and directing, and it has fantastic thundering music by Max Steiner, a most worthwhile classic western adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay by John Huston, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Picture (tied with Johnny Belinda). Humpherey Bogart number 36 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Bogart was also number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, ""Badges? We ain't got no badges! We don't need no badges! I don't have to show you any stinking badges!"" was number 36 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, the film was number 30 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 67 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number on 100 Years, 100 Greatest Movies. Very good!",
152,8 December 2002,Senator_Corleone,10, Probably Bogart's best performance in one of Huston's best,"John Huston made a lot of good films in his career-""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""Moby Dick"", ""Key Largo"", ""Beat the Devil""-but this film is one of his best, a masterpiece that stands above (along with ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""The African Queen"") not only his other work but also other movies in general. Telling the story of three men who go into the mountains of Mexico for gold and finding greed and madness instead, ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" is an brilliant character study that shows Humphrey Bogart's character, Fred C. Dobbs (one of THE famous characters in film history) turn from a ragged, homeless loser into a paranoid monster. Very grim considering the time it was made, ""Treasure"" is a very mature take (much like ""The Asphalt Jungle"") on the subject of pathetic people with hopeless, desperate dreams. Walter Huston deservedly won an oscar for his portrayal of Howard, an old coot who is revealed to be smarter and wiser than he appears. His speech about what ""gold does to men's souls"" is haunting when taken into context. Tim Holt is also strong as Bob Curtin, the young man who hooks up with Dobbs and ends up almost losing his life for it. Come to think of it, there are no slackers in this cast. But, inevitably, it is Bogart who stands above the rest, even oscar-winning Huston. His performance is on another level, watching his transformation is a mesmerizing experience. On the AFI 100 Greatest Movies special, Mel Brooks says Bogart's performance is ""beyond Oscars"". Well, apparently it is because Bogart didn't even get nominated for this film. When viewing the film you realize just how criminal this exclusion was. The layers Bogart puts on as this character go beyond simple portrayal. Bogart is nuanced in a way that when Dobbs threatens Curtin, he is simultaneously scary and tragic. There is a scene where he grabs Curtin and points a gun at his face, and as you look at Bogart's dirty, unshaven face in the intense firelight you don't see a man, you see the embodiment of mad, the personification of insanity. Huston obviously also had the ""genius"" switch on for knowing how to frame this movie, how to make the interactions between characters seem so real and original when the subject of the film is something so universal and common as greed. But the strength of Bogart is what makes this film reverberate with meaning and power. He is the engine to this vehicle, and everyone else seems to play off him. No one else can be Fred C. Dobbs. No one else can be Humphrey Bogart. 10/10",

All three of them went there with hopes to find anything that will give them some kind of life but after realizing how much they could get Dobbs starts to change attitude towards them leaving with quantity of gold they have. Dobbs slowly but surely starts to lose himself in so much gold that starts to eat him and now his mistrust is pointed into everybody. After encountering Cody, there arrives trouble with bandits and now they are face to face and trying to survive. Cody ends up dead and bandits running away from Federals and now three companions decide to leave. One night they come in touch with indios that seek help for their kid and Howard decides to help them and tomorrow they are going away but villagers are determined that Howard stays and enjoys with them leaving Dobbs and Curtin to carry his gold. Dobbs finally lost it and in his madness he shots Curtin taking all gold and hoping to leave with everything. Dobbs soon after gets caught recognized by bandits which led to his death and Curtin was found by indios so now they are leaving to find Dobbs. Their discovery shocked them but it had a great sarcastic ending. It was a great journey and adventure but sometimes movie feels to slow and to long but it had a a great point of view on humans. There were some great and intense moments alongside with a great script by John Huston. All three men Bogart (Dobbs), Holt (Curtin) and Walter Huston were great in the movie giving three different portrayals of men but original. 3.5/4",
155,6 May 2020,krational66,7, Gold on the ground,"French Chanson came from the back of my body, and I was still reminiscing about the movie ""Blood Sands"" I just saw. Humphrey Bogart's old face with wrinkles like scars is really impressive. Greed is the theme of this movie, as the kind old tramp said: ""When gold has not yet appeared, friendship still exists."" The film has a strong masculinity, first of all, there is no actress in it, and the other is that the background of the film is set in desolate Mexico. The bandits, the Dallas Cowboys who suddenly broke in, the Indians who were grateful for the illustration, and the bloodshed that was later caused by greed. A few unkempt men collapsed rationally in front of the heavy sands, their eyes reflected in the shining color, the inner balance tilted inadvertently, the evil thoughts of people rose like a pirate flag waving in the wind. The role that Bao Jia appeared in ended up killing others, and the fleeing robber ended his life with a knife. The remaining two guys also lost their gold in the sandstorm, but they laughed, from the dust, In the end it returned to the dust, very simple truth, they finally woke up in a moment of total loss. People are entangled with desire all day long. It is simply a virtue, but if you stand on the square of the whole world and cry out loud, I am afraid that few people will take care of you.",
156,30 March 2014,jrl0726,10, It's The All-Time Number One,"There are many reasons why this masterwork of art is the greatest film ever made but there are two major ones. First, it is the best combination of creative expression and realism ever put on film. Second it touches on more genres (adventure, character study, drama, murder, psychology, cultures and social values) than any other film. All these genres are wrapped around the central theme of GREED. The other reasons are, of course, named Huston, Bogart, Huston and Traven. The great John Huston outdid himself with both his screenplay and direction in this film which he took many years to undertake and finish. His incomparable scene making is displayed in monumental glory here. Huston insisted on much of the film being made on location in Mexico (extremely rare in Hollywood at the time) and WB was in the end despite the cost, thrilled when they saw the outcome. Huston's dad, Walter was nothing short of sensational in this, his career performance. Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs was perhaps only topped by Capt. Queeg among his many singularly memorable fictional film characters. Huston as the supreme screen writer he was, worked with the book's mysterious author B. Traven and stayed close to the book's story. This film was nothing like Hollywood had ever produced up to that time and was more like an ""arty-Euro"" film. There were two injustices inflicted on the appreciation side of this amazing film experience. Neither Bogart or Bedoya were even nominated by the academy for their riveting and unique performances. Needless to say, this is the number one ""must see"" in American film.",

Chosen to convey that message is Bogart, in what must be his least endearing role. The narrative records his progressive corruption and personality deterioration in some detail. I'd forgotten his sorry end, but, like everyone else, I'd remembered that the bandits didn't have any stinking badges. I'd remembered that Huston ended up as a witchdoctor, and also that the third prospector went off to console Cody's widow.

166,3 July 2014,firstrowboat,10, Classic Adventure,Humphrey Bogart is the master of all genres. He shows a character's strengths and faults so realistically you forget you're watching a movie. In this film his fortunes go from down to up to the ultimate demise. The suspicions of his character Dobbs are almost too disturbing to bear. Good versus evil is evident and shocking. Still Dobbs is human and the viewer can identify with him. The other prospectors are portrayed as almost saintly. The bad guys are shown as savages who don't even appreciate the importance of a lawman's badge. The ending where the good guys end up with nothing for all the trouble they went through is a letdown.

169,1 November 2019,delp-01757,9, Movie,"The film ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" depicts how gold made many men go crazy during the gold rush years and even after when gold had still not been found in some places. People would kill each other over it even if they were close friends or family, it was pure greed. The historical element that stands out the most in this film is that of the cultural values of the Mexicans. The Mexican villages were thought of as a low-class population but had a good set of laws and workers. If someone were to do them a favor or help them in a great way like the old man curtin when he revived the unconscious child, he was forced to go to their village and be treated like a king for a week. There was an aspect of good vs evil like the bandits were evil and the townspeople were good and executed the bandits for their crimes, like cops and robbers but with harsher punishments. Some viewers could interpret the gold as evil and the men as good, to show they were corrupted by it, or the opposite, men are evil and gold is only something that makes the evil come out of men. The artistic elements of cinematography were amazing in this film. Certain camera angles were in a position that allowed the viewer to see close-ups of the actors faces so that they could read their emotions based on facial expression. Even without the character talking, just by the look on their face you could tell what they are thinking or feeling. It adds a great way of self-interpreting of the story and what you think the character is about to do. The other camera angle that stood out to me was the landscape shots in which the camera was placed somewhere high and far so that it could show the scene from a great distance. This allowed the viewers to see upcoming events and an overall picture of what the characters surrounding was like.",
170,20 November 2013,dwpollar,7, Well played drama about a couple of down-and-out American's...,"1st watched 11/17/2013 -- 7 out of 10 (Dir-John Huston): Well played drama about a couple of down-and-out American's in Mexico who come upon an older prospector to help them find Gold in the Sierra mountains. Humphrey Bogart plays the more emotionally unstable of the two, and Walter Huston plays the older experienced slightly crazy gold seeker. The theme of the movie is pronounced by Huston's character early on where he says that gold changes men. Bogart's character insists this is foolish talk, but gradually degrades from a man who just wants life to turn around for him -- to a man obsessed with getting as much as he can once they find their gold. Tim Holt plays the third man in the group and fights to keep his conscience clear despite all the temptations. This ensemble piece keeps you interested as you watch the characters react and change as they mine more of the gold dust. It is also an educational movie, because the process of mining is taught by Huston's character to his two younger students in different parts of the movie. The pluses of this movie are the story by the Director John Huston, the characters, the actors, and the simple pacing without a lot of extra un-needed fluff. Today's moviegoers might have a problem with the lack of booming special effects and fast paced action but it isn't needed for this movie. Bogart, in my opinion, was deserved at least an Oscar nomination for this portrayal -- as his feelings are so evident by his facial expressions. Bogart's rough outward appearance and his ability to portray emotions so effortlessly along with his everyday-man appeal made him a famous actor -- but this was not a popular character and he pulls it off perfectly. This is a very well done drama by a much heralded director and it doesn't disappoint and shouldn't age because of how real it comes across.",

The rickety wooden towns in Mexico and the dusty outback show the desperation of the Americans who barely survive. The three characters seem true to life - one spirited, one aggressive and one passive, all becoming unhinged as time goes on. The laborious quest of digging up gold and surviving in the desert is shown in such excruciating detail that the mental fatigue becomes totally understandable. The tense standoffs with the newcomer and bandits add extra complications to the plan, making us wonder if the desperate gold miners have any chance of success and whether they were fatally flawed from the beginning.",

""Magnifecent seven"", ""Dirty dozen"" and ""Where eagles dare"" are still as kick-ass-stuff as ""Raiders of the lost ark"" to me, but Wayne's ""Searchers"" and ""Rio Bravo"", and Bogart's ""Maltese falcon"" just feel boring and outdated. Even Kurosawa has been so much re-used that it pales in comparison to, say, ""Lone wolf and the cub"" to me. So I really didn't have high hopes for ""Sierra madre"". I thought it'd offer some lame action, lines and situations quoted to death, misplaced Chaplin-gags and not much more. However, I was wrong. From the get-go it just took a grip at me and didn't let go until the end. Action is scarce, but the stuff in-between is STRONG. Dialogue, characters and situations make sense and advance the plot in beautiful balance, and a whole lot of stuff happens in Spanish without subtitles so that you STILL follow the plot so that it makes ""Die hard"" with its 'bits in German' pale in comparison.

182,23 December 1999,jmcody,10, An American Work Of Art!,"John Huston created an absolute American work of art with this film, a pessimistic, cynical and yet oddly uplifting exploration  of human behavior. This film stands with the finest works of Steinbeck and Hemingway, the paintings of Thomas Hart Benton and Georgia O'Keefe just to name a few as some of the finest work American artists have offered the world. Based on B. Traven's marxist tome, the film centers around three prospectors encountering greed, betrayal and death while prospecting for gold in the Mexican mountains. I usually despise cynical films for they usually insult and assault the viewer, this instead enlightens and entertains in the truest Aristolitilian sense(bad spelling I know!). The photography, performances (Bogie's finest hour amoung many other fine hours), writing, staging and editing all add up to a most memorable event. I enjoy this film even more than Citizen Kane. I don't know if it is better, but it is certainly as good. Only drawback, a perfectly awful musical score. I also reccomend watching this in a double feature with Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch.

It is just (excruciatingly) long, full of unnecessary scenes and dialog, filled with a majestic score that doesn't do the film justice and some scenes that are somewhat painful to watch. It's not that I do not like films from the 1940's (heck I saw The Maltese Falcon last week and gave that one a 7 out of 10), but that this film has written old-time Hollywood production written all over it.

Bogart was always trying to get easy money with the lottery and thinks of finding gold. They go up onto the hills and it is a slow going. The story is really rather slow and it seems that it is really that nobody gets anything free and more that there is a problem because that they do not trust each other and then especially Bogart is going mad and maybe wants it all.

Also the film felt too long with a sad ending, making it unlikely that I will rewatch this one. The characters were mostly unlikeable and too loquacious, the incessant talking in lieu of doing got tiresome. I guess you can call this film a cautionary tale on the weaknesses inherent to human nature and how money and greed can get the better of people under the right circumstances.

Anderson has gone on record to say that he sat down with it every night before he started filming and the influences are all too clear; desperate penniless men scrabbling among dust and rock for a fortune, only to lose their souls when they find it. This isn't the only area that 'Treasure' has seeped into the public consciousness though; that old Texan billionaire that occasionally turns up on The Simpsons? That's Walter Huston's prospector all over. Every person that's turned up at a fancy dress party wearing a Pancho, sombrero and plastic bullet belt while speaking in a ridiculous Mexican accent? They'd be dressed as regular cowboys if it wasn't for Alfonso Bedoya's villainous bandito. The character on the front of Golden Nugget's cereal boxes? That's...well, I'm sure you get the picture by now. 'Treasure' is no mere catalogue for pop-culture aficionados though, it's powerful stuff.

The lettering in the book is done with deliberate care as would all the work in the town, or village, be done in contrast with the rootless expedience of the prospectors and the still more desperate rapacity of the bandits.

220,29 October 2020,gab-14712,9," A Powerful, Cautionary Tale About Greed!","John Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a beautiful, engaging feature which describes, in great detail, how greed can destroy and ravage a human soul. This is a film which has been replicated many times but never to the degree in which this film is, This classic was written and directed by John Huston, the main behind The Maltese Falcon and The African Queen and Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt, and Huston's own father, Walter Huston were the stars with the senior Huston winning an Oscar for his performance. This film is beautiful to look at with its gorgeous cinematography. The story itself paid off thanks to Huston's meticulous research and his characters were three-dimensional. Huston generally worked at his best when bromances were created...or destroyed. We clearly see how gold can negatively affect a person's life. How it can make a person paranoid to the highest degree, where he could trust absolutely no one. Where it could leave to a devastating final outcome.
Huston became aware of the film's source material in the mid-1930's, which was authored by B.Traven. Huston wanted to option the movie but World War II intervened. He created several documentaries about the warfront. After the war and the raging success of his debut The Maltese Falcon, he had the clout to make whatever he wanted, and this is what he chose. He understood the source material well enough to create characters with such depth to them. When Humphrey Bogart learned about the film, he lobbied Huston to play the lead role. He once famously told a film critic that is next role would be someone who is not too nice, but with a curse word added. There are many stories about the film's production. It is one of the first movies to be shot on location in Tampico, Mexico. The film's budget ballooned to over three million dollars and Jack L. Warner called the cast and crew home. Warner thought he would be getting a B-western and the initial box office was not great. Eventually, success did find Warner when this film became the instant classic.
Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and Curtin (Tim Holt) are American prospectors down on their luck in Mexico. They meet a contractor who promises to pay them for remote work. Once the job is finished, the contractor scrams without paying the men. Meanwhile, the two men overhear an older prospector, Howard (Walter Huston) saying there is still gold in the mountains. Once the Americans beat the money out of the prospector, they have the money to pay for their trip to the mountains and they recruit the wise prospector. Once they find gold, that is when it really begins. On their journey, they encounter bandits, Indians, and Federales. While those encounters may seem intense, the most intense encounter will be within themselves. Will the power of greed undermine the men's goals to find wealth?
The performances are excellent. Humphrey Bogart played someone who wasn't even a good guy to begin with. Then we watch how greed slowly, but surely overtakes him. This sort of role is different from previous roles. Certainly different from Casablanca. Still, all of his performances are full of depth and insightful and this one is no different. As for Walter Huston, he originally resisted this part. He felt like he is still a leading man and was skeptical of any supporting roles, but he was eventually won over...and gave the film's best performance! Sorry, Humphrey. He seems like a bit of an oddball at first, but he really is a wise, calculating old man who seems to be knowledgeable in just about anything.
Overall, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is an excellent character film set within an adventure mind. It really is not a movie about treasure, but about how greed can easily overcome a man's mental mindset. This film was a major influence on future television shows and movies. Breaking Bad, my favorite television show, received major influence from this film. Huston did his research in making his script as tight as possible. Fun trivia fact! Bogart starred in two films where major lines are often misquoted; Casablanca and now this film where we meet the bandits masquerading as Federales for the very first time. In addition to the script, excellent direction and performances, this film is beautiful to look at and has a wonderful score from Max Steiner. Oh, one more piece of trivia! This is the first film to have a father/son duo win at the Oscars! Anyhow, check this film out. It does not get much better than this.

245,7 December 2020,jayjaycee,9, Versatile and intense genre mix as precious as gold,"""The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre"" is 1948 adventure western directed by John Huston starring Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston.
⚪
All in all, the third collaboration between Bogart and Huston mines for gold as intensively as it digs in the hearts of men, because even if it is an adventurous tale on the surface, it is furthermore a powerful examination of humans influenced by wealth and fortune, an intense journey of mistrust, paranoia and greed, defined by the excellent performances of its leading trio, eclectic writing and a packing atmosphere, and thus it becomes an ambiguous western that stands out from other titles of the genre.
⚪
#ItsAHumphreyBogartChristmas continues with yet another collaboration of the legend and iconic filmmaker John Huston. Since the film for my milestone has been nothing short of a disaster, I knew that this late-forties film would make up for the pain I have gone through the day before, and as I expected it no differently, it was indeed a cinematic remedy. Seven years after their initial team-up ""The Maltese Falcon"", Bogie and Huston this time left the film-noir behind and ventured into a whole different direction, but the brilliance the both are able to create doesn't suffer from that genre shift. What kind of film is this, though? Well, at first appearance, it seems to be an adventure film, but already after twenty minutes it is palpable that Huston didn't want to abide in the boundaries of just one genre and, as crazy as it sounds, experimented with other stylistic directions as well. Yes, basically it the story of three men seeking fortune and mining for gold, but it digs deeper than that and almost effortlessly becomes a genre-fluid film that fluctuates between being a western, a gangster movie and even a (psychological) thriller. How that is possible? Well, if you are John Huston and know how humans work, you can create such a crazy genre-mix easily. Unlike his directorial debut, this Huston film locates its story in the desolate and dangerous desert of Mexico, and Bogie, who I have previously only seen as a suave and clean-cut smoothie, plays the dirty, unshaved and sneaky Fred C. Dobbs, an unemployed American drifter in search of work in the South. After he attains money and befriends two other workers, the trio starts for the wasteland in order to mine for gold. However, when the three hit the mother lode and are aware of their fortune, mistrustfulness, greed and paranoia come into the play, and as you can guess, it all goes down from there. What surprises me the most about this film is Humphrey Bogart, at that time most famous as the star of ""Casablanca"" and ""To Have And Have Not"", because in this one he plays an entirely different kind of character, and it was unfamiliar to see him like that. As mentioned above, I have only seen him with suit and hat, portraying suave, clever and cool gentlemen who are two steps ahead of their enemies, and despite some minor tendencies, always end up being the good guy. In this one? Well, it was nothing short of shocking to look at him, portraying a dishevelled and anything but elegant vagrant. Furthermore, surprising was how he even gradually turned into mischievous, paranoid and insidious madman driven by contentiousness. Speaking of which, this is also one of the finest and most intriguing aspects of the entire film. Almost in the blink of an eye, the light-hearted adventure film turns into a hideous series of uncompromising mind games, as well as an insightful anthropological study, as it graphically depicts the moral deterioration of honest men tainted by greed and wealth. Seriously, it was unexpected but nevertheless magnificent to see Bogart playing the bad guy for once, but even if his performance is excellent as per usual, I couldn't help but realizing that the legendary Humphrey Bogart is unexpectedly put in shade by one of his co-stars. Walter Huston, the father of the director and acclaimed actor himself, portrays the old man Howard, the most experienced prospector, and plays him with such an incredible authenticity and charisma (and even speaks Spanish like a native). Seriously, this time around it was someone starring opposite Bogie who was the character seemingly being two steps ahead of the others, and honestly, he was the only one I have ever seen stealing Bogart the show. The ""Casablanca"" superstar famously said, ""One Huston is bad enough, but two are murder"", referring to the depth of Walter Huston's performance, and I think that says it all. Deservedly, he won the Oscar as best supporting actor afterwards. Aside from the outstanding acting power of this film, it furthermore displays an eclectic and wonderfully written script that superbly harmonizes with the actors' capabilities, as well as the setting. From uninvited guest, over problems with bandits to altercations with each other, it offers everything and never becomes boring, quite the contrary, it ups the ante every single time. As Howard correctly states, if gold is at stake, people change completely, and this film mercilessly illuminates this phenomenon in all its gritty layers. In the final act, Bogie's character must pay the price for his greed and is eventually killed by bandits (something I never thought it would see in a movie from the forties!) and the gold they have prospected for month is gone forever. Eventually, nobody wins and the only thing the two survivors have learnt from the entire trip was that there are more important things in life than fortune, such as following one's dreams and desires. The true treasure is this insight, and I think it couldn't have ended better than this. However, if there is one minor flaw about this film, it must be how the film sometimes shifts tonally and goes from intense to cheerful in the matter of minutes and vice versa. Like, two of the protagonists have played a mind game of life and death, and one has seemingly killed the other brutally, and then it cuts to the third being spoiled by indigenous people. It is a matter of consistency that bothered me there, but its criticizing at the highest stage. In the end, it is another stroke of genius by Bogart and Huston, and a proof that they can also do something else besides film noir. It almost effortlessly took an old genre and turned it into a versatile mix that is as original as it is outstanding, and it is comprehensible how it inspired many projects that have become legendary today, namely ""Indiana Jones"", ""There Will Be Blood"" and even ""Breaking Bad"". If it wasn't for this classic, many great films wouldn't have been as we know them today. No pun intended, but this film is indeed pure gold.",

248,6 February 2001,austex23,9, A masterpiece.,"A film good in so many ways, one hardly knows where to start.  When this film was made, Hollywood studios competed to see who could do the worst job of adapting good books to the screen, often ripping the vitals out of the books they adapted, removing every trace of realism and intelligence from them.  Huston made Traven's book with style and faith to the author's sense of irony beyond tragedy.   With incredible performances and that wonderful visual style that characterizes all Huston's films, Sierra Madre only falls short for me in a couple of places.  As much as I love Max Steiner's scores, I'm not sure he was the best choice for this film, and the occasional taint of Hollywood schmaltz creeps into the script, but for the most part the movie transcends its era.  A metaphor for every endeavor men (and women) undertake together, a study in the way things fall apart around the imperfect center of human souls, and a great adventure, Sierra Madre is a narrative masterpiece.",
249,29 December 2019,rodinnyc,10, Perfect film making,"I continue to be intrigued by the perfection of this film. For story telling, this film is superb. Every aspect of it goes to build the characters and the plot. There are so many expertly played scenes...some of them seemingly less important. Child actor Robert Blake is great as the child begging Bogart's Dobbs to buy a lotto ticket.
The meeting between Holt's Curtin and Dobbs. The meeting between Walter Huston and Bogart. And the film continues to unfold expertly in John Huston's cinematic eye. I hadn't seen the film for many years and just rewatched it on DVD. So many of the details of the film, I'd forgotten. Everything that happens builds to Bogart's psychotic, suspicious breakdown where he is sure that all are plotting against him.
Tim Holt deserves more recognition for his contribution to the power of this film.
At the start he seems a callow personality but as the film progresses he grows in stature as man of strength and honesty. Walter Huston's saving of the young Indian child may seem like an unnecessary diversion to some but I found it fascinating and just adds to our understanding of the character's wisdom. And of course that ending has that twist of fate that seems inevitable as we watch it, but the first time I recall I was astonished. It's an ensemble film in which the actors really play their roles in synch with one another. Let me also add a word for Bruce Bennett's Cody,the interloper, the intruder for whom they felt the need to dispose of. His character was so articulate that I thought is this reasonable to expect in these circumstances? But then the dialog throughout the film is heightened at times and at others has the rich, power of how folks actually speak. I enjoy this film throughly and it gives me a lot to ponder about the circumstances of these mens' lives and the struggle to achieve a better life...certainly a more comfortable life as Bogart's character expounds. I think it's Bogart's most nuanced and complex performance...although I note in one scene at the beginning he gives this the kind of facial tick that became a part of anyone doing an imitation. All in al great acting combined with superb dialog, story telling and directing.",

The Treasure of Sierra Madre follows a couple down on their luck Americans, one played by Humphrey Bogart in a career best performance, in Mexico who team up with an old prospector played by Walter Huston to search the Sierra Madres for gold. When their exploration strikes a good find, the men start to change. Despite the setup, this isn't a fun adventure film. It's an expertly written and executed morality tale that illustrates the nature of greed; how easily it can change a man and what he's willing to do to keep it. Once they strike gold, each successive scene cranks up the stakes and tension a level with the moral situation getting dire when a stranger shows up to their camp, when bandits arrive, when local Indians approach them, and finally when they have to get the gold back to civilization.

This is a superbly made adventure drama, and a highly critical piece of commentary on society, and more specifically capitalistic societies. Within the three main characters Huston and writer B. Traven show how wealth and the desire for wealth corrupt men's souls and ultimately corrupt entire societies. In their blind lust and greed for wealth (or gold in the case of the movie) the plights of others are ignored, courtesy is exchanged for shrewdness and politeness is exchanged for malice. Even foreigners who happen along and want to share in the excess of wealth are ostracized and driven off, to the point of murder if they insist on sticking around. It is obvious that the writers had an agenda, if not to just create an amazingly entertaining film then to point out the ills of a society that is preoccupied with it's pursuit of wealth and it's misguided ideas of privilege.

273,30 October 2020,ptone-93207,10," John Huston's masterpiece, and an essential film in the American canon",I probably don't anything to add regarding the direction and acting in this film; it is superb. The photography is adequate and does not get in the way of the focus: storytelling in a moral vein. Huston's pacing of the action is also top notch.,
274,8 June 2001,cswoodard,3, Zzzzzz,"Here's a movie that spectacularly fails the test of time. This movie is so boring, so packed with cliches and predictable scenes, that I'd rather have watched Wheel of Fortune re-runs for two hours. Oh, gee, might that be fool's gold?!",

276,14 December 2000,clive-38,10, Bogart gives another outstanding performance in this hard hitting John Huston drama,"Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) are two Americans down on their luck in Tampico, Mexico who manage to acquire a temporary job working for Pat McCormick (Barton MacLane) but don't get paid for their efforts as McCormick does a disappearing act with the money. Dobbs and Curtin catch up with him later in a bar and after coming to blows manage to get the money that was owed to them. A young Mexican boy (Robert Blake) approaches Dobbs who reluctantly buys a lottery ticket from him. Dobbs and Curtin spend the night in a flop house where they meet Howard (Walter Huston) a grizzled old timer who tells them stories of the times he went prospecting for gold in the mountains. They are both quite interested in this but don't have the necessary funds to purchase the equipment they would need. Next day the young Mexican boy comes to find Dobbs to tell him that his ticket has won some money in the lottery. It is not a fortune so he decides to invest his winnings in some tools and equipment so that Curtin and himself can team up with Howard to search for gold in the Sierra Madre mountains. Greed and distrust inevitably take hold of Dobbs and he gets increasingly suspicious of his two companions and becomes more and more paranoid as the days go by. A group of bandits led by Gold Hat (Alfonso Bedoya) come across their camp and try to rob them of the gold but with the help of James Cody (Bruce Bennett) they manage to fight them off.",
277,16 September 2009,metalrules31,9, Discover the Treasure of Sierra Madre,"I can't recall exactly where on on which movie I had heard a reference about The Treasure of Sierra Madre, which I thought had spoiled the movie for me. That was months ago, when I was back home in Honduras, now I'm a year in Finland and I'm enjoying the selection of movies at the local library. And the best? Rent's all for free!",
278,3 July 2006,dmacnab,10, One of the very best movies ever made.,"The very best handful of movies have the ability to involve you in their world. They are so real and so alive that for several hours you are totally present, real, and alive too. You react to what is happening on the screen as if it is happening in your life. You can get angry, fearful, and happy as part of the process of viewing the movie; and the outside world is temporarily absent from your consciousness. ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" is one such movie. The movie captures your all-out attention by the use of compelling images, and brilliant dialog, delivered by fabulous actors, all coordinated by a one-of-a-kind director. Few movies are so compelling so as to involve the viewer (the viewer still has to let it happen) like this one, but several others are ""Shane"", ""Taxi Driver"", and several other Bogart movies. Bottom line is: ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" is a true masterpiece that relies on a great adventure story, masterfully acted and directed, to immensely entertain from the first minute on, and to interestingly portray a valid side of the human psyche.",
279,24 February 2001,tlc75372,10, Walter Huston - The finest film performance of all time,Walter Huston gives the greatest acting performance I have every seen on film. They don't make em like that anymore. Wow! 99% of today's Hollywood actors are amatuers compared to Walter Huston. His performance alone gives this a 10 rating!,
280,16 April 2021,ioann_8ro,9, Simple but compelling,Sometimes there's no need for many words to impress.,
281,20 March 2020,gromsall-1,10, Done....as if by Order,"Only 3 Oscaars ? This is a flawless film. This may be Bogart's finest
performance Perfect casting. Walter Huston was born for his role as
Howard. Gotta love Alfonso Bedoya for not wearing "" any stinkin badges"".
He and his buddy Jose Torvay were also in a good movie a year later in
""Border Incident"".
The last movie I've seen that has this level of brilliant writing, acting,
dialogue and direction was Pul[p Fiction.",
282,19 July 2006,bobbaxter,10, The Real Treasure,"Literature has three basic plots: man against man, man against nature and man against himself. THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE features elements of all three plots. Its central character is driven insane by greed (man vs. himself). The treasure hunters face bandits (man vs. man). The journey is a constant struggle against the elements (man vs. nature). The film's characters are constantly struggling against insurmountable odds.",
283,8 April 2006,ehalyama1,10, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"Being a psychiatrist and having viewed this movie many many times I can perhaps say something of interest. First where was Ann Sheridan in the movie? Big mystery for me, finally I found out that she was the prostitute that passed Bogie and went up the stairs just before John Huston appeared to be dunned for some money. Finally I found her. The one thing that always bothered me was the fireside scene. Curtin being aware that Dobbs was dangerous supposedly just sat there watching Dobbs until he had to fall asleep. Why didn't he just tie him up? An annoying logical lapse in the movie. Then Dobbs supposedly shot Curtin in the back and then after he fell shot him again, according to Curtin. But if you listen to the shots they were fired very quickly so here was a mistake. The shots should have had a space of time between them, they didn't. Here are the insights caught by a man watching this movie so many times. A fine movie for all time. Among the ten best ever made. And don't forget, Robert Blake stole the cup Bogie was drinking from when he had the scene with the lottery ticket. I guess you could say speaking as a psychiatrist that Blake showed his larcenous and later suspected murderous character when he took the cup.",
284,9 October 2019,etstiffler,6, I'm glad I watched the whole way through,"This had a big potential for me to be highly rated, but Dobbs was the key character that made me change my mind. The character was bi-polar. He wasn't playing a conflicted friend/enemy. He was playing two completely separate characters. Personally, I love when good guys die at the end. I wish all three would have killed each other or been murdered by bandits.",
285,2 April 2023,nikolaknezev,1, Fioke gold,"Ironically the fool's gold is a sentence from this movie but it actually truly represents the reality of it. Only a fool could give this more than 5 or 6, let alone 10, in any century ! One reviewer has said that it's outdated, but even for it's era, it's cheep production, cheep acting and cheep writing; nothing holds up to it's rating . The old chap would have been almost ok, hadn't be for its fast talking, that no one could really follow in full. He talks like a snake rattles and as cowboys dancing guitar. Obvious, uninteresting; had I known that Bogart will play a villain, I'd never would be up to this. But here I am, spending even more time on reviewing, just to give warning to people who respect the actor so they could avoid spoiling his memory. The only good thing was that I couldn't catch, but once, his lisp.",
286,4 May 2022,tez-83975,10," KARMA is the theme with ""Treasure""","""Treasure"" is one of the GREATEST movies ever made,cast wise,acting,photography,script,sound,overall directing and editing. Evey step of the way,it's KARMA coming back to someone,be it good or bad karma,it's there for just about every character,even up to the last frame,where we see the last bag of gold dust,tied up and just waiting for it to be picked up by someone. Perhaps that ""Someone"" deserves good Karma or not?",
287,28 May 2014,filipeoctave,3," Take it for what it is... (This and many other ""acclaimed"" films here).","I'm a fan of John Huston, a very accomplished and conscientius writer and director. BUT this is just a simple adventure tale, there's nothing deep about about it or should be found. It's straightforward, predictable, got old cliché morals, it's the more suitable for the kids. It's well crafted alright, but for what it is. And there are adventures, with juvenile tones or not, better, certainly. For people to say it's a summit of the art of the cinema in any aspect is not something i'll say i can't get through my head, fact is these people are talking nonsense, or more likely, don't have a presentable cinematic repertoire. (And what else can you suppose of a majority who elected The Shawshank Redemption as the best film of all time for this site's survey?)",
