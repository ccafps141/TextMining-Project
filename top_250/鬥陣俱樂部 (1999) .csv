2,14 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, Fincher's tour de force is a bruising assault on the senses,"David Fincher's dark, brooding assault on the senses employs much of the same style as he used in SEVEN, to great effect. This is a complex, intelligent film which, for a change, doesn't take the viewer for granted. A big streak of black comedy runs through the centre, making things a bit easier to cope with, but it's still a morose, disturbing film, a good film, yes, but not one which makes you feel good after watching it.",e
3,16 December 2013,gogoschka-1,10, Welcome to movie heaven!,"Let's ignore the advice and talk about ""Fight Club"". This film was a milestone; although it bombed at the box office, Fincher's cinematic language left a mark that can still be felt now, 14 years later, on many current releases. Despite the risky 'cutting edge' nature of the film, Fincher got a huge budget for this and it shows: the camera effects and the whole production design are amazing.",v
4,18 May 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9," You love it or you hate it, personally I loved it","Perhaps a little too long, but Fight Club is just a very well-made, brilliantly written and superlatively performed film. Essentially a satirical fable, it tells of an insomniac loser teaming up with a seditious soap salesman to form a no-holds-barred-fight club as an outlet for their direction-less aggression. This concept is an intriguing and original one, and works really well. Then there is the script, it is absolutely superb, with dialogue that will make you both laugh and think. Fight Club is very well made, with elaborate production design, great editing and startling images. David Fincher's direction is brilliantly handled and the performances of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are superb. Overall, just a great film, a mesmerising ride through the 1990s male psyche. 9/10 Bethany Cox",i

6,17 November 2019,ArthvrPendrag0n,8, We should actually talk about the Fight Club,"Fight Club is one of those movies that hits the spot without missing an inch of it. The nameless narrator (Edward Norton) is an insomniac office worker who lives a materialistic life. From the very beginning the movie comments on the capitalist nature of society by portraying how consumerism moves the world, but is unable to give relief in the end. Flipping through catalogues of new furniture for his apartment is the narrator's only personality trait. To fight against his insomnia he starts attending to support groups. By lying to people, pretending he has conditions he does not have, the narrator finds relief - the emotional acceptance he finds in the support groups is enough to allow him to sleep at night. The emotional complexity of the character is nothing unrealistic. David Fincher makes a subtle, yet clear, comment on the nature of materialist societies where no one really listens to each other nor care about each other. The system doesn't care about anyone, the distance between people - especially enhanced by how they function in the capitalist world - is a major plot point. However, when the narrator is finds someone who's a faker just like him he loses his emotional escape - "" Her lie reflected my lie. Suddenly, I felt nothing. I couldn't cry, so once again I couldn't sleep"".",w
7,22 October 2019,MrPupkin,10, An unpredictable movie.,"Everything about Fight Club is simply amazing. The acting, the directing, and the story is simply superb. However, going into this film I had already had had some of the major twists spoiled for me, and this is a movie that relies so heavily on those twists that knowing them will detract from the experience significantly. Because of that, the film is really only worth seeing of you have no prior knowledge of it whatsoever.",/
8,3 October 2019,johnnysilverhand-13047,10, HOW THIS IS NOT EVERYONE'S FAVORITE MOVIE IS BESIDE ME,"I first saw Fight Club when I was 8 years old. I didn't understand any of it, but I liked the fighting and editing.",r
9,3 January 2007,Hitchcoc,9, It's Hard to Take Your Eyes Away,"I'm not much into graphic violence. This film transcends that. It has wonderful direction, and, even though it is brutal, it takes things to another ledge. Edward Norton is really controlled as he realizes his power. It's too easy to throw in spoilers so I will leave things to the viewer. The search for self and the growing cult around Fight Club made me suspicious. Still, to watch what happens to the two men at the center and what they are without Fight Club is the core. One of the neat things about this film is seeing it a second town makes it even better. The mental byplay between Pitt and Norton increases tension to explosiveness. If you want to see what can happen to a story when put in masterful hands, read the book (which is outstanding), and see the movie. They show that art forms can treat the same material, each in their own ways.",w
10,10 July 2021,angryleprechaun,10, Go in completely blind,"The movie is phenomenal. I liked every single actor, the story was great and had some plot twists. It kept me engaged thoroughly and I was never bored. I only watched it for first time in my life a month ago, and I suggest you to do the same if you haven't!",2

13,10 May 2000,dr. gonzo,10, a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.,"""Fight Club"" an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the ""Choose life,"" anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of ""Trainspotting,"" and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds it. The film's narrator (Edward Norton) is an insignificant cog in the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his job and what he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave to his IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as many self-help/dealing with terminal diseases sessions as he can. It provides him with an escape from his sleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters his life and upsets his routine. The narrator also meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman whose straightforward honesty, candor and sleazy lounge-lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air. One night, after the two men have bonded over beers, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. At first, it seems like an absurd request but after they pound on each other for a bit, a strange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of release and satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In a world where people are desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and pretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground sensation. However, it becomes readily apparent that Tyler has more elaborate plans than just organizing brawls at the local bar. David Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of ""Seven"" and married it with the clever plot twists and turns of ""The Game"" and assembled his strongest effort to date. ""Fight Club"" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message -- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes ""Fight Club"" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works. Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening. This is the way films should be made. Why must we always have to go through the A+B+C formula? ""Fight Club"" openly rejects this tired, clearly outdated structure in favour of a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze frames, slow motion and every other film technique in the book that only reinforces its anarchistic message. A film like this would have never been greenlighted by a major studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to the project. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that he was the only choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with ""Kalifornia"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"", Pitt grunges himself down and disappears completely into his role to a frighteningly convincing degree. During many of the brutal fight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy mess that'll surely have the ""Legends of the Fall"" fans running for the exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably his best -- for the simple fact that he becomes the character so completely. If Pitt has the flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his perfect foil as the seemingly meek yet sardonic narrator. It's a deceptively understated performance as the last third of the film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearly our surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and his wry observations on our consumer-obsessed culture are right on the money. They are the perfect setup for Tyler's introduction and his view on the world which is clearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the notion that we are what we own. And ultimately, that is what ""Fight Club"" tries to do. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, ""win."" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that makes ""Fight Club"" a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.",5
14,26 August 2020,Ruskington,7, The first rule of Fight Club: You never talk about how over-hyped Fight Club is,"I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.",7
15,15 October 1999,buk-3,10, A unique film,"Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been ""asked"" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.",1

17,26 December 2021,richardjohndecker,9, Not about fighting,"Fight club is not at all what I expected, but I was surprisingly ecstatic about what the movie was. A terrifically made thriller that builds suspence and keeps you invested throughout the entirety of the film. Be warned the film is incredible through the first watch and provides a different perspective the second time.",/
18,7 June 2019,tierneys-95725,10, I study philosophy but this film took me for a ride,"I watched the first hour and a half of this movie when I was 16 before I asked my boyfriend to turn it off because it was too dark. Now I am in my early 20s and I watched it until the very end, credits and all, and it truly is the best thing I've ever watched. I'm obsessed and I cant wait to watch it again. I reckon it will hit me even harder when I am older and I'm sure it will be just as fantastic.",?

22,25 June 2000,Dante Hicks,10, It doesn't get much better than this,"Similar in idea to 'American Beauty' but certainly not in style or content this bleak look at underground culture and the spiritual redemption it brings is easily one of the most intelligent films I've ever seen. Directed by the same man who brought us the superb 'The Game' this is another film which you'll have to see more than once to truly understand.  Focusing on sad white-collar, middle-class Norton whose only real dream in life is to own all the contents of an IKEA catalogue it follows him through a chance meeting with charismatic stranger Pitt and the unfortunate events which conspire to draw them together. After a nights hard drinking they start a friendly-ish scrap which is viewed by a couple of others and from that small acorn a mighty oak called Fight Club grows. This is the point around which the whole film revolves with Norton and Pitt forming an underground club which draws more and more disillusioned young men to join it. Based on firm 'Queensbury Rules' it is a cathartic if bloody way to spend your night. Eventually as it becomes a huge operation Pitt, the de facto leader, moves it up a gear and creates his own cult from this secret society. This is where the film becomes brilliant and the twist near the end is magnificent, better even than the much talked about 'The Sixth Sense'. It just has so much to say about things: the emasculation of an entire generation of young men (""No great war to fight, no great depression""), the growing isolation we all feel from one another and the need to find something to draw us back together and most importantly, the power of an exciting, challenging idea and it's fermentation into cultism. However, where many films would just say 'This is a bad thing' 'Fight Club' doesn't. It is more a condemnation of a materialistic society which has forgotten about a large section of itself. You can empathise with these men completely, even when they band together against this uncaring society that has reared them to be something their instincts don't understand. It's as close to genius as you'll get and one film you'll talk about and think about for days.",_
23,21 October 2005,lee_eisenberg,10, This is what great movies are all about!,"In the grand scheme of things, ""Fight Club"" is less about a group of people who like to fight than about how the commercialism inherent in our society drives people over the edge. The unnamed narrator (Edward Norton) joins up with soap-maker Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) to found Project Mayhem, whose goal is to undermine everything corporate. Part of their modus operandi involves starting fistfights. But at some point, the narrator realizes that it's going too far...and he's helpless to stop the madness.",=
24,26 April 2009,michaelRokeefe,8, Self help to the extreme.,"A dark comedy with a cult following. Director David Fincher takes Chuck Palaniuk's novel to maybe a harsher and dangerous place. Known only as The Narrator(Edward Norton)is a corporate employee that is no longer enchanted by his elaborate apartment and its expensive furnishings and pretty much disenfranchised from life itself and is concerned with his lack of ability to sleep. He attends self-help groups to relish in not being as miserable as the people surrounding him. He meets a suicidal Marla Singer(Helena Bonham Carter), but wants to distance himself from her. Life changing is his meeting with a soap salesman Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt), who is anarchy's poster child. Durden thrives on being a roguish rebel and convinces The Narrator into staging impromptu boxing matches in parking lots and deserted building basements. These matches are bare chested and with bare knuckles. The fighters beat the living crap out of each other until one yells stop. Durden is credited with starting fight clubs across the nation; and eventually turns the clubs into aggression laden pranksters releasing their malice on corporate America.",t
25,2 March 2004,trildog99,10, I am Jack's kick-ass review,"To be honest with you, when I saw the title of the movie, I thought it was going to be another mindless action film.  But then something happened.....I actually watched it.  I thought the movie was genius.  It wasn't so much about fighting.  It was more about schizofrenic office worker that suffered from insomnia.  Brad Pitt, the star of the movie, played his character (Tyler Durden) flawlessly.  Throughout the movie, Ed Norton's character (the narrator) was trying to fight his inner demons which were preventing him from getting any sleep.  With the help of several small terrorist groups, a disturbed female that pretended to suffer from testicular cancer, and Tyler Durden (a self righteous psycho), the narrator can finally resolve his problems.  I feel I would have enjoyed the movie much more had not my brother spoiled the damn ending before I watched it, but even without the surprise ending, Fight Club still makes my top 10.",t
26,26 November 2020,auuwws,10, Fight Club,"Great mom, great performance from Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, great directing from David Fincher, and the way the film was filmed was excellent and it is unfair that the film did not win an Oscar for best film or best directing or ACTOR IN A LEADING ROLE. Knowing that Tyler and the narrator are the same person the movie was full of hints The idea that the film tried to recommend us not to be like Tyler or be like the WWE should be in the middle",_

28,11 October 2018,sebastiandelgah,10, G.O.A.T.,"This movie is one of the greatest of all time. It is adapted from a book by Chuck Palahniuk.
This movie has very interesting themes like emasculation, violence, chaos, societal breakdown, isolation, the threat of death and consumerism.
The direction is sublime. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly. Also they did a good job with the inter-cuts.
Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were the perfect choice to lead this movie.

29,9 March 2021,adammartin-71590,10, Perfect Club!,"This is the movie you must see before you die. Everything about it is bonkers. Very original. Don't expect just another film about fighting there's helluva lot more to it. This is what movies should be, leading you to the unknown of unpredictably.

30,19 September 2014,badfeelinganger,10, A controversial satire and a contemporary classic. perhaps the most post-9/11 film to have been made pre-9/11,"Solid Acting and Amazing Direction A movie that wants to keep its audience unsettled from beginning to end. perhaps the most post-9/11 film to have been made pre-9/11, capturing perfectly both the stirring discontent of the Nineties and the madness both geopolitical and especially economic, that would erupt globally in the decade to come. Wildly inventive, exceptionally cast and undeniably controversial, there's an endless list of subtexts and viewpoints which will fuel debates for years. Fight Club is not just a movie, but a wake up call to a disenfranchised generation sick of being told by advertising what to drive, wear, buy, smoke, drink and eat in order to be cool. Fight Club is still today a definitive film, a statement as strong as any rock anthem and twice as packed with power chords.Essential Hollywood film of 1999.",
31,24 September 2001,robertharkins,10, Great Film: Deserved Several Academy Award Nominations,"The script was tight, the theme fascinating, the acting incredible (especially Edward Norton, as one might expect), the direction inspired, and the cinematography stunning. It is one of the few films of the past five years that deserves to be seen multiple times.  In fact, if you have seen it only once, you have missed something.  I was seriously hoping the movie would receive Oscar nominations for Best Actor (Norton), Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Picture.",
32,21 July 2018,perica-43151,7, This movie is overrated,"The Fight Club movie, like its more successful but equally troubled cousin The Matrix, has some philosophical themes, originality in presentation, and is also strong on satire. Another movie that it is similar in some ways is vastly superior and more intelligent and fun American Psycho. The plot is adapted from the eponymous book, which ""borrows"" ideas from Dostoevsky's ""The Double"" and puts some ""Thus spoke Zarathustra"" along a way. It is derivative and not very good, certainly not as good as its cult followers would suggest. In any case, given the hype, I was expecting more. There are some good points along the way - especially its anticipation of terrorism, and some good transformational scenes, like when confronting a boss, but overall, it comes across as much more shallow than its reputation would suggest. It is high on style and influence, has lot of ideas crammed in and it might have been even revolutionary in some respects for its time (like the Matrix, which I also find a bit missing), so perhaps its worth a watch, but it is not a perfect masterpiece some assume it is. It may seem so to perhaps teens, incels and millenials, but this is not the most successful nor sophisticated rendering of such ideas. Tone your expectations down, give it a try, this is a movie that can work in bits and pieces, has originality, but is sometimes given WAY too much credit.",

They get so close to the greatness mark, enticing you with how good they are, and then, at the last second, as if to spite you, they pull back and go for the Hollywood ending.

37,5 December 2007,uhmartinez-phd,5, A Pretty Looking Nightmare,"David Fincher is terrific with his camera. Visually his films are a wonder. Unfortunately the contents are so thin that the interiors of his tale vanish very quickly. What remains is ""the look"" and the promise, no matter how unfulfilled the promise remains. Edward Norton is sensational, especially in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Brad Pitt, already a film icon, does his thing, and that, of course, is a plus. Helena Bonham Carter surprised me big time with a facade I had never seen. The slow motion of the smoke coming out of her mouth as Fincher introduces her to us is a work of art in itself but, and that ""but"" is a real problem, nothing remains because deep down there is nothing there but a fantastic eye for and to startle and amaze. I'm sure that sooner or later David Fincher will come out with something that is as powerful inside as it is outside.",
38,18 November 2013,alishahmohd,5, Honestly did not enjoy this movie at all......,"Fight Club is regarded as a fantastic movie and it is currently rated in the IMDb top ten. I guess this was supposed to be a movie for a specific generation, or for the people who were actively watching films in 1999. I still to this day do not understand what all the fuss is about? Yes this film is different from the traditional action and drama films but just because its different, it doesn't mean its good let alone fantastic or a work of art. ",
39,21 March 2003,Decko_koji_obecava,3, Style over substance.,"This is a good example of what happens when people who've been reading comic books and watched better movies all their lives get to make their own. I may be wrong in my assessment of David Fincher's adolescent pursuits but the point I'm trying to get at is that there is very little articulate and nothing even remotely original about ""Fight Club"". Both conceptually and visually it seems to be one big incoherent, messy smorgasbord of Orwell, early '90s MTV, Kubrick, punk, etc, etc.",
40,29 February 2020,zhyarTheChosen,7, So good but what an ending,I really hated the ending the whole movie was such a great thing but it dosen't deserve 8.8,
41,6 February 2005,filmquestint,5, Fincher's half,"I sat through the first half of this movie with my mouth open. It was so exciting, brilliant, a Fritz Lang for the new millennium. Edward Norton's face. That insomnia that he carries all over him is so magnificently drawn that creates the opposite effect on its audience. I was awake, very awake, sitting on the edge of my seat, devouring every moment, enjoying it like hell. Helena Bonham Carter was a like a great silent movie star doing her first talkie. Pola Negri, Theda Bara. As if this wan't enough, Brad Pitt, and Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt with all its fabulous connotations. Then, can you explain to me why I detested this movie? Why it made me so angry? Can you? I can only tell you that half way through I turned against the movie or the movie turned against me, either way I didn't like it. I felt cheated in the worse possible way. I felt treated like a moron. You start promising me the most unique film experience I've had in a long time but what you delivered was a tired, opportunistic, gimmicky, easy piece of nonsense. Why? David Fincher is one of the most consummated craftsmen American movies have ever had. Don't you agree? He can tell you a story, even something like ""Seven"", a horror thriller, in a way we've never seen before, at least half of it. He has an eye like no other. That's why my frustration. An artist like that putting himself at the service of something that's not done, not finished not worthy of his talents. You may think I'm being a bit too hard on the man. But let me tell you, it's out of love. I expect so much from him, I've seen what he is capable of. But so far have been only halves. Brilliantly acted, sensational to look at, but halves, just halves. He should look at Fritz Lang, Pietro Germi, Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Powell, William Wellman and naturally John Ford, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Fincher already inherited something from each one of them. Now the trick is that it isn't a trick. Half is better than nothing. But in the grand scheme of things, it's not enough.",
42,29 November 1999,tyler.td,10, Probably the best movie of the decade,After watching this movie I was totally filled with enthusiasm. Fight Club is definitly Fincher's best movie even better than se7en. It's not only the story but the optics which fascinated me. When I had seen it for the second time I could see this movie with the knowledge of the conclusion which is really fascinating as you'll see Fight Club in a totally different perspective. Also great about Fight Club is its soundtrack performed by the Dust Brothers and especially the song 'Where is my mind' by the Pixies which really fit to the end of the movie. Unfortunately Fight Club didn't have much success in Germany but anyway the movie got best reviews of the German press. I also have to mention the brilliance of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt who plays best in roles in which he performs the villain. But it's quiet amazing what Edward Norton is able to do - he is just overwhelming. For that role he has to get the oscar.,

The wrap up is about as plain stupid as it gets and essentially invalidates everything before it.  I don't mean to be harsh, but who the heck is voting on these movies on Imdb?

At the moment, the rating of this movie is higher, but if it comes above Inception, I will no longer appear on IMDb. Because this movie is not science fiction, but it is ten times more effective than a good science fiction. And this is very important. A realistic film is so effective in terms of storytelling. You see, at the same time, there is a lot of complexity in it. And you can enjoy watching it many times. Brad Pitt is completely one with his role. And it doesn matter that the movie is criticizing politics. What is most important is the depiction of modern man, and it is one of the few films that is even better than the original book.",

49,10 July 2004,The_Real_Review,1, Overrated by wanna-be intellectuals,"SPOILER!!! This is one of a few movies overrated by wanna-be intellectuals. The script is slick in that it disguises its propaganda. Propaganda you ask? Lets start off with the FACT that Edward Norton's character in this movie is psychotic and Brad Pitt's doesn't exist. Brad Pitt's character Tyler Durden is a figment of Norton's imagination because Norton's character is psychotic. This whole plot twist becomes even more aggravating when you realized you wasted over two hours watching a movie about a psychotic anarchist. The movie's message is great for impressionable kids; the system is against you so how to succeed is through violence in some cases terrorism. Please, spare me the rhetoric. I realize the movie is fiction but it does not excuse it. Even fiction should entertain; this just drags you down into the sewer and gives impressionable misguided kids bad ideas. Sort of what the Clock Work Orange did for racists and neo-Nazis.",

One night while at a friends house they were raving aobut Fight Club and someone had brought it over to watch. i wasn't into seeing it but what else could i do.

51,18 October 1999,golight,10, A rare film that challenges the viewer to come up with his own interpretations,"Faithfully following Chuck Palahniuk's acerbic satire, Fight Club presents the vast emptiness of modern existence- ridden as it is with shallow values, rampant consumerism, empty of meaning, feeling and life itself- in a slick and ironically consumer oriented fashion.  In a different vein from American Beauty, Fight Club explores the solutions to the veritable sleepwalking existence that plagues modern life.  The film is violent, but it is not gratuitous violence, and any reviewer who claims that the film is promoting violence has missed the entire point of the film. A very black comedy, it is sure to provoke much conversation- it is definitely a film to see with friends.  The film is fast-paced, densely packed and merits a second viewing, just to take it all in, especially if you haven't read the book. In typical Fincher style, you the viewer are left to draw your own conclusions. He feels no impetus to tell you how to interpret what you've seen, appropriate since the film condemns falling victim to the strictures of what society tells us to think and to value.  My only criticism is that the editing is not as tight as it could be in the middle section of the film, it drags just a bit then picks up again. Other than that, it should definitely be an Oscar contender.",
52,15 February 2000,rmic,10, Generally positive comments,"This film, is basically, at least in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever, period.  I read the book afterwards, and equally enjoyed the book. The film is definitely for younger people, the critics of films, in general are older, so they cannot appreciate this film.  The film defines the younger generation, only younger people can relate to it, however, older people(middle aged+) can appreciate the art of the film, the beauty of the camera work, as well as the excellent acting.  The film, in every aspect is fantastic, it begins with a rather humorous narration, from a person we grow to know as, ""narrator"".  It goes about to show how he lives, and his way of life.  In these scenes alone, movie lines that will go down in history are said, and it's only the first twenty minutes.  The film tends to progress faster and faster as the film continues.  We delve into the narrators psyche, and find that he is not unlike most people in this world, he has a tendency to say to people what they want to hear, even if it is not the truth in it's entirety.  Almost all folks can relate to the main character, and he feels to be a real human, not a character in a story.  This, is partially due to the excellent directing, as well as book, but it is mostly due to the fantastic performance by Edward Norton. It, in my opinion is an Oscar performance.  Bradd Pitt gives his best performance to date, he is definitely an excellent coworker with David Fincher, they seem to share a common thread when it comes to film making I suppose.  I have full intention of purchasing this film when it is released on VHS and DVD.  Do yourself a favour, see this film, if that is not an option, at least read the book.  If you are younger and feel unrest with society, this is the film.",

It is strikingly thought provoking and visually stimulating. The direction is incredibly brilliant. Director David Fincher (Aliens, Se7en and The Game) is at his finest here warping both space and time, dropping in things here and there to make things clear. Edward Norton is excellent as Jack, the narrator of the movie. He is a nerdy insomniac who catalog shops at Ikea and has a going nowhere job. Brad Pitt is dynamic as Tyler Durden, an anarchistic man who lives in a run-down abandoned house and makes and sells soap for a living. Helen Bonham Carter is also great as Marla Singer, the manic-depressive chain-smoking woman in both their lives. Her role is critical and she plays it well.",

Due to the buildup I expected something pretty good. My enthusiasm went progressively downhill as I watched the story develop and when Ed Norton performs the revealing scene (Which I suppose I should not describe here) I felt like pulling the tape out right there, I was that insulted. I am struck with jaw dropping amazement at the vote results here in IMDB. What possible value does this movie have to place it higher than so many great films in the top 250 list? I have a feeling that this flick speaks to the 16 to 21 year old male (the same group that the worlds armies traditionally love to make eager immortal uncritical soldiers from).

63,28 August 2001,fubared1,1, One of the dumbest movies ever!,"Yes, these days it's hard to single out a movie as exceedingly dumb, when people rave about crap like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'The Matrix', but this must take a special prize.  At least in this case, this qualifies as a 'so bad it's good' exercise, whereas the others were just mindless bores.  Of course, it's largely thanks to the incredibly bad acting of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt, who should form a triumvirate with Keanu Reeves as the most overpaid, talentless bunch of numbnuts ever to grace the screen with their lack of talent.  In fact, the only good performance here is by Meatloaf, which is saying a lot.  If you think the plot is original, it's not.  The same idea was presented in a half hour episode of 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' over 30 years ago, that was directed by the master himself. Still, even if it was faked, I did greatly enjoy seeing Pitt and Norton beating each other to a bloody pulp.  They both certainly deserve it for their past (and future) 'work'.",

But weren't we all?",
66,28 September 2018,mstanger-99388,9, A Favorite and a Classic!,"Ever since I first watched this movie a few years back with some of my friends, I loved it. It became a sort of habit of ours to watch it every couple weeks or at least once a month while we laughed and quoted the whole thing for fun. 
 Anyways, what makes this movie better than what the 1999 box office credited it with, is the filmography. My favorite use of camera and film techniques probably had to be the moment where Tyler describes the meaningless of possessions in a shot inside their house as it wobbles from side to side. His calm demeanor reminds you more of Jack rather than himself and his more aggressive tone, creating a sense of foreshadowing the ultimate climax when Jack realizes he is Tyler and Tyler is him. It's also very interesting to see the change from a clear and sunny day in the city to the yellow-tinted bars, basements, and ultimately the abandoned house Jack and Tyler live in at night. There's a feeling of the underground's grime and dirt in these transitions, as well as a feel for the tougher moments in life that are a central theme in this movie.
 This movie also made a high ranking for me because it makes you think. In 1999, people were looking for stability in the shadow of Y2K. They weren't thinking about giving up everything they had, but preserving it and gathering more possessions, as highlighted throughout the film yet again as a central theme. This film goes exactly against contemporary consumer society at the time by instead of telling people to ""buy stuff we don't need"", it emphasizes the ideas of minimalism and even tribalism in some aspects when Tyler talks about ""starting over"" again. What sticks with this movie is that it's message still sticks to us today, perhaps even stronger than in 1999.",

68,16 July 2016,hjpog,10, A complete classic.,"First, for this great masterpiece, I would like to thank David Fincher. The film gives a great message on psychology. But the main purpose is to show what level shambles of today's youth. The film tackles the decline of today's youth in a very hard way. Consumer culture can be said to start with the Starbucks glasses we have seen in the film in many scenes. Consumption in the film can be one of the parts that best describes the society. The Narrator is happiest not in consumption, but in Tyler's punches. It is not a fight against the system, but in the film Fight Club is a rebellious aim. Everyone is alone in the consumer society. Officially something new comes out after today's young people run the thing themselves or dedicate themselves to always search for a leader, this problem offers in a great way the audience. Acting I can say enormous. Formally integrated the roles of the players. Already today, many people have come by Tyler Durden character of history is considered as the best anti-hero. Every part of the film is filled with great criticism about our day. Also great to send on to mention other films. One of the most important elements of the film I'd say the mystery. Indeed, for someone with no knowledge of the subject monitors and film for the first time in a very difficult prediction about the end of the film. Absolutely should for everyone to see, and even to do bedside film is a masterpiece..",

And since I saw it on video, I could use slo-mo to catch Brad's ""Where's Waldo"" bits. As soon as Norton met Brad, it was all downhill. Even a really fine, insightful actor would have had a hard time making those pretentious lines sound significant, but Brad Pitt's spewing of them was like a nearsighted used car dealer reading cue cards. This movie was so obvious, so pretentious, and such a total con job, right up to the absurd plot twist three-quarters of the way through that completely invalidated everything that came before it. Also, for a movie that was so preachy about consumerism (""You are not your car, your khakis,"" all that hackneyed nonsense), did anyone else notice that all the tired young execs at Fight Club proper seemed to spend alot of time at the gym? Nary a pot belly to be found, save for poor Meat Loaf, who was somehow exempt from the ""no shirt/no shoes"" rule. Large-breasted Meat Loaf fighting shirtless--now that would have been shocking.",

People say this movie is great. Insightful. Exhilarating. I say it's complete trash and almost a waste of time. The characters aren't bad, except for that really ugly lady (change your hair and clean yourself up). She plays some psycho nymphomaniac who falls for Tyler Durden's (Brad Pitt) body. Eventually those two get together and have constant sex, which gets really old because the house is shaking all the time and the narrator explains how annoying it is. Soon the story gets boring and we find that the Fight Club is really a group of losers who are deviant maniacs bent on disrupting society. Let's face it, the only reason anyone should ever watch this movie all the way through is to find out that Tyler Durden is actually the narrator, and the narrator is Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden doesn't even exist. That twist really fell below the status of ""bad"". This movie really falls below the status of ""annoying, stupid, boring, disgusting, monotonous, and ridiculous"". The music reeks, the acting isn't great, the storyline is awful, the plot is stupid, and nothing fits together real well to make this movie solid. I implore everyone to avoid this movie.",
77,26 August 2011,classicsoncall,8," ""We have front row seats for this theater of mass destruction"".","There's a not so subtle irony in the premise of this picture that managed to intrude on my consciousness about the time I learned about Strinne green stripe patterns. Society's obsession with material goods has a dehumanizing effect on the individual, leading some to destructive behavior in an attempt to rid the shackles of mindless adherence to a herd mentality. Whenever this idea is presented in a commercial venture however, it itself falls victim to a form of circular logic. The success of the film depends on it's ability to denigrate itself as a form of commercial enterprise or achievement. The same can be said of the principal players; I highly doubt that Brad Pitt or Ed Norton go around bemoaning the fact that their wealth is somehow an obstacle to their self worth as human beings. There's an element of hypocrisy in all this, but I won't begrudge the actors or director for their part in it.

So  here I go.  Fight Club is a very strange, erratic movie that, quite honestly,  nearly put me to sleep within the first ten minutes. It seemed that the  whole movie revolved around an insomniac! And that's true--this movie  is about nothing but a guy who can't sleep. For over half of it seems  to be the very first movie that has no plot, no decent characters (what  kind of main character is known only as ""The Narrator""?), and a crummy  soundtrack. I was SO disappointed.  ""Plot Outline: A man disillusioned by what his life has become  encounters an exciting stranger who introduces him to a new way of  life.""  Well, yeah, that's all fine and dandy, but this new way of life doesn't  come in until WAY later. And once Fight Club is finally introduced, it  is hardly shown. Then it turns into a macho group of terrorists... I'm  sorry, but how utterly boring! From the commercials and video cover, I  was expecting there to be a plot that revolved around the Fight Club.  Instead, I was slapped in the face with this stupid terrorist group  that doesn't serve a purpose.  I now have to go to Helena Bonham Carter. Hey, lady, you did excellent  in Planet of the Apes! But in this movie she plays as a rival  counseling group member (speaking of which, what purpose do these  groups serve for the movie?  NOTHING!  The final conflict, in which The Narrator (boy, that name is just so  cool) is fighting ""himself"", is utterly pathetic. How boring. And then  the buildings topple... and that's the end. Ho! Wait! I see a naked man  from the waist down at the ending! Maybe this is the second reason  people liked this stupid, boring movie so much. It shows both female  AND male anatomy.  How stupid! Repulsive! I DESPISED this movie. Now you know why. If, in  fact, you STILL don't understand, listen closely:  1. Boring 2. No plot (adds to number 1) 3. Shallow characters 4. Actual  film has hardly anything to do with its title 5. Constant  swearing/nudity that sickened me 6. Music was cruddy  Basically, this film reeked of anything but stupidity.

There is a lame plot twist, which should not surprise most viewers, that blows the story full of holes and turns the movie from merely bad to abominably bad, culminating in a laughably ludicrous finale. The message of this paean to sado-masochism is that a man has to suffer and inflict pain on others in order to...sell tickets. What is most disturbing is that many consider this vile piece of garbage to be a masterpiece, a sad reflection of our society.",

For the rest of us, this is lecturing nonsense from a writer whom ought to have all his pens, pencils and word processors taken away from him.

After some grief from Durden, he beats him before eventually being subdued himself by a blood soaked Durden slobbering all over him.

Do yourself a favor and read it completely.,"The problem is: most people don't understand the movie but love it anyways, because of the great actors. The main story is about the narrator's (Ed Norton) spiritual awakening process, caused by a huge amount of mental suffering. The suffering is a result of identifying with his ego, identifying with the things he owns, and the roles he plays in a hypocritical society that worships fakeness. Identifying with the ego always leads to unhappiness - sooner or later. He suffers from insomnia, he is sleepless for months, because he is deeply depressed. And nobody can help him, not even the doctor. When his suffering reaches a limit of more than a person could bear, the awakening process begins and it happens unconsciously: it is a self-healing process. He starts hallucinating, which is a natural protection mechanism of the human mind when mental and physical pain is more than a person can stand. (in real-life terms this is called Psychosis) (happening in real lives of real people, caused by the same problem). The subconscious mind of the narrator creates a hallucination, which is a guy who is showing him, where the problem is coming from, and what he needs to do to solve the problem: Tyler Durden. The narrator doesn't know that it is a creation of his own, self-healing mind. Tyler is telling him things like: stop identifying with the ego, with the things you own, and with the roles, you play in that hypocritical society. Be what you really are, you are not designed to follow the orders of hypocrites. And don't run away from pain. (and more, but that would be too much now). All of this is 100% equal to the teachings of ZEN Buddhism in order to achieve awakening and enlightenment, (more examples: he destroys fancy ego-feeding cars with a golf bat but lets the ordinary cars untouched. Another example: Tyler Durden destroys the ego of the Club Mayhem recruits first before they become a member of this club. He also teaches them to lose fights intentionally in order to destroy the ego. The entire movie is about these things. Once you know it, you see it permanently in the movie.)
at the end of the movie, he is awakened. The suffering is gone. Even the injury of the gunshot into his mouth doesn't matter to him anymore. The suffering before was way more painful than the injury he has from that gunshot. He says ti Marla: "".......it's all good. Everything is gonna be fine..."" . Again; awakenings and enlightenments like this, caused by suffering are happening in real life to real people. But most people commit suicide before it is happening., because they couldn't stand the pain and suffering before.",

Norton is the kind of actor whom you either can or cannot watch (I haven't totally decided yet), Bonham Carter still delivers a phoney stateside accent (Woody Allen obviously hasn't helped), and Pitt only looks good in his eye to eye hotel room sequence with Norton (anyone who claims they see him as a good actor is either lying or is deluded - the guy just looks good with cropped hair). Other than this we're looking at a film made for awkward teenage boys who can't watch it anyway cause it's mostly rated 18.

150,10 July 2002,casey_choas66,1, Pass,If director David Fincher wanted us to honestly believe that we have not evolved one bit from the scum that at one point inhabited this earth than he has brillantly done it. The first problem I have with this film is that it drags on about a half an hour to long and trust me that half an hour at the end could possibly be the stuipidest ending ever. What starts off as a promising look at a bunch of low lives letting off some stream by beating the hell out of each other (mainly due to the always great Edward Norton) slowing take a nose dive into pure stupidity. This movie becomes so trashy I had to take a shower directly after watching it to feel clean again. The main problem with this film is that there is only about 15 minutes of fighting the rest is a bunch of losers running around the city destroying things and then turns into a comptly unbeliveable ghost story. The film is not a complete watse though due to several amusing scene in Which Ed Norton punches Brad Pitt in the ear and when Pitt edits images of male genitalia into childrens movies. But besides that this could very well be the worst movie I've ever seen. So unless there is absolutly no other options steer clear of this trashy mess.,
151,25 November 2019,andrewmerritt-31652,10, If you think this is about fighting you fail to understand its message,"Fight Club stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, and is directed by David Fincher. The plot revolves around an unnamed narrator, who is bored with his job, until he befriends Tyler Durden, a care free person, and together they start a fight club. Fight Club was one of those movies where I watched it, and I felt inspired. Not inspired to start a fight club, but the overall message was what really spoke to me. Fight Club teaches the audience that we are scared of our lives, which is why we work those boring nine-five jobs because we do what society tells us to do. And that's why we buy stuff we don't need so we can also fit into society as well having the media hypnotizing us that one day we'll be happy with that one special person, but that's a lie. And if people refuse to accept that, well then you just haven't discovered the big picture. And no one explains that well than Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden is the person that everyone wants to be him and act like him and he's my inspiration to me because he has a care free attitude toward life and I admire that. When Fight Club was released, it got terrible reviews, but later on it has become a cult movie. And i think the reason it has such a strong cult following, was because when it first was released, nobody understood it, but they instead they thought it was just about fighting. But there's more to it than fighting and that's where people fail to understand this film. And every time I watch Fight Club, the more i understand what it was trying to tell us. So in the end, Fight Club is a punk rock version of A Clockwork Orange, has a very strong message, and something you shouldn't ignore just because it has to do with fighting. And remember the first rule of Fight Club is, you do not talk about Fight Club.",

Firstly, how the club becomes so popular that office workers, policemen, bus drivers, taxi drivers, etc. participate in it...? it sounds like nonsense, doesn't it? Secondly, they become so powerful that they change into a sort of terrorist army that destroys official buildings in a fight against materialism... if they're so powerful, why do they need to destroy buildings? Thirdly, the film reaches in its final part a pretended twist-in-the-end in which the main character suffers a double personality syndrome; apart that this has been yet treated in films like Psycho, in the film it's something more than a psychriatic disturbance; it's like a 'ghostly syndrome', since the main character seems to be hit by a ghost as can be seen in the vigilance cameras' images, and he finally shots himself in his mouth and doesn't die. You can build a brainy interpretation about everything, and say it's an allegory about the problems in modern society and the like, but for me it's not that profound. Also, the comic moments -like the man with the big breasts'- are for me tasteless. And the extreme violence unnecessary. I'll give it a 6 out of 10, and I think I'm being generous with my rating.",

I looked at IMDb's top 250 and I was familiar and unfamiliar with some of the films on that list. I decided to watch some of the films on that list and I wanted to watch Fight Club first because it just attracted me in ways I can't explain. Watching Fight Club was an amazing and great experience. The movie is about 2 hours and 30 minutes long, but for me, it actually felt like the whole film was an hour and a half long! One of the many great things about Fight Club are the acting. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt have oscar worthy performances in this film, and they are very different and unique characters. Helena Bonham Carter has very good acting in this film as well, and her and Brad Pitt are the funniest things in this movie. This film is probably one of the best dark comedies ever. The camera work in this film is outstanding. The zooms, the wide angle shots, and every frame in this film is beautiful. The ideas that Brad Pitt's character expresses are very thought provoking, and proves that this film has the style and the substance as well. The soundtrack is very catchy and the editing is also praise worthy. The twist (that I won't spoil) is also executed in such a creative way, it is one of the best parts of this film and it gives this movie rewatchability. I showed this film to one of my family members, and she said that the film was satisfying. I actually 100% agree with her because all of the lines that are said and the things that happen in this film all add up and gives out the sense of satisfaction.

The movie ends with a shot renowned for how well-correographed, hauntingly scored and epically shot it is. It stylistically ties a perfect bow arround its preceding two hours, creating an image whose power is so immense that it can lead to completely opposing interpretation depending on who you ask, with some saying it endorces anarchism, some calling it fascist propaganda and others (myself included) seeing a poignant criticism of false prophets like Tyler after so masterfully portraying their appeal to the impressionable masses bursting with resentment.",

The way it ends is also extremly special in the fact that its hard to tell if its the bad guys or the good guys that won. Its hard for us to know if we are supposed to rule or not for a character like Tyler Durden. The final twist is extremely good and its presented in a very unpredicted way. This movie is like somebody with a mental dissorder. Everything is chaotic, brutal, controversial and suddent. Most of these things are in part because of David Fincher's direction. Its direction is simply flawless, there not a single error in the direction! And it might seem like it is fully flawed when you look on its surface but if you look closer you always find out that it has no error!

Utilizing brilliant techniques and special effects, it was quite something to witness. 10 years later, the film still holds it's own. It truly is a great film and stands out among a Hollywood filled with mediocre. Knowing the outcome, that Tyler is not real, makes a second viewing a altogether new experience, as the viewer finds themselves aware of scenes with the key characters in and figuring out how or where it is possible to have the characters and their actions work. The cast is fine in this, I especially liked Helena Bonham Carter in this. The visual elements make for a great film experience as well: The explanation of the explosion in the apartment: the appearance of Ikea furniture: the decrepit house and the airplane ripping apart are many of the stand out moments.

It stars Edward Norton who hates his job and suffers from insomnia. He attends support groups where he encounters misfit Marla as well as a heavy set individual described as having one testicle. On a plane he meets the mysterious Tyler Durden who manufactures soap, which he uses to make bombs. Violence is their common lust as they invite bystanders into their fight club. Clever and stylish with an ending where facing one's issues takes on a new form. David Fincher's films often involve traumatic events to accept life as seen in his Seven and The Game. Norton is placed between reason and personal detachment. Brad Pitt mixes insane authority with maddening humour. Their concluding showdown is brilliantly filmed but it raises more questions than answers. Helena Bonham Carter plays Marla who has suicidal tendencies and psychotic sexual conquests. Meatloaf plays a brute at a help group who joins the fight club but despite his intensity he fails to understand the consequences of this decision. Jared Leto plays Angel Face, a fellow member whom Norton views as competition for Durden's favor. Extremely violent yet exhilarating social commentary of violence, trauma and mental stability.

It's the taut pacing and screw-tightening screenplay that ratchets up both the tension and confusion, the perfect performances that sell the sometimes silly seeming goings-on and the perfectionist grimy direction that points the viewer in one direction while doing something vastly important in the other that all add up to make the experience a lasting and memorable one that feels as though it has something to say, gets under your skin and works on multiple viewings to equally successful effect. 8/10",
190,15 September 2011,Red-Barracuda,8, High on adrenalin and visually inventive,"This often pretty brutal examination of the male psyche is certainly a very dynamic piece of film-making. David Fincher has to be given a great deal of credit for imbuing his film with an enormous amount of energy and invention. It's a movie infused with adrenalin both thematically and stylistically. So job well done. The two lead actors are massive in contributing to this. Ed Norton supplies the edge, while Brad Pitt the movie star charisma. Both are ideal in their respective roles. There is a wicked sense of humour present throughout the film with a number of very funny moments. While the sense of the bizarre is ever present. This is hardly a realist strand of film-making. Fight Club is a dramatic film that is very fantastical. It doesn't really make it's intentions very clear cut. It leaves you the audience to decide for yourself what you make of it. This no doubt contributed to it's initial failure at the box office. It requires a bit more work from the viewer than most films. But it is also one of those movies that demands to be re-watched; it comes at you from an entirely different angle when you know the outcome in advance.

The film is tough and unyielding in its machismo, and although it is occasionally off-putting, I was never bored watching it. The acting, by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton in particular, is quite good; the two stars have obviously been put through the wringer in their roles, and director David Fincher keeps cranking up the tension and puts us through the wringer as well.

But actually I think that's not a bad way to watch it. This is quite an ambitious film, a lot of themes and ideas are being tossed around in the film that aren't directly anchored to the characters. Or the character as the case may be. I did really like the movie, but I thought that at times it got too slick with its presentation. It suffers from the same faults as all action films despite being a satire of action films on a certain level -- the action simply can't be intense enough to hold the hardcore audience's attention in the beginning and still ratchet up to something even more grotesque without becoming completely unreal and potentially laughable in and of itself.

195,11 September 2011,drqshadow-reviews,10," Infinitely Quotable, Ruthlessly Unpredictable, Genuinely Unforgettable","What started out as one of my four or five favorite films has only grown better over time. Terribly marketed in its theatrical run as a knuckle-dragging modern rendition of Bloodsport, it's sharper, wittier and ballsier than almost any major studio film of the last two decades. It's a rapidly escalating thrill ride that never hesitates to crank the dial a bit further, and the progression from droll normalcy to vulgar aggression to unsettling calm in the face of a genuine revolution is stunning. On top of all that, the film's wit is off the charts, still intelligent and amusing after almost two dozen viewings. Its cast of characters is wildly varied, and its smirk- smeared musings on the nature of modern masculinity remain timely even today. I actually get shivers every time I revisit particular scenes, with the biggest one coming - reliably - just moments before the credits roll when that Pixies tune kicks in and the city skyline takes a new shape. That's what I call an impressive parting shot. A smart, funny, thrilling, unpredictable modern classic that never takes the easy road. I can't imagine I'll ever grow tired of it.",
196,14 May 2001,MadReviewer,6, Yet Another Victim Of Keyser Soze Disease,"Edgy, disturbing, and hard-hitting in places, `Fight Club' is a decent film that fails to ultimately live up to its initial promise.  With a devious, deftly handled opening half-hour, it's actually quite shocking how clumsy and awkward the later stages of `Fight Club' become.  It's almost as though director David Fincher so desperately wants the audience to get the point of his film, he's willing to beat the audience of the head with that point - and by doing so, the message of `Fight Club' gets lost.",

Ed Norton had already done a brilliant movie about fascist-wannabes with ""American X,"" so what was the point of getting involved in this mess?

208,8 July 2012,brando647,10, David Fincher's Best and One of My Favorites,"I'm just going to cut to the chase: FIGHT CLUB is awesome. I wish the marketing for the film had been a tad more honest because I put off seeing this movie until almost a decade after it was released. And, even then, I only watched it because I was at a buddy's place and needed something to watch. I was totally caught off guard because I'd always assumed it was just some testosterone-fueled beat-down with some bare bones semblance of a plot. This was before I knew of the awesome that is director David Fincher or author Chuck Palahniuk. This movie is much more than I expected, it's masterfully done, and it's developed a bizarre following on the Web. I just think it's an awesome movie. It's become one of my favorites. The movie follows a nameless protagonist (Edward Norton) who narrates the film. He's an insomniac wallowing in his empty life when he crosses paths with a charismatic soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). When the Narrator's apartment goes up in a mysterious explosion, he turns to Durden and together they form an underground fight club where men can let loose and beat the tar out of each other. The fight club is only the beginning, as the clubs gain popularity and spread across the nation. The members eventually devolve into a near cult status with Tyler Durden as their leader and the next phase of his grand schemes comes forth: Project Mayhem. Have I mentioned that FIGHT CLUB is awesome?",
209,24 February 2015,Horst_In_Translation,6, Solid character study and a good performance from Norton,"""Fight Club"" is an Academy Award nominated (sound effects) movie from roughly 15 years ago starring Edward Norton (a two-time Academy Award nominee before he turned 30), Brad Pitt, Meat Loaf and Helena Bonham Carter. It's possibly the most famous movie from director David Fincher, although it's far from his best in my opinion. That does not mean it's a bad film. Not at all. However, many of the characters are simply too over the top and the film is in constant danger of surpassing the fine line between entertainment and ridiculousness. It's based on a Palahniuk novel (his most known) and the script comes from Jim Uhls, who had a surprisingly insignificant career after coming up with the words for this cult film.",

Of the thousands of films I have seen in my life, only two have been so bad that I could not sit through the entire film. Fight Club is one of those two movies.",
212,3 June 2008,bobsgrock,10," Disturbing and brutal, yet has a distinct message.","After viewing Fight Club, a lot of ideas will run through your mind. This is the sign of a great film. It doesn't just entertain and hold you in suspense; any simple, ordinary film can do that. David Fincher's extraordinary tale about male aggression and the oppression we face from everyday marketing and materialism takes all this to another level, pushing us to the very maximum that we are able to handle. It all starts out so simple and dark: a nameless, obsolete insurance worker sleepwalks through his life all the while working a job he hates to buy crap he doesn't need. He needs a change and the audience knows this as well. For the first 30-40 minutes of the movie, we get a dark tone of political and social satire that really makes you think of what kind of film this is. Then, it all changes. Just like Edward Norton's character, our entire experience is jolted when Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden steps into the frame. For the rest of the running time, we are thrown and tossed about back and forth, helplessly watching this confusion and chaos bring itself to light. At times, we have to scratch our heads as it can get carried out of hand, but never does this film get off track and fall into obscurity. There is a clear message here, although it may have multiple explanations. Cinematically, this is one of the most brilliantly-shot movies in recent memory. Fincher's directing style is so clever and slick that it perfectly complements the settings and the acting. That being said, the acting is some of the best you will see in any movie. Brad Pitt is mesmerizing and easy to hate at the same time, and Helena Bonham Carter gives a strong supporting role. However, it is the work of Edward Norton that makes this movie memorable and stays with you long after it is over. In every scene he is in, and there are a lot of them, Norton perfectly captures the attitude and feelings of the Narrator. At first, he is depressed and out of touch with reality. As the story moves on, he becomes more aware and self-destructive. The audience also becomes more involved as we wonder where this could lead. Perhaps the most striking thing about Fight Club is that the premise is entirely plausible. It is not ridiculous at all to think that such an idea could spring up and alter the course of many peoples' lives. Still, this film provides more warning than suggestions. Simply put, this film is not just for entertainment value. There is much more here than meets the eye. Of course, not everyone will take it for anything other than face value. But, if you look closer and really try to understand this fascinating story, you will see a message; just don't be able to decipher it anytime soon.",

230,11 June 2005,David_Frames,10, Essential Viewing,"There's a certain poetic nobility in Fight Club's disappointing box-office performance. After all, here's a movie that attacks product, profit and the capitalist doctrine and fails to be consumed - not what anyone intended but would it really do for the people involved to make an enormous windfall on the back of its release? It hardly matters anyway because anyone involved in Fight Club must have known that they'd made something so good that it would be adequate reward just to be associated with it. It's a seminal piece of work - a perfect conflation of visual and conceptual imagination that's as deceptive as one of Tyler's bars of soap. You may have thought you were going to see a movie about men beating each other up and the delicious truth is that that's just what many Americans DID think only to be confronted by a film that challenged the most basic assumptions upon which the western world functions - namely that unrestrained, free market commercial enterprise increases wealth and subsequently the quality of life. But Planet Starbucks isn't a paradise, it's nothingness and here's a film that says so more directly than most. Ed Norton's narrator is the emptiness at the heart of the system, emasculated by modernism, numbed by consumption - his life is a corporate by-product and the need to feel some kind of quantifiable human emotion creates Tyler Durden, an unrestrained force for personal liberation. Tyler's destructive counter-cultural revolution is an unflinching satirical knife to the throat of the thinking that blunts so many of us and it's astonishing to see this level of angry denunciation in a mainstream Hollywood movie. Fincher's movie is punk rock film-making, indifferent to the generic considerations that shape most American cinema and one which forces you to think about yourself and the forces that control your life. Freedom is an illusion Tyler shows us and Fincher reinforces this notion by drawing attention to the medium's illusionary potential in a series of virtuoso sequences which shatter that so-called forth wall just as the characters try and break free from the all-consuming commercial blandification of the modern world. A great film the first time you see it, a different film the second time and even better - Fight Club is a perfectly composed reaction to the modern age and its false promises. This movie really does have something important to say, whether you're ready to hear it or not is a different matter. Liberation starts here kids.",

Yes, we've seen it before, but Norton's performance in the first part of the film brings the script to life.  And then along comes a solid dose of Hollywood machismo, wrapped up in a buff, Brad Pitt package.  Now here's what I have a real problem with: all these young men find salvation through beating each other senseless. Okay, athletic competition has long served that purpose; remember varsity football? But it only goes so far...and the movie's only half over.  What does that leave: a paramilitary organization (!?!?), a weak ending, and an attempt to turn bonding-through-brutality into a way of life.

Sums up how great this piece of cinema is. Fincher is marvelous. Jeff too. Pitt, Norton, Bonham-Carter are simply whoa. Loved the film. Nihilistic Schizo. Chaos Anarchy and Mayhem.",

257,4 October 2001,darth-chico,1, Fincher is out of control.,"David Fincher. I think his career might have been a tragedy if he actually made some good early films. He had alot of promise but is now sucked into the world of the fanboy where he reins as their god. This world is made up of angry youth, most of whom like computers, violence, and sex, though they are underexperienced with it in actuality. No more evident is this than in Fight Club. If you need proof read one of the hundred claims that this is the pinnacle of filmmaking. ",
258,17 October 1999,PWadeThompson,1, worst movie,"I wasted $6.50 tonight seeing Fight Club.  I plan on returning to the theatre tomorrow and requesting a refund from the manager because I do not want my dollars supporting such a movie.  I would call it a film, but it does not deserve such an honor.  The best way I can describe this movie is to say that I came away from it feeling visually and mentally raped.  It was thoroughly violent, but violence is not what offended me most.  The violence for violence' sake offended me.  The pointlessness of the movie offended me. The ""God hates you"" dialogue offended me.  I was glad to see that 2 other people had already agreed with me and given the movie a rating of 1.  Do not waste your money on this movie.  Do not waste your time on this movie.  Brad Pitt fans - resist the urge to see this attack on your self-worth and intelligence. I could go on, but you get the picture.  Fight Club - Stay Away.",
259,18 February 2001,JPhish,1, Didn't really like it,"First off, I'm not going to say this film was terrible and anyone who disagrees with me is an idiot. We all have our own idiosyncrasies that colour how we view art and I respect other's views enough to know that nothing is categorical terrible (or brilliant) for every member of the audience.",
260,23 January 2023,arthur_tafero,5, Fight Club - An Entertaining Film for Teens,"This teen fantasy film is entertaining for the group it is intended for, but adults over 21 may find that the film lacks believability and substance. I love Ed Norton as a great actor, and even Brad Pitt is ok in some of his films, but should this film be in the top 250 films? Only if you live in a children's fantasyland. T
The dialogue is questionable, at best, but the idea is so enticing, we forget about reality for an hour or so. As if real life is not challenging enough, without going out and looking for trouble to make your life interesting. What a childish concept. However, teens might find this proposition much more likely, and would be receptive to any idea that might be a great deviation from the norm. The teen need to exert independence and gain a higher level of freedom overcomes their need to consider more realistic scenarios; they obviously prefer fantasy. Not that there's anything wrong with that, as Seinfeld would say. If you like the concept, enjoy the film.",
261,19 February 2011,Sylviastel,8, Ed Norton's Brilliant!,"I have to save that this film is entertaining to watch and can be seen multiple times. To me, the twist in the film wasn't a shock. This film is meant to be shocking and a revolution even in the minds of the general public. This film could be used to examine society where men get together and perform fights in order to prove themselves. The fight club becomes one man's obsession and way of life even leading to anarchy, destruction, and illegal activities trying to break away from the dread of life itself. The narrator played by Ed Norton is played brilliantly. He comes across as the average every guy in a dead end job, unhappy, miserable, and seeking a purpose in life by going to support groups for diseases and conditions that he doesn't have in life. It is Helena Bonham Carter's chain smoking character, Marla Singer, that comes into his life to further cause havoc and destruction. He needs reality of others but not another fake member like Singer in his groups to convey his need of belonging and self worth. I could go on but I think you get it. Brad Pitt does also a fine job in his role. The script has some holes in it but it's well done and entertaining.",
262,19 June 2011,kdnor2011,7, Is there some deep meaning I'm not getting?,"Before we start, I should tell you all that I have actually only seen this movie one, and that was around a year and a half ago, so I am mostly going on memory. Also there will be spoilers.",
