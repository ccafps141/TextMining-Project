0,28 April 2006,planktonrules,10, Chaplin's best--what a film!,"I've seen both version of this film--the original silent version from 1925 and the re-release by Chaplin in the 1940s. The difference is that the re-release was designed to appeal to a new audience that expected sound from their movies. To do this, title cards were removed--having Chaplin narrate the film. In addition, Chaplin-created music (for the most part--some were classical pieces), sound effects and singing were added to make the movie more palatable to the average viewer. I personally like BOTH versions and the one you watch is up to you if you get a copy of the Warner Brothers release on DVD--it has both plus excellent DVD extras. Otherwise, there have been a lot of public domain versions on video out there--many with terrible quality prints or music or both. The Warner version is the most pristine and beautiful silent print you can find. The version usually shown on Turner Classic movies is the 1942 re-release.",/
1,13 May 2005,lee_eisenberg,10, You just can't beat Charlie Chaplin!,"The 1898 Gold Rush to Alaska may have been harsh, but Charlie Chaplin makes it hilarious. As an unnamed prospector, Chaplin goes through a series of gaffes while seeking gold in the Yukon. Most famous of course are the shoe for dinner, the dancing roles, and the cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff. His companion, Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) at one point is so hungry that he believes Chaplin's character to be a chicken, and before long, a bear enters their cabin. In the midst of it all, the prospector falls in love with dancer Georgia (Georgia Hale).",r
2,15 May 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,10, Charlie Chaplin at his best.,"The Gold Rush is one of Chaplin's best films, as well as one of his most famous. It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by, and it's not hard to see why. Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector, a young miner during the gold rush. After getting caught in a storm, he hurries to the only shelter that he can find, a wood cabin in the middle of the storm. It turns out that it is already inhabited, and by a tough criminal named Black Larson, no less, and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim, another prospector, insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film.",e

6,4 January 2005,ACitizenCalledKane,10," Possibly Chaplin's best film, certainly one of the greatest comedies of all time!","To see Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush is to know enjoyment. One cannot help but enjoy a film as well-done as this! Chaplin said that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered, and I can see why. It is a masterful blend of comedy, drama, and romance, among other genres seamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture. Like all great movies, The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorable moments, from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rolls to the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain. All of these scenes are brilliant because of The Tramp's flawless physical comedy. He was a master of comedic timing, and he was one of the most graceful physical comedians I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong, this picture is not just three fantastic scenes amongst filler. The film moves along at a brisk pace, following the misadventures of our hero, The Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin, of course), as he attempts to hit it big by discovering gold in Alaska. Along his journey through the elements, the prospector meets the notorious Black Larsen (Tom Murray), a wanted criminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold. Fortunately, our friend also comes across a fellow prospector, Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain), who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich. But the Lone Prospector's adventures take place not only out in the middle of nowhere. When he is forced back to civilization, he falls in love with Georgia (Georgia Hale), the most beautiful girl in town. Of course, it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in this beauty. Jack Cameron (Malcolm Waite), the handsome lady's man who is not content with every other woman in town by his side; he must have Georgia, as well. Competition arises between the disappointed prospector and the ego-maniacal ""lady killer."" All of this would be too much for any one of us, but the Lone Prospector handles it all with his uncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bring us one of the greatest comedies of all time! I will not lie, I am a fan of Charlie Chaplin's movies, but as objective as I can possibly be, this IS one of the great movies...Essential viewing!",w
7,26 January 2002,lugonian,10, Charlie of the Yukon,"THE GOLD RUSH (United Artists, 1925), written, directed and starring Charlie Chaplin, may not be the very best of the Chaplin feature comedies of the silent era, but has become the very movie in which Chaplin wanted to be most noted for by future generations. So proud of his achievement, Chaplin reissued this silent film in 1942 with a new music soundtrack which introduced a narration written and spoken by Chaplin himself, eliminating the use of title cards. Then in the summer of 1971, THE GOLD RUSH became the initial movie presented on public broadcasting station's 13-week series of ""The Silent Years,"" as hosted by Orson Welles, from the Paul Killian collection with a new and excellent piano score by William Perry.",/
8,7 June 2004,PhilipJames1980,10, Gold is the operative word here.,"The Gold Rush is pure gold.  It was Charlie Chaplin's third feature-length film, and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris (1923), which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp.

Modern Times isn't, strictly speaking, a silent film, although Chaplin had no dialogue there.

12,15 February 2007,dataconflossmoor,10, Licorice Shoes and Critical Acclaim!!!!!,"Just like Orson Wells, Marlon Brando and Katherine Hepburn, Charlie Chaplin is a classic in the movie industry!! The king of silent films is attributed with making slapstick humor one of the stellar accomplishments in the entertainment business!! Slapstick comedy is predicated on a lot of physical humor, often times, slapstick is underrated in terms of the immense amount of talent it actually requires!! Lucille Ball got her start by emulating slapstick icons such as Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, and later, she instilled slapstick stunts in her renowned comedy series ""I Love Lucy""... The film, ""Gold Rush"" is hilarious in it's exaggeration of calamity!! Charlie Chaplin is tremendous in engaging in a befuddled demeanor about his basic struggle for survival!! ""Gold Rush"" was listed by one movie critic's list as the best film ever!! Why do you suppose this is? I would say that it is mostly on account of the cunningly successful aspects of silliness that are incorporated in the making of this movie!! Another big reason would be the flippant approach slapstick artist Charlie Chaplin orchestrates when encountering one predicament after the other in this film!! These actions are so overdone that they are hysterically funny!! Charlie Chaplin executes all of the necessary acrobatics of chicanery very effectively!! In the case of ""Gold Rush"" Charlie Chaplin is so intense in his ludicrous actions, that he effortlessly makes ""Gold Rush"" a masterpiece!! Take into account that it is 1925, before the film goer was barraged with a bevy of special effects, and you, (being part of the movie audience) will recognize how well put together this movie really is!! The innocuous charisma of a Nicklelodian style film is often times mollified, and is discarded by many people as being cavalier in it's attempt to attain a recognizable prowess as far as being an assertively marvelous flick is concerned!! Nothing could be further from the truth in the case of the film ""Gold Rush"" This film is outstanding!! The licorice shoes were an added whimsical element to making ""Gold Rush"" funny as well!! I strongly recommend that you rent this movie and watch it!! This is without a doubt, an extremely top notch film!! It is not always rated #1 on every critic's list, but, it is always listed as one of the best movies ever made by virtually every movie expert!! The latest review list that AFI came out with ""Gold Rush"" was rated 58th out of the top 100 American films ever made!!",1
13,11 March 2003,GTDMAC,10," Is It Better Than City Lights, though?","The eternal question for many Chaplin fans is is The Gold Rush better than City Lights?  There are some who would argue for Modern Times or maybe even The Great Dictator.  There are even a few who like Monsieur Verdoux.  But to say this film is better than City Lights is definitely inviting controversy. As a statement on social mores and values City Lights is far more indicting.  As an important piece of film City Lights shows us many things that had never been done before and perhaps may never be done again on the big screen.  But as a sheer enjoyable romp in The Little Tramp's world City Lights falls short.  It is buried in social commentary whereas the Gold Rush has some social issues to deal with but nothing much new from previous works until the end where it neatly summarizes what ""Charlot"" has been all about all along. It is that ending which makes the Gold Rush the best of Chaplin's works and the one I will watch just for the sheer joy of seeing the artist in his prime. 10 out of 10.",7

15,2 January 2022,nickenchuggets,10, Chaplin's best,"Charlie Chaplin was mostly known for his terrific silent films he made in the 1920s which were hugely popular with audiences. The one he himself said he wanted to be remembered for was The Gold Rush. It's technically a comedy, but its plot is much more complicated than most others in the genre. This doesn't mean it's bad in any way, it's just not what I was expecting from a film where the primary focus is to make people laugh. The story in this is centered around Chaplin's character, who doesn't have an actual name. He's a prospector during the gold rush that took place in Alaska at the end of the 1800s, and he is trying to make a huge sum of money very quickly. A snowstorm arrives, and in the confusion, he ends up in a cabin occupied by Black Larsen, a criminal. Jim (Mack Swain) also shows up in the cabin, and the three men reluctantly agree to live together (for now). Later, the cabin's food supply starts to diminish, so Larsen is sent outside to look for food. A bear strays into the cabin and is killed by Jim and the prospector, providing them with meat. Meanwhile, Larsen, still outside in the blizzard, finds a gold deposit and decides to use it as bait to lure Jim close enough so he can kill him. Larsen attacks Jim with a shovel and is knocked out, and Larsen is later killed by an avalanche. When Jim eventually wakes up, he wanders into a town, but can't actually remember where his gold deposit is. The prospector also shows up at this town and meets a girl named Georgia (Georgia Hale) at a dance hall, to whom he is instantly attracted. Georgia later goes to his house to eat dinner, but shortly after, Jim shows up to make the prospector guide him to the cabin. While Jim and the prospector are sleeping, a snowstorm blows half of the cabin precariously off a cliff, and it teeters back and forth dreadfully. Jim and the prospector manage to escape, and many months later, the prospector unexpededly encounters Georgia while on a boat back to America, and they're united again. Because this is (believe it or not) the 5th most profitable silent film ever, I had little doubt that it was going to be good. Not only that, but Chaplin is in it. Even almost a century later, there's an abundance of funny and fascinating things in this movie, such as when the cabin is about to fall off the cliff and they show the interior of it rotating. I wonder how they did that. There's also the scene where Jim is going insane with hunger and sees Chaplin's character as a giant chicken that he desperately wants to cook. I know it's a guy in a suit, but it's still funny. Films like this prove that physical comedy is something that will always be amusing, no matter how old it gets. I'm sure people many decades from now will still enjoy these timeless movies featuring one of the most iconic actors in history.",4
16,3 January 2009,pyrocitor,10, Peerless Chaplin masterpiece; comedic gold,"After an unsuccessful attempt at melodrama in A Woman in Paris, a conscious attempt to break away from the silly and simplistic entertainment of his early cinematic career and say something important as a serious artist, Charlie Chaplin was forced to return to just the sort of crowd pleasing comedy he had just unsuccessfully made a bid to deviate from. The crucial difference was, despite his return to his defining genre, Chaplin had not abandoned his newfound sense of cinematic grandeur or determination to accomplish something more worthwhile than throwaway entertainment through film. This rekindled cinematic ambition, combined with inspiration from a series of slides detailing a vast march of Klondike gold prospectors and a gruesome account of an expedition leading to cannibalism, led to The Gold Rush, a picture just as grand, vast and engaging as any of the dramas Chaplin might have initially wanted to emulate. However, it is through Chaplin's commitment to mining the most humane and heart-warming of comedy out of the most unlikely sources that the film is firmly cemented as an abiding classic of the era.

17,21 December 2007,Beta_Gallinger,8, A comedy still worth watching after over eighty years,"I never actually sat down to watch a silent movie from start to finish until earlier this year. Right now, I still haven't seen too many, but recently, for the first full-length silent comedy to see, I chose ""The Gold Rush"", a film written, directed by, and starring Charlie Chaplin, a highly renowned filmmaker of his time, as I was aware of this movie's wide appeal, as well as the wide appeal of much of Chaplin's other work. I wasn't as impressed with it as much as many others have been, but all in all, it was a good experience.",/

The scene when the two fight with the rifle pointed to Chaplin, the scene when they eat the boot, then when the big guy thinks that Chaplin it's a chicken, when Chaplin is burying the rifle in the snow, then the dance scene when Chaplin's pants fall off, followed
by the dog which is tied to the end of the rope with which Chaplin tightens his pants, and more, all are scenes of reference in the history of world cinema, scenes that inspired many other filmmakers from then until today. And they
certainly will inspire and from now on. Georgia Hale was very beautiful!",?

When I first saw the genres of this movie I was not looking forward to it at all. It was the first silent movie I was seeing and also the oldest. It had originally seemed like everything I didn't look for in a ""good"" movie. At the conclusion of this movie I knew that my original thought process was entirely wrong. This movie has certainly changed my view on both silent and older films, especially on a comedic standpoint. There was so much about it that was appealing to the viewer. I recommend this movie to all looking to expand their film genres of interest.",e
21,27 June 2001,caspian1978,9, The American comic tradition,"Make them laugh, make them laugh. The American comic tradition and American movies were made for each other. Gold Rush is one example that Charlie Chaplin was the father of American comedy. Even though Chaplin loves to press political, economical, or social messages in his films, The Gold Rush remains true to its genre. It is a comedy non the less. Even at the end of the film when THE TRAMP receives a kiss, Chaplin reminds the audience that she has ruined the picture with the kiss. This is suppose to be a comedy!",f
22,15 June 2005,ffinixs,10, One of the Greatest Silent Comedies,"What a delightful film. I can see the imagination bursting on the screen in riches. Each scene contains surprises and bits of magic. I love how the film shows visually that the liquid is alcohol and how the cabin ended up on the edge of a cliff. This masterpiece is not just a comedy but there are parts that make me laugh just thinking about them, like the eating shoe scene, fighting over rifle while Chaplin tries to hide from gun, and when the cabin is tipping over the cliff scene. When the Lone Prospector finds Georgia the film unveils some truly touching dramatic moments. I love the image of Chaplin standing still outside his open door listening to the crowd on New Year's Eve knowing that he was stood-up. I genuinely felt for him. Chaplin is a auteur who can make me laugh and cry at the same time. Brilliant.",_
23,13 September 2010,d-jacobs1,6," Fun, full of feeling, and enjoyable. A good show of Chaplin's range","The Gold Rush is a showcase of sorts for Chaplin. In it, he provides audiences with a wide range of cinematic elements from his signature slapstick routines to dramatic relationships. The rags to riches plot was interesting and witty, but felt dragged out. While Chaplin is good at emotionally engaging the audience with relate-able situations, like getting stood up or competing for a woman, the lack of serious conflict makes the film seem simple. The special effects were handled nicely even by todays standards, but the true enjoyment in the film comes from watching the tramp endure hardship as he accidentally progresses into wealthiness, and sees his life fall together by favorable coincidence.",=

26,19 October 2005,Zzx1988,9, A masterpiece of early cinema....,"In Charles Chaplin's 1925 film, ""The Gold Rush"", a lone prospector travels to California looking for gold, and entwines himself in adventures and finds Georgia, the woman of his dreams. After many hardships, including a relocating cabin, the lone prospector, played by Charles Chaplin, finds gold and becomes rich, ending in success and unity with Georgia. The time period in which this movie was shot, compared with the technological innovation and the state of the art filming techniques, give this film an undoubted masterpiece feel. The use of up-close shots combined with comedic imagery also brought a new feel to the style of silent cinema. The scene with the cabin shifting, and the camera tilting to reflect the inner cabin, was one of the many stylistic filming techniques that gave ""The Gold Rush"" such artistic and ingenious appeal. Chaplin's ideas and his vision that he brought to life in the movie ""The Gold Rush"" make it a great landmark in the beginning of silent films and in film history. The intricate but simple story of ""The Gold Rush"" brought about many distinct feelings when viewing. It gives feelings of happiness, during scenes where there is comedic relief and slapstick comedy, and also can bring about sadness or pity for the lone prospector when he waits for Georgia on New Year's but she never shows up. It reveals how silent films can become in touch with a person's feelings, making them feel for the protagonist, without having to have dialogue to explain the gestures and plot. These aspects of ""The Gold Rush"" make it a milestone in the film industry of the modern world.",_

What is it exactly that's so sad about Chaplin, given the fact that he's always doing something zany and laugh out loud funny? It's that he always seems to be an outsider; he never quite fits in. There's always someone bigger, stronger, richer, better looking than him. And I think that's what movie audiences responded to during his hey-day and what they're still responding to now.",r

It's a mute movie, after all. I'm really glad that I watched the newer version, where all the text boards were removed and replaced with a narrator. Fortunately, this made the movie a bit shorter. The movie consists of two almost separated plots who are tied together at the end of the movie. Both plots are somewhat interesting, but personally I liked the ""wilderness/cabin/gold digger-plot"" (the first part of the movie) much better. The ending is fortunately quite good in this movie.",

The first half of the movie reunites Chaplin, another lonesome gold seeker, and a moral-less scoundrel in a shelter, under a particularly horrendous snowstorm. There happens one of the most memorable scene of the movie: Big Jim's delusion that Chaplin's is a giant (of course bearing Chaplin's manners) chicken, and his desperate attempts to eat him; but Chaplin is saved by a bear showing up which they finally eat. Then, parting their ways, begins the second half of the movie: the one-sided romance with the beautiful Georgia, met in a dance hall. How funny was the scene when she invited out of despair our little fellow to dance to avoid dancing with an invading Jake! How genius showed Chaplin to use Tchaykovsky's...Beauy & the Beast's waltz! Bringing to tear and laughters at the same time. As Georgia plays nastily and mocks and fools Chaplin, with her friends, and secretly discovers his love, her heart swings. But Chaplin is taken away by his former colleague, Big Jim, to ""become millionaires"" (i.e. find gold). And they find it! All ends well as the little fellow & big Jim, now millionaires, leave on a ship.

39,15 September 2017,sol-,7, Cabin Fever,"Improperly prepared for Klondike's harsh weather conditions, a lone gold prospector has to share a cabin with another prospector, whose hunger often drives him insane, in this Charles Chaplin silent comedy. Proclaimed by Chaplin as the film by which he most wanted to be remembered, 'The Gold Rush' has gone onto much acclaim, but those expecting the charm of 'City Lights' and imaginative sets and situations of 'Modern Times' may be disappointed. To be fair, 'The Gold Rush' starts off quite well with lots of humorous situations at the outskirts cabin, including imagined chickens, persons blown in and out of doorways and a hilarious sequence in which Chaplin keeps trying to dodge a gun barrel during a fight, only to find the gun pointed in his face wherever he goes. Around a third of the way in though, Chaplin leaves the cabin and what follows is far less innovative as he becomes the subject of tricks and falls in love upon returning to town. There are some funny town sequences for sure (dancing with a dog leash) and there is a great bit involving a tilting cabin near the end, but the final two thirds of the film never recapture the magic of the first third. With so many jokes and ideas that have since been imitated (bread roll forks), this is an undeniably iconic comedy, but those keen on seeing Chaplin at his finest may wish to look elsewhere.",

A feat that's quite elaborate and full of effort for the time. Like all Cjaplin movies, The Gold Rush depicts his signature character The Tramp, although here he was named the Lone Prospector. I like how the movie depicts the poor man rising up to betterment of his life, an image that many can relate at the time. Chaplin's story telling also comes out as he did all the narratives himself in this movie. The other cast did quite okay here. Georgia Hall nicely complete the angles for this movie.",

Chaplin did an about face from his previous film with The Gold Rush, realizing the public would not accept serious drama with his name attached to it. Instead, he returned to the little tramp character and his tried and true formula of an everyman at odds with the world around him. Although, in this film he seamlessly combines comedy and drama, as he did in The Kid. It was his first film with a prepared script before shooting began. As with The Kid, it was also another film beset with personal turmoil. Lita Grey, who eventually became Chaplin's second wife, became pregnant after being selected as the female lead in the film. As a result, Georgia Hale, Grey's friend at the time, was selected instead. Filming was delayed considerably, but the film was finally released in the summer of 1925 to instant fanfare. ",

""The Gold Rush"" at first started to think that Chaplin's character is very dumb and unlucky, and also has an unusual comedy humorous irony effect. I had to keep searching and fighting with each other, but also to fight against the bad weather and snow mountains at any time. Being accidentally besieged in the snow mountain hut, and competing with the big bear for food, the plot of one door in one door was arranged by Chaplin very interesting. When there was no food to eat, Chaplin began to think of leather shoes, eating leather shoe laces as noodles, untiring leather shoes and nailing them to eat noodle cakes, eating with relish. Finally, the snow stopped, Chaplin came down the mountain to find food, but found the girl who was happy, but had no money, and had to eat some food to continue to go up the mountain to make gold, and had such a sweet dream. It happened to meet the kind owner, who had sufficient supplies, and went far away to trust him to keep his butler, and just saw the girl who came down the mountain. Chaplin even had the illusion of love, no matter whether the girls were just jokes, at Christmas On the night of the festival, a simple but generous dinner is arranged. Simple is for girls, and rich is for gold prospectors. So there is a classic scene, Chaplin hasn't waited for the beloved, he is looking for fun to pass the boredom. He used two forks to fork a piece of bread, such as human legs and feet, jumping a kind of interesting The dance seemed so vivid, as if there were dancers who went on stage after rehearsing. Unfortunately, the girl didn't come until the night, and even more unfortunately, the avalanche on the mountain and the competition in the house. Fortunately, it was not Chaplin who fell with the crumbling house on the cliff. His life was saved, and his wealth also gained.

The Gold Rush, directed by and starring Chaplin, is a wonderfully captivating historical comedy about a lone gold rush prospector. The story is set in the Colorado Rockies during the Gold Rush. It was originally made without music or dialog during the silent film era, in 1925. It was an instant hit and became a success all over the world. In 1942, Chaplin had the idea remake the movie with sound and narration and to release the new version to a public that was now used to films with soundtracks. The release of the new Gold Rush followed the box office flop of his previous film, The Great Dictator, and Chaplin desperately needed something to pick up his career. The Gold Rush was just what he needed and has remained a much-loved classic to this day. The film is both touching and funny at the same time. Chaplin's character is quirky and sympathetic.",

I haven't seen many silent films until recently, and I must say that I adore Charlie Champlin's work. I never thought I could laugh so hard at a silent film, but I surprisingly couldn't stop smiling and giggling. The Goldrush was entertaining from beginning to end. When all three men were stuck in the cabin together, I honestly thought one of them was going to die in order for the other two to survive off of the one. They eventually draw cards to see who draws the lowest card, and that person had to go out and hunt for food. The tramp got lucky, he drew a low card but fortunately for him the other guy drew the lowest. I thought it was crazy when the Tramp boiled the leather shoe, it just shows you how starving they really were! Both men started going crazy from not eating, especially when one imagined the other as chicken, the chicken suit Charlie wore was great. My favorite part of the movie was when they were both sleeping and the Tramp wakes up to find the cabin moving all around, but he thinks it's in his head. Then both men move from side to side balancing it out perfectly each time before they catch on that half of the cabin was hanging off the edge of the cliff! There were many moments in the movie that I found myself hysterically laughing! I'm glad I watched the Goldrush, it just shows you how clever and funny movies were back in the 1920s. It gives you a chance to connect with the past. Even though it was 90 years ago, there were many scenes that you could relate to and identify with.",
77,29 December 2019,Horst_In_Translation,6," Sometimes funny, but overall not one of His best","""The Gold Rush"" is an American black-and-white silent film from 1925, so this one gets closer and closer to its 100th anniversary now. It runs for over 1.5 hours in the original, but there are several versions out there and the version i saw last night was around the 80-minute mark I believe. And it was not really a silent film, not because of the music and soundtrack, but because of the narration. It was unusual to me. We had a narrator who basically told us exactly what the characters were saying in the sense of a voice-over. It felt unusual to me because it was really an audio commentary basically and I have seen a lot from Chaplin, but this I have never come across. I think it is him of course who does the job too. It felt especially strange when he was on two or three occasions saying what the central female character was saying. And yes there was a soundtrack of course. I recently found out that Chaplin wants his movies only shown with his original soundtrack and I can understand why really, even if it always not too easy for me to appreciate how there is really permanent soundtrack from beginning to end in a movie, something that is really unthinkable today. But this did not bother me as much as the narration. I definitely would have preferred intertitles. Anyway, now about the film it was nominated for two Oscars in the audio categories, but not too surprising because it was going against 11 and even 17 contenders for these awards, a lot more nominees than we have today. And Chaplin as neither of the nominees, even if once again this is really his movie once again.",

As one of his earliest feature films, I think ""The Gold Rush"" set a respectable standard on which to build a reputation, however I enjoyed his later films a lot more. For me, 1931's ""City Lights' is the gauge to measure other Chaplin pictures by, if not the entire genre of silent film. Similarly, I found 1936's ""Modern Times"" and 1940's ""The Great Dictator"" to be more provocative and insightful, which tells me that as Chaplin grew as a film maker, he found more compelling themes to portray and did it with informed maturity and insight.",

The story is so simple that anyone can follow it and enjoy it, from 5-500, and it's ideas have been copied numerous times. I've seen this maybe 5 times now, and, although I've grown to like other silent comedians better, it was a pleasure to see this again. My only other comment, and this is not a complaint but rather an awkward aside. The version I saw quite recently was the 1942 version which is the feature version on the new DVD edition of the film. In this version, instead of inter titles, there's audio commentary. This was all done by Chaplin. While it's fun to listen to (Chaplin seems to be having a ball doing this). I really wonder why this needed to be done, and not just let the original stand on it's own merits. I guess silents were so out of vogue that when it was being re-released Chaplin did this to try to broaden the audience? That would be my guess.",
81,4 October 2010,jboothmillard,10, The Gold Rush,"To my knowledge, this is the most acclaimed and well loved of all the films starring Sir Charlie Chaplin, and featuring in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I wasn't going to miss it. Basically a lone prospector, or Tramp (Chaplin, also directing) is in the Alaskan mountains looking for gold, but a blizzard takes him to the shelter of a remote cabin. Also in the cabin staying out of the bad weather is gold searching Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain), as well as wanted escaped criminal Black Larsen (Tom Murray). While the criminal leaves the cabin to take the stash of gold, only to meet his fate falling off the cliff, the Tramp and Big Jim stay in the cabin while the wind and snow is still raging. Hunger is beginning to take over, and the Tramp at one point resorts to eating one of his own shoes, leather like meat and laces like spaghetti. Big Jim meanwhile is hallucinating, like the Tramp as a large chicken he is very keen to eat, but he realises he is seeing things. After the blizzard blows the shack to the edge of a cliff and the Tramp and Big Jim escape falling down with it, and of course the weather has calmed down, they travel to the nearest town. Giving up being a prospector for another job, the Tramp sees and has feelings for lonely saloon girl Georgia (Georgia Hale), but he is mistaken into thinking she loves him. The Tramp tries to get the attentions of Georgia in front of her teasing friends, with acts such as sticking forks in bread rolls and making them dance like legs. Big Jim has turned up in town suffering amnesia, he only remembers the Tramp, and he needs his help finding the stash of gold left in the mountains. Of course in the end, they do find the gold and become better dressed millionaire partners, and the Tramp helps out Georgia who has resorted to being a stowaway on boats to get around. In the end, Georgia believes he has always been a Tramp not realising the recent change in his life, but it doesn't matter, she does truly have feelings for him, and it is a happy ending. Also starring Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis and Malcolm Waite as Jack Cameron. The two most memorable sequences are of course the eating the shoe, and dancing bread rolls, and Chaplin is the perfect character to pull them off. There is a version with Chaplin narrating for dialogue and stuff, sounds effects help too, Chaplin is charming and fun, and the slapstick jokes are simple but plentiful, it is certainly the best Chaplin film I know, a must see silent comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Music for Max Terr and Best Sound. Sir Charlie Chaplin was number 50 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 24 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, he was number 38 on The World's Greatest Actor, and he was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Films, it was number 74 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 58 on 100 Years, 100 Greatest Movies, and it was number 25 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs.

91,13 July 2015,anaconda-40658,9, Chaplin's Snowbound Comedy.,"The Gold Rush (1925): Dir: Charlie Chaplin / Cast: Charlie Chaplin, Georgina Hale, Mack Swain, Tom Murray, Malcolm Waite: Prosperity comedy with trademark tramp venturing into the Yukon and interrupted by gold digger Big Jim McKay and convict Black Larson. He enters a community and encounters a young woman at a new years eve party. Memorable scenes involve a boiled boot, the dancing buns, and a cabin teetering on a cliff. Ripe with ideas as Chaplin was ahead of his time visually and with impressive sight jokes. As the Tramp Chaplin stumbles through life making the best of his limitations. Georgina Hale plays the love interest harassed by the town's ladies man. She takes interest in Chaplin when trying to avoid her ego driven boyfriend but feels regret when she forgot about Chaplin's new years party. Mack Swain plays the amnesia driven McKay who struck gold before being confronted by Larson. He will enlist in the Tramp's help in relocating it. Tom Murray plays Larson who is wanted by the law but finds refuge in a cabin with Chaplin and McKay until greed takes over. He will eventually take a sudden wrong turn. Malcolm Waite provides great amusement as Hale's egotistical boyfriend who takes a dislike to Chaplin. An impressive film by a director with no limits. While the constant music is off putting, this is still an astounding visual moments and a truly innovative take on prosperity. Score: 9 / 10",
92,1 February 2021,ctcpolo,10, The Gold rush,"Charlie Chaplins silent film The Gold rush has incredibly expressive acting, with minimal text, and a diversity of settings. After he weathers his first snow storm and ends up with two men in a cabin, things get tense. His body language and expressions almost make up for the lack of sound, and he is able to communicate with just his acting alone. There are a variety of different settings, the main ones being the cabin, the dance hall, and outdoors. Chaplin switches between these settings, regularly so they are never in one setting for too long. The music is also goes along with the actions, and because its silent, its magnified and I noticed it more than I usually would. Overall I really enjoyed the movie, and was impressed by the acting, and how entertaining it was.",
93,16 April 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," A film of two halves with a secretly downbeat ending, this is still an endearing and visually arresting Chaplin classic.","'The Gold Rush (1925)' does very much feel like a film of two halves, though these differing segments do converge and realign somewhat towards its final movement. It's the fact that the more romantic aspects are essentially less interesting and exciting than the other more visually arresting and comically enchanting moments that prevents the piece from ascending past Chaplin's other most famous efforts. Yet the picture, of which I viewed a restored version that essentially recreates the initial 1925 release, has aged remarkably well and is as charming as you'd expect, managing to maintain a clear and consistent level of visual storytelling and some superb set-pieces that are as amusing as they are impressive. It's just a shame that the flick's final note is actually a secretly, and most likely unwittingly, downbeat one. 7/10",

Here The Tramp is in the Klondike during the gold rush in the 1890's, and while he hardly looks or acts like a prospector, we identify with him as he endures hardship, befriends 'Big Jim' (Mack Swain), survives close quarters with the murderous Black Larsen (Tom Murray), falls for a woman who toys with him (Georgia Hale), and puts up with her bullying boyfriend (Malcolm Waite).

95,10 June 2016,Horror-yo,8, Fun little ride with lots of humanity,"Another classic Chaplin. As usual, and interestingly, although the story and plot are finely coherent, it could be said this film represents more a cluster of morals with each part conveying a particular sense and meaning, rather than how films classically supply one big singular morality at the end. Chaplin's films, though again certainly coherent and finely constructed, have that quality reminiscent of sketches; separate parts that work together as an ensemble; which only works in generating more entertainment for the viewer as he's given a wider palette of thought, visuals and humor. In this one Chaplin showcases his unique ability to make a scene out of nothing, create value out of very little going on, and if ever you'd find it unfunny it is at very least certainly very creative. I'd imagine everybody would laugh wholeheartedly at least once during this. Finally, as always with Chaplin, ultimately this is a tale of humanity, and one that highlights the endearing fact of the 'little guy', the oddball; so unlikely to succeed or fit in anywhere, who yet manages a whole lot more than any of that.",

108,20 March 2021,briancham1994,6," Excellent visual storytelling, clumsy voice acting","I watched the 1942 version of this film with the voice acting and I must say it's a very clumsy experience to watch. The characters all seem to have the same voice and just express things that are very obvious or don't need to be repeated. On the other hand, the narration does sometimes clarify the action on the screen, which just emphasises how unclear it was originally. An example would be near the end when the ship's captain is informed that Charlie Chaplin's character is not a stowaway. If not for the narration, it would just seem like a strange conflict was instigated and then suddenly averted for no clear reason. This makes me doubt the skill of the visual storytelling here - while Charlie Chaplin is generally a master of using only props and expressions to communicate the situation, and this film is full of that skill, there are clearly lapses at times. Other than these misgivings, The Gold Rush has memorable characters, a solid storyline, passionate emotions and intense set pieces - the bear (which used a real bear in production) and the cliff being the stand-outs to me.",

Although it's only one relatively short sequence in the movie, the scene in the cabin with The Lone Prospector (Chaplin) and his two burly companions is by far my favorite. It's HERE that the allusion to the Donner party comes in, as the three men face starvation in the little one-room cabin. At one point, The Prospector becomes convinced that one of his companions has eaten their dog, but, fortunately, this turns out not to be the case. The high point is the scene where The Prospector cooks and eats one of his shoes (which he shares with one of the two others, the third man already having moved on). It's a famous scene, and it's STILL funny: Chaplin wounds a shoestring around his fork like a string of spaghetti and munches it almost happily. And Chaplin, dressed in a chicken suit (which is how his starving companion sees him), accurately mimics the mannerisms of a real chicken (until he's forced to grab a shotgun for self-preservation). It's interesting that the ""dancing buns"" sequence, wherein Chaplin skewers a pair of rolls and proceeds to put on a tabletop floor show for onlookers, turns out to have been nothing but a dream: it goes to the heart of the despair that always seemed to somehow suffuse Chaplin's best films.

Oddly enough, some of the best gags are built around some truly awful circumstances: starvation in a snowbound mountain cabin (shades of the Donner party), and the tramp's frustrated love for a beautiful but sometimes brutally insensitive dance hall girl, played by Georgia Hale with atypically headstrong independence for a Chaplin film (he usually favored more passive Victorian ingénues). The familiar Chaplin pathos rears it's head in several scenes, and the expected climax is missing (the cabin teetering on the edge of the cliff is an unconvincing model; Buster Keaton would have done it for real), but this is the comedy Chaplin hoped to be remembered by, and for good reason: his 'Little Fellow' was never more dignified, playful, optimistic, or resourceful.

I know that silent films is where are cinema history began, but i have to say i find them utterly boring.I was honestly bored and found myself drifting away from the movie, it just didn't hold my attention. At least Chaplin comedy can be fabulously expressed even without words. For example there's a scene where their so hungry there imaging a chicken and chasing each other around. The scene could be funny even if taken out of context. There's also a scene where hes shoveling snow, but not realizing that hes making an even bigger pile out of what hes shoveling. I found myself laughing quite a bit during that scene. The scenes do seem a little bit over done at times though.The movie is about just what is sounds like, Chaplin finds him self searching for gold,and comedy ensues. The props for The Gold Rush were noticeable bad, very fake. For example there's the cabin scenes. Everything just looks like a set, especially when the cabin is about to slide off the side of the mountain, the scenes/effects(all the back and forth motion) is not very authentic.

133,6 May 2022,garethcrook,7, Chaplin proving The Kid wasn't a fluke.,"I'm having a bit of a Chaplin season, this following on from The Kid. It makes sense to watch these films back to back. To slip a modern film in between would be a bit jarring and I'm enjoying having my cinematic sensibilities reset by Chaplin's silent era vision. His appearance here is much quicker than in The Kid. He's now a star. Here he's The Lone Prospector, although to all intents and purposes he's still The Tramp. He's a character we're designed to feel for, as he struggles in the snowy wilderness, looking for gold in the earth, shelter from the harsh winter weather and safety from the more suitably dressed outdoorsmen whom share the screen with him. It's certainly dramatic with gunfights, the threat of starvation and Big Jim (Mack Swain) deliriously imagining that our hero is a giant tasty chicken. Daft as that sounds, it's pretty violent really. That is until our hero prospector meets Georgia (Georgia Hale) at a dancehall in the new mining town and falls in love. Sadly Georgia isn't as sweet and innocent as the doe eyed prospector. It doesn't quite have the well rounded plot of The Kid, but it is still very good and it does have the famous bread roll dance. That now given its fame, seems almost incidental in the storyline. Despite being the downtrodden character, the prospector is the nicest man in the room and with any luck, soon to be the richest. Maybe it's that The Kid set the bar so high, but this feels a bit lacking in comparison. There's a whole subplot with the wanted Black Larsen (Tom Murray) that essentially gets forgotten about and as it nears its finale, everything feels a little rushed, like they're running out of film. It's still charming though. Next up: City Lights.",

If anything, the 1942 version is TOO MUCH Chaplin, as his narration seems too snide to evoke the same amount of empathy for a protagonist the narrator almost-derisively calls ""the little fellow"" (a term NEVER used on a 1925 GOLD RUSH title card).

136,23 December 2012,barryrd,9, An excellent example of a lost genre,"The Gold Rush, made in 1925, is a silent movie with a series of hilarious and bittersweet skits that are so well acted and so hard to stop watching that I was left with the feeling that I had seen one of the great classics. Charlie Chaplin is the creator of this movie, as leading actor, director and writer. The movie does what a silent movie should and that is, it left me with a visual experience quite unlike other movies I am used to seeing. In the movie, Chaplin is partnered with a character named Jim MacKay (Mack Swain)whose size and persona are the opposite of Chaplin. The dinner scene with the boots as the meal was so imaginative and realistic, that one could imagine him devouring a delectable meal. Later a cliffhanging scene shows the two of them running back and forth across a one room cabin as it teeters on the edge of a cliff. The romance with a girl named Georgia (Georgia Hale) is heartwarming and very innocent by today's standards. In one dance scene, the viewer sees the two of them as one embarrassing incident followed another with the floor filled with other dance partners oblivious to the whole scene. Another time he entertains a group of young ladies and uses two buns and forks to simulate a dance routine.

The Tramp goes off to the Gold Rush and grapples with bears, extreme winds and cold, hunger, and love for a dilettante woman. The contrast between the diminutive tramp and the two huge brutes he shares his cabin with is the constant sight conceit. It plays out wonderfully in the cliff-edge cabin scene. It enhances the boot-cooking scene and the hallucination of Tramp as chicken. The film also has heart that transcends the sentimentalism that preyed on the cinema of its times - the Tramp is made to work for his maiden's hand, and her humiliation of him on New Year's Eve is poignant and painful.

The only snag I have with this movie is its sudden end about Chaplin's love interest for Georgia, and Georgia has not convinced me. The impression she gave me was that she did not love him but rather felt sorry for him, which at least is already a step in becoming more human, and when finding that he became millionaire she seemed only more relieved (financially) than properly happy - unless both money and happiness are the same to her.

167,14 January 2015,JosephPezzuto,8, Reel Look: 'The Gold Rush',"""But I'll dance the Oceana Roll!"" In Chaplin's 1925 silent comedy classic 'The Gold Rush', the Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin) is faced with a whole slew of hardships and challenges, such as biting, blistering winds, near starvation and leaping out of a cabin right before it plummets off of a cliff! And all for the sake of seeking fame and fortune, respectively. To upset matters worse, his ill-gotten attire market him as the mockery for the buffoonery of his comrades and the ruthless rigors of the frigid trek northward. However, real prospectors of the late nineteenth century as part of the Klondike Gold rush faced somewhat similar predicaments. Some came from many walks of life, some as far as the United Kingdom, South Africa and Australia. Most were perfectly aware that the chances of finding significant amounts of gold were very slim and just went along for the adventure, despite what hardships they might face, even through if it meant trenching up the discouraging but enduring Chilkoot Pass in the hopes of gaining their own individual fortunes. Prospectors had to build rafts and boats that would take them the final five-hundred plus miles down the Yukon to Dawson City, near the gold fields. Also, they had to carry a year's supply of goods over the passes to be allowed to enter Canada. About a ton, more than half of it, was food. Regarding history, I believe that some of it matches what 'The Gold Rush' portrays in the film. During the picture in the beginning, many men were carrying goods on their backs or pulling them on sleds, just like during the real Klondike expedition. However, do the prospectors that endure the frigid winds and blinding snow in a vain search for valuable, shiny nuggets depict the accuracy of what occurred in real life back then? Let's take a look.",

The Gold Rush was a box office hit currently still being the 5th highest grossing silent film in cinema history. Certain points in the plot of the film confused me but the general idea was visible. The movie is about a man on a pursuit for wealth. He ends up discovering more than he was searching for after making a few friends along the way. Charlie Chaplin plays a very comical character that makes the movie easy to/fun to watch. the movie covers all of the human emotions and feelings.

173,24 January 2015,Patti-Gaston,8, Heartwarming & Funny,"Another classic by the great Charlie Chaplin! Gold Rush includes everything from Chaplin's classic humor, danger, murder, love and a very happy ending that I didn't think was going to happen. Charlie stars again as the Tramp and finds himself in Alaska to prospect for gold and along the way he finds himself in a variety of situations and he meets a lot of characters along the way. Regardless of the situation, the Tramp always manages to stay true to himself and his ideals and Chaplin's characters always stand up for themselves and for the leading lady, in this film her name is Georgia. Despite the dangers that the Alaskan frontier poses, from bears to storms to murderers and falling cabins, Chaplin always manages to bring his unique laugh out loud humor to nearly every scene. At the end of the movie when Big Jim and the Tramp sail home as millionaires and the Tramp was asked to dress up in his prospecting clothes for a photo shoot I thought for sure the authorities were going to arrest him as a stowaway but happily he wasn't and he even reunited with Georgia. The last scene with the two of them kissing was so touching it made me think that maybe Chaplin had an affair with the actress in real life. I hope so because they looked great together. Also impressive is the scenery and the special effects. I loved the storms which seemed very real and the snow covered mountains which could be an image even today's sophisticated person would associate with Alaska. A well done and enjoyable film, I would recommend to everyone.",

The cabin, the clothing, the town, everything really helped to set the mood that they were actually there. The effect when the house is hanging off the mountain actually seemed real! Whenever there was too much weight on the side of the house which was over the cliff, the house would actually tip, with all of the items inside it sliding. This seems very good effects for the '20s. I also enjoyed the effects when Charlie Chaplin's character faded in and out from being a chicken, to the tramp.",

Chaplin's performance as ""The Lone Prospector"" isn't just funny, but endearing and personal as well. It's clear that a lot of soul was put into the performance. The scene where Chaplin anticipates Georgia(Georgia Hale) and her crew's arrival on New Year's Eve, for instance, is both funny and deeply sentimental. Chaplin has the charm and presence of a cartoon character. Nintendo's ""Super Mario"" comes to mind(who was undoubtedly(at least indirectly)influenced by Chaplin's Little Tramp character). About 25 minutes through the film, Chaplin's character makes himself a ridiculous looking new boot(after eating his old one), and it remains with for the rest of the movie. It's very humorous, and it's just one of the subtle charms of the character(and the movie). Mack Swain as Big Jim Mckay is hilarious as well. Him and Chaplin are great together.",

However, the movie actually had a very coherent and entertaining plot. Charlie's acting was phenomenal in my opinion. His facial expressions and demeanor were really effective. Also, just the way he moved and his behavior were hilarious. I also thought all of the gags and physical comedy in the movie were great. While watching it I noticed that a lot of the jokes were predictable to me because I've seen similar things in so many other films.

Honestly, I had my apprehensions at first. I thought that a silent film wouldn't be too exciting, however, I had never really seen an entire film of this sort. The Gold Rush was confusing for me at first, I didn't understand what was going on when the scenes switched from being in the middle of nowhere, to being in a small town. Other than that, I appreciated the fact the Charlie Chaplin was so innovative, and his camera skills were impressive for the 1920's. The acting was humorous and understandable. It was surprisingly easy for me to relate to the characters because of their exaggerated facial expressions and body language. The only part of the film I did not like was when the house was falling of the cliff, it was a little too obvious that it wasn't real, but then again there weren't the same technological advances then as there are now. Overall, The Gold Rush was a great silent film for my first experience.",

I had heard of Charlie Chaplin in my travels but never could truly understand what the craze was about until i saw him in action for the first time. His Ability to capture the audience in a spell of wonder, excitement, and laughter is nothing short of amazing, considering its release date and the fact that it is a silent film. Chaplin is an artist, and entertaining an audience is simply his canvas. His over-exaggerated gestures, facial features, and appearance all add to the magic of his character. The movie itself didn't so much stand out to me, I knew it was about a Gold Rush but, I was more interested in Chaplins performance and his interactions with other actresses and actors of that time period. The film itself held pleasing visuals, once again, considering that it was 1925. All in all the film was delightful, it was my first silent film and was enjoyable. Just imagine if some of todays blockbusters were dubbed silent, most of the ""actors"" wouldn't be able to hold the shortened attention span of the present day audiences for more than thirty seconds!",

The film keeps the viewer entertained and it's hard to find a boring part although some points are rather repetitive.

181,1 October 2018,jackfull,10, Good Old Original Humor and Story!,"Living in an age where the norm in cinema is heavy action, verbal comedy, and almost all the visuals are done with special effects, Charlie Chaplin's Gold Rush is something I watched out of boredom and did not expect to be as good as it is. It is one of the few films out there that received a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. It was a film released in 1925, originally silent, then later music and a voice over was added and it was re released in 1942. It does not matter which version you watch, although I suggest that if you want a more immersive experience, the 1942 version is the way to go. In its original release alone, it pulled $1 million dollars into United Artists, and $2 million to Chaplin. This was in 1926!
Getting into the nitty-gritty of this film, this is some of Chaplin's best work in my opinion. Although the story is basic and scenes are easily predictable, it is still a great laugh to watch. This film has some great examples of how Chaplin liked to direct and make his films.He takes a basic scenario where we as the viewer think we know exactly what will happen. ""Oh his pants are falling so he'll take that rope he eyed on the table and tie it around his waist."" This is the first step of reality. Then in typical Chaplin fashion, he flip reality on us. ""He's used the rope to hold up his pants, but its the leash to a dog!"" That's how most if not all of Chaplin's jokes work. Camera angle also plays into effect here. We only see the rope on the table Chaplin wants to use. But what we can't see from this angle is the dog laying on the floor, tied to the rope. This how the majority of the jokes play out in this movie and although it is a bit old school to do it this way, it makes the movie great!
The characters and story in this film are also fantastic! You have the prospector (Charlie Chaplin), the disposable bad guy(Tom Murray), the friend(Mack Swain), the love interest(Georgia Hale), and the cocky ladies man(Malcom Waite). Like I said before, the story is at its root pretty basic,(boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back) but its the jokes and how the story is played out that makes this so enjoyable. 
Closing up, this film is not only a great work of Chaplin, but of cinema. Chaplin some years later had said that this was the film he wanted to be remembered for. The filming is good, the characters, the visuals, the story. Its all a hilarious classic adventure. Definitely watch this if you have time, it will be time well spent.",
182,1 February 2021,TabithaNoel,8, Charlie Chaplin's Best,"I would recommend this movie for a first-time silent movie viewer like myself. Charlie Chaplin is a legend when it comes to silent movies. Him and the actors and actresses in this film are spectacular in showing emotion such as sadness, happiness, and going a little bit insane since no words are said in the actual film. I enjoyed the comedy in this film; it was simple yet affective to put a smile on my face at some points and it kind of reminded me of ""The Three Stooges"" at one point. The music did a great job in expression as well when there was a fight, a sad moment, a happy moment, or a moment that is supposed to be a little silly. I also like how they included folk songs such as ""Loch Lomond"" in the middle of the film and ""Auld Lang Syne"" in the dance hall scene on New Year's Eve. All in all, this was a great movie and I would highly recommend it to a person who may want to see a silent movie.",
183,2 May 2012,bbrooks94,10, One of Chaplin's finest,"Chaplin's biggest, most well known film (includes his most famous routine, the 'bread rolls dance' along with a handful of others, including my favourite, the boot gourmet dinner, which is made significantly more entertaining thanks to Chaplin's facial quirks and subtle comic timing) and the one he wanted to be remembered for, remains one of the greatest films ever made (although not his best, believe it or not! The man truly was a genius). Not only is it a triumph of pathos but also a brilliant achievement in film-making. Expansive set-pieces, technical wizardry and some of Chaplin's finest, most inventive tomfoolery. Some have argued that this film lacks the potent emotional drive or social commentary his other masterpieces had in abundance, but the New Year's Eve dinner sequence is truly heartbreaking, and the thousands of prospectors trudging up into the grim cold mountains in desperate search for gold at a time of depression provides a realistic, gritty backdrop against which the comedy can slowly and precariously unwind. I was a little troubled by the anti-climatic ending which didn't sit in too well with the rest of the film (he's with a woman who, while being the girl of his dreams, has already shown to have no affection for him whatsoever, only pity, and is more interested in a brutish womaniser) but up till then it's pure gold. Chaplin directs with a level of intimacy and restraint well ahead of his time. Also, Neil Brand's piano accompaniment is a welcome touch to this restored version I watched. Chaplin is undoubtedly the most famous figure in the history of cinema, and this film lends substantial weight to the argument that he was also the greatest.",

Sadly I saw a 1940s reissue of the film with narration by Chaplin over-top of the original silent film. The narration is not needed at all and in fact reduces ones enjoyment of this classic, Chaplin's acting is really all you need to ""get"" the story here, get the original if you can. So what can one say about the film? Well it's cute, its charming, warm hearted and clearly influenced film making and TV in many ways in years to come. Being a Chaplin film don't expect anything deep here, you're basically watching a heart warming slapstick comedy but one in which the acting and ""miming"" is just pitch perfect. It reminds me a lot of the Bugs Bunny and Road Runner cartoons of the 40s and 50s and clearly the slapstick of this era owns much to this film and others of the period. Some classic examples being the house teetering on the edge of a cliff, the character chase where the chaser becomes the chasee and or morphs into something else, the hungry man envisioning his partner as types of food, etc etc... This is of course the film with the classic bread roll dancing scene and I tell you too this very day it's still one of the most brilliant pieces of comedic miming I've ever seen. Chaplin is a genius at using his whole body to mime out scenes. There's an early example where he's supposed to be blown away by a heavy wind and it's clear that there's nothing more than a fan on set but by god does Chaplin do a picture perfect cartoonish mime of being blown away in the wind. Again though a reminder, get the original non narrated version.",
186,12 September 2010,tiffany_demeo,10, Gold Rush...No Words Needed.,"After watching ""The Gold Rush"" i now have a better appreciation for silent films and the era of silent films. I came into the movie with negative connotations about silent films and wondered, ""How could a film with no dialogue be interesting?"" I soon realized how this film became to be known as a masterpiece. Without dialogue, the actors really had to show how they were feeling through their movements and gestures. With the plot of a Gold Rush as a backdrop, the film really showed how one had to brave the elements of a harsh winter.",
187,13 September 2010,c-farrell7,8, A great silent comedy,"This was one of the first silent movies that I have ever seen. Overall I was pretty impressed with the quality and humor of the film. At first I was a little uneasy about sitting through a full length silent film but it definitely payed off. I greatly enjoyed it, Charlie Chaplin is a genius. He has great timing and is great at physical comedy. He has the ability to make you know what he is thinking just with his expressions and actions. I was also impressed by the cleverness of the filmmakers. The cabin scene was very well done. the tipping cabin was very funny and worked very well with Chaplin's physical comedy. The sets were also very beautifully done.",
188,30 January 2021,mckennaniedhammer,8, The Great Chaplin,"Although silent movies have slipped under this generations radar for the most part, this classic brings light into the history of the early 1900s. Chaplin found a way to mix comedy, with some tragic moments attached without affecting the overall mood of the movie. Even as the plot darkened and the men began to starve, I couldn't help but chuckle at some of the actors reactions and gestures.",

I had seen Charlie Chaplin shorts in the past and I've always found them quite humorous, but for whatever reason it wasn't until today I sat down and finally watched a Chaplin film. A good friend of mine said this was his favourite one. Without hesitation, I bought a cheap copy of 'The Gold Rush' and I can say that it has become one of my favourite comedies.",
190,29 September 2010,ecamm216,7," Good, Simple Comedy","This was my first Chaplin movie that I have watched and was very impressed. I felt he did live up to his name with his silly, simple humor. I was also impressed with how well the movie was put together for the time period it was in. There were some parts where you do realize that it was staged. For instance, showing when Chaplin was in the cabin on the mountain, the outside scenery was not real. Although, it was not, as the audience you still get sucked into the storyline and go with it. This movie made me appreciate movies from the silent era a little more. Instead of the actors speaking the story, music tells the story; you could fill in the blanks on your own and get the feeling of what is going on because of what kind of music is played during different scenes. I also really enjoyed how silly the humor was in the movie, it was not too over the top or too ridiculous. I thought it was funny when Chaplin is stuck in the cabin with another man and they do not have any food and are extremely desperate for food. The other man he is with imagines Chaplin as a chicken. I was very impressed with the way Chaplin faded into a chicken and back to himself and that it was done very well for the times in film making.",
191,3 October 2018,crisflor,7, Gold Rush,The reason why I watched this movie was because I was in class and I had too so I can get a grade and it was a goof movie. The filmmaker was telling us how comedy was back in and it was silent but funny because we would still understand it. I liked when he was dancing with this girl and he just gave this other dude a look like yeah I know I got that type of look. I also liked when he pulled that dog out from under the table like that makes no sense but its funny. There really wasn't anything that I didn't like about the movie. So I recommend that people should watch this film because its good comedy.,

I always wanted to try all kinds of genre of movies, so i decided to watch. Although i have very high expectation from this movie, but this movie has surpass my expectation. I really enjoyed this movie and i notice most of the modern day comedy film and drama still uses the tactics in this film, although this film probably has copied from even olden days movies, but this movie just hit the bullseye. All the tactics were used and reached the maximum potential. In conclusion, i enjoyed every second of this film. A definitely MUST WATCH before you die!",

Part 1- the movie shows the hard time the three main characters (prospector + Big Jim + Black Larson) were in when seeking the gold

199,24 August 2006,matthewrbray,9, Timeless Comedy,The Gold Rush is one of the top 10 comedies of all time.

200,26 September 2017,ajg-11283,9, Another Great movie by Charlie Chaplin,"The Gold Rush by Charlie Chaplin is a movie written and directed in the typical Chaplin Manner. Like most of Charlie Chaplains movies ""The Gold Rush"" takes you on a journey with chaplains most notable character ""The Tramp"". In this movie, Chaplin played the character of the lone prospector, a young naive miner hoping to strike it rich during the gold rush. the development of this character, although not very intensive was made easy due to the tramp being a very notable silent film character during this era. This is very important, even more so when cinematography was at a low due to video recording still being a new piece of technology. You could really tell during ""The Gold Rush"" that Charlie Chaplin was one of the great directors of the silent film era. He knew how to manipulate the actors to portray the story he was trying to tell in his story. As someone who never experienced silent film during its peak demand it is exciting and amusing to see how actors and directors can make the audience understand what is happening in a scene when there is no dialogue. One notable scene that really stuck out to me during this film was the scene when the Little Fellow and Big Jim where in the cabin during the storm. Eventually they ran out of food, and shortly after Big Jim Started to become Delirious. In a time in his life that Big Jim would eat anything (Leather shoes included) he started to see the Little Fellow as a giant Chicken. As you can probably assume if you have seen any other Chaplin movies this made for a very amusing chase scene that had me laughing along. It wasn't until after the movie finished that I realized just how much work had to go into just that scene alone. They didn't have the luxury of adding in an animation once the filming was all done. Directors had to get creative with how they were going to make scenes like this happen. It really makes you respect all the work put into something that we commonly think of as an old art form that has been replaced by the current movie era.",
201,27 September 2017,mbs-65614,10, The Best Silent Film I have Ever Seen,"I am not usually one to like silent films, but I very much enjoyed Gold Rush. Granted, I have watched only the 1942 re-release with background music and Chaplin's narration, so one might say that the movie I watched was not truly silent, but none of the characters really had voices and there were no sounds otherwise recorded while filming, so I am going to still consider it a silent film. But I digress. From start to finish Gold Rush is a charming, funny and overall entertaining film borne of the genius of Charlie Chaplin. ",
