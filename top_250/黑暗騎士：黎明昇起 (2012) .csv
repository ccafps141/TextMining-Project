0,1 January 2013,Geeky Randy,9, A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.,"After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Wayne's past. Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan's approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense and that's its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman's arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman's most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman's most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority—forget the Bane you saw in ""BATMAN & ROBIN"". Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger's posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger's performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.",/
1,19 January 2013,Maniac-9,10, Best comic movie trilogy ever,The Dark Knight Rises capped off what is probably the best comic book related trilogy of movies of all time. Earlier in the series you had Batman Begins and The Dark Knight with this just being the perfect way to finish off the series.,r
2,20 February 2021,Morejambo54,10, My personal favourite of the trilogy,"I think as a film stand point, the dark knight is a better movie that is better acted and tense the whole way through. The dark knight rises to me is a more fun and action filled movie that you can sit back a bit more. The acting is still amazing and combined with the atmosphere/visuals of the movie creates a the sense of realism that the movie has. That realism is where the intensity stems from throughout the movie, the audience believing that something like this could actually happen makes it that much scarier. Bane is also an excellent villain, in the dark knight the joker challenges Batman mentally but Bane physically challenges him which is a completely new challenge for Batman. The plot is incredible, it it starts fast and instantly brings you into the action. It then takes a step back to develop the characters further and build up the challenge Batman has to face. Once one of the many challenges was overcome by Batman in launches the viewer straight back into action for one epic final battle that lasts almost an hour......and it is GLORIOUS! Not one second was I bored, it is truly incredible how each movie in the trilogy is this good, it shouldn't be possible. I've not even mentioned the incredible soundtrack to compliment the astounding yet grounded action. I can't compliment this movie enough. If you haven't someone seen this trilogy yet....watch it, you won't be disappointed.",e
3,2 June 2013,CaptKeshav,9, Epic,"The Dark Knight Rises was a perfect sequel to a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan took a different direction and focused more on Bruce Wayne/Batman. This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The more I watch it, The more epic it gets. Personally, I think The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest Trilogy of all time and this movie gives the greatest ending of all time in the movie history. I remember seeing it thrice and the more I watched It the more respect it earns. Thank you Christopher Nolan, You Sir Are A Master.",v
4,20 July 2012,darkslash7,10, No one wraps up a trilogy like Nolan.,"Wow. That's all I can say. I was freaked out about this movie, because I loved the first two. Too often have I gotten into a series, then been horribly disappointed by the last entry (e.g. the hunger games. I hated the third book). That being said, even though I was nervous, I still had high expectations. And it exceeded those. The acting was excellent, consistently to the previous movies. The action was good. The story was great. The characters were diverse and interesting, and despite the longevity of this film, it wasn't too slow at all. ",i
5,2 November 2012,TheLittleSongbird,9, What a way to end the trilogy!,"Possibly my personal favourite of the Nolan Batman films, and I do like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight very much. Is it perfect? For me, not quite, there are so many plot strand in a long running time that the film occasionally(and there is a big emphasis on that) sags in momentum and some of the strands in the ending could have done with more development. It is a brilliant film all the same, one of the highlights so far of the year. As to expect from Christopher Nolan, it is a visually audacious film, with gorgeous cinematography, a beautifully realised Gotham City and great special effects. Hans Zimmer's score is not one of his very best for me, but there is still an epic and haunting quality that is just perfect for this film. The dialogue provokes thought and makes an emotional impact, and a vast majority of the time The Dark Knight Rises is ambitious and gripping. I don't consider Christopher Nolan one of my favourites, this said he is a hugely impressive director who shows great ambition and a willingness to make his subject matters interesting. He does a really wonderful job here, as the set/action pieces including the plane hijack and Bane's assault on Gotham are enough to make the jaw drop. The performances are just terrific from all involved, Matthew Modine fares weakest but he is far from bad. Christian Bale is still a charismatic presence, Matthew Caine appropriately loyal and Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman subtly understated. Joseph Gordon Levitt captures his character's idealism wonderfully. Tom Hardy is in beefed-up terrifying mode as Bane, a worthy successor to Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. Anne Hathaway was a curious casting choice, but as Catwoman she is spot on, here is a Catwoman who actually does much more than acting sexy(which she still is), she is very ruthless and no-nonsense here. All in all, a hugely impressive film, the best of Nolan's Batman trilogy- though I'm prepared for any flaming I'll get for this opinion- and one of the highlights so far of 2012. 9/10 Bethany Cox",e
6,18 July 2012,Christopher_Reid,10, It was okay...,"The best thing about this movie is how satisfying it is. It doesn't leave you frustrated or confused. You can't really complain that it didn't explore certain ideas or follow through. By deciding to have an official ending to this trilogy's story, the themes surrounding Batman are very fresh. We don't know where he'll end up. It's not the same old thing about whether he can continue to be Batman or not, which was already getting repetitive in Spider-man 2. The conclusions are not as important as the feelings they invoke as they come about. Nolan is especially good at capturing the complete tension of actually not knowing what will happen and deeply questioning what you *want* to happen and why.",w
7,19 July 2012,DICK STEEL,10, A Nutshell Review: The Dark Knight Rises,"There are plenty of elements that made this film work, so I suppose we can tick them off one by one. For starters, the continuation on the focus of Bruce Wayne's story, which has made it all tick. This version of Bruce Wayne and Alfred become the familiar characters we're accustomed with since 2005, and the film invests heavily on the emotional bonding between the two, which deals back to the theme about fear that rears its ugly head again, and how a father figure cannot stand idly by to watch the one he brought up recklessly charge into battle after a long hiatus, and hoping for a life of normalcy with the mantle of the bat given up. Michael Caine may have a shorter screen time than before, but no less powerful.",/
8,16 July 2012,Loving_Silence,10," Best Film of 2012, so far!","I had the honor of watching TDKR during a screening and was completely blown away! Christopher Nolan's third film in his Batman trilogy doesn't disappoint. The movie is incredibly well made, its huge production is quite breathtaking to view. This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The movie's score high-lites many of its incredible scenes, and at times, it takes your breath away.",r
9,16 July 2012,Joaquin_Collete,10, Stunning Conclusion to an Epic Trilogy,"Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch. ",w
10,30 July 2012,zardoz-13,10," The Best ""Batman"" Movie Ever!!!","I cannot imagine a ""Batman"" movie after ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (**** out of ****) without ""Inception"" director Christopher Nolan at the helm. Warner Brothers and DC Comics got this legendary costume-clad crime fighter trilogy 'right.' Sure, you can nitpick, but Nolan's ""Batman"" movies differed in ambiance from those of both Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher. Nolan's ""Batman"" movies trod a thin line turning a vigilante into a hero and scrutinizing the morality of his behavior. Essentially, Nolan rebooted the franchise, recreated Bruce Wayne and Batman as troubled alter-egos, and turned the good versus evil episodes of the earlier films into full-blown spectacles. While sticking slavishly to the basics, he relied on his fertile imagination to give the characters greater depth and examine the issue of vigilantism. Nolan's Caped Crusader movies don't rely on humor as much as slight, off-hand comments. The action unfolds swiftly, and the characters are clearly delineated before the end credits roll. You prepare yourself for the surprises. The films replicate the haunted quality that Burton forged with his Michael Keaton forays, while Schumacher embraced a bright, heavily saturated, slightly surreal comic book quality. Of course, the ""Batman"" graphic novels of Frank Miller have influenced Nolan. Christian Bale's part in the success of the trilogy is considerable. He is more of a Michael Keaton ""Batman"" than either a Val Kilmer or a George Clooney crime fighter. Bale is to Batman the same way that Sean Connery was to Bond. Long-time British actor Michael Caine makes a superb Alfred Pennyworth, but Michael Gough was no slouch himself in the four previous ""Batman"" incarnations. Unquestionably, Nolan steps back from Batman at the Caped Crime Buster's zenith. The ending to this trilogy capper is odd. Indeed, Warner Brothers conceivably could make another ""Batman"" movie based on Nolan's conclusion to ""The Dark Knight Rises.""",2

13,28 March 2014,the-saboteur-200-676519,10, Head to head with Dark Knight,"After watching Dark Knight Rises I concluded that if there is anybody who can make kick-ass sequels its Nolan. The film contains everything, from brilliant acting, raw action, out of the world one-liners and amazing cinematography. It is already very hard to make a sequel for a film which was just good enough hit but to make a sequel for a film which will always be remembered as the best you have to do a very impeccable job and that is what is done in this movie. From the beginning to the end you have some very beautiful and emotional scenes like the mob fight between the police and the thugs, the rise of the Batman from the prison and the chants ""Deshi Deshi Basura Basura"" towards the end where Alfred and Bruce see each other for probably the last time and both know that he has made it.",1
14,20 July 2012,billygoat1071,10, The Grand Experience,"Christopher Nolan reinvents Batman in a powerful and much darker way. Batman Begins is a gripping and compelling origin of the hero. The Dark Knight is a lot more serious, realistic, and powerful Batman movie. The Dark Knight Rises is the last of the series. It is ought to be larger and better. It does succeed to be the biggest of the rest of the series. Although, it's not as as superior as The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight Rises is still a fantastic and grand cinematic experience.",2
15,5 July 2013,edwagreen,3, For My Part The Dark Knight Rises Could Have Stayed Below *,It takes over one-hour in this overly long miserable film to establish the plot-another terrorist campaign against the city of Gotham and its residents. The flashbacks relating to medieval times are of absolutely no value here.,8
16,18 July 2016,notafanof,5, The dull knight,"Much like Zack Snyder's Meh of feels, TDKR is a bloated, incoherent mess. It's obvious that Mr. Nolan was forced into directing this movie so he could make interstellar. The film feels rushed and is poorly edited. There is a moment near the end of the film where a character says that they have 21 days till a bomb goes off. Then, literally in the next scene, they say they have 5 hours till the bomb goes. Apparently this film has a floating time line inside it's ridiculous running time. So many inconsistencies and plot holes that took me out of the film. Sure, the dark knight had some plot holes, but it never seemed to break the rules of the universe it was set in. This film breaks the rules established in the previous films in every scene. How did nearly every single cop in the city get lured into the sewers in the first place? They couldn't have a drone or a robot check and then send a swat team down? This film also has the distinction of being too long and not having enough in it. There must be scenes on the cutting floor that would've made some of the stranger and downright stupid parts of this film make more sense. The best parts of this film are the parts I was skeptical about. Hathaway's Catwoman is fantastic and fits well in this universe, as does the menacing Bane- who Tom Hardy emulates with very cold and haunted eyes. The fight scenes are great, and the acting is top notch. But something seems...Off. The writing is more on the nose than in the dark knight, and some parts don't add up. The pit in this movie seems like it belongs more in Inception.The ending to this movie is what really ruined it. Another race against the clock climax that's been done ten thousand times before. The 'twist' could have also been done better. The most disappointed I had ever been in a sequel until the force awakens was released. A 5 out of 10 for Chris Nolan's worst film.",4

20,16 December 2012,Leofwine_draca,9," Sometimes predictable, but often astonishing","Christopher Nolan's stunning conclusion to his Batman trilogy is a welcome return to form after the slightly overrated THE DARK KNIGHT, which was so obsessed with being all dark and brooding that it forgot to tell much of a story. Despite the presence of a much-hyped (and lamented) Heath Ledger in the cast, I found that film to be less entertaining than BATMAN BEGINS although it still remains an engaging and watchable film. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (horrible title, by the way), though, blows it out of the water, offering a piece of sheer spectacle that's as involving and as tightly-plotted as you could wish for.",e

25,14 June 2018,ravenosa,3, The worst of the 3 Nolan Batman movies,"Not sure what they saw in the screenplay to actually go ahead with this film! Not a particularly compelling plot at all, and most sections just drag and drag on with no pay off. Doesn't really end on much of a note.",t
26,28 July 2012,Ziya90,1, Where is The Batman?,"From the beginning, I have appreciated ""the crime epic"" or ""the crime saga"" approach of the director towards Batman, despite I don't stick with realism in cinema, however in this movie, Nolan goes too far and we watch a movie which has almost zero effect on the audience as a Batman movie! What Roland Emmerich did in 2012 is what Nolan did in this movie! I don't pay to watch a crime film without Batman! In TDKR, Batman is like a metaphor, yes believe me, in the first half (80 minutes approx.) we watch Batman in only one or two scenes and the part (the chase) was may be the best part of the movie! As some other moviegoers said, it is all about story telling with no break, but no break! You can't feel the film, because it is like you have no time to do that! How can I say, the movie is exhausting, you feel exhausted, yes that's the word! And if you suppose that in the second half, Batman rises immediately, my answer would be not exactly! As said, TDKR is about Bruce Wayne, other characters, themes, but not Batman! Therefore I felt cheated. And I always think that Mr. Nolan is not a good action director. In the first half, Batman has an interesting gadget, I have no idea what was the function of it, but he doesn't use it! So? Yes, the movie has plenty good action, it has its moments, but I can't say it is great! Nolan shoots chase scenes, in all of his Batman movies, there is chase sequence, but is this enough? There are some other type of action in TDKR, but don't expect an action-packed! (I'd expected) There is no character development for new characters except for Bane. As for Catwoman, Catwoman is not even spelled in the movie! Was she really Catwoman? What was her motivation? She was not a dominant character as it should be! Even the introduction of the character was poor! And she could have been sexy! We can't see even her body! A different interpretation? well, the problem here is Nolan doesn't care about the characters, it was the same in Batman Begins (Scarecrow) it was the same in The Dark Knight (Batman himself) He just puts a character forward, Catwoman, a burglar, OK next! Miranda Tate, a business woman, OK next! Something like that. John Blake is a well written character, a cop, at least he has a motivation! However, for example Miranda Tate is out of place! It feels like Nolan likes Cotillard and wants to work with her, they know each other from Inception etc. Mrs. Cotillard is a very beautiful and talented actress, but in this movie, she is just out of place. Bane is the scene stealer, the performance of Tom Hardy is great, his voice is brilliant, he is evil, he is bad-ass, but he disappoints because of two reasons: first, as you know too, in Nolan's story, Bane doesn't use steroids or he isn't exposed to poison known as venom, so he doesn't grow bigger. Second, the twist at the end ruins this character very badly and there is a scene which you feel like he is a henchman! And wasn't Bane big like in the comics in the teaser trailer? Was I cheated again? The final parts which are called climactic by a lot of people were not that climactic and there is nothing different or original! I expected to be amazed, surprised etc. but it didn't happen. This is a cold movie! The movie has not any impact on you, you can't feel the film, almost zero emotion throughout the film (like Inception) but except two part! The fight between Batman and Bane and the chase in the first half! If the whole film had been like that, I would have given 100 out of 10! The cinematography and the art direction are not dominant like The Dark Knight, the editing is like non-stop events with no break (now joke time! the only break was the regular 10 minutes break in the middle of the movie!) Also the film was too noisy at times. I didn't find the movie overlong, but what I get bored was watching a Batman movie without Batman! I found Batman Joker showdown in The Dark Knight anti climactic, low key and short, but this time it was much worse! That's why movies like Terminator 2 are masterpieces, am I wrong? You can't imagine how it ends! I almost found it ridiculous! TDKR is not a ""rich"" film especially in the content, so it is like ""poor man's Batman movie"" Personally my another problem with TDKR was it has zero ""comic book feel"" At least, TDK had it at times! After some statements of Nolan, the fate of John Blake made me laugh! Miranda Tate's climactic plan was boring and how can I say? it had no excitement or tense, because it was simple and cliché? Especially for such an ""epic"" movie! Doesn't this epic final deserve originality? By the way, Nolan doesn't even know how to shoot a snowy scene or he just doesn't care about it! Another problem, the mystery and suspense in the trailers were missing. And realism doesn't mean that the movie is deep or in comparison with other super hero movies, it is deeper, No, No! That's because Nolan is not interested in characters, instead he is ""event driven"" And couldn't the war between Batman and the other bad guys (the chaos) be handled better? The only good thing about this movie for me was Nolan avoids ""crowd-pleaser humor"" in this movie! The Dark Knight Rises may be a well made film, but as a ""Batman"" movie, it is quite empty.",_
27,1 July 2013,nicholls_les,1, Rubbish,"By the time this over long tripe had finished I had lost all interest and could not wait to leave. The story was idiotic, the plot laughable and the characters totally unbelievable. Bane, was a silly pointless villain. What was his plan again? Oh yes to kill himself and everyone else? What tosh! And that crying scene that Michael Caine did? What was his point? It just looked like he had said to the director, 'let me do a bit of good acting, don't worry about the fact that what I am saying makes no sense' And Batman has his back severely damaged and is in a cell where he gets little food but makes the most miraculous recovery since Lazarus. In this film Batman is weak, the Villains are pointless, The plot is nonsense and the whole film seems to be riding on special effects for special effects sake!

28,2 January 2013,poe426,1, Godawful on a Grand Scale...,"Hundreds of millions of dollars, and the best they can do is yet another bloated episode of a TV cop show??? The first hour or 90 minutes of this talking heads marathon plays out like a segment of LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND BORING. Maybe the Nolans haven't gotten the news, yet, but We ain't all that fond of watching the Rich wallow in their Riches over here. Where was the guy we came to see- the guy with the black leather body armor and the cape? Doing his impression of Howard Huge! Really? THAT'S what we came to see? (Not that that really matters: Batman gets outed yet again in this installment. Little wonder he doesn't bother to suit up...) Nolan's idea of an Occupy Movement says a lot, I think: the VILLAINS take over City Hall (or whatever it is in this monstrously slow-moving movie) and are set upon at film's end by Gotham's finest like peaceful protesters at a sit-in. The guy who plays Bane seems to be channeling Sean Connery, and Catwoman transmorgriphies, finally, into Batwoman. At least the worst-designed Batmobile in the 70-plus year history of the character has been laid to rest (not to mention the aerodynamically unsound piece of flying wreckage that's supposed to be the Batplane). (I've always thought that SPAWN was by far the worst-designed comic book character in comic book history- a mish-mash of ideas lifted from Spider-man and Doctor Strange-and a character whose name was ripped off from a Jack Kirby NEW GODS story- but the Batmobile in this trilogy made me step back and reevaluate things. Batman's wheels in these films look like slabs of scrap metal haphazardly fused or magnetized together. Hopefully, we've seen the last of them.) For future reference: filmmakers, if we pay money to see a super-hero movie, it's because we want to see the super-hero- NOT his UNsuper-heroic alter ego. Is THAT so hard to grasp?",r

37,21 July 2012,rooee,4, Fails to Rise to the occasion,"Nolan's recent blockbusters stand like looming corporate architecture: shining and cerebral; stately and sexless. His scripts are like visitors' guides to these spaces, proudly explaining every detail, surgically removing every doubt. His tell-don't-show insistence is of an artist possessing consummate technical skill and curiosity, but one unwilling to allow his crafted geometric edges to be rounded off with anything approaching satire or self-effacement.

Anne Hathaway was horrible, she was not convincing at all and her outfit looked like a cheap Halloween costume. Bane, the main villain of this movie was killed in a split second and everything was forgotten about him, that's it. It's like the script writers wanted this movie to end quickly as possible at this point. The actor playing Miranda who appears to be Ra's Al Ghul's daughter Talia should get the award for worst death presentation, it was some of the worst acting I have ever seen, you can tell that she is acting. It's like she is taking a nap for crying out loud. Blake who appears to be Robin gets access to the Batman cave and all the high tech stuff that is in there, but he didn't receive any training at all so he wouldn't know how to use it.

He proved himself with Batman Begins, then showed with TDK that sequels needn't stink (they can even surpass the originals). Now he's proven himself once again and that it's indeed possible to make an epic conclusion to a film trilogy that doesn't ruin the memory of the prior films. Of course, there'll be those unsatisfied with this film and its ending (those with impossible standards who built the film up so much in their minds that no matter what, they would complain). For those with realistic expectations, however, this film should more than live up to what you'd hoped for.",

The good guy seemed to be the Batman, but he was too willowy and wispy, and during his frequent bouts of fisticuffs with the bad guy he always got the worst of it. At one point I thought the plot was vaguely modelled on the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. But only vaguely. It would possibly have been helpful to know how the several other stars had been designed to fit in to this benighted epic. I think we should have been told. But I couldn't make it out. My fault, no doubt. After a few hours of bafflement, the scene was suddenly flooded with light, and civilization was saved. The question remained: Had it been worth it ? Not really.

44,1 January 2013,Wrapper30,8, Enjoyable yet predictable. Disappointing.,I sat down last night on New Years Eve replacing the festivities with a big blockbuster that I was looking forward to watching. One word to describe it is disappointing. It just does not reach the heights of the second film and the main reason for that is the villain. This is not the fault of the 3rd film really as Heath Ledger was just fantastic in the 2nd film. It is that Bane is just so one dimensional in comparison and that is not down to Tom Hardy in any way. There just needed to be more mystique and terror around him but he was just a big lump with a fairly incoherent and gruff voice. And Catwoman? Sorry but Anne Hathaway is just not good enough to play this role and her turn to be at Wayne's side at the end-preposterous. And Blake to be Robin was telegraphed from the moment he came on the screen. AND all the police force to get caught down the sewers-ppllleeaasse no. BUT it was worth 8 out of 10 as it was a spectacular blockbuster let down by a little weakness in the plot and one dimensional characterisation.,
45,21 July 2012,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, A satisfying conclusion to a fantastic trilogy... so that's what that feels like,"It's been eight years since the events of the immediate predecessor to this(a film that this matches in most ways, tops in several, and the only thing it lacks that that has, is Heath Ledger's Joker, and, well, that's part force majeure), and we see the outcome of that. Legislation has made organized crime a thing of the past in the city, and with no need for the caped crusader, Bruce(once again impeccably acted by Bale... and yes, the voice has thankfully been toned down) has a gap in his life that he doesn't know how to fill(straining the relationship between him and Alfred, played by the usually charming and compelling Caine). When a mysterious masked man, known as Bane, a dominating physical presence with a brain(played largely by Hardy's eyes and brows... taking a ton of his tools as an actor away, and still he does incredible), with unclear motives makes his presence known, he realizes he will have to become Batman again. But is he enough to take out this new threat? This finishes the series, providing closure to the characters and story. Catwoman is done right here, and just about perfect. She's finally a femme fatale... hot and manipulative. They do with her what we hoped they'd do with Black Widow. And this does justice to the relationship between her and Wayne. The performances are great all around. Most return from the other two(and Freeman gets a lot more to do), with a few new faces, such as Gordon-Levitt as idealistic cop John. This does a lot to surprise us, and like TDk, it does it right, with hardly any of them being unnecessary, and none of them insulting. The bleakness is back and amplified - this puts its titular hero and its audience through a serious amount of pain and conflict, with a genuine feeling that it might not work out. And as a result of this, and other brave decisions made(you can barely believe these are mainstream movies!), it becomes really powerful, really draws us in. The action is the biggest and best of these(the jet he uses is awesome! And the Pod gets some more really cool use, in the edge-of-your-seat chases, and we get fast martial arts(and covered well!), and the stakes and tension are the highest(and frankly, if they were raised any higher, it would be excessive... this is already as draining as the last one). There is a lot of disturbing content, some violence and a little moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone interested in these(and make sure you've watched the other two first, this really adds to them). 10/10",

Then there's Miranda Tate and Elektra King; beautiful,foreign businesswomen who deal in global energy.Both earn the trust of the hero (Bond/Wayne) while becoming romantically involved with them, though it's all a part of their plan to use the hero's company (MI6 and Wayne Enterprises) to her own ends.

58,16 February 2021,benmundie,9, Really Good End to Nolan's Great Trilogy,"'The Dark Knight Rises' is the third and final instalment in Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking trilogy that reshaped the superhero genre as we know it. The main cast return as well as some newcomers. Tom Hardy as 'Bane', Anne Hathaway as 'Selina', Joseph Gordon-Levitt as 'Blake' and Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda'.
The new additions are fantastic, especially Tom Hardy. He brings a menacing presence to the character and finally incorporates the main part of his comic counterpart, his brains. For sure Bane is incredibly strong, but he is also an unbelievable strategist that can systematically wear down Batman whilst also using his strength to defeat him. Hardy displays all of this perfectly despite us barely seeing his face, the mask he wears makes him more frightening and is used as an interesting plot device later in the film. A lot of people criticised the voice that Hardy uses for this character, but personally I love it, I think adds to the mystery of the figure.
The best acting comes from Michael Caine as 'Alfred Pennyworth'. Nolan really fleshes out Alfred and Bruce's relationship in this film and Caine plays the reluctant mentor figure perfectly. One of his final scenes really shows off his acting, the regret that Alfred pours out and it's heartbreaking. Whilst all of the other actors are great, Caine excels in this movie compared to 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'.
The writing is brilliant, so many twists and turns and a sensational ending that really brings the trilogy full circle and has a great ending to Bruce's arc. The dialogue is excellent, in particular the many Bane monologues that add another layer onto his great character. The fight choreography improves massively and is loads better than the last two films. Hanz Zimmers score is superb and works in all scenes that it features in. Also, the cinematography is beautiful, Wally Pfister, who has worked with Nolan throughout the trilogy, really peaks in this picture.
However, this movie isn't perfect, Bane's final demise is very underwhelming, especially for a character that makes as much of an impact as he does. Finally the twist at the end with Blake feels tacked on and is inaccurate to the source material.
Overall, I love this movie, for sure it doesn't live up to the heights of 'The Dark Knight' but it is still exceptional and was a stunning way to end this unbelievable series of films.",

This film, supposedly the last in the Christopher Nolan trilogy (though there is a cliffhanger) ranks in the nether regions with Thor and Daredevil, scrabbling around looking for scraps of entertainment. It's also nearly an hour longer than Dark Knight and probably 30 minutes longer than it needs to be. Nolan can't figure out what to do with Catwoman while Anne Hathaway never comes close to eclipsing the memory of Michelle Pfeiffer's performance. But the biggest and worst mistake was the villain: Bane. (Why not the Riddler, many will ask. Why not indeed?) Bane has a box strapped across his face,which makes it impossible to understand him, particularly during several, long, bombastic speeches he's given. It's a distracting, distancing device that keeps the audience from really SEEING the character. Michael Caine and Joseph Gordon-Levitt give compelling performances and the special effects and set design are as huge as you can expect from the budget. But there are a number of scenes that too closely--and tastelessly, mine the memories of New York City post-9/11. And overall, it's just too long, crammed with exposition and flashbacks.

With his trilogy finally complete and the all those involved moving on to other projects, I'll be curious to see where the comic book movie genre goes next. When I first saw THE DARK KNIGHT RISES in theaters (a midnight showing, of course, and one of the few I've attended), I admit I was initially disappointed but additional viewings have helped me appreciate it a lot more. The movie is set eight years following the events of THE DARK KNIGHT with Batman going on the run and the true details of Harvey Dent's death buried in hopes of using him as Gotham's shining hero. The city has enjoyed a time of peace as crime is at an all-time low, but this is all about to change. A terrorist named Bane has his sights set on Gotham. He arises under the guise as a freedom fighter with the goal of bringing the upper class to their knees while the lower class are allowed to rise to power, but Bane is no hero.

Batman is a friggin wussy compared to how he was portrayed by Michal Keaton, not to mention you can hardly understand anything Bane says. Gorden levitt looks like he was hoping for a part as boy wonder/ robin. The only good character her was Matthew Modine, and I don't even like him much. But this is one of the better parts he has played by far. I found it funny how a bunch of super trained mercenaries can't seem to hit a bunch of police men moving in line side by side.

I have this on Bluray and had to back it up multiple times, and still some things were impossible for me to understand. Along with this was Bane's audio which was even more difficult for me to make out. I realize it fashionable to emphasize/hype-up the audio for the rock-concert effect. But there was so much bottom-end EQ-boost it made for much of his dialog unintelligible.*Spoiler-alert* (2) Four times in the last 30 minutes someone is on the brink of being killed ( or at least seriously hurt) only to be rescued.

81,26 July 2012,promin1792,1, The god-awful third part of a good trilogy.,"After seeing and liking the first and the second part of this trilogy, the third came off as a disappointment. There are only a few things that actually work in this movie - Hathaway an Levitt gave very nice performances, and were convincing despite of the ludicrously cliché lines they were given. Before seeing the movie, I presumed that (based on the reviews I had read) they had only minor roles, but the two of them guide the plot. Also some action sequences were well executed. But only a minority of them. The majority was illogical and confusing. In comparison with the second movie which I found to be, in its core ( even with the occasional shabby lines), an intelligent and elegant movie, this one lacks action. Of course that a movie shouldn't be judged by the amount of action, but in lack of it there must be a good storyline. This movie has none. Its plot is full of gaps, frustratingly illogical. One of the things that induced from me a great snore was the jail and childwhoescaped subplot. The idea of the jail is absurd. Whose prison is it, why are there no guards? Oh, I know it's inescapable... but please. Its location is outside of some ancient city walls, but very near it, and a modern complex is build only yards away (you can see it on the edge of the screen when Bruce escapes – but I will get to that). Bane (the Big Bad of the movie) escorted Bruce to the Asian jail himself, made all that way just to tell Bruce that he will torture his soul, and went back to Gotham, in the US, in the matter of hours. Why making that journey? It's impractical as hell. Furthermore, the man in prison, who are paid by Bane to keep Bruce alive (the man actually uttered the line – I'm paid more to keep you alive, when Bruce asked for death), are helping him fix his dislocated spine (no, it's not broken) and escape. Why? After a few tries, Bruce manages to climb the well and emerges on the surface. He throws some big, fat rope back in the pit. Where did that rope come from? Was it left outside just in case someone climbed to freedom so he can free all the other prisoners? Bruce himself had no rope – that was the whole point. Is the prisoners safety rope actually tied at the surface? If so, why no one climbed the rope itself? Hell, my brother with whom I watched the movie actually thought that he threw down the safety rope to make sure nobody else would escape. Then Bruce, with no money, no passport and no knowledge of the native language returns in the terrorist occupied and military guarded Gotham. He also, at the time, has no Batmobile, Batcopter or any other Bat-based vehicle. How did he get into the city? Fortunately, once in the city, he found his Bat-copter lying on the roof of a middle-height building, a huge thing covered only with a nett, and visible from air. With all the riots in the city, is it possible that nobody had stumbled upon it? Also, once in the Bat-copter, he encourages the not-long-ago buried police forces (who all have clean clothes and are clean-shaved after being underground for months) to attack the terrorists, but instead of helping them by shooting the enemy from air superiority, he lands the Bat-copter and seeks Bane for a fistfight. Is this not idiotic? The only action scene that was good was the one after the stock-market attack when Batman made a dashing escape. But, not even this scene can be compared with the ones from the second movie which were thrilling, masterfully directed and longer. They were also simpler, there was no atom bomb, there were just guns and explosives, but it worked better, it was more realistic, and darker. Unfortunately, what replaced action is load of parapsychology, the endlessly recycled story of the orphan Bruce, with many annoying flashbacks from previous films. You know the movie is not doing well when there are flashbacks involved. What got on my nerves a lot was also that all lectured Bruce, the man who sacrificed everything to help Gotham and do good. Alfred was particularly pathetic. Bane is truly a poorly done movie villain. The comic book character is said to have some intelligence. This was not present here. The opening scene, the delivery of the plan of doctor Pavel's abduction: Bane has executed a pointlessly expensive and complicated operation where he sacrificed unnecessarily three of his man, chopped up a plane and then used the already seen skyhook (The Dark Knight), when he easily could have attacked the plane on land. The romance between him and Coltirald's character is also redundant. His and Cotillard's background story could have been left unexplained. Even with it, both of them lack motivation. The rest of the movie Bane makes impressive entries. Actually a lot of the movie is about walking on the street, walking through the sewage, etc. And entering rooms. The romance between Bruce and Cotillard character was redundant and not probable (I accept this only if Bruce wanted a quick shag after a long time of drought). The explosion, beside the unnerving need of certain directors to explain in word what we understood in picture (someone actually had said Explosion! after we've have already seen the mushroom), was not realistic (no waves). But, as a whole, the movie is sufferable, just don't expect anything great. The thing I hated the most is that Batman is missing from this film. Bruce was more out of the suit, than in it. Seems to me that Nolan became a little bit too cocky with all the praise for the two previous movies. It's a shame because the movie could have been a lot better if he hadn't.",

Normally when you think of trilogy's the third one is always the weakest one-Godfather part 3, Spiderman 3, Matrix Revolutions. However, this movie is-in my opinion-the strongest of the Nolan Batman Trilogy. Nolan proved to all of the critics that he was right with going of the character of Bane, a terrorist who has great plans to fulfil his destiny in the city of Gotham. Tom Hardy excels in this role and it is one of his best roles in any movie he's done. He is required to do a lot of acting with his eyes and he has great screen presence, it immediately makes you feel intimidated. Anne Hathaway added depth to the Catwoman character, and portrayed her excellently. Yet, the icing on the cake is Christian Bale who reprises his role of Batman. The whole atmosphere in Gotham is created through Nolan's direction of the film. It's a very dark setting, darker than The Dark Knight was, but this adds further to the main theme of the story-redemption. It was the best movie in 2012 and Nolan, I thank you for a superb trilogy!",

It's a culmination of every action taken by The Batman coming down in the form of some menacing villains. It's the most anticipated movie of 2012 and because the bar has been raised so ridiculously high, it doesn't quite live up to the expectations. That doesn't mean that is a bad movie. DKR has excellent performances, a tense story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, cool additions to the Batman mythology and a compelling villain. The climax is one intense experience and what Tom Hardy does with just his eyes and his voice is unbelievable. He is a truly frightening foe for The Batman. Some of the criticisms I have concern the pacing of the film. I felt like at times it runs slightly too long and some of the slow beginning should have been cut a bit. Once the momentum gets going you won't want to miss a single second.

Thankfully Nolan was brave enough to resurrect him in 2005, and in 2008 we got The Dark Knight, a film which turned what we knew about blockbusters and superhero flicks upside-down.

104,5 December 2012,Vishal_s_kumar,9," ""Oh boy, you are in for a show tonight""","Seven years of appreciation, seven years of hindsight. In 2005, Batman Begins was a critical, creative and financial success. It remains a thrilling introduction to Nolan's brave new Gotham. In 2008, The Dark Knight arrived to thunderous applause, smashed records, earned more than a billion at the box office, and mounted an equally impressive run on home video. It still stands as one of the best comic book movies of all time; a near-perfect culmination of everything the genre has fought so long to achieve. Then came this past summer and the release of The Dark Knight Rises. Could it escape the dreaded trilogy capper curse? Could it surpass The Dark Knight? Would it deliver a satisfying conclusion to Nolan's Batman saga? It's been eight years since Harvey Dent plummeted to his death. Eight years since Batman took the real fall and disappeared from the public eye. Eight years since Gotham City police commissioner James Gordon (Gary Oldman) agreed to allow the city to mourn a villain and forsake its hero. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is a recluse, his butler and friend Alfred (Michael Caine) is his only contact with the outside world, and his father's company is safely in the hands of trusted ally in arms, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). But when a new evil comes to Gotham with plans to level the city -- a terrorist mastermind and former member of the League of Shadows known only as Bane (Tom Hardy) -- Wayne decides it's time for Batman to return. To stop Bane, Batman first elicits the help of cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), beat cop-turned- detective John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Wayne Enterprises board member Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard). Ultimately, though, Wayne has to face his greatest fears if he hopes to pry Gotham from Bane's steel grip. Even though The Dark Knight Rises was more divisive than many anticipated -- it is, after all, a vastly different film than mass audiences were expecting -- those who returned to the theater more than once hopefully discovered a more masterfully crafted tale than they may have caught the first time around. Nolan and younger brother/co-screenwriter Jonathan Nolan skip the sort of traditional three-act structure that might lighten their load and divide the film into three grand Acts, each of epic proportion.(Beware. Mild spoilers lurk ahead.) Act I: Bane emerges, Batman is broken and Gotham is left unprotected. Act II: Bruce is locked away, Bane makes his move and Gotham is held hostage. Act III: the Dark Knight returns, Bane tightens his grip and Gotham hangs in the balance. Months pass. Seasons change. Power shifts hands. Forces collide. And the game changes forever. It's almost too much for one movie to encompass. And yet there's just enough time to pull it off. No scene is wasted, no shot is squandered, no moment is tangential. Every piece moves at Nolan's command, nothing slips by the director's watchful eye and every theme, arc and obstacle established in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight is brought full circle. My first viewing was thrilling but bewildering. The initially jarring breaks from one act to the next knocked me off balance, and the sudden lurch into ""No Man's Land"" territory only exacerbated matters. Wayne's early sluggishness, wounded and ineffectiveness gave me pause as well, Alfred's exile from much of the story baffled me, and the film seemed to lack the strong but steady momentum and ragged-edge inventiveness of its predecessors. It was still an incredible experience, made even more incredible in IMAX, but it seemed to lack the dexterity of Begins and the will, fortitude and raw power of The Dark Knight. But oh what a difference a second viewing can make. Once-jarring breaks allowed previously unforeseen heroes to fill the void left in Batman's absence. Wayne's resignation and fall only enrich everything that follows. Alfred's absence strips the Dark Knight of his greatest ally and leaves him vulnerable to the betrayals to come. The film's ultimate reveal traces back through all three films and unites them more than any other element. And the momentum and inventiveness I craved were out in full force, albeit so radical in comic book nature that I nearly failed to notice the intricacies of Nolan's master plan.",

110,2 March 2022,GusherPop,10, Favorite and best made Batman Film,"""The Dark Knight Rises"" leaves the fanciful early days of the superhero genre far behind, and moves into a doom-shrouded, apocalyptic future that seems uncomfortably close to today's headlines. As urban terrorism and class warfare envelop Gotham and its infrastructure is ripped apart, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) emerges reluctantly from years of seclusion in Wayne Manor and faces a soulless villain as powerful as he is. The film begins slowly with a murky plot and too many new characters, but builds to a sensational climax. Bane, played by Tom Hardy in a performance evoking a homicidal pro wrestler, is a mystery because it's hard to say what motivates him. He releases thousands of Gotham's criminals in a scenario resembling the storming of the Bastille. As they face off against most of the city police force in street warfare, Bane's goal seems to be the overthrow of the ruling classes. But this would prove little if his other plan succeeds. Bane stages two other sensational set pieces, involving destroying the Stock Exchange and blowing up a football stadium, that seemed aimed at our society's twin gods of money and pro sports. No attempt is made to account for Bane's funding and resources, and when it finally comes down to Bane and Batman going mano-a-mano during a street fight, it involves an anticlimactic fist-fight. This is a dark and heavy film; it tests the weight a superhero movie can bear. That Nolan is able to combine civil anarchy, mass destruction and a Batcycle with exercise-ball tires is remarkable. That he does it without using 3D is admirable. That much of it was shot in the 70mm IMAX format allows it to make that giant screen its own. That it concludes the trilogy is inevitable; how much deeper can Nolan dig? It lacks the near-perfection of ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), it needs more clarity and a better villain, but it's an honorable finale. The actual location is in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India, and we get a glimpse of some zigzagging stairs that are unforgettably shown in ""Baraka."" Turns out Bane was held there as a child.",

Before The Dark Knight all of us used to watch super hero movies and consider them the kind of thing that would never happen in real life but things changed after the epic clash between batman and the Joker, The Dark Knight Rises even make it more reasonable it makes you think that if there was a batman he would be exactly like this. and it is being proved in each scene as you go through the movie, how hard it is to live with the cruelty of bane, how it is really hard to find weapons and devices to use that they use everything they got (unlike other action movies that everyone suddenly have a 100 gun when it is time to fight) it is like what would really happen if Bane came to your city and Batman was to defend it. in other words you can call this movie a masterpiece,if you didn't watch it yet then what are you waiting for?",
127,21 July 2012,ragingbull_2005,6, Over Promises and Under Delivers,"The disappointment of the year. could not imagine the duo of nolan brothers getting it wrong. this movie should have been titled "" Cat woman and Bane"" because Batman is just an impotent shadow of his old time over here. Cat woman aka Selina Kyle is given the major amount of the screen time and Hathway is a pretty competent Catwoman. Bane(Tom Hardy) is unfortunately all masked up so he can convey the menace only from the way he walks or talks in that Irish lilt. Michael Caine is excellent in the scenes he is in and so is Morgan Freeman. Marion cotillard is totally wasted. i could not really understand the necessity for her character in the movie and also could not fathom why an Oscar winning actor like her would go for such a two bit role. Joseph Gordon Lewitt creases his forehead throughout the movie and that is pretty much all he does. Christian Bale is above average but he cannot lift a screenplay which is weak and predictable from the very beginning. the only bright spot about the movie is its music which is better than the previous installments. This movie is a disappointment when considered in seclusion. when compared with The Dark Knight and Batman Begins, it is a f**king disaster. very very unhappy.",
128,1 November 2012,maik-spranger,5, An Absolutely overrated Movie!!,"There is not much to say about TDKR, because after some days there is not much left in my movie-loving-mind. Not much except this: a disappointing villain, who is beaten in a fist-fight (!!!) and without any cool action which wasn't shown already in the trailer ... a batman who was once struggling about his gone love-of-a-lifetime Rachel but bangs now two girls in a row ... a main villain who suddenly plops out after bane is dead but acts just some minutes as head of the bad ... and a foreseeable average climax with an atomic bomb (how creative is that???). Where was the epic conclusion? where was Batmans inspiration to the people (not just Blake), were was Alfred??? TDKR is technically well done. But thats it. Don't be stupid and let cheat you by that!

So I tried to go into watching this film with an open mind and I got to say I won't question Chris Nolan's casting, direction or choice of characters again anytime soon. The man is a master and did a masterful job in this third installment of the Batman saga. Bane is an enemy in which Batman has not yet seen, he's physically strong sure but his genius and ruthlessness is truly what's terrifying. He breaks Batman time and again until you almost question whether Batman can really beat him in the end (which is saying something, because we all know he has to right?). The choices of the other actors like Anne Hathaway were spot on, she was magnificent and nailed the cat women character this movie required to succeed. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Christian Bale were their own usual selves (exceptional) and I really didn't see anyone miscast or turn in anything other then a very strong performance. Overall this movie left me completely happy, the perfect ending to the perfect movie saga. These are not just great super hero movies, to me they're great films period.",
130,9 March 2014,dromasca,5, heavy and over-rated,"'Batman' series and in general the super-hero movies are supposed to be popular entertainment. Their 'literary sources' if they can be named so are in the comics books enjoyed by the kids and teenagers of the 30s and 40s which grew older and did not really know to much other literature, and then passed the same taste for direct action, plots that many time passed the border of the credible and 'deux-ex-machina' solutions of the story involving in most cases the super-heroes with their super-powers. After a first generation of movies building the premises of their success from the visual effects that tried to equate the thrills on the printed paper later productions emphasized other aspects of the story - like the romantic aspects (the 'Lois and Clark' TV series that I enjoyed greatly) or the growing pains of the hero on his path to become a reluctant superhero.",

134,27 December 2012,bennyhagen,1," Lazy, joyless, unimaginative - Nolan.","I'm sorry people of the world, but apparently my finger is so not on your collective pulse. When it comes to anything besides making something look expensive, Nolan fails utterly and this movie is his coup de grâce on the importance of intelligent scriptwriting. Overtaking the god-awful Inception and the frustratingly dumb Prometheus, the worst written script of all time that received a 9 digit funding is now this mindlessly bashed together piece of what would be used as toilet paper for a week obligatorily worldwide in any universe which I am the ruler of. After I wrote a stupid essay on the previous installment - that now appears like art-house to me - blaming the movie for the rising popularity of pseudo-intellectualism in mainstream cinema, I have to stand in awe as where Nolan was at least just a pretentious, talentless prick with rich friends he now is a lazy pretentious, talentless prick with rich friends. My god, he was a horrible, infantile scriptwriter so far, but now he just doesn't seem to even give a rat's ass about it anymore. Was it lack of inspiration? A creative dilemma? Did he watch his former movies? I don't know. Nolan's basic lack of ability to efficiently pace the happenings of his movies, progress his stories trough anything but his South-American soap-opera style, exposition-only dialog, his disregard that his protagonist is a pathetic, mumbling, repulsive, shallow dick with nothing to go for, who looks like sh*t in his stupid costume and fights worse then I do, his psychopathic addiction to mindless, melodramatic bullsh*t sum up to one of the lowest quality, most embarrassing blockbusters I have seen in my whole life. I've spent the last 15 years ranting about action movies ruined by stupid comic relief and stereotypical crap, but not even the writers of Independence Day allowed themselves the thoughtless disregard of everything that is the art of movie-making at the degree Christopher Nolan dares putting forward. If there is a labour union responsible for QA in modern cinema, I demand Nolan be shot to the moon or deported back to filmschool with an F- before he can do more damage then he already has done.",
135,20 July 2012,morphion2,8, Flawed but Unbroken - A Fitting Finale,"Following a movie event like Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) is a dangerous game, but then Nolan is a dangerous player. His curious obsession with masculine identity, psychological schisms and the dark night of the soul gave ""Batman Begins"" (2005) a sense of edgy 'reality' that ingratiated him to critics and a good deal of the public, even if it alienated some hard-core Batfans with its customized and highly Nolan-esque take on the Caped Crusader. When his second installment braved the frontier of openly post-9/11 superhero parables, and in so doing gave the late Heath Ledger platform to truly wow audiences and critics the world over, the British director seemed to have galvanized 'superhero noir' as the new benchmark in comic book film adaptation. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012) is his final word on the subject, and while this reviewer feels that it is not a film fit to win over any dissenters or greatly deter any fanatics, it is very largely successful in what it tries to do and its failings are certainly not for a lack of trying.",
136,17 August 2012,sam_l_kay,5, Disappointing,"I fail to see how this film is so highly rated, the film bored me to death, it seemed like over half the film was slow, tedious buildup revealing how Wayne became isolated from the outside world after taking the fall for Dents death, and although this was done well, the film failed to grab my attention throughout. The film introduced a set of new characters such as Blake and Foley but it failed to develop the characters and I felt no attachment to them. As for Bane, the main villain in the film, the character was incredibly false, the characters crippling mask led to there being a voice-over for Bane, which took away from any atmosphere, it just felt like Bane was speaking via a recording studio, no matter where the location, the voice never changed in volume or acoustics. As for Catwoman there was nothing sexy about the character, every kiss was done when the camera was at the back of a characters head, blocking the kiss itself, there was no sexy combat either, as done in other Movies and Video Games, the sexiest she got was trapping a villains hand with her high heel but that was it. It seemed like she was just thrown in a cheap attempt to boost interest/paying customers, but there was no reward When it came to acting Christian Bale did a great job, however even his aggressive Batman voice seemed half-hearted, Oldman, Hathaway and Gordon-Levitt gave good performance but with 50% of Banes face covered by metal and leather its difficult to say Tom Hardy did a good job. However, the real star of the film was Michael Caine, he had a number of emotional scenes and delivered brilliantly where he held back tears and struggled for words and made me appreciate the genius he has. There weren't that many graphics in the film apart from a few gadgets (in which there were only one or two) and some random explosions (believe me, the scene in the baseball stadium in the advert is as good as it gets) If you are reading this and thinking, how can I say these things, look back at The Dark Knight, compare the acting, villain and tension from that film with this one and you should understand what I mean, I felt more under threat when watching Heath Ledgers Joker than Tom Hardys Bane *Slight spoiler* (not even a cameo from Liam Neeson could save DKR)",
137,4 September 2012,JohnWelles,7," A Flawed, Disappointing End to the Trilogy","""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012) is the third and final film in Christopher Nolan's trilogy about the comic book superhero Batman, created in 1939 by Bill Finger and Bob Kane. The franchise, starting in 2005 with ""Batman Begins"" and continuing in ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) is brought to a conclusion, and traditional Hollywood thinking is used by the Warner Bros. Studio here: everything is bigger, louder and more explosive and with higher stakes than before. Yet this expansionism hasn't translated into greater quality; if anything, it is the most flawed of the trio. Continuity errors, plot holes and logic defying events plague the film incessantly. The screenplay, by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, feels like it is two or three drafts away from being a finished product. Geopolitical significance is constantly strived for, especially in the latter part of the film, yet it fails to fully grasp its own half-articulated ideas and ends feeling like the pat, smug ""safe"" hawkish ideologies of a studio executive more interested in profit margins than ideas. All these mistakes are a repetition of the previous entry in the series; in many ways this perfectly encapsulates Hollywood: nothing forgotten, nothing learnt.",

139,18 April 2020,Timbo_Watching,7, A good ending to a great trilogy,"So let me start out with the negatives. This film was the least great of the three in my opinion. It had some major plot holes and confusion at the ending. But that's also something that made it great, because it is an ending that could be interpreted in different ways. So in one way, it could not be seen as a major plot hole although it has in my book. Anywho, the main antagonist Bane is one of my favorites. Find out in the film to see why, because it sure took me by a bit of surprise. On the other hand, some other appearances were quite obvious to be, but still enjoyable nonetheless. In general Christopher Nolan has made an epic trilogy that surely will stay a classic over the years to follow.",
140,11 December 2012,hani_78696,9, Finally a satisfying conclusion,"I have loved the last two movies and was expecting a perfect conclusion to this epic-superhero-crime-saga. This movies is so fantastic. The new characters are well-depicted that are Bane,Catwoman,Talia and Blake a.k.a Robin. As this is Christopher Nolan's movie ,the acting is top-notch but i wanted to see more of Bane,he is good but not as Joker,anyways Tom Hardy did a great job especially physically and that nasty voice. Christian Bale is again the superhero,he is most unique. Anne Hathaway did very nice ,she looks smoking' hot kitty as the role demands. All other actors Morgan Freeman,Joseph Gordon,Gary Oldman,Michael Caine and Marion Cotillard did supported great. There are few scenes which gave us goosebumps like the one where Batman returns with the bat,and Hans Zimmer's music as always epic. but it doesn't feels perfect like the Dark Knight,maybe Heath Ledger Pulled out in that one ,but it's slightly lower that the last movie. Special effects are amazing,everything else is great and finally a satisfying conclusion.",
141,4 September 2012,nabysdad-16-363997,4, New Title: The Dark Knight Reaks!!!,"THEY CHANGED THE ENTIRE CHARACTER OF THE VILLAIN. All of the stuff that made Bain interesting, they didn't even include in the movie. The premise was idiotic. Batman fans always except that for some reason villains want to take over Gotham City, who knows why; especially since they are stuck in the late 50's with the old cars, slum neighborhood etc. But this was just dumb. First of all they really gave no reason that this would be so in this movie, they usually give us that. Then the costume Bain wore served no purpose except to make him look scary, or in this case like Hannibal Lechter. And then the complete departure from the storyline that took us out of the country for what seemed like hours in real time, before ""the Dark Knight Rises"" which everyone knew he would, and they didn't even bother to make that interesting. What they succeeded in doing with this movie was making my butt hurt because I had been sitting waaaaay too long. So if you go see it, buy the extra large popcorn, dump a gallon of butter on it, buy a hotdog, a huge soda, lots of candy, take a cushion, because you're gonna be in there for a while, waiting for what you already know is going to happen.",
142,21 July 2012,rgkarim,8, Well Fitting End To An Awesome Trilogy,"Christopher Nolan has done it again with the latest Batman movie and has found a way to finish the trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises is an action packed, dark adventure about finding redemption from past events. With sound acting from Levitt and Hatahaway, a well done version of Bane, and some high speed chases, fans will surely not be disappointed. However, for this reviewer the Dark Knight is the better movie of the two. In this movie Nolan has a tendency to make some of the characters idiots when it comes to discovering Batman's identity and a few of his dialogue montages are a poorly timed to be more ridiculous than appreciative. ",
143,31 July 2012,harryplinkett14,1, They still don't get it,"Everything that was wrong with the previous installment was carried on to this one, and amplified. In short: you can't make a film about a guy in a bat costume riding on motorcycles and beating up other cartoon characters and frame it like a Shakespeare play. Why is this film three hours long? How can a story about a guy attempting to blow up a city with a nuclear bomb and being stopped by the superhero possibly be that long? I will tell you how: through bad screen writing. There are now too many characters to keep track of and Batman again experiences a deep personal drama and an incredible spiritual journey, completely shifting the focus away from the action. And remember: this is a guy who wears tights and speaks in a hoarse voice for some reason, not bloody Hamlet. This simply doesn't work. As for that deep, hoarse voice of his, why does he use it? Apparently everyone that matters in this film already knows his identity, so what's the point? Unless of course it is a competition between him and the main villain to see who can come up with the deepest voice. Listening to a dialogue between these two is simply hilarious, in part because of the fact that the film insists on the seriousness of it all. Again: you can't be serious in a film of this sort. It becomes ridiculous. What can I say? It's a superhero movie about a guy who whines most of the time when he is on screen, and when he isn't we are forced to watch the adventures of several completely uninteresting and unimportant minor characters. Why they are in this movie is a mystery. We don't care for them and the plot can be advanced perfectly well without them. My guess is that their purpose is to make the film twice as long as it should be. And it is about twice as long as it should be, or at least one hour too long. By the time the film hit the two hour mark, I could no longer care about anything and I wanted to leave the theatre. I have a few questions, by the way: How can a little girl jump a distance that a grown man in perfect physical shape cannot jump? Why is there a TV set in an underground prison in the middle of a desert? How hard is it to fashion tools to escape from that pit? They already have long ropes, metal bars and what not. Who provides food for these prisoners, and how come it is so rich in protein for a guy to build muscles worthy of a professional athlete? Also, how does a man make his way from what appears to be the heart of Africa or Asia back to the United States with no money or passport, and then break into a zone that is under tight military surveillance? Let's just say that whole part of the plot was a waste of time, as was pretty much everything else but I really can't be bothered to explain the stupidity of this endless sequence of dull and frustrating moments that they call a 'movie'. This franchise is now completely dead and any further sequels would be pointless. Unfortunately I doubt the studio will have the decency to pull the plug on this failed concept for a superhero movie",
144,30 September 2019,heisenberg12,8, Very Underrated Action-Masterpiece,"This will be a very underrated movie due to the amazingness of The Dark Knight. However, in many ways it is just as groundbreaking, philosophical, profound, and good as its predecessor. It won't necessarily surpass the masterpiece that the Dark Knight is, but it really comes awfully close. It is its own thing, and other than a few sequences midway through and towards the end, it is every bit a masterpiece of action-filmmaking as The Dark Knight. The way Nolan handled the introduction, background, and development of the new characters was a treat and very satisfying. The only difference between this and the Dark Knight really is that the weaknesses of The Dark Knight Rises are just more pronounced. With a few scenes edited out in the middle, it would be just as good. This movie has inspirational components to it, while The Dark Knight has more morality-oriented components to it. But they both contain bits of both.",

But after repeat viewings and taking in little details from each viewing, I've found the Dark knight rises to actually be a great film that actually grows on you.

This is one of those movies you can watch multiple times and pick up different clues along the way. I do wish Morgan Freeman had a bigger role in this one. Love Lucius!

While that tragedy is hard to separate from the film, it is unfortunate because the film is very good. The film is as dark and painful to watch as the prior two, but just as good in my opinion. The events of the two prior come together and come full circle as Christian Bale's character has to deal with his past, the events he put in place, and his place in the world. Tom Hardy is excellent as Bane. The supporting cast is terrific. This, like the prior, is an adult film. It is gritty and visceral. The action is chaotic at point but very engaging. I like this story arc. I like these characters. I think the Direction and the visuals are unmatched. While I loved Tim Burton's Batman and respect it immensely nothing compares to this trilogy.

It was not only a great superhero film but a great film in general. Did they exactly need a conclusion to Batman's story? That's really not for me to decide, but they did it and in my opinion it ended in the best possible way. Not the best way, but the best possible way. This is an excellent film, it is excellent because it demonstrates everything that made the Dark Knight Trilogy complex, and because of Nolan's direction it made it even better. Christian Bale gives a fine performance as Batman, the theatrical voice is still there, but it's toned down. I could barely recognize Tom Hardy as Bane, the voice is a little much but he still does good nevertheless. I really don't get all the hate for Anne Hathaway, she's a good actress, regardless of what her ambitions might be, she did good in Les Miz but did well here. Joseph Gordon- Levitt did good as usual, and Gary Oldman Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman can do this in their sleep. The Dark Knight was what it was because it had a realism to it, this could definitely happen in real life, in regards to the Joker. The realism fades when Bane comes along but that's not a bad thing if the story is told well (and it is).

Is he the same man who direct TDK and movies like Inception & Mememto ? I cant believe it? This is way toooooo stupid & too shallow to belong to any sensible director!!! I think Nolan must had taken paycheck while some second unit was doing its shooddy job ...in 18/19century some well known writers including Alexander Dumas at times used to employ army of ""assistant writers"" who will write while they publish in their name ; are we seeing something like that? This movie , its story ..its annoying music ..hollow characters n stupid story sequences are way too irritating n too much insulting to even a donkey faced audience. If The Dark Knight was highest point in the superhero movie history , this gotta be the lowest ebb since it came from someone whom the world saw as Kubrick's Son !!!! Still cant believe those who adore the movie .....are the sarah palin types growing at such a phenomenal rates in USA? Do they even ustand what a movie is?",
168,17 February 2019,mgd_m,3, Too much,"This story has nothing to do with Batman. Batman is not about action-packed large scale wars, where he is just one of several heroes. Batman should be a one man show in a smaller context. In this way, instead, the existential drama typical of Batman is sacrificed in favor of too many distracting elements. The movie starts slowly, trying to develop a story from the ending of the previous installment, but it's not that compelling. Neither Bane is that interesting as an enemy, at the end of the day he's just the same old anarchist tyrant menacing the masses. The exotic setting of the central part of the movie is redundant, it would have been better to leave the asiatic setting of the first movie alone. On the other hand, the ending is good and the Hathaway character is also. Overall, the movie tries to reach an extent that's too much for a Batman story.",

171,4 April 2020,Abd_Elrahman_Tarek,10, Most underrated movie I've ever seen.,"In my opinion I think this is the best movie of Nolan's Batman trilogy. It's more interesting, enjoyable and emotional. The acting performance is brilliant and the cast has been chosen perfectly. The end is one of the most beautiful endings I've seen, it's phenomenal and remarkable. All things about this movie will still in my memory because it's simply a great masterpiece and I really loved it. Finally if you haven't seen this trilogy yet then I can definitely recommend it.",

173,31 December 2012,almanjit25,10, A cinematic masterpiece,"What a film! Rarely does one call a superhero flick a cinematic work of art. Well this one certainly is that and much more. It isn't a run-of-the-mill popcorn, action packed, story-less offering that many superhero films are. This one goes above and beyond. It is less about the masked man and more about the man behind the mask, a broken man fighting his own demons. A dark and emotional tale of absolution and revenge, strength and sacrifice. Anne Hathaway is brilliant as Catwoman. Its no wonder she is receiving nominations for her role in this movie and in Les Miserables. Bane i think is the highlight of this movie. His speech may go down in dialogue history. You feel mesmerized and taken aback by the sheer force of this movie. It has everything from the deepest darkest emotions to powerful confrontation scenes and a breathtaking climax. I had no idea so much time had gone by, that is how gripping this film is. Though if you prefer more violence and action, then this may not be for you. Personal opinion: It is the best film of 2012. A must see as it raises the bar for not only superhero flicks but also films in general.",
174,12 April 2020,eskimosound,10, Absolutely Brilliant...,"These Baman movies with Christian Bale are superb.
Real gritty, violent, dark, harrowing action dramas.
An excellent watch, there's no underpants showing, no comedy, no one liners, just hard hitting...hard hitting!
Truly excellent entertainment.",
175,27 May 2020,Med-Jasta,10, Saving the best for last,This is a rare movie in that the director who started it finished it. Everything that was established in Begins and then continued in the Dark Knight comes to a perfect conclusion. The greatest thing about Begins was that it established a Batman we hadn't seen before. They took a lot of things from the comics and made sense out of them while adding a whole lot more. Rises delivers on that promise by doing something Batman hasn't done in 70 years: ending.,

177,11 June 2013,Druidmaster89,10, M-a-s-t-e-r-p-i-e-c-e.,"Chris Nolan has r-e-a-l-l-y outdone himself again this time. An amazing story that I don't even know who else could write such a treatment on the World's Greatest Detective, the crowning glory of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.",
178,19 August 2012,barbalanatkinson-1,1, Worst of ALL Batman films,"As time goes by and the hype dies down and the Nolanites either grow up or move on to other agendas, this film will be seen for what it really is; a bloated, stupid, preposterous and dull entry in the cinematic adventures of The Batman. If you are looking for Batman, you will be disappointed as he is scarcely in the film. The first half is particularly dull and could have easily been edited down drastically to ease some of the pain. The pacing picks up in the second half, but unfortunately, so does the absurdity in the plot. The motivation of the villains is never explained in anywhere close to a satisfactory manner and their actions defy all logic. The ending is particularly laughable and even embarrassing to watch. Nolan fans who claim that these Batman films are somehow rooted in the real world aren't really paying attention. This film is every bit as bad as the Schumaker films, worse because this takes itself seriously. THE DARK KNIGHT probably stands as the best Batman film to date despite it's own flaws. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is the worst. I'd rather watch Adam West as Batman than this mess.",
179,9 July 2013,richardmaibes,2, Very disappointed,"The problems with this mess of a movie are endless. Mainly, it's just boring and completely unbelievable...and way too long. There's not nearly enough Batman and, when he is on screen, he mostly gets his ass kicked. Meanwhile the villains are capable of doing everything successfully. As a result, Batman just comes off as tired and lame. The movie's war scenes smack more of Iron Man than Dark Knight. The movie desperately tries to prove how bad-ass Bane is, but he's just...not. Truly, I expected a scene with Bane loading cancer surviving, crippled grandmas into a bus and blowing them up. It was that silly. All the subplots slow things down: I could care less about the backstory of the chick with the accent, Robin (gee, I didn't see that coming two hours before it happened), the corporate stuff, Alfred's blubbering. Dull, dull, dull. Lastly, the sound is amateur. Everything is pushed up front, so it's often difficult to understand dialogue. Just a disorganized mess.",

183,22 July 2012,Gianopulos,2, Dark Knight Rises? More like sinks.,I am not going to give anything away here other then the fact that this is the worst movie of the trilogy. I went into this experience so wanting this to be a great movie. I really did. Needless to say my hopes were burnt to a crisp like the first Wayne Manor.,

185,27 June 2020,Bob_647,9, A sweet conclusion to a trilogy full of power.,"Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.",

187,16 November 2012,mnoraznan,1, Disappointing: Nolan's worst movie yet.,"TDKR's 1 billion haul seems to indicate that this blockbuster is a good movie. Think again...its worst of the worst. In fact, it is on par with Bay's explosive-laden monstrosities. You would think that someone who have come up with Momento and Inception would know better... The level of acting, plot and set pieces is indicative of a B-Movie style filmmaking. ",
188,26 November 2012,p-stepien,4, Only gets worse after a re-watch,"After taking the fall for Harvey Dent's tragic demise multi-millionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale returns) turns into a semi-crippled recluse hiding out in his mansion, reducing his companionship to the faithful butler Alfred (Michael Caine). Gotham is now a city governed by the rigid Dent Act, which has cleared the streets of crime, but overfilled the prisons. With Batman now both obsolete and wanted the war on crime is seemingly won and even the hero Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) contemplates a hard earned rest, while still troubled by the Batman's sacrifice. That is until the up-and-commance of the masked mercenary Bane (Tom Hardy voiced by Sean Connery) topples the facade and awakes Wayne's past demons. Batman reemerges - together with Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) karate high-heeling and street-cop Blake (Joseph Gordon-Lewitt) as the moral fibre of the city.",
189,29 July 2012,brownish33,1, Thank the Maker that Nolan is done with Batman,"People complained about Batman not having enough screen time in 1992 with Batman Returns. well, here it is again. the big difference is that whenever batman appeared in the aforementioned film, it WAS batman, and he was cool. this is not the case with bale. i have now had to endure 2 movies that call themselves ""batman"" movies, but cmon. don't kid yourself. this is not batman. frankly i am shocked at how the sheep have latched onto Nolan's batman, particularly TDK. i don't really understand it.....what was it that people saw in that dreck i didn't see? as a big fan of the original batman films ala Tim Burton and the FIRST film by Joel Schumacher, i remember going into batman begins all starry eyed and excited to see my favorite hero on screen. needless to say, i was let down. i did read in magazines beforehand the ""realism"" approach Nolan was taking. i thought OK, it will be dark like Tim Burton's awesome movies, yeah! but.....it was boring. it dragged. the villains were lame. Ra's AL Gaul i mainly knew from the cartoon show with Kevin Conroy i grew up watching. i expected Lazarus pits. didn't get that. the bat mobile looked like a freaking tank. that just ticked me off. I'm still not over that. then came the dark knight. i didn't expect much, given how incredibly lame batman begins was. and i wasn't crazy about the casting of heath ledger as joker. last person in the world i would have cast to play him. ah well, i decided to give it a try, plus the hype was incredible due to ledgers death. it turned out that was the only thing anyone could even remember about the film. its totally unmemorable, and try as i might, i could help but compare ledger to Nicholson. needless to say, ledger doesn't even come close to the genius of jack. the whole look of joker was totally off, looking like a grungy hobo. LAME. while the action is ever so slightly amped up, it never took off for me, and two-face, more like half-a-face, short cameo at the end (yes, thats really all it was) was incredibly insulting. sorry to say, tommy lee Jones still owns that part as he was a major player and played the role to the hilt.",
