0,9 January 2001,lugonian,9, The Man With Hitler's Face,"""The Great Dictator"" (United Artists, 1940), became the long awaited talking debut of silent film comedian, Charlie Chaplin (who also wrote and directed), in a political satire on Adolph Hitler, only the way Chaplin dared to do at the time. He plays a Jewish barber and Hynkel, dictator of Tomania. Some of the humor cannot really be absorbed at first glance, but after repeated viewing, it gets better. My personal classic moment occurs with Chaplin in the barber shop working on a bald-headed customer by giving him a shave while listening to a classical composition on the radio, never missing a beat. Co-starring opposite Chaplin for the second and final time is Paulette Goddard as Hannah. Goddard became the only Chaplin leading lady to ever make a success on her own while the others just drifted to ""B"" movies or faded away. Jack Oakie as Napaloni, the Dictator of Bacteria (a spoof on Mussolini), appears late in the story but shares with Chaplin some of its brilliant comedic moments. Both Chaplin and Oakie earned Academy Award nominations for their performances (Chaplin for Best Actor/Oakie for Best Supporting Actor), but no wins. Henry Daniell as Garbitsch and Reginald Gardiner as Schultz also share the spotlight. Aside from Chaplin's screenplay in poking fun of its then current issues on European invasion by the Nazis, ""The Great Dictator"" expertly blends satire with dramatic overtones. Its closing scene in which Chaplin makes a speech pleading for all people to follow the path of peace, brotherhood and democracy, is not to be missed. Whether this movie is above or beyond the Marx Brothers' ""Duck Soup"" (Paramount, 1933) is anyone's matter of taste. (***)",/
1,3 March 2009,ma-cortes,8, Immortal classic movie with dual character for Chaplin as barber Jew and Dictator Hynkel,"This ingenious and innovate comedy packs many priceless moments and great sense of pace , though overlong . Chaplin's satire with several classic scenes , he has dual role as a Jewish barber and dictator Hynkel , an offensive portrayal of Hitler . Then the barber is mistaken for the Hitlerian tyrant and there happens bemusing events . Funny and extraordinary acting all around , as the stunning co-stars Jack Oakie as Napolini (Mussolini-alike) , Henry Daniel as Gasbstich (Himmler-alike) and Billy Gilbert as Herring (Goering) . Chaplin's first spoken film is brilliantly photographed by Karl Struss . This splendid film contains numerous amusing scenes , the funniest are the followings : 1) The one when during the WWI the barber-soldier along with a co-pilot are flying in a turned plane without to be aware 2) When Dictator Adenoid Hynkel tells overacting speeches , including a twisted microphone 3) Hynkel playing with an enormous world balloon 4) The Jew-barber shaving a man while fitting to Hungarian Dance : number 5 by Brahms 5) when Hynkel and Napolini each try to keep his body higher than other in a barber's chair , among them .",r
2,18 October 2010,Steffi_P,9," ""Can you hear that?""","Back at the dawn of the talkie era, Charlie Chaplin defended his decision not to start making sound films by saying ""The moment the little tramp talks, he's dead"". He was right of course. His comic persona was the creation of an era in cinema when words and voices were irrelevant. The little tramp's appeal lay entirely in how he did things, not in what he was supposed to be saying. And yet it was inevitable that if Chaplin wanted to continue in the business he would have to cave in eventually. Besides Chaplin's agenda was itself changing, and he had now reached a point in his life where he really wanted to speak to the world.",e

It's a hilarious political satire, but it also delivers a vitally important message. This film was released at the time when Hitler was at the height of his power and the main character, dictator Hynkel, is obviously a reference to him.",i

6,19 May 2013,slokes,7, First Laughs And Last Laughs,"Charlie Chaplin's boldest film for its willingness to take on Adolf Hitler before nearly anyone else, ""The Great Dictator"" was also Chaplin taking on sound 11 years after everyone else.

7,23 January 2005,muzikla,10, We think too much and feel too little.,"I was surprised and impressed to find out this movie was released in 1940, before the United States entered World War II. On the surface, satirizing something as solemn and horrible as Nazi Germany could be misconstrued as rash. But Chaplin's brilliance isn't limited to making a joke out of everything. In fact, the seriousness of his message wouldn't have been nearly as valid if not for the excellent use of humor in this movie along with the moments of stark drama blended in. Drama alone wouldn't have had the bite and resonance that this film did. Laughing at someone (Adenoid Hynkel) can be the best way to attack them, while laughing with someone (the Jewish Barber) can be the best way to love them. In the Jewish Barber's final speech, I forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago. They are words that have meaning now, and in any time of war. For this reason I believe the film did far greater good than harm, as it still has the same profound effect today.",/
8,29 October 2001,Kakueke,10, Masterpiece,"The Great Dictator is a beyond-excellent film.  Charlie Chaplin succeeds in being both extremely funny and witty and yet at the same time provides a strong statement in his satire against fascism.  The anti-Nazi speech by Chaplin at the end, with its values, is one of filmdom's great moments. Throughout this movie, I sensed there was some higher form of intelligence, beyond genuinely intelligent filmmaking, at work.",r
9,30 November 2010,bkoganbing,10, The Tramp Finally Speaks,Charlie Chaplin certainly put off speaking on cinema long enough. His bread and butter was made with his little tramp character on the silent screen. But when Chaplin finally did speak he spoke some of the most memorable prose ever spoken on the cinema. The eloquence of his appeal for universal brotherhood is maybe more relevant today than even back in 1940 when he decided to satirize Nazi Germany in The Great Dictator.,w
10,6 March 2004,barrysheene,9, Remember that......,"..this movie has been done when Hitler ( and Mussolini who is as well in the movie) was at the top and many politics and even the Roman Church used to close eyes about brutality and evil of Nazism. Especially in USA there were many people who had not understood what was really going on in Germany and Europe ( Charles Lindenbergh for example ).It would be as today a big actor would made a parody of Berlusconi or Chirac. Chaplin maybe made a lot of mistakes in his life, but this is really a masterpiece of humanity and IMHO a great demonstration he was a courageous man. The movie is funny and deep, the final speech has a terrible strength and is still updated. I think this movie is one of the best ever done.",0

13,27 April 2017,Leofwine_draca,7, Well-regarded for a reason,"THE GREAT DICTATOR is well-regarded as Charlie Chaplin's best movie and it's easy to see why. This is the film in which he mercilessly satirises Adolf Hitler, then at the peak of his ascendancy, while also exploring the persecution of the Jews under the Nazi regime. It's all disguised as another country and regime but we know it's Hitler that Chaplin is taking the mickey out of. It's a broad, character-based comedy all right, but deals with huge and pressing themes, and Chaplin deserves kudos for being the little man who stood up to a tyrant.",1
14,7 July 2005,lee_eisenberg,10, ...und de movies und de...,"I would say that ""The Great Dictator"" is Charlie Chaplin's best movie ever. Mainly a spoof of Hitler, but also reminding us about tyranny in any form, the movie was Chaplin's first talkie. Probably the funniest aspect is his mockery of German: dictator Adenoid Hynkel stands up on the podium and rants something that sounds like: ""Eh, de Holstein und de Aryan maiden und de strangulation itten. Kapeet! Kapatt! Deutsch Juden...grrr deutsch Juden!"" Another great scene is when he's arguing with the Mussolini character about the Ostralich border, and their argument almost turns into a catfight.",7
15,2 January 2021,Hitchcoc,10, Almost Too Much to Take In,"I hadn't watched a Charlie Chaplin movie for ages. I'd seen this a long time ago. I resurrected my admiration for the guy. First of all, the pure physical comedy is phenomenal. The choreographed fight scenes are priceless. Then there is his persona as a variant of the little tramp, this time as a Jewish barber who has had amnesia for twenty years. But the courageous parody portrayal of the disgusting figures of World War II is great. It it weren't so tragic it would be even funnier. Just the names of the figures alone are great. Paulette Godard is really fun and has a strong female voice. It's a terrific film in every aspect.",7

Chaplin has the dual role of a Hitler-like dictator, Adenoid Hynkel (""Hail, Hynkel"") (all the countries are fictional, and the party logo is one X on top of another) and also a war veteran, a sweet barber who looks like Hynkel. There are some truly hilarious parts of this film as well as some truly dramatic ones. The barber trying to keep from falling out of a plane is just one; the nonsense German Hynkel speaks; the barber shaving one customer in time with the music, playing to Chaplin's silent film strengths; Hynkel's dancing with his world globe, which is really a huge balloon.",2

19,19 May 2019,minister_of_silly_walks,10, The icon of comedy finally speaks!,"To call ""The Great Dictator"" an excellent film would be an understatement. It is one of the masterpieces of classic cinema brought to us by a Hollywood pioneer and one of the most beloved people of the 20th century. It is a satire of Nazi Germany released in the height of their power and the invasion of Europe. A slap in the face of tyranny and bloodthirsty rulers all across the globe, but particularly aimed at Nazi Germany. Even thought it has such a serious theme the movie is still filled to the brim with laughs and shenanigans that can only be delivered by Chaplin. It shows you the absurdness of fascism and Nazism by openly lampooning its philosophy and its leaders, but also it has a subtle message of terror showing us what happens when such people get in place of power. It all culminates with one of the most iconic speeches in cinematic history that resounds with people all around the globe to this day. A must watch for any fan of comedy, history and cinema!",r
20,16 September 2000,zetes,8, Pretty good Chaplin film with extraordinarily powerful final moments,"I once caught about a 20 minute portion of this movie on Turner Classic Movies about 6 months back. I thought every minute of what I was watching was gold, and, because it was somewhere in the film's middle and I didn't want to spoil the whole thing if I were to watch it from the start, I decided that I would rent it immediately. Well, the video store which I frequent did not have a copy, so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it. I had previous to that experience only seen some Chaplin shorts, funny but not greatly artful, but after I saw the snippet of The Great Dictator, I checked out three of his other films, City Lights, The Gold Rush, and Modern Times (City Lights was great, I found the Gold Rush a little overrated, but still worthwhile, and I found Modern Times to be one of the funniest films I've ever seen (second funniest, behind Keaton's Sherlock Jr., more exactly).",e

It should be noted that Hitler was an admirer of Chaplin's work, to the point of copying his mustache. I doubt that it continued after this film, but we will never know.",f
22,12 April 2005,ElenaP-3,10, Probably Chaplin's Most Powerful Film,"Here we have the inimitable Charlie Chaplin forsaking his slapstick past to tackle the serious subject of anti-Semitism, and intolerance in general. He portrays two characters - the sweet, innocent Jewish barber - a war veteran, and the raving and ruthless dictator, Adenoid Hynkel. The Jewish ghetto in this country is not safe for long, due to the whims of Hynkel and his armed thugs, who routinely rough up its residents, or leave them alone, dependent upon his mood that day or week. The barber is among them, but is befriended by his former commanding officer, Schultz (Reginald Gardner), who seems to keep things quiet for a while, until Hynkel condemns him to a concentration camp. He seeks refuge with the Jews in the ghetto, most specifically the barber, and the feisty young woman, Hannah (Paulette Goddard). The premise will be - who will be the one among these Jews to put their lives on the line to get rid of Hynkel and his cronies? We needn't guess too hard to know the answer; the barber is a dead ringer for the dictator, and he is outfitted in his image, accompanied by Schultz, also in full military gear. Hannah escapes with several of her ghetto friends to the country of Osterlich, where Mr Jaeckel's (Maurice Moscovich) cousin has a farm, and they can live peaceably for a while. At this point, Hynkel himself has been arrested by his armed forces, thinking him to be the notorious barber. The latter, meanwhile, has been escorted with Schultz to a podium, to make a speech announcing the conquest of Osterlich. The ensuing ten minutes is pure Chaplin himself, speaking from his heart of tolerance, love and freedom, and denigrating greed and hatred. Albeit Chaplin started production on the film in 1937, it can be forgiven some naivete. He was allegedly unaware of the gravity of this persecution and hatred, and said had he known the full extent, he would never have made the film, because he most likely believed it would have trivialized the situation. He has a marvelous supporting cast: Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniell as Garbitsch, his aide-de-camp, the always wonderful Billy Gilbert as the bumbling Herring, Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie as the dictator Napaloni, his rival for conquest, veteran European actors David Gorcey (Leo's father), Maurice Moscovich, among others. The scene he choreographed with globe, with just a musical accompaniment is sheer, luminous inspiration, and luminous, as well, is Paulette Goddard at the film's end, smiling through her tears. I have seen this film before, but there is always something new in it for me. Last evening, when it finished, I sat there in tears. I defy anyone not to be moved by it.",_

24,22 December 2003,Platymania,9," A film of its time, without a modern equal","This film entered production before WW2 began, but was not released until it was well under way. With significant fascist-sympathy in the US, and Chaplin himself being suspected as a communist sympathiser, The Great Dictator was a very courageous endeavour. Such risks in film-making - thinly veiled political statements - would be almost inconceivable today. Imagine the fallout if someone were to make an equally satirical film today which criticised the USA's foreign policy?",t
25,15 July 2016,pere-25366,10, Satire perfectly juxtaposed with drama,"The Great Dictator is an exceptional film that sees Chaplin shine in a dual role. The only shred of resemblance shared by these two protagonists is their appearance, which plays out in a very clever manner as the film progresses. The satirical manner in which Chaplin carries out Hynkel's oratory is comedy at its finest. Seamlessly blending both comical ingenuity and serious subject matter, The Great Dictator is a hilarious and pensive film produced to perfection. The now famous anti-Nazi speech given at the end is nothing short of mesmerizing. Making an impassioned plea for brotherhood and goodwill, Chaplin deliver's one of the most introspective speeches in cinema history. Chaplin's first true sound film more than stands the test of time after almost 80 years and is quite simply one of the most magnificent films ever crafted.",t
26,31 May 2004,stamper,6," Ballsy, cinematic milestone, that isn't nearly as good as it's rep","The main thing that bothered me in The Great Dictator, is that it is too lengthy for what it's supposed to be. There just isn't an intriguing story here (or one that should be spread out as long as it has). I know this film is supposed to be a spoof of Hitler, but it fails at that, because there are just a few comic scenes that could have easily been put in a 20 minute feature (this would have stopped the repeating of several funny' or should I say tiresome gags as well). I hear you say though: but there STILL is a love story. Well sorry mates, that one is quite a bummer as well, because there are no real emotions there and the viewer is not shown how the barber and Hannah fall in love, you just have to assume it was love at first sight. The ending is NOT at all original and the final words that hit the viewer, just before the lights go out are understandably a bit idealistic (which makes them seem a bit cheesy now). But remember, back in 1940 people all over the world didn't yet know what was happening in Germany and they still though worse things might be prevented. In conclusion, I must say that I admire Chaplin's craftsmanship and his guts to make this film, yet I also feel a bit bewildered why this ranks so high in IMDB's top 250. Maybe it's the intention or the idea behind the film. All I can say is, that watched out of it's original context in the 21st century, this film comes off way worse than other things I've seen by Chaplin. It's just not funny, too unemotional and too long to be good.",_

28,1 December 2003,coco007,10, F***ing fantastic,"Before I saw this film I didn't really expect to much from it, although my friend advised otherwise. Due to this request from my friend I decided I was really going to watch this film. The minute I sat down to view the film I was absolutely blown away. From the credits I was falling of my seat; I just couldn't contain myself. The film is about Hitler in all the glory of comedy. Hynkel is the absolute double for the Jewish Barber, who comes back from fighting in the war. Due to the heroics of the barber, he manages to save one of the germans and by doing that gets a member of the enemy on board, which helps in the struggle which the jews had. But things went wrong and Stolz was arrested, but only then to escape to the confines of the Jewish surburb, 'The Ghetto'. Due to this escape, the german army began searching which meant that the Barber and Stolz got arrested but again they escaped, only to be mistaken for hynkel and consequently takes his poistion. *****THE SPEECH THAT CHAPLIN MAKES AT THE END IS FANTASTIC, IT COMPLIES THE MORALS WHICH SOCIETY COULD ONLY DREAM ABOUT. IN THE SPEECH IT CONTRADICTS THE WHOLE MEANING OF THE FILM BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUNESS AND SINCERENITY WHICH IT ENTAILED, AND IT DEFINATELY WORKS, BECAUSE I DID WALK OUT FEELING GUILTY ABOUT HOW WE LIVE OUR LIVES, LOOKING AT THE SMALLEST THING SUCH AS BEING IGNORANT TO SOMEONE TO THE BIGGEST, MOST PROMINENT THINGS SUCH AS WAR.",r

30,22 February 2009,Sandcooler,9," Hitler gets burned, so to speak","This satire is just really, really dead-on, and nobody is spared. But even though this movie has plenty of laughs within the silly story and the grotesque imitation of Hitler (here cleverly renamed as ""Hynkel"", and speaking in a hilarious kind of pseudo-German), the general tone is pretty sad, maybe because of the movie's place in history. And the actors aren't even exaggerating that much I suppose. One of the greatest movie moments of all time must be the Jewish barber's ending speech, if only things could have ended in that way. It's not even really the character talking anymore, it's Chaplin saying something he really wanted to say. If you ignore the technical aspects, the movie doesn't feel dated or old, it actually moves at a pretty nice pace. And the sharp humor we find everywhere in this work will never die, the only thing I don't care for is the slapstick, but that just comes with the era I suppose. This is an incredibly daring, harsh take on fascism, it's so hard-hitting still after all these years.",
31,7 May 2006,planktonrules,8, very good but uneven,"This was Charlie Chaplin's first all-talking film.

32,11 November 2008,CitizenCaine,9, Great Dictator Great Parody,"With the Nazi rise to power in Eastern Europe in the late 1930's, Charles Chaplin turned his attention to creating a reaction to it. The catalyst may well have been a propaganda publication referring to Chaplin as a Jewish sympathizer. In The Great Dictator, Chaplin created a dead-on parody of Hitler that is as funny as it is frightening at times. The film traces Hitler's experiences in the German army from World War I up to the present day. Simultaneously, Chaplin plays a Jewish barber who dresses like the tramp who comes out of a hospital after a long long time, only to discover how different the world is under Nazi rule.",
33,14 February 2006,evanston_dad,10, Chaplin's Plea for Peace,"I know many people prefer Charlie Chaplin when he's silent, but I have to rank this as my favorite Chaplin film, sound and all. This is one of those movies chock full of one memorable scene after another: Chaplin's hapless soldier trying to load and fire a giant gun; his goofy dictator cavorting with an inflatable beach ball designed to look like a globe of the world; his gentle barber trying to give a member of the Gestapo a shave. I've heard that Chaplin was put on Hitler's death list as a result of this film; I don't know whether that's true or not, but if he was I'm not surprised. I can't even imagine the guts it took to make a film that so obviously mocked such a scary historical figure. In a time when comedians mock our world leaders left and right, it's easy to forget that there were times (and still places today) when doing so could get you killed.",

37,11 October 2014,ofpsmith,10, Charlie Chaplin's first sound movie turns out to be his best.,"Charlie Chaplin makes blatant fun of Adolf Hitler by parodying his Nazi Regime and expressing how he personally felt about it. Chaplin included aspects of anti-Semitism, and Hitler's invasion of Austria. Chaplin stars as two characters. Adenoid Hynkel the dictator of Tomania and an unnamed Jewish barber. There are also parodies of Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Goring in Garbitsch (Henry Daniell) and Herring (Billy Gilbert). It also satirizes Benito Mussolini with a character named Benzino Napolani (Jack Oakie). The things I love most about this movie are the situations between Hynkel and the people that work for him. Because to me there is nothing funnier than a powerful guy who is a complete idiot. It's even funnier when you look at the fact that it represents Hitler. Chaplin is replacing a formidable leader, with a pathetic dweeb in the same role. Hynkel steals the show in every scene he's in. In particular the scene with Hynkel and the globe and the scene where Hynkel is giving a speech in fake German. Go check this one out.",
38,25 May 2021,nickenchuggets,10, Chaplin mocks the monstrous,"People who lived when world war II was going on found ways to make light of it, and one way of doing that was to make a film. When Hitler became chancellor in 1933 and showed his newfound military might to the world, many were scared of him. Others mocked him. Charlie Chaplin, in many ways, can be considered the direct antithesis to Hitler. Both had a huge amount of followers, both were born in April of 1889, and even their mustaches were the same, but the similarities end there. Chaplin was going to distance himself as far away as possible from Hitler by making fun of him in one of the most well known parodies of all time. The movie starts with the first world war, where a soldier played by Chaplin is fighting for the country of Tomania, a satirical take on Germany. After hitching a ride on a plane with a pilot named Schultz, it crashes and they are informed their country has lost the war. 20 years later, Chaplin (who has amnesia) leaves the hospital and returns to being a barber. Meanwhile, the ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel (also played by Chaplin) is now the leader of Tomania. As you're watching this, it occurs to you that Hitler isn't the only nazi parodied by the actors in the movie. Reichsminister Goebbels has become Herr Garbitsch, and Goring, head of the German air force, is now Herring. Schultz later on tries to get a family to kill Hynkel which draws the suspicion of his soldiers, and he is punished by being sent away. Also, a hilarious parody of Mussolini makes an appearance: Benzino Napaloni, who is the dictator of Bacteria. He tries to make a plan with Hynkel about invading Osterlich, but they only quarrel at first. The two men eventually sign a treaty which allows the invasion to commence. Toward the end, the barber played by Chaplin impersonates Hynkel and gives a speech saying people should be nice to each other and not have aggressive attitudes. In all, this is probably one of the most well known satire movies ever, and it is a prime example of how people who lived in the same time as Hitler turned him into a joke in order to make him seem less evil. I must also mention how Chaplin watched clips of Hitler speeches for this movie so he could imitate his speech pattern.",

40,7 July 2013,DarthVoorhees,10, The Tramp takes down a tyrant...,"Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' is a masterpiece whose only fault is that even Chaplin could not imagine the horrors Adolf Hitler was capable of. It is a very funny film about the darkest horrors of modern history. Chaplin was a comedic genius and 'The Great Dictator' is in my humble opinion, his finest hour. There is no greater creative feat than to take the powerful oppressor and strip him of all his power through art. Chaplin's take on Hitler strips him of all his power. The greater clown was and always will be Adolf Hitler for his reprehensible evil views which Chaplin shows through his humor were incredibly stupid as well.",
41,7 June 2006,Quinoa1984,10, plenty of laughs around some rougher moments- comic masterpiece of the year,"The Great Dictator came out at a time when it was riskiest, as on the brink of war a statement of the inaneness shifted n nuttiness of fascism, just shows how Chaplin had practically nothing to fear as an artist. That he is also able to incorporate a version of his usual tramp character into the mix, as a kind of general symbol (if that) of the ordinary shlub suddenly and madly under the gun, is part of the film's major appeal. Going back and forth between the styles of the film are tricky as well, as Chaplin's humor is similar but varying with the two sides of his characters. His Hynkel, the mad dictator of Tomania, is one of Chaplin's most inspired creations for himself, as he sputters off in a perfected gibberish/slant on the German-hate speech with many of the gags coming off. Some of these, ironically for the silent-film legend, are through the dialog pieces in his speeches and in the sometimes volatile and always nuanced (in the over-the-top way)with his underlings. Other bits just come from the way Chaplin's facial expressions go here to there- though his physical way of comedy isn't as strong as the other character he plays (aside from the appropriately iconic globe-tossing symbolism).",

43,20 August 2016,bscrivener-50810,9, Chaplin delivers one of the most inspiring speeches of all time and uses his voice as a weapon in his first 'talkie' film.,"In his very first 'talkie' film. Charlie Chaplin proves as he did with his silent work to be impressive and inspirational in this now classic comedy/drama parodying the events leading up to and during the Second World War. The film opens with a Jewish soldier fighting on a fictionalised version of the Western Front for the nation of Tomania. After a near-fatal plane crash, the barber loses his memory and spends twenty years recovering in a hospital, during the same time his country and people are undergoing a radical revolution in the name of a new dictator named Adenoid Hynkel. Considered taboo and even downright dangerous at the time, The Great Dictator shows Chaplin to be more than just an outstanding actor and comedian, but a remorseful and courageous human being standing up to the real world troubles at the time and using his voice as a weapon. This is not just apparent in the beautiful and unifying speech that Chaplin delivers in the third act, but in his depiction of dictators and corrupt rulers. The film will have you laughing, cheering and even crying by the soul-touching finale, which challenges the very concept of human nature and the slow demise of mankind. While Chaplin may have come to pass, his legacy has well and truly lived on in what some consider his finest work. The only minor flaws are a lack of a real soundtrack that could have boosted the emotion, especially in the more serious scenes and some recurring gags that loose their comedic value by the end. 9/10",

He plays both the Jewish barber and the leader of the Germans. There are some very witty moments in this latter role, such as his dance with with an inflated globe, but too much verbal ethnic humor (of the low vaudeville type) is not alleviated by a sufficient amount of slapstick violence.  Also, the plot's fluctuations between the two characters' stories becomes disconcerting and makes the film unfocused.

I'm not the biggest fan of hers but she is admittedly endearing in this picture and will likely win over most viewers like she did me. Excellent support from Jack Oakie, Henry Daniell, Reginald Gardiner, and many more. It's a funny movie but not a knee-slapper.

I believe that he himself had a clear intuition that something would dissipate were he to switch to talking films. This is not to say that he did not produce wonderful ""talkie"" films. He did and The Great Dictator (TGD) is one of his best. Perhaps his greatest film, ""Modern Times"" has a bit of speaking in it and of course his wonderful impromptu song filled with gibberish words. We don't think of this as a ""talking"" film in the same way that TGD is; this was his first all talking film. I still prefer the silent films for several reasons. His true genius lay in suggestions brought about ONLY by facial expression. He had no peer who could evoke what his face could; remember that Keaton was known as 'stone face' and never, ever broke his facial expression, no matter what. Chaplin's silent evocations also relied on incredible physical agility and body humor that is still hilarious today.",

That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible - Jew, Gentile, Black man (or) White. We all want to help one other, humans beings are like that. We want to live by one other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to despise and hate one another; In this world, there is room for everyone - The Good Earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful. 
But we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned Men's souls, has barricaded the world with hatred, has goose-stepped the world into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed but have shut ourselves in, machinery that gives abundance has left us in want, our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind, we think too much and feel too little. 
More than machinery, we need humanity, more than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness; without these qualities life would be violent and all will be lost. The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together, the very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now, my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.
To Those who can hear me I say, ""Do not despair"". The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass and dictators die. The Power they took from the people shall return to the people and so long as Men die, Liberty shall never perish.
Soldiers, don't give yourselves in to brutes. Men who despise you, enslave you, regiment your lives - tell you what to do, what to think, what to feel; who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you like cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machine, you are not cattle, you are Men. You have the love of humanity in your hearts, you don't hate - only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers, don't fight for slavery. Fight for Liberty. In the seventeenth chapter of St. Luke it is written, ""The Kingdom of God is within Man, not one man or within a group of men but in all men. In You, you the people have the power - the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of Democracy, let us use that power, let us all unite, let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future of old age and security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie, they do not fulfill their promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfill that promise, to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness. Soldiers, in the name of democracy, Let Us All Unite!""",

One of the iconic scenes has Chaplin playing with a gas-filled globe, as he contemplates world domination.

It is the story of Adenoid Hynkel and a Jewish barber. One aspires to take over the world, while the other just wants to live his life free of oppression. It is to Charlie Chaplin's credit that this film is able to speak to the human heart in such a moving way, which is what it's all about. Charlie Chaplin gives two excellent performances as the dictator, Adenoid Hynkel, and a Jewish barber. Both roles give him an opportunity to display the physical comedy which he was already so famous for. He also gets a lot of laughs by ranting in pseudo-German. The rest of the cast also do well in their roles, particularly the actor who played Benzino Napaloni (a parody of Mussolini). There was also some great cinematography and set design. The only minor thing I felt was wrong was the opening sequence, which I felt dragged on a little too long. Still, it was a nice throwback to Chaplin's previous silent movies and had some nice sight gags (really, there was quite a number of hilarious sight gags throughout).

68,18 June 2020,tera1724,10, An Eternal Message For All Generations,"Despite being released in 1940, this incredible movie highlights the importance of human values. It is true that it was in the context of what historically happened. But more importantly, it discusses subjects and problems that all humanity will face eternally because of the human nature; which makes it relatable to any generation, on a bigger or smaller scale.
The fact that the movie is in black and white, in my opinion, is oddly undisturbing, as it reinforces its historical value; that movies in colors would not be the same.
At last, this piece of art is undeniably one of Chaplin's most successful productions, bringing any viewer to tears at the end of the most iconic speech. The music is lifting, adequate, the acting perfect as the actors barely needed to act -it seemed so real- ; all that topped with Chaplin's personal touch of satiric comedy, artistic intelligence, and melancholic nature.

69,17 July 2011,classicalsteve,10, The Tramp Comes of Age: Chaplin's Crowning Masterpiece of Comedy and Political Satire,"Most of Chaplin's silent film efforts were whimsical slap-stick comedies with slight undertones of social satire: booting the rear of an immigrant official, escaping the clutches of fool-hardy police, or being trapped inside a mechanized factory. The Tramp, the first iconic figure of the new medium of film/cinema, was the nameless but lovable immigrant, not knowing quite where he fit in. Always on the periphery of the establishment but ultimately of a kindly and innocent nature, the Tramp was endeared by audiences across America and Europe. For those coming to Ellis Island for the first time to forge new lives in a America, Chaplin's comedy probably reflected their grappling with this alien world. But on the surface, the main point was always entertainment, mostly comedic and occasionally sentimental but never biting. And then, Chaplin fused both comedy and political/social commentary into a film which really does make quite a political point.",

77,10 April 2010,pyrocitor,8," ""Any resemblance between Hynkel the dictator and the Jewish barber is purely coincidental""","""Desperate times calls for desperate measures"" goes the saying, so it is fitting that the second world war and its concentration of some of the most inhumane atrocities in human history yielded one of cinema's most overt and audacious political satires as response. The roots of legendary comic mastermind Charlie Chaplin's decision to lampoon looming Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler allegedly stemmed from his outraged discovery that Hitler had imitated Chaplin's own 'Little Tramp' moustache for the sake of acquiring an iconic image, provoking Chaplin to ridicule Hitler's own image in the same way he felt his own had been defiled - a fascinating case of art imitating life imitating art. And one cannot overstate the role of Chaplin's The Great Dictator, raising awareness of the atrocities of Nazi Germany to largely unaware overseas audiences as courageously as it sends up the man figure-heading the conflict. Nonetheless, there remains an interesting process of collective cultural memory in which the quality of the actual piece is considered synonymous with its historical impact or relevance, and Chaplin's wartime satire is no exception. As such, while unquestionably still a very strong film in its own right, on contemporary examination, while The Great Dictator is unquestionably one of the most important films of all time, sadly it cannot also claim the title as one of the best.",

81,7 November 2014,Chrismeister,9, One of the Finest Pieces of Cinema in the Past 70 Years,"Charlie Chaplin was an actor and director who was known for his very unique style of slapstick and comedy in general. This was his first venture into all-talking, all-sound film, thirteen years after the end on the silent era. The result was one of the finest pieces of cinema in the last 70 years. First impressions are, for any veteran Chaplin fan, simply familiar territory. We see a hapless private during the war fail at the most basic tasks and be humiliated for it. Then we see a ludicrous bomb spin around the flour in circles after our supposed protagonist. Personally this form of comedy is not to my tastes yet Chaplin is one of few comedians able to make it work for me, leading more to my great respect for this filmmaker. This really sets the tone for the film of serious situations and events portrayed in a more accessible way for the audience. Considering the 1940 release this was very important in order to raise awareness of the war in Europe. And it is clear that this was one of Chaplin's goals as the conclusion to the film shows. Chaplin gives a typically on form performance filled with great timing and physicality that he became famous for. Hilarity ensues whenever he wants it to and this fact is why he is one of the greatest comic actors of all time. In many ways this is a one man show, not suggesting the supporting cast is in any way irrelevant or underwhelming. They are just great for Chaplin to bounce off. Yet combined with him leads to some brilliantly choreographed sequences. The sets are visually impressive when coupled with this choreography and the mise-en-scene overall has to be commended. Its comedic twist on authentic, what was current eastern European lifestyles and militaristic parodies of Nazi uniform and propaganda are ingenious. All this combined makes for a fantastically memorable film that has stood the test of time, yet it is considered one of the all-time greats. This is because of, what I consider to be the most potent, relevant and emotionally impactful speech in not only cinema history but in the last one hundred years. The raw, unrelenting passion Chaplin exudes during these defining moments are is nothing short of beautiful. What makes this so expressively vivid is how, as a modern audience member of the twenty first century, I can see how the same problems remain after all these years. Chaplin glimpsed a future without division, without hatred, anger, war and intolerance, a future we could so easily attain. Yet we are all human, something The Great Dictator shows will just lead to the same problems again and again as Chaplin's character fails again and again. Yet with the courage and hope he gains at the very end, the world changes. As The Great Dictator shows, without hope all is lost.",

Having been made early in the second world war, this film is a great spectacle of wartime propaganda and satire against Hitler. Unfortunately, as Charlie Chaplin's first talkie, his well-renowned comedic timing suffers in the film. Chaplin's signature comedic walking makes one appearance, and his signature suit makes about two. All in all, visual gags are only provided every 15 minutes or so. This is understandable, as he is mocking Hitler for half the film, and he's attempting to replace visual gags with something more appropriate for a talkie. His pseudo-German is hysterical, but he relies on it too heavily. English dialog is extremely dumbed down compared to the Marx Brothers' films of the same period, leaving political jargon that, rather than having satirical merit, tends to simply slow down the film. After an hour of bearing with this shortcoming, the film does pick up slightly, especially after a turning point in the film involving new diplomacy.

His tramp remains one of the most recognizable figures in cinematic history even almost 100 years after his introduction, but Chaplin knew at the time that it would probably be fatal to the character and possibly to his career if he were to give the tramp a voice. People just wouldn't be able to accept it, or at least it would just not sound right. However, in The Great Dictator, he seems to pull off this seemingly impossible feat very successfully. ",

The man was a genius of his own craft, and besides being a film-maker/story writer and obviously very good actor/entertainer of many fields/music composer... as a mere comic, just as a mere comic he could be hilarious in many different ways: through his nervy mimics and tricks and facial/whole body gymnastics, his interaction with surrounding props, situational comedy, coming up with ridiculous visual ideas for a scene, ridiculous concepts for a character's name or attributes, with his own voice... he was the complete entertainer/performer, and this being said not nearly in the cold academic,'accomplished artist' sort of way, but truly a creator of on-screen magic, provoker of visceral and sincere laughter, and a man whose greatest quality were in fact none of these things, but the weight of his heart and the great warmth of his humanity. All of this finds truth and application in this film in particular as he's in full-blown Chaplin mode and displays his full effect here. The famous speech this film is notorious for deserves recognition as it is in essence good while of course utopic, and although it seems the film was made for that scene they did a good job really crafting a good motion picture in itself, as a whole. ",
98,21 July 2010,jboothmillard,7, The Great Dictator,"Sir Charlie Chaplin made a long career out of silent comedy films, and there was question as to whether he could go into sound pictures, and this his first proved he could. Basically it is the last days of the First World War, and military pilot Schultz (Reginald Gardiner) has his life saved by a clumsy soldier (Chaplin, also directing), who crashing the plane loses his memory, and goes back to his job as a Jewish Barber. In Tomania meanwhile, dictator Adenoid Hynkel (also Chaplin), who unintentionally looks very similar to the barber, is gripping the country. He is discriminating the Jewish people, but the barber's territory is untouched when Schultz recognises the man who saved him, and Hynkel needs someone to take the blame for when his plans go downhill. Schultz is arrested for being a friend to the Jews, where they are all placed into Concentration Camps, and Hynkel's next plan is to march his army into Osterlich to show up Napaloni - Dictator of Bacteria (Oscar nominated Jack Oakie). Schultz and the also captured barber manage to escape the camp in disguises, and when Hynkel is mixed up for the barber while fishing, the barber, posing as Hynkel, gets his once in a lifetime chance to end the tyranny with all of Osterlich and Tomania listening. Also starring Henry Daniell as Garbitsch, Billy Gilbert as Herring, Grace Hayle as Madame Napaloni and Carter DeHaven as Bacterian Ambassador. The best moments of the film for me are Hynkel's hand being raised to silence to crowd immediately, and of course the ballet like dancing with the balloon globe of the world, bouncing on his hands and bum. The critics are entitled to their opinion, but I personally don't think it's quite worthy of five stars, but from what I id laugh at, it is certainly a good first sound picture from Chaplin, and an amusing wartime satire comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Music for Meredith Willson and Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Chaplin. Sir Charlie Chaplin was number 50 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 24 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, he was number 38 on The World's Greatest Actor, and he was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 70 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 37 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs.

It's fascinating to see how in the final scene of the film, Charles Chaplin realizes that war was coming and Hitler was no joke, so he decides to write the final speech where he tries really hard to get a peace message to the world, one message that nazis and Germans could ear too, he almost begs for humanity to see the world, one world that was rotting.

104,11 February 2014,phobonnika,10, The 10th greatest film of all time.,"What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? Fictional dictator Adenoid Hynkel tries to expand his empire while a poor Jewish barber tries to avoid persecution from Hynkel's regime. We start the top 10 countdown with one of the eldest of the collection of all-time greats, a later day work of a director we all know and love more often than not for his charismatic and vaudeville performances on the screen rather than his blueprinting off it. Along with all great directors throughout history, Chaplin's greatest work is disputed to a short fallen conclusion. Notable for his consistent recurrence of the themes of strife of the downtrodden and 'good triumphs over evil' fables, The Great Dictator is, at face value, no exception. But the film's rich tapestry holds so much more to it than that, elevating it to a stance of assuming easily the role of not only Chaplin's greatest but one of history's greatest. One has to admire the bravery of Chaplin to produce such a touching, topical and quite frankly worldly historic piece of propaganda entertainment in 1940 for his loyal subjects: the distressed, the downtrodden and fed up allied population. It's piece of work that, as it rumbles into life, seems to be a misfit and muddled fledgling of a picture, soon turns into the greatest comedy ever made. Yet, astonishingly, after it assumes this role, it proves ever more versatile to the dumbfounded and subdued audience, showing a climactic bout of emotional power and vigour in the form of Chaplin's Dictator's famous dictatorial speech. The skill to represent both the weak and the powerful with his interchangeable portrayal of two characters, who take turns in being the mature and immature of the pair, ending on the prior mentioned sublime and bittersweet monologue of conflicting internal ideals of the satirised Hitler as a largely solo effort, just goes to show the untouchable echelons of what performance and direction working in harmony in the right place at the right time can be like. The Great Dictator is often said to be a weaker film amongst its competitors of the 1940s and 1930s, but cometh the hour of darkness: cometh the document of courage and faith with both humanist and more serious intent.",

I've heard the same rumors that many have noted about the supposed lukewarm attitude Chaplin had about Hitler's regime, but a simple glance at the production and release dates of this film should once and finally put an end to that disinformation. This was not only a brilliantly hilarious lampooning of a vile ideology, I consider it to be the Gold Standard of cinematic satire. I can only hope that the lucky few Jewish survivors of the Nazi's inhumanity who saw this movie found it in some small way satisfying.

126,7 October 2021,natalyasn,10, Chaplin's Dark Masterpiece,"Review for ART 1145 American Cinema - The Great Dictator
The Great Dictator is a film directed, written, produced, and starring the famous comedian, Charlie Chapman. This 1940 movie set in World War I follows a Jewish barber from the ghetto and a dictator Adenoid Hynkel who is a parody of Adolf Hitler, the fascist, anti-Semitic dictator of Nazi Germany at the time. Throughout the movie, we follow the realities of both the Jewish barber and Adenoid Hynkel, and somewhere down the line gets mixed up since they look alike (Chaplin played both parts). This leads to the Jewish barber giving one the best and emotionally driven speeches in Hollywood. Passionate words that want freedom, justice, liberty, and genuine goodwill for all. This satirical comedy-drama film, in more ways than one, is the start of many important starts in Hollywood. This film made this Chaplin's first true sound film since this was a time ""talkie"" has just begun in the film industry. This was a very big step for Chaplin, considering he was most famous for his silent films. Also, this is the first movie in history to b parody and be against everything Adolf Hitler stood for (dictatorship, fascism, antisemitism, etc.). This is quite surprising, because in 1940, America was still very isolated on the horrors Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany were doing. Chaplin was able to capture the disturbing and dangerous world of fascism while still having genuinely funny slapstick humor. This was a darkly funny and emotional, that still very socially relevant today. Hate and animosity still exists in many communities, and Chaplin's speech is something everyone should take in and listen to.",

The parody of the strong, guttural German accent, and Hitler's gestures when lecturing on hatred and repression, is very similar to reality. In fact, the scene with Adenoid Hynkel playing with a balloon that resembles the Earth, is not far from historical evidence.

His previous feature, Modern Times (1936), was his most ""political"" film to date, and in that masterpiece he demonstrated how fluidly he could merge the political and the comical, turning out a ""message movie"" that went down smoothly. The same is true for much of The Great Dictator, which is a frequently hilarious film that boldly uses caricature and satire to ridicule the leading despots of the early 20th century. Even many years later than it's first appearance on the screen this movie is more updated than ever! The totalitarianism and alienation of people are now a daily reality. Like their release of Modern Times last fall, Criterion has done fantastic work with The Great Dictator, giving us a new 2K high-definition transfer taken from a combination of a 35mm fine-grain master positive and a 35mm duplicate negative. Extensive digital restoration has removed virtually all signs of age and damage without losing the image's grain structure and film like appearance. All in all, there are no complains here, or even minor quibbles, for that matter. The image is sharp, well-detailed, and beautifully rendered in gray scale, with good black levels and excellent contrast. The monaural soundtrack, transferred at 24-bit from the sound negative and digitally restored, likewise gives the film a new lease on life. There are no cracks, pops, or ambient hiss, and the dialogue and sound effects are clear and precise.",

That it was wildly popular but drubbed his career and signalled his decline is depressingly predictable - this is the fate of anyone who not only sticks their head above the parapet but pole-vaults over it whistling. Not all of it works, but the dreamy slapstick is surprisingly effective and the dark overtones are jarringly arresting to say the least. That final vaunted speech still rings out like a loud scream in the night from the darkest period in modern history. When I first saw it over a decade ago I was stunned and inspired.

151,22 March 2022,Horst_In_Translation,6," A great dictator, but merely a good movie","""The Great Dictator"" is an American black-and-white movie from 1940, so this one is over 80 years old now and it is mostly in the English language. Two other languages are merely minor inclusions. The star of it all is of course Charles Chaplin, who was around the age of 50 when he wrote this, directed this and played the title character. As there is more seriousness to this film than there usually is to his works, nobody should be surprised that he was not credited as Charlie this time. The movie runs for slightly over two hours, so it is not a short film at all. It is maybe Chaplin's most known career effort as of now and as many still consider him the greatest character that film has ever seen, this means quite something. His (in terms of length) record-breaking standing ovation at the Oscars was as self-explanatory as the rating here on imdb (that currectly has the movie at #62 in the top250) and also the amount of people who saw and rated a film this old. I am not exactly sure why, but this film is/was shown in movie theaters again these days. I hope it does not have anything to do with the current political climate, especially the situation in Eastern Europe, but let us not get into that now. The biggest female character in this film was played by Paulette Goddard and it was not the first time she worked with Chaplin. Still, it must be said that everybody other than Chaplin was just a supporting player in here. He is so much at the center of it all that he even plays two key characters, one good guy and one bad guy. I will get to these a little later. I felt that at the very start when we see the World War I action this movie made it obvious that sound was still something relatively new to the movies and it looked a bit amateurish, but you cannot be mad at them if you see the year this was made. Actually, the sound got much better later on, so no hard feelings. From the technical perspective, it is also interesting how in the final speech there are references about radio and airplane being really new technological achievements, so this was surely interesting to watch from a contemporary perspective and I am sure people back then never would have expected the aviation industry to look the way it does now in 2022.

It is not his best work, but I would definitely recommend it to Chaplin fans. I feel that Charlie Chaplin was at his most powerful in his silent films. Here, he seems a little unsure of himself, in terms of balancing acts that he could pantomime with verbal jokes. Don't get me wrong, there is some hilarious dialog in this movie. It is not short on laughs by any means, but Chaplin's best films had a brilliant sense of balance to them, a balance between drama and comedy that few have ever been able to match. It is a very good movie, but, unfortunately I don't feel it matches up against Chaplin's best, although, I can't think of many films that do! What this film does have going for it, and it has quite a bit going for it, is another brilliant performance from Charles Chaplin. Only this time, aside from his spectacular physical comedy, Chaplin proves he also knows how to deliver his lines with a comedic timing that is every-bit as precise as his pantomime. The highlights are the brilliant dance with the globe and the powerful, moving speech that Chaplin gives at the end of the film. His performance as Adenoid Hynkel, a biting satire of Adolf Hitler, is so off-the-wall, so silly that it accomplishes exactly what Chaplin sought out to do - to make the world laugh at Hitler, to rob him of his power. Mel Brooks would do a fine job of defaming Hitler twenty-eight years later in his hilarious debut film, The Producers. If there is one lesson to be learned from this movie (that isn't expressed in the speech at the end), it's that laughter can sometimes be the best medicine. While no one can ever undo the atrocities that Hitler exposed the world to, we can survive, as long as we have our ideals and our sense of humor.",

This makes the story feels too much overstretched. The slapstick and silly comedic moments aimed to defame the then common enemy of the Allies, Adolf Hitler, feels too long and too much hyperbolic. I must say though that the comedies are being done nicely. They are funny and enjoyable. The parody covers all aspects that are important about the war.

166,9 May 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,9," A courageous, smart and resonant satire that's just as important today as it was when it was first released.","'The Great Dictator (1940)' is a smart, pointed and subversive satire that's all the more impressive when you take into account the fact it was made during a time when most people weren't keyed into the true nature of the Nazis, nor was the full extent of either the war or Hitler's atrocities underway. I'd consider this Chaplin's finest film precisely because it is so brave, boldly taking a stance against a very real threat and using its comedy to send a message of love for all humanity at a time when the world needed it the most, and would soon need it even more. Its satire is used in a number of ways: to lampoon dictatorships, as well as a certain someone in particular; to heighten the ultimately ridiculous and power-hungry motives of its targeted regimes; and to create sympathy for those being unjustly persecuted. It is comedy that works on many levels and the balance between the usual slapstick 'Chaplin' style with the more pointed satirical stuff is a usually deft one. The flick brings everyone down to the same level and never seems mean-spirited. It makes sure to include some darker elements, though, so as not to make light of the situation entirely. Indeed, its slapstick asides do ever-so-often seem slightly too immature compared to its real darkness and on-point political themes. This is never a true problem, however, and the sequences in question don't last for too long, while also serving a purpose. There are some jokes that cut too close to the bone, though - since they sometimes have a startling and sobering accuracy, unseen when they were first made. These are impossible to laugh at nowadays, unlike the more general jokes which can be taken for what they are despite the gravity generally associated with them. The piece also takes somewhat of a slow detour towards its final movement, during which time the heart of the story is sort of lost. However, this flick still resonates strongly today. Its timeless message is told with an endearing execution, whether that be through its direct final speech or through its layered satire. The film has a point and makes tells it well, actually feeling incredibly important. It's just as impactful 78 years after its release, perhaps more so. It is also an interesting historical study about using your medium to take a stand, even if everyone else tells you not to. 9/10",

194,3 March 2023,sumathyramesh-92949,10, How do we get The Great Dictator into the kindergarten curriculum globally?,"I have never been much of a Charlie Chaplin fan; born and bred in the cinema era where audio had been well integrated into the artform, the visuals, the dialogues and the music augmenting and enhancing each other to established heights in mass communication of the producer's intent, tI didn't have the maturity to seek out silent movies. I also didn't know Charlie Chaplin made non-silent movies- until yesterday when I chanced on it in the oscars-category of one of our free-to-air on-demand-channels choosing to exercises my every nerve fibre while my husband was engaged in a, let us say, limited form of exercise, choosing to sweat out to the instructions of an online yoga teacher. My nerve are still quivering from the impact of the opening scene where a humble barber-turned a overnight front-liner on the theatre of war leans on his humour to plough through the moment, as his line of command hands down one weapon/control of a war-equipment that he barely understood, let alone had the mastery to deploy.",
195,8 October 2022,SPZMaxinema,8," A powerful movie for the time, and funny!","The movie was mostly saved by the last third, when the other dictator played by Jack Oakie went on screen (with the humor that accompanied his role) and when the movie made the genius decision to switch the dictator and the Jewish barber and have him give that historic (unfortunately just for film) speech at the end. Charlie Chaplin acted, wrote, and directed the movie very well as he does with all of his productions, and while it was kind of slow and wasted time in a few parts, I'm glad that I chose to sit through it. Plus, who can't get enough of Charlie Chaplin's style of slapstick comedy??",
196,14 March 2003,counterrevolutionary,7, Screwed up in the end (possible spoilers),"Most of this film is an alternately hilarious and brutal satire on Nazism and Fascism, made at the height of those movements' success.",
197,12 February 2019,podunko,10, Hynckel = Trump,"I must say that I was never into silent films for the most part,and for that reason Charlie Chaplin was never much on my radar. Well after screening this amazing film which he wrote, directed, and starred (twice), what can you say. CC was an amazing individual and I am planning to catch up on his life and works. And yes, during some of Hynkel's speeches, it appears our current fear mongering leader took some of them verbatim. 79 years ago, shall we ever learn...",
198,24 December 2020,alirezazamani-73059,3, Boring and expired movie!,I can understand why this movie is exciting in 1940 but now this movie is really boring and definitely this is an expired movie!! but only the imitation of movements of Hitler(Hinkle)sometimes is really funny!,
199,27 October 1998,Dej,10, An inspired crossover from silent to talkies.,"The master of cinema made this noble gesture at a time when others chose to be silent about the horror shaping in Europe. Innovative in combining sound and Chaplin's traditional silent, visual artistry, this film is an important milestone for the medium as well as the director.",
