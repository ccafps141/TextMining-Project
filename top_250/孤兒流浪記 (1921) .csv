2,29 August 2005,Cineanalyst,9, Smiling and Tearing,"""The Kid"" is a powerfully emotional and wonderfully hilarious motion picture and was a tremendous breakthrough in Charlie Chaplin's oeuvre. He hadn't filled a film so fully with pathos since ""The Vagabond"" (1916), and then it was in a very limited way--subject to the confines of two reels. And, ""Sunnyside"" (1919) was a failure. The feature length of ""The Kid"" also allows Chaplin to elaborate and refine the gags, pranks and set pieces, and with the support of Jackie Coogan, it's one of his funniest comedies.",e

Aside from Chaplin cast opposite Marie Dressler in TILLIE'S PUNCTURED ROMANCE (1914), a Mack Sennett production hailed as the first feature length comedy, THE KID starts Chaplin with a whole new cycle of feature comedies, but releases coming once every two to three years. A comic genius who got his start in comedy shorts starting in 1914, eventually under the supervision and direction of himself, Chaplin's methods in movie making improved with each passing film. Like himself, Jackie Coogan, Chaplin's littlest co-star and title character, made such an impression with his initial performance, nearly upstaging his impresario, that he immediately found himself starring in movies on his own, becoming Hollywood's first important child star.",v

5,21 August 2008,Quinoa1984,10, rarely has there ever been such a deft mix of wonderful absurdity and (dark) sentiment as here,"It's easy to call Charlie Chaplin a genius, but I'll say it once again: the man was a genius, if only at doing a certain particular kind of film. You wouldn't ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film, or at least one like out of Germany, or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths. His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the 20s and 30s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion. Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental, but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and (the usual kicked-around word) manipulated amid the comedic set-ups. Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer, and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the Kid.",e

It is a silent movie but so rich, winning and beautiful that you don´t nead words. Chaplin and 6-year old Coogan are possibly the most charming pair I have ever seen in my life. The film succees to be nicely light and full of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental. I always get my eyes full with tears of saddness and happiness. And I really never cry in movies. And the music...its simply Oscar-level! The movie is sympathetic, full of feeling, touchingly funny moments.

It begins with a woman who's ""sin was motherhood,"" who gives birth to a baby she can't support at a Charity Hospital which is kept pad-locked from the inside. She is forced to abandon it in an alley, and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film, as he is casually strolling by and then, through a series of odd but entirely believable situations, he is unable to get rid of it.

13,9 May 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, Chaplin's most emotionally resonant silent film.,"There's some genuine slapstick brilliance in 'The Kid (1921)', with Chaplin bumbling about in his typical clumsy style. The comedy is marked by an innocence, not often seen anymore, that just makes you smile. The physical comedy is to an incredibly high standard and there are some some genuinely dangerous stunts, too, seen during an exciting chase sequence. There are some heart-string tugging moments as well, because this picture as a real heart to it. It's probably the most emotionally resonant of Chaplin's silent films, with a real emotional payoff. Of course the feature is dated, it is nearly a hundred years old, and there's a bizarre fantasy sequence towards the end that stands out as an odd and unnecessary aside. The piece's silent styling and heightened reality setting allows it to more-or-less totally stand the test of time and provide some honest enjoyment, though. It's an endearing and entertaining ride that definitely fulfils its opening promise of a 'smile and, perhaps, a tear.' 7/10",2

Child becomes an apple of his eyes in a few years but the mother comes back to claim her son. I had heard that this was the best movie Charlie Chaplin made but I disagree with that statement completely. No doubt it's a fantastic movie with a very strong story and message but it's definitely not his best. I found the last scene of the movie a little contrite and compromising. The story has been adapted and tried in very many forms. Extremely sensitive and though provoking cinema. A must see for all.,_

For me, the problem with the film is that it doesn't even come close to the polish and quality of films made just a few years later. THE GOLD RUSH (1925) and THE CIRCUS (1928) are masterpieces, as were his next few films. They managed to combine pathos, excellent story telling and comedy. THE KID, instead, was mostly a very superficial attempt to elicit tears and pathos--while having very little comedy and a paper-thin plot.",=

26,19 July 2013,ironhorse_iv,9," Indeed Six Reels of Joy! A picture with a smile-and perhaps, a tear.","This was Chaplin's and one of the first full-length movie for Hollywood. Before then, most silent films were still short and quickly put out. It took nearly a year for Chaplin to finish this movie. Although this film started out as another short film, by the time it was done, Charles taken more shots and retakes than any film before as done. By completion, it had grown into a six reel feature film. The Kid is thought to be influenced by Chaplin's own childhood and what was happening at the time in his life. At the time his wife Mildred Harris was pregnant. On 1919, she gave birth to a malformed boy that die 3 days later. The event took its ton on Chaplin's personal life. It seems to have influenced Chaplin's work, as he planned a film that turned the Tramp character into the father figure of a young boy. You can see that he transmute his personal pain into something that stir people hearts. His relationship with Mildred Harris have become soured to the point, that Charlie Chaplin became afraid of her trying to steal the film from him during the divorce hearings. The film opens up with an unwed poor mother (Edna Purviance) coming out of a hospital with a baby. You can tell it's illegitimate, as in Chaplin's life, who was himself illegitimate, edits the image of the father an artist burning the photo of the woman. The woman hold the baby and walks as if Jesus holding a cross which is shot fading out. It's hard to tell what Chaplin meant with this explicit Christian symbolism, but the symbolisms returns throughout the film confusing more people. I can only sense that Chaplin was going for fragility, and transience of true moments of human love, over the sacrifice of pain. By having a halo seem to appear the mother head for a few moments, it might represent Virgin Mary. Anyways, she comes across on her self-journey seeing a bride who just got marry. The bride drops a withered flower, symbolizing her loss of virginity. By doing this, I believe it represent her sacrifice her life by marrying an old man that she does not love for money. Within a few seconds, Chaplin takes pose symbolism that commit on hypocritical American piety, puritanism, and organized religion. It's hard to make a saint out of this movie character when she gives up the kid in hope of a better life by leaving the child in a rich person's car. Instead of an rich person finding the baby, two thefts stole the car, and tossed the baby out near some trash cans. It is there, that the Tramp (Chaplin) find the baby and does everything at first to dispatch of the baby, even contemplating throwing the infant into a street grating. While it might be a bit funny, its dark humor isn't what I thought of this family movie coming in. It was a bit disturbing for the Tramp to even think that way. Anyways, the Tramp accepts fatherhood, and adopts the kid. 5 years pass, and the baby grew up as John (Jackie Coogan). John help the Tramp get work by breaking windows for him to fix. Meanwhile, the grief-stricken Edna has seen the error of her ways and leaded a life of charity. Edna and John meets when John started a fight with the local bully. It is here, that Edna believes that John is her long lost child. Soon the Tramp get into trouble too, as agents of the law figure out that the kid isn't his own and try to send the boy to an orphanage. That scene alone will get you emotional. The Tramp now has to try to find a way to keep his only love from being taken away, not only by the law, but the mother wanting to see him. The movie goes pretty good until ""Dreamland,"" sequence with angels in residence and devilish interlopers with temptation arrives in the form of 12-year old Lita Grey, whom Chaplin would marry and bitterly divorce in real life (Grey was the source of inspiration for Vladimir Nabakov's ""Lolita""). That is where it lost focus a bit. I didn't like the ending as well. In no way, should John ever be reunion with the mother who abandon him. Jackie Coogan does a great job. It's weird in a way that the actor would end up playing Uncle Fester years later on 1964's Addams Family. There are several version of this. In 1971, Chaplin, who was eager to share his work with a new generation, that he re-cut the picture, resulting in a version that was shorter. I thought the scenes he cut were very good and added a little more depth to the characters. There is a crucial 80-second scene which is missing in that version. The mother goes to a bridge and encounters something which makes her decide that she wants the child after all. Since films and soundtracks are often copyrighted separately at the time, it was hard to find the right song for the film. Chaplin wrote all of the music for his pictures and few survive over the years. The film is still riddled with age related artifacts that, even with this skillful transfer, are still present. Film grain is moderate. Black levels are sometimes weak. The gray scale is adequately balanced. Aliasing, edge enhancement and shimmering of fine details are all present and sometimes distract. The audio is 5.1 and nicely balanced. I couldn't see the lettering in my version. Overall: If you are a Chaplin fan, this movie is a must have. If you are not a fan, but are curious what all the fuss is about, this movie will let you know. Without a doubt, one of the most beautiful, moving, and tearful both in sadness and in joy, movies ever made.",_

Though his parents, both music hall entertainers, separated before his third birthday, they also raised him into the entertainment business. His first appearance on film was in 'Making a Living (1914),' a one-reel comedy released on February 2, 1914. It didn't take long for Chaplin to find his niche in the film-making industry, and his character of the Tramp  who first appeared in 'Kid Auto Races at Venice (1914)'  guaranteed his popularity and longevity in the industry. After a string of successful short films, among the most accomplished of which are 'Shoulder Arms (1918)' and 'A Dog's Life (1918),' Chaplin commenced production on his first feature-length outing with the Tramp. 'The Kid (1921)' proved an instant success, becoming the second highest-grossing film of 1921 {behind Rex Ingram's 'The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921)'} and ensuring another fifteen years of comedies featuring Chaplin's most enduring character.",v
30,27 July 2016,Otoboke,7," Fun, amusing and humble","When it comes to classic cinema and especially those often bunched into the ""masterpiece"" corner, you must prepare yourself when reading reviews for strong gusts of superlatives and overblown gushing over minute details. Your shining suit of scepticism should be worn at all times, weary traveller. Although a fun and enjoyable film, The Kid which has been met with steady and sustained acclaim since its debut in 1921, you could argue is a good example of such criticism gone awry. It's a sometimes-amusing and often-heart-warming feature, sure, but a masterpiece? Not so much. At least not for me. The comedy's plot which revolves around the Tramp adopting an abandoned orphan from infancy before fast-forwarding five years where they run a bit of a racket together, is light and fluffy and has a distinct charm permeating the interactions between the two actors.

Jackie Coogan plays the kid but the title may suggest Chaplin himself in his ability to prevail within the realms of responsibility. Plot regards a young kid who is made suddenly available to his care and a series of slapstick adventures follow as authority attempt to claim the kid. Chaplin branches out as his trademark Tramp raises this kid and together they team up to make cash. Coogan breaks windows and Chaplin repairs them for cash. Coogan is credited as the first screen child actor and his ability to mimic Chaplin's actions are flawless. When he is finally taken away it provides the emotional core. Edna Purviance appears a Coogan's mother whom gave up the kid in hopes that someone caring would raise him. She eventually turns up again but the return is not as cliché as expected. Carl Miller appears as the man who stares at her photographic image before accidentally losing it to fire. Tom Wilson plays a police officer who pursues Chaplin to obvious comic effect. The visual elements were top notch for its time particularly a Heavenly dream sequence but this film will mainly be enjoyed and remembered as Chaplin's first successful feature film. Score: 9 / 10",

34,17 June 2010,jboothmillard,9, The Kid,"I had seen one Buster Keaton silent comedy film, and enjoyed it immensely, so it was obvious I wanted to see the most famous British silent star working in America in a film. Basically The Woman, or Edna (Edna Purviance) comes out of the charity hospital, carrying her new born baby, which she places in a limousine with a pleading note, and she runs away to commit suicide, which she does not go through with. The limousine is stolen by two crooks who find the baby, and dump it in a garbage can, where he is found by passing Tramp, or Charlie (Sir Charlie Chaplin). The Tramp cares for the Kid, or John (Jackie Coogan, who grew up to be Uncle Fester in The Addams Family, 1960's TV show) for five years, and in that time Edna has become an opera star doing charity work for poor children, hoping to find her son. The Kid is The Tramp's partner in crime, breaking people's windows so that Charlie can put a new piece of glass in and get money from it. A doctor comes round to see the Kid when he is sick, and he is shocked to see the note left when he was a baby, he says he will get the Orphan Asylum men to come and get him. This note is passed to Edna, who realises they have found her little boy, and the Tramp manages to save the Kid before he gets to the Asylum. The Kid is taken away again, and after a quick dream involving angels and stuff, The Tramp wakes to be taken to Edna and the Kid where they all unite at her mansion. This is notable for being the first feature length comedy to combine comedy and drama, and only a fine director and star like Chaplin could do it. It is a film that makes you laugh at the moments of slapstick, and with the help of the music and the touching abandoned child story and some great music by Eric Rogers, it has emotion too, a great classic. Sir Charlie Chaplin was number 50 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 24 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, he was number 38 on The World's Greatest Actor, and he was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, The Tramp was number 38 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and the film was number 99 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for when The Kid is taken away and then found again.

The young star proved to be no less adept and resourceful at evading cops and whipping bullies, and while only half the size of his mentor was at least equally as funny.

Of course, the big star here is Charles Chaplin. He was around the age of 30, slightly over probably when he wrote, directed and starred in this film. It is still a contender for his most known work. It has a number of six-digit ratings here on imdb, which is really a lot for a film from the black-and-white silent film days. Of course it helps how easily accesible it is nowadays. But other factors are helping as well, for example that this one is in the top100 highest rated films here on imdb. And the name Chaplin is always a crowd magnet. I had the chance to watch this film today at a theater for the very first time and I was baffled how the room (and it was a really big room) was basically packed.

However, having spent nearly two years on a production which resulted in a completed film of six reels, it must have appeared inevitable that the comedian had made himself worthy of another evaluation. Chaplin's first feature film as a director is presented as ""A film with a laugh – and perhaps a tear"" in an opening title, and this promise is being kept throughout; quite definitely so. The film has the Tramp finding an abandoned baby, whom he eventually adopts. As a few years go by, the two of them struggle to make both ends meet, and they are forced to use some quite imaginative methods in order to survive: a brilliant sequence has the Kid breaking windows while the Tramp casually walks by as a glazier Obviously, they are frequently in trouble with the law, and the Tramp might not come across as an overwhelmingly ideal parent; at least not at first sight. However, eventually a visit from a representative of a children's home put to question who is really capable of giving the Kid love and affection when he needs it the most",

The characters of The Tramp and The Child form an inseparable team after the 'adoption', and one would be hard pressed to hold back a tear or two when the Social Service Agency of the era comes calling to remove the youngster from Chaplin's care. With Chaplin's agonizing attention to detail, the story goes from slapstick to pathos and back with such fluid movement that one is taken from joyous laughter to tearful sorrow virtually within the same scene.

72,8 July 2014,ofpsmith,9, The most heartfelt Charlie Chaplin film.,"This is the most heartfelt Charlie Chaplin film I've seen so far. As the opening title sequence says ""A story with a laugh and perhaps a tear."" Or something like that. Anyway it's about The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) who finds a child (Jackie Coogan) from a mother unable to take care of him. At first Chaplin is unwilling to take on the responsibilities of a father but eventually adapts to Jackie Coogan and becomes a good father. Coogan even takes after Chaplin and does all the things that he does. We cut to 5 years later when everything seems to be going fine until a doctor (Henry Bergman) finds out about it and comes to take Coogan to a orphanage. But Chaplin fights back and he and Coogan are united. I have to say for a filmmaker who has mostly made a career of of slapstick this actually is a very mature film from Chaplin. It's the first time that he's taken a very grown up topic like parental responsibilities into one of his films. But it's not all completely serious, it's still pretty funny, and the trademark Chaplin slapstick is there. So basically this combines two things that Chaplin was obviously really good at. I say absolutely check this one out.",

Another has Coogan getting into a fight with another boy, leading to Chaplin getting into a fight with his (very large, seemingly padded) older brother. Things get sad and pull the heartstrings when the city comes to take Coogan away to an orphan asylum, and it's interesting that the film touches on the rights of an adoptive parent (""are you his father?"").",

I think the opening intertitle said it best ""a picture with a smile and perhaps, a tear."" It was much like many of his other films in that it blends slapstick comedy with an incredible amount of heart. I watch hundreds of films every year, and the number one thing that bothers me is when a film tries to be something it's not. Whether that means it focuses too much on one genre or tries to do way too much with its script, I can assure you that The Kid does not have these issues. I think this is most prevalent when the Tramp, played by Chaplin, is running across rooftops trying to catch up to his adopted son being taken away by the authorities. I laughed multiple times as Chaplin pulls the clumsy Tramp gags he does so well but it was hard to hold back tears a few seconds later as he reunites for a few moments with his son.",

90,23 September 2017,sol-,8, Heartbreak Kid,"Taking care of an abandoned baby changes the life of a tramp in this iconic silent comedy. The film has a place in cinema history as Charles Chaplin's first feature length film, but it is even more noteworthy as a rare comedy in which Chaplin does not dominate every scene with Jackie Coogan turning in a fine performance as the boy at age five. In addition to having great chemistry with Chaplin, Coogan has several authentic emotional moments that ring true as he cries and wails when well-meaning authorities try to separate him from his adoptive father. The film has quite a solid dramatic backbone too with Chaplin's tramp gradually coming to truly love the baby who he initially tried to pass on to someone else. That said, 'The Kid' is also an inventive and funny film with some great routines in which the two protagonists scurry about and confuse those chasing after them. In fact, were it not for a rushed, unrealistic ending and an overlong, out-of-place dream sequence, a good case could be made for this being Chaplin's finest film. Flawed as it may be though, it is easy to see why the film has won the hearts of many over the years and has become a sentimental favourite for lots of viewers.",
91,25 September 2020,calderonp8,7, Chaplin's Personal Film,"""The Kid"" was the first Charlie Chaplin film that I watched, and I must say I'm impressed with its great acting, its story and the deeper themes with which it deals. While the film is around 100 years old, I believe it's still very watchable. The production is amazing for a film that old, while of course it was limited by the technology of the time I think the subjects with which it deals are still very relevant today. Probably the most important thing shown in the film is how women who have children at a young age or simply don't have the resources to provide for them, are not supported. In the movie this makes ""the Woman"", see getting rid of her child as her only option, because she won't be able to give him everything he will need. To a certain degree that still happens today, as even though there are planned parenthood centres and some support for single mothers, a lot of times they aren't ready, and are shunned by their family for something that isn't necessarily their fault. The film is probably also based on Chaplin's experience as child who had to basically grow up without parents. The character of ""the Man"" could also be based on Chaplin's own father, who was an alcoholic who was never there for his family. In the film. the Man seems like he isn't doing too bad for himself, but still decides not to provide for a child he brought into the world. The acting in the film is surprisingly good, Jackie Coogan (""the Kid"") does an unbelievable job at his role, and in my opinion he is the star of the film, since it all revolves around him. While in the film ""the Tramp"" (Chaplin) may not be the most successful, he cares for the Kid as if he was his own, which ultimately he is. A father is someone who will always give his son unconditional love and try to give his child the best he can, not necessarily the biological father. Chaplin fulfils this role in the film, and I can say he is the face of kindness of the movie. His acting is also excellent, and his slapstick humour doesn't take anything from the film, instead it helps be a sort of comic relief and help the film maintain a more or less playful tone. A scene which I'm not quite sure why it was included or how it adds to the story is the one where the Tramp is dreaming and he sees a world of angels who are sort of corrupted by demons. My best guess is that he is trying to show how even the best people will sometimes make bad decisions or can be influenced to do things they will later regret. Another thing the scene could signify are Chaplin's own demons from his personal life, and how even when he is a good person he makes mistakes too. Overall this is a good film, as it deals with real life problems that are even still relevant today. Yes, the story is simple and its characters may not be super developed, it's still a grand accomplishment for its time and a movie that I would still say is very worth watching.",

Chaplin's comic persona in his movies was just pure genius (of which makes me think of Clint Eastwood's persona in his movies, but more of the comedic type.) The casting for this movie has one thing in common with Cuaron's Gravity (2013) and that is that both movies have 2 actors in them.

Chaplin and Coogan are a great, unforgettable pair. In Coogan you can see little Charlie Chaplin. Little kid plays his role better than well... he's great and so is ""the big"" Chaplin as well! There's so much beauty in the story. The movie tells in a simple way a story about a little boy, a tramp and a desperate woman. In a cute Chaplin way everything has a happy end but before the happy end there's a lot of sadness... and of course also many funny scenes. I think it's amazing how Chaplin can make little things so funny. Charlie Chaplin's mimic is amazingly good, best in the world. His face can show all the feelings incredibly well and little Coogan has learned that from Chaplin. This film must be the most beautiful story about vagabond's life. Maybe Chaplin's best film! All Chaplin's films are worth of watching and especially this one! This movie shows that words are not needed in the movies... words are just disturbing the great mimic. One picture tells more than thousand words, Chaplin really shows that that's true!",

Though, not everything is good alike: this is not because of Edna Purviance's acting, but the woman's story is much less interesting, and somewhat badly developed. The end is also poor: I am sure that Chaplin was able to create hundreds of more original, entertaining, and touching ways of showing the same than the abrupt last scene he shot. To resume, ""The kid"" is a quite good movie, there is no doubt about that. If this review may seem to be exaggerate in criticism, that is because we always expect a masterpiece from Charlie Chaplin.

Circumstance has put the two together, though, and after using his brain to get through the child's early years, the Tramp's put him to work as part of a slightly-shady window replacement scheme.

106,17 May 2019,dfranzen70,9, Duck and cover,"This movie is considered one of the very finest ever made, and with good reason. Chaplin, in his Tramp character, does a masterful job of telling the story of a baby, left in a limousine by his destitute mother so that he may have a better life, who is then discovered by The Tramp and raised as his own. This is much to the chagrin of local bad boys, the cops, and what passed for Child Services in 1921. Jackie Coogan is the Kid (he'd go on to greater fame in the 1960s as Uncle Fester in The Addams Family), and man can he act. He's an adorable little waif as it is, but his expressions and motions belie his age. Plus, his interactions with Chaplin are genuine and incomparable. And then there's the choreography! In particular, there's an extended fight scene involving Coogan and an older boy, followed quickly by one with Chaplin and a top-heavy bully (the other boy's brother). Chaplin's physical prowess is amazing - think Jackie Chan today - but it's the work of all of the actors, in perfect sync, that really makes the scene click. This is a classic.",

109,12 October 2021,springfieldrental,9, Chaplin's First Feature Film,"Charlie Chaplin knew the direction of cinema was leaning towards longer feature films, something he had avoided throughout his movie career. He embarked on an ambitious undertaking where he looked to transform comedic pictures with a blend of farce and pathos. Maybe it was the recent dissolution of his short-lived marriage, or the loss of his three-day old infant, or a nostalgia attack of his own parentless childhood. Whatever the reason, his written and directed January 1921's ""The Kid"" established a new category in cinema: a comedy with a twist of poignancy. Chaplin prefaces his first feature with the title card 'A picture with a smile--and perhaps, a tear' to prepare his viewers this was not going to be a normal knockabout comedy.",

All is going well until five year later when the kid falls ill. A ""country doctor"" (in reference to a 1909 movie) is called, and decides that the sick kid need proper attention and care. Subsequently, a rigid and horrendous orphanage director comes with an officer to take on the child. Which, of course, Chaplin tries successfully to avoid, and ends up in a workhouse. Unfortunately, the formerly desperate mother, now become a star, posted an ad to reward who would bring the kid back, and while Charlie is asleep, the workhouse manager brings the kid to the police station. All ends well as the mother is not a heartless b***ch and welcome Chaplin to her place to see the kid. End. OK, this was factual. Now for the emotional part, Chaplin fulfill this masterpiece with laughters & tears, as we are foretold from the very beginning.

112,5 June 2004,Zoopansick,3, Chaplin sucking it hardcore again,"This was yet another dull and pointless Charlie Chaplin movie.  His antics as usual consist of getting hit in the head, doing exaggerated pantomime (sp?), and running around and into various objects.  The plot is pretty non-existent but it consists of Chaplin (playing a yet another bum) adopting this orphan kid and the antics that follow.  This movie, like pretty much all of Chaplin's work comes off as dated and drags on due to inconsistent plotting.  I don't think there is anything that funny about Chaplin's schtick.  It might be funny for kids because it plays like a cartoon, but Buster Keaton is vastly superior.  Keaton doesn't come off nearly as dated and his movies actually have more of a plot then some poor guy just bumming around.  Also his slapstick is more elaborate, creative, and in my opinion memorable.  Chaplin benefited heavily at the time because he represented a move away from the rigid Victorian standards of the previous decades, and was a character that a large working class country could identify with. However today he doesn't hold up too well especially when compared with Keaton.  Nevertheless if you like this guy then you will probably dismiss what I'm saying and rent or buy (if you're so enclined) this movie. Hopefully though you won't see it, because it sucks.  Rent something by Keaton or even the Marx Brothers (if you don't mind talkies) if you are in the mood for a really old comedy, you'll be glad you did.",

This silent film is now over 90 years old. It is one of Chaplin's greatest, and showcases his incomparable talents. You cannot help to be touched emotionally watching it. In addition to acting and directing, it is also likely that he wrote the musical score (as he did for many of his films). Jackie Coogan's performance is also remarkable. Chaplin really did have a great amount of affection for Coogan, and remembered him for the rest of his life. Edna Purviance was not able to make a success of her career after Chaplin, but he kept her on his payroll for the remainder of her life. Lita Grey, Chaplin's second wife and the mother of his two oldest sons Charles Jr. and Sydney, has a very brief appearance in the ""dream sequence"".

120,25 April 2022,garethcrook,9, Not a bad debut.,"I've never watched a Charlie Chaplin film all the way through before. Sure I've seen the clips, but watching in entirety is another thing. The Kid, not only written, directed and produced by Chaplin, was scored too. This is no minor thing, score is always important but more so when the film is otherwise silent. A young woman, left alone with an unwanted child. Does what she thinks is best, leaving him in a fancy car in an affluent area, only for the car to be pinched by two robbers, who then leave him out on the street. It's dramatic stuff. Thank god for Charlie who instantly lightens the mood as The Tramp. There's little need to describe him of course, he's iconic. The look, the walk. Watching him for a full feature though, you see just how well rounded a character he is, right from the get go. He finds himself at first comically landed with the kid, until he discovers he's orphaned when he melts and becomes possibly the worlds least prepared father. The storytelling is light, but full of heart and really zips along at quite a lick. Everything's very economical, there's not a wasted shot. The Tramp is an inventive sort, raising the boy to not only help make ends meet, but also be great on screen. Child actor Jackie Coogan really is a delight, but doesn't steal Chaplin's thunder. It's hysterical fun as the pair get into scraps in the slums, but when the boy gets sick the pesky authorities try to intervene to take him to the 'orphanage asylum', now that doesn't sound good does it. Chaplin is of course fantastic, but really the whole case are excellent. Portraying real joy and despair with the actions. There's some wonderful sequences too, even a rooftop chase, a brawl in a moving car and a trippy dream sequence. It's blockbuster stuff. When the mother returns to the picture, well let's just say the simple, dramatic, action filled comedy, also ticks the satisfactory box in a touching finale that had me smiling from ear to ear. Not bad for a debut feature.",

The only difference is the color of the movie, the duration, 95 years and the switch C. Chaplin/W. Smith. A miserable life for Chaplin here until he finds the baby - his new life. Happiness, in most of the cases, arrives easier to poor people because they know how to enjoy life with less. The trouble is that there are lots of mothers who still abandon their vulnerable children nowadays. And this movie is from 1921! It looks like plenty of parents did not watch this movie so that it could arrive to their hearts or feelings, and think twice the option of abandoning a child. But what kind of life does Chaplin has in the movie? Some dreadful clothes, a miserable room and a few pennies to eat some soup or cupcakes during the day? However, a child could always bring prosperity as it happens in The Kid. They seek for each other constantly and that is true love. It is understandable that a young mother could reach to the point to abandon a child, but what it is valuable in the movie is that after realising what she has committed, she gives charities to the penniless society. Since the encounter with the kid, Chaplin makes it easier to nourish, because we all know that life is better when you are positive, and moreover when you take it as a joke.",

137,13 April 2020,zeekwunlau,8, Little people look at the big world,"After watching this movie, my biggest feeling is that time passes quickly. Although it is a silent movie, the storyline and character expression in it, I think that it is not lost to the current sound movie, which is more abundant than the sound movie. Fuller, this is the so-called classic.
The film probably tells about a poor London woman who abandoned illegitimate children in a car in front of a rich man 's house, but the car was stolen, and the thief threw the child beside the trash can. The child picked it up to raise him and named him Jony. This decision revealed the chance of coincidence in the raising process, which made people laugh. I think this may be the relationship between Charlotte and the child.
When the child grew up to four or five years old, Charlotte took him out to work. The child first threw a stone through the window of the family, Charlotte stepped forward to change the glass, was caught by the police, and was visually left. Locke tried to kick him away when Jony wanted to go with him. This paragraph impressed me a lot, and now I feel quite like it.
Later, the charity of the country wanted to send the child to the kindergarten. Charlotte fought with the people who came, wanted to take the child back, and even over the roof, catching up with the flying truck, this section made me deeply Resonating, not all the parents in the world, in order to protect their children, they tried their best to make people cry, and finally Charlotte again embraced Jony in his arms.
Charlotte could not return to the top floor where he lived, so he took the children to the nightclub. He had no money and had to go first, and then opened the window to let Jony climb in. The film revealed Charlotte's constraints everywhere, but he still Adopted Jony, which shows Charlotte's inner beauty.
At the end of the movie, there was a picture of an angel. I did n't understand it too much at first. Then I found out the name of the movie, ""The Story of Searching for a Fairy"", and then suddenly realized that when the police finally led Charlotte to the end Going to Jony's biological mother's house, he and Jony hugged tightly, making the movie finally complete.
When watching this movie, we can easily find that although this movie is silent, it accompanies this music from beginning to end. With the slow, brisk, and exciting music, the development of the plot also fluctuates. When Charlotte found it in the hotel When the child is lost, the music is suddenly heated up, and we deeply understand Charlotte's anxiety through the music. I think the role of music in this silent film is very important. It makes up for the monotony of silent films, allowing people to deeply appreciate the ups and downs of the plot and add to the atmosphere.
When the actor cannot communicate the language in the silent film, I think, this will inevitably require the actor to have a strong performance, so that the audience can understand the character's feelings and inner activities. What impressed me was the brother of a kid who was fighting with Jony. He showed his strong feeling everywhere, but later when he was fighting with Charlotte, we looked at his movements and found that his limbs might be Flexible but his head doesn't seem to have much aura, he just fully shows what he is like with his body movements.

I have watched several of Charlie's movies like the 1931 masterpiece 'City Lights' and the wonderful world of 'Modern Times'. You are hugely mistaken if you think movies of the past are superannuated. In fact, I used to think like that too until I watched City Lights. On the other hand, The Kid was released years before City Lights. It is not an overstatement to call Charlie a genius. The Kid, even being such an old movie, has a rich plot. One of the main characteristics of Charlie's films are the details. If we watch his movies carefully each and every scene have a grandeur of details. One example of a clever yet a powerful detail from the movie, for a 1921 movie, as I remember, was a scene when Charlie showed ""the kid"" to the women outside his house. The women asked Charlie the name of the kid. Charlie didn't knew the name. He would have told any random name but he didn't as he didn't knew if the kid was a boy or a girl. So, he goes into the house; checks; comes out and instantly tells the ladies ""John"". It takes some time to get all the jokes as we the people of 21st century are not used to silent comedy.",

Simple, subtle and straightforward, Chaplin succeeds both as an actor and a director. As an actor, he plays his usual role of Charlot, a goofy flat-feet-ed short man with a hat and a mustache, who, in this case, finds a baby on the street and decides to raise him. As a director, Chaplin manages to employ a quite ""cinematic"" style, quite contrary to many of his former movies. Because cinematic art, generally speaking, is composed of two major elements: the narrator's ability to choose his focus and the film's reliance on visual rather than verbal information. This film excels in both. Not only is it purely visual, but the manner in which Chaplin places his camera highlights the characters and helps narrate this unornamented tale of parental love. It is highly emotional yet it never crosses the line to melodramatic. It is capable of producing a great deal of through to the viewer yet its subdued themes and messages are never overstated, they never become clear and evident, they sort of come out through the laughter and the tears.

Chaplin's genius lays in the perfect ability to keep the tragedy away from the banality of melodrama, to keep his comedy subtle and not banal, and of course staging the scene perfectly. Only very few after Chaplin has reached to such cleverness with setting up the joke that the joke itself is surprising (and sometimes even a plot twist). Chaplin and Jackie Coogan form one of the most enjoyable dynamic duos (on- and off-screen) in the history of the cinema. The story is sad, and the way Chaplin has directed it puts all those neo-realists into shame. The sad bits highlight the gags and vice versa. This movie oozes with warmth. It's only bitty that this sort of humane touch has gone lost in the art of filmmaking.",

Its a milestone in film history as the first example of a silent comedy feature integrating drama and pathos into the comedy. Jackie Coogan gives a great performance in the title role almost as a miniature Tramp which is probably what Charlie meant all along. The Kid and the tramp are two of a kind, just as Charlie was a child performer too, a clog dancer with the Eight Lancashire Lads. In many ways this is Chaplin's most personal work almost re-enacting episodes of his own poverty stricken childhood of the 1890s. The only disappointing sequence is the Tramp's dream of heaven which seems a bit irrelevant but does look pretty. ",

Very good movie, funny, dramatic, and the soundtrack is perfectly fit with every scene of this silent film. The story kind of reminds me of Charles Dickens' novels.

That film would be ""The Kid."" The Kid is a 1921 film made by Charlie Chaplin. Do I really need to explain who Chaplin is? No, okay good. Chaplin directed and starred in this film about his famous ""tramp"" character taking care of a young child abandoned by his mother. And thus Chaplin's typical slapstick humor ensues. I know some people could argue that this film isn't edgy enough because it's just Chaplin running around being Charlie Chaplin. And although that's true I do sense a lot more heart in this film, especially during the opening scene, where I legitimately felt bad for the mother getting rid of her child. Life can be cruel sometimes. That being said because this is a Charlie Chaplin film, and to me the comedy and drama didn't blend that well. And keep in mind this is the only problem I have with the film. Because it's a Chaplin film and because it's about his tramp character, you sometimes can't tell the difference between comedy and drama. Like seriously your son being taken away now is not the time for comedy! Other than that I absolutely adored this film. And it looks like audience members did to. The acting was great, the score was beautiful, and the story is filled with plenty of heart. The Kid deserves the rating of a 9/10.",

Even though I found it long at times, it seems to have held up well and managed to be a vintage piece of film while still being significant to society. Especially now, there's a huge stigma towards police and Chaplin's film portrayed them with that same stigma.

176,26 May 2005,sweetkness,6, First Chaplin film I viewed,"I found this film touching in a way, the main reasons for this may have been that it was the first Charlie Chaplin film that I had viewed, and I saw it in a film class, which might have made me pay extra attention to the film. However, I am writing this comment quite a while after seeing the film, and since then I have seen a few other Chaplin films, and in my opinion, if you've seen one Chaplin film, you've seen them all. True, this film has a bit more touching feeling to it do to the ""adult/child, father/son"" relationship, but the overall reaction I had at the end of the film was the same as any other Chaplin film. Now maybe this is just do to the limitations of the silent film era, but I tend to group all Chaplin films into the same mold.

Of course, the amazing slapstick humour does feel dated, but I still found my self enjoying almost all of the film. I believe Charlie Chaplin's acting in this movie is quite phenomenal, as this was his first film that had a story and emotion behind a character. You could really feel the relationship building with him and this orphaned child, as he really didn't know what to do with this random baby at the start. However, the actor I believe steals the movie, is the child. Since it's a silent film, I would have thought that a child would have a tough time expressing and showing emotion, but he did everything flawlessly, especially when he's getting taken away on the back of the truck. Towards the end though, in the ""dream"" sequence, I believe that scene to bring the emotion and suspense down. I was so confused, thinking he died, and I think it was just plain unneccessary. This movie is so great since it was one of the pinnacle starters for stories in movies. Overall though, this movie was hilarious and I highly recommend it, as it's a must watch",

I didn't really know how I'd feel about it, but after watching it I am very glad I did. This movie is a timeless piece of art. I absolutely loved watching this film as it felt like I was seeing the 1920's for myself. As the movie isn't fully realistic as Chaplin walks around in his slapstick style, it is very cool to me that I can see something filmed so long ago, in a normal realistic setting. This movie is completely watchable, even 100 years later. The star of this film ""The Kid"", played by Jackie Coogan made me want this movie to be longer. Coogan did a wonderful job as playing this mischievous, loving and goofy kid. I have a hard time wrapping my head around that a six year old can act this well. Chaplin also does a great job playing his iconic role ""The Tramp."" I saw a side of his character that I didn't expect to see, a soft and caring side while taking care of The Kid. This softer more caring side of The Tramp, plus his slapstick acting create this unique character that I really enjoyed. The only thing I felt lost on was the devils and angels scene. It may have made sense at the time (1920's), but in 2020, It left me feeling quite lost, although it was a fun scene to watch. Overall, everyone needs to watch this classic.",

It's fading into each other rather than just cutting into the new scene.Also, the score for this movie already has me hooked on the movie itself even before the five minute mark. The music is very good at representing the emotions you're supposed to be feeling during the movie without being able to hear what is actually going on. I love how reluctant Chaplin is to take in the baby, but when he decides to take it home you can see his facial expressions become slightly softer, as if he's starting to like the child. The ways he attempts to care for the child are very unique and pleasant to watch. By the time it gets to 5 years later, the expressions by both actors let you know that they have gotten in sync with each other and have created a routine around each other. The scene where the child is making pancakes to me, proves how good he was raised and how responsible the kid is. Next, the entire time when the child was being taken away was very emotional, both the facial expressions and the score really add to the sadness of the scene. Jumping ahead to the end, I like ho wit was not given away that the policeman was taking Chaplin to see the kid, this sort of surprise at the end made me enjoy the movie more. I typically enjoy happy endings, so I was very glad that this movie had one. Overall, I really liked this movie.

I found the movie entertaining to watch and can just imagine all the hype and excitement it received from when it was in it's prime. The storyline doesn't seem to different compared to some movies today, the only difference being how we make them. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and the actors did a great job presenting the emotion of the characters. With the movie having no sound, it's just straight up impressive. Expression in emotion and movement were a key factor in order to the audience to get engaged with what's happening.
Chaplin himself is an excellent actor! His slapsticks are funny and few made me chuckle. He was careful to put in the right amount of comedy into this story, that it isn't completely serious until later in the movie. It tells the audience that he doesn't film JUST comedic films, but also stories. Like today's movies, I like a sprinkle of comedy in them.",

192,15 October 2020,winstonc-86282,8, It's Good.,"When talking about the cinematography, I personally don't think films in general should be thought of in terms of ""relevance"" to today's standards - it's more of personal opinion, and if you enjoyed it, or not particularly so. The aspects that could be compared to today's expectations could be the acting, the topic of the plot, the actors' mannerisms, language, and so on.
I liked this film because it was obviously different than other films I've seen in the past. Not the black and white, I've seen plenty of those, but the silent aspect. It almost forced me to pay attention to what was going on or I wouldn't quite understand the next coming segments. The general plot, which was Chaplin's experience ""adopting"" an abandoned child, can still be seen as relevant to issues today since yes there are millions of children in the world who have been abandoned/adopted due to all sorts of circumstances, and I believe the film could bring awareness to that. Chaplin's humorous bits were good too, and of course by today's standards most films have humor sprinkled in.
Thus for these reasons, it may be an 100 year old vintage film compared to today's standards, but I thought it was cool, and the plot it carried.",

195,1 October 2020,Max-Bouskill,10, Very nice :),"The kid is a film starring Charlie Chaplin as the tramp raising an orphan boy. Now before watching I highly recommend thinking how film back then was still incredibly primitive and films didn't even focus on story. some would say this doesn't fit with todays standards which I don't really agree with. A tale of raising a child and the thought of losing them is still very much relevant today however technology the used to do so is definitely outdated. So I can only half agree on this film not fitting in. Another example is how society is portrayed, still being accurate to this day, only things that I find being different is how everything is the same but evolved if that makes sense. For example the tramp and the kid stay at a sleeping place. I don't know how to word it but the place they stayed in really makes me think of a hotel. Now Charlie's acting. I firmly believe that this film needs slapstick to ease tension in between moments, causing a nice balance of drama and comedy. If the film was just a comedy the story wouldn't work, and if the film was a drama it wouldn't feel like a Chaplin film. The film addresses many morals like raising an orphan, finding out your orphaned son is being cared of by a lower class man, what it means to be a father, and the efforts someone would go to just to see their kid again. The only thing that I can't find a clear connection to the film is the dream sequence with the angels and the devils. From the research I've done it seems Chaplin held a long-standing fascination with dream sequences. Robinson suggests that this arose from appearing in a Fred Karno sketch called, ""Jimmy the Fearless, or the Boy 'Ero"", in which Chaplin played a ragamuffin who embarks on a series of misadventures before waking up and realizing his exploits were all just a dream. One actor named Stanley Jefferson, who played Jimmy for a single performance-Chaplin gave Stanley the boot once he realized the role's promise-suggested the same thing:
""Charlie loved to play Jimmy, and the memory of that role and of the production stayed with him all his life, I think. You can see Jimmy the Fearless all over some of his pictures - dream sequences, for instance. He was fond of them, especially in his early pictures. And when it comes down to it, I've always thought that poor, brave, dreamy Jimmy one day grew up to be Charlie the Tramp."" Now, another question that could be arisen is who the star of the show is. One would say it's Chaplin because the tramp is the main character. The thing is I feel like Chaplin steals the show for more reasons than that. I strongly feel as if Chaplin truly poured his heart and soul into this film as a director and actor. The raw emotion and enthusiasm is so contagious with the way he acts and directs. I would go as far as to say that this film is a masterpiece for all I know. That's all I can really think of. Seeya.",

Be warned that some scenes may be rather upsetting, such as the scene in which the child is removed from the tramps care and taken to an institution due to being an orphan. Other than that the movie is appropriate for young children and will likely be found humorous by them. The directing is very good, the acting has a bit of exaggerated expressions due to film quality back then, but is still pretty good and the screenplay is entertaining other than the in my opinion unnecessary dream sequence. Due to these reasons i would give this movie an 8/10 and encourage people to watch it, as they may just enjoy it.",
202,12 February 2018,samuelhfrans,8, The Kid,"I will begin this review by giving a brief plot summary so you, the reader, have an impression of the goings on in the film if you haven't yet seen it. The film begins with a mother and her infant child. Very early on in the film the mother decides that she simply cannot care for the child, so she abandons it in the rear seat of an unoccupied car. The unoccupied car then because the partially unoccupied car and is subsequently stolen by car thieves. The thieves eventually take notice of the small child in the back seat and, in turn, they abandon it themselves in an alleyway. In this alley is where the iconic figure of Charlie Chaplin's Tramp character is presented and he eventually finds that he will have to be the one to care for the infant. 
Time lapses five years into the future and we find Chaplin and the child, which can now more accurately be referred to as a ""kid"", living together in a raggedy one bedroomed apartment. Chaplin's tramp is clearly presented as a surrogate father figure for the kid, and the two of them appear to coexist in a relationship that is both playful and loving. The rest of the movie unfolds after the stage is set as I just did for you. It is mostly instances of how the two paupers have to swindle there way into sources of income, and the misadventures that come along with it.
The film was released in the year 1921. Releasing a film in this time period could be considered overly restricting by some individuals, considering that ""talkies"" had yet to be a staple of the medium. However, Chaplin absolutely encapsulates the melodrama of the story and expertly enables the story to be told through movement and design, rather than through dialogue. 
Chaplin's tramp character is the iconic image of Charlie Chaplin that everybody knows even if they have never seen one of his movies. Every aspect of the character from his attire (bowler hat, cane, small waist coat, large trousers and shoes) to his over exaggerated gestures make for an expressive performance that is both memorable and inevitably iconic. It is worth noting the charismatic performance of the kid as well. He is an excited young man that is clearly enjoying himself in the filmmaking process, and his relationship with Chaplin is quite endearing. 
 The Kid is an exciting display of creativity that translates into iconic film. A scene that stands out is one in which Chaplin's tramp character is being chased along rooftops by a police officer, and another would be a dream sequence where characters throughout the streets have angel wings that can be purchased at a corner store. It is worth noting the impression that this film must have made upon audiences when it was first released. Even in modern times it comes across and a piece of utterly unique cinema, which is a testament to the acting and filmmaking genius that Charlie Chaplin had. I cannot recommend this movie enough to anyone that is interested in the history and progression of filmmaking as an art, or anyone that wants to lose themselves in a charming story about a man and his kid.",
203,1 February 2022,aniketroyanik,8, The kid by Charlie Chaplin is an abnormal masterpiece.,"The Kid (1921) : The kid is a film based on a abandon kid by his own mother. The film was written, directed & produced by Charlie Chaplin. He also appear on screen as A Tramp & acts very well both in every comic relief scenes & dramatic scenes. The character of the child was played by Jackie Coogan was the main attraction of the film. As a child artist this was one of the very first few films of jack's career. He did a wonderful job on the screen. Specially his dramatic expression was so accurate on the screen. Though this was silent film, the storytelling & narrativity of the film was well execute with the never ending orchestra used as background music. Through the film Chaplin want to give a great message with the part of ""Dreamland"". How jealousy can affect our human relations was metaphorically shown in these particular scene. The film shows us how a mother cannot take his own sons responsibilities when she is not establish in society. At a moment no one want the kid A Tramp man takes the kid to his home & take all responsibilities. Later on as the story developed the mother somehow became a star & found his son ill during his charity. She couldn't recognize the child firstly but doctor told her the truth & she realizes her fault. The film ends with a happy ending with a frame of three main characters of the film. Mother role was played by Edna Puriance. Her acting also good through the film. The whole film had a great response throughout the audiences & film critics all over the world. It was a nice combination of comedy & drama with a good storyline.",
204,21 August 2020,e-62759,9, Great Movie,This movie is great from start to finish. It has some happy moments and so sad moments. I haven't seen a silent film and The Kid was my first one. It is a great introduction into the silent films.,
205,23 August 2020,l-12454,4, It's a boring movie in my opinion,"It was kind of boring because nobody really talked during the movie. I also didn't like the clothes they were kind of really baggy and old school a lot, the mustache if Charlie Chaplin, was pretty weird because who would cut their mustache like that in 2020. I don't know by but part of the whole movie was the little kid running away and fighting little kids. Most of the building were almost really half worn out and broken.",
206,21 August 2020,w-43636,7, my rating,This movie was really good and funny there was dramma some comedy and it was really just a good movie i would watch it again,

208,21 August 2020,i-20418,6, Review,I think the movie is exceptional for its time but being born in this age of technology the film is somewhat primitive. I dislike that it is silent and has that the movie moves slow(frame by frame),
209,21 August 2020,o-54068,7, OK movie,The story that takes place is kind of interesting for a film that was made in 1921.everything else was black and white and frame to frame but it was still enjoyable,
210,21 August 2020,u-54682,6, The Kid,I think that this film is a really good film and I enjoyed watching it. It was really funny. I think the best part was when the 2 kids started fighting because the kid took Charlie's adopted kid's toy.,
211,21 August 2020,t-53643,7, The Kid,Personally I thought this was a good movie. Considering the time it was made in with the limitive technology it managed to tell a story that was interesting while being entertaining and comedic.,
212,21 August 2020,i-74564,7, Good movie,"The film was very pleasant, shorter than a modern day film. But with the technology at the time, I was surprised at how far they got with it. Although not doing very well at the box office, 'The Kid' was a good film.",
213,21 August 2020,z-19611,6, Its an ok movie,I would say this is a great movie that was made during the 1921 but i prefer to watch longer movies because i honestly don't care andi rarely watch movies.,
214,24 August 2020,l-35284,8, little review :)),"I enjoyed the two iconic main characters in the story; a father and a son. The plot was quite simple and heartwarming. For a movie without any audio from the actors talking, the music picked was well thought out.Something I really loved about the movie was when the father kept on waddling while running away from trouble while the son always caused trouble like throwing a rock at a window. However, I found a lot of scenes to be on the street around the same place so at a certain point, I felt like it was becoming a little repetitive.Overall, great movie especially for it's time launched",

218,2 August 2015,yadeehoo,10, Now I hate every other movies,"I found it quite hard watching dated movies, I've never watched any Chaplin movie before. ",
219,15 October 2017,sweetchic2332,9, Overall Good,"""The Kid"" released in 1921 is the story of a tramp (played by Charlie Chaplin) that comes into caring for an orphaned child. The movie made me feel so many things! I felt happy for both the kid and the tramp in that they found each other and were able to formulate a life together. I enjoyed seeing their relationship progress and develop. I couldn't help but think about the kid's mother and feel sad for her, though I enjoyed seeing the tramp come into his own through taking care of the kid. The film was written by Charlie Chaplin, and I enjoyed seeing how Charlie as a writer developed the relationship and love and care between the kid and the tramp. I thought he did a great job in that regard, however, for me it bothers me when there are loose ends in stories and the mother's role and absence in the story really bothered me.",
