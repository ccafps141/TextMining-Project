0,6 February 2016,blanche-2,10, fantastic film that takes place in postwar Vienna,"Even today in Vienna, one can take the ""Third Man Tour"" (Der Dritte Man) except, of course, that Orson Welles wouldn't go into the Viennese sewers and those scenes were done in England. There were actual sewer scenes with a double. Never mind, it is still a magnificent black and white film 99% filmed in Vienna. Directed by Carol Reed, it stars Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, and Alida Valli.",/
1,11 December 2015,gogoschka-1,10, Simply Beautiful,"I don't know why this movie always hooks me the way it does; it's obviously a masterpiece and a revered piece of British/American cinema - but that alone is not the reason (there are other such masterpieces which fail to have that effect on me). Maybe it's the setting: the beautiful city of Vienna right after World War II, the scars of the most devastating conflict in human history still visible at every corner. Or it's the contrast between the eerily happy music tune - which plays throughout the entire film - and the dark, tragic story of murder and betrayal which I find so strangely captivating. Whatever it is, I just love this movie.",r

This film, directed brilliantly by Carol Reed (""Odd Man Out"", ""The Fallen Idol"") and written by Graham Greene, who created a long list of memorable cinematic scripts, ingeniously captures the prevailing atmosphere of disruption and chaos that Vienna, a once highly civilized city, experienced during the years that followed World War II. The upheaval is physical, social, economic, political, moral, spiritual. You name it. Vanquished Vienna, conquered by the Allies, was crippled by turmoil in every imaginable way, and we viewers are given the opportunity to experience it up close, right here.",e

17,27 September 2003,MovieAddict2016,10, Haunting and Poetic; A True Masterpiece...,"Carol Reed's ""The Third Man"" strikes all the right cords, establishing  itself on so many different levels that it almost becomes untouchable.  It has an underlying tone of darkness that not only thrills but chills.  It grabs the viewer from the start and never lets go.  It opens with Anton Karas' startling zither music and quickly propels  the viewer into a world of evil and lies. The tale is familiar to any  film lovers: A pulp Western writer named Holly Martin (Joseph Cotten)  is invited to post-war Vienna by an old friend of his, Harry Lime  (Orson Welles). The city has been divided into American, British,  French and Russian zones. The city exists as a shattered remnant of the  past - haunting and horrifying, dark and mysterious.   Upon his arrival, Holly discovers to his horror that his old college  pal is dead - hit by a car in the middle of a street. But for Holly,  the circumstances don't add up - everyone involved in the accident was  related in some way or another to Harry. So Holly searches for clues,  much to the chagrin of the British officer Calloway (Trevor Howard),  whose name is misused as Callohan by Holly many times throughout the  film. (""It's 'Calloway,' Mr. Martin, I'm not Irish."")  Holly Martin does begin to stumble upon some vital clues as to the real  story behind Lime's death - and finds out more than he bargained for.  Lime's old girlfriend is a stage actress. (""Always comedy."") She  accompanies Holly throughout the film, and we expect an underlying  romance to blossom, but yet in the end it does not - one of the many  surprises of the film.  I suppose it would be a sin for me to give away how Harry Lime  reappears, or even give away the fact that he does, for that matter  (though by now I am sure you realize Orson Welles is in this movie and  therefore turns out to be alive). But for those who have seen the film,  we all remember that terrific scene where the cat meows, and suddenly  he appears, an evil smirk on his face like a child who has gotten away  with the cookie from the jar. And then the ferris wheel scene, and the  chase through the sewers that no doubt helped win the film an Oscar for  cinematography. These are all some of the most memorable of film  scenes.  The director of ""The Third Man,"" Carol Reed, stumbled upon the film's  musician, Anton Karas, one night in a trashy bar in Vienna. It is no  wonder that out of all his candidates he chose Karas - the film's tune  is literally the most perfect example of matching harmony between a  film and its music I have ever seen (although ""JAWS"" is up there with  it). To go into the music is pointless - it must simply be heard in  synchronism with the film for you to understand where I am coming from.  When I think of film noir, ""D.O.A."" (1949) and ""The Third Man"" (1949)  are the first two films that come to mind. Both accomplish what they  set out to do, but ""The Third Man"" exceeds even farther than the former  - it is haunting and almost poetically vibrant in the way it displays  its story and the outcome of its characters. It is a film that will be  around for years and years. ""Citizen Kane"" is often thought of as the  greatest American motion picture of all time. But if I had to choose  between the two, I would most likely choose ""The Third Man."" It's just  my opinion, of course, and many may not agree, but as far as I see,  ""The Third Man"" beats ""Citizen Kane"" - for me - on more levels than  one.   Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) was an artistic film that rarely used  close-ups. It would almost stand back from the scenes and let the  viewer focus on what he or she wanted to focus on. ""The Third Man"" has  many close-ups. I do not take this as a director trying to give the  audience what he wants them to see, but rather a director in touch with  his feelings and ideas. Director Carol Reed knows just how to evoke  characters' feelings from scenes and close-up shots. The camera tilts  at awkward angles more often than not. The more and more paranoid and  afraid our hero becomes the more and more intense the close-ups and  angles. There is some haunting material in ""The Third Man,"" some  material the most novice of filmgoers might not expect. And the music  and direction only makes it all the more terrifying and haunting. This  is a film that you must witness to believe.  5/5.",/

20,27 September 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10, Brilliant,"The Third Man is really quite a brilliant film, and one of the best British films ever made in my opinion. There are several reasons why I think this. The cinematography is just outstanding, and helps fashion a city full of menace and the score is jaunty and flawlessly echoes the film's wit and drama. Then there is a dark yet playful script(two other words to describe the film itself too), impeccable direction from master of place, angle and shade Carol Reed and a gem of a story that grips you right up till the ending. The Third Man is also blessed with performances more perfect than you can ask for from Joseph Cotten and especially Orson Welles.

It's both gripping AND original. Each image on the screen is indelible. I'll give one example. Joseph Cotton waiting for Orson Welles at the gigantic ferris wheel, his coat flapping in the wintry breeze. The scene that follows references all the themes we have been introduced to previously -- crime, friendship, love, betrayal -- and it's very funny too.

25,21 May 2002,peanutthegreat,10, Joseph Cotten is Excellent in Revolutionary Film Noir,"""I never knew the Old Vienna, before the war, with its Strauss Music,"" opens Carol Reed's The Third Man, and we catch a glimpse of the New Vienna, with its Black Market and its Shady Deals. Joseph Cotten plays cheap novelette author Holly Martins, just arrived in Vienna to meet with long-time friend Harry Lime, who offered him a job. He instead meets with the mysterious facts surrounding the death of Lime, learned bit-by-bit from Lime's friends, a woman named Anna Schmidt, who has problems of her own (played excellently by Valli), and two British officers, Calloway and Paine. Learning, that there is more to death of Lime than there seems to be, Martins begins his investigation for the truth. This film was shot with some of the greatest, most ahead-of-its-time cinematography ever, and it creates mystery and deceit. It is complimented by the excellent use of shadows. The soundtrack is essentially one long song, which plays throughout the film, changing and stopping as the emotion calls for. It is a zither composition by Anton Karas made for the film. This is all topped off by an engrossing storyline, and a great performance by Joseph Cotten, as the ordinary man mixed up in this web of mystery.",t

Photographed under an opening window in a deserted Vienna street, Lime comes into focus as a fleeting face with a smug expression and suddenly we remember Orson Welles was included in the credits. It's a very powerful moment -- one which has us, the viewer, shift our consciousness into wanting to see more of him, wanting to get to know him even if he is a shady, corrupted character.

31,27 September 2005,Theo Robertson,8, The Technical Points Make It A Classic,I can't help believing THE THIRD MAN is a film highly regarded because of its technical achievements rather than by its story . The plot itself is rather simplistic : American writer Holly Martins gets a message from his friend Harry Lime offering him a job in Vienna and when he arrives in the city he discovers Harry is dead . There's a mystery involved in how Harry died but because everyone is so familiar with the plot twists ( This film was made nearly 20 years before I was born ) there's no real surprises as to the story ,

34,7 June 2021,nickenchuggets,10, Possibly the best British movie ever,"Widely considered one of the best movies ever made, The Third Man is a prime example of how great storytelling combined with the sad setting of postwar Vienna can produce a cinematic masterpiece. The movie is about Holly Martins, someone from the US, going to Vienna in Austria shortly after the second world war is over. The war has had a noticeable effect on the city's architecture, and many of the buildings are gutted and in ruins. Amid this depressing location (which has been divided into four occupation zones by the victorious allies), Martins tries to seek out one of his childhood friends, Harry Lime. Later on, Martins is told that he should give up his search because his friend is dead, hit by a car when he was crossing a street. Even after attending his so called funeral, Martins is not so sure that his friend is dead, and along the way of his search, he meets Major Calloway and Lime's girlfriend, Anna. She, like Martins, starts to become convinced that Limes ""death"" was faked on purpose, and they both come to the conclusion that you don't create fake evidence unless you're trying to hide something. Later on, Martins goes to see Lime's doctor, who says he only arrived at the scene of the accident once Lime was dead. Shortly afterwards, someone willing to give Martins information dies suddenly, which only adds to the suspicion. Major Calloway tells Martins to leave Austria, but he doesn't want to until he can determine once and for all if his friend is dead. Calloway tells Martins that Lime had been stealing penicilin from the army and then selling it after it was downgraded, which is very dangerous. Now aware that his friend is a criminal, Martins notices someone outside his apartment one day watching his house. It turns out to be Lime. Martins tries to chase him, but Lime loses him in seconds. Towards the end of the movie, Martins finally comes face to face with Lime on a ferris wheel, where Lime threatens him. After Lime flees to the sewer tunnels, the cops are already there in large numbers. After killing one of the officers, Lime's luck finally runs out, and he is fatally shot. We now know that Harry Lime is dead for good. This movie is awesome. It makes use of a lot of strange camera angles that I have hardly seen in movies until now, such as putting the camera between the bars on a railing. The protagonist of the movie may be Martins, but Lime is the real main character of this film, since the whole narrative revolves around finding him, and Orson Welles does a great job. What makes this movie special in another way is the ending, where Martins waits on a long street to talk to Anna, but she walks right by him without saying anything. Most people would have expected her to stop, but the movie wasn't afraid of having a cruel ending. One of the best British movies ever made, no question about it.",

36,9 January 2006,evanston_dad,10, Heaven for Graham Greene Fans,"Is there any greater entrance in cinema history than Orson Welles's in this movie? His character, Harry Lyme, supposedly dead, is hiding in a dark doorway. His American friend, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), who came to Vienna to see Lyme and instead has gotten wrapped up in trying to solve the mystery of his death, is looking toward the doorway at the figure in shadow. Suddenly, someone in an upstairs apartment across the way turns their light on, which shines directly on Harry's face, revealing him to his friend. The look Welles gives at that moment was singlehandedly deserving of an Academy Award. With just a faint smirk on his lips, a twinkle in his eye, and not one single word of dialogue, he manages to say ""hello"" to his friend, apologize for lying to him, and invite Holly in on what Harry seems to think is a great big joke.

37,31 August 2009,Hitchcoc,10, Perfection in Black and White,"I haven't watched this for 30 years. It is the consummate example of using light and darkness to produce effect. It involves the death of one Harry Live (Orson Welles) and the attempt by a friend to juggle his loyalties with his moral duty to try to fathom the circumstances. This is a film about mood and face. It's a bit expressionistic and off kilter. The one most important thing is that it fires on all cylinders. Joseph Cotten is magnificent as the man who steps into more than he knows. He meets a woman who despite LIme's evildoing can't stop loving him. As soon as we expect something to happen, there is a twist. When we expect characters to change they don't. There is a whole series of vignettes that are priceless. One of my favorites is when Cotten, a hack writer of Westerns, is forced to lecture on his literary techniques to a crowd of intellectuals who are asking him questions about James Joyce and others. He is in fear for his life at the time and the whole thing becomes a surreal event. Post war Vienna, Austria, is also a character in this film because it is actually four cities, divided, each with its own idiosyncrasies. This is one of the best films in history and does not disappoint.",

The great British director Carol Reed made three of these, although none are actually set in mainland Britain. ""The Third Man"" is set in Vienna, ""The Man Between"" in Berlin and ""Odd Man Out"" in Northern Ireland. Of the four main characters in ""The Third Man"" only one, Major Calloway, is actually British.

I love classic films, but much about this one doesn't appeal to my personal tastes. For example, I have a hard time warming up to Joseph Cotten as a leading man. For me, he spoils Hitchcock's brilliant ""Shadow of a Doubt"" and I could do without him in ""Citizen Kane."" Alida Valli is a fine actress, but her close resemblance to Karen Black prevents me from finding her attractive. The incessant zither music quickly wears out its welcome, as do the overused tilted camera angles of people running through empty streets and sewers. With that said, I was finally able to focus and understand what was going on. The mystery, for all its sound and fury, signifies not much. Even Orson Welles's fifteen minutes of screen time is redundant. I do admire the craftsmanship of this film and can see why some people love it, but I feel the whole experience is rather dissatisfying.

47,9 December 2009,Boba_Fett1138,9, Still one of the biggest mystery movies ever made.,"It's hard to compare an '40's thriller to the modern movies of the same  genre of this present day. The movies are very different in style and  todays audience demands more action, pace and sex. Yet ""The Third Man""  seems like one of those movies that are timeless, due to its well  written mystery story, a good cast and a nice overall visual style.  The movie has most often been praised for its visual style. A true  accomplishment from director Carol Reed, who has never really broken  through though. He directed many more great- but lesser known movies  throughout his career, that do deserve some more recognition. Perhaps  it's due to the fact that he mostly stayed in England and didn't  decided on going for a big Hollywood career, like many great British  directors from the same era did, that he isn't that well known and his  movies didn't received the appreciation they deserved.   But to me the foremost reason this movie being timeless is its great  story. It's a real typical mystery/thriller story, that has a couple of  twists and turns to it. It's unlike for instance the film-noir movies  from the same era, that were somewhat more or less being the 'normal'  mystery/thriller movies of those days. You could perhaps say that ""The  Third Man"" is in that regard already being a more modern movie.   The movie often puts its emphasis on its style and then mostly its  cinematography. I don't think I have ever seen so many Dutch tilts in  one movie but it really works out well for the movie its atmosphere,  that tries to be a bit of an uneasy one, for its main character to feel  himself alienated in the for him unknown big town, filled with many  different nationalities and languages that he doesn't speak or  understand at all.  The Vienna after the second world war serves as a great backdrop for  this movie its story. After WW II the town got divided into different  sectors, all ruled by different nations. It was before the cold war, so  here we have British, Americans, Russians and French authorities all  cooperating in the international zone to solve the movie its mystery.  It at times has a surreal and odd feeling to it but even at the time of  the production of this movie was still being a fact.  The movie also really has some great acting in it. The movie does at  times seems a bit dodgy with its accents, I mean it's obvious that some  of the cast members weren't some native German speakers. Joseph Cotten  plays a good main character but to me it was really Orson Welles who  played the greatest role. He was such a fine actor, in basically every  movie he ever appeared in. His acting-style in a way seemed to be  decades ahead of its time. Perhaps a bit too much for its town, or  otherwise he would had most likely been nominated more often for any  awards for it.  A great mystery movie, with an early thriller atmosphere.  9/10",
48,11 December 2005,krorie,10, I never knew the old Vienna,"This film would be on my top ten list of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It established British director Carol Reed as a director of international repute. He already had a long string of excellent movies to his credit. ""Stars Look Down,"" ""Odd Man Out,"" and ""Fallen Idol"" are among the best British films of the 1940's. Unfortunately, though he made other good films after ""The Third Man,"" none matched the skill and daring innovations of his masterpiece. Based on a story by Graham Greene, Alexander Korda, Welles, and Reed with the screenplay by Greene, ""The Third Man"" gets its energy and style mainly from two sources, Carol Reed's masterful direction and Orson Welles' stunning portrayal of the central character Harry Lime. Unfortunately, the gifted actor Joseph Cotten must play second fiddle to Welles and is not allowed to shine the way he was in Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt."" Actually the second best performance in the film is by Alida Valli who plays the vivacious Anna who continues to love Lime even after discovering that he is a despicable character responsible for hundreds of deaths and abnormalities. She never sees beyond the good times she had with him. The cat is used not only to identify Lime but also to point out that the animal loved him and he loved the animal, whereas Holly Martins (Cotten) almost kicks a dog and is bitten by a parrot, indicating that Holly is not all good and Lime is not all bad. Also, note what Holly does to his erstwhile friend Lime at the end of the movie. Maybe Lime was good earlier but the war turned him into a murderous cynic. The famous meeting between Holly and Lime at the amusement park shows Lime to be a sociopath who loves no one but himself. He uses false analogies and fallacious reasoning to justify his nefarious activities. With the use of his eyes and facial expressions, Welles makes Lime into an incarnation of the devil himself. Yet during the chase in the sewer Welles facial expressions show a kinder, gentler side to the alleged monster. Many times international criminals such as drug dealers close their eyes to the end results of their heinous trade just as Lime does in an attempt to justify their vicious crimes. Sometimes the media makes heroes out of the likes of Harry Lime. When Harry Lime is trapped he tries to escape through a gutter. His fingers are shown feeling the freedom above that is not to be his, another indication that perhaps Lime was once a different person in character and morals but now he belongs to the sewers that flow into the blue Danube.",
49,12 February 2010,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, This liberation isn't what I had expected it to be,"This is the only Carol Reed film I've watched so far, and I most definitely do not intend it to be the last. The story is immediately engaging, and the setting, post-WWII Vienna, where crime is an all too common thing, is stunning and draws you in. This also has amazing cinematography and editing, with some camera angles that I have not seen in anything from the late 40's, or many other places, for that matter. The lighting is also gorgeous. I understand that this is British Noir, a sub-genre I don't believe I've been exposed to before. The script is marvelous. Every character is great, well-developed and credible, and the dialog is all sharp and delivered with perfect timing. The plot is brilliant, compelling and intriguing, and not so convoluted that you can't follow it, or even require a second viewing to piece it all together, and the mystery and its conclusion are satisfying. Every acting performance is spot-on, and there is a lot of charm and chemistry to it. Heck, *the kid*, whose age I cannot possibly imagine had hit double digits at the time, is quite good, and certainly convincing. This actually uses other languages than English when it makes sense, German and Russian, often broken. Tension and suspense is built up well in this. The only negative I can really say about this is that the score, whenever it appears in the last half of the picture, is disruptive and draws attention to itself in how little it fits in tone with what's going on. I have experienced that in other older movies. There is a bit of disturbing content and brief mild to moderate violence in this. I recommend this to any fan of those who made it, and this type of fiction. 10/10",

53,5 September 2002,DennisLittrell,10, An atmospheric study in black and white,"I'm not one to rave about ""glorious black and white"" cinematography. Generally speaking, if it was good in black and white, it would be even better in color (but NOT colorized). However, there are exceptions. Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove would not be improved in color, and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane would not even work as well in color, partially because of the ""Movietone"" and front page photography feel that Welles wanted, but also because color would add nothing to the sharp focus on an ultimately empty icon of an entirely black and white medium. And Sir Carol Reed's The Third Man is a strongly atmospheric film that clearly is better in black and white. It might be said that if there isn't enough light, it is false to pretend to color. Flowers that bloom at night are usually white.",
54,16 June 2008,robert-temple-1,10, The Classic Postwar Atmosphere Film,"I have just seen this again for perhaps the fifth time. Over the years, one's perceptions of the film alter, one seems to grow with it, or it grows with you. This time I realized more forcibly than I had done before just how much Robert Krasker's spectacularly inspired and atmospheric cinematography made this film what it is. Krasker appropriately got an Oscar for it. He had previously done 'Brief Encounter' (1945), and later did 'Billy Budd' (1962) with Peter Ustinov directing, both highlights of his career also. Of course, this film was ultimately a triumph because of Carol Reed's superb direction. No matter that Joseph Cotten, Valli, and Orson Welles gave unforgettable performances which rank in the annals, those performances could easily have been swallowed up and lost in a bad film. To Reed goes the credit of this masterpiece. This time I noticed that he overdid the angular shots: there were just too many of them (unlike the sparing and more effective use of them by Stanley Kramer in 'On the Beach' for instance). I knew Carol well towards the end of his life. He lived at 123 Kings Road in Chelsea, where he had taken the ceiling out of his drawing room so that it was two stories high with a balcony. How well I remember the little loo at the back, with all the walls covered in framed cartoons, caricatures, and newspaper clippings about 'The Third Man'! One used his loo a lot, because of the great quantities of gin and tonic which were always on offer, and hence one was constantly re-entering the world of this film as one answered various calls of nature inspired by the gin. Carol was a very tall and imposing man, of infinitely gentle, kindly and generous nature, but in old age was greatly afflicted by a terrible deafness. I used to get so exhausted shouting at him at the top of my voice. It really does put a damper on conversational ease. He liked to reminisce about 'The Third Man'. He enjoyed a good triumph, and that was probably his greatest. What a sweet fellow, so deeply missed by all his friends, of whom I must have been the youngest. It is not so often realised how sentimental Carol was about children, especially little boys. This was proved by his astounding film 'The Fallen Idol'. But in 'The Third Man' he makes remarkable use of a fascinating little boy with huge eyes who chases Holly Martins down the street as the murderer of his father: this was a hallmark touch of Carol's, to use a child like that to create high drama. I often thought that Carol himself, though a giant, was really a 'little boy who never grew up'. Certainly he understood the world of innocence, which may be one reason why the worm of corruption in the soul of Harry Lime reeks with such overpowering stench in this film, as the antithesis of what Reed himself approved of. In this viewing, Valli appeared harder, more deeply in love with Lime that I had noticed before, more impervious to any other reality than that of his spell. Orson Welles's 'spell' seems to grow with each viewing of this film, as if each time one sees it, more phosphorescent light is emitted by that eerie face so suddenly illuminated in the doorway. And oh, the haunting atmosphere of that deserted postwar city at night! The alleys! And the subterranean river with its sewer drains, of which Carol included so many extra brooding shots, to such great effect. How many 78 rpm records of Anton Karas's theme song were sold? It must have been more than a million. This film has never ceased to live in our imaginations, nor should it.",

But to do so would imply that the film adheres closely to the stylistic and thematic rules of its predecessors, when, put simply, there's never been anything quite like 'The Third Man (1949).' Carol Reed's post-War masterpiece differs from traditional noir in that it is a distinctly British production, equipped with a wry, almost whimsical, sense of humour that places it alongside the Ealing films of the era, particularly 'Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949)' and 'The Lavender Hill Mob (1951).' Set in post-WWII Vienna, the film depicts a crumbling community of wretched thieves and black-market racketeers, effectively capturing the decadence and corruption of a city that has been brought to its knees.

While this website ranks it 48th best movie out of the top 250, and AFI (American Film Institue) has ranked it as high as the 14th best picture out of the top 100 American films ever made, something even more significant looms on the horizon!! Many intellectual spawns of the American film academy have ranked this film in the top five films ever produced!! One prominent critic from Boston ranked ""Third Man"" the number one movie of all time!! So!!! What justifies such critically acclaimed praise anyway? Start with the fact that the intellectual complexities to the plot in ""Third Man"" are intensely riveting!! The esoteric demeanor with which this film carries, has a deliberately convoluted line of logic!! The derivative responses from so many of the characters in this film spark a necessary ambiguity with regards to the prevailing circumstances for whom the third man must relinquish his mystique to!! The conversations pertinent to any kind of plausible resolution to the core issues in this movie were always philosophical!! Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles are a highly classic and highly talented duo of actors (As demonstrated in ""Citizen Kane"") who immediately necessitate a lofty aura of academic concepts. This detailed and contemplative cerebral quandary invites the movie audience to a very noteworthy ideological rumination of the story line in this film. Whether it be ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Third Man"", or any other film, the indisputable mark of the majority of intelligent actors ( Including Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten) is one where they convey the understanding of a situation, and instantly establish whether this situation is really complicated or very simple!! This is about the seventh time I have seen this movie ""The Third Man"" and, I believe, that finally!! I have a grass roots recognition of what this movie is about!! The visceral components to this film induce a correlation to an adamant political passion, as well as, yes, what else? love!! The trials and tribulations of espionage became a form of mutual vindication, thus establishing a kindred spirit for emotional devotion!! Set in Vienna, this film was very identifiable to me, as I have been to Vienna, and I recognize a lot of aspects of splendor to this city. All of it ignited an auspicious recognition; the Gosser Beer signs, the Sacher Cafe', the Mozart concertos with the players wearing wigs, ( I saw a production of this nature while in Vienna!!), and, of course, the cobblestone streets where a cross section of dubious walks of life perennially congregate!! Vienna is a city which is proverbially known to be a hotbed of political malcontents!! Just by virtue of the copious number of summits and dignitary gatherings it has hosted suggests that Vienna is a city which vicariously straddles the political fence!! With the intransigent aftermath of WWII, and the world almost ready to go to war again over the conquest of Berlin in 1948, central Europe had become totally dissected!! By 1949, when ""The Third Man"" was made, the overall infrastructure, which was ruined in Vienna, from confrontational combat during WWII, was ubiquitous!! The city was divided in four sections, belonging to four nations, the American, the British, the Russian, and the French. The center of the city was international, and for Joseph Cotten's character, Vienna presented itself as a mecca for diplomatic intrigue!! I loved this movie!! Based on the screenplay by Graham Greene, this film erupts with talent. Carol Reed ( Known for ""Oliver"" and a remake of ""Mutiny on the Bounty"") does a remarkable job as director with his efforts in the making of ""The Third Man""!! The acting in ""The Third Man"" was utterly superb, basically second to none !! Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten are an unbeatable combination, and Alida Valli, who plays Anna, is flawlessly disconcerting with this role!! The speech Orson Welles made was one which he wrote... the gist of it being (I am paraphrasing)"" War, terror and bloodshed are adversities which brought on greats such as Michaelangelo, Leonardo DaVinci, and the Renaissance, Switzerland has had 500 years of peace and democracy, and all you have gotten out of them is the cuckoo clock"". I thought this little doggerel of Welles' was very impressive!! Orson Welles is a lone rebel cynic who raised the bar on directing and acting excellence, not only in Hollywood, but also, in New York and London Theatre!! Orson Welles has the same birthday as I do, I guess this day was earmarked for brilliant byproducts of unprecedented genius!! (My personal vanity in this case is totally in kidding of course!!) The Hawaiin music in this film served as an aside for anachronistic flippancy with this picture!! The cinematography and lighting in this film were spectacular!! Accomplished actors, directors and producers prefer a movie to be filmed in black and white, as it exudes the absence of distraction!! The film ""Third Man"" is a must see for virtually every movie aficionado on the face of the earth!! I agree with the discerning movie critics, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE!!",

Calloway (Trevor Howard) as well, all others characters were added to assemble a fictional story, what we easily could labeled as just a fine plot with a period, however the cunning director Carol Reed exploited some ponctual elements that improves the movie in another level, first the dark atmosphere at the wet streets in Vienna, with rugged visual, second the sustained use of the camera in angle, given a startling results, third the undeniable charm of Orson Welles as the ambiguous Harry Lime's smile, that now his old pal Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) finally figures out, and to close the unexcelled chase on the large and dark sewage system at Vienna's underground adds values to the movie, further Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) gave a colossal seize on her character, cold and often pondering, who didn't expect that Martin and Anna could be falling in love?

And Dracula himself, a vampire brought back to life from ""death"", dressed all in black, who flees from the light and gorges himself on human blood, yet is a charming fellow withal: fluently fascinating, casually contemptuous, lightheartedly ruthless, cheerfully sinister.

Curious, and increasingly suspicious as the stories become more and more inconsistent, Martins starts a personal investigation into the incident, especially into the identity of the mysterious 'third man' seen carrying Lime's body after the accident. The film is well regarded for its moody, expressionist B/W cinematography, excellent story (based on a book by Graham Greene), fine acting, and tight direction (by Carol Reed). 'The Third Man' was made less than four years after the war in Europe ended and, like 'A Foreign Affair' (1948), there are a number of images of destruction and of people picking up the pieces of their devastated cities as well as numerous references to shortages and of the black market. Much of the film was shot in Vienna and the locations, such as the Josefsplatz (where the hit-and-run occurs) are popular with tourists as are the Wiener Riesenrad (the century old (as of now) Ferris wheel) and the sewers (tours are offered). The film is also remembered for its diverting zither score (by Anton Karas), which became a huge hit in 1949.

But watching this film with the exception of the picture quality (i was watching and old VHS version) this film really could have been made yesterday.

Channeling earlier noir works, it features stark black and white contrast in restricted spaces to give characters a mysterious and isolated feel. The scenes at night and in the sewer are especially notable for the way they frame characters as insignificant in their settings, a theme reflected by Vienna's amoral and cryptic nature. However, the plot and pacing leaves much to be desired, as the first half really is just the author bumbling around asking the same questions over and over again. Even by the end, nothing much has really happened or been revealed - a classic case of style over substance, but the style is worthy of praise in itself.",
95,17 March 2000,terraplane,10," Forget Citizen Kane, This is the best movie ever made.","Whilst Citizen Kane impresses with it's audacity, it has no heart or soul. The Third Man quietly shows Orson's ego trip how it should be done ( and so for that matter does A Touch Of Evil ). Robert Krasker's sublime camera work is still to be marvelled at, including,as it does, some of cinema's most unforgettable images.The lighting on this film is just sheer poetry;shapes,shadows and style. The opening titles with Anton Karas' zither music sets the scene for the masterpiece that follows,from the opening line of "" I never knew the old Vienna..."" to the heartbreaking final two minute scene when the beautiful Alida Valli silently walks past Joseph Cotten in the cemetery while the zither music winds up the tension like a clock spring. There is just no excuse not to reach for the kleenex and have a good weep. There is nothing in this film that can be improved. The script is packed with great lines, the cast ( of mostly obscure international bit-part actors )aren't allowed to detract from the power of the film. The direction is so tight that in places it seems as though the scenes are being ad-libbed. Orson Welles has been justifiably credited for his mesmeric performance as Harry Lime, his first appearance as the window light crosses his face as he stands in the shadow of a doorway still makes the hair stand on my neck. There is no comparable scene in all of cinema. It is a brilliant moment that has been imitated but never bettered.

After the initial gleeful devouring of the canon (about 300 movies), and the joyous stumbling over the odd undiscovered gem, the cineaste must be content with an endless trail of largely diminishing returns.  The only counter against this is brilliant films which never disappoint on the 18th viewing, such as Vertigo, The Wizard Of Oz, The Wild Bunch... ...and The Third Man, a film containing such multitudes that it makes you forget that the majority of British cinema is parochial, unambitious, self-satisfied rubbish.  A great film is by definition a labyrinth: whatever your mood, be it emotional or intellectual, you pick up a new thread of interpretation, and find yourself in places you've never been before, yet by the end, everything still doesn't quite fit, and you have to begin again.

The sparkling, sylphlike strumming makes an ironic, dramatically effective counterpoint to the foreboding atmosphere of a bombed-out Vienna barely recovering from the war.

102,27 January 2012,Tweekums,10, A classic thriller set in post war Vienna,In the years after the war Vienna wasn't a safe place to make a living; but it could be a profitable one. Holly Martins heads there because his friend Harry Lime has told him he can get him a job; there is only one problem; when Holly arrives at his friend's apartment he learns that he was run over and killed ten minutes earlier! The authorities don't seem very sympathetic either; claiming that Harry was a black marketer. Holly doesn't believe this so sets about finding out what happens on Harry's last day; he hears from a friend who was there that Harry had been injured then he and another friend carried him off the road before he died. Another witness however claims that Harry was clearly dead immediately after the accident and there were in fact three people carrying him out of the street who was the third man? As Holly continues to try to find out what happened he befriends Harry's girlfriend Anna although she has problems of her own as the authorities discover that she is using a forged passport. Things get more dangerous when the witness is killed and Holly is suspected and Holly makes a startling discovery about his old friend that I won't spoil here.,

105,1 September 2010,Cosmoeticadotcom,10, Great,"All of the technical aspects of The Third Man are superb, including the cinematography by Robert Krasker, and the memorable scoring by Anton Karas, whose zither music became a mid-century craze. It's truly amazing how much emotion was wrung out of one very particular instrument. The Criterion Collection DVD package has the British version of the film, which is longer (104 to 93 minutes) than the American version, and superior. The British version opens with a voice-over narration by Reed, while the American version's voice-over is by Cotton, as Martins. Aside from a slightly better framing of the film, Reed's voice acts as an anonymous omniscient, whereas Cotton's voice-over sets up the film as possibly being too intimate a viewpoint of Martins. It is a two disk package, and one of the best the company has produced since it went 'lite' in its features, after adopting the semi-circle large C logo. The transfer is shown in a 1.33: aspect ratio, and it's a good print- not perfect, but good. The second disk has many good features, such as a 90 minute long making of documentary called Shadowing The Third Man; an hour long 1968 episode of the British television series Omnibus, featuring an audio interview with Graham Greene- one quite daring in its presentation, called Graham Greene: The Hunted Man; an episode of the radio series The Lives Of Harry Lime; a 30 minute Austrian documentary called Who Was the Third Man?; a Lux Radio Theatre adaptation of the film; Joseph Cotton's American version voice-over for the film; and a few other minor things, including the film's American trailer. There is also a booklet with a few minor essays on the film, from Luc Sante, Charles Drazin, and Philip Kerr. Even better features await on the first disk which, aside from housing the film, has a video introduction by the world's most famous ex-filmmaker, and 'personal' pal of Orson Welles, Peter Bogdanovich, and two audio commentaries on the film. The first is with filmmaker Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Tony Gilroy. They make an odd pair, as neither had any even indirect association with the film. It's enjoyable, as the two banter on in filmese, but compared to Soderbergh's commentary with Lem Dobbs on The Limey, it simply does not compare- probably due to the fact that Gilroy is a hack screenwriter of Hollywood junk, whereas Dobbs is not. Much better is the commentary track by film scholar Dana Polan. As with his review of Angels With Dirty Faces, Polan is thorough, detailed, scene specific, and enthused to the point of never letting any dead spots break through his audio. He has, in the two commentaries I've listened to, proved to be a rival to both film critic Roger Ebert and film director Francis Ford Coppola as the best commentarian going, although he does err in claiming that the blank slate Anna is as important a character in the film as Martins. Overall, it's an excellent package.",

Whether you like or dislike the famed zither music, you will have to admit that it put this film on the map-where it has remained for years as one of the darling selections among most film critics.

You've got the spiral staircase motif initially seen way back in 1929's ""Blackmail"" and later given more profound treatment in 1958's ""Vertigo"". There's also the amusement park background that provided suspense in the latter part of ""Strangers On A Train"". But the thing that really appealed to me was the insertion of a key Hitchcockian element suggested by the movie's title. The 'third man' upon reflection seems to be one of the all time great maguffins of cinema history. In all actuality, there never really was a 'third man', unless one considers Harry Lime to be that character. For that though, he would have had to be at his own 'death' as the unknown individual who helped two other men remove a hit and run victim from the middle of a road.",
112,12 August 2002,jandesimpson,10, Something special for this occasion,"I would like my 50th user comment to celebrate a rather special film, so what better than a thanksgiving for ""The Third Man"". It would go something like this....""'I never knew the old Vienna before the war with its - 'what?"" ""What city is next mentioned?"" ""'That's a nice girl that. But she ought to be careful in Vienna....' Who is speaking and what is the next line?"" ""'Mr Martins, what author has chiefly influenced you?' How does he reply and what is the response?""...And so it would go on. Time - circa 1950; place - a grammar school North-West of London; speakers - a group of 6th formers during a school break testing each other's knowledge about their latest cinematic discovery. If we had known the term ""cult film"" in those days ""The Third Man"" would have been ours. We were just a little too young to have been affected by ""Casablanca"", ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""The Big Sleep"" and ""Citizen Kane"" did not really become known in this country until way after it was made. No, ""The Third Man"" was ours and I still think it as light-years away from the others I have mentioned in quality. We saw it on every available occasion and it was not long before I had chalked up ten viewings. Imagine my excitement when I was staying with my French exchange partner and he suggested we go to a cinema in Angers to see ""Le Troisieme Homme"". It was great sharing it with him and his mother and as I almost knew the dialogue by heart by then, I understood every word. in spite of my limited French. Just a few reflections many years on about a work that has been part of my experience for almost as long as I can remember. I could go on at great length about those tremendous set-pieces, Harry Lime's appearance in the doorway, Holly Martin's disastrous performance at the literary meeting, the ride on the Ferris wheel and the sewer chase, but it has all been said before. In any case visual and dramatic bravura alone do not make for greatness. ""The Third Man"" is a masterpiece because it states, or rather understates, some most perceptive things about the human condition. It is really a film about unrequited love. In a work where chases predominate it is the pursuit by Holly Martins for the affection of Anna Schmidt, Lime's lover, that is at the real heart of things. It is impossible to understand human chemistry, why Anna should be attracted to the amoral and ruthless Harry rather than kindly Holly who wants so much to give. But then there is an even greater irony inasmuch as Holly too is drawn to Harry; after all they have been friends since boyhood. When Harry is finally cornered it is Holly who pulls the trigger that puts him out of his misery, like an act of kindness to a wounded beast. Carol Reed was at the height of his powers when he made ""The Third Man"", but he still had something almost as great to give before his slow decline. Perhaps I shall save the wondrous ""Outcast of the Islands"" for my hundredth offering.",

Is there much point in me offering any thoughts at all though? In all honesty, no not really, but I'll give it a go. It's a bright and breezy opening. Bar the funeral of Mr Harry Lime, who our hero novelist Mr Holly Martins has travelled to post war Vienna to see. An unlucky start for both, perhaps signalled by Martins' walking under a ladder to enter Lime's apartments. He finds the city a complex place, filled with complex characters and politics that are anything but. Policemen Major Calloway thinks Lime was 'mixed up in a racket', which really is a beautiful cover all for crime in the 40s. Lime was his by a car, an accident, supposedly. Martins of course, looks to unpick the story. A classic aftermath film, the unseen event happening before the picture starts, we're left to try and make sense of it all. Martins sets about trying to get to the bottom of events that he feels sure has much more to it. Was it an accident, why were so many people linked to Lime there, seemingly by happenstance. And who is the one person who's not, The Third Man, only seen by one man, the porter. It looks beautiful of course, even in black and white it oozes European style. Gorgeous camera angles, colourful characters, it's all here. The cast though is the shining light. From Baron Kurtz, his small dog and devilish smile to Dr Winkle, sorry Vinkle, also with a small suspiciously similar dog. The crazy German landlady and even the small child that accuses Martins of murdering the porter leaps off the screen. No longer a mere by stander, Martins now finds himself in night time chases through bombed out streets, shadows of goons looming high on cathedral walls. It's the balance of action, intrigue and romance. Martins falling for Lime's girl Miss Schmidt, who herself has issues with the various authorities, that keeps this motoring along. Lime's is far from innocent in all this and when (spoiler alert) he steps on screen well... the reveal of Orson Welles and that wry smile gets me every time. Considering he doesn't turn up as the missing Harry until the final act, he really does steel the show. It's a test of friendships in desperate times. Constant tension reigns throughout, like the near ever present ukulele or whatever that is that accompanies the echoey footsteps on dark cobbled streets. The sewage chase finale, begins to feel like an Escher as the angles and shadows cut beautifully. It's not nearly as complicated as it'll have you believe at the outset, but it is nothing short of cinematic perfection.",

130,30 November 2021,barryrd,8, Original post-war story with great style,"The Third Man is a fascinating movie with superb photography. The story follows Joseph Cotten as Holly Martins to post-war Vienna where he is looking for an old friend named Harry Lime, played by Orson Welles. It should be pointed out that crime and the black market are running wild in Vienna at the time. Lime doesn't show up as expected and Martins is told that Lime is dead, as a result of an accident. Martins strongly suspects something is amiss and Lime is at the top of the police hit list. Conflicting versions of the accident send him on a long chase. He even attends a funeral for his friend. One would think this is the final word on Lime's whereabouts; however, the chase continues. Through the backstreets and alleyways of Vienna, the audience sees some excellent shots, almost like a series of great photographs in black and white. The realist atmosphere is reinforced by the darkness, shadows, and damp cobblestone streets of the once glamorous capital of Vienna. A frantic chase through the underground sewer system and a ride on the famed Ferris wheel are part of this fast paced movie. There are many fine cast members like Valli, as Harry's former female companion, not to mention the chief of police played by Trevor Howard, as well as Wilfrid Hyde-Whyte and Bernard Lee. (Lee would later become ""M"", James Bond's London espionage contact.) All in all, a movie that movie buffs should consider seeing. It is often included among the greatest films of all time. To me it's a very good movie that ranks in the top 100. A great art house movie but not the greatest of all time.",

Every detail is perfect too. Many are unrepeatable. We will never see bombed out Vienna again, and certainly not like Carol Reed showed it. Then there is Holly Martins, the pulp fiction writer in a pulp fiction noir movie written by Graham Greene, and Orson Welles with the best entrance in the history of movies and just one scene where he talks, but he talks for eternity.

137,15 August 2015,ryansrusso,10, A Classic That Will Stand The Test of Time,"Carol Reed's The Third Man (1949) is a remarkable film noir that if you haven't seen, you most certainly should. Set in postwar Vienna, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) arrives to visit an old friend who had offered him a job. From there the twisty, fast paced ride begins with the first twist being thrown at you in under ten minutes. The film aged very well, and even if you don't usually watch black and white movies, this one should be made an exception. Although the movie deals with lots of dark themes such as murder, corruption, and the Black Market, it is portrayed in a comical way, especially due to the performances and unique score. The fast paced dialogue, perfectly timed music, and direction all add to the films wit and pace. There are lots of short shots, dutch angles, jump cuts to keep you engaged and you are never bored or unsatisfied. The cinematographer certainly earned his paycheck because the films cinematography is unbelievable. With each transition you are prepared for a little more of the truth and intrigue to be revealed so you can try to figure out the mystery before the ending. And may I add that the finale is one of the greatest you'll ever see. The classic sewer chase sequence will stick with you forever. In conclusion, The Third Man is a film that must be seen if you are a fan of mysteries, classics films, and interested in seeing truly one of the best films (One of Roger Ebert's top 4).",

You can only see gestures in his face, and it's a terrific acting, without a single word. The unforgettable zither score of Anton Karas did not win an Oscar nor even a nomination, but Robert Krasker's skill in photography did.

It is for this reason that acclaimed writer Graham Greene gave full freedom to his creative imagination by creating a character who belonged to the world of literature. It is the writer who emerges as the ultimate hero of the film by sacrificing his friendship for the greater glory of humanity. British film 'The Third Man' revived the sordid atmosphere of wartime Vienna where the growth of black market gave rise to various criminal activities. It was a time which witnessed an absolute dearth of ethical practices in business as black marketers chose to earn huge sums of money by using unfair means.

Here's where Graham Greene's screenplay was strictly Cold War boilerplate: The Russians were necessarily the ""bad guys,"" prepared to harbor a scumbag like Lime and persecute a sensitive soul like ""Anna Schmidt"" (maybe she'd been the lover of a high-ranking Nazi commander of a death camp and had shared in his sadistic delights).

Although, by the end he has matured somewhat. The heroine is mad. How could anybody love a man (Welles) who's put dozens of children in hospital? She's awful. Cinematography is exceptional. Tilted shots and the use of shadow and reflection is truly staggeringly well done. Not a single shot was overdone. Perhaps that's what made this film so amazing.

So many amazing shots in this movie, especially in the sewers and that great shot of the old man with the balloon's shadow, absolutely amazing.

Harry has a penchant for Russians and sewers (which go together like ""love and marriage""). His mistress Anna is head over heels for him, and her passion waxes even stronger when she learns that he has been maiming children behind her back.

American serial killer Ted Bundy was kind of cute, and had dozens of victims among the ""fair sex,"" who in turn left hundreds of chagrined and rejected homelier, less cocky, non-Romeos in their wakes.

It would be in the top 10 in many different categories: direction, cinematography (some of the expressionistic compositions are breathtaking), editing, music (the solo zither was a masterstroke), best introduction of a character (Harry Lime), best climax (in the sewers), best closing shot (what a risk Reed took with that long take), best monologue (Welles on the ferris wheel).  All this is at the service of a fascinating story: a large cast of great characters (all the way down to the babbling old landlady in Anna's building), lots of twists, good irony, witty dialogue.  I don't agree with previous writers that the story is hard to follow.  I think it develops quickly, logically, and clearly.   Anna is a mysterious character, but she was meant to be that way.

His entrance is an unforgettable scene - the ""late"" Harry Lime is caught in a spotlight on a dark Viennese street. As we watch, his expression changes from jaunty arrogance to quivering fear. Later, as he rationalizes his crimes for Martens (Joseph Cotten) during a Ferris wheel ride, he is the epitome of post-war cynicism. The relationship between Welles's and Cotten's characters in this film reminded me of their roles in ""Citizen Kane"", where Cotten has to state the truth or remain loyal to a friend. Other images remain with me after viewing - the loud-mouthed little boy accusing Martens of murder, the old balloon seller appearing out of the night, and the eerie, hypnotic zither music forever in the background. Finally, the climactic chase scene through the sewers of Vienna is one of the most striking black-and-white sequences this side of ""Potemkin.""",

However, the international police force are investigating Harry for racketeering and are not convinced he is dead ",
198,1 May 2006,silverscreen888,7," Beautifully Photographed and Directed; Artistic, Seminal and Overrated","While I regard the ""Third Man"" as artistic, very strongly so, in the sense of being ""minimally graphically depicted, filled with memorable images and intelligently photographed,I disagree,for many reasons, with calling it more than very good. I review the film here because its artistic successes have been much imitated, as have elements of its storyline. The story of ""The Third Man"" can be stated simply. ""A writer of genre westerns travels to Vienna to find his boyhood friend Harry Lime, at Lime's request. He discovers the man has recently died, a fact attested by several of Lime's friends. The local occupation force's leader, whom he seeks out to ask about the death, warns him to stay away from the case, that Lime was a thoroughly bad sort. Deciding to investigate the death and perhaps clear his friend's name, or at least prove the authorities were wrong about Lime, the writer becomes involved with Lime's girl friend, finds rumors of Lime's death were exaggerated, then must face a final crisis--what to do about the man."" Acting in the film is decidedly uneven, I assert. As the writer, Joseph Cotten captures the man's psyche but he does not sound like a writer of westerns. As Lime, Orson Welles is understated, quirky, powerful at times and generally perhaps believable. Trevor Howard as the head of the authorities is not as strong as he soon will be in a series of 1950s triumphs, while Alida Valli as the girlfriend seems the best feature of the film, visually and professionally. Unfortunately, owing to the noir nature of the writer's central role--he cannot ask the police for help, since he is ignoring their assessment of Lime's bad character--and to his being a stranger in Vienna, the characters he meets remain intelligently defined but on the adventure level of types and acquaintances. Even Lime's friends cannot be individuated; so that the best scenes in the film, by my standards, occur when Cotten or Valli has something specific to do--she being questioned by police or he by literary overly-intellectual zealots, he chasing after her, or she telling him he does not understand his old friend. Lime ,at one point, revealing himself to the man he had sent for, defends his action in committing black market crimes; he famously likens the people (whose lives he is destroying) to ""ants"" he is stepping on, which is what people glimpsed from the top of a Ferris Wheel upon which he and the writer are riding look like from that remove.. The motive for Lime's needing to disappear after being found out as the perpetrator of a deadly dangerous fraud seems more real to the viewer, I claim, than does his idea that he might get away with such a crime for any length of time. This I found to be quite unconvincing. And it goes to the heart of three matters--why Lime sent for his old friend, what he thought he was doing and how convincing is the entire plot. But the shadow-haunted, textured B/W quality of the scenes filmed, the over-used but generally splendid Anton Karas' zither accompaniment and the artistry with which director Carol Reed has presented his story are the triumphs of the project. Credit for the artfulness belongs to cinematographer Robert Krasker, set decorator Darion Simoni, assistant director Guy Hamilton and others such as art director Joseph Bata, Ferdinand Bellan, Vincent Korda, John Haworth and James Sawyer.",

All of the actors, fine performers in their own right, seem to have peaked in this movie. I have not read the Graham Greene novel but I would have to believe that, contrary to the usual book/movie comparisons, this movie has surpassed the book. I say this partly because of the almost dreamlike scenes and camera angles , something of a signature of Welles' work, and partly because of the hauntingly lovely strains of Anton Karas' zither, tying one scene to another and delicately enveloping the whole work. A book cannot do that. I don't know how many times I have seen this movie but, like a fine painting, I see it again at each opportunity.

225,25 September 2005,guidon7,10, A Masterpiece in It's Own Right,"I am not going to rehash what has been said in other comments other than that Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten were at their best. Rather, an aside or two about the film. At the time Welles was trying to make his own films and took the Harry Lime role only for the money. Anton Karras, the zither player, was found in a dingy, cellar cafe in Vienna. Becoming well known for the background music and then his ""Third Man Theme"" record which was a tremendous hit worldwide, he was talked into opening a nightclub in London. Even though the nightclub was successful, Karas yearned for his former life and packed it in, going back underground to the cellar cafe in Vienna to play his zither. In one scene in the film Cotten has finished a talk on American writers. He runs up the hotel stairs pursued by two assassins and enters an empty hotel room. He exits a window, but not before being bitten on a finger by a parrot. I suspect that this ""nip"" was not in the script, but it resulted in the only amusing scene in the entire film. When asked by military policeman Trevor Howard why his finger was bandaged, Cotten replies ""A parrot bit me"", invoking an exasperated reply from Howard. I believe this to be the only funny scene in the film and it was over very quickly. Interestingly there was no novel or play that the film was based on. Graham Green was asked to do a screenplay for a film idea, which he did. Who knows? If this was done more often as opposed to films based on books or plays we might have a better variety of films for our viewing these days.",

While watching this movie it made me think of a Paul Newman movie that I reviewed this past April called Absence of Malice (1981) because they both had sort of similar stories but with different plots.The scene that I think a lot of people including myself find most surprising is the scene where Anna's cat exits the house through a window and is by somebody's feet, and Martins says ""Come out, Come out whoever you are."" and he finds out is is Harry with an excited expression on his face for getting away with foul play, and with thinking that this whole case is a joke.This movie is on a par with some of the best film-noir movies ever made for example Sunset Blvd.(1950), Touch of Evil (1958), The Maltese Falcon (1941) etc. And one brilliant performance in this movie that I forgot to mention and that was Trevor Howard's as the commanding police officer in that case.

229,31 December 2006,adrian-193,10, The Third Man and the Logical Third,"The film's title, The Third Man, announces that it's about triangulation. Shot in brilliant film noir black and white, and set on location in the ruined post-war city of Vienna, the film explores and unfolds mediated relations and on several levels. Most obviously are the interpersonal relations between the film's main characters a woman's (Alida Valli, played by Anna Schmidt) two incomplete paramours, specifically: one actual but absent Harry Lime (Orson Welles), the other a present but only potential lover, Rollo Martins (Joseph Cotten). But the film also explores the indirect and shady economic relations of the black market, and the equally gray morality that seems a necessary means of coping with relations steered from the straight and narrow. Any one of these three themes could make a movie. But the Third Man's brilliance is in its success at playing out its themes using each mode of cinematic expression (story, image, sound). Much of the film is shot with dutch angles (an angled camera, which puts the frame askew). Rollo Martins, a straight up American visiting old friend Harry LIme (whom we don't find till the end of the film), is framed straight up and down. But as he begins to encounter an underground economy (and the film's conclusion is indeed shot in the city's drainage system) of barter, favors, bribes and corruption, the frame tilts. Scenes shot in alley ways also tell of perilous and shadowy pastimes and night times. Scenes featuring our heroine frame her, literally, in windows and doors (though she's not the only one who's framed). The moral choices our hero faces can only bend if he is to find his friend or get the girl (it's not clear which it will be, but by convention he oughtn't get either until he makes the right choice, that is to say, morally right--the right kind of choice according to the film). While Valli refuses to compromise her principles, even at the risk of deportation to the Russian sector (she's Czech), Martins makes trades to keep her in Vienna. And Martins, rather than allow Valli contact with Lime (her lover presumed dead), keeps them apart in order to save her for himself. What Martins tells her, and Lime, is never clearly, nor completely true. The world of film noir is a world in which choices are hazy and relations, being alliances, are subject to change. But our lead actors survive temptations to uphold the genre conventions. It's not till the 50's that heroes, sheriffs, cops, and detectives become morally ambiguous (or ambivalent: Eastwood was not a Wayne). The shift takes interesting shape in gangster films with themes of betrayal. Gangster films began as cops-and-robbers films, in which the contrast of moral choices was portrayed in the high contrast of black and white. But the gang, and a mafia in particular, is a family. The crime of family betrayal (whether to the cops, or to another gang) replaces the black and white of moral distinctions to become the source of tension in films like the Godfather, Casino, and Donnie Brasco. The Third Man's theme of triangulation is where the psychology of indirect relations really comes into the limelight. Philosopher Gilles Deleuze observes that the logic of Alfred Hitchcock's suspense is not the whodunit of a crime, but its ""for whom was it done."" He reveals plot points to the camera (and thus the audience) that are concealed from the film's characters. In fact the audience sometimes knows who has committed the crime from the very beginning; what's not known is the characters' relations to the crime, or its perpetrators, and this unsettles their relations to one another. Their relations are then developed according to the film's logical puzzle (as opposed to their emotional or real relations to one another). In the Third Man the position of third is not fixed but circulates. All relations are not equal, and in the Third Man, Martins, Lime, and Valli must choose their relationships to one another on the basis of muddled events, a shadowy underworld's downward gravitational pull, obfuscating facts and the incomplete observations of witnesses--honest and dishonest alike. Direct relations have difficulty flourishing in a world of indirect and convenient allegiances. But the romantic story-line requires the directness of communication (affection expects honesty and sincerity). If Martins' courtship of Valli is to succeed, he must leave his triangulations and draw a straight and direct line to her. As the film nears its incredible showdown--a standout moment in film-making on its own--the audience knows Martins is facing an almost impossible choice as a friend (to LIme) and lover (not yet but hoping to become for Valli). He must reveal the truth about Lime to the police if he wants Valli to see him. But he must take his action without the supporting angles of a triangle (angled shots of a dutch camera = the geometry of triangles?). It's a decision he can only take alone. And this is how it plays out. He takes the gun in his own hands and without the cover of the police in the waterways with him, confronts Lime for his immorality. He pulls the trigger, his act resounding with an echo against concrete tunnel walls, and in the back lit white of a dark passage way, Martins, now looking much a Western hero, walks his straight line back to the world above. We do not know if he gets the girl. The film begins with Martins noticing Valli, who is walking a straight line directly down the center of a straight road. He meets her again on the same road, after the same burial (this time it is Lime's body in the ground, put to rest where he belongs), and she doesn't look his way. The audience, however, knows that he is now on the same path, and that his choices have made him a candidate, at least, for a position in a romantic partnership.",
230,4 February 2020,Andy_MJD,3, Pfffff...,"A movie for which I've never understood the hype. I found the story to be slow (as a fair few movies from this period seem to be (especially when compared to modern-day action movies, but is that a fair comparison? It's a different audience, after all). The main villain is dreadfully shallow, ""I am evil for the sake of being evil"", but not twisted or demented in any interesting fashion like Heath Ledger's Joker from the Dark Knight trilogy. An example of very slow pacing is how long the sewer chase scene lasts: easily 10 minutes. 600 seconds of nothing but splish-splash, I'm running from the cops, and there's no real sense of danger, because the cops never really catch up, or when they do the villain outplays them so easily that it feels anticlimactic, comical even, and overall after a few minutes it loses its edge and is simply boring to watch. The best part was the end when he's caught, and even then I have to watch him run away from barking manholes once or twice. I can't remember the plot or the motivations or the characters or the actors. I very simply didn't enjoy it.",

The script, the setting, the cast, the acting, the cinematography, all are superior. I particularly like two things about the film: One is the post-WW II venue, which contributes to the story's intrigue as well as providing historical, cultural, and scenic value. Another is the fact that the story is not as predictable as the viewer might expect. Those of us who critique every film we see always will find something--however minor--to criticize, but this film is well done in every respect. It's a definite classic, one that belongs in every film buff's library. I prefer the British version to the American, just because it's the original, but either way it's hard to go wrong on The Third Man.",

240,13 September 1998,Buzz-17,9, Menacing Presence,"This evening I have finally watched a film that I have always wanted to see- The Third Man. To me it lived up to my expectations. The first thing I loved about this film was the composition of shadow/light and the actors. They dared to show things not in their most pretty way, but in their most desperate form. It allows us to really feel the tension of ""the pre-coldwar"" in Vienna. I think Joseph Cotton is such a natural actor; he never forces his lines or attempts to overact. All of his lines are said with clarity and conviction of character. He is as likable an actor as Jimmy Stewart. By far however,  my  favorite part of the film is the ferris wheel ride. Orson Welles could provide such a menacing presence. Here the subtlety of his acting (as in The Stranger) added to the tension.  Was he going to throw his friend out of the ride? His eyes revealed his character so delicately. The subtle glances and narrowed eyes conveyed his potential for evil. It is amazing to me too, with cameras having been so bulky, that they were able to shoot the subterranian world of the sewer. Film also tended to be slow back then as well, and the use of light there is amazing. I agree with AFI, this is one of our treasures.",
241,19 February 2002,raif,10, Didn't Know What to Expect,When the Criterion DVD came out I bought this movie.  I think I remember seeing bits and pieces of it many years ago when I was a little kid.  I watched the original trailer for this movie.  At first I was a little worried.  Anton Karas' rough sounding zither was not what I imagined a movie like the Third Man would have for its theme.  It is funny how trailers have evolved just over the past 20 years.  I had calmed myself down and prepared to watch this film with an open mind.  I had read so many reviews of this movie and heard the praises.  So many said that even though it was made in the late 40's it had a look and feel of a film of the late 50's to early 60's.  They were right.  This movie kept my attention and played with my imagination all the way to the end.  It is also funny to look at the scene when Harry Lime is revealed for the first time and to remember standing in that same spot in Vienna at 16 so many years ago and not know why your crazy German Teacher is going nuts and taking pictures.  Also at the end I had realized that my initial judgement of Karas' zither was incorrect.  It helped define the movie and especially Orson Welles' Harry Lime.  This movie is film-noir at its best.,
242,30 March 2006,epeck15,10, Cheers For The Great Joseph Cotten,"Like most people who post reviews on this site, I love movies. I'm not a professional reviewer, but I've seen lots of movies in my day. And from that vast list, most of which has long since faded into my mind's oblivion, a very few stand out. Casablanca. Chinatown. The Godfathers. Bridge On The River Kwai. Annie Hall. The Third Man stands in that company, and maybe at the front. This site contains so many excellent reviews of this movie and its cinematography, its music, its Graham Greene-inspired plot and dialogue. I won't try to re-do what so many reviews have already done. No, I'm writing this comment to honor Joseph Cotten. This movie will always be associated in the first instance with Orson Welles, who, as most readers will know by now, is on screen for but a few minutes. And while those minutes may represent the most memorable small role in the history of cinema, it's Joseph Cotten who carries this movie. His performance as the bumbling, naive, yet ultimately heroic Holly Martins, is perfect. It's an incredibly demanding role, because in order for the movie to work, we have to see Holly as childlike in his adoration of the evil Harry Lime (played by Welles), adolescent in his pursuit of Lime's bereaved girlfriend, slippery enough to have been Lime's one-time running mate, yet clever enough to unravel a mystery that's fooled the cynical British army cop, Major Calloway, played brilliantly by Trevor Howard. And all that and more, we have to like him. Cotten, who is in virtually every frame of the movie, pulls it off. Nowadays, little is written about Joseph Cotten. Maybe it was his man-on-the-street looks. More likely, he'll always be seen as a lesser satellite in Welles' galaxy. Pity, because he was great, and his performance as Holly Martins in The Third Man, is fantastic.",

As many times as I have seen TTM (somewhere between 25 and 30 times), it never occurred to me that of course, this must have happened.

I hadn't really paid attention to anything else, so when Joseph Cotton appeared on screen, I was surprised but pleased, mainly because I recognised him from Citizen Kane as well. Over the next 100 mins or so he went on to prove himself one of the best screen actors I've ever seen, easily comparable with his co-stars: it's fair to say that Orson Welles dominates the film, but arguably Joseph Cotton dominates the screen. Add in to this Trevor Howard, an often overlooked but talented actor, and Valli, who is captivatingly melancholic, plus the absolutely brilliant final sequence, and you end up watching a great, great film. It's just a shame that the finest British film ever made dates back to 1949: couldn't we have gone on to even better things? To be honest, who cares: just sit down and watch this!",

I first saw this at a young age when it was just ""an old film on the telly"" filling in a vacant slot and it gripped me from beginning to end. Intelligent film making at its very best with great story telling, atmospheric photography and music perfectly capturing the immediate post war chaos of a shattered city with masterly direction from Carol Reed to top off Graham Greene's screenplay. All the performances are excellent, but my particular favourite is Trevor Howard as the world weary Major Calloway who steals the film even from Orson Welles.

There is no such thing as a flawless film; TTM takes a little while to get going and has initial dips but once it gets going all those flaws are forgotten. Drawing together shadows, mystery, thrills, twists, history and technical wizardry, TTM is a nail biting, rattling roller coaster ride of a movie flying which more often than not threatens to dive off the rails.

This is the only perfect movie ever made. I guess most of the great things about photography and charisma and zither theme and story have been said by people far more articulate than I.

Firstly, the camera angles seem to be designed to preclude the viewer from ever being comfortable in involvement with what is not meant to be a comfortable story.

Halfway through the film I wish there had been a way to shut the music off and keep the dialogue on!  The best thing about this is the direction.  Director Reed constantly keeps the viewer off balance by shooting numerous scenes at a tilted angle establishing a sense of paronia and uneasiness.  Very rarely is something shoot at the correct angle.  Also, the set design is stunning. The movie is set in Vienna, but was shot in London.  You'd never know it. It looks and FEELS like Vienna.  The sets are huge and crumbling (result of WWII) and increase the feeling of dread.  Also excellent use of night and shadow.  Some of these sequences wouldn't be out of place in a horror film.

One of moments in cinema when all the components add up to more than the sum. Daringly angled shots, against the ruins of grand houses add a wonderful and fitting backdrop as shattered humans play out their parts. The Zither of Anton Karas is perfect, one of those serendipitous moments that can not be repeated.

288,17 February 2021,jon_pratt12345,7, Pure noir with a bizarre soundtrack,Set around the mysterious death of a well known local figure in post war Vienna. The film sets you up to distrust everyone with various competing international and personal agendas creating tension and is often shot off kilter giving an uneasy feeling. The motivations of the lead characters were sometimes unconvincing as they participated in the mystery with fluctuating commitment but the acting and story were good enough to overlook this. Less easy to overlook was the upbeat musical score which a friend described as sounding like it was from a bad Italian restaurant; it played relentlessly throughout the film regardless of what was happening on screen which was off-putting at times.

Basically, a guy named Holly Martins visits post war Vienna after recieving a job offer from a friend, only to find his friend dead, and himself sucked into the mystery. Everything about this movie is memorable; the tilted camera angles, the zither music score, the fantastic villain performance by Orson Welles (who only appears for about 10 minutes, and steals the show). All of the mystery and dialogue between the characters plays perfectly into the theme of confusion and suspicion evoked by the post-war vienna setting, as well as the theme of morality. Holly Martins is a character who is simultaneously a genius and an idiot; he's clever, and willing to get involved, but bumbles through the mystery because he's getting involved where he shouldn't. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over again, getting something new every time.",

It's unusual that I can pinpoint these things, but I realized that Orson Welles' cool portrayal of Harry Lime is the reason why. Not cool as in hip, mind you, cool as in unperturbed. Selling placebo medicines on the black market to desperate people in post ww2 Vienna, Harry fakes his own death so that he may operate under the radar. He feels almost total indifference towards his victims, which is the surprise of this story. Most war stories of the day tell you very heavy-handedly who the bad guy is, but Harry Lime is a likable looking guy, who, despite his indifference, bears no malice towards anyone. Do we despise his callousness or succumb to his innate charm & moxie? It's unusual that a movie from this era will let you decide that for yourself, much less make it so that you must.",

Suspected foul play Martins is torn between loyalty between is friend and the harsh realty that his friend is a crook and he has fallen in love with Harry's girl, Anna (alida Valli).

He determines to try and find out just quite what happened. It becomes harder and harder for ""Holly"" to get straight answers - even from those whom he ought to be able to rely upon - ""Maj.

Pinpricks of light from cigarettes in the shadows, shifting bodies hugging the dimly lit doorways - and he begins to realise that maybe his friend was not quite as scrupulous and honourable as he might have wished or appeared. Right from Anton Karas playing the distinctive zither theme at the top of the film we are treated to a wonderfully evocative adaptation of Graham Greene's mystery thriller and Carol Reed really does well with the pace of this too. We do make progress, but ""Holly"" has to work hard - as do we - for it, and his shady protagonists remain in the shadows, really effectively.

The writing was pretty decent but not great as even for a film made in the 40s it seems so outworn, the same could also be said for the performances. Speaking of the performances Orson Welles may have been the only above average part to it. Going back to the story I just didn't find it entertaining and it never aroused my curiosity leaving me to hang in a lifeless and way too stretched out mess of a plot that eventually leads to somewhere which doesn't deserve the build up in any way shape or form.

Welles especially, as the mysterious Harry Lime, personifies evil even more effectively (if that's possible) than characters such as Anthony Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs) or Andy Robinson (Dirty Harry). Who can forget Lime's words spoken from the top of Vienna's ferris wheel about being paid for stopping those ""dots below"" (people) from moving or his Italy & Renaissance v  Switzerland & cuckoo clock comparison. Simply, a ""must see"" film.",

337,7 December 2001,Tobot,10, The perfect film,"What can I say? I guess it's summed up with the Zither music of Anton Karas, playing as the credits roll. The simple theme will stay in your head for days after you've left the theatre, one detail that's so light and fun you can't help but be charmed. So it is with every other detail of the film, actors with 5 lines seem like fully fleshed characters, and setpieces as simple as a sewer entrance are exotic little touches that make postwar Vienna seem almost like an alien world. Unlike the ""classic"" films of the last 20 years, The Third Man has no opinions on god, or death, it has no broad message, it's just a story. Just a single, luminous, story.",
338,5 February 2002,Charles Foster Kane,10," In Vienna they had Orson Welles,Joseph Cotten & Carol Reed, what did that produce? The Third Man (just as good as ""Kane"",but more fun)","As we all know, Citizen Kane is often lauded ""Greatest Film of All Time"". Whilst I would never dispute this, keep in mind that ""Best"" doesn't mean the same as ""Favourite"". Kane is influential, important and is required viewing for anyone with even a cursory interest in film. However, it can be a difficult watch if your not in the right mood. The Third Man, on the other hand, is a joy from start to finish. From the (perfectly) cast to Robert Krasker's outstanding cinematography, the film persists in staggering me every time. Technically speaking, The Third Man is on a par with Citizen Kane and rarely gets the credit for it. The reason for this is simply because,  whatever skill,craft and/or effort was displayed for the film, it is unobtrusive. All the composite elements (photography,design,editing etc) seem so perfectly suited to eachother, to the point where they're rendered almost ""invisible"". However, whilst watching Citizen Kane, you're always conscious of it being such a (staggeringly) well put together film. Which seems, to me, to run counter to the whole ""Magic of Cinema"" thing. The ""Magic of Cinema"" thing being where you can let go and enter the world you're being presented with. Which becomes increasingly more difficult, the more you're aware of the technicalities of filmaking, however impressive they may be. So, sit back and enjoy quite the finest example of ""Romantic Thrillers""........ The Third Man. My favourite film, though not necessarily the best.",

THE THIRD MAN, Carol Reed's classic from 1949, can be considered one of the first ""Method movies""; certainly Orson Welles' acting in the great Ferris Wheel scene is more naturalistic than your typical 1940's acting, and the slanting camera angles and evocative shadows lend this film an artistic, poetic quality lacking in many potboilers of the era. Graham Greene's script for THE THIRD MAN too has literary quality and depth; in classic film noir fashion, it presents a cynical, pessimistic view of life in which humanity is caught in a web of deceit, upright moral actions do not yield a story-book ending, and a woman would rather be true to a dead lover and his corrupt values than wake up to a better love that awaits her. The powerful, expressive imagesa fleeing shadow down an alleyway, a long tree-lined road past a cemetery, a puff of silver smoke from a train, the dying Harry Lime's hands grasping at life through a sewer grate, as well as that magnificent underground network itselfwill haunt you, and you will feel enriched by this superb film.",

Everything that you can know about this film leads it to be more intriguing, but even watching it without knowing anything of its history it still fascinates and judging from all these comments that people keep on seeming to write it continues to cause the greatests divides since the invention of long division. Basically it is a film about a racketeering spy, whose faked death rouses an old friend into searching for the true answers. There are many different ways to interpret it further as discussed in other comments here, however I see it as a discussion of duality - between loyalty and betrayal, between the disgust for what Harry does and the need for him to continue, the public minded reporter of Cotten and the secret reports of the spies... all carried on across the divided war-torn city of Vienna, halfway between the polar opposite philosophies of her conquerors at the crossroads of Europe and at a time when the future still hung in the balance.",

As much as it was a great soundtrack and as a stand alone soundtrack I would not be surprised if it could land really high in the rankings, but as a movie soundtrack it did not mesh with me. There were multiple scenes where the music brought me out of the scene because it contrasted with the tone of the scene so much. I think a lot of people will hate me for saying this about the soundtrack and I understand how it adds to the whole feel of Vienna, but it did not work for me. A scene with a lot of suspense would be ruined with an upbeat bouncy song. The acting was fine and the story was really good. I loved the title of the film and how it played so well with the story and the way the events were revealed in the movie. I loved the ending and it was a great shot. So like any mystery noir movie like this is really dependent on the script and it did a fantastic job with revealing the truth to the viewer. So two things that need to be address when talking about this movie is the cinematography and direction. I love the way Vienna was caught on film and I really feel as if the noir genre benefits from black and white. The film makers were able to transform Vienna into a dark place filled with shadow and secrets. I also loved the direction and how Reed kept choosing to tilt the camera and skewing the picture. It just added to the whole feel of the movie. I kept trying to use it as a clue to the story, but it evaded me on the first viewing.

The audience is carried through the mystery as an outsider, following Cotton's Holly Martins as he learns of his friend's death and things not adding up. If I am to be critical, some of the sewer chases are a bit tedious, but they do not take away from the film. And what surely has to be one of the best reveals in film history.

⚪
All in all, this Carol Reed adaptation of Graham Greene's famous novel ingeniously digs up a complex and multifaceted mystery from the ruins of Vienna, and thanks to an eclectically composed and twisted story, extreme historical accuracy and atmospheric and magnificently captured set pieces, it, despite some issues with the musical score, becomes a brilliantly crafted and moody crime thriller that definitely is one of the best film noirs ever made.
⚪
On Sunday I was able to finally finish the Graham Green novel, and I gotta to say, I had a blast. Since I consider myself a history buff and love everything concerning the past, this book was probably made for me. A thriller taking place in the occupied, snowbound, post-war Vienna, a place that once has been one of the most beautiful capitals of the continent and then was nothing but a devastated ruin? Seriously, it already hit me while I was reading the pages, hence I couldn't hardly wait to see the film that supposedly is the finished version of the project. ""Finished version?"" you may ask, and yes that has a meaning to it. In the foreword, the author explains that his novelette was never supposed to be published and only served as some kind of prototype for the screenplay he was about to write for the film his friend Carol Reed would go on to direct, and it is palpable that is only a rough draft for what the film would eventually be. In merely one-hundred and forty pages, he rushes through the story that is, of course, further elaborated in the movie version. If they had followed the book step by step, the film would have been only an hour long, and that of course would have been a poor adaptation. Fortunately, the film stayed truth to the basic outline, and all changes were for the better. Some characters were replaced by others, some names were changed (the protagonist was called Rollo Martins in the novel!) and the conflicts between the characters became more realistic and comprehensible. Technically, there is nothing wrong with this film as an adaptation. Except for one or two things. ""One or two things?"" you may interpose, and yes, there two minimal aspects I was dissatisfied with. First, in the novel it was described that the whole story takes place in the deathly cold, snow covered streets of the bombed Austrian capital, in this film, the snow part is missing completely, and even if it is not that big of a deal, this little detail was the one that shaped my imagination of the situation the most and made it so utterly atmospheric in the first place. Second, I think that the musical score doesn't fit the atmosphere and the plot at all. I mean, you have a classic film noir about a man who uncovers more than he is supposed to and is gradually more entangled in a web of criminality, corruption and immorality. This cheerful, buoyantly performed guitar melody makes it appear less threatening, dangerous and alarming than it in fact is. Like, the man knows too much, he knows that knowing too much will get you killed and he constantly roams the ruins of a once glorious city that is now defined by misery, melancholy and depression - a serene guitar tune is utterly out of place. It should have been ominous orchestral music that reflects the emotions of everyone involved more precisely. However, despite those two minimal flaws, the film shines in all other matters. The transition of a pulp novelist who comes to visit his old friend only to find out that he is dead to an amateur investigator who unravels that his buddy is still alive and one of the worst racketeers of the city is done marvellously. All the details that gradually add to the picture are ingeniously and equally given away, and the suspense is build up superbly. Oh, and this historical accuracy! Just like Quentin Tarantino would do sixty years later, director Reed casted Germanophone actors and actresses for the roles that are supposed to speak the language, and this adds a lot to the realism, since I am German myself and can tell that every line of German dialogue was indeed correct. Furthermore, I like how they managed to make the devastated streets of Vienna a crucial factor that contributed to the threatening atmosphere of the film. Oh, and that cast is delivering brilliantly as well. Cotton as the writer gone detective, Italian dame Alida Valli as the beloved and Trevor Howard as Maj. Callaghan ... pardon me ... Calloway are delivering fine performances, but despite his little screen time, Orson Welles steals the show as the presumed dead racketeer. From the first scene his face is illuminated in the dark over the conversation on the Ferris wheel to the final pursuit in the sewers, he dominates every single scene he is in with his sheer presence.

406,11 January 2000,frankfan,8, Not wholly perfect...,"I just finished watching the ""Criterion Collection"" DVD of The Third Man, which is a glorious remastered print containing a multitude of extras. This was the first time I had ever seen the Third Man and I can honestly say that I have many conflicting feelings about it.  For its cinematic accomplishments, I have to give it an 8/10. Its beautifully haunting scenes of post-war Vienna still remain clear in my mind. It truly does not seem like a film from 1949 in this aspect.  However, it is considered to be the greatest ""suspense thriller"" of its kind, and it is this aspect that I highly disagree with.  I never felt a sense of suspense or impending danger throughout the movie, and as far as suspense is concerned, it is no match for any of the great Hitchcock gems, or say the Manchurian Candidate.  If you are expecting a suspensful thriller, I doubt you will find it here. In my humble opinion, a major reason for the lack of suspense, is the use of the ever present sounds of that damned zither. While it is an interesting choice of instruments to use, I don't feel that it is appropriate or effective. I found it to be hugely annoying and if there was a way to mute it I would have. It did not supplement the mood or action of the story in any way and constantly seemed to be out of place. A major disappointment here. Thank God they chose to leave it out during the final sewer chase, as it would have destroyed this wonderful scene. There are movies that I give 8-10/10 that I absolutely loved and fully enjoyed, and then there are others that I have to give high marks because they are great films, but I did not wholly enjoy. This is the case with The Third Man.  Cinematically, it is perfect.  However, I don't feel that the whole package was so.  I would welcome any or all comments regarding this movie and would love to hear others feelings regarding the zither!!!",

All these fit into the noir equation, and it works perfectly. The cast provides memorable roles, but none are more memorable than Orson Welles' character. He doesn't show up until 2/3 of the movie is finished, but he gives his second-best performance of all time(Kane being No. 1). The story gives suprising twists in it to keep the viewer interested, but it's the photography and direction that are the stars here. The tilted angles and the rush of the sewer chase climax stand out in the film, and the cinematography is constantly brooding and mysterious, even in the daytime.

""The Third Man"" was one of the last English speaking pictures that were of any major significance abroad for some 20 years. European Cinema, revitalized after the war, would always be intellectually superior, breaking new artistic ground until America's awful Production Code was finally lifted in 1967.

It is, in my opinion, an almost perfect film and in my reckoning I cannot give higher praise than that for anything. Call me a cynic, but nothing is perfect. Perfection is something to strive for. As I watched it I realised several things. One of them was how perfect, sorry, almost perfect, the casting was for the characters. I cannot imagine any other person to take the part of Holly Martins than Joseph Cotton. Nor can I contemplate Harry Lime to be no one else except Orson Welles. Trevor Howard is wonderful and Bernard Lee is marvellous. But then again is it because I've watched it so many times that it's now a case that Holly Martins is Joseph Cotton and Harry Lime is Orson Welles and so on? Another thing was, and here I am slightly prejudiced as I like B/W photography, is what if this film had been made in colour? How ghastly a thought is that? None of the slippery bleakness of the city, none of the suspicious shadows and none of the bleakness of the night. And the final thing was that I cannot remember a better character introduction into film than Harry Lime. A cat purring around a pair a shiny black shoes of a man in a very dark doorway - suddenly a light switched on from a room in the apartment opposite spills across the road into the doorway and there stands Orson Welles.

Then there are some films that are praised as classics simply because the style or subject matter was relevant at when it was made. The third man was recently rated the greatest British film ever made (and one of the top ten best films ever made in the world). While I normally love seeing classic movies, after seeing The third man I felt a nagging sense of disappointment. The cinematography, acting, lighting and music are all brilliant, but we have seen better examples throughout the years. The movie has an original plot when all is revealed, but the first half of the film is simply a traditional mystery story. The final hide-and-seek chase in the end is truly well done, but it's effectiveness is undermined by the fact that Lime is at this stage depicted as a truly unsympathetic character. He is too evil for us to have sympathy with him, and he is too scared to be a frightening villain in the scene. I felt some sense of ""What's the point"" throughout the story. there is a nice story about ethics and duty, but the entire development happens in the last fifteen minutes, and seems rushed. Ultimately therefore, I found the film good, but dated and not timeless as there were few elements in this film that haven't been utilized to greater effect before and since. 8/10",

Also, while Welles' brief performance is probably the finest of his career, Cotten's acting is rather flat and uninspired, making his character more one-dimensional than is really necessary. The cinematography is inspired, truly some of the finest to be found anywhere, but the editing is rather choppy. The movie deserves to be on the AFI 100 list for its contribution to cinematic history, as it is really the forerunner of the entire film noir genre, but on its sheer artistic merits it does not quite rank with Fantasia, Network, The Manchurian Candidate, and a number of other films AFI placed farther down on the list.

431,14 March 2013,reddevil_42,8, Finding the third man,"I liked the Third Man but I do not feel that this was Josef Cotten's best performance, as many have quoted it to be. On the other hand, I felt that Orson Welles as Harry Lime and Trevor Howard as Major Calloway were brilliant. The first half of the movie though felt slightly flat. The whole cover up act performed by Lime's aides would any day arouse enough suspicion. The exaggerated emotions, meant to draw a stark contrast between Holly's innocence and his wily opponents, come off as artificial at times. Holly's attempts to woo Anna felt insincere considering his friend had presumably just died. It was only when things started to get out of control that the movie really picks up. In steps Orson Welles and one of the best second halves a movie could have. Orson Welles' performance is refreshing and the scene at the top of ferris wheel is truly captivating containing one of the most iconic movie quotes. Welles feels ever so comfortable portraying Lime and every bit of his role comes off as genuine. One is very well inclined to be deluded into believing that there was nothing ethically wrong with his character but both the viewer and Cotten's character are then served a reality check by Major Calloway in the Hospital scene. Anna's unwavering loyalty to Lime leaves the viewer baffled at times yet we not go deep into Anna and Lime's past leaving that part of the story in the dark. I rate the final scene of the movie as one of my favourites next to those of City Lights and Manhattan. Overall, I felt the movie slightly overrated at first viewing but opinions do change with time and hopefully I'll be able to see what the most qualified critics have been able to.",

Lime is played brilliantly by Orson Welles in one of the most memorable performances in screen history, even though he has a short role and does not have much screen time his presence is felt throughout the entire film. Upon his arrival Holly discovers that Harry has been killed in a traffic accident and he just makes it to the funeral where he meets Major Calloway, played superbly by Trevor Howard, who tells Holly that Harry was a thief and a murderer; at first Holly is outraged and does not believe it, but then he decides to investigate, and gradually discovers that it's all true. Harry has staged his own death and is very much alive. The final climatic confrontation between Holly and Harry in the sewers of Vienna is truly one for the ages.

The third man was made in 1949, but the acting seems to have grown out of the stage-like style found in as late as the 1960s. The performance of note is Harry Lime's, whose half mysterious half self-confident smile on his first appearance impressed me the most.
The previously mentioned scene and its leading up are also the best in the movie. The name Harry Lime has been mentioned for almost half the movie, drawing much curiosity from the audience. However, we don't even get to see his face despite he is virtually all that is discussed. Therefore, when the anonymous man in the dark corner is introduced, we get excited at the thought that the man is Harry. Yes, it is all predictable, but the revelation here, with Harry's smile and the urging guitar tune, feels so satisfying.

Was the third man Lime himself or was it the murdered orderly?

It doesn't meet the expectations that many have for a movie. While I side with those that think the movie is great, I think many of the people who loved it praised it for the wrong reasons. This is not a movie with a ""gripping"" plot or characters you will remember for the rest of your life (and yes the zither music would seem out of place if you're seeking pathos). But to criticize the movie for those reasons (as many reviewers did) seems like criticizing ""Ulysses"" for being a little slow-going. Everything in the movie is DESIGNED to create the utmost emotional detachment for the viewer. Examples include the zither music, the dispassionate and unsympathetic characters, the lack of concern demonstrated by the protagonist concerning his danger (denying the viewer real suspense), the absence of ""preaching"" about the horrors of post-War Europe, the refusal to show the film's climax, and shots that make you want to look at the architecture rather than the people. Thus, despite the fact that film's story is depressing in the extreme, the persistent mood of the film is a satisfying mixture of melancholy, amusement, and cheerfulness. The effect, made possible by its detachment, provides a proper emotional seeting to contemplate the aesthetics of the movie's superb cinemeotraphy. In conclusion, if you're looking for thrills or even deep thoughts, don't watch this movie. But if you want a cheerfully detached work of art, this is the movie for you.",

442,30 May 2022,oppaimauspad,7, Orson Welles Monologue,The Third Man is an extremely overrated film. The only reason critics and curators like it is because Orson Wells gives a monologue about how he views people as ants and wouldn't mind squashing a few of them.,
443,29 November 1999,artsconsult,9," An expressionist view of post-war Vienna, The Third Man is one of the most artfully crafted films I've seen.","Strong cinematography and direction yield this amazing study of light and darkness. Although the Third Man's plot is vintage post-war noir, and compelling, the sequence of spaces captured by Reed are the most noteworthy aspect of the film. Each street scene is worthy of an exhibit.",
444,13 August 2003,panzerbushjr,10, Mystery in Post War Europe,"Just about my favorite black and white movie. And a fine mystery at that. Cotton, Wells, Valli and the rest of the cast all fit their roles. Hyde-White as Crabbin injects that bit of surprise into the movie. Valli gives you that hopeless feeling that many people felt after the war. I cant think of anyone else that could have done the roles better. The chase scenes are legend. You just cant find movies like this anymore.",

It was mature and surprisingly dark for a film of the forties. In fact, I can't think of another film from this era that is as downbeat. I'm no expert, mind you, but The Third Man easily sets itself apart from the crowd.",
446,31 May 2014,Visitor_C,10, An Old Classic Noir,"I can find no negatives to throw at this classic film. The acting is amazing, the story is interesting, and the development deep. If I had to pick something out of this that would be considered a negative, it would have to be the plot. At times, the plot is slow and lazy, taking away from the story being told. Other then that, the film feels spotless. Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten bring excellent performances to the film, leading it towards a fulfilling conclusion. This is worth a purchase in all forms, and especially plenty of re-watches. Of course this is just my personal opinion, but it is a very sincere explanation of the long list of positives this film dishes out.",
447,31 July 2017,Brian-9229,10, What Criterion edition?!,"The Third Man has received a 4K remaster recently, and was released by Studio Canal, in France, Germany, and in the UK. The results are most excellent! Contrast has been greatly improved, as well as shadow detail. This new print is gorgeously dark, as was the artistic intent. Grain also appears well intact and quite even. All the issues that the prior Studio Canal release had, have been eliminated, namely the annoying flickering. This print appears to be free of any damage, scratches, etc. I personally, cannot stress enough how beautiful this print is. The blacks are just perfect! Having only listened to the English DTS-HD master audio.2.0, I can say it sounds excellent! Clarity is front and center, and I did not hear any hissing, or other related age issues, typically found in a film of this age. And, the Harry Lime Theme, played on the Zither, has never sounded better. All in all, this is a truly wonderful release. The digibook(France release) was a nice touch as well, with somewhat better artwork than most releases of this film have seen. I personally also greatly appreciated the excellent array of special features. Mostly, the restoration featurette. Which provided some fascinating insight into the restoration process. Short of a new 4K UHD release, I'll never need another copy of this masterpiece!",

Very different. Does anyone know what music was used? I am a tango dancer and found the strains of the violin very reminiscent of some of the music we dance to. I know there is a main theme that is repeated quite frequently throughout the movie. Unfortunately, I don't recognize it and was hoping someone else might. It would be wonderful if someone knew the the performers as well as the composition. I wonder if this information would be available in the jumbo, super sized version of membership.

From the Harry's porter he comes to know that there was a ""third man"", who was he? is the question Holly seeks in the movie. Later on some events unfolds in such a way forcing Holly to change his mind toward Harry. The movie is set up during the post war period, opening shots shows Vienna which has been destructed by the war. The most amazing thing about the movie is the camera work and the editing. The movie is of 1949, and by this it can be said that during that point of time people would have loved it, as the plot is so intriguing that you cannot leave your seat for once.

While the character he plays is dead from the beginning of the story we find our selves wanting to see more. The cinematography seems so real showing us scenes of a post war Vienna. The plot excellently played out never revealing to much leaving the viewer to want to see and learn more. To the very end this film keeps you on your heels,
457,4 October 2006,park1ns0n,2, Hyper-overrated! This is one of the worst films I've ever seen!,"I really do wonder if the people that rate and comment on this movie have ever seen any noir movie or anything else other than Arnold Schwarzenegger productions. How can one even compare Welles' own ""A Touch Of Evil"", a masterpiece in the true sense of the word, with this pile of bad writing, bad filming, bad acting, bad ideas, bad directing; in other words... pile of crap! Are you the people that highly under-rate Tarkovski's ""Stalker"" for example so that is has 8.0 avg, which is less than this unspeakable blasphemy of a movie. This doesn't even make justice for normal films-noir, again overrated, like ""Double Indemnity"" or ""The Maltese Falcon"". At least TMF has some nice characters. Here nobody inspires anything. It seems that all the people in this movie are idiots. Example: Our hero , Holly Martins, has the idea that Harry Lime is alive because, when our hero was as drunk as Bush in a summer day, he thought he'd seen his supposed dead friend in the city at night. Who in God's name would believe him. Seems the police does... Did those scriptwriters not know that also intelligent human beings, not only Marilyn Monroe fans would watch this movie. Carol Reed is a bad director. This movie actually started to hurt after about an hour. Manos The Hands Of Fate is better. Also, I understand that Orson Welles need the money, but this not a commercial film, this is not even a film.Period.",
458,13 December 2014,ClairePusatere,7, Didn't live up to expectations,"Many people have recommended this movie very highly to me, and maybe I went in expecting too much. Don't get me wrong, this movie is the very definition of a noir, but that's also where it fails. I've tried to watch The Third Man from start to finish twice, and both times I ended up falling asleep and having to finish after my unexpected nap. For a crime movie, it isn't very exciting, and if you miss one or two bits of conversation the whole rest of the film will be confusing. Maybe noir just really isn't my thing, because I appreciated the lighting style and general cinematography, but I just couldn't seem to stay interested in the plot.",

463,20 June 2022,ismaelslgd,10, An all time favorite classic noir,"It is impossible for me to decide on what my favorite movie ever is, but Carol Reed's 1949 masterpiece The Third Man is certainly in the conversation. Set in post-World War II Vienna, the film is inherently lathered with dark, deflating themes of exploitation, corruption and unrequited love. This ambience is brilliantly enhanced by its minimalistic score, which is played on a zither and echoes through the empty, rainy streets of what was once the mecca of the classical music world. A great story that begins as a mystery and then becomes something much more dire, The Third Man is immortalized by its unforgettable look. I stick to my opinion that the visuals could not work any other way, and that adding color would be more detrimental to this film than it would be to any other noir I have seen. The shadows, shapes and depth, particularly the scene in sewers, make everything that resembles it seem like a cheap imitation. Make sure you watch director Carol Reed's cut of the film, as it is the version that I would call a noir in the truest of senses.",
464,31 January 2021,mdtyner,8, I hate zither music!,"I had higher expectations for this film. It was highly rated, had a star cast, and an intreaging plot line. And the last third of the movie delivered.
But the start of the movie was slow and disjointed. Cotton's character was forced, unnatural and contrived. And the female lead was too uninvolved and impossible for the story. She was too caring, then she cared nothing at all, then too caring again. She never had my sympathy. And Cotton came off as a fool.
I'm not sure why many characters existed. The witnesses to the death of Lemon were undeveloped and creepy. The killing of the old man was unwarranted. The accusation by the little boy was phony and unnecessary.
It was only after Wells' character shows up at the end of the film that the movie comes together. He gives the film some meaning and intellect and raises up the other characters. The conflict finally makes sense, and the action is now finally developed. It's like a different writer and director took over.
So the film was salvaged at the end. But the first part was rough. And the damned soundtrack of that awful zither made the film painful to sit through!",

Personally, I liked Graham Greene's book very much, but when I saw this film I felt it was not at the level of the original story. Right from the start (we got a Rollo Martins who suddenly becomes Holly Martins, and so on), the characters, circumnstances, and general atmosphere are very different in the two versions. I would not ask for an exact copy, of course; adaptation for the big screen is not that. But I would have been pleased to see a GOOD adaptation.

469,25 February 2018,maxtbuettner,8, Beautifully shot and directed,"The Third Man is filled with great writing, acting, and directing, but the greatest aspect of the movie is the cinematography. Carol Reed and cinematographer Robert Krasker did a fantastic job of depicting a post world war II Vienna. The deep shadows and large amount of dutch angles add to the mystery, uneasiness, and tension of the plot.
 Most film noir are filled with hard-boiled detectives and pessimistic tones. Reed replaces the detective with a writer trying to find out the truth about his friend's death. Most noir are filled with deep, slow jazz, but The Third Man's soundtrack is filled with upbeat guitar music. It seems out of place when it first plays but it only adds to the weird conspiracy of Orson Welles' death. While The Third Man is considered film noir I believe it stands out form the rest.",

I don't like the movie very much because of Orsene Welles' arrogant, arrogant, and despicable personality, because for example, during his participation in the movie Black Rose in 1950, and he was filming in Morocco, and Morocco was then under the French mandate. Detainees from the Moroccan revolution, and he added it to the scene, and Orsene Welles agreed, and replaced the dolls with real people who died of death, so that this film would be the only film of pictures of execution of real people, and the shot was later deleted from the film
A person who presents art is supposed to have morals and a human conscience, but he is Orsene Welles far from this matter, and there are many other incidents, but with all my hatred towards him, I cannot deny his distinguished works, his cinematic success, and the presentation of a historical film such as.

Every frame is reminiscent of the best old black-and-white noirs, especially the film's final shot; the men look better in fedora hats and cigarettes. The plot, which is sometimes hard to follow, is well-crafted, full of unexpected twists and turns, and it's a shame that Orson Welles' fantastic acting is so short; the movie comes alive when it's on screen.
