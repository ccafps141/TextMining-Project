Whether we like the film, or not, one has to recognize the greatest achievement, perhaps, of the creative talent of the people working in the movie industry. ""Gone with the Wind"" represents a monumental leap, as well as a departure, for the movies, as they were done prior to this film.",/
1,21 October 2006,bkoganbing,10, Scarlett's So High Spirited And Vivacious,"Before I ever saw Gone With the Wind, I was well acquainted with Max Steiner's theme. It opened WOR TV's Million Dollar Movie before every broadcast in New York in the Fifties and Sixties. When my parents took me to see Gone With the Wind in one of MGM's re-releases as the film music started in my youthful eagerness to show off my knowledge I remarked to all who could hear that that was stolen from Million Dollar Movie.",r
2,5 August 2006,planktonrules,10, About as good as it gets in 1930s Hollywood,"I've done so many reviews on IMDb and despite this, I can't believe I never reviewed this super-famous film. Well, much if this is because with so many reviews, I truly doubt if anyone will ever read this! I was surprised that when I perused the reviews, there were quite a few knuckleheads that gave the film a score of one!! While I do agree that the film is rather dated in the way it deals with minorities, it is truly insane to trash a film just because it offends your easily damaged sensibilities. One person even compared the film to PLAN 9! Come on, folks,...this is an amazing film. And what makes it even more amazing is that the film had several different directors because producer Selznick was so difficult to work with on this film! And, despite this, the film wins (among many other awards), the BEST DIRECTOR Oscar! While I do think that many Oscars should have been earned, giving it to just one man seemed pretty cheeky! Despite this, this is a magnificent sweeping spectacle about the South--but even more about a selfish beauty who ultimately creates chaos of her decent life. Magnificent, well-acted and memorable--this is one of the greatest films of all time.",e
3,12 June 2020,Turanic,10, The tragedy of Scarlet the wise 2020 review,"At first you would think, the main theme of the film is the horrors of war and the idea that both sides suffer , but that is not the only case in ""Gone with the Wind"", the war is just a background...
Scarlet lives almost her entire life in an illusion of love... She has a target she want to achieve and she thinks if she achieves it she will be happy, while missing the point on the way to that target... Something that I realised on a 2nd viewing is that Scarlet is a pretty selfish person with sociopaths behaviour. She can easily manipulate men and sometimes women in order to achieve her goal. She can kill a person and not feel that bad about it,she can exploit prisoners rather than hire free men. The goal is what pushes her forward and sometimes makes her do good things, but these deeds are never done out of big heart, they are usually done in self interest. You would think she ends up achieving everything she wanted, but she does not. Scarlet lives in a personal hell which partially she created herself and only when the last obstacle to her big love, the female friend that loves her is gone, she realises that all this time, she lived the illusion of love, she was hurting the people that loved her. Is scarlet a horrible person? Probably... Does she pay for her sins? She does more than anyone... Does she understand what true love is? Yes in the end she does... What makes this film so great, it's a tragedy like ""War And Peace"" with monumental character development ...Any scenes of war and racism fade compared to the tragedy of Scarlet which lives in personal hell...",v
4,29 September 2020,Xstal,9, A Tempestuous Hurricane of a Tornado...,"When a film is consistently recognised through the wisdom of the crowd, over so many years, as being great and epic and, for the duration of that film to run close to four hours - it really does suggest something a bit special. That something a bit special is a timeless story set during some of the darkest times in American history but it isn't the setting that makes this special, it's the story, the story of a cruel, selfish and manipulative opportunist performing her craft to perfection, it's the story portrayed through one of the greatest cinematic performances the world of movies has ever seen. While the leading man and the supporting cast are outstanding, you walk away from this with only one person holding and controlling your thoughts, just like the character she plays, just as she does through the whole of the picture - the incredible and sublimely talented, the beautiful and vivacious, the tempestuous hurricane of a tornado that is Vivien Leigh. Setting the bar so high it remains unparalleled, even to this day.",i
5,8 July 2011,murtaza_mma,10," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: An American magnum opus which must be watched and often, and by those who understand cinema","Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind, in its true essence, is a case study on the Old American way of living where pride and honor were the very essence of human existence. Victor Fleming's rendition of the classic novel, a classic within its own right, does full justice to the themes propagated by Mitchell's evocative masterpiece. In the words of Mitchell herself, Gone with the Wind is the story of the people whose gift of gumption gave them a definitive edge to endure the tribulation and throes of the American Civil War vis-à-vis those who lacked an inner resolve and determination needed for survival.",e
6,30 March 2022,PCC0921,9," Margaret Mitchell won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel on May 3rd, 1937","The year 1939 was a busy year for the Hollywood industry. Large-scale, majestic epics were front and center that year. You should look up the list of films released in 1939. It was a very, busy year, with huge titles from the golden age. Lots and lots of entertainment for a pre-WW2 audience. The Wizard of Oz (1939), Stagecoach (1939), Son of Frankenstein (1939), Drums Along the Mohawk (1939) and this little film, are just some of the titles on that list. Everyone was competing for perfection in the film industry. The first two hurtles, being sound and color film, had been implemented into the technical side of the filmmaking process, to this point in film history. Technicolor had been utilized for, about, five years to this point and it was perfectly utilized in this film too. Technicolor always was a good film stock, rich with colors, that pop on the screen. Head cinematographer, Ernest Haller's camera, captures images, not seen before on film and blazes colors across the screen, in Gone With the Wind (1939).",w
7,19 March 2012,ElMaruecan82,10, A universal masterpiece and one of the few privileged films where every scene is a classic on its own ...,"For some nostalgic dreamers, ""Gone With the Wind"" is a glorious swan song depicting the fall of the South during a devastating Civil War, and its reconstruction on the ashes of the Old Order, a Civilization forever ""gone with the wind"". It's the adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's epic tale written in bold letters with this peculiar ability to portray the Yankees as the 'bad guys', so common in the stories related by Southerners, as they invite us to understand their idealism if not to root for it: a vision of Gallantry and Old European Nobility where women were courted, wives were submissive to their husbands and slaves treated with paternalism.",/

11,12 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10," A sweeping epic film, that in my eyes is outstanding!","Gone With the Wind is a truly remarkable epic film. True, it is four hours long, but there are several redeeming qualities that make it an unforgettable movie experience. The cinematography is gorgeous, with a wonderful contrast of beauty (love) and ugliness (war), though the war scenes could have been a tad more developed, if that is a minor offering of a criticism. The costumes are lovely, especially Scarlett O'Hara's dresses, and the music score is phenomenal, with a sweeping unforgettable title theme, that possibly everyone in the world knows. The performances were astonishing. The beautiful Vivien Leigh gives a tour de force performance as Scarlett, a performance of vulnerability, sadness and beauty. Who can't forget her passionate outbursts ""Great Balls of Fire""? Butterfly McQueen is hilarious as Prissy, with lines such as ""I don't know nothing about birthing babies"". But topping them all, in a natural if somewhat unlikeable performance as Rhett Butler, is the wonderful underrated Clark Gable, with his iconic remarks (""Frankly my dear I don't give a damn""), hearty laugh and sneer. This film was ignored for a long time, and is now considered one of the most remarkable films ever made. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",1

It tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, played the very beautiful Vivien Leigh. She is one of the most selfish heroines you will ever see in a movie and still care for her. She is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) but he marries to Melanie Hamilton. She is played by Olivia de Havilland in a great performance. A new man in Scarlett's life is Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) but Scarlett does everything to get what she wants including marrying someone for money and her own benefit.

Gone With The Wind lives up to it's powerful reputation,"I waited 28 year before even considering watching Gone With The Wind. Four plus hours long? 1939? It was as old as my Dad. But finally in a desire to see all these classic movies I sat down to watch it...since then and before writing this review I have now seen it three times. Gone With The Wind is quite simply breath taking. It is brilliant and captivating and perhaps one of the greatest epics you will ever lay eyes on. Some people consider Gone With The Wind to be the greatest film ever made and it's pretty easy to see why. Especially if you factor in the time period this was made the 'special effects' the sheer grandeur of it is impressive NOW let alone 65 years ago. The raging war, the fields being worked, the attacks being carried out, the people evacuating, and the beauty and horror of the south during the civil war. Add onto that this incredible unmatched chemistry between the romantic leads and you've got one incredible epic that defined epic before it even existed.",=

26,27 July 2021,nickenchuggets,10," ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn""","What can I say about this now legendary movie that hasn't been stated numerous times already? When adjusted for monetary inflation, Gone With the Wind is still the most profitable movie ever made 80 years after its debut. Even audiences a day after its release were in love with this movie, due to the superb acting, casting, civil war setting, and of course, all of it made even more impressive by the use of Technicolor. Believe it or not, this was the first color movie to win an Oscar, which may surprise many people. The question that remains in many minds is whether or not the film is still worth looking at almost a century later, and the answer is yes. 1939 may have not been a very good time for Europe because of what was about to begin later that year, but many film critics cite this year as being one of Hollywood's best. So many classic movies were released in just this one year, including things like Wizard of Oz, Ninotchka, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, The Women, and this one. One of the primary reasons why Gone With the Wind still holds its magic after all these decades is because the story itself is timeless. Hundreds of years ago, love stories were as prominent as they are now, and I'm sure they'll be around in the coming centuries as well. Because the plot of the movie is centered around this type of narrative, it will never go out of style. Add on to this big name actors playing the parts, such as Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland, and you are given a recipe for perfection. Despite it being a romance story at its core, Gone With the Wind is much more complicated than just that. The story starts (much like the novel) on the eve of the american civil war. It is the year 1861, and the gorgeous Scarlett O'Hara is living in sunny and humid Georgia with her parents, who happen to be slaveowners. Being Irish, she is pondering the idea of marrying someone who resembles someone from her ancestral homeland. To this end, she decides to approach Ashley Wilkes, but he rejects her, planning to enter an incestuous relationship with his cousin Melanie (de Havilland) instead. Shortly after, Scarlett meets a tall and suitable love interest in the form of Rhett Butler (Gable), but they are rudely interupted when news arrives telling everyone that the Confederate military has attacked the Union held Fort Sumter, beginning the civil war. This event (predictably) turns everyone's lives upside down, and a man who Scarlett later marries (who isn't Rhett) is killed in the war. Meanwhile, the conflict is going badly for the Confederacy, and their luck runs out at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. Scarlett manages to run away back to her hometown of Tara, only to learn her mother is dead from typhoid and her father is delirious. Once the war is over, Scarlett's father tries to ride after a troublemaker on his horse, but falls off of it and dies. The movie then attempts to connect this part with the beginning by bringing back Ashley, but he still doesn't want to be with Scarlett. Rhett eventually marries her instead, and they have a daughter whom they name Bonnie Blue (after the nickname of the first flag given to the confederacy). Despite this accomplishment, Scarlett doesn't seem to like Rhett anymore because he finds out she only wants Ashley. After getting in a verbal fight with him, Scarlett falls and suffers a miscarriage. It gets even worse when her daughter tries to jump a fence while riding a small horse (just like Scarlett's father) and the impact ends up killing her. Annoyingly, after all the abuse she's been through, Scarlett changes her mind again and tells Rhett she wants to be with him as he's getting ready to leave her life forever. He says his famous line, and Scarlett promises to regain his affection someday as the film ends. The first time watching this, I really didn't expect an ending so abrupt. Personally, I think it could have gone on much longer, especially considering how Melanie is dying towards the end of the movie because of the stress pregnancy put on her. In any case, Gone With the Wind is already almost 4 hours in length and that is all most audiences will be able to watch in one sitting. I saw this movie last year for the first time and was not the same afterwards. It really is incredible how they managed to do all this in the 30s with no access to computers or anything like that. Only the most determined people can assemble something of this magnitude. Yes, it helps that the entire layout for the story was already on display for all to see in a novel, but adapting all of it for the big screen must have been a huge challenge. It's a good thing they decided to use color for this movie because you wouldn't get the full effect of the civil war setting otherwise. It is mostly remembered as a war that happened in black and white, but that's not the reality. By watching this film, we can see it as people in the 1860s saw it, in all its horrors. The burning city of Atlanta, the vibrant colors of the plantations, and the beautiful countryside of Georgia are all brought to life here. Unsurprisingly, the casting is also excellent. Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara, the main character, but overshadowed by Rhett in many ways. She is, in a way, foolish, and changes her mind way too often about who she is romantically interested in. This indecisiveness ultimately leads to the one person she truly loved disappearing from her life forever. Clark Gable as Rhett Butler may seem like a fairly stable, moderate guy since he is shown to love Scarlett and even ends up marrying her, but the longer their marriage goes on, the more strained it becomes. By the finale, his patience is exhausted, and feels no pity for Scarlett when she tells him she'll never find someone like him again. Olivia de Havilland plays Melanie, Ashley's cousin (and love interest). She's not featured as prominently as Scarlett, but her character still has an important part in the story. She's the main reason stopping Ashley from being with Scarlett. The music in the film consists of many songs written during the civil war, such as Dixie and Bonnie Blue Flag, and you might notice they're all southern songs because that's where it takes place. There's also the theme for the town of Tara which has become rather iconic, and is usually the unofficial theme song of this movie. Anyone with a brain can deduce that Gone With the Wind was also insanely popular when it came to awards as well. In 1940, it set a record for Oscar wins and nominations, won 8, and was nominated for 13. This record stood all the way until 1958 when Gigi won 9 oscars, and Ben Hur the following year won 11. This enormous mountain of praise is but one of the reasons why people should watch this movie, even 80 years after its release. It is one of very few films that is basically flawless and strong in all categories. The casting is great, the acting is great, the music is memorable and exciting, and the story is as timeless as the universe itself. It really is among the best movies ever made, if not the best.",_
27,20 November 2017,paskuniag-584-890551,9, Like the film? Read the book.,"I've seen the film many times, have always enjoyed it. But I've been reading the book for the first time. It's a very long novel, and you have to stay with it if you want to see the ending. It's a good read, but Margaret Mitchell, former newspaper reporter, is very thorough in her description of both Southern culture and the changes that the Civil War brought to it. It's the size of the book that was the biggest challenge for David O Selznick. Not what parts to film, but which parts to leave out. So many characters that appeared in the book couldn't be introduced in the movie without extending the film's length to well over four hours. So he had Sidney Howard write the screenplay, then cut that down to a filmable length by hiring several more writers to further pare the script, and was still rewriting it himself while it was being filmed. Selznick was close to running out of money, so he asked his angel, millionaire Jock Whitney, to loan him enough to finish the film. The film was finally completed and edited, then was test-marketed at a theatre not far from LA. The viewers were excited about having seen it and said so on their preview cards, which allowed Selznick to rest easy, knowing he had a hit on his hands.",u

Made at the height of Selznick's professional and creative powers, after he had gone independent from RKO and before his obsessive tinkering and control over the people he hired became a detriment, Gone with the Wind was Selznick's biggest, brashest attempt to entertain the masses, hooking onto a popular book and throwing every cinematic tool he had at it until it became the biggest movie of all time.",

37,21 July 2006,vitaleralphlouis,10, All Time Best Movie Heads South,"For decades this picture remained #1 on virtually all lists of the best picture ever made as well as the all time box office champion. Suddenly though, the film's reputation heads South. I won't elaborate on the excellence or entertainment value because whatever I say you already know. GWTW was bounced off the box office list primarily because movie prices are never adjusted to constant dollars, thus the newest pictures always win. When GWTW opened in 1939, the admission price of $1.15 was so severe that some theaters had picket lines of protest. In 1939 a good middle class annual income was $800, so $1.15 was indeed expensive. Compare that to today's $10.50 and you see who wins. As to the film's reputation for excellence, this has been trashed in recent years because (1) the film portrays slaves during the Civil War era --- and this is shocking to the political correctness crowd; (2) the slaves act like slaves rather than acting like Snoop Dogg, Ice T, or even Sidney Poitier; another outrage to liberal censorship. The wacky left American Film Institute has thus dropped America's All Time Great Movie from #1 to it's current standing in the trash heap. Thinking people, however, still appreciate and love this classic. For the record, this picture was intensely popular with Black people when released in 1939, again in 1941, in 1954, in 1961 et cetera.",

42,6 April 2022,GusherPop,10," Amazing Film every generation needs to see it, Can't be remade","""Gone With the Wind"" presents a sentimental view of the Civil War, in which the ""Old South"" takes the place of Camelot and the war was fought not so much to defeat the Confederacy and free the slaves as to give Miss Scarlett O'Hara her comeuppance. But we've known that for years; the tainted nostalgia comes with the territory. Yet as ""GWTW"" approaches its 60th anniversary, it is still a towering landmark of film, quite simply because it tells a good story, and tells it wonderfully well. For the story it wanted to tell, it was the right film at the right time. Scarlett O'Hara is not a creature of the 1860s but of the 1930s: a free-spirited, willful modern woman. The way was prepared for her by the flappers of Fitzgerald's jazz age, by the bold movie actresses of the period, and by the economic reality of the Depression, which for the first time put lots of women to work outside their homes. And there is a joyous flamboyance in the visual style that is appealing in these days when so many directors have trained on the blandness of television. Consider an early shot where Scarlett and her father look out over the land, and the camera pulls back, the two figures and a tree held in black silhouette with the landscape behind them. Or the way the flames of Atlanta are framed to backdrop Scarlett's flight in the carriage. Some of the individual shots in ""GWTW"" still have the power to leave us breathless, including the burning of Atlanta, the flight to Tara and the ""street of dying men"" shot, as Scarlett wanders into the street and the camera pulls back until the whole Confederacy seems to lie broken and bleeding as far as the eye can see.",

Considering the thirties this movie is something most original in the history of cinema. Institution. The true magic of life. Of course, the term ""magic"" I think everything that lives in a certain time pass. I'm a little disappointed because I think it is in the final hour of an epic spectacle given the characteristics of the classic soap opera. This movie is full of freshness and strange irony. The irony of the film no one escaped, at least a ""gentleman"" in the American South. The horrors of war are quite credible. The arrogance and pomposity ""Southerners"" are completely the opposite of the characteristics of the main characters.",
44,23 November 2010,mjneu59,10, Golden Age Hollywood at its zenith,"What may be the most famous movie of all time is also one of the more purely entertaining epics ever made, although part of its astonishing longevity is because the film is much more than just another antebellum potboiler. Perhaps the secret to its success can be found in the central quartet of characters: petulant, headstrong Scarlett O'Hara; charming rogue Rhett Butler; and the less colorful but equally complex Ashley Wilkes and Melanie, completing a tangled romantic foursome thrown together and cast apart by chance, destiny, and the fortunes of war. But in the end the film belongs to Scarlett, and her rocky path to maturity, from her old plantation home through the siege of Atlanta to rags and later riches after the Civil War, makes the mammoth four-hour long production pass all too quickly. It's easy to see what made Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel such a hot property at the time: Hollywood in the 1930s shared with the Old South similar ideals of wealth and privilege (and, in the studios, a similar plan of institutionalized slavery), and the film matches the grandeur of its subject by oozing pomp and prestige from every lavish Technicolor frame.",

At any rate, if you have any interest in this film, I highly recommend the documentary ""The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind"", directed by David Hinton in 1988. It offers a unique glimpse of how a movie is made, not just any movie but an exceptional movie.
I am now writing a separate review of that documentary, which mercifully only runs for about half of the running time of the movie itself.

This film is NOT about race, but about a period of TIME, a portrayal of the lifestyle of the South at that time. Rhett is a Profiteer, Scarlet a hopeless spoiled romantic, the upper crust despising a ""slave auction"" of white women to raise $ for ""The Cause"". And Hattie McDonald... the portrayal of a Loving, caring, nurturing outspoken mammy. (Which is a Derivative if MOMMY). This movie need be watched as an example of a Moment in time. Of an impolite society doing its best to be ""polite"" under false pretense. It HAS HISTORICAL VALUE. The costumes, the settings, the burning of Atlanta.
Margaret Mitchell had it right, this is an Epic story with which each subsequent viewing enlightens one on the understandings of human nature and self-determination. Hattie Mc Daniel is the best, Butterfly McQueen May have portrayed a stereotype... however we MUST view this story as an epic almost mythological tale of the beginnings of Civil Rights.",

One of the most rewarding side bars of this years 65th Berlin Film Festival was the restored Technicolor Section in cooperation with MoMA of New York City, and the Eastman Kodak Archive in Rochester, N.Y. Among the many choice offerings a totally restored print, fifteen minute musical preamble and all, with 15 minute intermission at the halfway mark, of ""Gone With The Wind"", the magnificent silver screen wonder of 1939 ~1940. I had seen it so long ago that I needed a refresher on the plot — Scarlett such a scheming bitch and Gable such a cool cad, Both negative characters you can't help being charmed by and rooting for both even through they are pitted against each other in a towering knock-down drag-out love-hate relationship. I had forgotten that Gable actually marries Leigh and they have a child together who gets killed in a horse jumping accident before their horrified eyes. Of course everyone remembers Gable's famous last line: ""Frankly Scarlet — I don't givva Damn! """" – but how many can recall the context? ~ It was in reply to Scarlett pleading with him not to leave her, after giving him nothing but heartache and two-timings all along — claiming that now at Long Last with the death of their child she realizes that she really loves Him — (Not wimpy high-minded Ashley Wilkes) — and exclaims pitifully as he is about to walk off: ""What will I do with out you!!"" — to which GABLE's memorable last line finally puts her in her place. It is well worth noting that in 1939 ""Damn"" was regarded as a such a strong expletive that It barely got past the damn Puritannical censors of the time! ~~ Today he could say: I don't give a flying f**k"" – and in our oversaturated four letter word world it wouldn't be half as shocking.",

It was my watching The Birth of a Nation earlier this month and that it's Black History Month that finally got me to do so. My verdict: I loved it! The story of Scarlett O'Hara and all her trials during and after the Civil War really got to me and her constant pining for Ashley Wilkes and her later relationship with Rhett Butler got me staying for the whole thing in one sitting. Vivien Leigh truly deserved her Oscar for the role of her lifetime. I wasn't so sure about Hattie McDaniel's award until her emotional scene near the end though her role-like many of the other black servant roles in the movie-do strike one of Minstrelsy especially when it came to Butterfly McQueen's. Still, there was some amusing scenes I liked among them like that of Eddie Anderson's-this was before he became well-known as Rochester on ""The Jack Benny Program"" on radio-when trying to catch a chicken! Olivia de Havilland was also fine as Melanie Hamilton and Leslie Howard likewise as Ashley Wilkes. Oh, and Clark Gable was perfect as Rhett Butler! I'll just now say if you hadn't seen Gone with the Wind yet, well, if you're so inclined, just do it! P.S.

The cinematography by Ernest Haller is truly gorgeous and add beautifully to the story as a whole. The story duration of this film is spanned over many years which seemed to drag the plot on for quite some time, especially since the screen duration is 238 minutes. But, for the most part the plot moved relatively at a fast pace. The plot was very complex. It had many love affairs going on at one time (love triangles), had the men at war and the women at home, and the multiple deaths of loved ones. I personally think that Scarlett should have given up on Ashley for Rhett Butler wayyyy before she did. This would have made the story line way more interesting. I also wished that they showed a little bit more of the men actually fighting in the war to get a gist of what that would have been like. I loved the scene when all the hundreds of bodies of the men were laying out on the ground and here comes Scarlett with her pink dress on looking for the Doc to deliver Melanie's baby. That was also a great use of cinematography. The above camera angle was perfect for that scene. Overall, even though the film was ridiculously long I did happen to thoroughly enjoy it!",

But the thing that impresses me about ""Gone with the Wind"" after seeing it recently on the big screen is that it's one hell of a good movie. The entire first half moves with a propulsive energy that not many films can match. Victor Fleming (billed as director, though there were at least four director names attached to the project) stages one sensational set piece after another, and hardly a scene goes by without a quotable line or a memorable image.",

57,2 November 2021,kevin_robbins,10, This is an all time great American cinematic masterpiece that is an absolute must see,"Gone with the Wind (1939) is a movie that was my grandmother's all time favorite film that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows the struggles of a young lady with a lot of pride and moxie and love for money and fortune and the lifestyle that goes with it. She resides in the south as they are about to head into the civil war, during the civil war and as the south initially emerges from the war. She, like most of the south, experiences lots of tragedy because of the war but she does a lot of it to herself. This movie is directed by Victor Fleming (The Wizard of Oz) and stars Clark Gable (Mutiny on the Bounty), Vivien Leigh (A Streetcar Names Desire), Barbara O'Neil (Tower of London), George Reeves (The Adventures of Superman) and Fred Crane (A Gay Amigo). The storyline for this picture is absolutely incredible with the characters being so dynamic, unpredictable and stubborn. The backdrops and landscapes were beautiful and well shot. The cinematography for this age was impressive - every set, house details, dress and prop was magnificent. The troubling circumstances honestly made me laugh, like the characters were getting what they deserved based on their beliefs. The action scenes, various fights and gun shots were great. There were so many dramatic sequences in this that were mesmerizing and well executed and really keeps the audience glued to the movie despite its run time.

The story is on the soapy side and concerns a Southern belle named Scarlett O'Hara, her obsessions, tribulations, her flaws and her (few) good points. I've never much cared for her character and have never been able to understand why anyone would. She starts out bitchy and ambitious and ends up the same way, only she's been through the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unlike most characters in serious fiction there's no real growth in Scarlett, no understanding, no self-knowledge. Everything's external with her.

Furthermore, while most today would disagree with the film's sympathetic disposition towards the south during the Civil War, everyone can agree that Gone With The Wind does an incredible job of highlighting the monumental costs of a war - the loss of lives, the strain put on those left behind afterwards, and the horribly wasteful drain of resources, money, and emotion that a war causes for everyone involved.",

Or quoted, even without knowing the origin, one of his famous phrases, such as ""Tomorrow is a new day""? Who doesn't know Tara's musical theme, composed by the brilliant Max Steiner? One of the most interesting questions to ask yourself regarding ""Gone with the Wind"" is: who is the true author of the feature film? Normally, the director is the one to whom we attribute the authorship of a film, its failure or its success. With our film, that wouldn't work. To begin with, ""Gone with the Wind"" was taken over by three directors (the official one, Victor Fleming, and the uncredited George Cukor and Sam Wood) and none of them managed to have enough freedom to give the film their vision of history and their style. This is explained by the fact that producer David O. Selznick is extremely interventionist. Selznick is one of Classic Hollywood's greatest producers. Controlling, a lover of literary adaptations and grandiose productions, he was every filmmaker's nightmare, as he always imposed his will. Selznick is arguably most responsible for the success of ""Gone with the Wind"". He bought the rights to adapt Margaret Mitchell's novel even before it became a bestseller and began production in 1936. It would, however, be unfair to attribute ""Gone with the Wind"" to Selznick alone. William Cameron Menzies, renowned art director, is responsible for the aesthetic conception of the film, as well as for the masterful use of colors, with emphasis on the characteristic saturated red. Menzies was hired by Selznick to storyboard each shot in the film. ""Gone with the Wind"" was one of the first feature films to have each of its sequences planned through the process of storyboarding. Menzies was also important for giving unity to the film, which could have been a mess due to the constant change of directors.",

The number 1 and number 3 movie phrases of all time are in this movie. I for one have used both. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are both so good in this film that if all the other characters messed up, they alone would carry the movie. Leslie Howard depicts the nobility and royalty of the South, who, when the war was lost, he too was lost. Clark Gable portrays the ultimate survivor and realist. Vivien Leigh plays a character who is in love with the dream, yet has to become a survivor at great personal cost and learning too late what is truly important to her. The director leaves out one-half of the book. Yet, he produces a wonderful, classic movie. If it weren't for the intermission, the movie would be too long.

So much of this film became an introduction to an onslaught of numerous elements of creativity to the American cinema!! ""Gone With The Wind"" was one the first recognizable color films in Hollywood!! Clark Gable's parting goodbye of ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" spurred on a nefarious notoriety which correlated to a very real aspect of candid expression!! This quote by Clark Gable has been voted by this website as the most classic line in the history of all movies ever made!! This ending line of his was considered very dare devil back in 1939!! By today's standards, of course, this seems ridiculous!! ""Gone with the Wind"" became a legendary favorite with the movie audience immediately, and it has been an all-time classic ever since!! The epic tale of Sherman's march into Atlanta at the end of the Civil War sparked a precarious nostalgia with the average American in 1939!! Scarlett O'Hara (played by Vivian Leigh) was a fickle and self serving Dixie maiden with a comical resilience!! Clark Gable was the straight forward southern gentleman who had to piece everything together!! Olivia De Havolind played Melanie, the bastion of hope for the faltering south. Lesile Howard played Ashley, Scarlett's true love!! Ashley was the man with whom Scarlett was fixated on!! Such a tale of morose, and flippant, intangibles, became a dramatic aspect to this movie!! This innovative genre easily garnered a positively peculiar camaraderie with the movie audience!! Margaret Mitchell's novel acquired a new found fascination with the American people when it got presented as this spectacular extravaganza of a motion picture!! ""Gone with the Wind"" won for best picture in 1939!! I have not seen ""Gone With The Wind"" in quite some time now, but, I did enjoy the film the last time I viewed it. The cast, the costuming, and the classic lines to this film are all first rate!! If you are interested in seeing one of the all time flicks in movie history, than, it is an absolutely must for you to see this film!!",

Every frame of the film drips with sheer perfection. The sets are grand, the acting marvelous, and the direction impeccable. My favorite thing about ""Gone With The Wind"" would have to be the cast. Hattie MacDaniel was marvelous as Mammy, Olivia DeHaviland heavenly as Melanie, Leslie Howard great as Ashley, and Clark Gable is sheer perfection as Rhett Butler. Last but certainly not least, Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara.",
80,19 March 2016,anaconda-40658,9, Gone With Innocence.,"Gone With the Wind (1939): Dir: Victor Fleming / Cast: Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Havilland, Hattie McDaniel: Gone is love. Gone is passion. Gone is humanity. Set during the Civil War with Vivien Leigh playing Scarlett O'Hara, who lives on a plantation and is targeted by every guy. She seeks marriage with Ashley Wilkes, played by Leslie Howard, but he is announcing his engagement to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, played by Olivia de Havilland. O'Hara catches the eye of a sly playboy Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, whom she detests, but he aims to marry her. Director Victor Fleming was blessed this year having also made The Wizard of Oz. Great moments include an exhilarating fire of <>Atlantic and the getaway by horse and wagon. Flawed by a corny reoccurring death between two character generations, as well as layered negativity leading to its concluding payoff. Leigh plays O'Hara, widowed after two marriages, yet her pining for Ashley determines her downfall. As Rhett, Gable is charming until he is unable to sustain the love of this woman even when their daughter dies after being thrown from a horse. Howard plays the frustrated and worn Ashley, and de Havilland plays the ill yet gentle spirit of Melanie. Hattie McDaniel comically steals scenes as Mammy the maid. Extraordinary vision of war and passions drained yet the promise of ""tomorrow being another day."" Score: 9 / 10",

83,13 December 2022,catherinewilliamss,10, twenty twenty two,"Gone With the Wind is a title that has been stuck in the back of my mind for as long as I can remember, although I had never watched it until recently. I had preconceived notions of the film, I thought that it would be not only incredibly boring but ignorantly racist as well. And while I cannot deny the obvious romanticism of the Civil War era that was not historically accurate, a product of its time, this movie was anything but boring. For a film made in 1939, the visual and performance aspects of the movie are incredibly impressive. Vivian Leigh's performance as Scarlett radiated off the screen to depict the vivacious, determined and selfish southern belle, whose disillusionment of love and greed is what led her throughout the movie. This performance is just simply unparalleled even today. Gone With the Wind's ability to stay relevant and the highest grossing film in 2022 is extremely impressive.",

A realistic fiction that ends abruptly and leaves it's viewer/reader starving for more but unfortunately never produced a sequel. A book was written in the 90s that continued the story but trust me, it sucked. Scarlett was such a complex character, selfish, spirited, passionate about everything she wants. But in the end you see that Scarlett changes, she learns about communication and respect for all those who love her after she lost everyone who did. Never read the sequel if you read the first one because it isn't a Margaret Mitchell novel and therefor you won't SEE the complexity. Those of you who voted for this movie to have one star, I pity you. You cannot see the complexity or beauty of this wonderful tale or you just didn't see it and decided to vote for a movie you thought would be stupid when in fact it is the most popular civil war movie in history.

Clark Gable was ideal as Rhett Butler and by today's standards, maybe a bit over the top in some scenes, but still excellent. Melanie, a very difficult part was played to perfection by Olivia de Havilland, while Hattie McDaniel's Mammy was brilliant. You can go through the whole cast and rate them so high.

93,22 May 2018,gab-14712,10, The Best Film of All Time?,"Behold one of the greatest if not the greatest movie of all time! Gone with the Wind is the 1939 masterpiece that producer David Selznik and director Victor Fleming brought to life. Selznick was the genius who wanted to combine melodrama with advanced production techniques and that line of thinking gave birth to this film. Everything about this movie is perfect from the lush cinematography to the portrayal of women and people of color to the cultural power this movie has given to the world of cinema. For a movie that was released in December 1939, it by far exceeds the quality of film expected of that time and certainly almost beats every film made today. Without further ado, lets delve right into this masterpiece!
This movie is broken into two sections; pre-Civil War and post-Civil War. Scarlett (Vivien Leigh) is a strong-willed woman dealing with the pressures of war. With Atlanta burning and the Union Army advancing, she is put through a lot. However, she has feelings for Ashley (Leslie Howard). But Ashley is set to marry her cousin, Melanie (Olivia de Havilland). Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) warns Scarlett to put her feelings aside as the family celebrates the marriage. There is a new, mysterious man at the party, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) who might be the one to change Scarlett's life. 
The movie has a lot of interesting themes. One theme is how women is portrayed. Scarlett acts more like a headstrong woman of the 1930's. The appeal of her character is how she individually goes after her own destiny; both economically (planting cotton and owning a lumber business) and sexually (going after the men she chooses). Audiences at the time were fascinated by her character standing up to the male characters, but she had to be punished in the end because they don't simply allow that sort of woman to stay unleashed for so long. That is where the famous phrase spoken by Rhett Butler, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,"" comes from. 
 Another interesting theme is the portrayal of African Americans. There may be points of racism, but keep in mind that this film was made when there were still Jim Crow segregation laws in the South. The movie does sidestep that plantations came from the era of slavery. More sympathy is given to the calluses on Scarlett's hands as she works. Unlike any film of this time, at least African American characters were given a sense of humanity. Hattie McDaniel as Mammy comes away as the most sensible character in the movie. She has many good lines, and she completely deserved her Oscar win. Hattie happened to be the first African American ever to win an Academy Award. 
 It's no secret that the roles of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler were two of the most coveted roles of the century. Fortunately, both Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh were able to meet or even exceed the sky-high expectations already set for them. This film seemed perfect for the two actors with incredibly big egos. Gable with his party-boy attitude delivered maybe his best performance as an actor and Leigh, the beautiful actress known for her drug abuse really shined as the likable, mesmerizing Scarlett. 
 One of the amazing things about Gone with the Wind is the breathtaking visuals. Many films of the era had a bland look about them, but this is not one of those films. Ernest Haller's cinematography is the best I have ever seen. The film makes great use of showing off its gorgeous landscape. The burning of Atlanta scenes really brought the movie to life as well. The use of color and lighting is phenomenal. Also, the film produced one of the greatest scores of all time. Before the likes of John Williams or James Horner, we had Max Steiner. Listening to the score really brings out the goosebumps. This score is definitely one of my favorite scores. 
 Nominated for 10 Academy Awards, Gone with the Wind is a majestic, sweeping epic that details a romance within the backdrop of the Civil War. This movie will make tears fall down your face, will make you laugh, will make you shudder up with tension, and so on. Even though the movie is some four hours long, this movie is the definition of why we go to the movies. It tells a great story, and it tells it well. Along with the Wizard of Oz, 1939 turned out to be a banner year for film. ",

97,17 December 2014,JLRMovieReviews,10, Margaret Mitchell's Legacy - Tomorrow is Another Day,"Young Scarlett is infatuated with Ashley Wilkes, but is disappointed to say the least when she hears of his engagement to Melanie Wilkes, who's a goody-two-shoes and Scarlett cares nothing for. Such begins the life, loves and whims of young Scarlett O'Hara in this Civil War-era story. Why is there another review to add to the already many reviews of this granddaddy of all movies? As I saw this for the umpteenth time recently, it crossed my mind that I hadn't reviewed it and to give a heads up for all those young enough to have never seen it or been introduced to it by their parents and are interested in seeing this long movie. What's so great about this movie, anyway? To begin with, author Margaret Mitchell was not your average girl growing up at the beginning of the 20th century. She was an independent creature who possessed a determined mind and a different outlook on the way things are supposed to be. To say she was a tomboy was to put in mildly. She was nicknamed ""Jimmy,"" by those who knew her tomboyish ways and she loved the nickname. She was also called ""Peggy"" by her mother, which was a nickname for Margaret. She loved writing even as a young girl and would be writing constantly in her diary. Years later, the idea came to her for a novel when she recalled from her youth the time her mother took her to all the plantations and lands that once were prosperous during the pre-Civil War days and how the people lived and how they lost all they had when the war came, and it intrigued her how the families and generations must have endured that terrible inevitable war. Her mother's point in telling all this to young Peggy was to instill in Margaret a survival instinct. Drawing on her own husbands and beaus, Margaret conceived of the leads of Rhett Butler and Ashley Wilkes. And even the young girl's name was not Scarlett in the beginning, but Patsy. Taking three years, she wrote laboriously until she got her draft the way she wanted it, somewhat. She began her story with the end and wrote backwards. So she knew what her vision and her message was, even from the first word. Given the fact Margaret Mitchell was an independent person, the book's ending is not totaling surprising. It was really all about survival, no matter what. But what plagued her throughout writing was her first chapter. Not feeling completely satisfied, she shelved it, despite her insistence of her second husband and a publisher. When girlfriends heard of this novel, one of them made a remark that would change not only film history, but book history: ""Margaret, you wrote a book! You? I didn't know you had it in you."" With this anger and almost uncontrollable rage of being put in her place, Margaret got her draft and gave it to her publisher friend. Although he said it needed work, he was in awe of what he read. Despite the fact Americans were in the midst of the depression, ""Gone with the Wind"" took them by storm. Due to its bulkiness, it cost $3, and Margaret was impressed that anyone would spend $3 for it, given the hard times. ""Gone with the Wind"" broke all book records and still today sells hundreds of thousands of copies each year. With the name change to Scarlett encouraged by the publishers, ""Gone with the Wind"" was an extravaganza that debuted on December 15, 1939 in Atlanta, Georgia with most of the cast there, except for the black supporting players. Winning 10 Oscars for Vivien Leigh as Scarlett, Best Picture and Best Director, this has been the definitive example of story-telling splashed on film. Director George Cukor started production but was replaced by Victor Fleming who was credited and who received the award. Ben-Hur would later break the record for the most Oscars, but it's ""Gone with the Wind""'s characters and their real flaws and dreams that have kept this film alive and in the hearts and imaginations of generations ever since. Upon seeing again, it occurred to me that once you have seen a movie over and over, sometimes it feel like you're just seeing it automatically, having it all memorized. But the magic of ""Gone with the Wind"" is that you are transported to another time that is made so real and so vivid that you never feel bored or unaffected with what you're watching. There are too many good actors in this to go into that, but suffice it to say that neither Clark Gable nor Leslie Howard wanted to be in this film, Clark for fear he could not live up to the young ladies' expectations of a Rhett Butler and because it was essentially a woman's film and Leslie Howard felt that Ashley was weak and Leslie Howard had a reputation as a ladies' man. And, the role of Scarlett O'Hara was the role of a lifetime, and that's another story of how they were filming the burning of Atlanta when in walks Vivien Leigh. End of discussion. Why should anyone today, new generations and you watch this film – because it shows you how to write films, how to develop strong characters, because it is part of our culture that shows what we came from and where we may be going in the future. That's just a few reasons. For sheer entertainment, nothing can really top this – no words are big enough or opulent enough – to describe the experience of watching ""Gone with the Wind,"" especially for the first time. It's cinematically beautiful, majestic, stirring, and stupendous. Well, less is more, so suffice it to say, I would recommend ""Gone with the Wind"" to anyone serious about watching good films and interested seriously about making movies. Margaret Mitchell left quite a legacy – the dreams, the hopes, the drive of a young woman who influenced the world.",

So many of these are such a part of Americana, I found myself anticipating famous quotes and scenes. I never felt much empathy for Scarlett or for Rhett. There is a chemistry that can't be explained rationally. There's that incredible score that swells and moves and makes what would be much less magnificent into true events. The acting is a bit over the top at times. People are often caricatures. One needs to overlook that racism or you can't watch this movie.

True Scarlet O'Hara is a foolish woman who believes she is madly in love with someone else's husband, but she is just as bad as the proud Rhett Butler who loves her through it all. Their problem is admitting their true feelings deep down, and in this small selfish act is where we find the heart of the story and it's timelessness. We all love that great, timeless love story despite it's tragic ending, and Scarlet's tenacity for surviving and keeping her family alive, even if it did involve tricks and schemes on her part. Despite all this, the film managed to capture the heart of Americans everywhere and even those hearts of the generations that followed. That is the true power of this film.

Glorious Technicolor, magnificent cast who make their characters their own, wonderful landscapes, excellent, beautiful costumes, rich and warm music, true and believable acting. And the beauty of this movie that it could have been made yesterday - it truly looks like it. Sometimes I just watch it and not pay attention to the characters, just look at the landscapes, decor and dresses, however that is hard to do because the characters are so darn interesting. I find Rhett and Scarlett hard to hate. Rhett because obviously he is very attractive and kind, despite going to prostitutes. Scarlett has been through so much and can be very kind sometimes, but on the other hand she is a manipulative, difficult so-and-so. After you see this movie, you cannot imagine anyone else in these roles. Thanks to the Four Disk Special Edition, you can see who came very close to claiming the roles (the special edition DVD is a must for any devoted Gone With The Wind fan - the special features are wonderful!! The only thing that I was disappointed with is that there are no outtakes! Outtakes are the best! But it is a very valuable, informative DVD.) I love Gone With The Wind.

Selznick sold his interest in the film within years; Margaret Mitchell remarked on publication that she hoped the book would sell a few thousand copies(!).  So it's a huge mistake to judge WIND on any terms but its own -- what it ""was"", and then, what it ""is"".  Today we see a colorful, vividly realized costume epic.  But in 1939, it seemed like the Sistine Chapel had come to life and was appearing at the downtown Rialto.  Forgive the silly metaphor, but you get what I'm after -- the size and scope of WIND on film had no precedent.  Released in the shadow of the Great Depression, WIND in hindsight is less about the Civil War than a nation's slow crawl out of recent poverty.  When Scarlett said `I'll never be hungry again,' the nation rose and said `Damn Right!'  The moment was set to fiery, defiant music, and the illusion of America, as she wanted to see herself, was set. History, right or wrong, was suddenly embodied by a sexy young girl who wants, not just to survive, but to prosper.  Powerful stuff.  But is that enough to hold our attention, year after year, decade after decade?  WIND is still visually persuasive and always will be.  Max Steiner's score beneath those images cannot be underestimated -- there had never been so much music outside the realm of grand opera.  Music completes the illusion.  The script however, full of momentum, has little substance.  It weakens as years go by. Mitchell was no Tolstoy, but her brilliant novel is condensed to a long, shallow, sentimental melodrama.  The writing is redeemed only by two key performances:  Hattie McDaniel, as Mammy, is the first African American allowed to create a real human being on screen (for that we thank David O. Selznick); and of course, Vivien Leigh's complex, amazingly sexual Scarlett. In a strange mix of glamour and guts, the vortex of her acting seems to create the film around her; she wills it to happen.  After 35 years of watching, I've come to regard her as, not merely the leading actress, but the real director of Gone With the Wind -- and the reason to keep watching.",

If it were not for her nobody would have noticed this run-of-the -mill production. It has no cultural or intellectual worth. At least it has no story to tell the world. I am sure that American history could have furnished a film crew with a better plot or a more breathtaking love story. Only incurable pragmatics can learn something from this film and this is how to kill a human being in oneself to earn money.

Selznick production.Victor Fleming is its director.Also George Cukor and Sam Wood worked briefly in the project.The movie is based on Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer-winning novel from 1936.Selznick had troubles finding the female star.But eventually the right gal was found.The role of Scarlett O'Hara went to Vivien Leigh.Everybody knew Clark Gable would be the right man to play Rhett Butler.Leslie Howard had to be made look younger as Ashley Wilkes.My favorite character must be Melanie Hamilton, who is played by the lovely Olivia de Havilland.She is one of the few cast members to be still alive today.Olivia turned 95 last year.Thomas Mitchell plays Gerald O'Hara.Barbara O'Neil plays Ellen O'Hara.Evelyn Keyes is Suellen and Ann Rutherford is Carreen O'Hara.The latter one is 91 today.Hattie McDaniel portrays Mammy.She was the first black American to win an Oscar.It won nine more of those.Another black actress, Butterfly McQueen plays Prissy, a character quite the opposite of Mammy.Ward Bond is seen as Tom, Yankee Captain.Alicia Rhett plays India Wilkes.She is the oldest (b. 1915) surviving cast member.Other surviving members are Mary Anderson (Mary Merriweather) and Mickey Kuhn (Beau Wilkes).The movie has plenty of classic moments, like that ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"".They had some problems with using the word damn.Luckily they got away with it, because ""Frankly my dear, I just don't care"" would have sounded lame.This movie has a reputation as a chick flick.But there's also the war theme, so I can't see why us men can't enjoy the movie as well.Sure it's possible that women get more out of it, but no one can deny the movie's classic value.The year 1939 was a good year, movie-wise.This movie, that was made in glorious Technicolor, is one of the brightest classics from that year.",
151,19 July 2018,weezeralfalfa,9," A coming of age story, among other things","Although not usually described as such, among other things, book author Margaret Mitchell(MM) meant this to be a coming of age story for Scarlett, who ages from 16 to 28 in the book. It doesn't seem quite that long in the movie. Scarlett is partly based on MM herself. Like Scarlet, she was a society debutant, often with a flock of beaus simultaneously. According to the book, and somewhat exemplified in the movie, Scarlett has little taste for sex, finding it often painful and embarrassing, and sometimes leading to the more painful process of birth. She decides that she doesn't want any more babies after the first, because her waist expanded after her first birthing. Thus, lovers find it frustrating that this beauty is so frigid. .....Another overpowering theme of the book and movie is the differences in skill and luck in surviving adversity. Both Rhett and Ashley are survivals of the war, whereas most of their neighbors and relatives are not. Scarlett and Melanie are also survivors, sometimes using men to get their post-war businesses on their feet. In some ways, Scarlett is a feminist. She has good native intelligence, is manipulative, becomes a good manager of her plantation, and her new lumber business. She has learned that she can get along without a man. However, I'm puzzled by her parting question, as Rhett leaves for good: ""Where will I go? What will I do""? She still had her plantation, which seemed to be operating at a profit. She had managed before without a man. She probably would like to have another child, or perhaps take in several of the many orphans or widows left from the war, since she's worried about the effect of pregnancy on her figure. Since Ashley is now a widower, she might finagle him into a largely sexless marriage?........It's not real apparent to me why Rhett is wealthy. Perhaps from his blockade running? Also, apparently, he became a scalawag after the war, which may have brought in some income........Neither Gable nor Leslie Howard(Ashley) wanted to be in this movie. For one thing, Gable dismissed it as ""a woman's movie"". Howard thought he was far too old(46) to be playing a supposedly 21 y.o. when Scarlett was 16. However, the casting director felt he had the best personality and physique to play the effete Ashley. In contrast, there was much competition for the roles of Scarlet and Melanie. George Cukor: the beginning director, was famous as a woman's director, in contrast to his replacement: Victor Fleming. Thus, after he was canned, Cukor still coached Vivien Leigh (Scarlett) and Olivia DeHavilland (Melanie) on weekends!.......It's strange that Melanie died soon after collapsing(swooning?), just after she exited Rhett's room, where he was mourning the death of his daughter. Suggests she had some underlying health problem, that was enhanced by psychological stress........This was but one of several tragedies late in the film. Of course, the accidental death of Rhett's and Scarlett's little girl was a shock. Rhett seemed more disturbed than Scarlett, apparently feeling that his marriage was jinxed, which accelerated his determination to opt out of the marriage......Then, there was a the pervasive tragedy of Scarlett's unreciprocated love of Ashley, and the fact that she didn't really warm up to Rhett consistently until it was too late.......Of course, the cinematography, production values, sets, costumes, and acting are all topnotch, not to mention the very memorable theme song.",

I wanted to be blown away by the scenes, I wanted characters that would invite me into their worlds and never make me leave, I wanted tragedy on a grand scale, but alas, that wasn't what I witnessed with Gone with the Wind. Somehow I ending this film with a sense of astonishment, a sense of being robbed, and not at all the romantic film I thought I would be enjoying. Instead I saw hatred, sexism, racism, alcoholism, anti-love, pro-Confederacy, and ignorance all rolled up together into a two-disc packaging, which would be later called Gone with the Wind.

Driven passionately towards her single goal, Scarlett will let few obstacles stand in her way until she is married to Ashley. While she pines after her goal, Scarlett allows Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) to chase after her and even the great Civil War becomes but a backdrop to her story.

Selznick must have known in advance that 'Gone with the Wind (1939)' would become the highest-grossing motion picture ever made. He purchased the rights to Margaret Mitchell's bestselling novel for an unprecedented $50,000, heaped a truckload of money into the project and exhausted the efforts of no less than three directors  Victor Fleming, George Cukor, Sam Wood and possibly a few others, including William Cameron Menzies and B. Reeves Eason. Such was Selznick's passion for the project that he is typically credited as the prime architect of the film's success, a definitive exception to the auteur theory  unless, of course, one simply considers Selznick to be the auteur. The extravagance of the production is instantly recognised in the film's elaborate costume and set design, in addition to Ernest Haller's sweeping epic cinematography. If it weren't for such lavishness, the picture might easily have vanished into the background as a stuffy, overwrought melodrama; but film-making of this magnitude leaves a considerable imprint on one's memory, and audiences have come to epitomise 'Gone with the Wind' as the embodiment of Hollywood's Golden Age.",

160,27 January 2016,TheGoforth,8, The Epic and The Soap Opera...,"I have a theory that the whole American daytime soap aesthetic was inspired by the second half of Gone with the Wind, in terms of the staging, lighting and dialogue. It becomes a story about interpersonal relationships, whereas the first half of the movie relates to the characters more in the context of their time and history. For these reasons, I can see why the film has mass appeal, because it tells its story through two sensibilities. Had George Cukor remained as director, I am sure the whole film would have been more in line with the soap opera approach, but the Victor Fleming touch gave it the epic grandeur and vitality that makes the first half of the movie breathtaking. In my opinion, you have to really invest in the characters in order for the second half of the movie to keep you captivated. As far as GWTW is concerned, the only disadvantage of changing its approach is that by the end of the film, several events happen in such rapid succession of each other that something feels unnatural and forced. This is because the very power of the soap opera approach lies in its ability to draw narrative out in a way that is driven by character and not plot: slowly, meticulously and over a long period of time... and this is why film was never the soap opera's favoured medium, because most mainstream movies are contained narratives and need to be plot driven to meet their criteria. And that is the very reason why women tend to be secondary in modern Hollywood, because most men are traditionally yearning for action and adventure and women reflect on their feelings and motivations: you can make a box office hit that meets the former criteria quite easily, but the latter is something that is so incredibly complex, you had best turn to literature and television soap opera/serial drama for it to be fully realised. Gone with the Wind and Titanic managed to bring the epic and soap opera together, which is why they resonated profoundly with the culture. ",

Scarlett O' Hara is the eldest daughter of a rich landowner in the 1860s American South. Surrounded by beaux, she is interested only in Ashley Wilkes, and is crushed to find that he will be marrying his cousin, Melanie Hamilton. She pleads and makes a scene at his house during a party, and later discovers that Rhett Butler, a wealthy young man with a shady reputation, has overheard everything. To get back at Ashley, she marries his soon-to-be brother-in-law, Charles Hamilton, just before the men go off for war. Set during the American Civil War, the movie a good number of years, during which we see the Southern states devastated, Scarlett's family home stripped bare and previously rich landowners bankrupted. Scarlett's strong sense of self- preservation makes her to determined to do whatever it takes, marriage included to keep her land and live comfortably.

Yes this is close to 4 hours long but't it is never boring! ( Something todays directors should note). Every frame of this movie is a work of art. This is grand entertainment and once you watch it you will never forget it! In case you don't know the story that is even better! However I recommend this on a rainy afternoon when you can sit by the fireplace and enjoy! Once you see this movie you will want to run out and visit the south! Yes the movie has its critics but every movie does. In my opinion this movie is perfect. If I had one complaint about is that Clark Gable didn't win the Academy Award for this movie. However that year was 1939 and almost all movies that year that were released were way above average. If you enjoy movies about old Hollywood you should see ""The Making a Legend: The Making of Gone With The Wind"".",
172,23 December 2008,weekly-movie-review,10, Gone With The Wind is one of those absolutely essential films that all movie lovers must see before they die.,"Gone With The Wind is one of those absolutely essential films that all movie lovers must see before they die. This Civil War epic romance/drama centers around a rather spoiled and selfish young Southern belle named Scarlett. The story follows her through the blissful paradises of plantation dances and pretty dresses to the bitter, cold realities of war and scraping up the pieces afterward. During these trials and tribulations, many very complex relationships and people are examined, all the while using Scarlett as the catalyst. Victor Fleming's visual interpretation of Margaret Mitchell's famous novel is nearly flawless and represents, in my opinion, exactly how a story like this should be told. The lavish sets and costumes burst from the screen in an explosion of color. The cinematography and visual effects evoke a certain dream-like fantasy at certain times and offer stunning realism at others. It's hard to believe this movie was made 70 years ago and it's easy to see why this movie was considered so far ahead of its time upon its release. However, as great as these elements are, the aspect that makes Gone With The Wind a timeless classic is the great performance by the cast. Most have heard of Vivien Leigh's career-defining performance as Scarlett and the way she makes the viewer both love her and hate her with equally burning passions, or of Clark Gable's equally good role as Rhett Bulter, the self-reliant, and some might say, self-centered man who comes to understand the value of integrity and character. But sometimes these two giants overshadow very underrated performances by Leslie Howard, Hattie McDaniel, and Olivia de Havilland. Leslie Howard does a tremendous job of relating to the viewer the inner torment of love versus lust that his character deals with everyday. McDaniel offers a lovable toughness, wisdom, and discipline as the house servant. De Havilland's performance is the most pleasantly surprising, however. In every scene, her character emits purity and goodness in abundance. She truly demonstrates an unconditional love to all those around her despite the difficult circumstances she often finds herself in and is the perfect example of the model that other humans should aspire to become. Through and through, Gone With The Wind is a story that will probably never grow irrelevant, and this 4-hour movie is an astonishing masterpiece that is able to bring deep-buried emotions out of even the most hardened of hearts.",

The pacing is spot-on, and while this has a running time of around three hours and forty minutes, it is never boring. It is simply so engaging and interesting. All roles are well-cast, and the acting is flawless. Leigh is impeccable, as is Gable, and frankly, everyone else.

Dialog has utterly golden, unforgettable and quotable lines, and is always delivered to perfection. The music is a grand, instrumental score.

Scarlette O'Hara is perhaps the most selfish, most annoying character ever committed to celluloid, and Rhett Butler is not much better. I sympathized with him, though, because his rudeness came about when having to deal with HER. And about the racism: you may attribute the casual racism to the era in which GWTW was made, but I feel this is unfair. Sure, people were racist at the time, in the North and in the South, but few in the 1930s would have argued against emancipation. This film is NOT just trying to depict how things were in the 1860s, but is actually arguing for slavery. And against the 15th amendment (? maybe 14th; blacks' right to vote, anyways).

Nevertheless, it is excellent, probably one of the best films of all time. It tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and how she deals with a long-time struggle trying to get the man she loves (Ashley, played by Leslie Howard) to fall in love with her, unaware that the whole time she is actually falling in love with Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), the tough-yet-romantic character who she thought would never appeal to her. Vivien Leigh is perfectly cast here, in an Oscar-winning role in this Best Picture of 1939. She makes the character of Scarlett believable and lovable, despite the over-controlling and selfish nature she often possesses. Gable was robbed of an Oscar here, as he plays one of the most engaging, tough, and fun characters ever seen on film, delivering one great line after another (down to his famous ""Frankly, my dear...""). The supporting cast, particularly Oscar-winner Hattie McDaniel as Mammy, is perfect, and really makes the film.

At that time it created a havoc at theaters by grossing close to $400 million which is now equal to more than $3000 million. The lead character Scarlett is a rich spoilt manipulative selfish girl in the times of American civil war and meets her counterpart in Rhett another spoilt gentleman who falls in love with her because she is as bad as him. But both lead actors are honest to each other and they have a habit of never quitting even in the gravest danger. The movie is a journey of Scarlett from pre war to post war times in Georgia. She marries two times; once for revenge and once for money before she finally marries to our hero. You must be thinking what good it would be to live through journey of such flawed characters? Well, the fun lies in the well written drama, soothing back ground score, delicious dialogs, colorful rich sets and an array of small but significant characters around Scarlett. The movie never tries to make a point and showcases both selfish and kind characters with equal love. The movie is special because it does not seem dated at all and charms you even after 70 years.",
216,26 July 2016,PurpleFilm,10, THE Hollywood Period Classic Film,"""Gone with the wind"" is the best story - the best book adaptation - the best classic film ever. I first saw it when I was just a kid, and I immediately fell in love with it. I re- watched it millions of times. And I still can't get enough. Scarlet O'Hara is one of the best film/book characters of history as she represents the spoiled flirty Southern Belle that - when in need - can react to destiny and war and fight like a tiger to survive. She is my idol. Strength combined with beauty, passion with a tantrum, shrewdness with sweetness. The only thing I hate about this heroine (apart from basically killing the poor horse when she finally reaches the ruins of Tara) is her blindness: she just cannot recognise Real Love and a Real Man. The book isn't altered too much, but something is different compared to Margaret Mitchell's masterpiece. However, the war and the slavery are well pictured, the intensity of the story and every single character is strong; the setting is just perfect, in particular if we note that this movie was made in 1939! I think ""Gone with the wind"" is the most genuine mix of love story, war narrative, great acting (the charming Rhett Butler played by the superb Clark Gable, the weak Melania played by Olivia de Havilland - the only living actor from this movie) and amazing music scores. It is definitely a must- see and the 220 minutes time just flies.",

I love the scene where Mammy is trying to get Scarlett to eat her breakfast before the barbecue, and gives her a dig about Ashley not proposing to her. The sideways look of death that Scarlett gives her, and her own smug expression when she knows she's won the exchange...brilliant. Also the scene at the barbecue just after she's overheard the other girls criticizing her, and she slowly climbs up the stairs, completely oblivious to everyone else running down the stairs around her whooping and hollering. And the scene at Aunt Pity's house on Christmas night where Scarlett stands alone at the bottom of the stairs watching Ashley take Melanie to bed was one of the few that made me feel sorry for her.",

However, labeling it as such might be stretching the truth somewhat. It may have been the most financially successful film in the history of motion pictures, but box-office receipts do not automatically translate into quality. The film has many strong points, but it also has its share of weaknesses; being completely uncritical towards it, as many have been, is a closed-minded attitude. It went through several different directors and writers, most of whom have not received credit for their efforts, which may explain its unevenness. The true ""author"" of the film is legendary producer David O. Selznick, to whom the movie was his pride and joy.",

225,6 September 2005,jboothmillard,9, Gone with the Wind,"35 million people saw this film, all four hours of it (I know this because it was number 1 on The Ultimate Film), and it is a great romance, with the American Civil War in between, ignore the black slavery aspects, from Oscar winning director Victor Fleming (The Wizard of Oz, out the same year). Basically, trying to be brief, the story, set in 1861 on a large cotton plantation called Tara, revolves around the life of the O'Hara family. Mainly, Scarlett O'Hara (Oscar winning Vivien Leigh), she has been in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) for a long time, and he at one point possibly mentioned marriage, but he is now set to marry her cousin Melanie Hamilton (Oscar nominated Olivia De Havilland). In a vengeful mood, Scarlett agrees to marry the enthusiastic Frank Kennedy (Carroll Nye), who dies soon from measles when he enters the war, and Scarlett has now become a business woman. At that point the man who eyed her at a barbecue party, Rhett Butler (Oscar nominated Clark Gable, who had already won two), proposes marriage, but she is too self involved to agree. Then, not long later the war really hits home (literally), and everyone has to get out of town before the Yankees kill them. After the war has settled for a while, Scarlett has saved Melanie and her baby, she returns to her old house where the servants, including trustworthy, but easily annoyed Mammy (Oscar winning Hattie McDaniel, the first black woman ever to win one), and when the mother dies becomes head of the house. For a while, the story continues as the remaining family patching up the house partly destroyed. Rhett also returns from the Civil War to make a final commitment with Scarlett, and they also have a little girl. Years pass, and Scarlett and Rhett are starting to drift from each other and hate each other. More trauma follows when she reveals another baby, but falls down the stairs, and also their daughter Bonnie Blue Butler (Cammie King) is killed after falling off her horse. The concluding parts of the film see Melanie near death and asking Scarlett to promises to look after Ashley, and Rhett thinking that Scarlett still loves him. In the end, Scarlett has truly forgotten her love for Ashley and fallen for Rhett, but it is too late, because with the confusion, a lost baby and a dead daughter (was there a divorce though?), Rhett decides to go back home to Charleston, Scarlett is very upset, but does remember Ashely and Rhett both mentioning hope at her home land of Tara, I can't understand how, but she sees hope in getting her true love back. Phew! Also starring Thomas Mitchell as Gerald O'Hara, Barbara O'Neil as Ellen O'Hara, Laura Hope Crews as Aunt ""Pittypat"" Hamilton, Harry Davenport as Dr. Meade, Evelyn Keyes as Suellen O'Hara, Ann Rutherford as Careen O'Hara, Butterfly McQueen as Prissy, Alicia Rhett as India Wilkes and Everett Brown as Big Sam. Leigh is truly remarkable as Scarlett who can fake crying to get her own way, be heroic during the war and pain of others, and show true emotions about all situations in her journey, and Gable is just as good as Rhett. A long film, but if you can stay awake (which I did the second time), well worth it. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing; Best Writing, Screenplay, Technical Achievement Award and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Special Effects, Best Music for Max Steiner, Best Sound and an Honorary Award for William Cameron Menzies (for use of colour).

All of this is set against great spectacle and even some ingenious special effects, (the production looks more lavish than it is, due to clever trick photography in some scenes). The fact that people still talk and rave about this story shows that it still stands the test of time. Acting, music, production, photography, and script are all outstanding. It never ceases to be entertaining, and even the outdated attitudes about some aspects of race can be forgiven, as they were consistent with the novel and the time that the story takes place in.

229,29 March 2008,moonspinner55,7," ""With enough courage, you can do without a reputation...""","Civil War-era love story, with spoiled Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara sparring with frequently-reluctant Rhett Butler, a blockade runner and smooth-talking charmer. From the sprawling bestseller by Margaret Mitchell, this beautiful-looking M-G-M production is filmed in eye-popping colors and enacted grandly by a well-chosen cast. Still, for modern tastes, this period in history is becoming more uncomfortable to tread through, especially for those with an unobjective eye. Emotions or personal bias may tend to rule out the romantic drama at the heart of the story, leaving the rest of the narrative seeming like ripened balderdash. Even so, it would be difficult to fault the main performances, with Clark Gable's Rhett the quintessential playboy and Vivien Leigh winning the Best Actress Oscar for her nearly-flawless performance as Scarlett (though real Southerners tend to balk at her accent). At nearly four hours, one begins to squirm after awhile, though Victor Fleming's Oscar-winning direction keeps the calamities coming at a spirited pace. Screenwriter Sidney Howard received a statue for his adaptation; Hattie McDaniel was also awarded for her typically rousing supporting turn as Scarlett's all-seeing, all-knowing ""Mammy"". Second-half, in which Scarlett returns to Tara after the Yankees have scorched the land and raped the property, is the most gripping section of the movie, let down a bit once Leslie Howard's Ashley Wilkes returns from a Yankee prison (Howard's performance is fine, if colorless). The film was named Best Picture of 1939, no small feat as this is generally considered one of the most prolific years for the entertainment industry. *** from ****",

231,3 January 2016,brunoconceicao,10, Can anyone believe this movie was made on the 30???,"It is complex write anything about ""Gone With the Wind"" because I have the impression that everything or almost everything has been said about this work that remains current and exciting after 76 years. ""Gone With the Wind"" is far from being an art film, but this fact does not diminish its greatness. ""Gone With the Wind"" is a prime example of that commercial films can be very good and well made. Commercial films do not necessarily need to be based on cliché's and conventional or happy endings. It can be said that the film was bold by the standards of the time, to invest in a young, brave and stubborn girl, however, full of flaws like any real person. Scarlett drinks, flirts a married man, eat too much in public, negotiates with enemies, collects the debts of friends, accepted dance despite being in mourning, finally defies all moral severely respected by the society to which it belongs. But it does not get to indulge with the transgression. Quite the opposite. Deep down, she is a moralist who lived intensely admires the straight and values ​​taught by her mother. She transgresses to survive and to enforce their will. She transgresses to keep the land left by parents who for her, symbolically, it was the parents themselves. To Scarlett, violate or transgress not is not the issue. The question is to survive. Scarlett is a survivor of war, hunger, poverty, the tragic loss of their parents, a never materialized love. Although, it is seen as a great heroine for his tireless ability to fight, Scarlett in a way, it is a loser. As the character of Clark Gable said, she throws out happiness with both hands. ""Gone With the Wind"" is much more than an epic; It is much more than a movie about the war and its consequences; is a film about determination and survival figures incarnated on earth image. Another factor that deserves special attention is the character Melanie. We are not sure to what extent she knows the real feelings and personality of Scarlett, which is a very interesting open issue. A memorable soundtrack! A 5 stars classic. I know a person that watch this movie 5 times!!!!",
232,1 May 2014,dwpollar,8, Wonderful portrayal of a couple of people who refuse to be happy...,"1st watched 4/27/2014 -- 8 out of 10(Dir-Victor Fleming): Wonderful portrayal of a couple of people who refuse to be happy in the anti-heroes of Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, and Scarlett O'Hara, played by Vivian Leigh. Yes -- the movie is about the downfall of the old South, how people learn to survive thru desperate times, but mostly it's a saddening portrait of lost souls, in my opinion. The movie begins as 2 plantations in the pre-Civil war south live a life of grandeur but it is soon challenged by an inevitable war that threatens to ruin the fantasy world that they lived in -- and thus is ""Gone with the Wind."" Scarlett is a character that is used to getting what she wants due to her prestige or her good looks -- but she definitely can't handle things initially with they don't go her own way. She learns to manipulate and do whatever it takes to attempt to have her needs satisfied but constantly is denied her main pursuit which is trying to get her sister's fiancée to love her, and she pursues this up to almost the end of the movie. Rhett Butler is a wanderer who is really a lot like Scarlett but does eventually learn primarily because of having a daughter. This movie, based on the Margaret Mitchell novel, is mostly about character and shows us the examples of good and bad and the results of each's actions. The good souls are portrayed by Maureen O'Hara and Leslie Howard. Maureen as Scarlett's sister rarely does any wrong and Howard's character continually fight's off his temptations, but the other main characters do very little right. With so much sadness in this movie it's amazing it is so well liked. I believe the deeper meaning comes thru and people cling to that as I did while viewing this very uniquely filmed movie which does some amazing things with shadows with the cinematography overall being excellent. Despite the long length of the movie it keeps your interest, but I believe it would be a hard movie to watch more than once...I'm glad I gave it the once, and I understand why the movie was so critically acclaimed.",

The only issue I have with this film is the portrayal of post war reconstruction with all the central figures of the story emerging after the war as prosperous businessmen-please! But then again that's not what Hollywood's all about,is it? Still a very powerful and relevant film. And while I'll admit that Miss Scarlet is a completely despicable character, no one can question her strength and spirit as she grows from spoiled a and sheltered socialite, to survivor, warrior, and cold hearted mercenary.

It's one of those 'emperor's new clothes' movies (""Citizen Kane"" being another prime example) which has created its own myth and which it seems to have become almost blasphemous to criticise. Call me a Philistine if you like, but to call this load of old toffee the greatest movie of all time - or even one of the greatest - is just plain rubbish. It may have been okay in its day, but now it's just so dated.

It tells a wonderful story, and it does a great job on representing important aspects of the Old South before, during, and after the Civil War. Throughout the movie, it shows the emotions and struggles people in the South went through during and after the war. In addition, Vivien Leigh did an amazing job at playing the role of Scarlett, a girl who clearly enjoys being the one in control and would do anything to achieve what she wants. And although the kind of woman Scarlett represents is very similar to the flappers during the Depression, she plays an important role in the story and creates a feeling of suspense since the viewers never know what else is she going to come up with next. On the other side, Olivia De Havilland played the role of Melanie perfectly well. Scarlett and Melanie are complete opposites and it is so great seeing them both together; Scarlett being her typical self, while Melanie is always there to support her no matter how arrogant Scarlett can get. They create great balance when it comes to the characters in the movie. ",

Because this film is still quite cardboard when it comes to acting and as some other people noted in here, this is really just a four hour episode of The Young and the Restless.  But then I also had to realize how the film made me feel.  And I did get through all 3 hours and 52 minutes of it, and that is an accomplishment in itself.  The first time I saw Citizen Kane, I fell asleep, the second time I saw Citizen Kane I wanted to smash the T.V. But Gone With The Wind is quite good, for this day and age or for the 30's or 40's.

It's simply a masterpiece and probably one of the greatest movie of all time. It's hard to explain why it's so good... It just is. Everything is just perfect from Vivien Leigh's excellent performance to Clark Gable's.

I dare anybody not to enjoy the super saga of that ding-dong daddy and a Southern belle. If Clark Gable had not accepted the role of Rhett Butler, this expensive production probably would not have been made. There are plenty of scenes to be had, but my favorite is Rhett's rescue of Scarlett while she's trying to maintain control of a wagon while a high-strung horsie tries to get away, and that's while Atlanta is burning to cinders (having been set on fire by Union troops under orders by General William Tecumseh Sherman). The relationship of Scarlett and Rhett lasts in the aftermath of the Civil War, including their tempestuous marriage and breakup. Rhett Butler loves Scarlett O'Hara, but she still has it bad for Ashley Wilkes, but he's in love with Melanie Hamilton (and they get married, by the way). It reminds this viewer of the rock hit by the J. Geils Band, ""Love Stinks"", where part of the lyrics go ""you love her, she loves him, he loves somebody else, you just can't win"". GONE WITH THE WIND is certainly the greatest example of storytelling ever conceived. Sidney Howard wrote the screenplay, based on the novel by Margaret Mitchell; she never wrote another one before her untimely death in 1949; it fell to Alexandra Ripley to gin up the sequel novel SCARLETT: THE OFFICIAL SEQUEL TO GONE WITH THE WIND, which itself was made as a miniseries. This movie is so beloved that for many years it escaped the ""late late show"" and the pay movie channels; it has since been shown on TNT and TCM. Did you know that a battlefield sequence had been filmed? That lovable producer David Selznick had the footage excised, because it was a love story, after all. Sidney Howard had uncredited assistance from the likes of Ben Hecht, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Oliver H.P. Garrett, John van Druten, Jo Swerlilng, and David Selznick himself. Did you also know that GONE WITH THE WIND was re-issued in 1967 in a 70mm widescreen presentation that lopped off the top and bottom of the film. One of the many Academy Award nominations was in the Special Effects category, for the spectacular visual effects accomplished by Jack Cosgrove and Lee Zavitz.If David Selznick never made another movie after GONE WITH THE WIND, this still would rank as his greatest achievement.

252,12 January 2005,ACitizenCalledKane,8, The film that set the standard for grandeur...,"David O. Selznick set out to make the biggest, and best, film that money could buy. The result is one of the biggest, most-successful, most critically acclaimed American films of all time - Gone With the Wind. Based on Margaret Mitchell's tale of long-lost southern gallantry, and a way of life that would never return, Gone With the Wind is a work of fiction, set in a glorified Technicolor rendition of the old south. Now, to say that this is all historically accurate would be like saying that this is a short film. Clocking in at just under four hours long, this story can be a little hard to sit through. You really have to get caught up in the soap opera. Once you do, however, it is not hard to see why this film is as highly regarded as it is. I can't help but feel that it is a little over-rated, but considering when it was made, it is spectacular. Vivien Leigh is extraordinary as the beautiful and manipulative Scarlett O'Hara. The intensity of each emotion she expresses throughout the film is outstanding! Clark Gable is the foil to Ms. Leigh's southern belle, the dashing, devil-may-care Rhett Butler. He is often very cool, allowing room for his bottled-up emotion to erupt. He spars with Scarlett, her intensity versus his calm resolve, but both characters are quite similar in many other ways...Leslie Howard is Ashley Wilkes, the physical embodiment of a southern gentleman. His wife, Melanie Hamilton, is played with a quiet grace all her own by Olivia de Havilland. Hattie McDaniel's Academy Award winning performance as Mammy, the voice of reason amongst all of the drama, is just as astounding as any of the other performances in this epic picture.

The struggle in the love relationship between Scarlett and Rhett begins when Scarlett is spurned by Ashley Wilkes, played by Leslie Howard, the man she set her sights on to marry. She finds out that he is to marry his cousin Melanie, played by Olivia de Havilland, and Scarlett does not respond well to his rejection. Scarlett is a spoiled belle used to getting her way and she doesn't realize that she and Ashley are not alone in the scene where he rejects her. Rhett is asleep on the couch and awakens when she throws a vase at the wall in anger. From here on, Rhett and Scarlett engage in a game of cat and mouse throughout the movie. There are not many other movies to compare this one to. The only one that I can say even compares would be North and South. It is set during the Civil War, just as Gone with the Wind is. North and South showcases a well-known actor, Patrick Swayze, who plays Orry Main, the main character in the movie. It is a love story that also shows the struggles in life and relationships that people faced during the Civil War, much like Gone with the Wind. I feel that Gone with the Wind is definitely the better movie. Although it came out in 1939, it was way ahead of its time. The way that Tara was portrayed as a mansion, with its expansive lands and cotton fields made me want to live there. The lighting that was used in scenes helped to convey the feeling of the characters. For example, when Scarlett and her sisters had to work the fields, the lighting was dark and dreary. It effectively conveyed the feeling of despair and helplessness that they were all feeling. Another thing I noticed was the camera angles. One particular scene which stuck in my mind was when Scarlett was in Atlanta. You can see the destruction across the city. There are bodies lined up in the streets. The camera pans out and in the corner you see the rebel flag flying. I think that seeing that the flag was still flying after such destruction and loss was amazing. Gone with the Wind is a timeless classic that reassures me that in the worst of times, people still find a way to fight for something they love.",

257,27 July 2011,FilmFanatic03,10, Perfect!,"This film is a true classic, all ages and all generations will love this cinematic masterpiece. Vivien Leigh really brought this film to life, portraying the complex character of Scarlett. You cannot define her character in one word. Her character can cause a lot of debate: Is she good or just plain selfish and cruel. Well, she's a bit of both but I would argue that at the end of the day she is a good person, who only knows a certain way of life which isn't exactly the right way but you see her growth in maturity and character throughout the film. There are moments when you realise that she has determination and strength to rise above situations and she really surprises you, in a good way, in certain ways which makes you grow respect for her character. You can't help but like her or be interested by her no matter what you think of her. Also, it would be wrong to not mention Clark Gables brilliant performance as Rhett Butler. He was so different from the ""gentlemen"" that in those days was of the norm, but the chemistry between Scarlett and Rhett was perfect, totally convincing and brilliant to watch. But the whole casting was spot on, every character was interesting and likable and all gave everything into their characters. Even in the 21st Centuray it is still considered a masterpiece and watching it, you don't feel such a huge gap in years. You can still watch it today and thoroughly enjoy it. You have to watch this film, it's a must see!",

261,11 April 2007,lauraeileen894,8, Masterful epic,"I didn't see ""Gone with the Wind"" until about 3 years ago, mainly because its four hour length was rather intimidating. However, I'm glad I did, because aside from its magnificent story and cinematography, ideal cast and fine direction, ""GwtW"" is one of the best paced films of all time, and the four hours really soar by. Of course, in order to enjoy ""GwtW"", you have to put aside your politically correct sensibilities. It's sexist in parts, historically biased (the North is the enemy, plain and simple) and terribly, terribly racist (the Georgia slaves seem perfectly content with their situation). Once you overlook these un-PC details, you'll fall in love with the ageless story of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), a bratty Southern belle who is shaken out of her complacency when the Civil War strikes. Leigh masterfully brings Scarlett to life, and you forgive the fact that she's much too pretty for the role (Margaret Mitchell bluntly described our heroine as ""not beautiful""). She seamlessly portrays Scarlett's imperfect charm and resourcefulness as well as her fiery temper and complete lack of scruples. We object to some of the things Scarlett does in her quest for survival (stealing her sister's fiancée, for instance), and yet, we'd secretly love to be that single-minded, determined, and unconcerned with basic social standards. Equally strong is the supporting cast: Hattie McDaniel won an Oscar (being the first black performer to do so) as fiercely devoted and no-nonsense Mammy, one of the few people who refuses to take any crap from Scarlett. Olivia de Havilland has the difficult task of playing the relentlessly noble and saintly Melanie, but fortunately she plays the character with genuine emotion and dignity, and never allows Melanie to become phony or saccharine. Leslie Howard, on the other hand, is extremely weak as everyone's least favorite character, the spineless and fatuous Ashley Wilkes, who, for some reason, Scarlett foolishly carries a torch for. The standout, however, is Clark Gable as sexy scoundrel Rhett Butler. A decidedly amoral iconoclast, Rhett proves himself to be Scarlett's soul mate, but, alas, she is too stubborn and blind to realize it. Gable plays the part with devil-may-care suaveness and barely contained passion, and was unfairly overlooked at Oscar time. The epic to end all epics, ""GwtW"" is a must for every film lover. You may love it, you may hate it... but you certainly won't forget it.",

Sidney Howard's screen adaptation expertly distilled Margaret Mitchell's rambling, compulsively readable novel into a concise 3 hour, 40 minute running time that amazingly captured all of the novel's dramatic high points. ""Gone with The Wind"" is obviously the reel version of the American Civil War as opposed to the real thing but as entertainment it is an unparalleled achievement in cinematic storytelling.

264,20 October 2020,Narniatonto,9, The cause of living in the past is dying right in front of us.,"In an examination of the United States following the Civil War, Gone with the Wind explores how different walks of life were affected, focusing on the lives of plantation-owners as they adjust to a world without slavery. Victor Fleming's 1939 classic follows capricious Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara as she navigates her life and relationships during the Civil War and subsequent Reconstruction. Scarlett insinuates herself in the lives of several men throughout this time, including the honorable and earnest Ashley Wilkes, the respectable Frank Kennedy, and the charismatic, wealthy and dishonest Rhett Butler. Scarlett ruins her marriages with Frank and Rhett due to her unrequited love for Ashley. Scarlett clings onto the Confederate South - clings onto Ashley - as her world is upended. The war leaves Tara, the O'Hara plantation, in shambles, and the family itself disoriented and stricken with poverty. The film is - on its surface - a tale of survival in the face of difficulty and uncertainty. Gone with the Wind is no stranger to censure; the film has long been criticized for its alleged romanticization of the antebellum South. After all, the film takes a look at the Civil War and Reconstruction through the lens of an affluent family in the South who has slavery to thank for their riches. But even though Scarlett is the protagonist, she is not meant to be seen as likable and only sympathetic to an extent.",
265,21 June 2005,silverscreen888,8, Physically Breathtaking; a Seminal Epic; Admirable and Admired,"This epic film has been written about for decades; but what needs to be said about it has, perhaps, never been addressed. It is a very entertaining, well-photographed and generally well-acted historical work. The music by Max Steiner, the great scenes such as Scarlett O'Hara's descent into chaos as she seeks a doctor during the battle for Atlanta, the ball, the party at Twelve Oaks, the burning of Atlanta fight scene, and others have never been surpassed. But despite David O. Selznick's vast exertions with writer Sidney Howard and others to bring Margaret Mitchell's novel to the screen, some script problems were never solved. The film is in fact I assert a partially-completed allegory. Scarlett O' Hara, played by British Vivien Leigh represents southern womanhood wanting to live an American, a full life; her erstwhile love, Ashley Wilkes, played by Brit Leslie Howard, represents the Old South--which is why he could never find a handle on the motivations of his character. Scarlett was given straightforward actions; he was given several contradictory decisions to resolve. But the great triumphs of the film as Ayn Rand pointed out are that it involves all levels of the society in the great changes brought about by the Civil War, and its aftermath; and the other is that the use of observers as ""norms"" of the Southern viewpoint in so many scenes allows the viewer to understand both those who challenge and those who defend the Old South's ideas and practices. Every element of this huge cinematic 1939 production works beautifully. The actors, challenged by the style and scope of the script, who did very well include Leigh as Scarlett, Barbara O'Neill and Thomas Mitchell as her parents, Olivia de Havilland and Hattie McDaniel, Carroll Nye, Alicia Rhett, Victor Jory, Butterfly McQueen, Rand Brooks and dozen of others from Everett Brown as Big Sam to the most minor of roles. Clark Gable brings off Rhett Butler, but lacks classical speech training to complete a difficult role. Mention should be made of several others for their for their creative contributions including directors Sam Wood, Victor Fleming and George Cukor, production designer William Cameron Menzies, Walter Plunkett's costumes, Sydney Guilaroff's hairstylings and Lyle Wheeler's art direction.Whatever few questions one has about Ashley Wilkes' character, there is so much here that is outstanding here that this is a film for the ages in every sense, beautiful to watch and hard-to-forget.",

267,21 July 2008,cornel1801,10," Why ""Gone with the wind"" is so good?","Why ""Gone with the wind"" is it so good? Maybe because it encompasses all the states of human soul: love and hate, happiness and pain, tenacity and weakness, enthusiasm and disappointment, compassion and indifference, honor and dishonor, sincerity and hypocrisy, wealth and poverty, ability and inability, courage and fear, desperation and hope. And the series could continue. A series as complex as human existence. A movie of success and fails. A movie from which everyone can choose their own way forward in life. A movie of search and self-knowledge. A movie about the mystery of life and death that trying to understand. And believe me. A movie like that will no longer do. Many see and like what they see, little think and even fewer say it. Margaret Mitchell, the novel writer, was one of the very few. If you are one of those few who really ask questions about the meaning of existence, review the film and I am sure you will find the answer to your question. Fortunately for humanity and the human race, most people are mere transmitters of genetic information. I recently reviewed, in order not to know how many times, every time with several years added to the thread of my life, this masterpiece that is not only a great film.

We know that this is about to change dramatically and a case could be made that we don't need three and three quarter hours to illustrate it. Okay, I'm oversimplifying and it is a rich tapestry that is weaved for us though most of the striking visuals - two black children (they would, at the time, have been called pickaninnies)playing happily in cartwheels, silhouettes on a horizon at sundown, the pan across the wounded at and the burning of Atlanta etc - occur in the first half.

292,3 May 2006,chrisbishop5000,2, Hollywood's most loved film - but what in God's name is there to love?!!!,"Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara who is powerful, sometimes nasty, and beautiful and that matches perfectly with Clark Gable who plays the muscular, arrogant and seductive Rhett Butler who is handsome. Many of the film's characters are horribly arrogant in their own ways and that is one of the things I hate about this long, lifeless movie. Other bad points are that the film's storyline is so hard to understand, Scarlett and Rhett hardly ever get on, Rhett getting drunk so many times annoys the life out of me, all the nice characters die - like Melanie and Scalett's mother and so on, Scarlett suspects rivalry with Melanie over Ashley Wilkes who is dull and even just that little bit unattractive and I would expect someone like Scarlett to have a crush on strapping young men who have nice looks. Some scenes he looks better than others. I don't see what people love about this movie - it drags, its drama is extremely heavy, there is hardly any romance instead there's constant rowing and that doesn't create much of a love-story I don't think. It's on for 4 hours so I believe and to most people, ""Gone with the Wind"" would seem like 4 hours of romance, action, melodrama, difficult situations, stunning fire effects for Atlanta in flames - it's got the lot some may say, but I personally think that I can be so boring throughout most of its 4 hours. Very soon, in a couple of days or so I hope, my mum will watch it with me (I've got it on video and 4-disc DVD) and help me to get to know it better meaning she will hopefully help me understand the story and, who knows? I may grow quite fond of it. I do like the scene when Scarlett is forced to nurse a pregnant Melanie who is also very poorly and Prissy lies about being good at helping to drop babies she gets hit when she is caught out. I love the scene when Scarlett and Rhett take Melanie, her newborn baby and Prissy back to Tara and the fiery backdrop. It's not the best film I've ever seen I can tell you. I did watch it with mum and I did start to understand the story a bit better but I still find it rather uninteresting and irritating there really are so many things about it that irritate me arrgghh! - you wouldn't believe it! Oh, and by the way, as big, sometimes bullying and rather offencive Rhett Butler is (to all except little Bonnie who he spends his life and money around) Clark Gable was actually quite a wimp in reality and I found that out on the special 4-DVD box set. I'm not surprised he wanted to turn down the role of Rhett Butler he looks like such a twit but, I suppose, he did his best and nobody can do better than their best. Vivien Leigh looks like she's getting rather overexcited as Scarlett and not thinking about the proper character of Miss O'Hara mind you she is rather a gorgeous girl and I can see why Rhett was so jealous of the unattractive Ashley Wilkes. If you can endure people who always shout in a very grating way whenever they open their mouths ALL THE TIME instead of just talking like normal people do, seeing beautiful but abrupt Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara suspecting rivalry with a sweet-natured young lady over an ugly old man, Scarlett and Rhett's love affair lasting about a mere 10 minutes throughout a massive 4 hours, kind-hearted characters dying every two minutes at the end, seeing drunken Rhett trying to attack Scarlett and then take her daughter from her the very next morning then you are probably very likely to love GONE WITH THE WIND but if not then don't bother.",
293,15 April 2008,HelloTexas11,7, the ultimate chick flick?,"So what can you say about 'Gone With The Wind' that hasn't blah blah blah... I don't know for certain, but I'll try. How about it's the grandmama (as opposed to granddaddy) of all chick flicks? I think it is. I watched it for the first time in years the other night and although it's still terribly familiar, I was able to pick up on some things with a fresh perspective. I've never understood why Scarlett O'Hara is considered in some circles to be an 'admirable' character. Maybe 'enviable' because of her gorgeous appearance, which is how most of the other females in the film seem to feel about her. But she's spoiled rotten, enjoys being spoiled rotten, and apparently her sole ambition in life is to go on being spoiled rotten. The admirable things she does at various points in the movie- shooting a marauding soldier, delivering a baby- she only does because she absolutely has to, and she hates having to do them. Or, to put it another way, Scarlett only does them because she can't be bothered with the alternative. Make no mistake, she is a fascinating character and Vivien Leigh is cast to perfection as her, but it's frightening to think a couple of generations of girls might have considered her a role model of sorts. There is an intrinsic dopiness to 'Gone With The Wind' that all the wonderful sets and beautiful costumes can't conceal. In fact, sometimes those costumes seem to be more what the film's about than the story itself. The film is a Selznick Production, but it has the look and feel of a top-shelf MGM flick. And as with every major MGM production of the time, there has to be an overriding theme, a heavy-handed moral to be taken from the film, and in this case, it is that Scarlett learns to love the land as her father did. Which she does. But nobody buys it, in fact her final words are barely remembered. Most people think, ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" is the last line in the movie. Just like most people remember the green dress above everything else. There are some undeniably powerful scenes in 'Gone With The Wind' (at over three and a half hours, there had better be) and some funny ones, and Clark Gable is perfect too as Rhett Butler, rogue, reprobate, and all-around Southern Cavalier. To me, one frustrating aspect of his character, or I should say everyone's reaction to his character, is that he is forever speaking blunt truths and common sense and nobody seems to hear him. Certainly Scarlett doesn't. Likewise, his warnings early on about the South's chances in the upcoming Civil War go unheeded. One wonders why he hangs around with people who treat him like a cad, a liar, a man with no honor when he's actually the most honorable person in the movie, with the possible exception of Melanie Hamilton. Now there's a ingeniously thought out character- Melanie. She provides poetic justice for Scarlett. Nothing Scarlett says can rile her; in fact she takes every hateful, venomous uttering from Scarlett and turns it around into something wonderful. It is almost a running gag that the meaner Scarlett is to Melanie, the more forgiving and admiring Melanie becomes of Scarlett. The scenes of death and destruction in Atlanta are memorable, including the famous long shot of the dead and wounded soldiers lying in the main street. The torturous soap opera that makes up the second half of the film will see male viewers rapidly losing interest, as it begins to resemble a 1930's version of 'Dynasty.' Even Rhett Butler's character lacks purpose for a long stretch, and his increasingly pointless upbraiding of Scarlett and her shortcomings becomes tiresome. She will never change and he begins to look foolish in thinking anything he says will make a difference.",
294,10 February 2023,LadyKanerasoka,9, Instant Classic About the Brutality of War,"This film is an amazing instant classic that has stood the test of time, even after nearly a century later and the visuals, costumes, EVERYTHING! Are completely stunning. It's an amazingly beautiful but at the same time extremely brutal story about a young southern Belle who comes into womanhood and struggles to survive as the Civil War ravages and destroys her southern home of Georgia and deals with the perils and challenges of famine, jealousy, heartbreak, love, and more. But be aware that despite the film's G rating, it is by no means a family friendly film by today's standards! It's at best PG due to frightening situations (many of which involve guns and/or cannons), a few scenes containing blood (though the amount of blood shown isn't too extreme), and many disturbing scenes involving during and post-warfare such as wounded soldiers begging for help, houses burned to the ground and/or looted clean, people running away from nonstop cannon fire in terror, and more. But there's also a few good messages too: no matter how hard things get, never stop fighting to survive. I also like how it shows that the southern states in the Civil War suffered too and that everything wasn't as black-and-white as you might think it would be. But when watching this film, set aside A LOT OF TIME considering this film is over FOUR HOURS LONG!!!",
295,2 January 2017,annavernick-34195,10, Loved this movie!!,"When I first got this movie, I was a bit skeptical. I'm not a huge fan of war based movies, but I was pleasantly surprised. Gone With the Wind was a beautiful movie that so clearly showed the devastation of the Civil War and how during the Reconstruction the Southerners had to adjust to the abolishment of slavery. Although there are racist undertones and many of the African American characters are stereotypes, one has to take into account the time the movie was filmed and released, and the time it is depicting. The romance element of the movie helps keep it interesting, and the movie perfectly balances romance and the Civil War aspects of the film. All in all, this movie was amazing and I can see how it is one of the greats.",

Had tried a couple of times before without success. Afterward we had a big argument about it of course--she was stuck on the hopeless romanticism of the thing which I saw as Grand Ole Soap Opry. Not to mention the simple fact that whether you like it or not, both book and movie glorify the most degrading and longest-lasting oppression visited by one people upon another since The Grandeur That Was Rome. Imagine this story in a more modern context, with Scahlett and her precious crew as Germans in the 1930s and Mammy and her folk as Jews. Somehow I doubt such a movie would've been made. I will allow that the movie unintentionally provides an accurate barometer of the pathetic state of race relations (non-relations?) in pre-WWII America.",

While GWTW clocks in at about 4 hours in length, the movie necessarily leaves out many characters (Dilcie, Uncle Henry Hamilton, Will Benteen, Wade & Ella-Scarlett's first two children) who were important in the book.

But the actress plays the role of Scarlett perfectly and outwardly I imagined her that way. The film is certainly shot amazingly, but after the book there were completely different emotions. But it's very interesting to watch and compare the script with the story in the book. Despite some disadvantages, this film is a world classic and is a masterpiece of cinema.

Filmed at Selznick International studios ( now best known as Desilu Culver), the film reflects film making at its best. David Selznick drove himself and most people around him relentlessly until he got the correct cast. It would have been easy to get Errol Flynn and Bette Davis and indeed Warners offered Selznick a better deal financially but he remained steadfast in his efforts to get Clark Gable as Rhett Butler and due to that fact Selznick International had to release the film via MGM Gable's studio Legendary actresses such as Jean Arthur, Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Norma Shearer, Lucille Ball and then newcomers Susan Hayward and Lana Turner all were considered. Paulette Goddard almost had the part. Selznick was up against a filming schedule that he had to go with the picture and lo and behold Scarlett O Hara in the vision of Vivien Leigh appeared. We can all thank Selznick for his steadfastness in wanting the picture cast correctly. The supporting players such as Olivia De Havilland, Leslie Howard and most definitely Hattie McDaniel give an added thrust to the emotions of the picture. The sets, the camera work, the costumes (Selznick wrote tons of memos about Clark Gable's outfits), all resulted in a movie masterpiece. The windup of the movie was all Selznick's doing especially Scarlett hearing the voices of her past before her legendary "" After All Tomorrow Is Another Day"".",

Get your favorite snack and drink, pop in the dvd and just enjoy.  At almost 4 hours long, rarely does this classic drag. It is an engrossing antebellum soap opera that exceeds the novel in drama and scope and excellence (a rarity).  So much has been said of this movie that accolades from me would just be piling on.  Suffice to say, the production values are beyond top notch.  You actually are viewing 1860's Carolina and Georgia.  The acting is so good, the actors were type cast for years after. Specifically, Vivian Leigh never ever got past the Scarlett O'hara character with the possible exception of Streetcar.  The film won 10 Oscars and rightly so.  This in what had to be the toughest competitive year ever -- 1939.  For those Widescreen buffs (me included), note the dvd is only in fullscreen simply because that is the original format.

All of the other movies I mentioned here (as well a couple more) were nominated for Best Picture of 1939, and I have seen each of them (except ""Ninotchka""). ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" told a heartfelt tale of an educator and the lives he touched during his tenure at a boys' school. ""Wuthering Heights"" was a sweeping romance with a memorable performance by Sir Laurence Olivier. ""Stagecoach"" had action and thrills under the deft direction of John Ford, while becoming a star-maker for a man known as The Duke. And ""The Wizard of Oz"" is quite possibly the most magical film of all time, immortalizing Judy Garland as the young Dorothy Gale and influencing nearly every fantasy film made ever since.

I like that it makes it well known that neither Scarlett nor Rhett are great people. When they make mistakes, the movie never condones it or excuses it. That is why when Rhett forces himself on Scarlett, it never really bothered me like it did so many others. And as for the so-called racist undertones, I feel that the harsh criticisms are slightly unfair, because not only does the movie accurately represent the sentiments that whites had towards blacks during the Civil War era, but it also led to the first Oscar given to an African American (Hattie McDaniel) and shows how far we have come as a society. I also enjoy the war aspect of the film. The conflict sets the tone for the relationship between Scarlett and Rhett, which is just as turbulent as the one between the Union and the Confederates. And lastly, the cinematography is some of the most beautiful that I have ever seen. The scene where they are escaping from Atlanta has some of the brightest colors in any movie, They even managed to make a burning city hauntingly beautiful.

Secondly, the story is truly memorable with characters that have become immortalized, and even a part of American popular culture, such as Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Mammy, and Prissy. Thirdly, the acting is truly excellent! In a wonderful cast, Vivien Leigh must be singled out for special praise. Scarlett O'Hara was probably the most sought after movie part in history-- and it went to an unknown British actress! The casting was a risk. Considering the chaos the was the actual filming of GWTW--changing directors three times-- the artistry of the picture must be credited to David O Selznick, the producer, and to Vivien Leigh for her determined, willful, charming ,manipulating,selfish, but decent Southern Belle who is the very definition of a survivor.

For example, in the book, we see that Scarlett had children after her two marriages, but in the movie, it is not shown. Nevertheless, it doesn't change the main idea of the story. Also, I want to state that the actors of this movie perfectly show the characters of the heroes. I really saw the characteristic of Scarlett in Vivien Leigh's play and of course the same thing I can say about Rett's actor. Thus, overall I think that this movie is one of the greatest movies in the world.",
335,20 August 2002,dieusani,10, A true classic,"""Gone With the Wind"" is one of those films that I've had recommended to me for most of my life, but had never actually gotten around to seeing...until recently.  Let me establish that I am not, by any means, a romantic guy. Unquestionably, the genre this film would be placed in is that of Romance, or possibly Romantic Drama if you want to be really specific.  But...in another review (Star Wars Episode II) I mentioned films that rise above their genre and become something more, something nearly everyone can enjoy. ""Gone With the Wind"" is one of those films. The story surrounds Scarlet O'Hara, and her struggle to survive and regain the style of life that the Civil War took from her.  She starts out as a manipulative, largely false and uncaring young woman, whose only real care in life is to get her way.  She is ""in love"" with Ashley Wilkes, largely, in my opinion, because she can't have him.  Ashley is a nice enough man, but he certainly isn't the type for Scarlet.  In the beginning of the film, the characters are nicely established.  The acting is top-notch, the writing is excellent, and this is one of those films you just have to see to believe. This is another of those films that I really can't comment on too much without giving away parts of the plot, so at this point I'd advise you to stop reading if you don't want to risk having something given away to you. SPOILER WARNING. Now, my philosophy on the film--you aren't supposed to like Scarlet.  She is manipulative.  She is shallow.  She rarely shows compassion for others unless it will get her something in return.  She lures two prospective husbands away from other girls via lies and false affection (not that the men aren't partially at fault there) and then basically makes the men miserable for what little time they live afterwards.  That's simply the way she is for most of the film--a person who uses the misery of others, from slaves to prisoners to her husbands, to enhance her own life.  Ashley says it himself in the later parts of the film, commenting that her use of prisoners in her business is wrong, that she should hire people (and, incidentally, that he'd intended to free his family's slaves when his father died and they became his, if the war hadn't done it first).  Her entire life is focused around getting something she cannot have--Ashley Wilkes.  He is husband to Melanie (who is, incidentally, a sweet and kind woman who sacrifices herself for everyone else, and eventually dies because she gave too much of herself).  Scarlet is living in a fantasy world, where everything revolves around her, and refuses to accept that things will not go her way.  In the middle of the film, this gives her strength, and allows people to survive...but once her home is safe, she becomes unbearable again. She never changes, never realizes that the needs of other people matter too.  Even poor Rhett (who, to be fair, is quite the manipulative and false man himself, and is certainly not without fault) is manipulated by her, constantly pushed aside despite doing everything he can to show her his love, until finally his heart is broken and he can take no more.  The end of the film, where Scarlet finally turns to Rhett after Ashley finally musters up the will to tell her ""no"" for good, isn't uplifting...""Tommorrow is another day"" isn't hopeful.  It's tragic.  Scarlet still cannot accept the loss of something she wanted.  Rhett will never return to her, because she's caused him too much pain, but she will keep on trying, manipulating people, because she is still unable to let other people's needs go ahead of her own. Maybe it's just my way of seeing it (I /have/ been told that I ""missed the point,"" that somehow Scarlet's manipulation should be accepted because it is a search for security--I feel that's a reason, but not an excuse)...but in any case, I immensely enjoyed ""Gone With the Wind,"" despite hating Scarlet, and any movie that can inspire me to write for this long on just one of its many characters and points, on just a small part of the film, is certainly worth a look.  Watch and enjoy.",

I Don't need to sit for 4 hours watching someone complain, say and do horrible things to people. Even if the lead protagonist has an ark, it only really matters by the end.

Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara, and she is the only actress that could play this part, she was one of the most gorgeous women of her time. Clark Gable is not too shabby himself, he is near perfect as Rhett Butler. The romance between Scarlett and Rhett is red hot, and when they get snippy with each other, they sizzle with hatred and smoldering intensity. This is one film everyone and I MEAN everyone must see in his or her lifetime. The score is dramatic and full of life, the acting is absolutely astounding, and the story is pure magic.

As time passes by, I cannot see any movie equaling its beauty and charm. Again one must consider cinema was still in its infancy in 1939. I remember the 50th anniversary release in 1989 having to queue for over 3 hours to see it. Was it worth it ? You bet it was. There has been too much negative reviews over the years regarding the wooden acting, soppy story line, but does ""Titanic"" fare any better ?.

Be so for real with me right now! The whole love triangle thing was so lame and this movie really took away from what the time period was all about, the civil war. Also I hated Ashley! Bro literally married his cousin... Anyway I still really love this movie despite how long it was and how inaccurate it is historically.

This film is awash, as one would expect, in nostalgia for the ancien regime, and not even the charm of Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable can make me forget that fact. Such scenes as the one in which the director has an African-American character riding along in a carriage singing Marching Through Georgia are obviously meant to inspire bitterness and resentment in the viewer, and the Federal troops are uniformly portrayed as brutes. This is nothing but polite version of Birth of a Nation--at least so far as its politics go.",
346,12 March 2014,SaveFerris97,9, A must-see,"Gone with the Wind (1939, George Cusak, Victor Fleming, Sam Wood) is a perfect adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's famous novel of the same name. Scarlett and Rhett's twisted romance rising and falling takes place in the heart of a war where any and every win from either side is a Pyrrhic victory, and the groundbreaking use of color was just in time to improve an already beautiful film. I can only assume that without color, this film would be lessened, but still a wonderful depiction of what Mitchell created. This alluring and headstrong woman represents the sheer will of the Southern states in the tumultuous Civil War, and her stubbornness, like the South's, leads to her ultimate failure in achieving happiness. The shots, specifically the extremely wide ones such as the scene where Scarlett is picking her way through the crowd of bodies that embody the dying of the old South, are very interesting to look for. The lighting is normally very bright, and in the scene where Rhett is assisting Scarlett, Melanie, her baby, and Prissy to flee the burning Atlanta, it is so bright and warm that it truly does look like their little Southern world is ablaze. The use of shadows and silhouettes is also very interesting. Several shots in scenes set at Tara, Scarlett's childhood home, often use wide shots that do not completely articulate the in-shot characters' features. Instead, they capture their silhouettes. As for design and costuming, the steady decline in the elegance of living conditions and clothing perfectly exemplifies the fall of class and grace at that time. In my opinion, Gone with the Wind is an absolute must-see. However, I highly recommend reading the book first, as it makes the photography of the film easier to appreciate.",

And of course there is Mammy. The cinematography and vibrant colors are also breathtaking to behold. I can also appreciate the ambition and the scope of the picture and how it holds up perfectly today. I haven't read Margret Mithcell's book but I think I read somewhere that there is at least one major difference between the film and the book. In the film a black laborer saves Scarlett from being raped by a white hoodlum but in the book the ethnicity of assailant and savior are reversed. I don't know if this change was made for political reasons. I rate this movie 8/10. In my humble opinion it is not superior to Casablanca or Citizen Kane.

She's obsessed with a man who doesn't want her, and hurts others just to get close to him. Men who loved her she used to get ahead, and even died for her and she didn't care. She was never strong in times of crises, and only survived because she found someone new to feel sorry for her. Her character portrayed the worst parts of our humanity, and I had to endure it being allowed for over 3 hours. I think it would have been acceptable still if some how she redeemed herself in the end, but instead she just went to the ""somehow things will fix itself"" quality and the story ends.

You read about her love for her frail, fair-haired neighbor who was too intellectual for his own good; and about the dark, swarthy visitor from Charleston with large dark eyes and a cocky smile. Then, lo and behold, Hollywood bought the rights to the film and generated more publicity than humanly possible about their search for the perfect Scarlett O'Hara.

Without comparing it to any other of the landmark films in studio history, which like this one, almost always seem to be gloriously overblown quasi-historical romantic melodramatic epics (i.e. ""Birth of a Nation"" or eckkkk ""Titanic""), as it is, this is a monstrously schizophrenic mess of a movie (which I suspect has to do with switching directors in mid-production).  Everything is over the top and over reaching and over long, but I'll be damned if it isn't entertaining every bit of the way throughout its engaging four hours.  This is the ultimate example of how powerful the studio machine was in the heyday of Hollywood, in that it could turn an overblown, overbudget heap of celluloid into an ""event"" that still stands the test of time as a testament to possibilities of movies as an art form.",

They cheered at the opening titles; they cheered at each of the 4 main character's intro scene; the 'scandalous' waltz; Melanie & Ashley's (cliched)reunion; Gable's return after a lengthy hiatus; Scarlett's smitten 'morning after' reaction to Rhett's drunken seduction (an especially loud cheer as Leigh awakens, then stretches and purrs with guilty satisfaction; it's hysterical!!), Rhett's exit line; and on and on...and on. The audience's reaction was contagious and their (my) attitude toward the film was treated with equal camp and respect. Ya just don't get that much fun at the movies with regular movie goers at regular theaters (unfortunately). 25 years later when the movie was restored and rereleased at the theaters (98 or 99), it played at some colleges and the reaction was...the same.

So I say leave it alone it's a great film that's a part of cinematic history which portrays another darker period in history, all I can say to those who would ban this film is leave it alone it has its place in history just as the slavery depicted in the film has its place in history, so learn from it, that's what history does, it teaches those that come after what happened that's all no morality or this is good or that's bad that's for the people who study or just look back on history, all anyone can do today is learn from it but leave it intact for those that come after you so they can learn.",

A movie that has stood the test of time to prove that there are still people out there, normally perfectly reasonable people, that believe that a disgusting, repulsive, and manipulative woman such as our protagonist is a ""model of feminism"". Throughout this Civil War epic, we are treated to a glimpse into the life of ""Southern Belle"" Miss Scarlett O'Hara. A four hour glimpse, but a glimpse, nonetheless. Throughout this tale of love and passion, we watch our leading lady, played magnificently by Vivien Leigh, lust after a boyish man called Ashley. Miss Scarlett pleads, and begs, and manipulates herself into the arms of her love Ashley. But Ashley wants to marry Melanie, a character with so little emotion you would think she's a recovering crystal meth addict. Soon, the Yankee rascals attack Scarlett's simple home, a lavish mansion full to the brim with slaves who ""just want the best for the white folk."" Scarlett is forced on the road,where she takes refuge in Atlanta, which is then burnt to the ground. Scarlett meets Rhett Butler, a gentlemen pimp who runs a seemingly very successful brothel. They hit it off, but Scarlett still wants the now married Ashley. So, when the time is right, as the wife Melanie lies dying in the other room, Scarlett pounces on the grieving Ashley. What better time to seduce a young man than when his wife is near death next door? Well, that doesn't work for our model heroine, so she falls into the arms of Mr. Butler, where they proceed with a passionate love affair that ends with rape, pregnancy, death of the child, and Mr. Butler getting so fed up with his filthy wife that he leaves her. That ends our movie. Four hours after it started. And what better quote to end the movie than the awful ""For tomorrow's a new day!"" in regards to Scarlett having to rush to the train station to win back her turned off husband, the pimp, but being just a tad bit to late. Which means she never leaves the mansion. It is worth mentioning two characters: Mammy and Prissy. Mammy is actually a pretty fine woman, but Prissy, oh Prissy!

374,5 February 2013,inkblot11,7," No one needs another review of this film but, as a film lover, I've never really cared for it","Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) is a 16 year old headstrong Southern belle just before the civil war. At every picnic and gathering of folks near her father's plantation in Georgia, our Miss O'Hara is knee deep in admiring men, for she is beautiful and saucy. Unhappily for her, however, the one gentleman she really has eyes for, Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), doesn't seem to be interested in becoming a suitor, although he considers her a friend. This is because, after tradition, Ashley has been ""promised"" for a long time to his distant cousin, Melanie (Olivia DeHavilland). Being a bold lady, Scarlett tries to court HIM, when she is supposed to be napping before a ball. He turns her down, reluctantly and leaves the room. Scarlett throws a fit and a piece of china and narrowly misses another man, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable). From that moment, Mr. Butler has admiration for Scarlett, for he has defied a few conventions himself. Stung from Ashley's rejection, Scarlett marries Melanie's brother in haste, for the war has just started and he must leave to fight. Through the war, Scarlett and Melanie live together in Atlanta and when Sherman comes marching, Rhett rescues the ladies and actually declares his love for Scarlett, before leaving her on the road home, as he is enlisting, finally. She is as mad as a hatter, both from his hot kisses and his abandonment. Yet, Miss O'Hara makes it home, keeps hold of the plantation through the reconstruction period and still harbors love for Mr. Wilkes. Yet, when Scarlett's second husband dies, she agrees to, at last, marry Rhett, for he is very rich. But, will it be love everlasting? Wait and see. First, let me state that I LOVE the book and got it as an eighth grade birthday present. It is one of the great love stories of all time, set in the South at a difficult point in history. But, I've never been overly fond of the movie. There are several reasons. The cast, while some call it a ""dream"", is merely good. Hattie McDaniel, who plays the faithful mammy of Scarlett, is my favorite while Leigh, Howard and DeHavilland are certainly fine. Gable is good, too, but he's not my idea of the perfect Rhett, though many others think so. I always wanted Burt Reynolds, in his ""Dan August"" heyday to star in a new version, for he was smoking hot. Obviously, this won't happen. But, while sets, costumes, and photography are nicely done, the script is overly melodramatic and maudlin, taking power away from the story, and the direction must be blamed, too. All in all, there are so many remakes of classics today, why doesn't someone give this one a modern take? But, it probably won't occur, for most film fans, unlike myself, consider this the classic of all classics and feel any new version would fall on its face.",

Scarlett's hopeless love for a married man makes this movie worthwhile. Four whole hours of Scarlett's fight for true love. Even though it's all about Scarlett O'Hara, it still gives appeal to life during the Civil War. Vivien Leigh portrayed Scarlett perfectly and really became Scarlett in this jaw dropping film.

401,16 February 2005,fondablaster,7," Great art + hateful characters = 65 years of debate, influence, misunderstanding and admiration","Finally, seeing the film the way it was meant to be seen (in the newly released and restored, theatrical-ratio, letter-boxed format, digital transfer 4-disc DVD set, {phew!}) showed me more than I bargained for. ""Gone with the Wind"" has been (immediately following its 1939 release) hailed as a classic. And it does have all the makings of a classic: Sprawling sets, beautiful cinematography, amazing music, brilliant directing and the desire of two studios working together to get the job done properly. No expense was spared (and it shows) in the making of the film, and the audience was given a true visual treat. The script was fine, as most of the dialog was verbatim from Margaret Mitchell's novel, and the actors read their lines and performed their scenes to the best of their ability (some obviously better than others). Unfortunately, the problems with the picture far out weigh the positives and it was the same problems that the novel had. The characters that these wonderful to mediocre actors play are despicable. The lot of them. Scarlett is the most hateful female character I have encountered, ever. She is petty, selfish, dishonest, she puts on airs even when she has no reason to, she is unfaithful to her family (marrying her sister's romantic interest - even if it was to save the estate), she is manipulative and generally just an out and out witch (choice of first letter optional). Likewise, and making the perfect couple from Hell, Rhett is a scoundrel; an abuser, a womanizer, a drunk and would turn sides against the North or the South or his own mother if it were to raise his bank account. Ashley is horrid; he is wishy-washy (especially for a soldier), unfaithful to his wife - who is also his cousin (if not in body, most certainly in mind), weak-willed and idiotic in his decision to go to Atlanta instead of New York (away from the evil and manipulative Scarlett). Even Melanie is unlikable; at the very least because of the blind faith she places in her husband and the unwarranted, misplaced trust she places in Scarlett, if not for the incestuous relationship with Ashley. And those are just the leads! The secondary characters are no better. Mammy is arrogant and often unnecessarily angry; Prissy is a liar and a dolt; Ellen O'Hara (Scarlett's mother) is cold, bitter, distant and unpleasant, Gerald O'Hara (the father) is stubborn and rigid, and later weak and detached. In fact the only truly pleasant characters are Big Sam who saves Scarlett from attackers (much to this viewer's disappointment) and the prostitute-with-the-heart-of-gold who gives Melanie money for the hospital and later safe-houses Ashley for Rhett. And all of the above (well, except maybe Mammy, Prissy and Big Sam) are all in support of the Old South. If these characters are not hateful for the above reasons given (which they are - at least by yours truly) then they must be condemned simply for holding dearly a philosophy which, not only accepted, but championed slavery, incest and war and put more stock in keeping up appearances as opposed to accepting reality. I am not hater of great art, and I know a good movie when I see it. I loved this film for the cinematic genius that it must have taken to produce it. But watching loathsome people for nearly four hours is a bit hard to stomach, regardless of the ingenuity and obvious skill provided on-set and behind the scenes. In other classic films like ""Citizen Kane"", ""Shadow Of A Doubt"", ""Casablanca"" and ""The Godfather"" (and more recently with ""Falling Down"", ""As Good As It Gets"", ""Fight Club"" and ""Pulp Fiction""), the audience is able to enjoy the viewing experience because even though the main protagonist is disliked, dreaded or despised, at least they remain sympathetic. I did not feel sorry for one character at one time during ""Gone with the Wind"". They all got what they deserved. Even Bonnie is better off dead than have to live with the soul-sucking Scarlett as her mother. So, my final review: 10 stars out of 10 for production, direction, cinematography, musical composition and performance and faithful adaptation of the novel; 8 out of 10 stars for acting (brought up 2 whole points - one each for Clark Gable and Olivia de Havilland, both of whom were remarkable, regardless of their awful characters); 2 out of 10 stars for the characters and story (these are terrible people from head to toe, from page to screen; people whom you would walk across the street to spit on, but a 1 out of 10 stars is a score reserved for films like ""Glitter"", ""Crossroads"" and ""You Got Served""); and my overall score (10+8+2 divided by 3) is 6.7 stars out of 10. This film is obviously worth seeing and (this new version is) probably worth owning, but worth loving? I'm not so sure.",

The jokes still work, the set decoration is good, the battle scenes and effects are still good (even nowadays and I didn't even watch the restored version from 1998), the film has a couple of great shots and a lot of diversity. But it is the effort and class of the two leading actors that make this film so good and worth while. Vivian Leigh is just perfect as the breathtaking and naive yet selfish and cruel Scarlett whereas Clark Gable pulls off the best ungentlemanly yet likeable money chaser I've ever seen.

Being able to see the effect that the American Civil War had on not only living during that time but also the way the films were being done. This war had a huge effect on the film as you watch it you get to see the way that the war has changed the lives of these Southerners. The film shows how life was before during and after the war for them. This amazing adaptation of the 1936 novel Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell tells the love story of Scarlett O'Hara. Living at her parents' plantation in Georgia, Scarlett learns about the engagement of Ashley and Melanie Hamilton. The next day at the Twelve Oaks party, despite warnings from her parents Scarlett reveals her feelings for Ashely, he refuses because of his love for his cousin Melanie Hamilton.

Vivien Leigh is perfect to bring out the stubbornness, strong-will, shrewdness and, needless to mention, gorgeous beauty of Scarlett. Her performance really lights up the whole movie.

When I finally saw it, years later, it was a colossal disappointment. When I was studying cinema I came across a survey by Sight and Sound, the magazine of the British Film Institute, asking critics around the world the nearly impossible question ""What are the best films ever made?"" or something to that effect.""Citizen Kane"" easily got over fifty votes while ""Gone With the Wind"" received only two, both from American critics by the way. In fact there were dozens of American films which ranked above it on the lists, so what happened? I'm suspecting the Selznik super-sell is responsible for the hype.

413,2 January 2017,klessar,7, A powerful movie about the hardships of Reconstruction and Civil War.,"Gone with the Wind is a classic Civil War movie that recognizes the of faults of the War. The protagonist of the Gone with the Wind is Scarlett, who struggles through the hardships of Reconstruction and the Civil War. Gone with the Wind shows the weaknesses and strengths of the struggles of Reconstruction and how life was to be lived during the Civil War.Scarlett can be described as determined as she drives to achieve everything she desires. Scarlett aims to win Ashley Wilkes, and her failure to do so guides the plot of the novel. Scarlett loses her true love, Rhett Butler, because of her persistent desire to win Ashley. Gone with the Wind is based in the South. The movie is very persistent in allowing the viewer(s) to know that the Yankees in the war,are the bad people. Vivien Leigh is so powerful, passionate, magnificent and beautiful that you she plays the role of Scarlett perfectly. She brings something so convincing and human to the role of the selfish spoilt Scarlett, she is larger than life.The complicated relationship between Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley, and Melanie is the fuel that keeps the movie going. The performance done by these characters really allows the viewers to feel the urge of the desire portrayed by the characters to try and make their relationships work. Both parties would do anything for each other. Despite Scarlett's hardness, she grows as a person. She slowly comes to value Melanie's friendship and support. At the end of the movie, she finally realizes how ill-suited she and Ashley have always been for each other, and how little passion ever actually existed there. She realizes that she really does love Rhett and would do anything she could to get him back, so she goes after him.",

Clark Gable is very good in the role, but Davis also wanted Errol Flynn in the lead. Selznik was not having it. The intrigue of the making of this film was far more interesting than the film itself.

416,12 August 2005,PWNYCNY,10, One of the great movies.,"This is a great movie, the reason for that being the incredible performance by Vivian Leigh who succeeds in carrying this movie. Without Leigh's strong and dominating performance, the story would have come off as hokey and melodramatic. Essentially, the story revolves around one person: Scarlett O'Hara, a flighty, impetuous, high-spirited and manipulative young woman who is pursuing a fantasy, to marry a man who does not love her and never will, and who by his own admission is a failure. People come and go, situations change, war starts and ends, but she never changes. Yet she also has endearing qualities - she is brave, resourceful, loyal, and a leader. She also commands respect. She is not adverse to working hard and stays focused on completing tasks. She understands business and is cognizant of the major political issues of the day. Of all the characters in the movie, she is the most complex, even more so than Rhett Butler. The story is engaging because of those many qualities which put her at odds with the rest of the world, which in the movie tests her ability and willingness to survive. Hence, Scarlett is hardly the conventional hero usually associated with Hollywood cinema. She is caught up in circumstances beyond her control that block her desire to achieve happiness, but refuses to back down. Nothing keeps her down. She will have her way because she is Scarlet O'Hara, and if the rest of the world doesn't like it, to bad for them.",

418,29 January 2005,barleeku,6, Can't get past the racism,"Okay, I know it's supposed to be one of the all time epic movie masterpieces, but is it really that good? I'll give the characters a two-dimensionality - barely - but they all play through to type. You can argue it doesn't matter with this movie, that film doesn't have the same responsibility as a novel to explore the nuances of its characters' emotions. But if a film is going to make a claim to be one of the greatest all time, it should show some greater development than Scarlett turning into a spunky survivor. Ultimately, I know the movie is beautifully done with many wonderful scenes, but it's an exercise in sentimental glorification of a world that was far more brutal, ugly, and hollow than the film even hints at. I don't expect a cinematic monograph on the evils of plantation society from a 1939 Hollywood epic, but I also don't have to swallow its assumptions wholesale. The gentility moaning away on their soulless spirituals recalls the ""pastoral scene of the gallant south"" that Billie Holiday sang of in her anti-lynching song, ""Strange Fruit"". The irony is that the lynchings didn't simply date from the Civil War era in which the film takes place, but from the very year and decade in which the film was made and released. So sorry, I give it a 6 for all it does so well, but thematically it has aged very poorly.",
419,14 January 2017,fanofbigvalley,10, One of the greatest historical films of all time...,"This is quite simply one of the greatest films of all time. Surprisingly accurate to the book, it follows the story of Scarlett O'Hara, the daughter of a plantation owner. She cares nothing about the important things in life, and revolves entirely on her whimsical desires and crushes. A complete and utter flirt, Scarlett literally throws herself upon the man that she believes herself to be in love with - Ashley Wilkes. Ashley isn't man enough to tell her that he doesn't love her, and her wild passion for him carries on as the South plunges into war against the Yankees. To spite Ashley marrying Melanie Hamilton, Scarlett marries Melanie's brother who dies at war. Her next marriage is also unsuccessful, and finally she ends up with the lovable rogue that is Rhett Butler. But it is only at the end when Scarlett's lifelong nightmare of running through a dark mist becomes reality, that she realizes that Ashley does not love her, and that it doesn't matter to her that he doesn't. The realization that she does indeed love her husband, Rhett, comes too late, as he has come to the decision to leave her. She asks him what she will do without him, to which he famously replies: ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."" Eventually she realizes that until Rhett returns to her, the only thing she has left is her home - the plantation Tara. As she looks out over the land, she finds a reason to hope - passing that hope onto the viewers that Scarlett's life might finally have some real happiness in it. The hope is verbalized in her well known saying, ""Tomorrow is another day!""",

I have always been a fanatic for anything Civil War themed, so when my mother recommended it to me, it was a yes from the start. The opening scenes show the young Scarlett O'Hara as she awaits her father's arrival. Beloved in the eyes of all the men in the county, Scarlett has acquired a high self-esteem, but when the War is announced to come after all, the high-spirited Scarlett soon faces obstacles that are determined to destroy her faith and her hope. She meets many people along the way, she even gets married. With new relationships, new responsibilities come as well. Rhett Butler, a man determined to have Scarlett for his own, comes into her life half way through both the novel and the movie, and he fights her on topics such as love, politics and societal roles. Even after the Civil War, Scarlett is still faced with many decisions. She has faced death, marriage and defeat many times. Still willing to go on, even when it seemed impossible, Scarlett leaves us with the last quote of the novel and book, ""After all, tomorrow is another day.""",

Though many auditioned there was only one scarlett and that was Vivien Leigh. Even the part of Rhett Butler could have been played by no one else than Clark Gable.

It's got everything that you could want in a soap opera.  Lavish costumes, magnificent sets, a vicious love triangle and characters that are larger than life.  Of course, with the characters, David O. Selznick scored big time.  Vivian Leigh radiates confidence and sexuality as Scarlett O'Hara.  Clark Gable is cool and charming as Rhett Butler.  Oliva DeHaviland, as Melanie, is the perfect embodiment of a Southern woman.  Set against the backdrop of the Civil War, the movie spans so much time and does it so well, you'll wonder what's happened to the previous three and half hours.  For its' time, Gone With The Wind was a major milestone in movie making.  The burning of Atlanta scene holds up pretty well, along with the massive crane shot that shows the thousands of soldiers laying on the ground.  The score can never be topped. Max Steiner struck gold with the sweeping ""Tara's Theme"" and every time you hear it, you can't help but think about Scarlett and the troubles she endures in  her life.

As the audience we see a story unfold for a total of four hours where we are never bored.

The best movie of all time, a highest-grossing film, the most famous and the most watched movie, the film with the most iconic quotes 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn', and so many other modifiers will still not capture the significance of 'Gone with the Wind'. It was well-made enough to attract more than half of the U. S population to theaters for four years after release and to impress international viewers with Hollywood glam, all happening in 1939. In 1939, I would have praised its story development and character development and said I had never seen such a confident, talented, and blunt women protagonist in the film history. It lasts for FOUR hours (Gosh, it was long), but that four hours are worth it because the movie tells so many stories based on different stages of Scarlett's life and has characters with distinctive personalities. The use of color in the movie is marvelous. When Scarlett stands on the top of Tara with her father, the camera zooms out and the audience sees the whole orange-ish screen. Great scene with great aesthetics: vast field and sunset. It looks as if rays touch all parts of the land as Scarlett will soon do. They represent her passion and care for homeland. After the war, audience watches more brown and red. Factories engulfed in flame, we see the screen full of red.

It really isn't like that, although have to admit my feminine side was stirred by the rich colours of the sumptuous ball-gowns in the early dancing scenes. Scarlett O'Hara is a total bitch - what a character. You want to see her fall flat on her face from early in the film onwards, but you keep watching and can't help admiring when she somehow survives and even thrives while most of those around her are suffering terribly. Clark Gable is a dude who would grace the modern film, or films of any era. Olivia De Havilland is quietly, radiantly beautiful, and even the usually boring Leslie Howard makes the rather dull role of Ashley Wilkes come to life.

I was taken back to Carol Burnett's fantastic portrayal of Scarlett walking down the stairs with a curtain rod stuck in her dress. I can't say much for the acting, Leigh and Gable left much to be desired. Hattie McDaniel was great, besides the other African Americans that made up the cast, that was it. The only good thing about this movie was that it gave African Americans speaking parts and was one of the only post code films in the late 30's the 40's and much of the 50's that was shown in the South that gave African Americans speaking parts and showed them in the movie.

It's not a war movie despite being cast in this times. The scenes with men are so stereo typical and distraught that you'd wonder how such men could actually be soldiers. The Southern Gentlemen' way was shoe horned into soiled babies and dummies with southern accents. So what's the big deal about this? A girl named Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and her predilection for misplaced infatuation of one, married and too old for her, Ashley Wilkes Leslie Howard). This is the film whose running story line (joke) is propped up by the noblest of Southern women captured by a genuine goodness or blind hospitality of his wife/cousin Melanie Hamilton ((Olivia de Haviland). If there is virtue exemplified, then Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) is vile glorified.

How anyone could not love this film is beyond me.  Vivian Leigh is magnificent and truly deserving of her Best Actress Award.  Scarlett is the only main character of any book I have ever read that did not put her as the herione and everyones favorite character.  She is the character you love and hate.  Love because, well she is the main character and the pretty southern belle that does have her moments.  And yet she hated because, let's face it...she's not very nice.  She does some very terrible things and acts like a brat throughout her life, but it's hard to hold that against her.  If only she would have wised up sooner and realized that Ashley is a wimp and that Rhett is so perfect for her.  Oh well! That is the charm of the film.  This movie earned every award it won.

Vivian Leigh was never better, Gable is both lovable and detestable at once. Olivia De Havilland is spectacular. And of course there is Hattie McDaniel. Is it a stereotypical performance? Well, absolutely! However, I must admit, she is wonderful in this movie. She is the voice of reason for the main characters in this movie. Her Academy Award winning performance was a huge milestone that I feel goes underappreciated. The only lead actor who I feel does not shine is Leslie Howard. He is just okay. He had a hard time keeping his British accent in check while playing a southern man. He is great in other films I've seen him in, but here is not one of his better moments.
When it was being made, it is easy to say that it was the biggest movie ever for its time, To put it in modern context, it was the Avengers: Endgame of its day. If you adjust for inflation, it is still the highest grossing film of all time.
Three different directors worked on this movie, and while this would be a hindrance to most movies, but it somehow helps here.
One of the best parts of the film is the amazing cinematography. This movie is full of great shots that are still imitated today. Let us not forget the incredible musical score by Max Steiner, a man who contributed scores to many other great films. The main theme is easily one of the best in movie history. The themes of survival and a changing world also ring in strong. Despite the movie taking place during one specific place and time, I feel that its themes transcend boarders and time periods.
Is Gone With the Wind the best movie ever? No. I can think of several better movies (Citizen Kane, The Godfather, In the Heat of the Night, Star Wars, Lawrence of Arabia, The Bridge on the River Kwai etc). And some of its politics are pretty outdated. However, It is an overall fantastic movie that should be watched at least once by anyone. Do yourself a favor and give this movie a shot. Or don't, frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.",
468,19 April 2023,AvionPrince16,9, Love and War,"Its mostly a story about love and war. We follow Scarlett in her life and we will witnessed her: poor, rich, with a Husband, jealous, working, try to survive in the war, have some child with Butler, have a husband killed, have a husband that she is not really satisfied with or with who she got some problems, a husband that she couldnt have(Ashley Wilkes), witness also the importance of her land at Tara, the death of her mother. It was pretty great also to see how she was pretty patient with Ashley Wilkins and how she waited for him like she was her husband. And how she started slowly to lost her illusions and to realise that she cant have him. And how she also because of the love of him she took care of his Wife and take care of the new baby who was born during the war. I love also the set design and how aestethic was the picture and how pleasant it was to watch the movie even in 2023. I also love to see the characters and their evolutions mostly Scarlett how she becomes more mature despite her hypocrisy sometimes mostly to Butler and when she tried to have the money trough him. Was kind of funny and unfair to watch but her motivation make us really want her to succeed in her intention. I love also some shots (the injured at the Gare and how the effect of the war was awful). I didnt know that i will enjoy that movie and i think its the first time that i watched a movie that long (4 hour) but i need to say that the plot, characters, context really make me dive into the movie pretty quickly and i need to say that movie was pretty ewsy to follow and entertaining enough to make me mesmerized trough the 4 hours. I can really recommend that movie. But for me it was mostly a story about love and war but it have also some other themes: infidelity, jealousy.... i mean it really felt like a daily life into the war and all that love bring.",

Scenario is brilliant. Character of Scarlet is absolute masterpiece. Vivien Leigh is the one perfect actress that is truly irreplaceable as Miss O' Hara, but not only that- the way that character of Scarlet grew through movie. First - She was a spoiled little brat flirting with men just to annoy other ladies and to prove herself being Queen B... And then in a war she is independent warrior, a true fighter that brought entire family back on their feet. She has balls, especially if we think of an era she comes from.

The character's were also so annoying, i don't think i've ever seen a movie where just about every character gets on my nerves to the point of it being ridiculous. There were only two characters that i didn't mind that was of course Hattie McDaniel's character (glad she won an Oscar.), and Olivia De Holland's character, everyone else irked me. This movie also ruined Clark Gable for me...now every time i see him all i'm going to remember is this movie, but i will say, that ending line was oh-so satisfying. There are also other things in this movie that annoyed me that are so stupid, i won't even mention but wow. I honestly didn't think i was going to finish this thing but by the grace of my Heavenly Father i did...

Scarlett O'Hara is the ultimate Southern belle, Rhett Butler her dashing rogue...and you even get to learn a little something about the Civil War! There's something for everyone in GWTW -- the horror of war, a heart-wrenching romance, comedy, tragedy, and deeply drawn characters. While many dislike Scarlett for her vanity and selfishness, she is a product of her times and her upbringing, and when the chips are down, she works her fingers to the bone to take care of those she loves.  She's a flawed heroine, and utterly compelling to watch (and if you want to learn the art of flirting, just watch her at work!)  And is there anyone more manly, more charming than Clark Gable as Rhett Butler?  This beautiful movie is one every person should experience!",
480,31 December 2009,pitsburghfuzz,8, A Beautiful Film,"GWTW was a 1936 novel written by Margaret Mitchell, and it was a phenomenon and every 14 year-old girl read the book multiple times. The movie takes place during the American Civil War and concentrates on the aftermath of the south and how the war seriously made the south pay for the old way of living. The story also concentrates on Scarlett O'Hara who is in love with Ashleyn Wilkes(Howard) but he is uninterested and marries his cousin Melanie(de Havilland)who is the kindest person period. The other main character is Rhett Butler(Gable) who is a blockade runner and frankly, doesn't give a damn. He and Scarlett are very much similar in the sense of they wanting to put their interests ahead of others to ensure their own happiness. The rest goes on, but this movie is just spectacular. Its long, but it is a film that everyone at some point needs to see. The film has the best film score ever and it gives the movie a more ""epic"" feel.

I can't count how many times I have seen it, and I still cry every time. What originally touched me when I first saw the film was Scarlett's strength and fearlessness. Rarely has there been a heroine equal to Scarlett O'Hara, and certainly not prior to 1939. She is selfish, ruthless, determined, manipulative and vain, but also courageous, protective, naive, loyal and at times compassionate. Rhett Butler is also selfish, vain and determined, and yet sophisticated with a wit to match and a tongue like a whip, he is Scarlett's perfect verbal sparing partner. To watch their relationship evolve is what has made this film an enduring love story. ",

489,2 January 2017,starrynights-64117,8," Definitely deserves the title of a ""classic""","After spending 4 hours watching ""Gone With The Wind"", I can see why it has been so critically acclaimed since its release in 1939. This motion picture combined many themes and ideas, and consisted of complex and dynamic characters who developed and grew as the story line played itself out. In particular, the protagonist Scarlett O'Hara is an incredibly feisty and passionate person who endures countless struggles in order to find happiness and stability once again after the Civil War demolishes her sense of reality. Even though she married 3 times and had more money than she knew what to do with, she always wanted more, more, more. When Rhett left her, the realization of her deep love for and the desire to return to her homeland, Tara, was an excellent way to wrap up the movie and bring the story full circle, as the story begins with dear Scarlett listening to her father tell her about the importance and continuity of land. However, the majority of the film was not as historically committed as it could have been. About halfway through, the focus shifts from the events of the Civil War, to the relationships between the characters. While this may not be a complaint for some viewers, others like myself hoped for a more focused and consistent view on the history of such an important time period throughout the movie. Also, the amount of racism was minimal, which is not true to the sentiments of the Deep South during this era. In summation, though there is some lack of historical accuracy, this film is definitely a must see, even 78 years later.",

She was born in 1900, well after the Civil War, and grew up hearing this stuff.  Of course they were going to paint themselves as righteous, gallant, wonderful people so horribly wronged by the Yankees just because they owned darkies like cattle, and who was little Peggy to argue with them?

This film takes the viewer back to Civil War America so convincingly that you cannot help but be pulled into the world of Scarlett O'Hara.

GONE WITH THE WIND is too lengthy to be crammed onto just one DVD; it's divided between TWO discs. I decided to make use of the ""Scene Selection"" feature, and scanned this menu on Disc One for something sounding worthy of my attention. Let's review Scene #25 (of 400 or so) to determine if GWTW merits a week of your time. Running 4 minutes, 32 seconds, ""ATLANTA BURNING"" begins about 1:22:57 into this cinematic marathon. A dude and a wench are descending a shadowy staircase, and the dame stammers ""Why, what--what's that?!"" as she clumsily anticipates ""Mrs. O'Leary's"" cow by dropping the lantern she's carrying. Since Georgia's capital always has been infamous for being a rat's nest tinder box, most of the city then explodes in a gargantuan conflagration three minutes later. Then the chagrined geezer accompanying the arsonist bimbo remarks ""It's a historic moment: One day you can tell your grandchildren how you burned down the Old South tonight."" Soon the Neighborhood Watch folks seem on the verge of bringing the Lady Firebug to Justice, but her henchman viciously drives them off with his whip. If this sounds like your cup of julep, go jump into GWTW's Lake of Fire.

You watch Scarlett go from a will-full (albet beautiful) child to a mature woman at the very end (who is still beautiful, will-full, and self-centered mind you, but you do see her grow).

This is a film which beautifully portrays a time in our history of great selfishness and over-indulgence.  Isn't that what the Civil War was all about?  A war fought by Americans that sought to curb the abhorrent, but selfish nature of slavery. The screenplay is replete with scene after scene of clever and witty banter amongst characters which were written to be overblown, caricatures of the Southerners they represented.  But the actors soften their edges and bring them to a fully realized persona.  Mammy, as portrayed by Hattie McDaniel, is funny, clever, brave, and utterly believable.  Vivian Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara is absolutely delightful as she takes the character from her late teens through late 30's.  She is coy/sassy/brave/dependent/independent on demand, throughout the movie.  Olivia DeHaviland, Clark Gable, Leslie Howard, Butterfly McQueen, Evelyn Keyes, Ann Rutherford, Ona Munson, and Laura Hope Crews as Aunt Pittypat are all completely enjoyable and believable in their characters.

Head-strong, spoilt, beautiful Scarlett O'Hara is the belle of the county. With more beaux than anyone she is envied by all girls, admired by all men. But the only young man of her friends who is not her beau is the one she wants. Ashley Wilkes is to marry his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, and Scarlett is determined that this should not occur. Meanwhile, Rhett Butler, the rich, debonair Scallawag, is determined to have Scarlett, by any means possible. His suave mockery at firsts irritates Scarlett, but his charm slowly wins her over. The American civil war throws Scarlett's world into disarray, dramatically changing her life, and everything she ever knew is now challenged. Gone With the Wind tells Scarlett's story, of her three marriages, her struggles for money, food and security, her love for Ashley and her dislike for his wife, the kind-hearted, gentle Melanie.

The relationship between Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara is never stereotypical or predictable. At first, the love triangle between Scarlett, Melanie and Ashley Wilkes seems cliché, like a soap opera decades before ""The Young and the Restless"", until Clark Gable as Butler literally steps into the picture and messes up the melodrama. One of the best scenes occurs when Scarlett professes her love to Ashley in private at a large social gathering and unbeknown-st to the characters, Rhett Butler is hiding behind a couch watching the drama unfold. When he finally reveals himself to her, the scene moves into new and unchartered territory, and we learn that neither Scarlett nor Butler are stereotypical characters.

516,31 October 1998,sirzboy,10, The Best American Movie Ever,This is by far the best American Film ever made.  The acting is right on for the character.  Vivian Leigh is ideal for the melodramatic Scarlett.  Clark Gable's charm is right on and is his best acting role (closely followed by It Happened One Night).  Olivia De Havilland's idealistic Melanie is the perfect foil to the self-centered Scarlett.  Hattie McDaniel is the actress that did the unthinkable; she upstaged Vivian Leigh in almost every scene the two actresses shared.,

Arguably one of the best motion pictures ever made, the movie does a fantastic job portraying the roles of women and different relationships between races in the Civil War South. Winning an astounding eight academy awards, the story follows the South through events leading to the Civil War through the Scarlett O'Hara's endeavours.",
518,10 May 2008,rose-294,8, Gorgeous movie of trashy people,"Even after 70 years, this film holds it's own pretty well. The jewel-like 1930s Technicolor makes the ornate 19th century sets and lovely gowns look even more stunning, the story has epic sweep, and heroine Scarlett is both lovely and lively, albeit ultimately (and by accident) portrayed as truly ugly human being, just like every member of Southern upper-class. White trash indeed! (And no, this is not racism, I'm white!) All this comes from the source of GWTW, the novel by Margaret Mitchell, which is a love letter to the antebellum South but seems sometimes almost despising the characters. Her book is still quite good romantic drama, if one can stomach the sporadic whining and self-pity - it is thankfully largely cut from this movie.",

To fill out this stupid story, we add a colorful backdrop of the civil war and paint a romantic Picture of the old south. The problem is that to make a story interesting, You need to be able to feel some sympathy for the main character, but unfortunately Scarlett has absolutely no redeeming qualities. She's spoiled, self centered and completely not interesting as a person. As to the movie itself i suppose it lives up to Hollywood standards technically. There wasn't really much they could do with the story, but visual quality aside, sitting through 4 hours of this romantic rubbish is pure torture.",

Melanie is so very good you can't possibly believe or like her, most of the other characters not worth much attention either. The only half likable person was Rhett Butler; no, not for his masculinity (heroic males are bad enough, but needy useless females flocking around them are worse).

The film starts off with Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, a selfish, hot-tempered Southern lady, who becomes exceedingly depressed when Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), the man she loves, is getting married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Scarlett then meets a man, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable, in a superlative performance) who falls in love with her. Scarlett feels vague love for him, but she can't take her mind off of Ashley. Scarlett feels her life it tearing apart, when the Yankees come to attack and Ashley is fighting in the war, and what happens at the end is a lesson Scarlett should've learned from the advice that people taught her. It is a powerful, heart-breaking story that will leave you weeping. I believe it deserves to be much higher on the top 250 list. This film is among the greatest films I have seen in my life, and it is the greatest love film I have seen in my life.

To me, it is instructive that time has dropped the rating from a 10 to an 8? Still overrated, in my view. Fans continue to echo the fanfare billboards of '39, when I, as a soph in college, sat through the Berkeley ""premiere"" with lady friend and, after the three-and-three-quarter hour melee, opined: interesting, but no cigar. Besides, it's butt-wearying. I have not seen the film again, but adoring fans, worldwide?, notwithstanding, I still have major plaints, to wit: 1: Has anyone else detected?, or am I mistaken, the egregious plagiarization by Margaret Mitchell, UNconsciously?, of the four chief protagonists in William Makepeace Thackeray's ""Vanity Fair"" plunked down in the Civil War ""South""??? 2: It took nearly FOUR hours of feckless ""romanticisms"" to reach an er, ah, ""climax"" of Rhett's sublimation of passion? Not to mention a ""daring"" uttering of the word ""damn""? 3: Whereas the heavily lobbied Oscar went to Hattie McDaniel, few seem to mind the Priss of Butterfly McQueen, who summons the ghosts of Step'n Fetchits past. I gagged, I kid you not. And I wasn't even aware, at the time, of my racial sensitivities. 4: Finally, despite a feisty Vivien Leigh, neither Olivia de Havilland nor Leslie Howard could rescue their roles from the doldrums of tedious tepidity. Forget Clark, who finally came to some life vis-a-vis Claudette Colbert when he finally blew the horn on their Wall of Jericho in an arguably deserving Oscar-winning vehicle. Today, I can only think of one candidate to rival ""GWTW"" for cinematic afflatus, and that is the Oscar-dominating ""Titanic."" The sight of was it James Cameron? pumping his fist and avowing his just deserts was less than inspiring. Here, I would place Viggo Mortensen's at the time six-year-old scion, Henry, as a proper ""critic."" The boy is said to have said, after sitting through the watery precincts: ""It should have been about the boat."" And not that laughable?, well, certainly corny, between-decks ""romance"" and emblematic necklace/pendants?

I know everything there is to know about the movie. Granted the book is a lot better, but it's also over 1,000 pages. Which for some is too much reading, but it's well worth it. It goes into much more detail and explains a lot more. The movie is very true to the book so you aren't missing too much. But there is a lot to be learned in the book it's self, well worth the read. Needless to say this really is the greatest movie ever made. If you haven't seen it go see it. And if you don't want to because it's 3 hours and 55 minutes long, get over it, it's a beautiful movie.

552,22 October 2020,jamesfalace,7, One of the most Classic and well known movies in history,"This takes place during the American civil war in the south. It's about a woman named scarlet who is in love with a man named Ashley. She is devastated because Ashley has plans to marry his cousin. She confesses her love to him during the engagement party and he denies her which makes her even more sad. She then meets a guy named Rhett who is into her. The barbecue/engagement party gets interrupted by the news of a civil war. Each man there then join the army to fight for the confederacy. Scarlet tries to make Ashley jealous by marrying his fiancé's younger brother, who then goes on to die in the war later on. Several months later the confederacy starts to weaken from the union, which leads to scarlet and Ashelys fiancé leave the city with Rhett as the city starts to get taken over by the union. They go to the town of Tara, Ashley now meets up with scarlet and they both confess their love for one another but says that he won't leave his fiancé. Scarlett then marries a man name Frank for his money who also dies soon after that in the war. Rhett and scarlet then decide to get married and have a daughter together even though Scarlett clearly still has feelings for Ashley. Scarlett then gets into an altercation with Rhett about her feelings for Ashley while he's drunk. She later on becomes pregnant with Rhett which leads to an argument which ends with her falling down the stairs and suffering a miscarriage. Her oldest child from Rhett dies from an accident with her horse, leading to even more sadness on Scarletts end. Ashley's wife starts to slowly die and Scarlett soon loses feelings for Ashley during this process. She realizes that she actually loves Rhett But it's too late and he leaves for good. This is a very sad and emotional movie and it shows the good and bad of several situations expecially war. The directors do a great job with transferring Scarletts feelings into you as you watch and learn her story. Although the story line is all over the place, I still find it very entertaining and unpredictable, especially when she suffers a miscarriage and then her daughter passing away. I expected more out of this movie because it is one of the most popular of all time, so I was a little underwhelmed but it's not bad at all.

She obsessed about certain men, she was charming, and she was a good actress. I fell in love with Clark Gable after this film.   He made me believe in my heart that underneath sarcasm there is a heart. Olivia De Havilland was breath taking as Melanie Hamilton and Leslie Howard was a perfect Ashley Wilkes.

Vivien Leigh is phenomenal, even though she completely over-acts.  Like I said...it works!

This story of the American Civil War comes from the only novel written by Margaret Mitchell. I tried to read the novel years ago but was unable to crack it. I have seen the film. After learning of the 65th Anniversary DVD, I want to see it again. I was in Atlanta recently and haunted by the thought of Tara, Scarlett's plantation. I want to pay attention to Scarlett.

Gone With the Wind was shot entirely in gorgeous technicolor; the scene of the fire in Atlanta required the use of all eight technicolor cameras in existence at the time.I've never seen such a kind of classic film. The scenery and photography is possibly the most superb ever done in the history of film. Many scenes are just sumptuously lit and filmed. The gripping nighttime escape from Atlanta (the whole city seemingly in flames) is one of the most spectacular action sequences ever done. The sunsets are jaw-droopingly beautiful Much has been said about the supposed racism of this film. It's true that it does portray black slaves as being HAPPY to be slaves. But much more important, it's also true that the wisest person in the whole movie is Mammy. This black lady may be a slave--- later an employee--- but she is smart, funny, observant, and she's treated as an equal, if not a superior, throughout the movie. And it's made clear she deserves it. With no irony or rebuke whatever, she scornfully refers to certain low-life as ""poor white trash"", and we know (Mammy knows too) that if they get called that, they deserve it. She may be black, but she isn't inferior to them or anybody. And we root for her all the way.",
568,24 June 2001,HenryHextonEsq,7, A reasonable film !,"This legendarily popular epic romantic melodrama is in my opinion far from the greatest picture ever made, but is certainly a fine lavish spectacle. It would've been better if I'd viewed it in a cinema, as the photography was clearly luxurious and didn't best suit the small screen. The music is rather fitting, embellishing the emotions of the film well. I thought the historical period was well established, even if one should treat its accuracy as questionable. As for the political correctness, the attitudes and situations prevalent in the film regarding gender and race are redolent of earlier times and cannot be judged in view of today's standards. If it were made similarly today, one would suspect some indignation would arise, and probably be justifiable. I suppose it's the factor of the black slaves being so unrealistically happy in their place that seems historically questionable to me. The film's acting was mixed really; despite its length certain performers either fail to leave an adequate impression (Leslie Howard) or aren't given enough to do (Thomas Mitchell). Vivien Leigh creates a far from particularly nuanced role, but an effective one. Scarlett is indeed a rather flawed, stroppy girl, but one is compelled to follow her miseries with interest. Clark Gable truly gives the finest performance here though, creating a wonderfully wry, suave and likeable character. The plot itself is unspectacular, with aspects of the romantic entanglements not convincing as they should, largely due to Leslie Howard's below-par performance. The extent of Scarlett's self-delusion/misguidedness seems unlikely, even for her character. The length of the film was no problem really, as my interest was largely maintained. I would say the earlier part of the film, before the War is indeed the most cinematically accomplished part, with a good atmosphere well created, and the plot moves on quicker later on, with the numerous tragedies and episodes being well conveyed. There is a fine ending, although it should have ended straight after Gable's ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn!"" ripsote. Clark Gable's fine acting, a steady storyline, fine music and photography are the aspects of this film that most impressed. I wouldn't call it overrated as such, because it is indeed a cinematic milestone, but there are better old films out there, and of the two major popular successes of the year 1939, I find ""The Wizard of Oz"" more enjoyable.

This thing is the triumph that haunted producer David O. Selznick until his death. It's extravagant, it's well made, it's a landmark, it's highly overrated. What we have here is three good directors slaving under a maniacal producer to film a stuffy book to his satisfaction. The film is praised for its romance and scale, but its true assets are the crew and Clark Gable, whose Rhet Butler charmed the pants off multiple generations of viewers. The picture is a testament to the worth of the studio system. The trouble is that it just isn't as great as people say it is. The story is far from being the best (although it would be a challenge to find a better romance-against-the-backdrop-of-war picture). There are mistakes, like a pregnancy that lasts too long. Parts of the film drag terribly, particularly Scarlet and Rhet's marital troubles. In spite of all its strengths, GONE WITH THE WIND cannot rise above its short-comings to be what people claim it is.

607,25 October 2019,peir-48811,9, Unit 2 project,"Gone with the Wind is one of the many memorable films of Hollywood's Golden Age and illustrates the story written by Margaret Mitchell. The film has an outstanding cast and tells an entertaining story about the life of Scarlett O'Hara. The film was made in 1939 but gives a great insight into WW2 and views on african americans for the time period as well. The main actress Vivien Leigh was british and found the character Scarlett to be a real woman. Vivien wanted to portray the character as accurately as possible trying to learn southern gestures, cultures, and even asking advice from southern fans. At one point some southerners sent her locusts native to the south as she did not know what they were. Vivien's efforts paid off as she won her first Oscar for the leading role in this film. For an up and coming actress to land the lead role in one of the most historical epics is already a feat in itself but her accolades prove how she was able to really become the character and connect with the audience. The supporting actor playing Scarlette's lover Rhett is Clark Gable. Clark Gable had starred in a few other movies before this and played a very suave character in this film. He was nominated for an Oscar in a few different roles including the one in this movie however he did not receive an award for this film. However, as the audience watches the movie you never see Clark Gable but only the character Rhett Butler. Clark has the ability to engulf the audience in the story and draw people in because his acting seems almost too real to be fake. Together these two lead roles took the stage and portrayed the life of the stubborn and glamorous Scarlett O'Hara. Scarlett is a fascinating character with faults and a sense of realism that was a bit strange for this time period. At the beginning of the movie she is in love with a man named Ashley but he loves someone else, she then meets Rhett and their romance blossoms. Their romance is a main part of the film but it focuses mainly on Scarlett and her mix of good and bad decisions with the civil War going on in the background. Throughout the book you find Scarlett in different phases and attitudes of life as she continues to lose many of those she loves. No matter what happens Scarlett famously always moves on and will always be alright. 'Her motto was not just for her though; as the film is set in the civil war WW2 was on the horizon in the real world and had brought many concerns and fears with it. Many small words of wisdom and brave actions by Scarlett during the film, such as helping soldiers and having to be strong at losing her loved ones, set examples for people to follow and made them feel better about what their future entitled. Audience members found comfort in the idea that if stubborn scarlett could persist through war times they could too. Sentiments towards war were not the only projectiles towards the real world. Throughout the film scarlett always has trusted slaves to be there for her and they are happy to serve her. Gone With the Wind portrays African Americans as happy serving white masters but as most have larned slavery was not a joyous event. Part of the outlook on African Americans expressed is due to the book and that it was written during the civil war but the film also reflects how some people viewed African Americans as lesser people. Segregation was a strong force in the US and there was no sign of a Civil Rights Act till much later with the rise of Martin Luther King Jr. and when it was passed in 1964. The film advocates for the idea of scientific racism and a world where African Americans should be proud to be second class citizens. It's interesting to see how timeless films can express so much about the era they were made in and how much more people tend to find when they rewatch movies. Gone With the Wind was an outstanding epic with amazing acting and a strong story to help reflect how people of the time period viewed WW2 and African American Rights.",

Just before the war begins, the pampered and beautiful Scarlett -- whose family plantation is called Tara -- attends a ball. There, she discovers that her object of affection, Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), has become engaged to his cousin, Melanie (Olivia de Havilland). In a fit of jealousy, Scarlett accepts a proposal from Melanie's brother -- but not before she meets the dashing Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), who can't keep his eyes off of her.

However I seen that it was on again and I just had to watch the full movie because it is so famous and a lot of the people on this website said it was a classic. So this time I didn't find it boring, I found it to be a good movie BUT not a classic, not a masterpiece, and not a rewatchable movie. I might watch this movie again in my life but I'm sure it won't be for a couple of years.

I think if they were to do an update of it i would love to see George Clooney play Rhett Butler and Kate Beckingsale as Scarlett.Just an updated version not a remake!! I first watched the movie as a kid and have watched it many times since then. I've read and watched both GWTW and Scarlett. I have just finished reading Rhettt Butler's people which tells the other side of the greatest love story ever told. I have recently bought both movies in their original full length.Even though GWTW came out in 1939 to me it is one of my favourites. I have seen other movies with Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. None of them seem to match up to GWTW.,
619,21 February 2007,kcdreems,10, The wind hasn't left,"Gone with the Wind is an excellent American classic. If i listed all the reasons why i loved it i'd be on this computer for days! As for the people who say that all it was about was spoiled southern belles and a terrible plot I say there wrong. The movie is telling about a bratty teenager in the ""old south"" who learns and grows to be a courage's women through the experiences of her life through out the destruction of her world. Now, this goes towards the people who say that all it was about was racism. First of all that was the way it was back then in that point in time and David O. Selznick couldn't just lie to the audience. You need to accept the fact that African-Americans were not always free. And the movie is not stating that slavery was right, but simply the way it was back then. So F.Y.I. to the people who are either too young to understand or think that every thing from the southern perspective of things is always racist get a clue. And the people who say that this movie was portraying the Yankee troupes as brutes are wrong. Some of them really were brutes to the southern men and women but the movie never stated or portrayed that all of them were terrible. Also they were not trying to set bitterness into the audience towards the African-American carpet bagger but again they were portraying the way that most of the southern population thought about the bill collectors. They did not have enough money to pay the bills on their homes after the south was destroyed and the carpet bagger, in most eyes, was a nightmare because they had little finances. So with all this said and done believe me when I say THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER!!!",
620,19 May 2017,daviddaphnered,10, THE big movie for ages,"This was the great feat for Hollywood the other side of ""The Godfather"". The movie is much quoted even today, more than seventy years after its release in 1939. It is an understatement to say it is no wonder that it won the Best Picture award for that same year. Truly, Margaret Mitchell's very long novel (a little over a thousand pages long) was definitely a great feat for the outstanding producer David O. Selznick and directors Victor Fleming and George Cukor, and a great accomplishment for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as well. This definitely made Clark Gable a household name after he played excellently the role of Rhett Butler, and the career of Vivien Leigh was catapulted in this great classic as she played the role of Scarlett O'Hara. The young Olivia deHavilland did something for her career in the movies as well by acting well the part of Melanie Wilkes. Truly Leslie Howard, who played Ashley Wilkes, the husband of Melanie as well as the owner of the plantation Twelve Oaks, typified a southern gentleman, even though in real life Howard was originally from England. Hattie McDaniel was the epitome of a southern mammy. Thomas Mitchell was an almost-perfect actor in his role as Mr. O'Hara, the owner of the plantation Tara and also Scarlet's father. Though not a major actor here, Harry Davenport was quite impressive as Dr. Meade. Butterfly McQueen was there mainly for decorative purposes, but herself did well. The movie depicted well the War Between the States very realistically and graphically, of course. (I will have to tell something on myself: when I was almost eight years of age in the summer of 1954 when this movie was a return, the burning of Atlanta was so loud that I declared to myself that I would never see this movie again, though that did not become the truth.) The screaming wounded Rebel soldiers(though many of them were actually mannequins) added to the cinematic work being realistic and graphic. And, of course, the undulating romance twixt Butler and Scarlett O'Hara was excellently depicted. And too, the southern pride of the characters came across strongly; after all, Scarlett fought well for the reconstruction of the estate Tara at all costs including lying and stealing. Though the movie was originally filmed in B&W, the color did come through beautifully later. And, who can forget the closing line of Gable/Butler to Leigh/Scarlett ""Frankly, my dear, I don't..."" (Surely the reader of this knows the completion of the line.) A fine of at least a thousand dollars was imposed for using that unforgettable line. For all the reasons listed, definitely it has been for over half a century a movie whose very title has a special ring to it.",

After the fourth silhouettes against the setting sun shot within the first 30 minutes, even the beauty of those scenes was diluted to visual doggerel. One of the few entertaining scenes was the newly widowed Scarlett dancing a jig below the serving table top at a soirée. As for historical accuracy - never mind.

Just before the war begins, the pampered and beautiful Scarlett -- whose family plantation is called Tara -- attends a ball. There, she discovers that her object of affection, Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), has become engaged to his cousin, Melanie (Olivia de Havilland). In a fit of jealousy, Scarlett accepts a proposal from Melanie's brother -- but not before she meets the dashing Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), who can't keep his eyes off of her.

634,9 April 2009,jwardww,7, A foul wind...please recast Ashley!,"The production values are spectacular and many of the performances are excellent, but the central theme of a romantic triangle ultimately fails to convince. It isn't that Leslie Howard was a bad actor. He was a great Henry Higgins. He was simply not the right casting choice for Ashley Wilkes. Yes, he played Ashley as a moralizing weakling, which is how Mitchell wrote the character. But he could not create the charisma one needed to sympathize with Scarlet's feelings of loss. Had Howard been cast opposite someone like Miriam Hopkins as Scarlet O'Hara, he would have held his own well enough. But throughout the 3 plus hours of the movie as produced with Vivien Leigh in the title role, one is too mystified as to why someone so glamorous and sexual as Scarlet cares about this flat-liner. One can't even buy it with the explanation that she only wants what she can't have or she only wants someone who rejects her. It's not just because Howard comes across as a colossal closet case, who married Melanie only because no one would expect sexual ardor of him with such a woman. It's just that Vivian Leigh's Scarlet is so aware of her worth and radiance, one can't imagine her being enthralled by anyone so inferior as Ashley, someone who doesn't even stand up well in comparison to her other long-shot suitors, let alone to Rhett. This fatal casting flaw makes the movie a magnificent misfire. In a few years, with the advance of computer imaging technology and convincing vocal duplication, Gone With The Wind can at last be redone with the existing footage enhanced by a better casting choice for Ashley spliced in. There are two ideal actors from the period. Both are blonds and exceptionally virile, offering a much more convincing counterbalance to the machismo of Clark Gable. The first is Errol Flynn, who, had he been cast, would have played wimpy against type and beat Gable and Robert Donat that year for the Oscar. The Academy loves the fabulous playing unfabulous. The second choice would be Brian Aherne, like Flynn also breathtakingly handsome and able to play the character as written by Mitchell. Both casting choices would have made the viewer understand Scarlet's misguided attraction. You would totally comprehend how it is possible to look at such a man and imagine something that is not there in a way that simply is not possible with Leslie Howard in the role.",

It is the Titanic of its day, financially viable, idealised and romanticised to levels that only Hollywood can bring and given that the source material is basically one of the world's first harlequin romance novels it is impressive what Fleming achieves and nothing should take away from the skill he exhibited, but ultimately the movie is lacking in knowledge of the time period (but given the history of films that is to be expected) and in its writing which is not something a movie based on a book should ever fail at, but we have all seen countless poor films spun from decent literature.",
636,27 January 2003,lula-3,10, Probably the Greatest Movie of All Time,"If the U.S. had to export one film only to third world/foreign nations to depict U.S. history, and the magnificence of U.S. art, this would be it. Few movies tell a fairly detailed and accurate(covering the siege of Atlanta to blacks in uniform to carpetbaggers) story of the greatest war in the greatest country, with the greatest actors.  This is THE epic film, THE American masterpiece, equal to Huckleberry Finn in literary significance. A wonderful, romantic, morality tale wrapped in epic, historic proportion. Hattie McDaniel as Mammy makes us laugh and cry, though she is just the ""supporting"" actress. (She makes Hallie Berry look like chopped liver!). McDaniel portrays humanity and dignity in African-American slaves/servants - and so, in African-Americans in general. (probably not done much before this).  Though GWTW doesn't capture much of the inhumanity and cruelty of slavery, there was a taste of it when Scarlet slaps Butterfly McQueen's character, Prissy.  This may have been, in 1939, about all America was ready to publicly acknowledge, but it was an important acknowledgement.  And, certainly, a beginning to much future thought, discussion and action. GWTW is so great, on so many levels, it is mind-boggling.  Thoroughly enjoyable and shockingly real, with new lessons, each time I watch it. It will never become aged, outdated.",

What impressed me the most and what struck me the most should be Scarlett's truth. She is free and unrestrained, and is not bound by those rules. She likes to be close to her, and she does not hide her disgust if she does not like it.

The film unfolded the events of the American Civil War. Main character- Scarlett O'Hara is a free-spirited, willful modern woman who lives a unconstrained life taking advantage of the attention of men.

645,28 September 2009,minamurray,10, Glorious movie and true classic,"Positive: Made in 1939, this adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's novel about selfish Southern belle and American Civil War shows how badly made many modern movies are. Colours are rich and beautiful, unlike in most modern films, making costumes, sets and scenery look gorgeous. It has really epic quality and vibrancy. Vivien Leigh is perfect as heroine Scarlett - lovely to look and full of life, but rotten to the core in the same time. Negative: Morally the movie is more problematic. I am not fan of Kim Newman, but I think he said it well: He gave it 5/5 rating in Empire but said it is a movie of ""selfish cow"". Quite frankly, treatment of everybody outside Southern upperclass - including Northerners and poor whites - is irritating. Ku Klux Klan, who terrorized blacks and whites, is supposedly a group of chivalric knights. And the movie was actually cleansed version of the story: book is full of whiny, maudlin, glorified trash who murder and terrorize left and right and never takes responsibility of their own actions.

646,24 April 2009,Burleigh7,4," An Epic, Lushly Filmed Soap Opera is Still a Soap Opera","Gone With The Wind has a reputation as an all time classic, but it is unfortunately hollow and even fluffy. The film is ultimately a four hour soap opera concerning the travails of a spoiled brat, an obnoxiously self centered loud mouthed young woman. Scarlett is not easy to like, and neither is the smug Rhett. It's difficult to sit through four hours with two lead characters that are hard to sympathize with. The film romanticizes the south in a laughably superficial depiction, and the portrayal of African Americans are demeaning stereotypes; it's too bad that the first African American Oscar Winner, Hattie McDaniel, had to play such an exaggerated stereotype to win. Of course, this was 1939, so it wouldn't be so much of a problem if the rest of the film was not so melodramatic, especially the last quarter of the film. The rather limited story is stretched to fit the epic running time, but it feels flat rather than majestic. You may say it's a timeless classic, but frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.",

648,1 March 2019,packerhof,9, A labor of love,"This review is less about the story line, and more about the labor of love, the level of professionalism and perfection that went into bringing this commentary of a dark time in our nations history, and the very fabric of what should be making our country stronger.
Historically, there was so much more that went into the civil war. This story was but a sliver of that time. Fleming went to great lengths to show the horrors of war, the miles of bodies, injuries, predjudices and the like. The use of the camera to tell the story of love and deception of the innermost kind. Good or bad, it all survives. Sherman takes Georgia, Atlanta burns, people turn into animals in regards to the spoils of war and the Grace of God can be found. Once you choose who the heroine is, you see they both survive-one in meekness and the other in spirit. Atlanta and Scarlett's Tara still survive! Similar to Citizen Kane's Rosebud, it comes back to Tara.. and tomorrow. This was the first color picture to win the best picture award. The strength of which was the cinematography and the ability to cut a story that saw Mammy get grey (Hattie McDaniel's Award winning supporting role award for her awesome portrayal) going from the talk of war, the act of war, and the aftermath all in 238 minutes. (It's worth noting Hattie was the first African/American to not only be nominated, but to win the Oscar, deservingly so) Olivia de Havelland was as much the star as Vivian Leigh, in this long cast of great performances. Vivian Leigh took home Best Actress, well deserved. Victor Fleming took the best director. The film also took home best cinematography and Art direction.
Sadly, Sid Howard would get his Oscar posthumously for the magnificent screenplay. That was the first time an award was given posthumously. The film took home the Technical Achievement Award. Very well deserved because Hal Kern and RD Musgrave, the film nearly 80 years later, still takes you back to Atlanta during the civil war.",

I liked the costumes and the scenery, I felt it gave a very thorough look at the South during the Civil war. The struggles and the days of the war were very realistic. I liked when Scarlet said ""I will never go hungry again"" It showed the strength of a real southern family. Being one of the first color films in history, it was really something to see. Although I am old enough to have seen the film in a theater at the time, I don't recall that. I did see it at an elder hostel and learned much about the era and the making of the movie. I also remember watching it through the years with my family back on Long Island in the 1970's on the Million Dollar Movie on a local channel. I now have the pleasure of watching it with my grandson who is a very big movie fan and will most likely be working in the film industry when he grows up. Movies like Gone with the Wind are great for families and great for learning history.",

657,11 January 2014,daumi500,10," An unforgettable movie, the story of a woman ahead of her time.","The unforgettable movie ""Gone with the wind"" is certainly a landmark in the history of cinema. The film was based on the best-selling novel of the same name by author Margaret Mitchell, and had the backdrop of the civil war between the North and the South of the United States, which has also been called the ""war of secession"". It charmed generations, and is considered the most beloved and unforgettable movie of all time, and the most watched, because it can reunite the elements that hold the viewer's attention. Filmed in color with the new technology Technicolor and Cinemascope, the movie was released in 1939, presenting a dramatic storyline, a strong soundtrack and the magnificent performance of Vivien Leigh for the character Scarlett, that led her to win an Oscar for the best actress in that year. ""Gone with the wind"" was also nominated to other Oscar categories, won eight and, outside of the traditional nominations, won two other special ones (an honorarium and an other technical). I still remember the time when I was a teenager; I had not completed my 13 years yet when I watched this movie for the first time. It was love at first sight, because I enjoyed everything, especially the charisma of the character Scarlett O'Hara, who even in the face of adversity has never been shattered by something or someone. My attachment to this film was so great that after having watched it for more than five times, I decided to even read the book, which I thought was wonderful. It is a volume with more than 1000 pages. The movie starts in the year 1861, where in front of the spectator opens the scenario of a lush southern farm cotton plantation in the State of Georgia named Tara, where the protagonist Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), a spoiled and willful young woman receives the news that Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), a man who was bored with his life, will marry his cousin Melanie Hamilton (Olivia Havilland). Scarlett is in love with Ashley, and decides to confess her love for him at a barbecue offered by Ashley's parents, at Twelve Oaks. There Scarlett meets Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), who was hiding in the library at the time of her revelation. Rhett was known as a good living and seductive man. He was enchanted by Scarlett and he promised to keep her secret. At a given time one hears the news that the war has been proclaimed. Scarlett, in order to hurt and to be close to Ashley, accepts to marry Charles Hamilton (Rand Brooks), brother of Melanie. Charles, with typhus, died in battle and Scarlett became a widow. The war continues and Atlanta is under siege. Scarlett decides to run away toward Tara, helped by Rhett. There she faces many adversities and she makes an oath: ""God is my witness. God is my witness they're not going to beat me. I'm going to live through this and when it's all over, I'll never be hungry again. Neither I nor anyone in my family. Even if I have to lie, steal, cheat or kill, God is my witness that I'll never be hungry again"". Again in trouble, Scarlett creates situations and uses trickery to achieve her goals. The film ending is surprising to everyone, because Scarlett discovers something she herself did not know. This movie shows Scarlett's determination depicting a woman ahead of her time.",

She never loses her momentum despite the fact she is on screen in almost every scene. Together with Clark Gabel, Leslie Howard, and Hattie McDaniel she creates the ultimate Hollywood picture. GWTW is revolutinary also in it's brilliant use of color and art direction as well as landmark special effects.

667,10 February 2013,wc1996-428-366101,5," The Greatest Film of All Time - Yeah, Right","Okay, so GWTW is considered to be the greatest film of all time with the largest audience of any film ever made, blah, blah, blah. But let's get real folks and look at GWTW in modern terms and face a few facts. First of all, and most important, is the story and what a story it is. It's like a civil war version of any soap on television. The story is simply not original. Scarlett O'Hara, the heroine - if she can be called that - is utterly loathsome. I mean she does not have one single redeeming trait. She's the classic woman you love to hate - the kind of woman Joan Crawford cut her eye teeth on and Joan Collins elevated to a high state of hysteria. Please! But there is so much that is absolutely annoying about the film aside from the fact all you want to do with Scarlett is put her over your knee and give her a well-deserved spanking. Of course these days you can't possibly do such a thing - you would be charged with felony assault and locked up in the local slammer for a year! But I digress. The music about drove me up the wall. If I had to listen to the GWTW theme one would time I would be running into the sunset never to look back. Clark Gable of course is superb - but then he's always superb. But look at what he went through to give the performance he did? The original director, George Cukor, bothered Gable so much that the actor had the director fired. By the time Victor Fleming came aboard he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown having just completed The Wizard of Oz - in fact Fleming did have a nervous breakdown when GWTW was completed. But the real problems with the film lay squarely in David Selznick's lap. His obsessive dedication to the novel show in every scene which are over blown and over the top every time. The story is not that big but Selznick has turned it into a story of Biblical proportions and in the process simply turned the film into something grotesque and horrible.",
668,5 July 2000,Liedzeit,10, There is a lot to be said for it,"""There is a lot to be said for it"" is a song by the Sparks who really make fun of it, continuing ""but I don't know what..."" I certainly do. It is quite simple. GWTW is the best film ever made by any serious and sensible criteria. Magnificent story, wonderful acting, especially Leigh (although she was clearly miscast, since the book said Scarlett was not beautiful - only joking), great music etc. It is amazing that you can watch it again and again feeling just poor delight. You never have the feeling of being confronted with a piece of art. Although it clearly is the highest art. It makes me sad to hear that people do not like it. It is something I should accept but I really cannot. Especially if looking back after sixty years it is denounced as politically incorrect. As a guest present to the first alien race we will meet someday what do we choose? Festen? Independence Day? Taxi Driver? GWTW would be perfect. One more thing: Except maybe for Name of the Rose there is not a better transition of a book to the big screen.",

Also, very good choices from filmakers to not include some things in movie that are in book, such as Scarlett's kidds from previous marriages etc. People who didn't read the book seems to don't know how hard is to portray Scarlett O'Hara's character because she's the most narcissistic and most cold-blooded snake even to her kids (and that's one of the reasons why is it so hard to read this book - i mean it's written mostly in first person, from Scarlett's twisted childish mind's perspective) and I can assure you, Vivien Leigh did an amazing job and this is one of the best performances ever, i'm simply stunned.

Selznick). The Civil War drama depicts the Georgian land of Tara, owned by the O'Hara Estate. Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara is shown as a young girl desired by most men of the Confederacy, who entertain her while they consider the possibility of going to war. ""Fiddle dee-dee - war, war, war..."" are her first words. This is one of her catchphrases along with ""Tomorrow is another day"" and ""I'll think about that tomorrow"". They define her personality, which is that of escaping hardship by taking the easy way out. The story revolves around her relationship to her father Gerald, her friends Ashley and Melanie, and her lover Rhett, among numerous characters in the midst. Vivien Leigh is so good in her performance, that she makes the intense nationwide hunt for the part of Scarlett O'Hara seem fulfilled. Other actresses I'm crazy about considered for the part like Katherine Hepburn and Bette Davis could not have given Scarlett the intensity and range that Leigh provides. She and Clark Gable are one of the strongest duos ever to battle on screen.",

Gone With The Wind was a pioneer in Film making and It will always be remembered when such films as Lord of The Rings(#12) and Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind(#32) are long forgotten. It is a classic Tale and one the any person can relate to on some level or in some facet.

One thing I absolutely loved about Gone with the Wind is that it doesn't start slow. It gets right into the center of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and portrays her as a selfish, spoiled brat. She loves the well-mannered, Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), a man she cannot have and he will be soon marrying the naive Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). She meets Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) who is far from who Ashley is  he is no gentleman at all but he loves Scarlett, only Scarlett does not have the same love for him as she does for Ashley. Every character in this film is memorable, even Mammy (Hattie McDaniel), the black woman who is loyal the O'Hara household. Even though the DVD edition of the film is roughly 3hrs and 58mins long, time goes fast when you're actually watching a good movie. This is what romances are all about: It doesn't matter if you don't have explicit love scenes, all that matters are characters that are true to the story itself.",

It cut out so much important from the book and included all the minor details. And all the good lines were changed, and the actors don't look like their characters at all! Viven Leigh does not even remotely look like what Margaret Mitchell described Scarlett to be. Her eyes aren't even green! And Clark Gable DOES NOT look a bit like Rhett Butler. He's too kind to Scarlett. Rhett is supposed to be sarcastic and disliked. That's what makes the whole thing fun. He finds something to laugh about (even if its not right to laugh about) and makes Scarlett laugh too. And the other actors were good as actors, but not as who they were supposed to be. The movie cut out a lot of scenes when Scarlett arrives in Atlanta, and it gets rid of all of Wade's early scenes and Melanie isn't even pregnant when she's supposed to be! These scenes were probably cut out because they didn't have Rhett in them, but its not Rhett's movie! Clark Gable's role can't be made into a leading one when its not! Rhett Butler is a supporting role and Scarlett is supposed to be the star, but in the movie almost all of Scarlett's scenes without Rhett are cut out.

The acting is great for the parts, because after the first fifteen minutes you start imagining Scarlett O'hara not as Vivian Leigh, but as Scarlett O'Hara, jealous, and selfish. The same thing happens with the other characters, actors, and actresses dissapear, and the characters come in. The directing, producing, and writing is fantastic. First of all by picking the actors and actresses, second of all by taking the chance of practically putting the whole book in the movie (not the whole book, but most of it) the writing is fantastic because not many movies have been adapted like this, and I think this is the first of it's time to have each scene actually mean something. Another thing is that rarely a commercially succesfull movie is great. This is also the first epic of it's time (maybe second but close to first) and not many people have done a movie like this. Also it was a great idea to keep the audience waiting three years, that's a tip for producers who are reading this, make them waiting a long, long, long time for a great movie, then you'll get big box office money. The story is fantastic showing a young girl, selfish, jealous, of everyone who has a man, then she becomes nice, and carefull when she's poor, but once she's rich again, she's back to her selfish, and jealous self. Then at the end with nothing left, no daughter, no son, no husband, nobody to love, she see's what she has to do go back to Tara, the place where she lived her childhood, and had a great time, the place where she got through the civil war, the place with her memories in it, the place that she loves.",
694,7 July 2016,kittyritig,7, A long watch...,"One of the longest movies I have watched. It was like diving into another world or a lot similar to time traveling. If you are not a fan of long duration movies like me, it will be very difficult to finish in one sitting. And the background music that never seems to stop makes it barely tolerable. But the annoying need of 'to know how it ends' kept me going and in one sitting! Now thinking back I'm glad that I did so. Even though the story description says about a girl so spoiled I see it differently. Maybe because I belong to the twenty first century where we witness much worse levels of ""spoiledness"". A girl with limited span of experience trying to survive and thrive in the physical and emotional conflicts that follow afterwards in the best way she thinks she is capable of. Nevertheless the character Scarlett; the protagonist is not easy to like or to approve. Yet she is interesting to observe and comical in more than one occasion. The gorgeous Viviane Leigh portrays her perfectly. And in the end she comes to a stage where anyone will come after such a hard journey disregard of the defeat or the victory that they might experience. It's a wonderful story yet we are so accustomed to everything fast delivered it's prone to get boring and tempting to walk away.

695,27 June 2005,songbird2882,7, A golden age of cinema masterpiece,"There is nothing more wonderful than a sweeping romance from the 30's or 40's. Better still in Southern Belle costumes and fakey Southern accents. Some people find fault that Clarke Gable fails to deliver his Southern drawl, and that Vivien Leigh's is decidedly English (her native country) but I find it unimportant. This is a movie that today people sneer at, think it's cheesy and fake and overblown but in the end, if you let yourself get carried into the emotion, you're in for a treat that's seldom experienced. There's nothing I like better than the soaring music, full-scale orchestra like all old films, and the dramatic lighting changes. Olivia de Havilland's acting never ceases to amaze me and I study every flicker in her face and eyes. She is an incredible actress, and is still radiant today. Vivien Leigh overtakes Scarlett, takes Mitchell's character, portrays her well, and gives us more to Scarlett than an empty head, greed and flirtatious airs. Leigh makes Scarlett human, and viewers identify with not only the protagonist, but the three supporting roles as well. We see bits of ourselves in Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, and Ashley and at the same time love and hate them for it. The same goes for the movie. There are mistakes surely, which we correct in our mind, but it adds to the charm of this classic, that it's flawed and loved because of it, just like its heroine, and just like humanity, which Mitchell and Selznick so well portray, and we still embody today.",
696,16 April 1999,sabby,10, Supreme epic of lust and passion!,"I put off seeing ""Gone With the Wind"" for a long time, because I thought, ""Who cares about some Civil War epic?"" Well, when I reluctantly sat down to watch it, I soon became mesmerized by the passion of this movie. My second favorite film of all time (only behind 1959's ""Imitation of Life""), this is supreme epic drama. What an amazing work this is! Scarlett (Vivien Leigh) is a pain-in-the-butt spoiled brat who loves Ashely (Leslie Howard), but Ashley loves his cousin Melanie(Olivia De Havilland). Ashley leaves Scarlett to care for Melanie(whom Scarlett despises)when he goes off to war. Enter the heroic Rhett(Clark Gable)who saves Scarlett and Melanie from a burning Atlanta. Rhett begins to find Scarlett attractive in a strange sort of way. Tragedy soon unfolds for everyone in this film. Your tears will flow and you,too, will fall in love with this picture! Plus, Olivia De Havilland, perhaps out most underrated performer, is the real stand-out in this cast.",

Because like others i watch movie according to my Mood. But after watching this movie i got shocked, that how come its in IMDb top list. It wasted my precious 4 hours of my life. i was so disappointed, though the direction, the acting, the screen play was good. but there wasn't any need of stretching the story for FOUR Hours.

There is the beauty of love, the agony of war, the glimmer of hope, not to mention the lush portrait of the old south. Vivien Leigh was adorable as the spoiled and outgoing Scarlett O'Hara. Clark Gable was wonderful as the cold ex-POW Rhett Butler. My favorite character however, was Hattie McDonald as Mammy. She was great!  I suggest that everybody see this movie.

Having seen most of the movies in the Top 250, I can safely say that Gone with the Wind belongs in the top 10, if not in the top 5 or 3. It is a classic, and 70 years later I feel that it has not aged the slightest bit. Modern movies with their flashy special effects will never equal the subtle emotion and vivid storyline of Gone with the Wind. The acting is superb, especially Hattie McDaniel's convincing portrayal of Mammy, Olivia DeHavilland as the compassionate and reserved Melanie, and of course, Vivien Leigh's emotional and brilliant Scarlett O'Hara. The bottom line? Watch this movie, and watch it again. When you have, and you haved loved it (as I am sure you will) come and rate it on IMDb, and maybe it can get the ranking it deserves.",

During the work on the tape, Sam Wood, George Cukor and Victor Fleming managed to visit the director's chair, and although the first two do not appear in the credits, this does not detract from their contribution to the creation of the overall canvas.

Besides, it really had nothing to do with wind or the civil war. People, don't watch it because it's so popular and because of the dumb line at the end. Please don't waste your life watching this!

The acting is over the top, and by that I mean High School theater-like. Clark Gable seems like he wishes he was somewhere else during his scenes, very distant. Vivien Leigh's performance was as dull(two dimensional) as dull can be. Reminded me of Madonna in Evita. The background landscape imagery was a real distraction. Looked like they did scenes in front of a motion picture screen. I guess they couldn't afford to do location shots. The lighting is terrible, indoor and outdoor scenes. The cinematography was mediocre at best. Not much happens during the 3 plus hours, that could have been covered in 1 hour. I most definitely won't be watching this movie ever again.",

To that degree it's unique and exceptional and worth watching 100%. But the main character is intolerable. Selfish, stubborn, childish, and unwilling to change. So don't get your hopes up. In a 4 hour movie in which you watch Scarlet go through all sorts of challenges and suffering (with the civil war a small backdrop comparatively) you think ""surely she must grow into a better woman!"" But no. Why make an epic movie with such a loser as the lead? She might be ""strong"" and ""independent"" but in the most childish and selfish ways. That's not admirable nor attractive.

The plot of the beautiful but headstrong Scarlett O'Hara lusting after the handsome young Ashley Wilkes, even after he marries, would be interesting on its own.  Throw in the chaos caused by the war and you have one rip-roaring story.  Turn Scarlett's real personal tragedy into a justification for treating everyone else like dirt and you have one of the best movies of all time, with the famous ending just being the coup de grace for Scarlett ignoring her own feelings all along in favour of avarice.  If you've never seen this film, do yourself a favour and put aside the three and a half hours - you won't regret it.

Scarlett O'Hara is the greatest female character of our heritage.  Who else comes close?",
712,13 September 2010,frncsbrennan,10, One of the all time greats,"There are racist elements to this movie, because this was a racist time period in America, especially in the South. Not only was the South racist in 1863 but was also in 1936. It would be untruthful to depict it otherwise. Though Hattie McDaniel's role as Mammy was groundbreaking, earning the first Oscar for an African-American actor. And, interestingly, the way Hattie played her role, she was no door mat. She continually stood up to Scarlett and often put her in her place, and she often seemed like she was the only one who had any common sense in the film. Mammy even put Ward Bond in his place. Butterfly McQueen's role as Prissy is very hard to take. But she herself, in later life, said that she was glad she took the role, even though she didn't feel that way at the time. That being said, Gone With the Wind is still a great movie, an epic. Clark Gable had completely perfected his on-screen persona by this film; he was a wise cracking, clever, tough, devil -may-care man who really sort of did care, but just didn't want to let others know that side of himself. Vivian Leigh was amazing-although British, she perfectly captured Scarlett, the head-strong, spoiled and devilish Southern Belle. The whole acting was good all the way around; Howard and De Havilland lend good support. The burning of Atlanta is the climactic scene, along with Gable's movie ending line.",
713,4 May 2019,josephkinion,9, Best Picture winner for (1939),"On the eve of the American Civil War in 1861, Scarlett O'Hara lives at Tara, her family's cotton plantation in Georgia, with her parents and two sisters and their many slaves. Scarlett learns that Ashley Wilkes-whom she secretly loves-is to be married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, and the engagement is to be announced the next day at a barbecue at Ashley's home, the nearby plantation Twelve Oaks.
At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett privately declares her feelings to Ashley, but he rebuffs her by responding that he and Melanie are more compatible. Scarlett is incensed when she discovers another guest, Rhett Butler, has overheard their conversation. The barbecue is disrupted by the declaration of war and the men rush to enlist. As Scarlett watches Ashley kiss Melanie goodbye, Melanie's younger brother Charles proposes to her. Although she does not love him, Scarlett consents and they are married before he leaves to fight.Scarlett is widowed when Charles dies from a bout of pneumonia and measles while serving in the Confederate Army. Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in Atlanta to cheer her up, although the O'Haras' outspoken house slave Mammy tells Scarlett she knows she is going there only to wait for Ashley's return. Scarlett, who should not attend a party while in mourning, attends a charity bazaar in Atlanta with Melanie where she meets Rhett again, now a blockade runner for the Confederacy. Celebrating a Confederate victory and to raise money for the Confederate war effort, gentlemen are invited to bid for ladies to dance with them. Rhett makes an inordinately large bid for Scarlett and, to the disapproval of the guests, she agrees to dance with him.
The tide of war turns against the Confederacy after the Battle of Gettysburg in which many of the men of Scarlett's town are killed. Scarlett makes another unsuccessful appeal to Ashley while he is visiting on Christmas furlough, although they do share a private and passionate kiss in the parlor on Christmas Day, just before he returns to war.
Eight months later, as the city is besieged by the Union Army in the Atlanta Campaign, Scarlett and her young house slave Prissy must deliver Melanie's baby without medical assistance after she goes into premature labor. Afterwards, Scarlett calls upon Rhett to take her home to Tara with Melanie, her baby, and Prissy; he collects them in a horse and wagon, but once out of the city chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett and the group to make their own way back to Tara. Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of typhoid fever and her father has become incompetent. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself.As the O'Haras work in the cotton fields, Scarlett's father is killed after he is thrown from his horse in an attempt to chase away a scalawag from his land. With the defeat of the Confederacy, Ashley also returns, but finds he is of little help at Tara. When Scarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and kisses her passionately, but says he cannot leave Melanie. Unable to pay the taxes on Tara implemented by Reconstructionists, Scarlett dupes her younger sister Suellen's fiancé, the middle-aged and wealthy mill owner Frank Kennedy, into marrying her, by saying Suellen got tired of waiting and married another suitor.
Frank, Ashley, Rhett and several other accomplices make a night raid on a shanty town after Scarlett is attacked while driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. With Frank's funeral barely over, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she accepts. They have a daughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett, still pining for Ashley and chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, lets Rhett know that she wants no more children and that they will no longer share a bed.
One day at Frank's mill, Scarlett and Ashley are seen embracing by Ashley's sister, India, and harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett she eagerly spreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett to attend a birthday party for Ashley. Incapable of believing anything bad of her, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side so that all know that she believes the gossip to be false. After returning home from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent to have sex with her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the bedroom. The next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a divorce, which she rejects, saying that it would be a disgrace. When Rhett returns from an extended trip to London, Scarlett informs him that she is pregnant, but an argument ensues which results in her falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a miscarriage. As she is recovering, tragedy strikes when Bonnie dies while attempting to jump a fence with her pony.
Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has suffered complications arising from a new pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett prepares to leave Atlanta. Having realized that it was he she truly loved all along, and not Ashley, Scarlett pleads with Rhett to stay, but Rhett rebuffs her and walks away into the morning fog, leaving her in tears on the staircase, vowing to one day win back his love.",
714,3 March 2005,southerngentleman64462,7, A Great Movie is you can get past its racism,"I have seen ""Gone With the Wind"" three or four times and I appreciate the strength of the story, direction, acting and costumes. Nevertheless, I have problems with Mararget Mitchell's racism and lack of knowledge about African Americans. Mammy who is the main black character seems to exist only to serve white people. Where is her family? Where are her children? These questions remain unanswered. Another flaw is that none of the black characters really seem to be fully dimensional human beings. What are their wants and desires? Historically, many blacks ran away from their slave masters. Others left as soon as the Civil War ended. Few stayed with their former owners. Moreover, the novel and the movie distort Reconstruction. Many of the blacks who served in the legislatures, the House of Representatives, and U.S. Senate were well educated. The country made tremendous progress in racial progress from 1865-1877. Then, it ended with the Hayes Compromise. Gone With the Wind is a fine movie,technically, but inaccurate and racist.",

716,22 May 2003,Mayesgwtw39,10, For Better or Worse: GWTW Remains Critic-proof For All Time,"It is useless to try to sum up or understand the phenomenon that is ""Gone With the Wind"". The film will stand as the greatest most visceral film in the collective heart for all time. It has more real humanity-with all the foibles and charms-than any other motion picture ever made. If there is a single person out there who doesn't understand Scarlett's wanting something so much and never getting it, but letting her life's fortunes be guided by her own ill-conceived hopes, I want to congratulate you on having a dream life. The chemistry of these actors and the truth in their performances is the key to getting us into this world not too far from our own: where the wrong precepts are being taken into battle and the arrogance of war and false ideals is put beyond the value of human life. One may not like all the characters, or even may feel that the actors are more stereotyped and drawn bigger than the low-key performances that are supposed to be more ""real"" seen on the screen today(which are usually just underexpressed and not like real life and its melodramatics at all). In that case, please think back to a time where communication between real people was par for the course and one's sense of drama could be expressed in dialogue in real life... Certainly no one handles this better than the great Vivien Leigh. Her Scarlett is true and perfect at every turn. She is the life force of the film: maddening and monstrous, but desperately yearning and, so, understandable. Gable's performance shows subtlety and timeless vulnerability that make this performance seem more accomplished with each year. DeHavilland places Stanislavsky-like center of energy in her heart like a current-day Method actress. And Leslie Howard agonizingly reaches the tortured soul of someone who is physically attracted to a woman with whom he knows he could never make a relationship work. Beyond that the force of humor and pathos that Hattie McDaniel displays are true and beautiful in their execution. Butterfly McQueen slyly adds gestures and dimensions that may not be as visible until one concentrates on her performance. People have tried to understand or attack the magnetism of this film since its release to no avail. As long as human nature wants what it doesn't have or mourns what it feels it has lost, ""Gone With the Wind"" will be the film that resonates with the disillusionment and hope that we all share and which moves us forward.",

718,15 October 2001,sloopbillyb,5," Sloopbillyb skewers ""Gone with the Wind""","Gone with the Wind is just about the most overrated film I have ever seen. Now, let me tell you why: 1. Scarlett O'Hara is the most dislikable protagonist created in American fiction, not counting Jar Jar Binks.  She is pushy and always wants her way. She is an immature brat.  And this movie makes her out to be some kind of heroine!? 2. Clark Gable has little acting talent in this movie, which disappointed me after seeing him in the hilarious ""It Happened One Night"".  He pretty much smiles and charms his way through the picture, and by the end of the movie you wonder who he is, really.  The movie could have built a kind of mysterious aura about him, like in ""Citizen Kane,"" but nope.  It pretty much assumes you already know him. 3. Every character is a stereotype.  Every single one.  I know this is a common criticism, but just look at it again.  Don't think I'm criticizing Hattie McDaniel, though.  She did wonderful with what little she was offered.  In fact, her performance is the best in the film. 4. Leslie Howard and Olivia de Havilland practically sleepwalk through their parts. 5.  The story is nothing more than a soap opera.  Now mind you, soap operas at least have the decency to have more than one corny, stupid story line so that there's some variety.  In ""Gone with the Wind,"" there is only one story: Scarlet.  Her relationship with Rhett is quite flexible; no more than five minutes pass in the movie when they love each other.  After five minutes, they hate each other.  Another five minutes, they're in love.  With a movie 234 minutes long, that means there is a monotonous love story with, oh let's see, 46.8 twists and turns.  We'll say about 40.  Oh my, isn't that exciting?",
719,20 July 2001,XULILIXU,10, I love this movie!,"Gone With The Wind is so wonderful, it's hard to believe it was made in the 30s. What I like most about this film is that the characters are so real that you think you know them personally. GWTW is about Scarlett O'Hara. She loves Ashley, but Ashley is married to his cousin, Melanie. So she married Melanie's brother Charles( a total loser) in spite. The war started, so the men goes off to fight and Charles died two weeks later. Scarlett moved in with Melanie in Atlanta. She ruined her reputation dancing with Rhett. Then more stuff happened. The plot is quite simple, but the strong characters saves this film along with other things. The music is great, the sceneries are nice, and the costumes are the best. Oh, did I mention that the acting is to near perfection by all the cast?",
720,3 January 2005,instantxkarmaa,10, Gone With the Wind is an A+ film!,"Gone With the Wind is an amazing film especially when considering it debuted in 1939. Clark Gable is powerful as the dashing Rhett Butler, and Vivien Leigh is the perfect Scarlett O'Hara to match his Rhett. The film is centered around Scarlett, an Irish Southern Belle that has every boy in town eating out of her hand and gazing into her always batting eyelashes. She has her eye on the handsome Ashley Wilkes, played by Leslie Howard, yet Ashley has his eye on Melanie, played by the demure Oliva De'Havilland.The film boasts a strong actors, incredible action sequences, and enchanting sets amidst a compelling story of love and the Old South.

Gone with the wind is by far the greatest film ever made and proved by many film lists and so on. The film takes place in the Civil war, the southerners and the Yankees. It shows the affect f the war and how it affected those who lived through it in particular, Scarlett, probably one of the greatest characters in film history. She goes from being a spoilt young woman to a forced to survive hero. She fights and slaves with those around her to keep hold of her plantation 'Tara' and will go to extreme lengths to keep hold of it after the affect of the war. The film is also a major love story mainly between Scarlett, the man she wants so badly, Ashley, and the man who falls for her, millionaire Rhett Butler. By the end of the film Scarlett realises she's been dreaming of something that she never really wanted, but after the many tragedies that occur is it too late for her to keep hold on what she's really been wanting?

Quite simply, whatever one may think of its artistic merits, (and I believe that they are stunning), it takes its place in cinematic history as the most popular film of all time, and all time box-office champion when its earnings are adjusted for inflation. Although the focus of GWTW's sentimentality has become poltically incorrect, the heart of the film remains timeless. It is the tale of Scarlett O'Hara and the conflict between her vain obsession with Ashley Wilkes and charismatic attraction to Rhett Butler set within the context of the American Civil War. The very qualities which enable Scarlett to survive the Civil War and flourish in its aftermath, (her selfish determination, her single-minded obstinacy, her willingness to flout traditional social values), are in fact the very self-destructive aspects of her character which lead to the dissolution of her marriage with Rhett Butler. The audience is subsequently presented with an age-old tragic formula in which one's greatest virtues become their own worst enemies, and the acceptance of responsibility comes just a moment too late. This Aristotelian facet to GWTW unites both halves of the movie, (I've never understood complaints that the second half of the film is inferior to the first due to this unity), and is set within a thrilling framework of astronomic production values. There is an honesty to GWTW, a freshness bound to its lack of naivete. Scenes of amputations, abusive marriages and cynical passions instill it with a stubborn modernity- the film is timeless because the film is honest. Scarlett O'Hara wading through a sea of corpses at the depot, her defiant shadow set against the backdrop of Tara, the burning of Atlanta, Rhett Butler disappearing into the mist, all of these images have ingrained themselves into the American psyche. And of course, Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable and Hattie McDaniel deliver some of the finest, nuanced performances ever set down on film. From its stunning production values to its witty script, it is a towering example of storytelling and refuses to lose its momentum after over three hours in the theatre. Other films come and go. There is only one Gone With the Wind.",

Also there is a book called "" The Wind Done Gone"" it is from the viewpoint of Cinara-Scarett's slave half sister. Her mother is MAMMY and her father Gerald O'Hara.

But, unlike her I don't hold onto something very long because for her it's always Ashley and money! How can she cling onto that measly Ashley instead of Rhett Butler!? Rhett Butler is so perfect and I am so glad he left her at the end! He is willing to do anything for her and he is rich; he gave everything she ever wanted despite being widowed two times and I am talking about the 19th century! And yet, she never returns his feelings until the very end, but Rhett quickly retorts back ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."" So right!

Bella by the end of the Twilight series, is in effect, just another reincarnation of Scarlett, a whiny brat who somehow makes it through all this adversity and ends up with a throng of male followers.

750,6 January 2022,dpit-00215,9, While Not Perfect... It's A Must-Watch!,"The amount of emotion this movie has is simply astounding! First and foremost, all the cast play their roles extremely well and make almost every scene look like it's happening right now in front of you. That immediately makes it a better movie but it's the scenario and of course the budget, with the incredible acting together, that make this movie a pleasure to be watched even to this day and probably forever. The movie does feel like it's split sometimes due to the fact that we go from the American civil war to after it ended. Personally, i usually like movies sticking to one chronological background, but i don't mind it too much in this case since it's done fairly well. Any history geeks out there will also appreciate the authenticity this movie has, for example the historical references to real events and people (like general Lee's surrender) and of course the iconic American civil war soldier uniforms. I really liked the entire plot of the movie and how we got to see what made the protagonist choose the options she did for her life and their consequences, how that evolved, escalated and the conclusion. Although, sometimes the transitions were a little awkward or too fast, but thankfully, it's was not a major problem for me. There were also times where some things felt a bit too much in the scenario, like the protagonist's daughter also dying after all they've been thorough, and the same way as her father did! To be fair, that was probably the point and it reminds me a lot of many ancient Greek tragedies, where things like this tend to happen very often to emphasize the tragedy the main character is being through. As for the ending, while it ends with one of the most iconic catchphrases of all time in a movie ever, i felt it was a little rushed or maybe not enough. I don't mind letting the viewer imagine what happens next after the movie, but i really feel that it should have build up to it a little more. Let's also mention the fact that this movie is coloured and was made in 1939. In conclusion, while it's a really old movie, the amazing synergy of amazing acting, cinematography and budget (which allowed the movie to also look beutiful) makes it in my opinion a must-watch. A true classic, and a really good one as well!",

780,30 August 2002,corusca,10," Wonderful movie, a complete classic. Not quite up to the book, but wonderful none-the-less.","Gone With The Wind is definitely a classic film, with an amazing cast from Cammie King (Bonnie) to Clark Gable (Rhett). The acting is absolutely incredible, brought together by the amazingly talented Vivien Leigh (Scarlett). They-with perhaps the exception of Leslie Howard as Ashley-brought new life to the characters, giving more depth to them than any modern actor or actress ever could, especially in the given timeframe. The music and amazing cinematography are breathtaking, creating such classic scenes as the field of wounded soldiers, and the infamous 'frankly my dear...' scene- a ground-breaking scene in and of itself, as it was the first time an actor swore on-screen. For a movie compacting twelve years into four hours, it is incredible. However, in contrast to the book you will find that many scenes, important to understanding the characters-Scarlett in particular-were left out, in favor of building up the rather detestable character of Rhett Butler. As well as leaving out two very important players in Scarlett's life-her two eldest children, Wade Hamilton and Ella Kennedy. Scarlett's feelings are often cheapened, leaving the viewer to think she is simply a selfish bitch, instead of a spoiled child trying to survive in a world that was suddenly cold and unforgiving, where her only friends are a woman she despises, the married man she loves, and a man who cuts her down at every opportunity. The film's saving grace is in the abilities of Vivien Leigh, as she managed to give life and depth to Scarlett that I cannot imagine any other actress capturing, then or now. Perhaps if there had been more time it could have been more true to the novel, but as it is it remains a classic. This movie will forever be my favorite, and it pains me to know we will never be able to recapture the magic that was Gone With The Wind.",

Technicolor is used to the point that it glorifies the picture more, but it doesn't fall in the way of the story. Also, ""Gone with the Wind"" is BIG, running five minutes shy of four hours, winning 10 Academy Awards, and constantly placing easily in the top 5 or 10 of the greatest films lists.

The Technicolor photography is magnificent, and Max Steiner's score is truly unforgettable.  We now associate Scarlett with the incredibly beautiful Vivien Leigh and Rhett with Gable.

It has everything that can capture a person's imagination. Drama, action, romance and at times humor is included in this epic and I would just like to express my deep love for this movie. So you might say I'm just one of the millions of hopeless romantics out there, looking for my own Rhett Butler, but I would just like to point out that I've seen this movie for what it really is, along with its mistakes and it is safe for me to say that it's one of the best, if not the greatest production Hollywood has ever made.

I've watched this movie at least 10 times, and definitely have the video in my collection.

She is so kind that she can even appreciate the brutal trait in Scarlett's body. She took the gun with her when Yankee broke into the house, which even surprised Scarlett. From the realistic perspective, people tend to like Scarlett, which is quite understandable, cause she is so real and tough, and snobbish for the most of the time. That's what human do in a struggling situation. But, just because we can't find a person like Melanie in the real world, we love her more than Scarlett. In my view, the deep connection between this two greatest female is still a little bit stuffless. It would be much more better if the director could show the interactions between two females.",
820,13 August 2006,croneruk,10, A Film to be seen Again and Again,"This is an excellent film very true to the original book. It gives a good picture of this period in history of the USA during the civil war. The way people with money and power carried out their lives. Servants, cotton pickers, grooms, cooks, maids, nannies, butlers etc waiting on them. The slowness and peacefulness with regard to no noisy aeroplanes, cars, lorries etc. Just the quite countryside with the sounds of horses, birds, cattle and other creatures. It is a good example of the destruction of war and the changes to their lives that were made. I think a follow-on film would be a good idea in the future, it should be of high quality and greatness to match this film.",

I think there is a generational gap between those that like it and those that do not. The movie can not be judged on todays standards and be considered very good. To compare it to soaps is very unfair since there were no soaps back then. Today if there is not full unabated action every minute, the movie is said to have slow periods. That is a sign of the times. I did not see this movie until the early 50's when I lived in Laredo, Texas. It took that long for it to get down there. For it's time, it was a very gritty movie and very close to the first movie I ever say in color. It gets a 10/10 from me. It is a lot better than some of the trash getting awards today.",
822,7 June 2012,rozochkamglamyan,10, The most magnificent picture ever!!!,"""Gone With the Wind"" is a beautiful romance film, directed by David Selznick. It is an amazing film adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's immortal novel. ""Gone With the Wind"" is film epic describing the events of the Civil War and subsequent years. The film based on the history of the beautiful, selfless love, confrontation between two lovers, who don't want to sacrifice their pride and open up their feelings to each other. The main characters are Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes and Melanie Hamilton. Scarlett was played by Vivien Leigh, Rhett by Clark Gable, Ashley by Leslie Howard, and Melanie by Olivia de Havilland. Scarlett is in love with Ashley since childhood, she loves him devotedly and selflessly. She saves Melanie (Ashley's wife) and her son, cares for them, in spite of her own feelings. Scarlett builds her life against all customs and traditions. The values formed since childhoods are transformed into new. She understands it's impossible to return old world with old ideals and values, but it's possible to build a new life. Scarlett pursue the dream of Ashley, unaware that her happiness is very close. Rhett Butler is a man with scandalous reputation. He loves Scarlett, but disguises his feelings, because he was afraid to be rejected. Rhett is a representative of the new era, he sees the sough is doomed, watching the collapse of the old world, but he doesn't build any illusions and believes in new life. This film is well worth seeing. There are a lot of memorable moments: farewell of Rhett and Scarlett on the eve of the collapse of Atlanta, hospital, Rhett's proposal, the death of Melanie and Bony, an open end. Film is striking: breads of depicted life, a beautiful love story, wonderful pictures of nature, pathetic music, and unforgettable end!!! This is a very exciting film. The acting is above all praise! ""Gone With the Wind"" is the most magnificent picture ever!",
823,10 June 2012,joylynncraft,10, Taking care of Family or Taking Care of Self: What was Scarlett's real motivation?,"I am currently a student taking a course in The Art of Film at a community college in Dayton, Ohio. One of the assignments is to write a post or add to a post of a movie of our choice. I chose Gone with the Wind because it has to be one of my favorite movies. Katie ""Scarlett"" O'Hara-Hamilton-Kennedy-Butler has to be one of the best female roles in film to me. When she is depicted before the Civil War, she is immediately shown with two beaus at her house on a beautiful summer's day. When the two young men start speaking of war she explains that talk of war bores her. As the two beaus continue to ask about war, Scarlett begins to retreat into the house. The men suddenly come to their senses and apologize, while saying they will not talk about war anymore. It is here we see Scarlett does get her way. As they change the subject to the barbecue at the Wilkes', a neighbor's plantation, she is stunned to find out that the love of life is marrying his cousin (just have to add that I am glad people do not do that anymore)! Scarlett immediately storms off in anger and confusion, wondering how that could be if Ashley, her crush, loves her. While storming off she is told by her ""Mammy"" that it was rude to leave the company standing there without asking them to stay for dinner and that she needs a shawl on her shoulders if she is going to be out in the evening. Scarlett yells back that she is waiting for her father to get home from the Wilkes', to get the inside information on what is really going on. The movie takes place in the south, before, during, and after the Civil War era, when slavery was the largest problem of the United States. To Scarlett, war was a stupid problem that she never wanted to talk about; she was happy having every beau in the county sit next to her at a barbecue and drool all over her. Even though her love for Ashley never wavered, she married three men throughout her life as a means to survive. I do not think she was just trying to survive for herself, I think she showed that she had heart and truly cared for her family when she married Frank Kennedy. Knowing that Frank was Suellen's beau, I think she figured once Suellen and Frank were married that they would leave and would no longer have to worry about Tara and the rest of the family. Therefore, Scarlett married Frank and paid the taxes on Tara so the family would have a home. A selfish person would not have done that, a person with no morals might have.",

826,17 December 2004,mammysgirlygirl,10, Gable should have gotten the Academy Award for this one....,"I first saw GWTW at an early age and remembered that I thought Gable looked like an old man and why would anyone be attracted to him -- HA! I am now in my thirties, and this is my favorite movie of all time. I have seen, read about, and seriously dreamed about this movie for some time. I have seen it aleast 50-75 times and I can find no flaws. From casting, which is incredible and impossible to imagine any of the main characters being played by anyone else, to filming, which if you get the new 4 DVD set out you will see just how incredible it was to film this movie, I find absolutely no flaws with this spectacular movie. The storyline is, as is should be, written for word, right out of Mitchell's book. I do admit that the book is incredible and some of the storyline I wish had made it into the movie, ie. Scarlett's children. I would have liked to have seen her in the early mother role with a son that could barely speak his own name he was so timid of her! Back to the movie...if you are of southern descent and you have not seen this movie, someone should spank you! If you are northern and not seen this movie, then you should so you know how most of the south still feels about you. I have yet to met a northerner that was not 'out of the norm' of this movie. It pegs them to a tee! (And I've met plenty!) A movie with a wonderful story, wonderful scenery and a wonderful cast! I, too, do not believe that there was an American actress at that time that could have surpassed Leigh's performance. She is truly magnificent. My favorite line of her's is when ole Kennedy has died and she has been drinking brandy and Rhett comes to call on her and she see's him out her window and hiccups and say ""It's Rhett"". And then pretties herself up with cologne with Rhett smells right away and says "" Scarlett, you should never drink alone, people aways find out and it ruins their reputation!"" So true and yet so funny! The movie is wonderful, beginning to end, and if you haven't seen it, it's at least worth a Sunday afternoon of your time. Beautifully filmed, beautifully portrayed. My 8 year son now knows just about every line, he's loves this movie. His favorite line is when Mammie is putting Mr. Kennedy pants in the ""boilin' pot"", he doubles over every time he hears her say that. Yes, I know some black people believe this is a racist film and I'm sorry they feel that way. I don't take it upon myself to say it is or it isn't but that's the way it was only 'glorified'. I think ALL Americans should all be proud of the performances and at least HATTIE was given the first 'Supporting Actress Award"" for a black performer. She was excellent! NO ONE could have made a better performance. If you do research on the time she spent on GWTW you will get a good perspective of what she thought of the role and what she wanted to bring to the picture. My only disappoint was that Clark Gable did not receive an Academy Award for this picture...he was so good that everyone thought he wasn't really acting, he was just himself. I am a die-hard GABLE fan, and, yes, this part was made for him but he still had to act the part. I still believe he was robbed!! Studio would not let him get the Academy Award! That sucked!If you are not a Gable fan, please check out some of his other flics! He is still the best of the BEST! But if you are still here for GWTW , don't miss the opportunity to see the best picture of all time!And it is, it truly is!!",

830,29 January 2015,shianne490,7, My personal opinion of the movie,"Although this epic romantic melodrama is undoubtedly one of the most popular and beloved motion pictures ever to grace the silver screen, it is also arguably the most overrated. Gone with the Wind is a very good movie, perhaps bordering on being great, but its subject matter and running time. Gone with the Wind is, simply put, a tale of two halves. The movie is divided by an intermission into a pair of roughly-equal segments. Then first, which is brilliant and consistently captivating, covers the time period of the Civil War, ending during Sherman's march through Atlanta. The post-intermission half, which dishes out the suds, picks up at the end of the Civil War and concludes about eight years later. This portion of Gone with the Wind, spins its wheels frequently. Theatrically, Gone with the Wind is an entirely different experience from its small-screen counterpart; some of the second-half narrative tedium is effaced by the glorious visuals. With a restored three- strip. Gone with the Wind has one of the best-known story lines of any film. Is Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), the spoiled, manipulative daughter of an Irish immigrant plantation owner (Thomas Mitchell). Scarlett has two sisters, but she is by far the most spirited of the three O'Hara girls, and her father, seeing her as his successor, teaches her lessons about the importance of the land. Scarlett is secretly in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), who is about to marry the gentle, demure Melanie Hamilton (Olivia De Havilland). When Scarlett confesses her love to Ashley, he admits his feelings for her, but notes that Melanie will make a much better wife. Immediately after this meeting, Scarlett has her first encounter with the irrepressible Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), the cynical, smart hero who eventually falls in love with her. They are two headstrong likes who simultaneously repel and attract one another. Ultimately, when Rhett has finally had enough, he walks out of her life to her plaintive query about what she's supposed to do without him. The pre-intermission portion of Gone with the Wind, which runs about 115 minutes, is glorious from both a visual and an emotional standpoint. It's a grand tale of love and loss in the midst of this country's most bitter war. Most importantly, it shows Scarlett's development from a vain, spoiled brat into a hardened, determined young woman. Her relationship with Rhett is there, but kept carefully in the background. There is sadness, humor, and a number of breathtaking shots of Scarlett silhouetted against a reddish sunset. Gone with the Wind stands as a romantic monument to the Old South -- an homage to an era and a lifestyle long gone. To date, no film has sold more box-office tickets than Gone with the Wind. Domestically, the tally almost doubles that for the phenomenally-popular Titanic. Of course, when the movie was first released, it wasn't just another motion picture -- it was a spectacle, an event. Even though the habits of movie- goers have changed over the years, it's easy to see why this film provoked such an outpouring of praise and adulation during its initial release, and why its stature has grown with the passage of decades. Gone with the Wind has flaws, but it's still undeniably a classic and a legend.",

""Gone With the Wind"" completed me when I watched it. Clark Gable is very beautiful as well, which makes the movie so much more enjoyable. Following Scarlett through her life, we start at the beginning of the Civil War. With the theme of sacrifice and love, it makes it a wonderful classic. The love between Rhett and Scarlett is one that I can only imagine; the beauty is unforgettable and indescribable. If you are having questions about whether to watch this movie, take them back and forget about it. Watch the movie, you will be changed! I highly recommend it to anyone yearning to see a spectacular film.",

I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves classic movies like me. I'm fourteen, and it's so weird.And Scarlett has become my favorite character, alongside with Rhett and everybody else.

Classic movie like this should be watched forever and ever.Melanie is so sweet and that she is so nice and sweet. Ashley is OK, but I don't get him sometimes.",
