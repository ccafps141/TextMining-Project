2,6 August 2015,vishaal811,10, A Cinematic Masterpiece!!,"What are the necessary requirements for making a good movie? I guess strong acting, realistic judgments made by characters, complementary music and tight pacing are essential elements in achieving this. In all these departments, Drishyam stands head and shoulders over every other Bollywood movie that has come out in this year. Even though it is a remake of a Malyalam movie, there is no loss of quality and it delivered emphatically.",e
3,31 July 2015,SAMTHEBESTEST,8, Its Shawshank Redemption in bollywood. A masterpiece. The best south remake ever made in bollywood.,"DRISHYAM REVIEW- Hell yeah, just watched the Masterpiece, gem of thriller. Wow is the only word is in mouth now for this movie. Heard a remake of national award Malayalam movie is coming in bollywood and i was just waiting like anything for this movie. Trailer didn't offered much but it was promising. Then critics reviews came which took my expectations to sky level. And finally after watching it i must say movie worths it. A rare thriller which was made to look realistic only not as filmy masala content. First half takes time to set platform, sets movie plot then 2nd half blows you away with its masterclass planning and scenes. A simple plot, a common man who is 4th std failed not much educated tries to hide his family's crime from so called educated police officers. But the content and screenplay is so realistic that it makes this simple story a masterpiece. Even a Long runtime of 2 hrs 40 mins looks too tight and glues us to Our seat. Writer has done an extraordinary job, people will not forget this story in lifetime. Kudos to him and screenplay maker . Music wasn't much needed for movie,still 1 song after interval is situational which plays important role to make scene much tight. Entire star cast acted like real incident and really made me feel that its all happening in real in front of me. Ajay devgn the man who is the soul of this movie. His acting is just out of the world. Those intense eyes, innocent expressions, scary scenes and some emotional scenes as if this movie made for his acting only. Surely best performance of the year till date and i don't think someone will give better performance than him in this year at least, he deserves an award for this movie. Tabbu role is exactly half to Ajay according to runtime of movie. She did whatever expected from her role. Other star cast did fab job, each and every actor gave his best for their roles. Director Nishikant Kamat proves his skills and talent metal again here. He never left movie's grip till the end. Even the last ending scene of the movie was watchable and gives goosebumps. Hats off to him. He already had remake in hand which made direction much easier so there was no chance to make movie a crap. Overall a must watch for all. Only kids wont understand it, but other audience like classes, masses, youngsters and even seniors will love it. Go for this one, take 3 hrs from your life and enjoy the rare and the best thriller ever made in bollywood. Don't miss, you cant afford to miss this masterpiece. Here we have got the best movie of 2015. Last line, 'Its like,'Shawshank Redemption in bollywood. 9/10 * stars by me :)",v

5,31 July 2015,chillax_amit1986,10, Family Drama With an Exciting thrill,"As everyone is aware it is a remake and the movies made before are exceptional. So, definitely the expectations would be high at least by the people who have seen it.",e
6,30 July 2015,anupapu8,8, Exceptional Piece of Writing,"Drishyam- Less are the cases present in any film industry where a film is made with brilliant piece of writing (By Jeethu Joshep in case of this movie)and every other thing just revolve around it. Drishyam was one of those cases. One thing i would like to clear before you watch the movie is that this is not a suspense movie. It has been wrongly promoted same as happened in case of Aamir Khan's TALAASH. But yes its a part family movie and a part thriller. From the very start culprit will be in front of your eyes , but its hard to prove. Its all about how deep the truth has been dumped and how difficult its gonna be dig it out. To say about the plot will ruin the movie. Like the trailer shows Vijay(Ajay) is a very good man , with a golden heart , but somehow his family is being caught by the police to prove that they have kidnapped the son of Meera Deshmukh (Tabu) a cop. After that starts a thrilling ride in which Meera want evidence to prove Vijay and his family guilty , and Vijay will do anything to save his family as he say - ""EK INSAAN KE LIYE USKI FAMILY HI SABKUCH HOTI HEI AUR UNHE BACHANE KE LIYE WO KISI BHI HADD TAK JA SAKTA HEI"". The character of Vijay literally lived up to this quote of himself . But the movies seeks for your patience . The first half up to the crime happens was a little too stretchy. Length of 2hr and 43min for a thriller is too long. Some editing was needed on the first half. Although i personally didn't find anything boring , as it was good with light moments , making base for title characters , some good humour and a nicely picturized song CARBON COPY. Still its true that some editing could have made it better. Its like a tasty cake has been made but the Cherry was missing. But wait , the cherry has been provided by the 2nd half. For me which compensate all the minor errors of first half. You couldn't imagine how the writer has managed to write such a plot with so much details of investigation and specially the interrogations. This movie has some of the best interrogation scenes which Bollywood haven't shown us till now. Nishikant Kamat is one hell of a director. His land marks includes 1. making movies in 3 languages 2. have directed the highest grossing Marathi film. 3. Is very good with remakes - first FORCE and now this one. 4. Lastly he can dig out acting out of John Abraham. And any director who can make John Abraham act , is a great director for me. Nisikant truly amazes me with showing how good he can control intense scenes. Ajay Devgan shines again in a serious role. He brings all the seriousness to the character and also provide some comic moments on the first half. The character he played has made some decisions with ethical difficulties , which could be right from someone's eyes and can also be wrong in someone else's view. Vijay makes us believe that his decisions were right for the situation and any person would have done such things for safe guarding his family. About Tabu , she is one of the greatest actress Bollywood have. She doesn't have any comparison . Only rivalry she had or have or will have is she herself. As cop she was tough , and you cant imagine how tough she was. You have to watch it to know how she mixes up her emotions of being the mother of the victim with the emotions of a tough cop who is investigating the same case. About Shreya Saran , i love her smile. And i missed that smile since i had seen her in Awarapan. Although she didn't get much of the meaty role but she was decent as Ajay's wife. Same goes for Rajat Kapoor as Tabu's husband. Some unique cinematography has been done , as the movie shows Goa not from a tourist point of view but from a resident's point of view. Vishal Bhardawaj as music director was OK as he doesn't get much chance to impose good songs in the movie but the background score by Sameer Phatarpekar was brilliant. Yes i have to cut some marks for a stretchy first half , but m going with 7.7/10 which is not bad at all. The thing i said for PIKU i would like to repeat for this is that there exist no reasons why should anyone not watch this movie except in case you have seen the original one. Just one request , DON'T EXPECT ANY SUSPENSE , be patient and FLOW WITH THE INTENSITY. By ANuP APu KuMaR.",w
7,31 July 2015,vimarshmunsif,9," Drishyam :- Sheer Class and excellence, this is it","Well, visuals can indeed be deceptive. When the maker knows what he wants to present, you know you are in for an absolute treat. And for the ones who haven't seen the South Indian make of this movie, like me, are in for a masterpiece. ",/
8,30 July 2015,ankul17,8, Drishyam: A Perfect movie for ending my tiring Thursday,"Just came back from the Premier Screening of Drishyam. The reason for me to catch the movie was the reviews of the original Drishyam which is a Malyalam movie with Mohanlal as the lead actor. The trailers of this Hindi remake with powerful existence of Ajay Devgan (or Devgn, as he writes it now) and Tabu, motivated me to go for this movie after a tiring Thursday in office, (mentioning the tiring day as disappointment was the last this I was willing to accept after the day, Glad I chose this movie). So the movie starts with a small happy family of Vishal Salgaonkar which is living happily in the ever happy town of Goa, there family was disrupted because of an unwanted person entering into their lives who happens to be the son of the Inspector general of Goa, Meera Deshmukh, then an accident happens which changes the life of this family for ever. The way this 4th grade failed person (Vishal) plays with the police department is commendable. So the movie is about how actually Vishal safeguard his family and himself against powerful Meera and her Police Department.",r

11,25 January 2020,Vartiainen,7, One can learn surprising things from movies,"Drishyam, literally meaning 'visuals', is a Hindi-language crime mystery thriller about a upper middle-class family that comes under the scrutiny of police when they're suspected of murder of a young man who has powerful ties with the local authorities. Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn), the father, must do everything he can to keep his family from going to prison, utilizing every legal and illegal trick he has learned as a lifelong movie buff.",3
12,22 August 2015,moosasyed101,10," one the best bollywood movie, story wise","Where do I start? I am speechless literally; when the movie started I thought in first 10-15 minutes, that it was just another Ajay Devgan flick with Police & Stuff. As later on the story took a 180 turn and started escalation from interesting to the whole new level of awesomeness and interest. I don't care if its a copied version of some movie or not, but hats off to the writer/screen writer! Acting was top notch from all characters, not even a single one, whether a big famous actor, or side roll; small time actors; everyone acted to the nearest of perfection. My best movie so far, story wise. Literally it blew off 3 Idiots, PK, Bajrangi etc. from my top lists A must watch...",2
13,2 August 2016,bobbysing,6," Many might like it who haven't seen the original, but as a remake, its the weakest one till date, missing the much needed soul, energy and fire.","With all honesty, the Hindi version of DRISHYAM gives me no energy to write about it in details being the weakest 4th remake of the original Malayalam film featuring Mohan Lal in the lead.

14,1 August 2015,rajat_srvstv,8, This visual is DEEPLY DECEPTIVE,"If you thought Ajay Devgan and Tabu's riveting performances would be a reason sufficient enough to watch this movie,then let me tell you.It is the film's story which wins in the end. First half is lose and needs editing,however the second half doesn't let you even move your eyeballs off the screen. Shriya Saran is good in looks n below average in acting.Both her daughters look convincing and act decently well. The story keeps you glued till the last frame,and the last 1 minute of conclusion gives you goosebumps and deserves claps.Intense,engaging,sharp and an intelligent thriller.This visual is DEEPLY DECEPTIVE.",9

18,14 September 2021,briancham1994,7, Intelligent but tiresome,"This film's entire conceit lies in the plots between the protagonist's family and the corrupt police force. The sneaky cat-and-mouse game stretches them to their limits as they attempt to outmaneuver each other in more and more daring ways. The schemes are intelligent and demand close viewing, as more is revealed gradually throughout the film, culminating in surprising plot twists near the end. However, the film relies too much on revealing the family's scheme and it gets tiresome to watch the same thing over and over - how many times can I see someone buying ""pav bhaji"" to get receipts? The characters seem to fulfil only the most basic archetypes - stoic family man, brutally corrupt cop, weeping wife, evil stalker (who, by the way, was too dumb to live) and so on. Although the film had good points, its runtime leaned too heavily on the same clever schemes at the expense of character development and other necessities.",?
19,17 December 2015,silvan-desouza,5, Scene to scene copy of original,"Drishyam was first made in Malyalam and then recently it was made in Tamil as Papanasam and in Telugu and other languages as well. Director is Nishikant Kamat who gave us Mumbai Meri Jaan(2008) and FORCE(remake of Kaakha Kaakha) The film almost just replicates the original Drishyam almost scene to scene with a few minor changes, like the religion In the original Mohanlal was a catholic, here Ajay is a hindu(thankfully no artificial catholic character), Also in place of going for a retreat there go for a Ashram trip. The film is set in Goa, thankfully no focus on beaches and bars.etc yet there are some stereotypes like the character of Martin who runs Martins corner, he offers the cop a beer at breakfast. But this can be ignored. the film keeps you on the edge though it does lag behind compared to the original yet it is watchable",r
20,4 April 2021,DogePelis2015,10, DRAMA AND SUSPENSE,It is an excellent film from India; it has good acting and a suspenseful plot. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!,e
21,7 March 2021,cs_rahul_kumar,10, Absolutely Top Class !!!,"Expectations were very high after watching the original movie but after seeing this I am 100 percent sure that none other than Ajay Devgn could justify the role of Mohanlal Sir as he did in the original one. This is pure class of acting superbly led by Ajay Devgn, Tabu, Shriya Sharan and others. This is one of the finest remakes ever made in Bollywood Cinema. Ajay Devgn as Vijay Salgaonkar and Tabu as IG Meera Deshmukh as just terrific in there respective characters.",f
22,7 August 2015,maulin5,9," Mindblowing Experience, Thrill it!","A extremely very well written thriller movie, based on Tamil movie, which was also remade in Malyalam and now in Hindi, featuring Ajay Devgn, Shriya Sharan and Tabu in the lead. How far a common man can go to save his family - This is the main storyline. Vijay (Ajay) saves his family from IG Meera Naiar (Tabu) and other policemen. The concept is very fresh and unique. No one can beat the visualization which Ajay's character has. Very well crafted. Director Nishikant Kamat has done a pretty good job. I was seating on the edge of the seat in most of the parts of post interval. He made a very good thriller. Other technical aspects are also good. Music is given by Vishal Bhardwaj. Carbon copy is my favorite from this album, written by Gulzar. Dumb Ghutata Hai is okay. Background score is in the flow of the movie. Actors are really good. Ajay, Tabu, Shriya - all have acted well. Rajat Kapoor has a small role, nothing to offer. When Bahubali and Bajrangi Bhaijaan both are rocking the box-office, it is obvious that only mouth publicity can help this film to survive in the battle. I've heard that this too is going strong. So, July brings the best for all the viewers. Go for it, if you love to watch thriller movie, catchy story and you will surely appreciate it!",_

Talking about the stars:- Ajay is fabulous in the role n I'm happy to see him doing such movies as i was very much disappointed by Action Jackson(It was one of his worst movie after Himmatwala), Tabbu n Shreya has done their part well n in fact everyone in the movie acted so well(including the little girl) that u will feel that everything is happening in real...special mention to Kamlesh Sawant(Inspector Gaitonde) he has done a great job...he was one of the main reason movie looked so interesting...!!

24,9 August 2020,akhilsyngal,10, Mystery unexpected,I have given the rating highly because the fact is what else can you expect from a thriller . The makers did a gambling job to release this film especially in Bollywood & sadly it wasn't a blockbuster . Ajay Devgun a fantastic actor doesn't need to do any dialogue delivery because he is acting through his eyes & Tabu's choices of films is completely wow,t

30,16 May 2016,Moviemanic22,5, Overrated,"Drisyham is a remake of the 2013 south Indian movie of the same name. It starred Mohan Lal and at the time of release gained a lot of popularity and was declared a hit at the box office. I have not seen it so I can not be in a position to make comparisons between the two movies. Unfortunately not many people are aware that the original movie is inspired by a Japanese novel titled ""The devotion of suspect X'. I'm sure that information like this can be disheartening to many when they automatically assume that what they are seeing is breakthrough cinema. The problem here lies with the the lack of knowledge of the movie watcher. Not every person is going to research a movie before seeing. They will take whatever they are spoon fed.",

32,1 August 2015,binducherungath,6, Drishyam though lacks the punch of its original version will not disappoint you.,"Drishyam is the remake of hugely successful Malayalam film and Mohanlal Starrer (2013) by the same name. Drishyam in Malayalam had done huge amount of business at box office. It has already been remade in Kannada (Drishya in 2014), Telugu (Drushyam in 2014), and very recently in Tamil (Papanasam in 2015). The remakes were very well appreciated and received by the audience. So, now, it is the turn of Drishyam in Hindi. The film credits begin with the punch line: ""Visuals can be deceptive"". Indeed it turns out to be so. What we see could be absolutely deceiving. This film does not deal with the 'right / wrong'. It neither promotes the 'right' nor condemns the 'wrong'. No justification is given through the screenplay. The film depicts what one could do in a particular crisis. Especially, when it comes to one's family, he / she can turn out to be very protective and go to any extent to save his / her family. Drishyam has to be watched not with the lens of wisdom, but with the lens of it being a piece of art, which showcases the journey of a head of a family who protects his family by all means. ",

Secondly the music. The music adds spice to the movie. It takes your mind inside the movie. You feel like you are a part of the movie. Thirdly the direction. The director narrated the movie in such a way that I did not even took a pee break during the interval. The direction made the film interesting. And finally and most importantly, THE STORY. The story is awesome. The story is the soul of every film. If the story is bad, nothing can save a film. It will surely die. This film's story is brilliant. It stays strong in the first half and also in the second half. The unexpected and surprising climax stole the show. Finally only one thing to say. ""Outsanding""",
35,7 May 2021,eldreddsouza,8, Just Remake Remake and Remake.,"The original is such a masterpiece and one of The Greatest movies ever. That was a film with heart and soul. This film on the other hand is a poor poor remake of such a great film. Being a remake, it had no heart whatsoever. Shameless Bollywood people only know one thing. And that is to make money. They have no creativity any longer and just prefer taking the easy route. Mohanlal put his heart and soul into his movie. You could feel his emotions in every word that he uttered. Ajay Devgn just can't emote. The man is such a poor actor and especially for these roles. Worse is in the case of a remake you're constantly comparing tot to the original and throughout the film you are feel he's trying too hard but you just can't feel it. Pathetic stuff from Bollywood.

After all, there's an unjustified death that took place, and an entire family gets behind a plan to cover it up. To my thinking, the kid Sam was a victim of manslaughter and not attempted murder, but not knowing how the law deals with these things in India, I'd have to assume that the penalty would have been almost as severe as actual homicide. When Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) decides that he'll pull out all the stops to protect his family, the intrigue and suspense mounts in this rather offbeat thriller.",

43,2 August 2015,Hazel_T,5, Moral science busted ! Apparently comes with an entertainment value,"This movie kind of challenges moral science imbibed in a family. Its neurotic to agree that family values supersede moral science. How extreme can you go or compromise to savior yourself or for the movies sake in disguise of your family. After watching movie like Bajrangi Bhaijan which brings in advocacy or drives a message on humanity, this is exactly opposite. I would watch it only in true sense of an entertainer movie. None of the situations in the movie should occur realistically. This movie is not to advocate message. No sequential evidence from the movie in the movie call for killing or hiding facts. Both the mother and daughter are pleading and begging an 18 year old, and in the bargain end up killing ? C'mon, there are much better ways of dealing such events ! :)",

46,10 July 2017,diaju_vampprincess,10, Beyond excellent!,"Yes, this is the real psychological thriller. No, this is not a slasher type or a haunted horror movie, but definitely will thrill out to the spine. . The story is simple, looks modest, not visually fancy, but it's a mind-blowing! Every part is at its portion. Not too much, yet not less. But brilliant acting with an outstanding directing of all. Each character has a strong solid performance. Every scene is very well-delivered. Even though the first quarter is to build and introduce the character, but it's done perfectly smooth. I didn't even realize it. And then the story goes. . As when the problem occurs, the audience can feel the pressure, the tense, the stress. It is so realistic so you can see how it feels so relatable. And i can feel my heart throbbing at some scenes, wishing for nothing bad happens. Just when i think what the story will be, it's twisted. The more i'm guessing, the more i'm wrong. . People say it is one of the best Bollywood movie, and i can't agree more. Definitely the best, indeed. A lifetime masterpiece. This movie deserves a wide acknowledgment to all over the globe.

The only way they can do that is to be together come what may. Just like in the trailer, it shows that a person can go to any extent for his/her family. Shot in the backdrop of Goa, it shows a Marathi family putting every bit of their energy (physical and mental) in escaping from the claws of our legal system for a supposed crime. But when it comes to family, there is nothing right or wrong. ",

But that did not happen. this movie is really fantastic By stretch of the imagination. must see if you are a Bollywood fan.this movie deserve 8.0 rating that i gave. this is the best movie of 2015 in my opinion. if you liked ''BASIC INSTINST'' ''PRISONER'' This is also a must see movie for you. must watch this movie you will not be disappointed.",

How far can you go to protect your family...,"Visuals can be deceptive, don't always believe what you see because you can be easily manipulated, is what a film like Drishyam preaches. For me the one negative i took into watching this remake is that I saw the original Malayalam version with subs about a year and half back ago(this of course not knowing it will be made in Hindi). So when compared to original even though its a scene by scene copy, it just doesn't have all the sheen of the original, but nevertheless with such a strong story like Drishyam you cant go really wrong. Because for the people who haven't seen the original this film could be a genre changing film, a suspense thriller that has not been seen on the Hindi screen celluloid. Its simply breathtaking.",

Every shot, every action, every dialogue line and everything is completely the same as in original. The only reason why this remake exists is because it is in different language. So instead of dubbing or subtitling the original they just remade it in their own language instead... It is a disgrace to the original work and is completely soulless movie. If you remake a film you have to change it, so it has individuality over the original, so you know that it is a remake and they tried something different this time, but here they didn't even try in the slightest. While on it's own it's a great film, it's just a replica and has no value whatsoever.
It's completely same as if the original was Mona Lisa real painting and this film is just a poster of the painting...",

About direction, NIhsikant Kamat delivered his best for what any thriller movie needs. Suspense is open as well as suspense is a maintained as a suspense till last second. That is the achievement of director. Best scene of art direction is when police come for first time to Vijay and his daughter was about to face them. last moment Vijay (protecting father, this is shown excellently that is what expected from every father for his daughter) comes in between of policeman and Anju.

The children do not show any natural affection towards her but i feel they did it for their own protection.The star performer is only Tabu who has done such roles previously and matches Asha Sharath who did same character in Malayalam.The story goes in same direction but has no good locations at all.

He swiftly slides into the role of a commoner and keeps on mind boggling you with his performance. Tabu is a legendary actress.. She is the only one who could play Meera with such finesse. This is my first Shriya Saran movie so can't say much about her. I am sure she is a very popular actress and she was good playing the role of a docile and gullible mother and wife. The kids were good too.. I personally feel that they could have taken Prakash Raj for the role of Gaitonde.. I missed that guy throughout the movie. Rajat Kapoor looked wasted as he didn't have much lines but he has that upper class appeal and looked good with Tabu as her husband.They could have avoided the first song in the movie and just keeping the Rekha Bhardwaj song (which made sense).Otherwise,The story is 10/10. I am giving it 9 because i felt the first song was unnecessary and I missed Prakash Raj as Gaitonde... !!!",

66,31 July 2015,dineshprakash,6, Good crescendo of thrill,"Director Mr. Nishikant Kamal completely justifies the script. His work is undoubtly fine. Original writer Jeetu Joseph and adaptation writer Upendra Sidhaye work caters fresh and engaging script. Story offers something new. Screenplay keeps the thrill intact and succeeds to keep an outgoing graph. Dialogues give realistic feel. Film's starting humor is light and fresh. The excuse made for going late night at home by protagonist is cute and his habit of watching movie establishes his character well and that has been used in script in good way. The basic point of drama is silly. When, protagonist saw that an Inspector is standing in front of a house, where both can be seen to each other, then rather waiting for some time, why did he prefer to take the car away just then, which leads the complete drama. After some time drama in first half is slow but second half is very intense and drama keeps you on edge. Somehow, I sensed most of the twist, even the pre climax twist, a few minutes before but that does not mean that it was bad. Most of the twists are logical and show off perfect mind game. I missed that why they even did't try to incorporate CCTV in this script, which is very common now a days. Nor Police tried to take advantage of that neither male lead cared about that factor. They have just ignored this fact as if it doesn't exist. Performance wise Ajay Devgan is superb. His expressions builds up and hold the tension well. Tabu is fine. Expression in her last scene is so pure and authentic. Surprise factor of this film is actor #KamleshSawant, who played the role of Inspector Gaitonde. He is just amazing that still I am in dilemma that is he real cop? Without his perfect expressions film could not have been so engrossing. Shriya Saran as Nandini (Ajay Devgan wife) is fine. Ishita Dutta as elder daughter is OK. Her change over of expression in her school scene is very good. Actor, who played younger daughter, she is cute and fine too.",

They lived their normal lives until they were forced to do the impossible. Dhrisham's story go by the same logic. If I dare compare Dhrisham to Shawshank Redemption (which incidentally is my all-time favorite movie) not much need to be told about the quality of the script, the direction and the performances. Dhrishyam is Bollywoods entry to world class family thrillers. For the entire second half of the movie Bollywood Cinema was elevated to the class of Hollywood. We had several art films or those parallel movies to brag about, but until Dhrishyam not many thriller or family drama type movies of Bollywood could have been called world class.

It is quite feasible that in a terrible attempt to preserve one's dignity in a brutally judgemental and hypocritical society, an innocent victim can commit a crime, and their family can do their utmost to preserve and protect themselves. Vijay played brilliantly by the always capable Ajay Devgan, is the quintessential underdog, constantly underestimated by those who have absolute power in society, including the long oppressive, abusive arm of the law. The core thesis of the film is a gray area - the merits of self-defence and the controversial attempts to prevent one's family from being buried alive. This movie is at heart a battle between 4th grade graduate Ajay and ultra-powerful Inspector General Meera - what a brilliant game.

Fortunately, the second part shows much more than expected. Ending of a movie of such kind is very important and that was only scaring me at the end. But it was done very diligently and suited well.

DRISHY AM REVIEW- Hell yeah, just watched the Masterpiece, gem of thriller. Wow is the only word is in mout h now for this movie. Heard a remake of national award Malayalam movie is coming in bollywood and i was just waiting like anything for this movie. Trailer didn't offered much but it was promising. Then critics reviews came which took my expectations to sky level. And finally after watching it i must say movie worths it. A rare thriller which was made to look realistic only not as filmy masala content. First half takes time to set platform, sets movie plot then 2nd half blows you away with its masterclass planning and scenes. A simple plot, a common man who is 4th std failed not much educated tries to hide his family's crime from so called educated police officers. But the content and screenplay is so realistic that it makes this simple story a masterpiece. Even a Lo ng runtime of 2 hrs 40 mins looks too tight and glues us to Our seat. W riter has done an extraordinary job, people will not forget this story in lifetime. Kudos to him and screenplay maker. Music wasn't much needed for movie,still 1 song after interval is situational which plays important role to make scene much tight. Entire star cast acted like real incident and really made me feel that its all happening in real in front of me. Ajay devgn the man who is the soul of this movie. His acting is just out of the world. Those intense eyes, innocent expressions, scary scenes and some emotional scenes as if this movie made for his acting only. Surely best performance of the year till date and i don't think someone will give better performance than him in this year at least, he deserves an award for this movie. Tabbu role is exactly half to Ajay according to runtime of movie. She did whatever expected from her role. Other star cast did fab job, each and every actor gave his best for their roles. Director Nishikant Kamat proves his skills and talent metal again here. He never left movie's grip till the end. Even the last ending scene of the movie was watchable and gives goose bumps. Hats off to him. He already had remake in hand which made direction much easier so there was no chance to make movie a crap. Overall a must watch for all. Only kids wont understand it, but ot her audience like classes, masses, youngsters and even seniors will love it. Go for this one, take 3 hrs from your life and enjoy the rare and the best thriller ever made in bollywood. Don't miss, you cant afford to miss this masterpiece. Here we have got the best movie of 2015. Last line, 'Its like,'Shawshank Redemption in bollywood. 😍",
109,16 August 2015,mukherjeesubham93,8, Terrific!!!,"I personally didn't have high expectations from this film, though there were plenty of reasons to have the other way around, presence of terrific actors like Ajay Devgn and Tabu, Nishikant Kamath had successfully adapted a south film into a bollywood hit ( the 2011 John Abraham starrer 'Force' was adapted from 'Khakka Khakka')and to top it all, all the adaptations of the original film was successful. I'll be frank, the trailer the promos were not arresting. The film started pretty sluggishly, in fact nothing much happens in the first 30 minutes, but maybe it is used for character development, it effieciently sucks us into it's world and makes us feel for the characters, so much so when the film takes off after half an hour it never lets you go. Drishyam is a very rare thriller which keeps you hooked till the last scene of the film despite its length. Ajay Devgn Tabu are perfect, Shriya saran was refreshing too, she should do more films in bollywood. Overall i think, it is a very rare film from bollywood, which should be watched and remembered.",

There are good remakes and bad remakes. This film creates a newer branch for itself, great remakes! I can't express how much this film changed my perspective in viewing the thriller genre.",
111,3 August 2015,npdeo18,7, A faithful remake of Drishyam,Drishyam remake of the same name in Malayalam is faithful to its original version. People who have watched the Malayalam version may get disappointed but the viewers who have not watched the original version will definitely enjoy it. The Malayalam version is definitely superior compared to the Hindi Version. But the actor who portrayed the role of Inspector Gaitonde was superior in terms of acting as compared to the original version. It is good to see Ajay Devgn act in such a good role after long time. This is best movie and performance since Singham and the viewers will definitely such roles from him in future as well. Tabu was effective in the role of IG. Shriya complimented Ajay well in the role of a faithful wife. Ishita Dutta portrayed the role of Ajay Devgn daughter's faithfully.,
112,31 July 2015,dineash,10, Powerful family drama with power packed performances!!,"Ajay Devgn once again proves that why is he the most intense actor of Bollywood. Drishyam is a well made remake of the original version. The makers just got it right. Early morning I went through certain reviews (the one mentioned by Rediff calling it as an ordinary film), by no means it is an ordinary film. It is an exceptional work brilliantly performed by Ajay Devgn and Tabu. Critics can rate it negatively but this film will certainly entertain you. The film starts on a slow note but picks up pace rapidly. The thrill will keep you on the edge of seat. Those who have seen the original version of Sir Mohanlal will also enjoy watching this remake. Ajay Devgn as a family man is tough and hard. Tabu has done full justice to her role. This movie is going to be your perfect watch for this weekend.",

Ajay Devgn holds same sort of intensity in his eyes and of course the character as he was in HDDCS. He lets his eyes speaks more! Tabu was one tough cop and concerned mother. She has no comparison! She falls into A-class league where comparing her to any self- proclaimed actresses would be an insult to the entire class she belongs to! Rest of the characters did really great job, specially the little kiddo in the movie. The twists and turns of events are remarkable. I am glad I watched this movie.

Family is more than anything.

How struggling the father to take care the family, but then the stranger broke it all.
This movie shows us a family chemistry as it best.
Every actor and actress do their role dramatically.
Minor is at its cinematography technic, sometimes we see people blocking, raw edit at transitions, and out of focus to object.

The strongest element from this movie is at its story, it's smart telling, mindblowing, and touching. It can elevate this movie's soul, it can make us all ignoring minor flaw.

124,10 October 2015,altaf42049,7, Thats what you call a Godfather!!!!,"One particular area where bollywood films had lagged, is the lack of serious and purposeful movies. But Drisham has put an end to this and has compensated the gap sufficiently. Nishikant Kamat (Director) deserves applauds for his direction abilities, story formulation and characterization. The movie is a combo of mystery, thrill, suspense and intelligence. The plot revolves around Vijay (Ajay Devgan) and his small happy family who runs a cable TV business and enjoys a good reputation in his area. Anju (Ishita Dutt) is Vijay's daughter who goes on a school trip where she is harassed by a boy (Tabu's son). The boy manages to record a mobile clip of Anju while she is bathing and blackmails her to fulfill his sexual desires. When he reaches at the spot, he finds Anju's mother Nandini (Shriya Saran) at the RV alongside her. Nandini pledges and begs him to leave them in peace for the sake of God but in vain rather he insists Nandini instead to fulfill his sexual desire. In the meanwhile, Anju picks up a rod and hit him on the head which results in boy's death at the spot. Frightened, upset and shocked from the sudden tragic incident, Anju and Nandini bury him in the courtyard lawn. Next day, Vijay returns home and finds about the incident. Now Vijay decides to save his family from police and the court while repairing the psychological damage in the meanwhile. Vijay is a movie-holic who spends most of the time watching Hollywood and Bollywood films. Keeping his movies experience, situations and plots in mind, he makes a fool-proof plan to avert the danger. Here enters Mera Deshmuk (Tabu) in the plot who turns out to be the Commissioner of Police as well as the mother of the murdered boy. Investigation starts but no clue comes in police hands until inspector Gaitonde (Kamlesh Sawant) informs police that he has seen Vijay driving decreased's car few days ago as he finds in it an opportunity to level personal scores with Vijay because he denies to pay him illegal money just for the sake of being a police official. This opens up a new Pandora Box of suspicions, illusions and perceptions but Vijay trains his family intelligently and skillfully that how they will react to all the possible situations utilizing his movies experience. He goes on a 3 day family trip to outskirts and maintains record of all receipts but not for the actual dates rather for 3 days preceding the actual date. When police inquires him and his family, he responds that he was not present in the area on the suspected dates and shows them the record of receipts. Police tries hard but could not find any clue which frustrates Mera and she decides to torture the family in front of themselves. Ultimately the little daughter of Vijay confesses and tells police that the dead body is buried in the courtyard lawn of her house. When police digs the place, they instead find a dead dog stinking badly and that was the master trick played by Vijay as he knew that one day police will penetrate through her family and will come to this spot. Taking advantage of the situation, Vijay informs the media nd public gathered at the spot that its the conspiracy of Mera and Gaitonde to involve his family in the alleged murder and they have even tortured his 6 year old daughter for confession. The police is beaten up by the angry mob and Vijay is liberated from the charges. But where goes the actual dead body remains a mystery till the end and Vijay does not tell anyone of the reality as it is buried under the area Police Station. The whole plot is embodied with twisty, thrilling and sensational schemes and makes you sit at the edge of your seats while watching this movie. The credit goes to the intelligent director who has kept his characters under control and made the happenings the way he wanted. Ajay Devgan has impressed with his acting abilities and showed maturity in his performance. The supporting cast also did fair justice to their assigned roles. Tabu has not been utilized to her full potential and there is hardly a one to one scene between Ajay and Tabu. Music of the film is routine alike and cinematography is even ordinary. The highlights of the movie are its story, dialogs, acting and above all the direction. Its a recommended movie for family audience and a message for children to respect and trust their parents because they can go to infinite limits to protect and safe them",

133,2 August 2015,ssbaban,10, An excellent watch,"Going for Drishyam (keeping the trailer in mind) was the best thing happened to me in a long time. Keeping aside the performances and the direction the story alone had so much of shades which made me completely hooked to the seats till the end. A simple story about family emotions told in an unconventional way was the biggest triumphant for the whole team of Drishyam. How can a father watch her daughter being jailed for a crime that was not intentional how can a mother not be furious on a family who had some link to her missing boy? All these were so equipped that sometimes you do not know who was correct and who was not (which was fantastically explained by Devgn just at the end to Shiriya). As a complete movie buff this movie for me would definitely be ranked in the highest order. It is not that whodunit suspense thriller (where one suspect who is the killer) but how someone conceals the matter in the utmost way was the biggest jolt that people coming out of the movie halls would think. Devgn playing a fourth standard fail with utmost sincerity and never once going OTT which the character demanded. This performance reminded me of his hay days when he gave a movie called ""Company"" where he oozed with confidence and his body language spoke everything. Tabu in one word was excellent, the way she ruthlessly attacked Salgaocar's family and in the same frame worriedly asking about her son spoke volumes of her aura as an actress. Other actors were equally compelling especially the little kid and after watching the movie for 163 mins I never felt bored or tired even for a minute. The movie will remain with me in the days to come for family emotions and for the compelling confrontations between its prey and the predator.",

But this one truly is totally different which was very brave of the producers and directors to make this movie in spite Bollywood totally taking a safe side with those non sense romantic flicks and they got their reward people likes it and i think this is the stepping stone towards change in Bollywood in the coming years people are less likely to watch those stupid senseless flicks again and again on repeat mode year after year. Coming to this particular movie though it will in the beginning loose all the hopes of being an 'Absolute Thriller' and 'Suspense', but what follows throughout is not less than a suspense, director has very perfectly managed to sew in suspense in those small events throughout the movie, the plot as a whole is very clear in the beginning half an hour but you'll have to watch this movie and will keep you glued not for mystery but what follows and what is the likely outcome though most will guess it it is quite obvious but how the director still keeps those mystery intact in small events is totally phenomenal. Coming to the conclusion watch for a change in Bollywood and the evolution of Bollywood which might just be around the corner.Bollywood Directors and producers should take some risks and provide new themes and set an example world wide, because if they keep on sitting on their comfort zone the movie goers might move on very soon to Hollywood and other different stories.",

The first half of the film is intentionally slow-paced and shows to the audience the lighter moments in the family of Vijay This half combines the elements of drama and low power genres. The audience gets completely absorbed in the twist of events that begin to unfold from the end of the first half. The second half is more like a thriller and is about how the family, despite the vengeful villainy of a corrupt cop, stands its ground even as the law takes its course.",

175,26 April 2017,bivabasu_274,9, Its not for entertainmemt only; not too serious too.,"The first thing when came upon our mind on hearing the word bollywood movie is - Entertainment. But the first point here - there is no song in the movie. So you cannot even in your wildest dream expect this movie to be entertaining in a traditional way. Coming at the storyline, I am not going to repeat it as it is already there several times. There are situations when you cannot judge/or call a person to be criminal just because of what he did. Instead, even he is a criminal in the eye of the law, you would support him after knowing the full story. Just a philosophic thought here; are all the so called 'criminal' are really criminal - or you would support him and will not judge him as guilty if you know why he had made that action. The movie is unpredictable - at least to the general viewers. I have never met anyone who had climax that he had anticipated the climax before it happened. Being a general man, we usually keep distance from the unwanted problems. But what you would do if problems comes itself to your door? Would you surrender to it or fight against it. But there is another way. Heard a proverb where it said that aim to the storm in such a way that it works in favor of you. Evey character are so appropriate, that you can call them ideal as per the Indian tradition and society. Loving husband, caring elder brother, Protector of the family – you will find all of them in Vijay. In the end , you will leave the movie hall – but the movie will not let you leave alone. You will be surrounded by the movie even after couple of days.",

This is one of the best ever movie that I have watched in my life. The story is also very unique and beautifully directed by Jeethu Joseph. The acting done by Ajay Devgan and by his family (in the movie) was really outstanding. I advice to all that Drishyam must be watched and it is worthwhile watching it.

206,16 August 2015,raoganesh,8, Grand Deception,"I haven't watched the Malayalam original but this one is fairly well made and manages to keep the suspense for the better part of its long run. After a slow first 40 min, the movie picks pace rapidly and takes us through the cat-and-mouse game played between the protagonist Vijay Salgaonkar, a film-addict of a cable operator and the IG of Goa Police, as part of the investigation into the disappearance of the latter's only son. Light on the songs and with mood-appropriate score the movie hits the right notes with the audience. The cast was largely credible in their roles except for Shriya Saran whose efforts to play a normal middle-class mom and as Vijay's wife bordered on the constipated .Perhaps the script called on her to assay the psychological counterpoint to Vijay's resolve and cunning; a stronger and more intelligent wife and the plot would have come unstuck. Kamlesh Sawant as Gaitonde takes the cake for his portrayal of the corrupt but smart inspector. Lovely, breathtaking shots of Goa's rain-fed mountains , rivers and coastlines adds to the allure of this movie, making you aware of just a hint of eeriness behind all that tranquility; as if tranquility itself is a mirage- everything it is not as it seems. Incidentally Vijay's cable company is also named Mirage, a fact that almost escapes us , caught as we are with other illusions. Notwithstanding the movie's brilliance, there do seem to be a couple holes that are difficult square. Firstly, Vijay's prescience and wiliness is also helped by dollops of luck which go unacknowledged leading us to mistakenly attribute some sort of 'master-architect' quality to him. Secondly, IG Meera's deconstruction of Vijay's alibi is too rushed and therefore does not appear follow a logical chain that should be characteristic of police investigations. Thirdly ( a spoiler here), the unearthing of the remains of a calf buried in the compost pit left me wondering where did he find the poor animal and how is it that he managed to transfer the bodies ( admittedly not as easy a task as managing paper evidence). This is conveniently left to the viewer's imagination, to somehow force-fit aberrant data into the larger narrative. Vijay himself , at the end is tight lipped about this , choosing to let sleeping dogs ( bodies?) lie rather than explain technical details of the grand deception to his wife who in her portrayal of innocent naiveté and low IQ is assumed to believe that speedpost and compost are organically linked. Still, for all this, nothing takes away from the movie's taut storytelling even if thematic wisps of the Devotion of Suspect X come unbidden as one reminisces about this one.",

The movie is quite different having no Hindi Masala and very few songs yet it holds a firm grip on the interest of the audience. From very start, It makes you believe that you know the climax but topples you down from your own beliefs at the end.

Undoubtedly I call this movie ""My favourite Bollywood movie"". Followed by Don2. I'm a huge fan of dark movies, and this movie goes far beyond my expectations. I thought it would be just another Bollywood disappointment in the name of dark movies, but the moment it reached to its climax I was completely amazed.

Ajay Devgn at its best what I say after Omkara and Nishikant Kamat getting mature after Mumbai Meri Jaan, Lai Bhaari. And Tabu needs no explanation, Rajat Kapoor made his presence felt with such less screen time as well. I just hope that I don't find any such movie from which plot is lifted without crediting original which sometimes I found with some terrific Hindi films but now they are no more terrific for me.",

Must say that Ajay devgan has done a great job in a film by playing a Aam Aadmi and not a hero kind of character. We can really identify his character with real world around us. Saran played her part well. Tabu is very impressive in her IG role and concerned mother. Kamlesh seems a real typical policeman by look and acting. Thers no scope for music.

It's a multi-layered story that's not confined to just one household. It could be anybody's story and that is what makes the film beautiful. The film holds. In the way it unravels for us the street-smartness of a near-illiterate man intent on protecting his family at any cost, and how forgiveness can, sometimes, lead to a kind of acceptance.

265,30 July 2015,abhaykhona,9, must watch and nail biting thriller,"What a movie , Drishyam visuals can be deceptive the title keeps promise to what to expect from this flick , After long time Ajay Devgn has given power house performance like past be it Gangajal ,Zakhm ,Aparajan,Legend of Bhagat Singh, Once upon time in Mumbaai and Deewangee category film and. Wait for such performance was worthwhile and Ajay Devgn is class apart and shows why he is weighed heavily and what caliber he is . So is performance of Tabu and rest of star cast .",
266,31 July 2015,parasarora-18017,9, Wonderful screenplay and brilliant performances,Wasn't planning to watch a first day last show after Ajay Devgan's Action Jackson but to my pleasant surprise a wonderful story backed by strong content here comes the plot as interesting and gripping that you won't wanna miss any part of it!! Wonderful performances by Ajay Devgan and Tabu! Shriya was lovely looking sweetest girl as always but overall a movie backed by great performances. The story about how a family oriented man can take life so seriously when his family is in trouble!! Nice and smooth ride at the beginning may be a loose grip for some but as the movie starts picking up you won't feel like waiting for what is going to happen next and would clap on some scenes too!! Well i did 😉 Would recommend all types of cinema lovers to catch the movie as its every penny worth! One song from Rahat Fateh Ali Khan wasn't too bad. Thumbs up All the very best to the cast and crew. You've done a good job 👍🏻,
267,5 August 2015,xxxz-55635,10, A Must Watch Movie,"Drishyam - Worth every drishya(seen/visual) !! Just half way through the film you knew who was killed, you knew who is the killer, you knew how and why the murder took place, you even know the escape plan. Still the story and screenplay will keep you on the edge of your seat till the end. A very interesting and intriguing story, extremely well enacted by the talented star cast. Even though the film's past three versions have been blockbusters. There were very less chances that the Hindi version will follow the same fate. But hats off to the producers, director Nishikant Kamat, actors like Ajay Devgn and Tabu for choosing CONTENT over COLLECTION.. Ajay Devgn definitely deserve national award for this movie. Don't miss guys this movie",
268,6 August 2015,harendradfrs,10," Unmissable, Strong , Thrilling","Nishikant Kamat have assured that even though the movie length is more than usual but you will not get bored watching the thriller. The start is slow but it was needed for creating the after-story which is the main plot. I would also appreciate the writer- Upendra Sidhaye for writing such a wonderful script which may have a flaw but as a normal audience, you will only find greatness in every scene of it. The tension between the protagonist and policeman is nicely depicted since beginning. The situation where a dad refuses to send his daughter to Goa but on insisting has to agree and then how the consequences of the trip destructs the family's peace is sent across a good message. The story also focuses on how children are given independence and boys aren't asked what are they doing and where are they which causes several crimes in society.",
269,6 August 2015,harendraddfrs,10, Another Shawshank Redemption,"For all the Ajay Devgn fans out there, especially those who were complaining about him performing more of gravity defying stunts in his last flicks with Rohit Shetty and not portraying realistic, grounded and intense roles, just go and watch Drishyam. Go and watch Ajay Devgn deliver one of the finest performances in his highly illustrious career. You can watch him in sheer disbelief as he gives subtle acting a new meaning in Drishyam. He has fit into the character of a common man having extraordinary intelligence with remarkable ease. Ajay Devgn has emoted a common man's struggle to prevent his adored family from falling apart mostly through his smoldering eyes. Watch out for him in the scene when he goes to his cable office and his assistant asks him about his well being finding him in a pensive mood. Ajay Devgn immediately changes his tone and expressions in a brilliant manner so that everything seems normal to his assistant. It's one of Ajay Devgn's finest performances till date. Tabu, once again proves her mettle as an actress with her extraordinary performance in this film.She is seen in two different avatars in this movie ; a top notch, intense Police Officer and a worried, emotional mother. And, to her credit Tabu has stood her ground firmly while portraying both these avatars. She has enacted the right amount of intensity, aggression and emotions that her character was supposed to portray in the film. Pertinent to say, Ajay Devgn and Tabu are the two solid pillars of this movie. Shriya Sharan has given an earnest performance as Ajay's wife. She has ably emoted the expressions of fear when the family goes through crisis and covers them up commendably when interrogated by Cops. Rajat Kapoor has given a restrained performance as Tabu's husband who is worried about his son's whereabouts but is also against the torture being inflicted upon Ajay's family. Rajat is such a natural actor and it is a treat watching him perform in Drishyam. Ishita Dutta & Mrinal shine as Ajay's daughters and have given a commendable performance. Not to forget, Kamlesh Jadhav who looks every inch the corrupt cop that he is supposed to portray on-screen.",
270,6 August 2015,harendradddfsdfrs,10, ***Visual Can Be Deceptive***,"There are intense, nail biting moments with the viewers intrigued with the suspense of how the actors are going to cover the crime that they have committed. Enter the no-nonsense, strict and very shrewd Police officer, Tabu and the emotions along with the tension starts running high. There is a tug-of-war being played in our hearts all through the movie where we aren't able to decide who to side with. Should we side with Ajay Devgn's family who have committed a crime, even if they are good people or should we side with Tabu, a strict Police officer but also the grieving mother of a boy gone missing? ",
271,6 August 2015,harendraddfddfrs,10, Classic Master-Stroke,Ajay Devgn and Tabu stand tall among all. Ajay Devgn delivers his act with flawless efforts and brilliance. His expressions and helplessness steal the hearts. He is simply a powerhouse of acting. Tabu shows that no one except her could do this role. Shriya Saran is awesome. Ishita Dutta is a class to watch. Others too do full justice to their roles.,
272,6 August 2015,harendradddfddfrs,10, Master-Mind Vijay Salgaonkar,"Zero to 100 in 2 seconds was heard for speed of cars, this movie does something similar. A very slow start which suddenly picks pace and becomes so thrilling and exciting that you wonder what brought you to the edge of your seat.",
273,7 August 2015,xxxzrrr,10, Master-Piece,"The story is about a family of four where the father, Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn), is a school dropout and runs a cable video business in a small village in Goa and is quite content in life. He lives with his wife Nandini (Shriya) and their two daughters. Their halcyon life turns topsy turvy when a random kamikaze stranger, son of the tough and ruthless IG Meera Deshmukh (Tabu), threatens to destroy it. The movie further is a battle of wits between the cop and Vijay and this forms the crux of the movie. Tabu (who had earlier played a policewoman's role in the film KOHRAAM), plays the role of a cop with oodles of grace and elegance and at the same time handles the role of a concerned mother with ease! Ajay Devgn plays the role of a 'simpleton' but a 'protective' father who can go to any extent to protect and save his family. Do watch Drishyam for Tabu and Ajay's performances, as they are the main torchbearers of the film and of course for the Content- which is the key! So what are you waiting for? Go book your tickets today and enjoy Drishyam with your loved ones",
274,7 August 2015,mdaniyal,10, Its shows many pictures of our lives,"After some foolish films like 'himmat wala,action jackson' excluding singham, this movie is a perfect compensation for all foolish film. Direction is so strong, on the first scene you will feel like ajay devgan(vijay salgaonkar) is in prison and whole movie will be a flash back but at end you will find...Don't read the story because its all about mystery.This film proves that you don't need 3 songs some romance dirty jokes or criticizing other religion, all you need a perfect story and perfect direction.The best thing in this film is that you are not sure what will happen next.Interesting fact is this movie is about 2 hours and 36 minute with only one playback song but even though it grabs the attention of watchers till last scene.To be honest I am very impressed.",

Though I believe each of us will be having differences in our thoughts about the idiosyncrasy of the protagonist.,
280,25 November 2015,avicky-67229,9, One of the best thriller Bollywood movie: A Must Watch,"One of the best movies by Ajay Devgan. He is seen in a different avatar unlike his usual comedy and action movies. Tabu makes a remarkable comeback. Ajay Devgan portrays a character of a common middle-class man, Vijay Salgaonkar, who has a small family. Their lives change as a twist of fate and their decision to take it on, results in a struggle that is both painful and engaging. Drishyam is deeply layered duel between truth and lie. The movie shows ""How far a man can go to protect his family"".",

Just a tad though! and 2)I wish Shriya Saran did a bit more justice towards her character. I mean she, alongside her husband were trying to protect the family. I just felt she had mush more to offer. Other then that, the movie is top notch! Amazing thriller. The climax couldn't get better. Ajay was amazing as the protective father. Tabu did justice to her character. She nicely portrayed the complexity of a police officer who happens to be the mother investigating the case. Loved the younger daughter's acting as well. ",

This is not like a boring, baseless, crap, without story Hindi movie. This movie is a complete package of drama, thrill and entertainment. The story is awesome. I usually get this level of excitement in Hollywood movies but this movie exceeds all expectations. The way Ajay Devgan performed his role is spectacular. Whoever reading this review must go and watch this movie. There is total thrill till the end. Tabu and Rajat Kapoor also performed good role. But all hail to AJay Devgan. The concept is very good that how 4th std fail Ajay shook the entire police system only with his intelligence. Go and watch this movie now.",

In Bollywood such movies are very rare. A plot on which movie is based is awesome. Also, the representation of plot is also fabulous. The way suspense created and then story reveals is more than awesome. As, it is a family entertainment movie, you can watch with family. You will think that how such great actors found the director. Ajay Devgan acting is mind blowing and the child who plays innocent role is so cute and will won your heart. Role of police inspector who hates Vijay Salgaokar is also nice.
