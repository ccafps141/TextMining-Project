The chicken comes to Rocket with his camera. Then flashbacks to the 60s tell the story of Rocket who becomes the photographer of his friends. Li'l Zé and his best friend Benny grow up to be the crime boss of the city. There's Carrot who is a criminal leader tolerated by Benny and there's Knockout Ned who turned away from crime.",r
2,26 October 2004,tjcclarke,10," Magnificent, gut-wrenching and utterly compelling","Do not be fooled by the coy charm of the promotional poster. The image of the girl shyly leaning over to kiss the cheek of a bare-backed boy on golden sands drenched in sunlight represents an ideal that many residents of the City of God strive for, but few achieve.

3,18 December 2004,trelloskilos-1,10, Stunning - in every sense of the word,"Cidade de Deus seems to have a lot of praise on the IMDb boards, and with good reason too. It simply is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary films ever made.",v

5,30 March 2005,panjshir_lion,10, One of the best unseen foreign films,"I have seen this movie only recently (2005) and it's easily one of the better foreign films I have seen. Actually, it's probably just about one of the best films I had ever seen.",e
6,8 January 2003,ElChivoDave,10, Cidade De Deus,"The film, directed by Fernando Meirelles, tells the story of life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, in an area known as the Cidade De Deus, the City of God.  The story is told from the narration of the young photographer, Rocket.  The different scenarios of life that make up the wider-story are presented in Pulp Fiction style chapters, complete with on-screen titles for each different story component.  The story covers all the facets of the life, charting the growth of several key members of the gangs from childhood through to young adulthood, with their transformation from young hoodlums to local drugs barons.  The final parts of the story focus on the battle within the Cidade De Deus between two different groups, when business and personal matters lead to an unavoidable confrontation.  And what a confrontation it is, although details will not be given away here.  The result is a powerful telling of life based around real-life events.",w
7,2 April 2007,kosmasp,9, Down and dirty,"This movie does not take any prisoners. Although I have not been into any ""favella"" (= ghetto) and I don't really know if the movie depicts it realistically, I do know that it is a gripping story. About kids growing up in a violent environment. Not that this movie is an action movie. It's a drama, with action scenes in it.",/

Then, a teenager called Buscapé (Alexandre Rodrigues) tells the story of the Cidade de Deus and the main characters of the movie (Zé Pequeno, Bené, Cenoura etc.), since they were kids. ",r
9,28 September 2018,janicenichols-32565,9, Raw and cult film,I agree with the other positive reviews here. I just saw this again after 15 years - still far exceeds anything made today when it comes to struggles of troubled youth in urban slums plagued by drugs and violence. So raw. So shocking to the system. Highly recommended!,w
10,17 February 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, Sprawling crime masterwork from Brazil,"Wow, what a great movie! I'd heard plenty about this low budget Brazilian gangster film before I got around to seeing it when it showed on television in the middle of the night, but I was fully prepared to be disappointed. Many times a film has been hyped up so much that it's a let down when I finally see it, but not so this one: CITY OF GOD is a tremendous film, a masterpiece in fact. In many ways it's like a lower budget, more realistic version of the classic gangster films made by the likes of Martin Scorcese and Guy Ritchie and in many places it equals the heights of those two directors at the top of their game.",0

12,20 June 2008,moviesleuth2,10, The Best Film Ever Made,"Before anyone says anything, hear me out. According to the IMDb Top 250 list, ""The Godfather"" reigns supreme as number one, while ""City of God,"" or more appropriately, ""Cidade de Deus,"" is at the number 17 slot. But to compare the two is like comparing an Arnold Schwartzenegger movie to ""Crash."" They are just too different. But for me, while Francis Ford Coppolla's 1972 film is rightly considered a masterpiece, ""City of God"" is more memorable and packs a bigger punch. That, and ""The Godfather"" has had 30 more years under its belt to gather its legendary status. And it's in English (which, sadly, makes a lot of difference).",7
13,23 August 2021,kevin_robbins,10, This is a masterpiece that is definitely worth your time,"City of God (2002) is a movie I originally saw at an advance screening in DC and is now in my DVD collection. It is also available on HBOMax. The storyline has a coming of age feel to it and takes place in the slums of Rio. It tells the tale of a young man trying to accomplish his goals as well as the lifestyle of other kids that grew up in his surroundings the same time as he did. This movie is directed by Fernando Meirelles (The Constant Gardner) and stars Alexandre Rodrigues (Paradise City), Leandro Firmino (Trash), Seu Jorge (Life Aquatic) and Alice Braga (I am Legend). Almost every single aspect of this movie is perfect. I loved the settings and backdrops and how they were filmed. It really did a good job of depicting the character's desperate circumstances. The portrayal of the characters and their evolution as they aged was also very well done. The narration throughout the movie helped with several transitions and established an understanding of the main character's mindset. The violence in this is very sudden and heart wrenching. They do such a good job of establishing the characters and making you feel something for what makes them tick which makes the various circumstances even more interesting. Their backstories are so well developed. The soundtrack is also very good. Overall this is a masterpiece that is definitely worth your time and an easy 10/10.",1
14,18 October 2004,ma-cortes,7, Excellent and violent film based on real events,"The movie deals about children and adolescent factions in the impoverished Favelas , Rio Janeiro , for 1960 and 1970 years . And it centers upon a teen who tries to leave that world by means of the photography . The final confrontation among the motley gangs for Favelas control is pretty violent and bloody . ",2
15,4 October 2004,FilmOtaku,9, Phenomenal,"There are many films that don't live up to the hype they are afforded, particularly modern day films. 'City of God', directed by Fernando Meirelles is not one of them. From the moment the film began until halfway through the closing credits, my eyes did not leave the television once. Based on a true story, 'City of God' spans two decades and is about rival street gangs in the town Cidade de Deus (City of God), just outside of Rio de Janeiro. The city is one where the government sends the 'unwanted' residents of Rio, so most of the inhabitants are homeless, criminal and/or dirt poor. The story is told through the eyes of Rocket, a young boy who manages to stay on the outer fringe of the gangs, befriending some of the hoods, but not participating. What he discovers he wants to do is become a photojournalist, and begins to take photographs of his neighborhood. When he is in his late teens/early twenties, he goes to work delivering newspapers, when one of his photographs of the slum gang boss is discovered and published without his permission, putting his life in danger, but beginning his professional career.",2
16,24 November 2009,Hitchcoc,9, Almost Too Much to Watch,"One must step back from an absolute sense of repugnance at the violence and look at what the filmmaker has done in this movie. Once you tune yourself into the lives of this cast of characters and their ongoing effort to stay alive and maintain dominance, you can reflect on the amazing cinematography and overall effect of the film. There is an ebb and floe that we watch, almost a dance in the slums of Rio. There is so much poverty that factions have grown up and the people are continually victimized by them as are there individual members. The police are perpetually on the take, so a military state is eventually set up. The main character is a participant early on and then an observer. His photographic skills are his ticket out and his ticket in. There is death and destruction, drugs and murder around every corner. Perhaps the scariest thing are a group of young boys called the Runts who are making a seamless transition into the horrors of the place, keeping things going for yet another generation. I think the most dominant theme of the whole thing has to do with the indifference toward death. Even those who are friends early on will kill their friends because a drug lord says so. It's an unforgettable film.",0
17,30 October 2018,chengjeffrey99,10, Easily my favourite movie of all time!,"Incredible film. Not much to say, yet I could say it all. The film is absolutely splendid in its use of colour, characters and especially music. Though some might complain of the shaky Super 16 footage, it is evidently for effect as the first half (golden age) is filmed with lots of aerials, and smooth, precise shots.",/

I was riveted all night - I completely ignored my friends! I thought it was an awesome re-enactment of a true story - powerful, moving, raw, real - and even funny in parts. I walked away afterwards, beaming. It's rare a great film like this is made, especially these days. I gave it ten out of ten. Please see it if you can.",e
21,7 February 2003,jotix100,8, The gangs of Rio,"Quentin Tarantino, eat your heart out! At least in this film they outshot you big time. Watching this film is difficult at times. The violence is to such a degree, the viewer has a problem seating through it.",f

23,23 December 2020,dashtag1234,9, A Cinematic Achievement,"Fernando Mierelles is a genius. I'll tell you why. He directed a bunch of non-actors and made them feel real, like they were real characters. It's not like these guys are playing themselves 100% I'm sure the actor of Lil Ze is not a real psychopath. The way City of God is shot makes it feel real, like a documentary, and it is kind of beautiful. The storytelling is clever, and the use of shots is also very clever. Can't believe how this movie didn't win or get nominated for best foreign. It's violent and brutal, but still a remarkable film.",=
24,13 November 2005,planktonrules,9, a horrible movie that I strongly recommend,"When I say ""horrible"" I am referring to the vileness of the characters and terrible images in the film. Technically speaking, this is a great film--with some of the most amazing and innovative cinematography I have ever seen. The stories are interwoven very well and the film seems so very real. It is so unfortunate at the film's conclusion you find out that although these are actors, the story itself is true. It's just so hard to imagine living in this hell on Earth in Rio. After seeing this film, there's no way I am ever visiting Brazil!! I'm sure many viewers feel the same way due to the absolute brutality of their slums where the police do little to interfere with gangs who run it.",t
25,29 April 2005,evanston_dad,10, Visceral and Fabulous,"""City of God"" is an adrenaline jolt of a film that for once manages to find a balance between stylistics and substance. The director, Fernando Meirelles, stuffs his movie to the brim with machine-gun editing, swirling cinematography and pounding music, but while this reliance on fancy tricks has ruined other films, Meirelles is so expert at blending them seamlessly into an engrossing story that the viewer quickly accepts them as inseparable from the world of the film. He delivers a deeply emotional and human story that obviously owes much to Scorsese and Tarantino---but his movie feels completely original, never like a rip off. And underneath all of the action and plotting, there is a compelling message about about the power of art (specifically the camera) and a suggestion that, just as the pen is mightier than the sword, the camera is mightier than the gun. Can't recommend it enough.",t
26,15 December 2004,jpisani-1,10, an exillerating ride through the life of gangsters,"I am a big fan of foreign film, because its great to see directors with different points of view than the average American director. City of God is the epitome of a great foreign film. It shows the classic struggle between right and wrong, in a brand new way. The raw directing style, coupled with a great soundtrack makes for a movie which many different kinds of people can enjoy. Weather your a Harvard intellectual or the local idiot, you can enjoy this. The vicious cycle of the gangster lifestyle is portrayed with haunting accuracy. It even forces the audience to sympathize with some of the nastiest thugs in the world. All in all, City of God is one the greatest movies of my time and each time i watch it i enjoy it more than the last.",_

A knife scrapes across a whetstone, a chicken is plucked, fabulously atmospheric music plays in the background and a second chicken makes a break for his life! A chase ensues, the poor chicken being pursued by a whole gang of hoods, armed to the teeth, and the frenzy stops with our hero (Rocket) being caught between heavily armed Policemen, the chicken and the hoods.

30,30 January 2003,Chris_Docker,8, Explores a world or violence and moral ambiguity rarely depicted on film,"The most moving moment in a trip I made to Brasil occurred when I visited a community school in the slums (favelas). These children were desperately trying to better themselves  the school (paid for from community and rotararian funds with no government help) was their *only* chance to get out of the cycle of hopelessness and crime. The awful dilemma was that the community and its inhabitants were protected and supported (with no strings attached) by the local drugs and gun running infrastructure. I was safer there than on the streets of Copacabana  no-one would harm a tourist as that might attract police attention (bad for business). One infraction to law and order would mean a warning  the second, death.",
31,1 June 2021,ThomasColquith,5, Somewhat Flawed Film,"I recently re-watched ""City of God"" for the first time in 15 years, and it was worse than I remembered. I had held this film in high esteem, but now, perhaps being older, I see more issues. First the positives: this film treads ground rarely done -- exploring the Brazilian favelas and the social issues endemic there. I think it is good to raise awareness about the plight of the less fortunate -- those whom by birth have less resources and opportunities afforded to them. However, there is a fine line to walk between raising awareness and just glorifying violence. I'm not saying that was the intent, but when all you see for two hours is violence, it is hard to think beyond that.",
32,5 April 2022,SPZMaxinema,8, I was pretty invested!,"The characterization and drama in this movie was done quite well. While I didn't like some of the directing techniques with the camera-work in some moments, in other moments it was directed quite well! I liked the ending a lot with Lil Z's demise and the twists that took place, plus how the cycle of a life of crime that infested the streets got passed down to yet another generation, quite a powerful movie! I would've never thought that I'd like a film quite like this!",
33,22 June 2006,Flagrant-Baronessa,10, Just... fantastic.,"City of God is set in poverty-stricken and corrupt Rio de Janeiro and bravely zooms in on its young citizens in their extremely violent day-to-day circumstances. Some of them are really only just kids. I don't mean kids like ""rowdy teens"", but actual little children with guns and blood on their hands. It is quite heartbreaking to watch, but very compelling at the same time.",

37,10 March 2005,pedrofjmk,10, Of how a chicken escaped alive,"Let's imagine for a split-second that you have not read a line about 'City of God' as you click Play in your remote. As the footage starts, the camera snaps back and forth in a frenzy, people dance the samba, a party is on the make, a poor chicken watches as her mates become chicken wings. And hence we get to the big chicken run. It's the most brilliant scene of the whole movie - in fact, the whole movie revolves around it. Around this frantic scene and the shooting that follows and that sadly shows the reality of thousands of Brazilians in Rio and elsewhere. There is no space in Paulo Lins' novel for the idle hedonism of 'Capitães da Areia', the renown Jorge Amado classic that tells us the story of a junior delinquent gang in the streets of Salvador in Bahia. 'City of God' simply has no space. Not even space for the viewer. From the first scene onwards, you are permanently reminded that you aren't but a viewer, that you are outside, that you have absolutely not the slightest-faintest-slimmest idea of what it feels like to be inside. The narrative structure is a strike of genius in that sense. Not that it was a cutting-edge idea - it has been done time and time again. But the manipulation of at least three hand-held cameras, the constant sound of samba and the relapses of the story, together with the sheer vivacity of the original dialogues (mind you, I do mean the original, extremely nuanced Rio favela-slang Portuguese dialogues!!) make the movie possible to be watched without post-traumatic-stress. You are outside, and you know it. Your whole body is either stiff or numb, uncomfortable in any case. That strange butterfly-cold-revolving sensation in your stomach reminds you that you are not comfortable. The way you breathe (or don't)reminds you that you're not comfortable. The way you bite your knuckles or shake your head in disbelief, perhaps the dampness of your eyes when that young child cries in fear of being shot dead reminds you that you are not comfortable, that this is not your world. Sometimes, in your deep discomfort, your thoughts will go ashtray, only to be rescued back by the next still, the next title, the nest flashback that requires your attention. That is the stylistic exercise that achieves the objective of keeping you focused and in your seat. That is the role Meirelles responsibly takes as film director.",

48,22 December 2005,gelman@attglobal.net,9, Brilliant but tough to watch,"There are exactly two characters in this movie -- Rocket and Knockout Ned -- who are in any way sympathetic. Everyone else is a villain or victim, usually both. The film does not contain a single frame that relieves the brutality, violence, poverty and degradation which are its themes. See it but understand what you'll be seeing: drug trafficking and casual murder (mostly done for ""business"" reasons but also for the sheer pleasure of killing) by young people and even by children in a terrible, terror-ridden Rio de Janeiro slum. In its way it is harder to watch even than Hotel Rwanda because of its apparent ""artlessness."" You have more of a feeling in City of God that you are actually there, witnessing unbelievably awful events without the small distance that Hotel Rwanda afforded because it was scripted and acted and ""directed,"" because it was art. This movie, on the other hand, feels like you are watching it happen in front of your eyes without a scriptwriter's story telling or a director's mediation. Those illusions are helped along by the fact that there's not a single actor that I recognized from any other movie. The actors ARE the drug dealers, the killers and the victims -- not, as in ""Traffic,"" well-known actors ""playing"" at being drug dealers, killers and victims. ""Traffic"" was very well done. This movie is harrowing.",

51,10 June 2004,=G=,5, Disappointing,"""City of God"" is an old story. So old, in fact, it begins in the 60's as it tells of gangsters in a Rio de Janeiro slum who do what gangsters do and have done everywhere for all the same reasons. Poverty breeds ignorance which breeds hopelessness which breeds desperation which breeds crime...etc. This film shows us nothing new, save the location and its paper thin characters, as it takes the audience into a slew of favela-dwelling punks with guns (so many it's hard to keep track of who's who and who killed who for what reason) as it attempts to impart a sense of warring in the Rio ghetto. You'll see such a convoluted mess of gang bangers there's no time for the film to provide character depth or a sense of the gangster ethos or the mechanics of the drug trade or a reason to care who lives or dies, etc. Just a whole lot of killing with numbing excess and only a hint of a human story. For reasons I am unable to deduce, ""City of God"" received raves from all corners and countless awards and noms. Go freakin' figure! Personally, I found the documentary piggy-backed into the DVD more interesting than the film and the one scene from the film I remember most (it was shown twice) was that of a chicken which was run over by a truck but escaped unscathed. If you like your street punk killing flicks with subtitles, go for it. (C+)",

55,29 August 2021,mcjensen-05924,2, Ultimately Pointless Drivel,"Well you're in for a 2 hour shootout here. It's not entertaining in any way. From the history of the characters growing up to how they ultimately met their decline, it was just redundant and amateur film making. The dialogue must surely have been written by 10 year olds trying out their first swear words, and man oh man do they continually repeat them. It's threats then violence then threats then killing, and people falling dead when they're hit by gunfire in laughably absurd and unrealistic ways. Extremely childish. Childish writing and directing, and all the so-called adults in this mess act childish too. It ultimately just became rather humorous it was so bad, and faded into the background as I started getting distracted by other things. It's a case of a point being hammered home so many times it loses it's power and eventually all anthenticity. It could have been a gritty portrayal of that part of the world and that type of life, but ended up failing in every aspect for me. Very poor choice of soundtrack also detracted from any possible enjoyment. I've seen exemplary films from Brazil. Funny how they never reached the level of acclaim this film did. Sadly the real talent in this business never floats to the top because what's wanted is overdone nonsense like this. I gave it a star because the squalor of the city is showed realistically, but that was purely by accident.",

I have heard only good things about this movie so i was prepared for a excellent movie, and let me tell you i was not disappointed at all. The movie shows how little a human life is worth in some people eyes. The scariest part is to see the young kids, probably not more than 7-10 years old, carrying guns, thinking it is cool to kill others. The thing i remember best is when one of the young kids says: I smoke and snort. I have robbed and killed. I am a man! What kind of life do you live when you can say that sentence and believe it? Anyways, this is a very good movie and i give it the best rating i can. 10",

In this mindset, any movie coming from the US is automatically lambasted, while non-US cinema is praised without merit. City of God, or Cidade de Deus, is one such case. Its serious overvaluing can only be attributed to a cloudy-eyed sentimentalism for the real situation behind the movie without even considering whether the movie itself has value in portraying that situation. And the unfortunate case is, no. Meirelles and Luns' generic directing is completely devoid of feeling and insight, and the actors are merely going through the motions, lacking any emotional impact in the actual proceeding of the screenplay. For these failings, the film collapses into a jiltingly generic mashup of violence and crime, with nothing to tell. There is no shock value, there is no empathy, there are no thoughts evoked. Perhaps this movie has some appeal and bearing to people who are more closely connected to Brazil and the kind of events portrayed, seeing as they can draw from another experience to put some weight into the matter, for this film by itself has none. It takes a special kind of pretentiousness and self-delusion to rate this film highly on its own merits, and the kind of a critic that dares not criticize a film with a sensitive subject.

There is so much to take in that one viewing just wouldn't create a clear reflection of the film. It plays out like a typical gangster narrative, two opposing rivalries attempt to own businesses and so bullets rain down upon the streets of Rio. What differentiates this from, let's say Goodfellas, is the sheer brutality and realistic imagery that is conveyed. Murder, rape, drugs...it's all here. But the residents raised in the City of God know no different, it's their way of life. A turf war might happen to one generation, only for the next generation to look up to them and aspire the same desire for power and authority. And so the cycle repeats. It's uncontrollable. The theme of vengeance is prominent as well. How being consumed by revenge can not just lose yourself, but the innocent lives around you. Those who segregate themselves from the violence of gang culture. It's a bold statement but an important one to tell. The favelas and slums of Rio and how the government manage the overgrowing population is what contributes to this lifestyle these people are forced into. Jobs are scarce, the standard of living is low...what else can they resort to? It's a harsh reality, but a reality nonetheless. Plenty of memorable characters, especially their nicknames, that make them human. The natural performances and raw emotion that is portrayed clearly indicates to us that there is a sense of innocence to these gang members. With many of them wanting to remove themselves from the gang culture. Meirelles' direction was frantic and fast paced with a hint of grittiness. That's my only criticism, it's too rapid. Need time to let the raw emotional impact simmer and affect you. I adored the narrative though, embedding character origins within the main plot was refreshing.

Basically the story takes place in a slum of Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, and we see the lives of two boys as they grow up in two decades and choose two different paths in life. Zé Pequeno - 'Li'l Zé', formally knows as Dadinho - 'Li'l Dice' (Douglas Silva) as a child, grew up surrounded by and embracing crime and violence. His best friend Bené Criança - 'Benny' (Phellipe Haagensen) (Michel De Souza Gomes as a child) growing up on the good and more sane side of the law, and not trying to get involved with the activities of The Tender Trio or any other gang culture. The story of the two decades, and from his own perspective as well, is seen through the eyes and narrated by Buscapé - 'Rocket' (Alexandre Rodrigues) (Luis Otávio as a child), a young man who has the ambition to become a professional photographer, e.g. for a newspaper. The 1970's and 1980's see the crime rate and gang culture rule most of the slum city, but Rocket tries to stay away from it, only being drawn into the madness by his photography, which prove very lucrative. Also starring Matheus Nachtergaele as Sandro Cenoura - 'Carrot', Jonathan Haagensen as Cabeleira - 'Shaggy', Seu Jorge as Mané Galinha - 'Knockout Ned', Jefechander Suplino as Alicate - 'Clipper', Emerson Gomes as Barbantinho - 'Stringy' and Renato De Souza as Marreco - 'Goose'. The non-professional actors and the characters they play are all intriguing in their own ways, the story I did find difficult to follow in small moments, but overall it is like another GoodFellas style concept, where one of the characters anyway wanted to be a gangster since they were young, and it certainly has eye catching visuals of violence and torture, and it has a good dark tone style, it is a crime thriller to be seen. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, it won the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it was nominated for Best Film not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. It was number 3 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!",

You can either be a hood, a policeman or a worker, routinely victimized and barely able to scrap a living. The experience is hard to watch at times and at others artful and fun. This is brilliant storytelling through the combination of editing, vision and narrative. The result is how personal the story becomes through the eyes of young Rocket, our protagonist photographer, whose simple desires seem to be cruelly thwarted as if this is what all kids in the favelas experience. Following the decades' trends, we see the rise and fall of the angry and insecure gangster, Ze Pequena, possibly the scariest of gangsters ever to make the big screen.

Although a touch too violent for my taste, the film does a superb job of telling a story about survival, greed, and vengeance. Most people will probably never fully understand the world that is portrayed in the film, but the audience can not help but empathize with some of the characters. Specifically, people who try to make it out of the favelas but fail to do so, despite it being their own fault or someone else's.

Those are not employed resort to robbery and murder for financial support.

Based on a true story; shows the life of the impoverished in Brazil circa the early 1980's. No one could place a genre on this film as it covers action,crime and history. Have seen it multiple times since, a strong nine out front f ten and a film I can watch again and again! Great film!",
108,28 October 2004,CelluloidRehab,10, Amazing story further enhanced by the fact that it happened,"My first milestone at IMDb occurs (50th review) with this amazing movie. The plot of City of God revolves around Rocket (an aspiring photographer) as he grows up in the slums of Rio De Janeiro and the events that occur there. The cinematography is simply amazing, from the various ""action shots"", to the way the story is broken up into anachronous mini stories. It is also amazing how intertwined all the stories are. You get an idea of the cinematography from the opening scene where a chicken escapes from a restaurant and a whole gang of people go chasing after it. The scene is comical at first and then turns serious very quickly as the chicken ends up in front of Rocket with a gang of approximately 30 members armed with guns on one side and the police on the other side (Rocket and the chicken caught in the middle). This movie is very intense, but feels realistic. The violence does not seem over the top but indicative of a plausible situation. The movie is also wrought with social critique : from the drugs use, to the crime (murder,theft), to the poverty and the widespread corruption of the slums in Brazil (and the similarity to slums everywhere). There are similarities to other movies including Scarface (1983), Boyz in the Hood and Menace II Society. This movie seems more gritty, more real than those movies. This might be due to the fact that those movies dealt with adults and young adults (16-35 year old), while this movie deals primarily with children. The ending is a mixed bag of optimism and pessimism (good things do happen, but also history does repeat itself). This movie MUST be seen.",
109,9 July 2007,Cocacolaguy912-2,10, Just one of those films with furious and intense energy.,"City of God falls under the pile of unflinching movies, movies that aren't afraid to be brutally realistic. If you are going to tell a story about gang wars, corrupt police, and hardship, you can't make it PG-13 and turn your camera every time someone gets shot. That just feels so fake. It is fake! This film tells it like it is. It is true to the story and to life. That is one reason I think City of God is great - its upsetting and powerful because it is furiously real.",
110,14 June 2004,tccandler,8, The City of God is a very good film about a God-forsaken place!,"This film recounts the story of a young Brazilian boy named Rocket who grows up in and around the 'City of God'.   We follow his life, from a very young age though adulthood, as he narrates all the crazy adventures of his life and describes all the various characters he encounters along the way.  His life is a tough one, filled with horrific violence, incessant theft and rampant drug abuse, which seems commonplace in his world.  More than anything, this is a story of survival in a vicious community that chews people up and only spits them out if they are lucky.  This existence is a vicious circle that seem to inevitably lead to short life or a life spent in jail or absolute poverty.  The only way out seems to be to risk your life in the drug trade where things become assuredly more dangerous.  Avoiding trouble completely is a very tricky accomplishment and we watch as Rocket does his best to make it in this God-forsaken world.  But will he make it without giving in to the temptations of a criminal life?  After all, honesty doesn't pay in the 'City of God'. The film is marvelously directed and edited.  There is a kinetic feel that rivals Scorsese's work in 'Goodfellas'.  That the material is also similar is not surprising.  This film was clearly inspired by the 1990 gangster epic.  'City of God' definitely deserved its Oscar nominations. I am clearly recommending the film despite the brutality and the overwhelming sense of despair that the film conveys.  I usually don't like films that refuse to feature even a glimmer of hope, but this film avoids that pitfall in the final twenty minutes.  I won't reveal what happens, but the film offers a sliver of hope without selling out the reality and tone of the earlier scenes. Based on true events, 'City of God' is a visceral and shocking peek into a living hell that, by all accounts, still exists to this day.  Poverty will always make crime a viable option... a natural human instinct.  This film highlights that fact with brilliant direction and Oscar worthy editing.  I am not sure anyone would want to watch this film multiple times, it's just not that kind of movie.  But I strongly suggest you seek it out on DVD if you missed the limited theatrical run.",

This movie is based entirely on fact and doesn't sugar coat any of the grisly or horrific details. It's fascinating to see that this was seen and filmed through the eyes of one who wanted to go straight laced and avoid being drawn by the gang wars lair. These kids are practically all teenagers from 16 to 19 years of age. They are armed, street wise, crime savvy and drug addicts. The narrative is quite clear without ever getting abundant. Some scenes are done in the hyper fast forward motion to illustrate a typical day for these kids whether discussing drugs in the slums, having sex, or getting shot and beaten.

I found the camera work far above the norm. The direction was good, but I felt they stole a bit from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Also, the story has been done before...poor community, drug dealing, corrupt cops, etc. I think the movie could have rocked if it was 25 minutes shorter, the characters more descriptive and understanding. After viewing the movie, it's difficult for me to understand how it received such high ratings. I found this movie no where near the top 100. It has no place among the best.

125,1 February 2005,rosscinema,8, Wrenching film is both harrowing and exhilarating,There are very few films that can capture what life is really like in virtually unknown areas and even though I have never been to the slums of Rio de Janeiro audiences will undoubtedly get a sense of the horror that takes place there. Story is about the drug wars that take place in the isolated slums in Rio and the central character is a young man named Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) who acts as our narrator and tells us early on that he always wanted to be a hood. In flashbacks we see in the 1960's that the brother of Rocket who was in a well known gang ended up getting killed which convinces him to try and stay clear of the hoods.,
126,7 August 2007,annoman,10," With an array of resonating performances and flawless direction, it is sure to be one of the greatest films one will ever see.","One of the most powerful dramas of the decade is 'City of God.' Fernando Meirelles proves that he can run with the most acclaimed directors in modern cinema with this film. His disciplined style is vigorously enchanting as much as it is appealing. For his furious and violent tale, 'City of God,' he portrays, with shocking realism, the slums of Rio de Janeiro from the late 60's to the mid 80's, where crime was the way out and those not involved were the suckers. But among these criminals and suckers is a minority of those dedicated the goodness that is often overlooked in cities as torn as Rio, and Meirelles exemplifies that notion through a young photographer and the story he comes to tell.",
127,16 April 2018,muons,9, A splendid movie,"This is a movie about young people who live in the guts of Rio de Jeneiro. It starts with a scene where a gang of children chase a running chicken and suddenly flashbacks to 60s to set up the background for the main theme. After that, more than 90% of the movie are dedicated to laying the ground work for the opening scene, which is indeed the overture of the finale and a substantial amount of mental effort is needed to piece together the events which unfold at a very fast pace and involve a lot of characters. Despite its patchy storytelling style with full of flashbacks, the movie is coherent without any plot holes. Although a good deal of the actors are recruited amateurs from the favela the acting is pretty good and director's portrayal of the gang leader Ze Pequeno is uncompromising. The movie's fast tempo and action packed scenes doesn't leave any room for character development but this doesn't really stick out.

The action scenes are very gritty and real and not full of Hollywood overindulgence and the violence is framed more for poignancy than shock value. It is obviously very influenced by scorscese but has a modern twist. It seems like a blend of Scorscese's camera work and storytelling with the backdrop of urban ghetto dramas like New Jack City or Boyz N the Hood.

140,30 January 2021,judemcrobbie,9, Dark as you get,"Visually I still maintain that that and is the most disturbing movie however this is easily the most mentally disturbed movie I've seen yet.
Performance are stellar across the board, each actor perfectly reflecting their emotion and thinking behind their character's actions.
The nonchalance of the by-passers sums up the poverty-stricken streets. This is how they see children as young as 5 running around and not even bat an eyelid.
Knockout Ned's character arc keeps you emotionally invested as it presents the nurture side of the nature vs nurture argument-How he only becomes a 'hood' because of actions that happen to him. Alternatively, Li'l Z's arc is showing the side of nature-'having the knack for crime' and being a gangster from young.
The dialogue throughout the movie feels poetic, almost like riddles at times. This presents subtly how no one really knows what's going on.
My only issue with the movie is I wish the ending had been foreshadowed better. I enjoyed the way it was done however it seemed almost forced in.
It presents fear and dread as tangible objects that can be turned off or on.
The repeated lines drum home the the themes of the movie: mainly nature vs nurture but also the ethical debate of what's ok to do to get out of poverty.
There is some truly graphic images. Live deaths of anyone child or adult, and the youthful hope of children juxtaposed to the disparo of guns.
The only person to refer to the city as Rio de Janeiro and not City of God is not from there, showing the false hope and almost irony of God helping them out of their situation.
The editing and cinematography are chilling. Furthered by the panning shots, claustrophobic narrow shots and shaky handheld camera shots making you truly feel the intensity of the action.
Every shot feels perfectly constructed and needed to be there.

This is a film with a striking social commentary. It exposes all levels and aspects of poverty and social inequalities in Rio and strikes us with the sheer magnitude of a problem that is real and ongoing! We see the fatalism of the ghetto, the corruption of the police, a society that never rewards good faith, the indifference of the system to intervene (""let them kill themselves"" says the policeman), a system that supports the erosion and the self destruction of the masses. The protagonist is too human. He is the link between us and the jungle. The whole story is about a deep helplessness! Even ""bad"" Ze is really a helpless figure.

This movie tells the story of one of the few who managed to get out of the slums alive.  It is heartbreaking to watch children who are 8, 9, or 10 years old becoming criminals because it is the only way they can money for food.  When they get older, they eventually start helping out with the drug dealers.  The police only show up every once in a while and don't do much. The drug dealers pays the cops to look the other way.

157,22 December 2003,EdgarST,6, City of God,"Some people have complained of the ""Hollywood treatment"" this story (inspired by real events) received, and it can't be denied that most of its stylistic flourishes resembles senseless action films. Somehow, though, the violence depicted in the movie has no ultimate sense, no other purpose than to follow the flow of daily life in the slums of Brazil, even more when it has been decided to disconnect the events from the social and economic structures of the Brazilian society. (Compare this movie with Héctor Babenco's ""Pixote"", and you'll see the difference.) It is obvious that some persons who are not aware of those conditions may find the images too raw or blame them on the characters' psychopath behavior. But then (I hope) neither we find reasons for the behavior of Quentin Tarantino's or John Woo's characters only on individual psychological terms. In the end, it's such a harsh reality that the cynicism of the filmmakers and all their flashy and effectist resources (like the change of music and the introduction of a strobe light in a party, just before one of the less repulsive young criminals is killed) end buried below the piles of dead bodies of Brazilian children and adolescents.",

Definitely it kept me in my seat, but not only because it's extremely violent. The most important for me is atmosphere. And Cidade de Deus really has it. Pulls you in, and won't let go. I felt the choking air full of dust in the favella. The story is fast, the characters are great. Real? I don't think so.

Told through the eyes of one of the inhabitants who witnesses the growth of crime amongst the young men and boys of the area, the story is supposed to be true and unhappily it looks an honest enough assessment of any rundown poverty stricken urban neighbourhood no body cares about. the cycle of crime sounds familiar, using kids as couriers for drugs, random killings, turf wars, addiction, hopelessness, squalor and filth. told at a fast pace in a episodic story character by character, the place soundslike one step up from a concentration camp [see the work of Primo Levi about what thats like] Oddly the storyteller goes on to leave the ghetto by becoming a photojournalist, a similar story was told here on Irish TV by a young man who was in trouble from age 8 till his early 20's when he learnt to write and became a journalist so he could break the cycle of damaging behaviour he had. the truth is to get an education seriously as characters in the film are constantly telling the storyteller but he gets out by luck mainly and having a strong character. not a brilliant film, a relentlessly told story, violent and depressing, though honest 10 out of 10 for that; it should be labelled a docudrama rather than a film  but then less people would see it, but I wonder if I or anyone really know what it means? If this goes on in Brazil and Ireland why not everywhere in which case ....",

163,22 April 2006,KingM21,6, THAT great?,"Over the course of 25 years or so, we are told the (true?) story of several poor youths who grow up in the slums of Brazil, leading to a life of violence, drugs, and organized crime. The focus, though, is usually on Buscapé, a young man who chooses not to dive head first into the grime but to simply try and work his way through it. He also has a penchant for photography, which is just the ticket he needs. City of God is similar, both in style and content, to the likes of Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas. Trendy camera-work, (semi-)hip dialogue and humor, shocking, brutal violence, and a mob-like plot line are all aspects of it and actually done decently. The scene in which a boy must choose to be shot either in his hand or foot is a favorite! That all said, there was something about this movie that I did not like and I can't put my finger on itI just didn't leave the theater thinking it was THAT great. And a ranking of 16 (48 when I wrote this review back in February of 2004) on IMDb? I just don't see that. It wasn't a bad movie though.",

Violence need not to be portrayed in such an outlandish, vulgar style. The camera movement almost made me throw up. Editing is almost not-existent.

166,7 May 2007,Percivalx,10, An Adrenaline Rush,"On the front cover of the DVD, Roger Ebert proclaims City of God is: One of the Best Films You'll Ever See! I don't agree with some of his reviews but man, was he right on this one! It blew me away! It is an amazing true story of a young Brazilian man living in the slums of the City of God and who dreams of becoming a photographer. The camera not only keeps him in the slums but also serves as a way out. The story is told through his eyes and in the process we're introduced to some of the most interesting and complex heroes and villains to ever appear on screen. It is a tour-de-force production that has merit in many areas. From the vast array of amateur actors who did a splendid job realizing each character with raw energy to the ultra-kinetic editing and camera movement. This type of frantic editing actually contributed greatly to the effectiveness of the film. Despite some dark and even disturbing moments, director Fernando Meirelles brilliantly puts it all together. It's fast-paced, realistic, and superbly written. Without any doubt, City of God is one of the greatest foreign films ever made.",

180,18 September 2015,DarylKMiddlebrook,10," Hell is Raised, in the City of God","Set in Brazil in the 1970s, the film tells the story of Rocket (Alexandre Rorigues in an excellent, understated performance), a teenage boy living in an extremely violent area of Rio de Janeiro called The City of God. Like most boys his age, all Rocket wants is to get laid, smoke a little blow and chill with his friends. However, the violence around him not only complicates this it throws him smack dab in the middle of it. When he loses his low paying job, he watches with envy the carefree life of the drug lords Lil Zee and Benny (Leandro Firmino and Phellipe Haagensen respectively) who run the ghetto. They flash money and ride brand new motor scooters through the streets of the hood. When he loses his girl to the more enigmatic gangster Benny, Rocket declares in frustration, ""It was like a message from God: Honesty doesn't pay, sucker."" Seeing delinquency as the only way to prosper, Rocket decides to pursue criminal ventures of his own. Fortunately, Rocket and his equally square buddy, prove to be the most inept of criminals. They don't even have the heart to rob a lost drunk who has unwittingly gotten lost in the slums. Rocket soon resigns himself to the fact he's no criminal. He's one of the nobodies. One of the thousands whose fate is in the hands of a few crazy fools with guns. Luckily for Rocket, fate was waiting around the corner with a better hand for him to play.",

182,29 May 2006,zv300,9, One of my PERSONAL top ten movies of all time.,"This movies is absolutely AMAZING, and for the most part holds up to the hype that surrounds it. I won't get into the story as a few hundred people have already described the gist of the story, but I'll tell you what makes it so good. First the subject matter is important and timely. This movie brings attention to the rampant crime and homelessness in Brazil, especially amongst young children. All the characters are interesting but the editing and camera angles are amongst the best I have ever seen, definitely in my top 5 best edited movies. Hell, you even get the perspective of a chicken being chased by a dozen trigger-happy gangsters! At first your bombarded with scenes from different time-lines, but in the end it all comes to fruition and is explained in an ingenious manner. Everybody pretty much is a gangster in this film (even kids) leaving no one to empathize with, so you have to empathize with their SITUATION, meaning that you feel empathy for EVERYONE involved because all the characters seemed to have been abused and are dirt-poor, living in a barrio in which you have to kill and rob to survive. There is one scene in which a child is coerced into making a choice of killing one of two OTHER children about his age as an initiation. The younger of the two victims actually pees his pants and starts crying like the child he should be acting like. Mind you, this now victim had earlier been stealing and beating other victims himself, but when faced with death reverted back to a child-like state. Mind you, him AND his buddy have both been shot in the foot as punishment for all their stealing. The scene is so realistic that you almost think it's real. And the acting? Absolutely Phenomenal acting from EVERYBODY, especially the youngest children. That's saying a lot because almost everybody in the film ARE actually from the Barrio, with no formal acting experience whatsoever. In other words after filming these kids went back to the ghetto. After seeing this movie I'm positive Hollywood actors make too much money for the crap they put out and call a movie. Anyway, in no way does this film glamorize violence or the gangs as almost anyone involved in the gangster lifestyle pretty much meets a violent demise at the end. This movie in no way tries to preach or even offer a solution for the poverty and violence in Brazil, it's just a snapshot of a day in the life of the barrios and slums of Brazil, the cold hard truth of a region that basks in the sun by day only to hide from the overwhelming violence by night. This film is as important and telling to Brazil as Joint Security Area is to the Korean peninsula. A must see by any standard.",
183,20 July 2007,FilmCriticLalitRao,8, Looks like a funeral procession.,"In Paris,France after having met Katia Lund in 2006,it was difficult for me to fathom that this soft spoken charming lady has made a very violent film depicting the rise of violence in Brazilian slums.She told the audience that it is quite normal for Brazilians to live with violence as they have adjusted themselves to it.This is a very serious statement which in some way reflects the honesty on the part of Brazilian filmmakers. They are showing what is happening in their society and by doing so there are being truthful.The violence of City of God is realistic and no makeup has been done to it.The three key elements of the film: melodrama,violence and music compliment each other well.This film also has a procession like quality to it.It is as if the audience is watching some sort of procession going on and willy-nilly,they also decide to be a part of the crowd.On watching this film,I had the impression of a fun activity happening before me. May be others will experience that too.",
184,5 January 2020,aprilzh,10, The 7th Greatest Film of All Time,"City of God tells the semi-autobiographical story of one young man's experiences growing up alongside the gangs of one of Brazil's most natorious slums in the 1970's. It's stylish. It's groovy and hip. Those things in and of themselves don't make a great movie. But here they serve the story in a remarkable way. The music of the decade and the documentary-like camerawork and slick editing all enhance the experience. The way in which the lead character's everyday struggles are expertly and fluidly intertwined with the rise and fall of the neighborhood gangs is astounding as he brushes shoulders with various characters on both sides of the law. And the narration, which I don't normally enjoy in films, is some of the best I've come across. Very well done.",
185,2 December 2009,helenekim,9, A Must See Film,"I knew nothing about this film before I actually saw it. Considering it was one of the first foreign films I had ever seen I was shocked that I enjoyed it that much. The acting is brilliant, the story is delightful and very understandable. Everything has been put together and made a compelling finish. The camera work helps the film to be so gratifying especially for someone who does not understand the language the film is made in. Every angle tells a different story so you never draw your eyes away for a split second as the film captivates you that much you do not want to a miss a single shot. The director has admirably captured the idea of the poverty, crime, drugs and violence and throughout that you follow Rocket (the one ounce of hope of escapism from the favelas). Considering I had never really enjoyed a foreign film before I would say this was a great one to see and I found it very satisfying and would definitely watch it again.",
186,4 September 2005,GavAnderson,10, One of the greatest films of our time,"'City of God' is hands down, one of the best films ever made. The script is brilliant, the story brutal, and the acting first class. Its stylish, sharp, and hard hitting telling a story of what life is like in one of the world's most notorious slums. It reminds me of 'Goodfellas' in many ways, only it's a whole lot better. Fernando Meirelles has an awesome style, his directing is fast paced and stylish from beginning to end I especially love the way he skips back and forth through time in order to tell every aspect of the story. It is a very stylish film but it also has a heart, it has a story to tell, a story worth watching. 'City of God' is unlike any film I have ever seen, it is so rich is visual beauty, and is flooded with bold originality. You will struggle to find any better, it's a one of a kind movie, that doesn't cease to impress.",

191,6 February 2006,wwillems,8, Tough movie,"Very tough movie portraying the lives of kids/teenagers in one of Rio's favelas. What I liked most about the movie is the way in which it is told, through the eyes of one of the kids who manages to escape the harsh reality of the favela. I also like the flashback following the opening scene in which a group of kids tries to catch an escaped rooster. The freeze-frame shots are very nice as well. It is a very fast paced movie and sometimes it is hard to keep track of all that is happening especially because the movie covers a couple of decades. I saw this movie after visiting Rocinha in Rio the week before. I did not realize until after having seen the movie that Seu Jorge plays the role of Mane Galinha. He makes beautiful music these days and one of his quotes is really frightening ""The other actors were ... curious. They wanted to know if the favelas are really like that.

However this film actually follows a true story, and the main character, telling the story and managing to see all the different perspectives, a photographer. The movies has several story lines linking together explaining how it ended in the way it did. The movie follows a non-linear storyline going backwards and forwards in time, Rocket's life from being a child to his age in the story is explained in some detail. This movie is more than a gangsta movie, it is the story of someone's life in the slums and the lengths that people went to to get money.

It's a dangerous and crime ridden world where gangs run the streets and guns and drugs are the things which give a man power and control over everyone else. We learn the story of this city from the eyes of Rocket, a quiet young man with hopes of being a journalist one day, assuming he can survive that long in such dangerous conditions.

204,7 October 2019,lukemickelsonflight,10, Masterpiece,"City of God directed by Fernando Meirelles and co director Katia Lund has a very deceitful title for a film that takes us down a path of heartache and carnage. What amazes me most about the film is the astounding character development that takes place throughout the plot. Perhaps the best example of this is following Lil Ze and his storyline. Originating with his childhood Lil Ze quickly develops into apathetic killer at the tragic age of ten, when he guns down room of people with a wicked laugh. As he ages it becomes clear that he is an individual who cannot function in society. A great display of his inability to function as an individual is found during the scene of Benny's going away party. Lil Ze is furious with Benny's decision to leave and resents the girlfriend because this was the only person Lil Ze was ever able to connect with. While attending the party Lil Ze is seen as awkward and inept in social situations furthering his anger. With the murder of Benny Lil Ze comes full bloom into the monster that he is and continues on to commit a myriad of heinous acts. Through the use of nonlinear storytelling Meirelles does a phenomenal job of depicting each of his characters and their growth and adaption. I also think the choice to use nonprofessional actors helps cement the realism of each of these characters. Again in the case of Lil Ze, the actor actually endured an upbringing in the City of God and was able to deliver it on screen. In addition to the acting and character development the cinematography is what cements this movie as a 10/10 for me. The vibrant use of colors combined with the effortless flow of camera work illustrates what a master Cesar Charlone. This movie and its combination of acting, mise en scene, editing, sound track and the powerful message it sends warrant the perfect score, all the awards received and cement it a place in film history.",

Anyone who watches this should recognize their privilege. This movie not only makes you think, but make you change your perspective on the world and your part in it. The writer and director take this disturbing content and change it into something intriguing.

There is nothing that I can say about this movie other than it is a masterpiece of storytelling and setting...

216,9 February 2017,filipemanuelneto,7," Powerful, this movie represents harsh realities.","Normally Brazilian cinema is strong in good comedy but rather unhappy with respect to dramatic films. However, this film is quite different. Most of the action takes place in one of the largest and most dangerous areas of Rio de Janeiro, the so-called ""favela"" Cidade de Deus (favela is the name that Brazilians give to the slums, where the poorest live, in the midst of total misery). There, people live alongside with crime, knowing that it may be the last day of their lives and having few opportunities to rise in life. In fact, this is not a movie thing, this is reality. The film merely uses reality to stage a story in which two young people take different life paths: one ends up becoming a photographer and the other becomes a drug dealer. These stories are fiction but they are very similar to the lives of immense young people who live in that place. And that's the great advantage of this deeply shocking movie: we know it's all fiction but it could be true.",

By this I mean, Neither rich people nor the government want to have anything to do with ""City Of God"", thus their deliberate ignorance of poor people should be held responsible for all the misfortune that happened. In this deserted city, poverty breeds crime and crime leads to more poverty. As a consequence, it is hard for people to leave the city and even if they do, they always get dragged back.As we can see, the only way to break this wretched cycle is education.

The experience the movie offering is really hard to watch. However, it holds you and you would get more attached more to the story. In the middle of the chaos and violence in City of God the film is about how a young peaceful kid wants to achieve his dream and make something out of his hard life. Also, how young kids can transform to be criminals because of poverty in the town.
The cinematography, music, and the timeline are astonishing, especially, the vibrant colors, which gave the film some life aspects besides the violent and the killing in the movie.

223,26 February 2010,brandon_lee420,2, Realistic!,"City of god or also known as Cidade De Deus seemed to me like a boring, overlong, not worth watching kind of movie but surprisingly I actually enjoyed the film for its realism. The setting for the film is gritty and painful, in a way, if you look at it from a different perspective. IT seemed desolate yet full of life as well. It is not my favorite film nor is it my worst but somewhere in the middle because it is slow at times and gets really exciting when the story takes a new turn or when a new character is introduced. The narration made the film for what it is and it was really needed because without it it would have seemed like a waste of time but, thankfully, it didn't reach that. The film explores violence, innocence, and sexuality so some would not like it e.g. old people. Sorry! Had to say that. It is just that they are frightened so easily and are so fragile with the exception of Clint Eastwood. The film also made me realize that Rio de Janeiro was different and more psycho than it is now. Guns are now festivals being held in the street. It also made me realize what gangsters and gangster-wannabes would to in order to cause havoc and chaos along with making kids and people lose their innocence. The part where they shoot the kids on their legs and hands was gruesome and disturbing but what was even more disturbing was that a 12 year old kid had to finish one of them off. So sad and honest! The film does not hold back it's violence because if they did the film would have less of an impact on me and some other views. Fernando Meirelles was a great director and the City Of God is without a doubt his best work so far. His great sense of direction and casting made this film work for me and it didn't disappoint. But of course he wasn't perfect and I felt that some scenes were unnecessary and could have been done without plus it would have made the film shorter and sweeter. Who hates nothing more than a slow boring movie that has no point? The great acting from Alexandre Rodriguez was enough to make him the star of the show. Phellipe Haagensen was second so don't you worry about.................anything!?",

Thankfully, I finally got around to watching it because this movie is extremely impressive in many ways. Almost too impressive. There are few films that are difficult for me to watch, but there are several points during this movie where I felt like I was seeing something illegal. Nothing in the movie seems like it's fake or acted out. In the best way possible the film feels like a documentary. The cherry on top, is that at the end they tell you it's based on true events which makes all of the brutal events of the movie so much worse. I can't even imagine all of the effort that all of the staff and actors put into this movie. Touching on the acting, it's superb all around. I think the child actors are some of the best I have ever seen and their older versions are just as good. The cinematography/directing is very creative and almost like a Tarantino movie in some ways.

Director Fernando Meirelles mesmerizing look at teenage ganglords in a Brazilian slum-town nicknamed the City of God is one of the best crime films of all time. Hey! I know this might be an overstatement so please do not gang up on me. The film is narrated by the reticent teenager named Rocket who lives in the `city of god' but is not a hoodlum himself. However, he is surrounded by a life of crime & violence that commands this ghetto. The teenage ganglords control the city of god and there is minimal police intervention. Hey, why not start a Youth Crime Watch program? I had to shoot that one in there (shameless promotion). Alexandre Rodrigue as Rocket sparks up an astronomical performance. However, the most puissant performance of the film is delivered by Leandro Firmino as the menacing youth gang-leader Lil'Ze. His killing-spree ruthless demeanor makes him the most intimidating character I have seen in film this year. Among the aforementioned, other godlike attributes in the `City of God' is the amplitude that Meirelles inserts in its screenplay & narrative.  The film is based on accounts of a true story and Meirelles & Screnwriter Paulo Lins are most credible in keeping it Rio, I mean real. `City of God' is magisterial but yet disturbing. Nevertheless, it should be blessed as one of the best foreign films in history. ***** Excellent",

A little trivia: The location in which they filmed at was a neighbouring favela, as the actual favela was too dangerous to film in. Another trivia: Filmmakers actually recruited children from the favela to produce an authentic feel for the movie. Based on this fact, it is deeply disconcerting that these children are able to act out violet scenes so well, as if they already possessed the persona of their characters.

250,5 March 2007,jcphoenix,10, A Modern Masterpiece,"Picture this: You are slowly walking towards a boy no more than 10 years of age  someone you have played soccer games with and joked around with. The boy reaches down with his hand, brings a gun back up, and pumps you full of bullets. In the multiple Academy Award nominee City of God, not only does this happen, but it does not even come as a surprise. This Brazilian epic takes the iconic movies of the '90s and creates an intense blend that utilizes the fractured structure from Pulp Fiction, the hard-hitting style of Requiem for a Dream, and the ambitious storytelling of Goodfellas. The oddity here is not that director Fernando Meirelles mixes parts from these films together, but rather that in doing so, he has created a modern masterpiece that will surely be remembered as one of the defining films for the millennium decade. Taking place during the 1960s and into the 1970s, City of God is set in the Brazilian city of the same name. Located close to Rio de Janeiro, the two places could not be more different. Rio de Janeiro, virtually a tropical paradise, contrasts starkly with the seedy slums of the City of God. The structure of the film is almost like a tangled skein  following a loosely chronological order, the movie often doubles back on itself to retell a story from a different perspective and it often takes detours to tell stories of the varied and fascinating individuals in the city. The result is a sprawling tour-de-force with a massive cast of characters  some who triumph over their enemies but more who fail. The film makes use of one of its many characters as the narrator, Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), but he is not so much the protagonist as he is a center for all the stories to meet. As an aspiring photographer that is always on the sidelines, he is the perfect character to take the audience on the journey through the decades. In fact, the main character of City of God is arguably not a person but rather the city itself, portrayed as cruel, relentless, and endlessly bloodthirsty. The closest thing the film has to a main character is Li'l Zé, the brutal and power-hungry man who quickly rises through the ranks (generally by shooting down the competition) to become the czar of the drug underworld. Brilliantly portrayed with wild abandon by Leandro Firmino, Li'l Zé's unpredictable and chaotic nature is counterbalanced by his closest friend, Benny (Phellipe Haagensen), who is like the yang to Li'l Zé's ying. Less temperamental and more relaxed, Benny is considered the coolest gangster alive by residents of the city and can save the lives of many people with a word to Li'l Zé. Stylistically, the film exhausts just about every film-making trick one can think of on the spot: split-screen (used sparsely but effectively); 360-degree camera turns; slam cuts; slow-motion shots  all of these and many more are present in the film. In one instance, the absence of sound during a key scene helps to heighten the impact. In another, a flashing strobe light enhances the haunting quality and atmosphere of the empty nightclub to a startlingly memorable result. City of God is most successful however not because of its stylistic choices, or its many interesting characters, or its score (which is also impressive). All of these contribute to the making of a great film, but what elevates City of God to the level of artistry that only a handful of films such as Schindler's List and The Shawshank Redemption achieve is its uncompromising screenplay. Not only is the structure brilliantly conceived and not only are the characters extraordinary well developed, but the screenplay is also able to bring in a sense of the never-ending and continuous cycles of war without ever trying to moralize. Simply put, the film is a window into a world, not a path, and it simply views rather than changes. In this way, what the audience sees in that small window shakes them to the core without any feelings of manipulation whatsoever. In a film in which despair and brutality are so common, the irony of the title is not lost. City of God is a masterpiece in every sense of the word  a stunning and merciless film that portrays the era, the people, and the sense of hopelessness honestly and without compromise. I would not have it any other way.",

Don't let this deter you from viewing this flawless film - even if you happen to feel uncomfortable at the sight of blood - because the film has quality in abundance; the camera work vividly captures the intensity of the script, and the raw dialect of Portuguese adds an extra punch (if you speak the language). The story revolves around a young man whom dreams of becoming a photographer. His struggle to contend with everyday violence - which seems to be a recurring theme throughout the film - sets up a tense and intriguing atmosphere. We are brought to the streets so we have an idea of how the drug situation works and what it takes for gangs to protect their business. With a beautiful view of a landscape,sadly bearing the vast and derelict Favalas, we are intentionally made to explore just how poverty stricken these people are. This film defines just about every emotion possible and with fluid skill. I don't need to recommend this film as you have probably seen it advertised everywhere, but I will say don't avoid it because you would certainly be missing out.",

As a difference, there are pure good and evil character, on the contrary Hollywood, Although one of them(Lil'Ze) trys to be agreeable and easy-going person, he doesn't achieve it. However, Rocket achieve to be a criminal or a guilty like Lil'Ze. The two main character can not change themself even if they want to. In the movie, Every character behave their nature that they've had since their childhood. Another difference is that there are some scenes that Hollywood doesn't dare to make with full of reality. For instance, the scene between Lil'Ze and robber kids. This scene astonished me deeply, while I was watching I thought probably they would cut the scene short but they didn't.

It's not what I'd call an entertaining picture, and it actually takes some work to watch with it's non-linear style and the fact that it's a foreign film with characters having unfamiliar names. I actually needed paper and pen to keep track of the players using street names like Rocket, Shaggy, Li'l Ze and Carrot. But even that all takes a back seat to the sordid nature of life in a ghetto of Rio de Janeiro called Cidade de Deus, the City of God. City of Satan might be more appropriate, as the area where the story takes place is a literal hell on Earth, and life has about as much meaning as the insect you crush beneath your footstep. Most of the picture is visually jarring; watching with my family produced more than a handful of gasps as random street violence was presented as commonplace. The worst to my mind was the decision a pre-teen gang member had to make regarding which of his contemporaries he would have to kill to show loyalty to his leader. I'm just horrified that there are people in the world who actually live this way, with little to no hope of ever escaping to a less turbulent existence. For mere existence it is, with very little chance of escape, except by death which seems the the most viable way out for many of these troubled youth.",

282,15 February 2004,ferguson-6,8, What was purgatory is now Hell,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Oscar nominated director Fernando Meireilos' film is based on a true story from the slums outside of Rio. This compelling drama literally takes us inside the ultra violent drug world run by the rawest form of machismo.  From an early age, kids are drawn to the power and elite status (so-called respect) that this sick world offers. No one really escapes.  This world is just a giant circle of blood and death where the parts are continously replaced by someone more violent.  Failure comes to those who try to walk away or run away.  This world provides only one way out.  The story is told from the perspective of Rocket, a boy who manages to escape joining a gang since he is seen as pretty harmless and is the younger brother of one of the early trio of thugs.  Rocket finds his redemption through a camera and actually capitalizes on this brutal underworld to crack the door to a life as a journalistic photographer.  The real story here is the lack of hope and the total desperation from such an early age.  Many scenes are so graphic as to cause this viewer to cringe and even look away from the screen.  Such a powerful, yet sad message delivered by the some of the finest film art one could hope for.",
283,6 July 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, Incredible portrayal of the environment,"This is an amazing look into the slums here it is of Rio de Janeiro, but I can imagine it fitting a lot of other cities around the world, as well. It's a threatening, treacherous place, where innocence can only just barely survive, if at all. There are a lot of unconventional methods in this, it could perhaps even be called an experimental film, and it all pays off. The actors are unknowns, and a number of them grew up in the neighborhood this deals with. Not a single performance is lacking, and no one is miscast, and that goes for the children, too. The cinematography and editing also contain untraditional practices, and they aid in the magnificently storytelling. This is cut to evoke the frantic, gritty, and often brutal nature of the life in the slum, and it is unbelievably effective, involving and engaging. The use of music is excellent. This has strong and frequent violence and sexuality, and the language is harsh. The DVD has a well-done, 50-minute long featurette that goes into the process of making it, a nice and funny little 60-second animation, a theatrical trailer and a music video. I recommend this warmly to anyone who watches gang-movies. 10/10",

The raw live of kill or being killed of the running and being just too scared to run the next time. The music and thrill of moving and even little kids have it to kill even little ones or they maybe instead and the music thrills and someone else being killed if they have lived one more day. The film seems almost as amazing as when I first saw it in 2002 and the cinematography is as still so even more surprising that so many of those kids were not actors, it is hoped that maybe some are still alive.",

It's the combination of the vibrant cinematography and energetic editing with the gritty, almost documentary-esque style of the story that makes the piece feel so realistic and alive. The picture is a sprawling sequence of vignettes depicting the struggles that come when trying to escape the violence that surrounds the gang-heavy slums of Rio De Janeirio. Though at times it seems slightly unfocused as it hops from character to character, its central themes are strong enough to shoot straight through like a well-aimed bullet. Besides, it generally keeps a keen focus on its protagonist, whom is used as a lens through which to view the eclectic events that surround him. In the end, the affair is a lively, evocative, authentic and affecting look at an endless cycle of violence and perhaps the only way to escape it. 9/10.",

287,21 September 2017,Red-Barracuda,9, Top notch Brazilian modern classic,"Fernando Meirelles' City of God is one of the most dynamic and exhilarating crime-dramas to come out since the new millennium. It has a that peculiarly Latin American energy that can be so seductive. Set in and around the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, it looks at the nature of crime in the poor districts of the city and more specifically the way in which abject poverty feeds organised crime and the drug-trade in particular. It also shows the vicious circle, where the young ultimately rise and seize the crown from their marginally older peers, having been corrupted by their exposure to violence and cynicism since they were infants. This is a crime-drama with a clear social conscience and it is this depth which adds considerably to the overall whole. What makes the film so good is that this realistic drama, well-rounded characters and social significance is fused with an unashamedly highly stylized and very cinematic presentation, with audacious camera pans, jump-cuts and various other flashy techniques used to tell the story. These never over-power the story, however, and are used to add to the excitement at the right moments or to convey lots of information effectively.",

Its an effective and pretty bewildering film, but on subsequent viewings this looks more like a barrage of cinematic tricks and literary devices rather than a study of human nature. All those dazzling stylistics are a knockout on a first viewing, but they also allow passive and ignorant viewers to vicariously enjoy the violence, like an action movie or a cartoon.

Meirelles shows the audience the sad reality of these gangs as most members are children who partake in violent shootings and robberies which shocked me at how easily some of these crimes were committed by the children.,

Teenagers and even children are turning to crime and only the most violent and the most unscrupulous survive. And even then only until someone even crazier comes along to kill them off and replace them. This explicitly brutal film portrays such a life very realistically, at the same time criticizing the state of society and giving a glimmer of hope that it may still be possible to get out of it all. Shocking story with a strong message, superbly shot for relatively little money. The impression is even stronger when you take into account that in most roles are not professional actors, but children who grow up in such an environment and contribute firsthand to the script. The ending, while somewhat expected, further intensifies the story, and I cannot point to any specific flaws of this film.

It's disturbing, bloody and brutal, made worse by the harsh naturalistic style that raises the tensions. The storyline is true to life - anyone can die at any moment and characters weave in and out of the picture as they are shot and replaced.

Much emphasis is placed upon the involvement of children, both as victims and perpetrators of the violence, and as beneficiaries of the large drug profits. I thought the treatment was unexpectedly evenhanded. As children have been excluded, by ""modernizers"" and other ""do-gooders,"" from the legitimate economies of very poor countries, those who are unwilling or unable to bear the second-class status of dependents have been forced more and more into crime and/or soldiering to attain a status of respect. Of course total rejection of the very thought that any child might be conscious of or desire respect and self-sufficiency is itself an integral part of the disrespect to which they are subjected.

309,11 January 2019,AleksandrBelenko,7," The Movie, the Watchers and the IMDB","Let me start from afar. If you actively use the database and read users' reviews you might be a little bit confused about pretty much everything.
The worst movie presented on the site can have a lot of 10/10s and praising comments. As well as the best movie, currently ""Shawshank Redemption"" can have many 1/10s saying that it does not deserve to be the best movie, or even saying that it is actually one of the worst movies ever.
I understand that for each person each movie feels subjective and one person will like something that the other person will not.
But in such case as this people that think that movie is ok or even good would give the lowest grade to drop the number of the movie on the list of 250 bests.
I currently is on the marathon of IMDB's best movies, and ""City of God"" is in top 20, so I couldn't miss it. And before watching I couldn't resist temptation of reading some reviews. Oh man, so many people hate this movie. Yet it is here in the top list. That actually made it more interesting to me. Why is so?
And here is my opinion: the movie is not bad. If you don't pay attention from the start you might dislike the movie. Otherwise it is nice criminal story with no romantizing of bandit life. Do I think it deserves to be in top of all time? Probably not. But that is solely my opinion.

As my rating indicates, I consider this one of the finest movies of all time. It's something of a Brazilian ""Goodfellahs."" A coming of age story, a mafia story. An urban ""Lord of the Flies."" There are a myriad of virtues to single out in such an epic triumph such as this, but I'd like to simply draw attention to one of the most gripping pieces of acting I've ever seen in film -- and it's that of the young boy who faces the drawn gun of another young boy. The scene comes in the middle of the movie and it is mesmerizing and horrific. It's a representation of the intensity of the film as a whole.",

Fernando Meirelles does a terrific (and terrifying) job as he puts together this movie with great performances from the actors, great cinematography (it seemed so real), and great storytelling. I loved the style in which this film was presented with smart flashbacks and pauses (the narration was perfect). Overall great film. Life is Beautiful was my favorite foreign film, but I have to admit this film was a bit better. Meirelles makes Ciudad de Dios so real with great characters that intersect with one another at different points of the film. This movie was perfectly made. Fernando takes us into the life of the favelas and we experience it in a very realistic form (raw and violent but true). Great film and a must see.",

And the greatest merit of City of God is not to be begged in the face of a truth that is as certain as it is painful. What is shown on the big screen is something that we see every day in national newspapers and magazines, but that we make a point of ignoring, as if it belonged to a world other than ours. The difference now is that, upon entering the world of City of God, we are thrown into a whirlwind of life, death, dreams, disappointments.

327,20 September 2013,raulfaust,8, Overly violent,"In my point of view, it has got to be one of the most violent movies I've ever seen. From the moment the murderers start, we feel like watching a Tarantino's production-- in big style, may I say. ""Cidade de Deus"" is a movie that shows a violent community in 1970's Brazil, specially in the city of Rio de Janeiro, which is known by it's enormous social difference. There are plots and subplots, with a relatively fast screenplay, which is necessary to show everything they wanted to. Whilst some are used with cruelness in movies, I admit I thought this was too exaggerated, and sometimes, even implausible. For instance: why would ""Zé Pequeno"" kill and hunt everybody out there and nobody could do anything? There are lots of bad guys in this movie that could have easily killed him if they wanted to, but writers preferred to let him live until the end. Other than that, there are great performances, with an engaging plot that makes you enjoy some characters, and even understand why they're going those things. It may not be a beautiful movie, but it's the biggest Brazilian production to this day, and I'm proud of that. Congratulations.",

We see even children possessing and using guns, killing and robbing at ease. The images are extremely realistic and the cast without exception does a superb performance.

Akira Kurosawa, Jean Luc-Godard, and many others have all made films that stand the test of time as well as any American classic. For the Brazilian cinema, City of God is that film. It is a perfect blend of three separate stories that all come together in the end. Telling the tale of how the main gangs in the City of God came to be, the film superbly balances the subject material of each story, never giving one more than the other. The screenplay is terrific; it never falters or sags and continuously keeps us guessing what will happen next. The acting is very good, a surprise since virtually none of the cast had ever acted before in a film. The real treasure of the film, though, is the visual style. The directing is superb with an incredible blend of hand-held, dolly shots, and track shots among others. The cinematography as well perfectly captures the gritty street life with excellent lighting and sets. Overall, the film is a cinematic wonder. It is quite possibly one of the best films of the decade and certainly one of the best foreign films in quite a while.",

361,7 October 2019,patpiw,10, An educational and stunning film that has tons of action,"City of God is a one of a kind movie that not only is educational but a masterpiece in the form of sound, editing, and filming. The movie did a great job of starting in the present and then jumping back into the past in order for the audience to understand the story and how that specific scene came about. The use of different camera angles as well as movement played a huge role in the making of the film as well. By using a handheld camera as well as a dolly gave different feelings and almost made the audience feel like they were in the Rio favela. The use of sound as well played a role into this great movie. The music that was used in specific scenes played gave a great feeling as well. When there was action or tension, the music played was at a quicker tempo which made the audience feel that action and or tension. Lighting as well was used terrifically in the movie because as the audience gets more into the film the lighting gets darker and darker to show the bad that is going on. The directors Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund did a fantastic job finding amateur actors who were from favelas to play the roles of the characters like Rocket who actually live in the Cidade de Deus. By finding actors who have actually been in these scenarios they can pull actual emotion on how it feels and what is going on. Lastly, the fact that this movie is based on a real story is where this movie is educational. To see the problem with drugs not only with marijuana but cocaine and how it affected everyone around them really opens the eyes of the audience. This movie is a must see not only for entertainment but for education as I said before.",

Even though many actors in these films was an amateur actor but César Charlone (cinematographer) uses his camera technique to help the character to shine in this film. Right at the beginning of the movie a scene after chicken chase, Rocket (Main Character) was standing in the middle between Liz Ze Gangster and the Police. César Charlone uses handheld camera movement circular around Rocket from the low angle in a fast motion before a cut and transition to Rocket childhood story. I think this is one of the best flashback transitions I have seen. The tone of color in this film considered very vividly. At the beginning of the film, the tone that is used was light blue, surrounded by tall concrete buildings. Then after the transition, Rocket's childhood story color tone was light brown/yellow given a warm feeling. Since the flashbacks, if looked at this film closely, when the story progresses the color tone slowly transition from light to dark. The scene when Benny was being shot, when a high camera angle and a long shot was used, the tone of the setting was considered grey to black. This film was using a powerful scene right at the beginning that creating a reflecting on the people of Cidade de Deus. This movie will circle and meet the first scene at the end of the movie. In the beginning, the chicken is running away from the people because it saw its friend being killed. The chicken decides to runways as fast as possible without looking back. The chicken symbolizes the people in Cidade de Deus, there are only two choices to choose from, to join the gang and be killed or runaways as far as possible. Rocket choose to run away to pursue his photographer career but he did not run far enough, eventually, he ends up back at the city.

In the vortex of this maelstrom is L'IL Z (Leandro Firmino DA Hora--like most of the cast, a nonprofessional actor), self-appointed king of the dealers, determined to eliminate all competition at the expense of his corrupted soul. With enough visual vitality and provocative substance to spark heated debate (and box-office gold) in Brazil, co directors Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund tackle their subject head on, creating a portrait of youthful anarchy so appalling--and so authentically immediate--that City of God prompted reforms in socioeconomic policy. It's a bracing feat of stylistic audacity, borrowing from a dozen other films to form its own unique identity. You'll flinch, but you can't look away.",

The film is directed a way that contains multiple stories or chapters, to explain how their neighborhood evolved the way it did. Each of the main characters has their own chapter to show their evolution throughout the film. It contains acts of drugs, sex, violence throughout this the story, and the actors did a brilliant job recreating the storyline. This film applies different lighting, camera angles/elements and music play an important role when creating this film. The film utilizes a handheld camera to capture certain moments that allowed the audience to view events as how the charters would have. Due to the main character Rocket main desire to become a photographer, the directors utilize this plot story fact to show much of the film through his eyes. The music indicates what is building up in the film, such as upbeat and fast music playing when violence is on the horizon. Although this film contains such a strong presence of violence that leads you turn your head at moments, this element demonstrates the disgusting reality of the lively hood of people who live in slums such as this. I rate this film a 10/10 due to the accurate representation of gangs, poverty and crime. There is such a heavy presence of suspense, that it keeps viewers on the edge of their seats and constantly eager for what is to come. Overall an unforgettable film and a cinematic masterpiece.",

So I finished the movie with a big grin on my face, knowing that I just watched on the most powerful, brutal, and one of the greatest films of all-time. The camera view, acting, cinematography, and dialogue were all astonishing but I finally got to see my first one and I'm just so happy by seeing it. One of the greatest films, for sure.

There's a vibrancy, urgency, compassion, and scope that makes this movie so hard to pull away from. The story of a boy named Rocket trying to escape and being pulled back into the violent conditions around him, as well as the local history that created this environment. We see generations of slumlords few old enough to drive, come and go, in ages and empires, of drugs and fashions from the 60's to the 70's. Most of the performers here are not actors but children from the infamous slum, including Brazilian pop star Sue Jorge(seen in the Life Aquatic seeing David Bowie songs) who also grew up there. There's an immediacy, honesty, and energy to this film that 90 percent of films about gangsters, street life, and the 3rd world miss.

Karma is unforgiving for the bad but it rewards the good in any which way. It's something everybody underestimates. As a European, I find it completely incomprehensible that people live this way. I judged them the complete movie and it's really hard to watch all of those lives get wasted for actually nothing but I guess it's something me and my culture (in general) can't realize. I found a connection with Rocket. He was a guy which was aside most of the time, has some friends but no enemies. I believe many innocent people like him get killed in favelas, which is frustrating, but surely you have much more chance in succeeding than gangsters and drug dealers.

With kids being as skillful in murder as the average human being, City of God is a totally different look into the country of Brazil, one that you'd never see on the Travel Channel.

The film is spectacular, every performance feels completely authentic the characters emotions are completely palpable. It's a disturbingly blunt and stylish view at a world we don't know but can't deny. A world we hate that exists yet are totally drawn towards. This film is better than any film made in America in the past 10 years, it belongs on the top #20 where it's at here, but it truthfully deserves a higher post. It's not only a great film, but it's has a conscience that is lacking from other crime films. The protagonist, Rocket, is the guiding light in this world of darkness, who leads us from temptation to temptation, mixing us in with these impoverished people and drug-fueled gangsters on a Homeric odyssey that has one of the most poetic and cynical endings I've ever witnessed. Not to be missed, if you haven't seen City of God, you are woefully missing out.",

The story follows an underworld tale of organized crime in the City of God suburb, which involves criminals and drug dealers. I personally thought that the movie was rather excellent. The movie was provided by an excellent director named Fernando Meirelles, and he used a lot of charm to the movie. I also enjoyed the use of cinematography, film editing, transitions, and music. To show an example, the use of editing and transitions can play back a character's story, or in other words, the story goes back and forth to talk about a particular character. Also, the cinematography was used to draw the audience's attention with all the zooms, pans, and wides, putting us in the middle of everything. Finally, the acting provided by unprofessional actors was brilliant in every way, bringing tons of heart and drama into the characters. To me, I think of foreign movies are pieces of entertainment in a different country, which is still fun to watch. When I heard about the movie, I had no idea that it was actually a foreign film, but since I know now, I respected the movie for what it was. The overall look of the movie was brilliantly organized, and it made the audience feel like they are walking the streets of the City of God. How awesome is that?

What a movie. It takes you for an unrivaled trip to the youth ghetto of Rio, the so-called ""City of God"". We follow the lives of some kids, who grow up in the late 60's - most of them don't live to experience the 80's. The only, or let's say: the fastest way to get out of these dumps are violence and drugs. Using violence and pushing drugs. You better not mess that order up, or you're done. While debutant Fernando Meirelles shows the incidents in ultra-realistic (and therefore mind-numbingly brutal) fashion, he nevertheless achieves great art by splicing up the story, going from the present to the past, using newest technology wisely, speeding up the tempo with great ease, but also slowing down whenever he has to and showing the ability to be tender. He teases the audience with hints about things to come, and when he gets back to those things, he always delivers in a big way. The film has about a dozen important characters, and it's amazing how Meirelles not only manages to introduce them with style, but also keeps track of them so that we always know who we are dealing with.",

Gangsters,Drugs,Deaths,Gunshots are pretty common for the people living in the city of god. Maybe this sounds common as we see this in many movies, but what is uncommon is that a person burying his alive wife, a young boy killing all the people in a motel, small boys who can hardly speak roaming around with guns etc. Part of the story is based on revenge.

394,30 March 2003,Dockelektro,10, Blood and Mud Masterpiece,"Never in the history of cinema the favelas assumed the real place they earned as a melting pot of cinematic value. Ultimately, Fernando Meirelles understood that it was time to fill the gap, and, corageously, moved forward into the excruciating experience that would be the making of a movie about them. When you see this movie, you'll thank him in silence. Because Meirelles' movie grabs this world-within-a-world with rare boldness, and makes it much more than a simple ""south american goodfellas"" like someone called it. ""Cidade de Deus"" is a view-changing experience, for it is the first time the audience leaps deep into the schemes, the violence, the blood and the mud. And your vision of the street gang violence in Rio de Janeiro will never be the same. Magnificently acted (and don't forget these were all people from the real ghetto), brilliantly framed and graspingly edited, this movie's real triumph is letting us know what goes inside the places we never dare to get into. And succeeds in doing so with the touch of genius. With immense production values, it is amazing how the movie never gets too heavy or too epic, and you'll marvel at the way realism is the motto here, while the film never has pretentions of becoming a mockumentary. This movie's got heart, and real guts. And it ends up becoming the film about the favelas no one ever dared to do. So you'll thank director Meirelles - rarely there has been such courage from a movie maker.",

City Of God shows us what you could say is the hidden side of Brazil away from its glittery night life and laid back attitude, it is a cold, hard knock to the head which shows that the words 'Life is Cheap' live up to its expectations. The tag line of the movie is Fight and you won't survive , run and you won't escape and it could not be more closer to that as the movie shows us the life of kids/teens growing up in the slums of Rio De Janerio. Don't mistake this for a hyped up ghetto and glamorising gun-totting movie! City of God is a pure , raw side of life in the harsh slums of Rio where truly only the strong survive . The main character if you may is a guy called Rocket who just like any other teen dreams of the better things in life i.e. a good job , house , babes ! But always finds him-self down on his luck as he can never truly escape the dangers and problems that he faces growing up (as if being a teen is not tough enough!) The movie is then played out in a Pulp Fiction format showing the lives of the people around him and like him all of them have hopes and dreams but are all sucked into the harsh void of reality . The acting was top-notch all round and the direction of the movie just made you want more but to some it up in general City of God is an experiment with the truth which makes the likes of Snopp Dogg and 50 cent look like a bunch of playground bullies as it holds nothing back in showing the life faced living in Rio's slums and to what extend people will go to , to get what they want from life when circumstances don't give the basic things we take for granted in our lives.

And that's fine, and yes I have a point. People like you need this movie to be based on the truth, you're so warped in your overprotected, sterile life in a ridiculously puritan culture that this kind of intangible reality is all you have left to keep you from offing your fellow virgin colleagues at school. What else is a major factor in this unconditional love for having other people live a life of misery and violence? Ignorance (deep...). The stupider the person, the more one-dimensional their outlook is on foreign culture. They think Africa, their minds rush off to a malnourished Somali child with a hood over his head in a refugee camp... nothing else matters to them, that's Africa and that's final. Now, think Brazil... samba, Pele, Rio, poverty, violence, drugs... and all that noise. That's all this country is... nobody can walk the streets without being ransacked by a half-dozen monkey boys who will take your money, rape you and thrash you to within an inch of your life. All women are prostitutes, all people do all day is watch reruns of Pele's soccer matches and dance to Carnival music. Now, I've lived in Brazil for some 18 years, 2 of them in São Paulo, I've been to Rio, and I currently reside in one of the wealthier cities in the country (wealth in Brazil?? he must mean he owns a lot of soccer-playing prostitutes). I've never been mugged (what?? you just said you went to Rio!!). This city is overrun by BMW's, high-powered executives, and a ridiculously high standard of living, you rarely see a beggar walking the streets... by the way, I live in Brazil. Now, if you're as retarded as I imagine you are, you're there with a pathetic smirk on your acne-ridden face going ""well la-di-da for you"". I want you to mock me, because by doing so you're confessing to being a moron. Now, about the movie. I loved it... it's great micro-nonfiction that summarizes in a very stylized manner an issue going on in the ostracized portions of society, the portions that some people need to live in pain in order to feel better about themselves (yes, you..). Now, what's the problem with it? It echoes the stereotype the American society embraces as supreme regarding life outside their fortress, and the fact that the director is Brazilian furthers this stupidity. I'm not going to waste my time lecturing potential viewers, everyone has their head cemented miles up their own a*s, inertia is a major lifestyle, self-indulgence is the most pragmatic of dogmas that you people perpetrate on yourselves, your opinion is an absolute truth, no matter how much of it is based on creative coloring-in of the proverbial blanks (in most cases, a blank sheet).

Ultimately City of God is more exciting than Scarface, more colourful and ultimately more brutal and depressing. Not least because the killers in this film are very young-as often as not, just children. And it is all the more chilling because many of the kids are played by non professionals from the poorer parts of Rio. The narrator is Rocket, who is growing up in Cidade de Deus, a sink estate on the edge of Rio, a place where baiting the police is a way of life, every child is destined to be a thug and making it past 18 years old is a real bonus. The toughest kid in Rockets neighbourhood is Little Ze and, as they reach their teens, Ze embarks on a reign of terror when his killer instinct helps coke them over from grass as one of the few commodities Rio's poor can sell its rich. City Of God's chief success is in pulling off a crucial balancing act. It manages to survey a world that is wild and thrilling and full of great music and good parties, but never lets up on the fact that it's also a death trap where eight year olds tout semi-automatics and friendship counts for nothing. A lot more than a cheap holiday in someone else's misery. Anyone who ever chanced to watch MTV's cribs or Hello magazine's At Home With The Stars kind of stuff-will have noticed that all rappers, nu-metallers and pop punks feel obliged to own the DVD of Scarface blood soaked tale of guns and coke dealing and claim that its the best movie of the sort ever made. Maybe, just maybe, some of them will find shelf space for City OF God.",
416,12 May 2020,cakyolcu,1, A big disappointment,"I do not really understand all those ""10 points"" here. I only watched the first hour of the movie and to be honest the last 20 min of it was battle with myself in terms of patience. Poor narrative, trivially no-sense violence,
superficial handling of characters (children killing around), sorry but no story at all!! As I am also from a developing country I am pretty much aware of all those sad stories in ghettos, however this one could have been told in such a dramatic way which the movie did not. And it is dramatic; there is nothing ""fun"" about it.",

The story is told like a documentary with the main character playing narrator and talking about his experience in the slums known as the ""City of God."" We follow the lives of himself as well as friends and adversaries from childhood to adulthood. The movie does a good job of conveying how hopeless life can be in certain parts of the world and that sometimes there are no options for those living in such conditions (unless they get extremely lucky like the main character).

The way the story is told - meeting characters who are important to the plot, yet you don't know that until later when it is all tied together. The shots are gorgeous and I was wowed by many of the camera transitions throughout; especially the cut between Lil Ze to Steak to Carrot. As for the entertainment factor and story of City Of God it has a powerful message of corruption and the lengths people will go to, to survive in the never ending cycle of crime and poverty within the City. Some of the scenes are hard to watch as it feels like your watching a documentary instead of a film, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat and engaged for the entire run time. I would recommend this film to anyone whether you're a film nerd, filmmaker or just casual viewer.",

I may call it the Brazil version of the 'Godfather' or 'Slum Dog Millionaire' not just for its style of storytelling or the mere similarities in the plot, but for how great those movies were. What's bonus for 'City of God' out of all is that it's based on true events.

Even if you are not interested in violence, Brazil, or (gasp!) subtitles, the camera angles, lighting, and innovative use of handy cams are stunning. The movie has a real documentary feeling to it and features characters that you actually care about. There was not one death that occurred in this movie that came as a relief. I was actually emotionally attached to all of them. (Even the ones that may have deserved a violent death.)

Certainly, there's a Hell of a film-making talent here and the end result is truly, and sadly, unforgettable. I can't say I enjoyed seeing this movie but technically it does have great merit. And, having sat through this movie, now I know that the very last place in the whole world that I would like to see at first hand is this slum outside Rio. I've never had any great desire to go to Brazil or to any of its major cities despite having traveled widely.

440,15 May 2007,sacredmonk,8, Pulp Fiction Style Documentary,"First off, there are a few grievances I have with this film. It's sort of made in a way where it's kind of spread into chapters. Sort of like pulp fictions is made into chapters, depicting the story of several different people and events, so too is this film. I don't think this adds anything to the film, since you'll probably end up confused by the number of people anyway. There are a bit of characters, and trying to follow the story of each one may be bit confusing. The film is also narrated by the main character. In essence he gives you a tour of the ongoings of the City of God. In a way, it sort of feels like you are being shown a documentary about a city, rather than being given a movie to view. The documentary style, though informative, seems to be a bit over used, and removes the no-documentary movie feeling. That being said however, the film is good for the story, and depiction of the struggles of both the city and the many characters of the film. The corruption, sorrow, anger, greed, love, and joy are all expressed very clearly, and the film allows you to fully understand these feelings in the characters (once you get them all straightened out). I realize that following only the main characters story line would have drastically crippled the film, and would not have been able to illustrate every other characters story. Because of this it is essential that there are very many characters in the film. Understanding this, it is difficult to lower the movies rating based on there being too many characters to distinguish, as it is necessary for the story line. All in all, this film is above average, however an 8 out of ten may be a little bit generous. A 7.6 would be more accurate. Watch it if you have an opportunity to, but don't go out of your way to.",

And probably that is the reason , the movie starts with a chicken slaughter.But this is the truest depiction of Brazil in that period. The lawlessness prevailing due to a callous Government regime, the fearlessness of the people due to a corrupt police system, growing addiction of the young generation, lack of education everything has been portrayed in an impartial manner. The hard hitting dialogues, the impassioned ambitions, the rise and fall of the gangsters everything is so credible.You are not going to be bored for a single moment in the movie even though the run-time is over two hours.Those who have beautiful fantasies of the streets of Rio, the voluptuous samba dancers, soccer skills of the youngsters may be shocked to see the harsh realities of life. The film is based on a true story and every detail of the story has been depicted in a documentary style, making it even more enjoyable for those who want to experience the life and cultures of the land of Samba.

It doesn't play with the amount of blood: When they shoot someone, you get the idea without slowmotion close-ups! It's better this way. I like the simplicity of the Brazilian actors.

464,15 October 2018,mschultz-26078,9, Amazing Storyline,"In the Film City of God, Directors, Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund, do an excellent job conveying the story of a young boy who lives in a favela known as the City of God. They show his story growing up in poverty and the pursuit of his dream of being a photographer. With use of excellent motifs and stunning order of events this Film earns two thumbs up in my book.
 One motif that stood out to me during the screening of the film was the relation of Good and Evil. Many times, throughout the film, characters reference the idea of ""Love and peace"". In reality, this idea was stretched most times to being evil. Even many Characters who lived peacefully, found their downfall by facing evil head on. 
 Another thing I found spectacular in the Film was the order the story was shown in. The opening scene of the movie was the most important and actually serves as the climax of the film. The opening scene also conveys a series of flashbacks (or even flashbacks inside of flashbacks) in which story is described and narrated. Throughout this description, we learn about all the characters and their importance to that final scene. It was an interesting and powerful way to convey the story nonetheless.
 In short, the Film City of God is a must see for anyone who enjoys strong storyline where little is left to the imagination. In the Span of a couple hours, you will laugh, be sad, and even be heartbroken. I Recommend the film to everyone to see!",
465,4 February 2003,ColeSear,10, Captures Lightning in a bottle,"""'Cidade de Deus' captures lightning in a bottle. Like many, if not all of the internationally reknowned Brazilian films of the past decade 'Cidade de Deus shows us a segment of the Brazilian population in near perfect cinematic simulacrum. A story whose structure is indebted to ""Citizen Kane"" and is just as intellectually stimulating, this films narrative moves circularly telling the tales of many characters who become the central figures in a 'favela'. Rarely is criminality portrayed in such dimension, there is not one 'no-nonsense, tough as nails, born a jerk will die a jerk in this but. The characterization separates and explains the motivations of each main cast member perfectly. The word circular works also to describe the nature of the story which is one of crime and corruption; it is something that never ends as we all know but the filmmaking is so captivating that we expect a 'happy ends' but love the truth the film shows regardless. The Samba-infused score and  frenetic cinematography work hand in hand to add rhythm and emotion where it is needed but the cold, shocking and gut-wrenching scenes are left as is and work wonderfully. This is a film worth multiple viewings and careful examination and is a rarity a great piece of art that ALSO makes a socio-political statement.",

Usually telling a story of this scope and size is very difficult to pull off, but the director easily succeeds in keeping an audience's eyes wide open throughout the whole picture. It's most definatly shocking. Some of the scenes are hard to watch, with some of it's documentary style approach. It is also very funny, and very poignant. Being a foreign film, i knew none of the actors, but it just made it all so much better. The friendships really seem genuine, and when some of the friendships fall, you literally feel the emotion pour out of the screen. Lil ze, the more deadly character in the film is played brilliantly, and whenever he's on screen, looking towards the camera, you almost feel obliged to walk away.

At first, it is honestly difficult to care about a single character. But then it hits you, these are all children, kids. All the main characters doing the killing are kids. This draws you into the film and the thought that many (if not all) of these kids never really had a chance. Rocket is fortunate to become interested early on in the craft of photography and this interest paves the way for a better life for him. However, others who only know about survival and aren't privy to extracurricular interests like Rocket's have their fates sealed. Benny is the other character you begin to care about.

Recently, when Roger Ebert was praising this to the high heavens, I had to wonder--lately he seems to be awfully full of gushing hyperbole (_The Hunted_ was ""a pure and inspire chase film""--did he see the same crapfest I wasted my money on?). But _City of God_ is actually worthy of the acclaim. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and it does very well what you want the best films to do--take you someplace you've never been before, someplace you couldn't go even if you wanted to. Sure, it is a violent film, but no more violent than something like _Gangs of New York_, and the violence here is all to a purpose--showing what happens to gang kids who grow up without any chance, without any guidance. The film is closer to something like _Goodfellas_ anyway, in showing the rise and fall of a gangster, and showing the development of a gangster culture, from the 60s into the 70s, as the relatively innocent marijuana business gives way to the more profitable and violent cocaine trade. The film is almost Dickensian in showing how a place affects the people who live there, and while it calls for change, it never does so in a preachy way. This is just an amazing, vivid, astonishing experience and you owe it to yourself to see this film in a theater if you can, on video otherwise.",

Cidade de Deus takes us to a reality we try to hide from our minds, a place where drugs, murders, betrayals and so on are common, a place where the good and evil is distinguished only in the minds of each ones as there are nearly no rules.

488,12 October 2020,jessehoffmeyer,9, City of God,"People enjoy a coming-of-age story. Seeing someone struggle through hardship and come out stronger and more prepared in the end. But in the City of God, coming-of-age starts with you holding your first gun, and ends with you on the streets; cold and stiff. People enjoy a war story. Falling in love with characters fighting through hell to come back to the safety of home and reunite with loved ones. But in the City of God, there is no safety to return to, and no family left to protect.
City of God seamlessly blends a coming-of-age tale in the midst of violent gang warfare in the slums, called favelas, of Rio de Janeiro. At parts, the film cuts fast and deep, weaving back and forth through time and matching the energy of the coke and rage fueled action on screen. A smart decision, even if the pace early on may leave some confused. Other parts are more methodical, a calm before the storm as characters enjoy the normal life of being with friends, flirting with girls, and snorting coke. Sound helps mediate this difference with upbeat tracks that emphasize the safety of good moments, to the long and tense periods of silence. There is a notable lack of music in tense sequences which expands the suspense beyond any other instrumentals found in the same spots as other films.
What is truly special about the film are the actors, or lack thereof as many were cast from the surrounding favelas. These non-professional actors not only highlight themselves, but the city that has given them this live fast or die hard nature. Even though filming was done decades after the events that take place, favelas are still a prominent and dangerous locations in Rio. More or less making the kids shown in the film the same as those they are portraying, having been born and bred in deep seeded poverty. These kids may find themselves one day in the roles they were cast in, condemned to die for the same reasons they died on screen; because war, war never changes.",

493,13 October 2020,vanessapeinado-01555,9, Such a raw and insightful film,"The use of sound in this movie is very different from the typical movies being released at this time. I would say overall this movie is very different, I think it is more real than what I've seen lately. When I say real I mean there is not a lot of advanced effects or serious CGI going on. There was the use of the split-screen and some other minor effects but nothing too grand to make the movie seem like a made-up story. The limit of these effects makes the movie real to me, almost as if the audience is right there with them. I also think the sound helps bring the realness to life because the background noises of washing dishes or the gravel on the ground are loud enough to be noticed. They are at the volume they would be as if you were right there, or pretty close to it. I think that the ambient sounds are the most used sound effect and it helps give a perspective of the location and even time period. I would say that the diegetic music also helps illuminate the time period with the party music they listen to and the overlapping of the voices adds to this raw, realness vibe I keep mentioning. The narration helps the timeline flow and easier to follow. It takes us along and gives us what we need to know to put the pieces together and understand the characters. Overall, I like this film because it gives an insight into what it was like to live in the slums and the film was portrayed very well.",

The movie is very unique, taking the whole gangster concept to a different level, using young men who basically feel they have no choice but to become hoodlums and deal drugs. Rocket, the main character, is very likable and funny at times. I felt for the characters and thought the actors were very, very good. As I said, it seems so real, because if I'm not mistaken, it's based on a true story. It's kind of disturbing sometimes to see young kids dealing drugs, smoking, and shooting other people(or getting shot at), but it makes it very intense. I thought the subtitles were going to get really annoying, but I got used to them fast and they only bothered me a few times when they were talking pretty fast.

Nonetheless, it left me with nothing else to do but research the real life of the self-made photographer, ""Rocket.""

Unfortunately, so does reality.","I read many comments complaining that this movie doesn't do much to make you care about the characters and therefore doesn't connect you emotionally with the plot. I just want to point out that this lack of sensibility doesn't represent a flaw from the director or the script. Do you really think that people who grow up trying to be constantly high on drugs to escape reality, struggling to survive and numbed down by the omnipresent violence manage to become very sensitive or deeply caring? Unfortunately not. As a Brazilian who had his share of experience with violence, it's clear to me that the state of mind in which these ""gangsters"" live don't leave much space for meaningful emotional development. I am sure the director wanted to show us how does it feel to be there and how small is the presence of sanity and hope (portrayed mostly by Rocket) amidst the chaos; and the fundamental importance to nurture them.",

534,23 April 2023,nickjones-96546,3, Exploitative and nihilistic,"City of God is a movie that bombards the viewers with its relentless and gruesome portrayal of the violence and chaos in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, yet fails to deliver a compelling or meaningful story. The film is a mess of disjointed scenes that jump back and forth in time between different characters, making it impossible to care about anyone. There is no single clear plot or a central protagonist, instead throwing a bunch of episodes that show how the favela degenerates into a bloody battleground ruled by drug gangs at the viewer. The film ignores the root causes and social context of the violence and poverty in the favela, indulging instead in the sensational and graphic aspects of the gang wars. There seems to be no hope or redemption for the characters or the community, rather a cycle of violence and crime that seems a permanent feature of the slum. The movie seems to take joy in depicting violence - including multiple graphic murders of children - as if it was a PG-13 Hollywood crime caper, despite the otherwise serious, tragic, and grotesque subject matter. I'm sure this was intended as a ""message"" movie, but the filmmakers seemed to be exploiting and glorifying the violence without condemning it, especially given the slick and stylish editing. City of God is a film that is more obsessed with style than substance, more eager to shock than enlighten, and more nihilistic than realistic.",

Fernando Meirelles' use of lightening and shadows and filmed snapshots is incredible and augments the symbolism of the camera in Buscapé's life journey. I enjoyed how the film progressed in a novel-like fashion, imitating the book that it portrayed with various ""chapters,"" each of which described a particular character's story. Likewise, the development of a large number of characters is sometimes too daunting to attempt in a 2-hour film, but I thought it was well accomplished in City of God. Finally, the plot itself was simply an amazing and stark depiction of the violent reality that exists in the Brazilian ghetto, to the point that murder became even a normal part of daily life for young children. That's certainly a thought to chew on for some time.",

540,29 June 2003,froboz,10, Amazing film,"Amazing film about boys growing up as gangsters in a Rio De Janeiro ghetto. I haven't been there, and don't want to go! It is not a complete narrative about the ghetto, but a violent and living thing, full of machismo. You lack the perspective from the women, the peaceful children, the workers - those that kept everyday going through the mayhem. So it is in essence a gangster movie. Cinematically, and partly in subject, it reminded me a lot of the 1974 O Amuleto De Ogum. I saw little documentation for that one, but check it out if you have a chance - it saw it on swedish television ages ago, and it ""blew me away"" much as this one. There are also other violent argentinian movies, and I wish I could make a proper list, but I know to little. Maybe later. I see references to Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas...but these comparisons are misplaced. Especially, some young americans should learn not to call everything Tarantino. There's a story of gangsters movies, and there's a tradition of gangster movies, that go way back, and which is international. I enjoyed the movie fully, because of all aspects - actors, cinematography, the depiction of kiddie gangs, the brutality. It is genre perfect. But even a top movie, a 1o points movie, is allowed to be critized. I think that the playing with time - introducing scenes in advance, and making us confused, was unnessesary. Even if everything was nicely explained in the end, it would have better flow with straight story telling. I often wonder why gangster leaders are so irrational, like Ze in this movie. They just can't use those violent methods and expect to succeed. But I guess those sociopats are the one that leave most stories to be told after them.",

544,30 November 2015,kimberlymendez,9, Realistic and honest,"City of God captures the brutal life that is lived in the hoods of Brazil. From the beginning of Rockets flashbacks, you see the poverty that surrounds everyone; the small shorts worn with shirts that barely cover their stomachs or don't even have a shirt, the small houses crammed together that are falling apart, rusted old cars, and the run down shops shape the poverty of the town. There were only two ways to get out of it. One, leave the City Of God, but that's virtually impossible, as seen when Benny was preparing to leave but was shot. The other way, become part of the drug world and get to the the top. This is what Lil' Ze did, and what all children aspire to do. Ze, like many other boys, saw how violence and drugs would give people 'great' lives from a young age. Ze demonstrates how this lifestyle of a drug dealer ultimately is not your rise, but actually your fall. He was born in violence and died in violence. But the brutally honest part isn't in the amount of violence seen throughout the entire movie, it is the last scene that truly captures the horrors of the City of God. The kids that killed Ze, were now 'in charge' of the business that all kids want to be in, and as they walk away with guns in their hands talking about making a blacklist of all the people they are going to kill, you realize that this vicious cycle never ends. History will keep repeating itself over and over again with the next generation, and unless you have greater dreams in life like Rocket, you will become what everyone does, a drug consumed man controlled by violence.",

Be that as it may I wanted to write a review and this is one of my favourite movies to date. So on to the movie. The movie unfolds with an almost constant narrative by the main character 'Rocket' A young photographer who grew up in and around the slums of Brazil. The story he tells chronicles the events that took place affecting him, his family and his friends growing up. Much of the story details the violent rise and fall of several gang hoodlums from their childhood to (in some cases) their deaths. Fernando Meirelles delivers beautiful cinematography, capturing amazing detailed believable environments with excellent use of extras (many of whom actually live in the slums)creating a thriving busy Brazil, best exampled in the leaving party club scene.

The main character, Buscapé, carries the story through all of the little storyline changes and different perspectives.

Each character brings his own contribution to the story, the viewer forms strong bonds with many and an extreme distaste for others – it is like being transported into their world.

This is a place where one certainly does not have to look for trouble to find it.  Children grow up with a gun in their hand and a nonexistent conscience.

Really gets down into the nitty-gritty details of the street gangster life (at least as it was in decades past) in Brazilian slums. The subtle storyline shifts involving various characters throughout the film may be slightly confusing for some viewers, but the general focus is on Rocket (Buscapé), who wraps up the entire plot of the film nicely at the end. The plentiful violence is never gratuitous; it's always believable. Even when casual cruelty is depicted, it makes sense in the world of the story. In spite of the constant drug dealing shown throughout, it really makes your heart go out to the ghetto denizens of South America, and hope that things ultimately will change for the better there.",
556,22 September 2016,thmurphy-37414,10, Very Good Movie!!,"Out of all the movies made outside of the United States that I have seen, The City of God is by far the best. It is so interesting how easily everyone is allowing violence in their lives. It also seems like all of the older people are able to see past the drugs and focus on making their living through an actual career. Especially since no one would live long enough to be older than 50 as a drug dealer in Rio. As they would eventually be shot, or taken over, which would also lead to them being shot. It was also interesting how big of a role masculinity is to everyone in the City of God. They believe you become a man when you kill and do drugs, yet that just turns you down the wrong path, which leads to death. The age group for the drug dealers and everyone else associated with the business is anywhere from 6 to 40. A main theme in the movie was love, as Benny, Lil' Ze's best friend is going to leave the slums with his girlfriend and go live on a farm. He is shortly killed, and then the girl instantly leaves the area and is never seen in the movie ever again. I have no idea where she went, but she was also the main girl in Rocket's eyes. The main character who eventually earns an internship at the paper as a photographer for taking pictures of LIl' Ze and his gang. The movie was very focused on death as well, as someone was dying every 5 minutes, or someone was doing drugs every 5 minutes. Rocket stays out of the drug war and only smokes marijuana, as everyone else is doing cocaine and shooting everyone else. It is a very happy ending for Rocket, but not so much for all of the drug dealers, as they are all killed and the ""Runts"" take over the drug business in the end.",

The film is based on a true story and is an epic covering around 30 years. The story is told via the overlapping lives of several children who grow up to be gangsters.

Throughout the film, I felt a roller-coaster of emotions because it was packed with such complex human interactions and feelings. I hated all the violence, but I understand why it was necessary to be a part of the movie. The 60s and 70s in Rio and its slums were a crazy time full of violence and serious gang issues. The violence shown in the film added to the raw reality of the film, showed the craziness of the time period, and also helped to created empathy for some of the characters. I loved all the techniques that the director used to tell the story like the quick frames, split screens, photo lens, and backtracking. It really made the visual aspect of the movie very interesting and added a new layer to it. My favorite character by far was Rocket because he was a good kid who tried to stay out of the violence. All he really wanted to do was to take pictures, and I like how he used his unfortunate situation to help progress his future photography career.

One of my favorite parts of the movie was where they first found Knockout Ned on the bus, but then Rocket narrated that ""It wasn't time to talk about him yet. Another interesting part of this movie was watching the City of God evolve over the years. The city started as a dusty little town, but then evolved into a full on favela. Another key evolution in this movie was Lil' Ze's rise to power. He started off as a wannabe from the slums, and eventually became the most powerful gang leader in the City of God. A very powerful scene was the montage of Lil' Ze killing people. The POV of the camera was of the person on the ground being shot, and it showed Lil' Ze above you, holding a gun. Every time the gun would go off, the scene would change, and every time the scene would change, Lil' Ze would keep getting older and older. Overall, the use of Point of View and camera angles in this movie really helped to enhance the symbolism and gang violence in this movie.",

But it is all based on a true story, which totally amazed me when i found it out at the end of the movie. The only down side was that the plot caught a hold of me and kept me hooked, reeling me in for a great climactic ending. But when i got to the ending, I was sort of let down because it didn't seem satisfying or to be what I had hoped and expected for.

Also, I liked when the camera would show two different scenes going on at the same time before they converged into one scene. It was also strange to see how many scenes included drugs or sex. I did enjoy the character's of both Benny and Rocket. Benny was the kind of guy that everybody liked and I found myself growing attached to him. I had the same feeling with Rocket.

The only shame of making a film like this is how do you follow it? Well it seems a made-for-TV sequel is how you do it. Shame, but when a big film/TV studio offers megabucks to cash in on the fame of the original, it must've been impossible to turn away. Still, I have seen a lot of films over the last few years and nothing quite beats this. I cannot fault it at all - except that it did have to end.

Based on true events, the casting director has done a tremendous job in getting the actors who a lot like their real life counterparts. Fantastic direction and equally good actors. You can see what the upcoming splurge capital goes through. Even though it's shiny on the outside, there's still dirt (city's slum and drug infestation) underneath. The realism is high.

In the beginning of the film I was confused, because it showed the ending part of the scene, and then went back to the beginning, and told the story. The way that it changed from ending to beginning, and then replayed that scene at the end made this film very unique, and some American films are similar, but what makes this different than most American films is the language, and shows life in a different country during the 60's and 70's , and how the people there were living like, so I got to see a different perspective. Throughout this film, it talked about each character describing them, and went back and forth, which I thought was very distinctive. My favorite character in this film would be Rocket, because he did not agree with his friends and ""acquaintances"" in that they were involved in a gang and committing lots of crimes, and were doing drugs. Rocket found something that he was very passionate of, and that was photography. He used that in a way to escape the gang life, and separated himself of those bad ""acquaintances"". Even though he was there at the time of when shootings were going on, he tried to stay away from violence, by not actually killing anyone, and this showed who he was as a person.

The story flows fluidly as we follow the lives of young residents of this harsh social domain. The use of 'real' people to fill major roles in the movie is a piece of inspired cinema, with exact, mesmerising performances from the young stars. True, it is violent and very dark, but there are moments of black comedy that make this 'coming of age' tale highly watchable. It is as unpredictable as it is compelling and the film editing belongs in a masterclass of its own. Superb.",
576,18 June 2003,Jacobdk,6, Dissenting Opinion,"With nothing but rousing praise leading me into the theater, I should have expected such a disappointingly inauthentic and stylistically inappropriate film.  City of God is not half as depressing as others suggest, or as it should be, and the dialogue throughout is embarrassingly generic.  It had a glossy texture with doses of disturbing violence mixed into a mostly nostalgic and derivative coming of age story.  While I was never bored - there's certainly no lack of action or story telling energy - I never felt connected to these one-dimensional characters (except sometimes Benny).  People are introduced and killed off before we could ever feel emotionally connected to them (in this way the comparison to Pulp Fiction is valid, though Pulp Fiction was PULP, and this is supposed to be a meaningful film about the plight of street kids in Rio).  Overall, it's a big budget after school special. For a real film on the subject check out Bunuel's Los Olvidados.",

Unlike so many Hollywood films, where violence seem to take a recreational dimension, this film really gets to you. It makes you think twice about it, since it doesn't present dead bodies, but dead persons. A big difference in my book.",

579,10 January 2013,bjmorrissett,10," A stunning, harsh, and beautiful look at life in a favela","Well-off countries have a habit of sweeping the issues of small countries under the rug, unless helping them can benefit us. Some movies like to give you a look at what you're unaware of in the harshest way possible, and jam the issue into your face until you feel bad for not helping people in these conditions. This what City of God tries to do, and it succeeds admirably. Everything about this movie works to make it more powerful. The acting, the story telling, the directing, all make you feel like you're living in this world of filth, crime, and poverty. Many of the actors in this movie were actually from The City of God, a very crime-ridden and poor part of the Rio Favela. They embody their roles well because of this. They do a wonderful job of making small parts into interesting characters. Another crucial part is the story-telling. The movie is filled with flashbacks that give characters back-stories. These serve to not only inflate the narrative, but they help make memorable characters. The movie also juggles several stories at once, but manages to keep your attention and understanding. For instance, the final scenes deal with Rocket trying to further his photography career, Carrot and Li'l Ze going to war, a young boy killing Knockout Ned for murdering his father,the police being corrupt, and the Runts taking over. All of this happening at once helps to absorb you into the action on screen But the most important part, in my opinion, is the directing. Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund did a truly amazing job of filming even slower scenes to make them seem fast-paced and intense. The way some shots are done are inventive and almost fun to watch, much like the work of Sam Raimi. This makes the movie seem frantic and energetic the whole way through. So, this movie that I can't understand a word of and I bought for 3$ at my local video store impressed me beyond words. It quickly took a slot in my top 10 favorite movies, and should be regarded as one of the best foreign films of all times.",

This is an unflinching portrait of gang warfare in a Brazilian favela. It is a place crippled by competition for drug turf and in that competition life is shockingly worthless. Gun-squeamish viewers will not enjoy this film, as one of the key protagonists, Li'l Ze, emerges as one of cinema's most evil characters, dispensing with both ally and enemy with the carelessness of a child throwing away sweet wrappers. Any hope gleaned from the narrator, Rocket's, escape into a better world is diminished by the ease with which the baton of violence and worthlessness is passed onto the next generation at an age young enough for them to still be wetting their beds.

People like editors and cinematographers don't get enough credit. People always laud the director for his great accomplishments, but the average person doesn't realize how much of what they call direction is actually edition and cinematography, two things this movie is near perfect in. The shots are so perfectly composed and angled. They put you in a perfect perspective from which to view the movie, be it the eyes of the narrator or some omnicient bystander between a killer and his victim in an alleyway. The editing takes advantage of every moment, strobing during a tense fight or slowing the film just a bit, pausing movement and panning around so that you can see an entire scene. The control of situation is excellent. While much of that is owed to direction, I think that the cinematography and editing, aside from the great writing, acting and content, are what makes this movie for me. 10/10",

602,5 December 2016,magilroy,6, Great Film with many twists,"In City of God, directed by Fernando Meirelles, the idea of choices matter is very important. In the beginning of the film, the narrator, later revealed as Rocket, glorifies the trouble that is caused in a small city by his brother and two friends who were known as The Tender Trio. These three older boys would steal from gasoline trucks and other places, while causing no harm. One night, one of the Tender Trio brings their brother, known then as Li'l Dice, along on one of their missions and is instructed to stand watch. While the three nonviolent, older boys go into the motel and make a fortune, Li'l Dice satisfied his taste for blood by killing a majority of the people inside the motel after the brothers leave. After the aftermath, none of the Tender Trio survives the police brutality and the movie moves a few years into the future. Rocket then tells the story of L'il Ze. Rocket, who is fascinated with photography, chooses the path of a nonviolent bystander. L'il Dice, now known as L'il Ze, is a violent drug lord who kills without pity. From the guns to drugs to war, Rocket continues to show how he becomes a rising photographer and how the drug war breaks out in the City of God. In the end, Rocket becomes a famous photographer for all his action shots and exclusives in the drug war in the City of God. This movie appeals to many emotions has it builds up the viewer's attachment to characters in order to make a lasting feel when those characters are killed. I would recommend this movie to hardy individuals who do not become too attached to characters.",

Yes, the three were bad, but they never wanted to kill anyone. They only used their guns for hold ups, no killings. That was the case until a crazy little gangster named Lil Dice joined the gang and immediately went on a killing spree. Why did he do this? Because he was psychopath, that's basically it.

It develops in a flashback with alternate points of view that disassembles and exposes the parts of the cycle of violence which hasn't yet passed, at least not until the year 2015 when I write this critic. Foreign viewers can compare it to a documentary. For the Brazilian, it offers a production comparable to a great American action movie with good plot, but in a universe with which we can identify. The most shocking scenes can haunt some people for some time, but do not overlap in the movie, being well dosed with funny and uplifting moments. The pace is frenetic. The camera movement is agile and spontaneous, though it seems precisely planned.

The children in the city are exposed to guns and drugs before they even learn how to read and it becomes the only thing they know. The violence and treachery unfold in what is filmed as a party-like atmosphere, creating a palpable sense of indifference among the gangsters for the viewer. The movie was filmed on the streets of Rio with hand-held cameras and a cast that includes many unprofessional actors which makes it appear incredibly authentic, allowing the viewer to understand the reality of the situation.

He is the narrator, and it opens with him being caught in what appears to be a scuffle between a local gang, and the cops. But he quickly interjects, telling us as the audience how we won't understand unless we know the entire story, and so it begins with one of the most minor and clever tricks of the camera. These little bits exist so completely in this film, you hardly notice them, they work so effectively.

We learn in the film that regardless of what path you choose in life in the City of God, you're not safe. Your life is on the line even for being at the wrong place at the wrong time.",

642,21 December 2003,LatinoNoir,10, My personal favorite film of all-time,"Having watched this in the theatres, I can say that this is the best movie-going experience I've ever had. This is a masterpiece of filmmaking. The recreation of this true story and true to life depiction of life in Brazilian favelas is brilliant. The film is also visually stunning, with great use of color and camera work. Some of the very few detractors claim the cinematography and soundtrack glamorize the tragic events that transpire in the story...but they don't truly understand the filmmakers' message. The highly stylized cinematography and hip soundtrack only reflects the attitudes of the young men who live in these places. This is the best way these young men can look at the world around them. It's a fast and furious lifestyle and that's what the cinematography and soundtrack aspire to help recreate. There's absolutely no sign of glamorizing the violence in this film, however. This film gets my highest recommendation and I urge people to check it out. The region 1 DVD comes out Feb. 17, 2004 and will include a 45 minute documentary of the true story on which the movie is based. I hope it's not too late for the film to at least get Best Foreign Film recognition at the Oscars. If it were up to me, it would win BEST PICTURE, but that's not likely to happen. Lord of the Rings' ROTK isn't anything to sneeze at, unlike last years Chicago, though.",
643,16 October 2016,vikesh2295,9, I recommend watching City of God,"I think that the City of God was a great film to watch. The story line was good and very interesting because there were a few things in the plot where you don't know what was going to happen. Not to be very specific but some parts of the film were mysterious. There were a couple of different slow motion scenes in this film which also gives mystery and makes you wonder what's going to happen to this person that's being filmed in slow-motion. The film puts into perspective of how gang-related wars are around the world and how dangerous it is to be in the city that these gangs have taken over. The majority of the movie was filmed during daylight and in my opinion that is good because you as a viewer are able to see more things in daylight than the dark of course. The acting was done very well and it all seemed so real rather than formal. A lot of the camera shots were either close-up or medium shots which is good in my opinion because it helps the audience get a little more personal with the characters and really see the sadness and greediness of some of these characters. Even though the film is not in English it sets the movie's plot and story much better because, as i mentioned before, it gives a better perspective of life outside of the U.S. which can be really interesting as it was in this film. There was a lot of betrayal and drug dealing as well as killings of enemy gangs over territory, money, and guns. I would've liked to see more wealth in this film because wealth shows power especially when it is gang related. I recommend that you watch this movie. Overall I think this movie was great and I would watch it again.",
644,16 February 2018,fgfotocinema,10, A movie that was born classic,"I saw Cidade de Deus in a movie theater, just the week of the premiere. Although there were long queues, and there was almost no place to sit in the room (I only got a seat in the front row where no one usually sits), I was not prepared for the impact the play produced on me. In a clear language, and with direct images, but without being appealing, the film showed how the period when the favelas were idealized by the middle class occurred - after all, because they were in the hills, it was said that they lived there from the sky '- to communities where gun-to-mouth drug-trafficking shootings are a constant. Combining bluntness and good humor, Cidade de Deus is a movie that was born classic, and that only improves every time you review it.",

646,5 April 2006,ultimoteimoso,9, It's a great realistic film that tells the truth.,"I'm an American living in Brazil for 5yrs now. I watched the movie on TV the other night and was very impressed with it. The quality was very good and gives you the feeling of actually being there and viewing it first hand. The movie depicts life as it was and still is. The people here are generally extremely poor and desperate. The corruption within this country can be found in ever level of Government and under the table payoffs are a way of life for many. Life is cheap and large numbers of people across the country die a violent death every day. Drugs are prevalent and a big money maker for the drug lords. Every kind of drug can be found being sold on the streets. The poorest of the drug users use a cheap drug by-product which make them easy to identify as their front teeth are missing or black and rotting away. Others walk around sniffing glue. Certain areas of Rio de Janeiro are controlled by the drug lords and their followers just like it's depicted in the movie. They have a small army of very young children working as runners taking orders and delivering the drugs to the waiting customer. In those areas it's not uncommon to see even the children walking openly brandishing a firearm. Even the military and police hesitate to enter these areas as it closely resembles a war zone. What you will see in the movie, believe it, because it is NOT an exaggerated fictional movie. These things are happening in cities all across Brazil every day. On the flip side the majority of people here are very kind generous loving families. They are very religious are honest hard working people. The students work extremely hard to get good grades so they will be able to win a full scholarship to attend the best universities in the nation. Just because someone lives and grows up in a favela (slum) it doesn't mean they condone the lawlessness. Some do become great leaders in every walk of life. I can honestly say I know some of them and am very proud to be able to call them my friends. Watch the movie and I can guarantee you'll be stunned and left thinking about it for day with a sad heart that this exists in our world.",
647,29 March 2018,leginrenroc,9, Showing the Dystopic Undderworld of Normal People in Poverty,"Great Picture.

Everybody knows the game where a sentence is whispered from ear to ear to arrive back to its originator completely mutilated. So here's a plea for more originality (in both senses) in the subtitles.

657,19 July 2004,clintswift,10, Tough to Watch But Well Worth It,"Several times now I have gotten into discussions with people regarding this film.  The most common criticism that I hear is ""how could you watch children killing children.""  I have to say that it is a fair criticism of the subject matter of the film but not of the film it self.  This film is based on actual events that took place in the seventies in the slums of Rio. The film is brilliant at catching the desperation of some of the poorest people in the world.  For many people in the US this kind of poverty coupled with violence is unimaginable and the shock can be quite powerfull.  I applaud the filmmakers for artfully completing such a difficult task.  The cinematography is magnificent.  Alexandre Rodrigues beautifully does his part at portraying the difficulties that all teenagers face growing up (sex, carrer, frienship etc...) but with the extra challenge of having to deal with growing up with one of the most dangerous neiborhoods in the world. Over all a very good film.",

What I found to be most fascinating in city of god, and is easily felt on first viewing, was that even though the film is full of ""flashbacks"" it captivates you in a way that makes you feel the timeline is linearly moving forward. For instance, whenever a new character or a new place is shown, we're waiting for that ""the story of..."" and we're so interested that we forget about the current events taking place and indulge in the brilliant storytelling. We know this is a flashback, but we're in no hurry for it to finish so we can get back to the storyline. ",
660,25 September 2016,hazimmer,7, Cidade de Deus,"City of God struck a chord with me negatively for a few different reasons. My first reason is that the cinematography was shot in a way that, although brilliant, definitely gave me a headache. The beginning and end scene with the chicken are notable examples of this. It was really hard to focus on what was happening because of the sudden jump cuts, and this coupled with the loud, fast-paced music in the scenes were pretty off-putting. The other reason is that the violence in the movie was a bit much, but considering the fact that its plot literally revolved around gangs, I can't really complain. That being said, I really enjoyed this movie. I thought that the way the story was told from multiple angles was incredibly well-executed, and it was really fascinating to see the same scenes be shot and perceived in an entirely different angle than they had appeared just moments before. I have to give the team behind this movie credit where it is due, as I can't recall ever seeing any American movies that were filmed in this manner. The way that the two main characters Li'l Zé and Rocket are linked is quite interesting as well. Rocket is the younger brother of Goose, a gang member that Li'l Zé killed. Despite this, Rocket uses his photography skills as a source of income and to unknowingly promote Li'l Zé and his gang, who make their income off drug money. The method in which these two different stories are linked is really well coordinated, and give the movie more substance. ",
661,22 September 2016,brszasz,10, Great Movie,"I think this film is the best international film I have ever seen. The way they tell the story of each individual story separately while making it all come together is truly brilliant. It is very easy to get mixed up into the fascinating stories of these characters. I like dissecting the lives of gangs to see what that kind of life is like for a normal gang member. This movie went in depth about the lives of many gang members from a few different gangs. I also liked Rocket's perspective on the situation, because he is different from most who live in the City of God. Rocket is a smart young man who can get out of the crazy city and be successful with a good education. While most are forced into the gang life at a young age, Rocket stays true to his path of becoming a photographer without being involved with the dirty work of gangs. It was interesting to me how Lil Ze died. He ended up being shot by a bunch of kids who did not know any better, but this made me wonder that he could have been shot at any point during the movie. It begs me to ask the question of why wasn't he killed at any point during the movie when he was killing people himself all the time.",

The lead character explains what it was like being in the trio of ""bad"" kids from his neighborhood, running from the cops, and stories of his friends at a young age committing mass murder. Our main character finds solace in photography in opposition to gang-banging, which seems to be the norm the rest of the children fall naturally into. The story pans out to illustrate that no one leaves the gang or Rio De Janeiro for that matter, unless they're in a body bag. A structural system of family and friendship does not trump money or greed and is a beautiful picture of how these deadly sins abolish your life.",

678,7 October 2019,kasandravelasco-99486,5, Review of Cidade de Desus,"City of Gods, directed by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund, tells a story of life in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the area known as the City of God. This is an area of high crime and where drug dealers are running the streets, and where children are more interested in playing with guns rather than playing with balls. This movie shows how children killing other children is something normal. The movie does a fascinating demonstration of mise-en-scene, especially in the opening scene of a knife being sharpened on a rock to depict the danger of the area. This becomes significant because its a representation of how anything is used as a weapon in the City of Gods.The headless chickens are another mise-en-scene to signify the children running around causing chaos with their guns while the chicken that escapes is a representation of Rocket, who is looking for a better life outside the City of Gods.Throughout the movie there are fascinating shots utilized. An example, low angle shots are used to present the children stomping through the streets causing chaos. In these low angle shots their bodies are seen as silhouettes which shows faceless children who lives mean nothing. Another low angle shot is the children shooting the chicken to indicate power. There are many close up shots, one is the close up of Rocket and Lil Ze to display Rockets hatred towards him. Slow motion is utilized to Represent Rockets fear of Lil Ze when he is standing in the middle of the street between the cops and Lil Ze. There is also significance of color tones from going to a dark blue color which indicates fear and hard time to a yellow color which indicates calmness and happiness.",
679,13 October 2016,libbyr-60878,10, War on drugs depicted in Masterpiece!,"City of God is a masterpiece, taking a true story of the war on drugs in the slums of Brazil, combining it with local actors, a couple shoot-outs, and an outstanding soundtrack, this film stands up as one of the most influential foreign films of the 21st century. It's quite difficult to create a foreign film directed so brilliantly that the audience forgets they are reading subtitles from beginning to end.     The use of tilted shots creates the chaotic environment the characters are living in, for the audiences in the theaters, and also creates a sense of distortion, as if the character's portrayed are unstable, specifically when Lil' Ze is in frame. This allows them to feel as if there are with these kids: running away, selling drugs, taking a bullet, or smoking pot. The extensive use of color and quick cuts instead of fading from shot to shot, allows the audience to see an intensity in the film, vibration from story-to-story and character-to-character. The similar clothing colors of those in the slums, compared to the drastically different ones of the bigger city, show the relationship the slum characters have in common with each other, even though they are not the same people, they come from the same place. The one character who changes the most is Benny, who also most drastically changes his clothes the most drastically, coincidence? I think not!  The soundtrack is not one you'd listen to in your car, but the specific use of silence and sounds are noticeable. The explosions of guns during the shoot-outs from one end of the city to another is portrayed beautifully with the on-going action in the scene. The dramatic music played at the club Benny gets shot at is played to create suspense, as well as the strobe light continuously blinking, until we hear the gun go off.  The character's are so well-developed that anyone watching this film for the first time could easily give a summary of each named character, as well as identify with one.",
680,17 September 2004,Rancor-3,10, A real life story of terror and heart,"Let me begin with a minor rant: The front of the DVD case depicts a guy and a girl sitting on a beach, one kissing the other, and a group of hoodlums standing around, some holding guns, though that really isn't the clearest picture you see. The colors are warm. The tagline is ""15 miles away from paradise... one man will do anything to tell the world everything.""",
681,15 October 2016,mauricioherrera-12791,10, City of God,"City of God is, in my opinion, a complete masterpiece. Director Fernando Meirelles' use of a predominantly amateur cast (with some actors, including Leandro Firmino, the actor who played the role of adult Lil Ze, formerly living in the real-life City of God) allows the film to have a very real, candid showing of life within a dangerous slum. In a world where the most promising way of life is to rob, steal, and deal drugs, our main character Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) must try to remain honest and steer clear of the life of crime ahead of him. The film is a fast-paced brutal thriller that unapologetically depicts the real struggles of a life of poverty in one of Rio de Jainero's most dangerous slums. One of the film's greatest achievements is the complete submersion of the audience in the unforgiving world of the City of God, in order to establish a feeling of isolation and desperation, where danger lurks around every corner only to be completely contrasted with shots depicting the more stable metropolitan areas of Rio. This submersion is accomplished using many techniques. First, depicting the origin of the slum in the 1960's as more bright and containing only few criminals only to slowly descend into more violence and criminals, and more killing for the sake of killing in the 1980's. The intensity of the slum is shown with darker lighting, a funky soundtrack, faster cuts, and more firefights. For me, the reason this film succeeds so well is due to the fact that instead of the audience viewing the favela from a safe distance and experiencing feelings of horror because of how different it is from our comfortable lives, we are forced to live it as the real inhabitants do, to be completely submerged in the city with seemingly no way out, and that is terrifying in a completely different way.",
682,15 October 2016,jenniferemeyer,9, The City of God is the slums of Rio De Janeiro that shapes two very different boys as they grow into men on a collision course for disaster.,"The Directors, Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund, did an astonishing job of engulfing the audience into the movie. The use of tilted shots helps make the audience feel like they are a part of the gang trying to survive living in the City of God. The shots and editing also give it a very realistic and hectic feeling, which adds to feeling of being in the film. Like during the party, right before the killer attacks, the use of strobe lights and quickly cutting between people gives this intense feeling in the audience's stomach something bad is about to happen.

683,17 October 2016,emilybatara,9, City of God,"Fernando Meirelles' City of God (2002), is a remarkable representation of the slums in Rio de Janeiro during the 1960s through the 1970s. This film walks you through the life of Rocket, an aspiring photographer, who lives in the City of God and faces danger every day of his life. Throughout this film, Rocket tells the stories of the many different people who lived in the City of God and their journey which lead to their ultimate death or survival. This film captures the violence occurring not only through the presentation of deaths caught on camera, but by the fearful screaming, crying, and begging of lives. Where hearing the loud and painful sounds of guns being fired off and seeing bloody, mutilated bodies lying on the street is just another ordinary day. The setting of this film and the mise-en-scene allows the viewer to understand the struggles that the townsman live through, the rundown town, and the fight to stay alive.

685,17 October 2016,tlc-82217,9, An amazing story telling experience,"The City of God is an amazing film that portrays the lives of those living in Brazilian slums. The film focuses on a boy nicknamed Rocket and his struggle of trying to live an honest life in a dishonest world. City of God is told as a culmination of stories that focuses on different characters throughout the film. Multiple times it introduces a character as someone who isn't the main focus of the story, but later plays a big part in a different story. This style of storytelling made the characters interesting because the viewer has already met the character and is excited to hear their story in depth. City of God also has really solid framing with the story ending in the same place it started. The use of flashbacks also help tell the story concisely and reminds the viewer of important details that might have been forgotten. The camera work in the film is a thing of beauty. An abundant use of hand-held shots makes it seem like you're actually there. The opening tracking shot was particularly impressive as it followed a wild chicken through the streets. Whenever a new place is introduced, there is a nice exposition shot so the viewer has a good understanding of where the scene is taking place because a lot of the slums can look very similar. The acting in the film is pretty good considering many of the minor characters were local children in the area with no acting experience.",

687,29 April 2006,guster-1,9, one the best foreign films I've ever seen,"This is one of my favourite films of all time. The reason being is that as soon as I finished watching the film, I was compelled to watch it again straight after(the only film to have made me do this was The Usual suspects). It's very fast paced and it really sucks you in to the characters and their situations. The film gives the viewer a real insight in to what happens in this city and how life really is for it's inhabitants. ",
688,17 October 2016,tjstingl,10, Favela... A Vicious Cycle,"Tom Stingl *SPOILER ALERT* Directors Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund released the movie City of God in 2002 and is now known as one of the greatest foreign films ever made. Especially one coming out of Brazil. The film depicts the life of an average boy growing up in a fa vela and the birth of a tyrannical drug lord. This film utilizes the best out of the thriller, action, and drama genres of film, often times leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat for the majority of the movie and becoming truly emotionally attached to many of the characters.

689,16 May 2006,bbro3886,10, City Of God.... is the real deal!!!,"It is not a habit of mine to give movies a perfect score... but this one is just what movie magic is all about. Everything about this movie is perfect.... it just genius... The movie tells the story of a boy living in the slums of Rio DE Janeiro, Brazil AKA CIty Of God..... there life is tough and violent... even more for good people like the boy in this story... the only thing he longs for is to be a photographer and get out of the bloody neighborhood he is in where gunshots and violence are a daily happening. When two rival gangs start a full out war.. the boy decides to leave but it just might be too late for him........ This movie is a must see for any movie buff, although be aware it contains very violent scenes thus it is not for all kinds of people that said.. it is a great movie..... what adds to it is the fact that it is supposedly based in real events.... I do not doubt it as I have heard about the violence over there in South America is out of hand...... the DVD contains a documentary about Rio De Janeiro's gangs which will give you an insight into the sad reality they are living under over there. I give City Of God 10 out of 10",

692,7 December 2016,aimeereich-79524,9, City of god,"City of God is a great movie for countless different reasons. One thing this movie does very well is create an authentic, gritty feeling around it. It's been said that the director cast multiple untrained actors from various slums around brazil due to lack of professional Brazilian actors, and to create the same grittiness I previously mentioned. More than half of the movie consists of Gun fights between Knockout Neds gang and Lil Ze's gang. The story line is told very well, as it starts when rocket, who narrates the movie, is just a little kid, but not yet a big part of the movie. The movie really gets deeper into the story when Lil Ze, who at the time was called Lil Dice, kills rockets brother. The movie peaks however when fellow hood Blacky kills Benny, Lil Ze's best friend and partner in crime at his farewell party, as he decided to leave with his girlfriend. The acting in the movie is really good even though these actors aren't professional, and the story was well written. This is a really solid movie that i enjoyed a lot.",

Who would've thought that it would come in a foreign film, or in a true story? ""City of God"" ( ""Cidade de Deus"" ) is the story of a teenage boy living in one of Rio de Janeiro's slums, and he dreams of becoming a photographer. The boy's name is Rocket ( Buscape, in Portuguese ), and little does he know that his passion for photography would allow him to take his camera and look at his world through the eyes of a journalist who is able to capture on film what so many reporters had been craving for so long but were not able to capture. ... It's interesting that Rocket also is the narrator of his story throughout the movie.",

If you get your hands on the original reel ( which you should ), its very fast paced and does not matter at what point you start watching it, you would certainly find it intriguing. Though, I would certainly tell everybody to watch it from starting. Here are a few points which would tell you more about the movie: Interesting plot. Brilliant Screen play. Fast paced story, gives less time for audience to get out of the trance. Good amount of graphic content. Backed by fair enough acting. Dramatic events. Kinda motivational. watch it for yourself.

697,27 August 2012,Generalle_della_Rovere,9, One word: exhilarating,"Fernando Meirelles' poignant and somewhat bittersweet debut ranks among the greatest and most iconic films to be made. Cidade de Deus delivers a rather terrifying narrative of a person caught in the middle of two warring drug mules. The film's transition from chaos to utter stillness, the real to the metaphorical, escalated the feeling of disorder, panic, and euphoria. Interspersed with the story are tales of corruption, greed, innocence, and the primal nature of man. The film showcased the very definition of character development, with the flawless screenplay mockingly fixed  on the first person account of the protagonist, every character experienced several surprising twists in their personalities.",

Its obvious god never walked these streets or protected the children that lived there. It sure gives you another look at Rio. One that we don't see on the vacation brochures. Its very hard to imagine young children carrying guns and shooting other children in order to be part of a gang. It was a real eye-opener. And I'd like to know if the children in the movie were filmed live or if they were all actors? Did this movie receive any awards the year it was released?",

703,5 November 2003,stephan-9,10, Takes Tarantino to School,"This film takes Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie to school about how they ought to be making their own films.  Every technique and trick those directors employ are done in City of God with equal aplomb, so the difference is in the content and context of the story.   City of God does not take place in a slick fairyland of well-manicured, clever hoods, and it is not The Young Ones with guns.   Where Tarantino's and Ritchie's films employ a cynical, ""I'm so much cleverer than you"" device, this film instead uses raw emotion.  City of God says to the viewer ""this world is real"" in a way which neither requires you be in on the joke, and without looking down upon your priveledged life as if to say ""you could never understand"".",

The characters are well built, and in some cases even allow a psychological analysis, giving depth to the plot, involving from start to finish. City of God is a necessary film not only for movie lovers, but to all who wish to improve their social conscience and try to better understand the society we live in.",

Otherwise just wait till this comes out on video, and perhaps on a rainy december night when u cant find anything else in blockbuster to watch rent it. It will be cheaper as well.",

The movie was unrelenting and gritty in it's portrayal of two friends and the path they choose. One becomes a drug dealer the other wants to be a photographer.Despite it's very serious and grim story, the movie manages not to be depressing. There's ample subplots throughout the movie, all of which are good. The acting, cinematography, and editing are all up to Hollywood standards (the acting is above most new movies I would argue) Really I can't say enough about this movie.

The captivating camera shots make a truly fascinating cinematography.  Editing was brilliantly done with some Pulp Fiction influence added into it.  No single actor's performance particularly outshine the most, but the ensemble performance, from the street kids to the crime masterminds, is remarkably convincing! The screenwriter made the story so suspenseful, bold and daring, that you would not want to miss a single scene.  And the truly best aspect of the movie is its ingenious film making.  Watch out for the ""apartment scene"" where the genius director shows how one small apartment drastically transforms as its inhabitants change through the years.",
