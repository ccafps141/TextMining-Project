0,20 September 2015,Ed-Shullivan,10, Imagine yourself as a 5 year old child discovering for the first time a brand new world exists outside of your room,"SPOILER: At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival the film ""ROOM"" won the People's Choice Award today. It tells a story of a young woman and her five year old son who have been held in captivity in a confined and windowless living space for six years. Brie Larson stars as Ma and her son named Jack is played by Jacob Tremblay who is so believable that you will feel empathetic towards their captivity but relief as to how Ma convinces Jack that their little world is real and is wonderful.

2,8 November 2015,howard.schumann,9, A tense and compelling film,"Lenny Abrahamson's Room opens in a 10 x 10 room that has no windows, a locked door, and no light other than that provided by an overhead skylight. Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a slight five-year old boy with hair down to his shoulders wakes up each morning as he has all his life, saying hello to his world. He says hello, not to the sun or the grass outside his front door where he can run and laugh and play but only to the objects which is all his world consists of: the lamp, the sink, the plant, the refrigerator. His only friend is a mouse that he feeds with some pleasure.",e

4,2 February 2018,TheLittleSongbird,9, Claustrophobic beauty,"That review summary may sound very oxymoronic, but to me it applies to a film such as 'Room'. A film with a difficult subject, that is the stuff of nightmares, but tells it so beautifully with an interesting approach that works better than all the potential traps that films of its genre could fall under.",i
5,27 January 2016,bob-the-movie-man,9, Awesome film - shame about the trailer,"Room, based on the book by Emma Donoghue, starts on young Jack's 5th birthday. He gets a birthday cake from his mother (but no candles); a visit from his father; and a gift, albeit belatedly. This would all be perfectly normal except that all of this takes place within 'Room' - a confined space with only a single skylight for daylight and no means of escape. For the mother, Joy, was abducted as a teen and locked away for sex in the style of the dreadful real-life examples such as that perpetrated by Josef Fritzl in Austria. Jack is the (presumably) unintended result: a boy with no perception of the real world beyond his four single-sided walls and with the staunchly-held view that the things he sees on a flickering TV screen are in 'TV land' and unreal. Will Jack and Joy survive and ever see freedom again? ",e
6,6 January 2016,ryan-bfd,10, This one is gonna stick with me,"""Room"" is an adaption of an internationally best-seller novel written by Irish playwright and novelist, Emma Donoghue. This is her first book to be adapted into a major motion picture and I have to say that it is a rather impressive one. I have not read Emma's novel yet, but I can only guess that this movie sticks to the novel's roots, considering that Emma decided to write the screenplay herself. Room is a story about a women who was kidnapped during her high school years and locked in a shed for 7 years. She was impregnated by her kidnapper in this room and was locked inside with the child. The child grows up and around the age of five is when the movie picks up. Throughout this entire movie we are taken through this story strictly from the Jack's (the child) point of view. Even though this story is experienced through the lens of this child, the story is in no way filtered or gussied up. It is this intimate and raw story about a child and his mother spending a hugely relevant portion of their existence stuck in this dull, dirty and claustrophobia-inducing shed. This shed contained one small window that emits a tiny portion of daylight into the room. To me, this represented a light at the end of the tunnel. Sort of like a tiny glimmer of hope in a deep and dark abyss. Throughout this entire movie, Jack narrates his experiences as he embarks upon the world. Jacob Trembley portrays this character with such a sense of wonder and innocence that every single narration that I hear from this boy is just heartbreaking. Every time Jack takes away something from the world, he takes it in as something new and exciting even if it is scary. They are things that everyone takes for granted everyday: trees, dogs, the sky, etc. You would think that the dramatic climax would be at the beginning when Jack gets out of the tiny room he has been locked in his entire life, but after-wards, this film just drags in one dramatic scene after another in a way that turns this film into one big heartache an experience. I do have say that Jacob Trembley and Allison Brie's performances carry a lot of the weight of this film. Allison gives a very natural and organic performance. You never catch her overacting or being too stiff during any scene in this movie. Jack Trembley gave one of the most, if not the most, impressive performances of the year. Not just because of his age, but because of how well of a dramatic performance that he gives without over or underacting in any of his scenes. He seemed to take his role with a very adult-like seriousness that translated into a lot of the movie's themes of innocence that are chased by the persistent and harsh reality that Jack and his mother are facing. The directing and cinematography in this film are beautiful. The film's intense theme is complimented with a variety of out-of- focus and close up shots that highlight the child's immediate consciousness as he takes the outside world with fresh- eyes. Many of the scenes are also complimented by a beautiful and breathtaking film score composed by the award-winning Stephen Rennicks who has been crafting soundtracks in the indie film world since 1997. Overall, this is a film that I won't be forgetting for the rest of my life. Mainly because it is a film about escaping outside of the room that you have been stuck in your whole life and discovering a world that has been hidden from you. I know that sounds kind of cheesy but this film does it in the most grounded and intense way possible. Not to mention that it is dosed with themes of abandonment, human-kindness, and media exploitation. I don't usually give films a 10/10. As a matter of fact, I could probably count the films this year that I do consider 10s on one hand. The films I consider perfect are life changing in some way or benchmarks in cinematic history. While this film will probably be washed away by the ever expanding ocean that is cinema, it is not a movie that I will be personally ever forgetting. I can't remember watching a film that made me feel so grateful for just being alive.",w

When Joy has encounters with a man, Jack locks himself in a closet. When Jack is five years old, Joy tells him that she lived with her parents in a comfortable house and a man called Old Nick lured and kidnapped her seven years ago. Joy plots a scheme to let Jack flee from the room and call the police. When they are rescued, they move to the house of Joy's mother and they have to begin the adaptation to the routine of a normal life. But is it not easy.",/
8,20 September 2019,CubsandCulture,10, Jacob Tremblay gives one of the finest child performances of all time.,"There is a lot to admire about this film. The direction in the first hour and the final minutes, especially gets the most out of the concept and manages to make a 10 by 10 foot space seem like everything and eventually nothing. Likewise, the direction leaves much of the horror to the imagination and it is all the more chilling as a result. The screenplay is sparse and spartan in the way real life is around such horrific events. I like that several of the tensions in the story, i.e. grandfather's inability to deal with his grandson, are left unresolved. Finally Larson gives one hell of an understated, yet raw, performance that elevates the already strong material.",r
9,28 October 2016,kosmasp,9, Inside out,"But that title was already taken. Also Room is pretty accurate and hits ""home"" (no pun intended). But while I had no idea what I would get with this (apart from the title and the lead actress I didn't know one piece of information), most will go into this knowing what it's about. The general idea is explained fairly quickly, though the why of the closed space or rather location and the reason for staying might take a while to sink in.",w
10,2 January 2016,imdmt,10," Infinitely deep, an experience I will not forget.","*Insert all 9 & 10 reviews here* I was in awe during the entire film. Lenny Abrahamson & the writing team made sure there was not one dull moment. The addition of ""insignificant"" characters and plot twists are later realized to be so significant and influential in keeping the film alive throughout its duration. It was the little things that made this story one of the best I've seen in a long time. I experienced an entire palette of emotions all at once and was left in a deep level of curiosity and reflection. Very few films have the power to continue to influence its audience after the credits. Room is endless in the most beautiful way.",3
11,24 October 2015,mulandarkside,10, The best film I've seen in years: indescribable!,"I know one thing, I will never, ever forget this heartrending, unbelievably-acted 'movie' for the rest of my days. I'm just at a loss for words and struggling to describe how truly powerful and heart-grabbing this story was. I'll go so far as to say that if you don't cry, shed a tear, or feel the urge to weep profusely after (or while) watching Room, you don't have a heart. The mother (Brie Larson) and her son (Jacob Tremblay, 9 years old!) carry this entire movie. The beauty of Room is in its bare rawness, realness and universally relatable nature. What can I say? It tapped into something deep, deep, deep within me and just ripped my heart to shreds and had me in tears; sometimes tears of sadness, and other times tears of heavenly joy. It made me smile at times and even laugh. But most of all, it always had my eyes glued to the screen and my soul enthralled by what I was witnessing. This is one of the best, truly real stories ever told and one of the best uses of cinema I've ever seen. ...Try not to read much/anything about it before going in to see it (and yes, definitely catch it in a theater near you ASAP). Go in and be engrossed and moved (in ways I can't describe) by this experience. 10/10 *Hands down* the best film of 2015, and the single best thing I've seen in years. :')",3
12,21 August 2020,ivantheeditor,7, Incredibly real & disturbing. A bit slow though,"I really enjoyed this movie. Although it was a bit slow overall there were definitely a few moments where I held my breath. However, I feel like the movie should have focused more on the room and the escape instead of life after the escape. Once they got out it was quite boring. The movie should have just ended there IMO.",9

15,16 December 2015,fredf-67149,10, (Insert Expletive Here).... Perfect!!!!!,"Don't listen to the haters or those that want to chip away at the overall brilliance of 'Room'. What film doesn't have small flaws, they pale into insignificance during the 2 hours of continuous emotional maelstrom that follows. This film wrings every last drop of emotion and drama out of the allotted playtime. Make no mistake, despite short bursts of touching serenity, this films starts up full throttle and doesn't let-up. I can only assume reviewers here scoring this film 8 or less must be Vulcan by birth, or just terminally insensitive. This is a first rate drama with stand out performances all round. Especially from the child protagonist. ",1
16,29 January 2016,Turfseer,5, Disturbing abduction plot and subsequent redemption tale doesn't rise above the level of an average Lifetime Movie,"Room is based on the 2010 novel of the same name by the Irish turned Canadian novelist/playwright Emma Donoghue. The film has already garnered accolades from almost all critical quarters with heaps of approbation for its lead actress, Brie Larson. It's a rather uncomplicated story with a plot that is broken up into two distinct parts.",6
17,21 August 2016,Hitchcoc,10, Taking What Could Have Been Maudlin to the Stratosphere,"I hesitated seeing this film because I feared it would be another one of those exploitation films, with scene after scene of threat and pain. Considering a woman and her son have been kept for years in a room in a shed by a sociopath, this could have gone down that road, there are certainly elements of this. But this is about survival and hope, neither of which comes without agonizing risk. It's also about how people deal with things for which they have no true appreciation. I refer to two characters. The first is the father of the young woman. He must deal with what he sees as the devil's spawn. The second, a reporter that begins to malign her because she hasn't done what ""she"" sees as heroic. Her interview made me crawl, but I also thought this is exactly what we do to people who gain celebrity through pain. There is a great deal to be learned from this film, but I fear this is an eternal problem.",/
18,2 May 2016,Horst_In_Translation,8, 2 great performances and a captivating story,"""Room"" is an American 2-hour movie from last year. The director is Lenny Abramson and writer is Emma Donoghue, who actually adapted her own novel for the screen with this one. Both scored Academy Award nominations for their work with the Best Director slot certainly being the more surprising feat. The movie also got in for Best Picture and won lead actress Brie Larsen an Oscar, just like basically all precursors. Jacob Tremblay, however, was the real lead here and it is absolutely ridiculous that he was nominated for so many supporting awards. Voice-overs are usually a good indicator who is in the center of the story and we hear him at the very beginning and end for example. Also there are key scenes where we still find out about him while his mother is out of the picture, such as the successful escape or after his mother tries to commit suicide. But this should not mean that Larson isn't lead. She is as well, but only the second lead despite being credited first.",?
19,11 November 2016,brando647,9, ROOM is an Emotional Juggernaut; One of 2015's Top Films,"Lenny Abrahamson directed one of the best hidden gems of 2014 in FRANK, a strange little film starring Domhnall Gleeson and Michael Fassbender about an indie band getting an unpleasant taste of mainstream success. It was a dark comedy with some real emotion sown into it. A year later, Abrahamson returns with a new film where he goes straight for the heart with a vengeance in ROOM. This man is one of the best directors I've found for emotional impact, keeping in mind I've seeing nothing else of his work but the two mentioned. But there is no denying the emotional gut punch you get watching ROOM. Based on a source novel from author Emma Donoghue (who also penned the script), it's a disturbing (and eventually uplifting) tale told primarily from the perspective of little Jack (Jacob Tremblay). As the movie begins, Jack is awakening for his fifth birthday in Room, the only world he knows. He was born in Room lived in it all his life with his mom (Brie Larson). He's a relatively happy child who believes Room to encompass the entirety of the world. Except, now that he's five, his mom believes it's time for him to know the truth. Seven years prior, she had been tricked and abducted by the man he knows only as Old Nick, the mysterious visitor who comes at night while Jack's asleep to bring food and supplies. Old Nick locked Jack's mom in the little 11' x 11' garden shed and she's been trapped there ever since. Now that Jack is getting older, his mom wants him to help them escape to freedom.",r

25,17 February 2016,Tweetienator,1, Bored to Hell,"Sometimes there are these special movies - high ratings, lots of ppl loving them and you just wonder - is this the same movie Iam watching ppl are talking about!? I was just well bored, almost bored to a brain-killing stupor. The young kid played his role not bad but if I compare him with the little girl from the movie Hidden (I know, I know, different genres but at least the location/space/set for acting is comparable)- he's just okay. The one thing I was the whole time wondering - why the woman didn't just kill the guy in his sleep. Well I heard about Stockholm-Syndrome, but the woman didn't behave imo like a person with that ""kind of state"" would, but Iam no specialist here. Well, so many ppl praising and liking that movie so tbh they can't be all wrong - so just try that movie and see what kind of movie Room is for you. Btw - one very weak point of the movie is for me that I didn't attach to the mother and his son at all - I watched that movie with no sympathy nor dislike for them. Well, I rated it 1 because of all the legions of 10s, my ""real"" vote is a 4 but no more.",t

28,4 April 2016,SumanShakya,8, a Touching Drama on Desolation and Motherhood......,"Based on a best selling novel, ""Room"" chronicles the story of a lady and her son held captive by a kidnapper, who actually is his biological father, in a shed comprising merely a 10 X 10 room. For the boy, the room is the only world he has known. The only medium he can see outside is the skylight in the room. The story may sound a nerdy fiction; but the film focuses much on the psychological aspects and discovers the story of desolation and motherhood which comes vividly alive on the screen. There are few scenes in which the boy and the mother have screamed to each other which could have been avoided alas they were like the scenes demanding the Oscars. Nevertheless, the film won an Oscar for the best performance by an actress. The film avoids big star cast or sets; but still the film is rich in emotions, performances, and beauty. The film just beautifully portrays the perspective of a five year old boy who doesn't know the world for real except for what his mother has told him or what he has seen in the TV screen. The emotional attachment portrayed between the two is awesome. Brie Larson's performance doesn't yet equal the winning Oscar performances from Julia Roberts or Hilary Swank, but still she appears stunning and well portrays a petrified lady held captive for six years. Few sequences are pretty familiar, but there are certain moments in the film for which you are drawn to it.",r
29,13 February 2021,Ruskington,8, You probably won't enjoy a second of this but you absolutely must watch it,Horrifying and heartbreaking in equal measure. The astonishing performances from Larson and Tremblay make you forget this is fiction at times. Arguably one of the greatest child performances of all-time in fact. I was glad that not all the film took place in Room- I'm not sure I could have copied with much more of that.,v
30,29 December 2015,Rendanlovell,5, Room is not as good as everyone says it is.,"Room stars Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. It offers Larson her best performance of her career and Tremblay a break out role. While he may not quite get past the whole ""kid actor"" stereotype he is admittedly better than almost every other child actor out there today. Both of these actors are receiving some serious awards buzz right now, as is this film in general. This may be due to the odd nature of its plot line. A mother and child are stuck inside a room for at least five years of their lives. Trapped inside never once going out to see or experience the world. So, when they get out we watch as this child gets to see everything for the first time.",

32,27 February 2016,ironhorse_iv,9," Save some room, this movie will makes you think outside the box. It's a well-made film.","Prepare to cry, to feel, to be angry, and to cheer. This is one of those kind of films that will stays with you long after the credits roll. It's captivated. Not to confused with the awful bad, 2003's The Room, 2015's Room is an admittedly unsettling adaptation, based off, the novel by author Emma Donoghue of the same name. Room tells the story about two people: 5-year-old Jack Newsome (Jacob Tremblay) and his Ma, Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) living together in a single room. Told from Jack's point of view, the movie makes it clear that he's used to the idea of never going outside. What the audience knows that Jack doesn't know, is that he and his mom are prisoners, by a serial rapist, named Old Nick (Sean Bridgers). Now, on Jack's 5th birthday, Ma must finally tell him, the truth, so that they can siege the dangerous and heart breaking opportunity for her and Jack to escape. Can Jack cope with the decision of life outside of his own four walls; or will the room continue to be, his inner sanctum? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, Room really hit close to home. I had known people that went through similar trauma like this. While, this movie is hard to watch, it's a movie that needed to be seem, as it shows how to cope with the rest of your life after going through life changing event like sexual, mental, and physical abuse. Indeed, there is something worth discovering, outside, beyond these 4 walls. The movie is beautifully acted. Brie Larson is a tour de force. By far, one of the best acting of my generation, I have saw from an actress in recent times. You feel the love, angry, and dramatic heartbreak in every scene, she is in. After all, she essentially missed out on her formative adult years and was forced instead to raise a child in inhospitable conditions. You sense every emotional range of a mother whose young life was drastically altered at age 17. Not only that, but Larsen, well-mastered acting gives strong testament to the unsinkable bond between a mother and son, whose love propels them to rescue each other. I have to give credit to the young Jacob Tremblay, as well. Tremblay, in particular, is mesmeric. He has a lovable charm about him. I really felt like he was a son, I never knew, I had. That's how close, I got with his character. Both Larson and Tremblay make a remarkable duo. Another thing, I love about the film, is how accuracy closed, it was, to the source material. Screenwriter, Emma Donoghue didn't change much of anything from her novel. Inspired by real-life kidnapping cases like the Fritzl case, & the Jaycee Lee Dugard case, author Emma Donoghue was able to use symbolism, themes, and metaphors, from both real-life news, and classic literature to make a very well-written film. I love all, the references to Count of the Monte Cristo, Alice in Wonderland, and the Book Thief. Not only that, but all the Religious symbolism ranging from Sampson's hair to the villain, being called Old Nick, help make the character development of Jack, being told here, very believable. If the movie had any fault about Jack's story, it's the fact that many viewers were confused by, Jack's appearance. He had very long hair and very soft voice. Because of this, there has been elaborate and incorrect theories speculating that Joy is pretending that Jack is boy, to hide it from her captor. While the first half of this film was entertaining, it still lacked a lot of logic. Like, why didn't they just smash the window and climb out using their table and chairs? Also, how come Old Nick didn't see Jack when he was sitting straight up in the truck? Why would Old Nick just drop Jack like that? Those are really big jarring questions. If you think about it, it's something worth debating about. Thinking outside of the box. Another fault of the film is how it does feel a bit disjointed. It's kinda like watching two different movies. Filmed in two parts; the first half, is learning to survive and escape, your torment hell. While, the second half is learning to cope after the trauma has happened. Yes, I know, a lot of critics might think the second half, might had gone a little too long, and repetitive, but I believe, the movie is well-paced. After all, you rarely see films tackle character study after a horrible event. This was something new to me. Another person that deserve some credit, is director, Lenny Abrahamson and cinematographer, Danny Cohen. The movie is well-shot. I love the scenes where they showing time has changed. A good example is how the camera focus on, the skylight of the room. Another great shot, is the whole rug sequence. Wow, that was really intense. In my opinion, while, this movie is Rated R. I didn't see anything that was graphic. Most of the rape scenes, were not shown, and the film had no nudity. Even the violence, was tame. If anything, it's just the dark subject matter. However, I saw harsher films rated PG-13 that dealt with a similar concept. So I don't get, why this movie was Rated R. It makes no sense to me. Overall: This haunting and disturbing movie is amazing. Worth the price, checking out. I hope, many success for it, during Oscar season.",

43,2 January 2021,aidanratesmovies,10, One of the 2015's Best,"With stellar performances, fantastic writing from Emma Donoghue, and an altogether breathtaking story- Room is more than just a simple thriller, more than just a simple drama, and more than just another awards contender. It's a powerful, unforgettable, and emotional experience that hits home in every way you can think of. There is no doubt in my mind that Brie Larson deserves every award she got for this film. Some people criticize her online for her acting being dull, similar to what people did earlier in the career of actress Jennifer Lawrence, but after watching Room there is no doubt in my mind that she was perfect for the role and is capable of so much when it comes to work on the big screen. Jacob Tremblay also provides an emotional and core performance to the film as her son, Jack, and perhaps provides the best performance I've ever seen of someone of such a young age. His character can be a bit predictable at times, but Tremblay brings a life to it that would have otherwise been missed. The direction can be a bit broad or dull at times, but due to Donoghue's terrific screenplay and all the talent involved the film transcends its flaws and makes for quite a brilliant and very memorable experience.

There isn't a weak scene any where in sight and the result is two hours of magnificent cinema. It's rare that a film can succeed in so many different aspects. The drama throughout is second to none, taking the audience on an emotional roller coaster that is genuinely moving. There is a scene of suspense that Hitchcock himself would be proud of. The intensity in this scene would struggle to be matched by the absolute best action directors Hollywood has to offer today. I haven't been that on the edge of my seat in a long time. The script is also incredibly thought-provoking. The character of 'Jack' played by Jacob Tremblay delivers some truly beautiful voice-over work. If you truly listen to what he's saying, in context, you can appreciate just how much we all take for granted the small things in life. Behind everything else the film has a wonderful message.",
55,28 March 2016,magnuslhad,8, chains,"The kidnapping, incarceration and rape of children is incredibly difficult to represent authentically on screen. 'Michael' shows how damning the effect can be when genre demands are prioritized over authentic portrayals. The first half of Room offers up a subtly plausible account of how a young woman copes with appeasing her captor in order to avert his gaze from her son. The performances of Brie Larson and an outstanding Jacob Tremblay are crucial here. Jack craves affection but also explores revolt, and the parent-child bond is utterly convincing. Sean Bridgers as the captor Old Nick takes a banality of evil approach: this could be your cousin, your neighbour, your boss. When Jack escapes and Old Nick makes the decision to abandon him in the street, the way he throws the boy down completely conveys the psychopathic nature of the man. The second half of the film, about Ma's difficulty in re-adjusting to society, works less well. Her father is wheeled in then wheeled off in order to make a point about the difficulty of accepting his grandchild. The A-list casting here did not help - a more anonymous face in this role would have given it more of an everyday dark fear appeal. The ending is low-key, but is in its own small way triumphant, a full stop placed right where it was needed. These two characters will go on. They will heal. Thoughtful, mature film-making that stays with you after the curtain closes.",

It is extremely original, as we follow a kidnapped woman hiding the truth from her son by convincing him that the shed they are trapped in is the whole world. We see the movie from young Jack's perspective, which I think was the right choice, he made the tone more light hearted and heartwarming, taking away from the reality of their situation in a way that feels peaceful, albeit somewhat surreal, as we experience a very unique view on the world. I did think we could have seen more of Joy's father, who is portrayed terrifically by William H. Macy, for only three scenes, they clearly had a complicated relationship and I left wanting to find out more, it is probably established fully in the book. The performances are outstanding, Brie Larson is entirely engrossed in her character in a way that would be frightening for most actors, but she did it without half measures, and the chemistry between her and Jacob Tremblay is absolutely brilliant, it is very tough love, which makes it real.

The IMDb synopsis also makes you believe that you are being taken on a journey - of the struggles of being held captive, into the psyche of the captor, of the innocence of childhood, of motherly love that triumphs. You probably imagine some sort of ""Life is Beautiful"" unfolding in a room. But NO! Be warned. This movie is about an annoying kid and his annoyed mom stuck in a room. They both manage to escape the room and guess what? They continue to be annoying and annoyed. The characters are so completely one dimensional, the movie fails to both entertain or be insightful. You end up feeling stuck with the characters in this 2 hour long ordeal. Like someone dragging a fingernail on a chalkboard.

66,4 September 2020,andrewhumphreys9968,8, Room - 8/10,"Engrossing, emotional and ultimately endearing, Room follows a mother and son who, after spending 7 and 5 years respectively in the titular room, must re-adjust to family and society. Brie Larson is good as Ma and does an excellent job at portraying her anguish and grief. As the viewer you can only imagine what must be going through her characters' head, but it's Larson that really sells the distortion and her performance demands emotion. Jacob Tremblay is the most impressive by far, being only nine at the time of filming, who plays the son, Jack. It's really interesting to see Jack's perception of the room, or just Room, as it's the only place he's ever known. You'd expect him to be more open with the outside world, but his drastically sheltered life makes it a slow process as he's used to his creature comforts. Tremblay does a really good job at selling his emotional scenes too and I enjoyed his pieces of narration throughout the film. The soundtrack was okay, it worked really well for the emotional scenes, but some of it felt a little too grandiose for the scene's it was played over. William H. Macy's an amazing actor and whilst I feel he was the slightest bit underused, his character and role in the story still made a strong, emotional impact. The mother-son relationship that runs through this film's core is what makes it so endearing, despite their predicament, Ma still does her best to give Jack as normal a childhood as she can and she does her utmost to shield him from the real horror of their situation. Glad I finally checked this out as it's been on my radar for years, was definitely worth it and I'm looking forward to starting the book.",

What is remarkable about this movie is that the audience members didn't fall asleep for the first half of the movie and that's a great thing. Unlike The Diary of Ann Franke (1959), the underlying and ominous tone of Room doesn't have the constant and imminent death threat from Nazi occupation that helps to sustain the visceral tension that Ann Frank was subjected to. Instead the director was confronted with the challenge of somehow making the mundane and likely boring life in a small room something of modicum of interest. In a way, the audience experiences the same efforts of the mother to keep her child preoccupied as much as possible with the few resources possible. Overall this movie has a deliciously balanced and sustained plot development often times left out of the confined and happily released plot outlines of most mystery thrillers.",

But this one is different because it is narrated through the eyes of five- year old Jack who was born in a fortified shed with only a small overhead skylight visually connected to what is outside his world called Room. His mother was abducted at seventeen and has been a captive for seven years, raising Jack as best she can in a co-dependent relationship that shines beautifully in their small prison. When tormentor Nick loses his job she knows he will not keep them alive, and that's when the slow-paced narrative opens predictably towards a fast world full of frighteningly wonderful sights and sounds and feelings expressed through the naivety of a newborn five-year old.",

Oh and her parents also couldn't be more unrealistic, they don't even get surprised they found their lost daughter.

88,25 February 2017,sol-,6, The World,"Abducted and held in a backyard shed with a young son fathered by her captor, a young woman attempts to escape in this grim drama starring Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Some of the finer plot details do not quite add up (in seven years of captivity, she should have been able to work out a four digit security code) and the first half of the movie is a tad repetitive. Things gets more interesting in the second half though with the escape plan in action and superb point-of-view shots as we literally and metaphorically see the world for the first time through the young boy's eyes. Tremblay is excellent as the youngster in question; not all his temper tantrums ring true, but he is great in the quieter moments in which he simply sits back and observes. In fact, the film is more about Tremblay than Larson even though she was the one who garnered all the awards attention. With all the focus on Tremblay though, several plot points feel undernourished; an impending trial, having to eventually tell Trembley who his father is, and acceptance of Trembley into the family are all issues that are mentioned once or twice and then later forgotten. Some have complained that the film runs too long but the ending comes as abrupt if anything with so many avenues left open. The uncertainty is arguably fitting though, and with two very solid lead performances, this is a hard film to look away from, but its resonance will vary depending upon how one feels about all the issues and ideas here that are unexplored to make room for its depiction of a boy seeing the world for the first time.",
89,16 April 2016,brchthethird,9, A compelling and emotionally engaging examination of a touchy subject,"I'm a sucker for emotional dramas, and even more so if they deal with difficult and/or sensitive subject matter. ROOM is both of those things and does so in a tasteful fashion. I also haven't been so emotionally invested in a film since probably PRISONERS. The story revolves around and Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Ma (whose real name is Joy) was abducted as a teenager and lives in a garden shed, affectionately (or not so, depending on how you interpret it) referred to as 'Room,' with her now-five-year-old son, Jack. When the opportunity arises, Jack escapes and the real meat of the story begins. First off, I was very impressed with performances in the film. Brie Larson does excellent work, but I was even more surprised by Jacob Tremblay. Even though he's quite young, he was able to convey a dramatic range that, although suiting the role in particular, sometimes isn't achieved by older actors. Playing someone who's spent his entire life in captivity, he portrayed the wide-eyed curiosity required as well as the confusion in someone whose perspective on the world is fundamentally changed. There were a number of intense and/or emotional scenes, and he nailed every single one. I also liked how, even though the story deals with women who have been abducted, there was a bit more going on under the surface. Separating the narrative from the obviously horrible situation in which a woman is raped repeatedly, you can see the film also dealing with the psychological effect when a woman has motherhood thrust upon them, the culture shock when someone who has lived in isolation comes into contact with the ""real world,"" etc. There was a lot going on than a simple escape from captivity, in other words. The only issue I could possibly come up with is that the second half of the film doesn't quite live up to the suspenseful first half. Once mother and son are freed, the narrative drive is somewhat lost, or at least goes into a holding pattern for a while. The difference in pacing is noticeable, although I wasn't terribly bothered by it. And, the film wraps up in a satisfying way anyway. All things considered, ROOM is an extremely compelling story that will have some people reaching for a tissue. It has great performances, cinematography, score, etc., and is certainly one of the best films of 2015.",

Factoring in all those folks, and the poor, article-challenged audiences wandering into the wrong screening carrying spoons and bellowing ""YOU'RE TEARING ME APAAAAAAART, LISA!!!"", it wouldn't be a surprise to consider Room a hard-sell as a carefree Friday night at the movies.

This is current, has happened, etc. I just don't need to watch the detail of it including the emotional pain etc. This is not a story that needs to be told it is a story that we need to prevent in the real world. It is not entertaining, just exceptionally depressing. The possibility of harm to the child by the captor is in no way exciting or interesting to me.

Most impressive about this film is how much thought the writer Emma Donaghue put into her screenplay, not made easier and probably harder by the fact she also wrote the source novel (a surprise and must-read to me!). With help from Director Lenny Abrahamson the film is finely crafted not to waste a word or a moment to embellish the story and suspense. It would be very easy to veer into pathos, melodrama and voyeurism to stir up emotions but such temptations are well avoided. The thrilling scenes in the middle of the film are standing alone worth the watching. The dialog and screenplay skills become most apparent in the second half of ROOM when experiencing Jack's emotional, physical and verbal responses to a world he is unfamiliar with. most apparent in his almost humorous but curiously on-point descriptions of everyday behavior and encounters.

Full of absolutely heart-wrenching moments and yet ultimately positively life-affirming, Lenny Abrahamson and Emma Donoghue have written and directed a true masterpiece.

110,29 January 2016,matthewssilverhammer,8, One of the Best of 2015,"How many times in your life have you been forced to finish a bad movie, book, or story, all the while just wishing it would end? Rarely is that longing as desperate in our reality as it is for the characters in Room. When Jack screams at his Ma, ""I want a different story!"", you know there's more to it than just a hunger for a different bedtime yarn. Her response, ""No! This is the story you get!"", punctuates their situation, and ultimately our own desires, with such force it nearly knocked me out. Room, a powerhouse of horrifying drama and real-life suspense, breaks out from its confining premise with enough gentle moments of love to make it one of the year's best. If you can't tell, I'm being careful with the details of the plot. However, know that it's a setup that's about as bleak as one can imagine. Director Abrahamson (maker of the criminally underrated Frank) creates an atmosphere of intensely palpable desperation in his small sets. In lesser hands, Room could've been either an oppressively gloomy downer or dishonestly optimistic hack-job. Instead, it's both strikingly candid and beautifully grace-filled This compassion for its subjects is thanks in no small part to the much-deserved-Oscar-nominated Larson, and young actor Tremblay. His character, in particular, presents such a powerful look at childish naïveté, he gives us one of the most amazing examples childhood trauma and perseverance I've ever seen. That theme (determination through suffering) creates an experience that harbors as much exhilaration as it does tears. Piercing and gut-wrenching, Room is a film you may want to escape, but will be glad you endured.",

But that, of course, is pretty short-sighted. My wife thought I should watch it even if just to see Brie Larson in her Oscar-winning role before I went to see her as a big-budget superhero in Captain Marvel (2019), so we watched Room on Netflix this week.

He is Jack and this room is his world along with his mother Joy. She raises him within that room heightening his imagination with various activities until bedtime in a closet. Nights are chilling because that is when Old Nick returns. He keeps them locked in this room and abuses Joy who protects Jack. When all seems lost Joy schemes a plan for Jack's freedom and the result is a spectacular yet intimidating image of adapting to a bigger universe. Director Lenny Abrahamson does an intriguing and detailed job at showcasing this outside freedom from both perspectives and how both Jack and Joy adapt differently. Brie Larson has become one of the most dependable talents with a resume of diverse roles. This is Larson at her best as she struggles to raise her son within confinement and then prepare him for an escape into an unseen world. Sean Bridgers plays Old Nick whose footage is brief but important as his sadistic choices become clear. Joan Allen plays Joy's mother who eventually introduces Jack to his very first hair cut. Tom McCamus plays her second husband, Leo who accepts Jack when his grandfather cannot muster up the ability to look at him. This is a powerful and emotionally charged film about motherhood at its most extreme.

It is a very intimate story that creeps up on you and leaving you pondering for days. The movie refuses to use cheap emotional tricks or graphic violence or scares to draw you in.

122,26 November 2016,moonspinner55,6, Excellent acting and an expressive eye help make the film a moving experience...,"The first 45 minutes or so of ""Room"" are awful to sit through. While those minutes are crucial to the rest of the story, seeing how a grown woman and her five-year-old son survive while locked inside a 10ft. by 10ft. outdoor shed is a tough task for any viewer. Director Lenny Abrahamson and screenwriter Emma Donoghue, adapting her own novel, free the captives (and the audience) before too long--and yet, mother and son's new life in the suburbs is nearly as uninteresting as life in that shed (I'm not sure this is intentional). Thankfully, Brie Larson's Oscar-winning performance as the exhausted, anxious (and guilt-ridden) single mom facing a strange new world is riveting on occasion, while the (not implausible) center of the story--an awakening, if you will--is emotional, if never quite fascinating. As an acting exercise for this cast, the material must have looked like a godsend. Abrahamson is careful with his actors; he allows them to think and breathe and hurt and heal. But all this drama could take its toll on an impatient audience, so personal judgment will have to dictate whether or not the movie is a success. **1/2 from ****",

But of course the members concerned have long banished the word justice from their collective vocabularies as I predicted right here on IMDb back in November, 2013, when I said in my review of Short Term 12 that neither Larson nor the excellent movie would even be nominated.

In a perfect world everyone involved in Room from the Head Honcho right down to the guy who carried beer would be recognized for their contribution to one of the finest movies of the year. Okay, the people responsible for nominating actresses got it right for once but, as if to compensate they failed to even nominate Larson's remarkable co- star Jacob Tremblay.

I was very impressed at the way this film was played out and was delivered. Imagine being a five year old boy who has only known an enclosed room his entire life and then escapes and live through the aftermath of it. This sets the stage for a brilliant film. At times I did want Ma (Brie Larson) to whip Jack (Jacob Tremblay) during and after the imprisonment and I did find myself getting angry with Ma (Brie Larson) after their escape.

129,5 February 2016,PrashunChakraborty,6, A very average affair,"There it is the first movie of the award season which I did not think much of. Don't get me wrong it's a decent but thoroughly average film. The movie starts out promisingly and does a couple of things right, makes no mistakes but does nothing special or extraordinary with the situation. I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt and was hoping the psychological aspects of the film would step up in the second half but it didn't do so, the second half completely changes the situation for worse, there are new problems to deal with and the movie goes about them in it's usual half committed way which was prevalent in first half. The acting is definitely the strong suit of the film, Brie Larson is amazing and I would be OK with her winning the Oscar, though I didn't think much of the film I thought she was great. The kid played by Jacob Tremblay showed amazing depth and variety for a young child. The weakness of the film is direction, it does not capitalizes on it's setting, it has no great scenes and does not visually grab you at anytime (I am not reading a book I am watching a movie), also sometimes Brie Larson's character is quite inconsistent and unrealistic sometimes, she shows very few signs of PTSD, it sometimes feels she was trapped in Room for weeks not seven years, not her fault though, another misstep by the director, along with not capitalizing that Jack maybe better off without Joy (it touches so less on the REAL issues it's infuriating).",

Surely the dramatic case of a woman kept in a room for years, and raped, especially if we think that's a real story, creates empathetic feelings for us; but this point is also a way to explore how a kid - taken just as a new born human being - can build his own mythology basing his considerations on what he can find in his world, that's simply a microscopic room. After the exit the difficulty to consolidate human relationships demonstrates the delicate period of exploration of another world that doesn't necessarily coincide with the first one. A movie that mix psychological topics (the strange relationship between mother and son outside their constricted but familiar world) with metaphysical questions about origin and kantian demands about perception of reality. Amazing.",

133,16 May 2016,leonblackwood,7, Brilliant at the beginning but dies down towards the end! 7/10,"Review: I really enjoyed the beginning of this film, when Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay), were living in a small room with no access to the outside world but the second half of the movie took away the originality that was set at the beginning. The acting is superb from Brie and Jacob and you can't help rooting for them, when they were plotting and executing there escape but it was sad to see how the whole ordeal took its toll on Ma. The way that Jack's character was written, was perfect and for such a young boy, he really did bring realism to his character but I would have liked to have seen more scenes of them in the room, which was the most enjoyable part of the movie. It was amazing to see them make the most out of everything in that little space, including the mouse and the little birthday cake, so it wasn't surprising that it took so long for Jack to adapt to normal life. That wasn't the same case for Ma, who was locked up for 7 years and forced to have sex for food but I have to commend her for bringing up Jack under such abnormal and cruel circumstances. When she eventually came to terms with what she had been through, it was good to see her back with her little boy but I'm sure that it's something that will stick with her, for the rest of her life. Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie and I'm glad that it got all of the recognition that it deserved. Original & Enjoyable!",
134,17 November 2015,pwiener-592-552778,1, It doesn't get any worse,"It opens badly, but this is deceptive. If you watch carefully, are very, very patient, look at what's actually there, and give it three minutes-----it gets worse. But wait. This too is unfair. Are you actually seeing what's in front of your eyes? Are you sure? The film demands that you give it at least another ten minutes, and you do. And as soon as you do, it gets worse. After that it gets worse, and then worse, and worse, and worse. And it's only just begun. The setting hasn't even left the room. Then it does. Finally. Surprise! A goodly portion of the film, in fact, at least 30 percent, takes place outside the room. I have no idea why. To show that the outside world is just as claustrophobic? That would've been a good point, but the story doesn't allow it! The writer is adrift. The shift of scenery doesn't help. It makes Room even worse - and it gets worse yet, and even worse than that, despite the brief, welcome, charitable appearance of two superbly talented actors (William H. Macy and Joan Allen) who can actually act, whether they have a character to play or not. Acting, in fact, is not an issue in the movie. To be fair, the child star of the film, Jacob Tremblay (made deliberately genderless as only a 5-year-old could be) gives as execrable a performance as any adult ever has, and deserves a lot of credit for it. If the director intended it that way, he probably either has no children, or doesn't know or like any. It's not totally Tremblay's fault: he obviously found it impossible to believe in the story, as did the writer, director, actors and producers who concocted this infinitely boring, one-dimensional, unfelt drama. Here and there throughout the story, that sickly, treacly piano that has invaded the soundtrack of hundreds of anemic films like a skin rash makes an appearance. To top it off, Room is made with the highest of production values. They are the only values visible, and may lift the movie to the heights of Trumpian emptiness. Americans love nothing better in their movies: production values are the new family values. The overall impression is of a movie, clunkily directed by Lenny Abrahamson, written by someone (Emma Donoghue) whose entire experience of life must have been acquired in a room, probably a classroom, possibly a cloakroom, a writer unashamed to display her bad handwriting, and constitutionally unable or unwilling to share with the public how little she knows or cares about the world she inhabits. A lot has been written about the hell the cinematographers went through to make parts of this movie, jamming their equipment into a tiny cramped space for countless hours. It doesn't show, and what does is not interesting. If they'd shown us the hell, and not the Room they made of it, I'd have had a lot less to say but would've left with more than a craving for a quick burger on my mind.",
135,24 October 2022,jgcorrea,1, Scandalously considered one of the 200 greatest films ever made,"The plot seems to have been inspired by 2 real stories. First case: Jaycee Lee Dugard, 11, abducted in 1991 from South Lake Tahoe, California, who was held captive for 18 years on a patio porch similar to the one in the movie. Second case: Amanda Berry, who gave birth to a child of her kidnapper Ariel Castro. But, although it touches on the problems of Stockholm syndrome and Pavlov's reflexological theories, Room's script does not ""decide"" on a definitive diagnosis for its main characters. Audiences today, in part, are those whose outlook on life has become so complacent that they have lost any sense of wonder. The monologues are short, banal and... childish! (What do you expect from a 5 year old anyway?) The 2 hours of the movie - which could have been condensed into 80 minutes and I would have felt less manipulated - feels like 3. Aside from a small underlying horror plot line, NOTHING happens. It's a film about nothing, without a great deal of insight into the causes of human suffering, without any insight into the captor's psyche, without details about the separation of grandparents, without a real weighty role given to a potential character like the psychopath. The protagonist does not provoke empathy, but that's minor. In the good versus evil duel, I always side with the actual victim.",

138,11 March 2017,sunchick116-872-583383,9, like watching a really good trainwreck.,"there are those films, like 'Schindler's list', that as magnificent as they are, only one viewing is all you can handle. this film is so brilliantly and subtly done, I can sit through it over and over. it is emotionally exhausting, yes, but also SO rewarding. everyone in this film brings their A game to this film, particularly Jacob Tremblay, whose acting ability and vulnerability makes the movie especially Beautiful. Academy Award Winner Brie Larson is exquisite as Ma/Joy, a complex, complicated, nurturing mother but also brutally traumatized kidnap victim and sexual assault survivor. At first I wondered what people were talking about when they said Ma was 'such a good mom' to Jack, as she has her bitchy moments almost from the start of the film, but then i stepped back and realized I'd be that way too. To expect the character to come away unscathed is just unrealistic, but for the years she's in Room, she does a great job sheltering her son from the realities of life until its unbearable. To the people that say Jacob was robbed of an Oscar nomination at least, i would agree, but i would also remind them that doesn't mean Brie's win was not deserved. Her character was MUCH more complex. It's easy to play a kid unaware of a situation, its much harder to play a character that has to deal with the trauma of an event once they're free, and they've got other people watching their kid, so they can just fall apart. I know a lot of people worry about this film and what you see, but as its from the son's perspective, you don't have to worry about anything gratuitous. A Gem of a film I wish everyone would see!",

152,15 March 2019,jchen-07237,10, Leaving You Breathless...,"It's hard for me to fully express the staggering impression that Room left on me using only the written word, but I'll have a go at it anyway. First I'll say that it's hands down my favourite film of the year thus far, and I left the theatre with many emotions swelling in me, affected in a way the only a small group of films have been able do for me. It's a patient, mature study in psychology and a sweeping symphony of complicated emotions revolving around a terrible, tragic situation that seems like a well of hurt and pain until in climbs it's way out into a tenderly heartfelt, incredibly life affirming resolution that never dips into half assed melodrama and feels earned and appropriate. The film casts such a powerful spell that it briefly changed the concept of time for me; Upon arriving near the end, I felt as if years had actually passed for me in theatre since I embarked on the film's journey. The camera, script and actors kept me so intimately close to the characters for the duration of the piece and made me love and care for them so much that it brought me right into their timeline with an intimacy that rarely happens for me in cinema. Now on to the actors. What brave, compelling work from every single performer on screen, right down to the bit parts. Every role castes with a sharp eye for detail and reverent contemplation of who is right for what, creating a roster of heavy hitters and up and comers to be reckoned with. Brie Larson gives a beyond award worthy turn as Joy, a girl who was kidnapped at a young age and held captive by a horrible man (Sean Bridgers, displaying smouldering volatility in terrifying proportions) who impregnates her. She raises the child in the dour, tiny garden shed he keeps her in. Faced with the unthinkable task of creating a nurturing environment for her little one, she tells him that the shed is 'Room', their kingdom, and that the people he sees on their little TV are fake, imparting that they and their captor are the only real ones and there is no outside world. This reminds just how mouldable our minds are when we are small, and the film beautifully explores the psychological ramifications of how we raise our young, how nature vs. nurture comes into play in startling ways during the darkest of times, and the decisions we are forced to make on our own to ensure that our children are safe, even when things have gone beyond wrong, as they have for the poor girl. Old Nick, as she nicknames their captor, rapes her every few days, and treats the two of them like animals. Her son Jack reaches an age where escape becomes vital in his mothers eyes, and she takes her chance, orchestrating a harebrained ditch effort to break free, which is my favourite sequence of the film. It's also one of the most tension filled, seat gripping scenes I've ever seen, as the character buildup has set our personal stakes epically high, which combined with the excellent set up makes for a clammy nightmare of an escape. The director makes the fascinating choice not to use any music at all until they reach freedom, which I noted. As soon as they are out, I let out a cathartic, audible sigh of relief, as the dank hell they undeservedly spent almost a decade in gives way to a vibrant, strange new world for little Jack. The camera takes his perspective and pores over every aspect of the outside realm with the patience and curiosity it takes to place us in his psyche, a child viewing the world in its entirety and true form for the very first time, essentially a second birth, a theme which the film handles marvellously. I must speak about Jacob Tremblay, a Vancouver native who plays Jack and gives the most soul wrenching performance I've ever seen from a child actor. The levels of sheer intuition and innocent truth he infuses in his work at such a young age are just unbelievable, and he should be in the riding for Oscar gold as well. Larson and him have uncanny chemistry, the love shown in the early scenes a blooming Rose of hope that fends off the looming darkness they dwell in, which is tested by the inevitable complications they face upon entering the real world once again. Larson burst onto the scene with 21 Jump Street and Don Jon, fun but inconsequential fluff. Here she shows us that she means business, and wants to tell stories that are important, and show audiences what it means to be human through her work. I look forward to where this extraordinary girl takes us in her next cinematic journey. Joan Allen makes subtly heartbreaking work as Joy's mother, William H. Macy is briefly present as her Dad, Tom McCamus makes compassionate work of her stepdad and like I said, everyone else is superb, right down to the day players. I was crippled by emotion and raw with nerve jangling suspense after this one, exiting the theatre soaring on the high I eternally strive for in my cinematic adventures. The fact that only one theatre in Vancouver is playing this one is an affront to the universe. Get down to Tinseltown and see this one before it's gone. You'll thank me.",

Best film of the year hands down.,"When the book Room came out I felt some reserve; for a writer to be using the Fritzl story (which it was allegedly based on) for personal profit seemed wrong to me, so I never bought or read it.

155,5 September 2016,phd_travel,4, The true stories would have been better than this fictional movie,"I watched ROOM because I'm a fan of Irish director Lenny Abrahamson, that's the only reason. The premise didn't really appeal to me, although I'm aware that it's based on various true stories about long-term captivity; if I'm honest I'd rather watch a documentary about one of the cases rather than this attempted fictionalised version. And, truth be told, I didn't like ROOM very much at all. The premise is okay, but there are two problems with this. The first is the running time: at two hours, ROOM is a film which is dragged out. I couldn't help but think it would have worked better as a thirty minute short. I thought the first half was bad, but once the characters actually get out, it really stalls. I know they'll struggle to adapt to society, I can work that out for myself, but I didn't need to see all those dragged-out moments and relationships with other characters.",
156,11 September 2016,Leofwine_draca,4, Hateful characters,"Right from the first scene, Lenny Abrahamson shows us so much with a simple piece of information. Ma loses a tooth, making us realise she's not seen a dentist in years; Jack falls in love with a mouse because it's real, remaining us that he's likely never seen a living, breathing creature. We ache for Jack's lost innocence but also the same for his spiritually broken mother. When the two of them scream at each other, we feel the tragedy for both of them. Eventually, of course, Jack and Ma make it out of Room and Abrahamson does a terrific job at conveying Jack's terror at a world he doesn't understand. Shots from Jacob's POV are filtered, shaky and intrusive with extreme front-lighting, making us flinch back from the screen. The choice of music creates a sense of wonder but also a sense of sadness, and the inspired choice of casting the doctor to look exactly like their captor makes Jack's fear palpable. The whole film is cleverly from Tremblacy's point of view, replicating that spectator experience Jonathan Demme created in Rachel Getting Married. It is like you are there with Jack the whole time. The escape scene has the emotional resonance that Frank Darabont brought to The Shawshank Redemption, and even some of the small spats between Tremblay and Larson are reminiscent of Rian Johnson's Looper.",

177,25 December 2019,premedprincessxo,6, Started amazing..ended weak,". . . that is far easier to take allegorically than in any literal sense of story-telling. As a linear tale, ROOM is deeply flawed, building to its primary climax just 58 minutes into the 118-minute feature film, and then tacking on a pretty boring final hour (that mostly emptied my American theater by the end of the showing). However, when astute viewers realize that the main characters and locales in ROOM are standing in for other things, the flick as a whole is much easier to take. Perhaps if it was more directly titled (CANADIAN CONFESSIONS, for instance) more people in the world film market might ""get"" it. This movie is suggesting that most if not all Canadians feel trapped in a cold, squalid room or shed--sort of a back bay to the Real World tantalizingly close (but a world away) just South of their border. The ironically named Mom here, ""Joy,"" tries to convince son Jack that every wall has two sides, but Jack's not really buying it. Jack's kidnapper\rapist father, of course, is meant to represent Uncle Sam, that is, America. And Jack himself, certainly, stands in for the Canadian film industry, infamous for being comprised of a million counterfeit Americas--amazingly including ROOM itself (C'Mon, guys, don't tell us ROOM is in ""America,"" and then show a politically-incorrect ""Apache Burger"" joint just down the block in Etobicoke, Toronto, Ontario, Canada!). When Joy, with Jack's help, escapes ROOM (for the wider world of America, allegorically speaking), she has so much regret over what she's missed during the prime of her life the past seven years she attempts suicide. Only Jack (that is, the fraudulent Canadian film industry, the country's main export now that the XL Pipeline won't be spewing nation-killing tar sands oil to the rest of the planet) is able to cheer up Joy (at least, while in some sort of confined ROOM, such as a theater or shed).",

I honestly can not believe this movie was so engaging. The writer and director literally thought of everything. I think the reason why this film works as well as it does is purely because of the attention to detail. You feel everything the boy does when he sees and understands things for the first time. Another thing that the movie excels in is pacing. For the past 5 or more years it seems like most movies have had pacing problems. This one works well and never rushes or bores you to death.

This film really gives you a point of view from the other side of the story, it is not all about the thriller aspects of how 'Ma' (Brie Larson) has been held captive for years by a horrible man she refers to as 'Old Nick' who in retrospect is a kidnapper and an atrocious man. It looks at the characters sides of the story especially her son Jack who she has whilst captive in Room. He looks at life from a completely different view to his Ma and everybody else in the world that does not exist in Jack's mind. To Jack it is just him and his Ma, he sees no negativity in their situation which is truly beautiful.

There are a lot o movies which exploit much better this idea In the beginning of the movie there is not even a clue what is going on but i guess this is a movie trick used by the director.It's not about the fact that they have not escaped in those years. It's about the fact that the movie,after they escape shows a very little preoccupation for the true situation of the characters,of the inside fight. At least it is a better candidate for the Oscar prize, but it is not a movie which deserves a position in top 250 or to be nominated for Oscars. It is good when you put it besides the big short,spotlight,the revenant,bridge of spies, but come on... I hope Mad max will have a serious chance for winning the prize",

I imagine the book is much better than the film because the story picks up in this one at the end of 7 years of being stuck living in one room. While references are made in slight bits about how the ordeal for Ma and Jack started, there is very little done to explain how this could have happened for so long. Granted, that is not important to the dramatic part of this film, but it does make the film a leap that might explain why -Old Nick when he does lose Jack just takes off. I really thought he might do something more desperate like go back and harm Ma before the police free her from the room. ",
195,22 May 2016,DKosty123,7, Emotion Carries This Drama,"Please, please, please. Can you make room for about two minutes to read my review of the movie ""Room""? This movie is a haunting look at the emotional & survival aspects of child abduction seen through the eyes of a young boy. That boy's name is Jack; his mother Joy was abducted as a teen and held captive for numerous years. The despicable excuse for a human being who abducted Joy impregnated her and the result was Jack. The first half of the movie is captured in the shed ""room"" where Joy & Jack are held captive and it shows them both go through their normal daily routine, and their mother to child interactions. It is very disturbing to watch, but so resounding in how their resiliency holds them through. Jack is blinded to much of the world due to his captivity, and only envisions to be reality on what he sees on television; this is brilliantly presented by screenwriter Emma Donoghue who adapted the script from her novel. The second half of ""Room"" is stored in the aspects of adjusting to the real world after Joy & Jack are able to free their captor. Director Lenny Abrahamson helms the picture with a commanding orchestration of the inner emotional layers that Joy & Jack go through their experience in captivity and adjusting; my only minor critique of ""Room"" was in the film's unrealistic ending which obviously I won't reveal because there is no room for spoilers in my reviews. Brie Larson was astounding as Joy, and this is the real Joy who will be the next Oscar winner for Best Actress. Jacob Tremblay as Jack was a revelation, and this young actor is heading straight to the real world of stardom; he is a genuine pure talent. There was also strong supporting work from Joan Allen as Joy's mother, William H. Macy as Joy's father, and Tom McCamus as the boyfriend of Joy's mom. OK, I will free you now from this review, sorry I held you captive with all those roomy puns. Just make sure you make room for ""Room"". ***** Excellent",

198,4 September 2019,Koma-Mo,10, An amazing movie with so many things to appreciate.,"Adapted by Emma Donoghue from her own novel, this Fritzl-esque tale of brutal long-term abuse may come across as the easier, Hollywoodised alternative to Markus Schleinzer's Michael, but that description misses the point. Room goes beyond the horror of physical incarceration and explores arguably the more challenging issue of the psychological incarceration that follows. It's easy for cinema to show suffering; harder to portray recovery, especially the stuttering kind.",
199,13 January 2016,rooee,8, Reach for the sky,"Room was written in 2010 by Emma Donoghue and through close collaboration with director Lenny Abrahamson, who had written a letter and convinced her of his understanding of the novel and its characters, it was finally brought to the big screen in 2015. An immediate difference that the medium brings is the removal of the five year old first-person perspective of Jack who views 'Room' through his young, inexperienced lens. A novel's perspective can hide and obscure certain details depending on how and from where it is told - when Richard Adams' Watership Down was adapted into animation, it lost the nightmarish quality of encountering phenomena such as trains and cars through the rabbit's eyes, and in this film we also know from the start their predicament. But what is lost in perspective is supplemented through cinematic features, primarily in the cinematography by Danny Cohen. The first half of the film, comprised solely of scenes of life within the shed known as Room, are shot with long lenses, which thrust the camera up close and personal, compressing the space between foreground and background and visualising the claustrophobia of their existence. The shallow-focus brought about by the lens is particularly essential as the camera centres clearly on Jack and Joy, seeking to maintain the illusion of infinity that he has been raised to believe. An early crucial scene aligns the camera alongside Jack as he goes through his morning routine by greeting each inhabitant of Room, the frame bouncing from closeup to closeup of fingers brushing lamp, plant, TV and toilet. Cohen returns to the same routine in the final scene but now framed as a wide shot, and the imaginary space of Room is shrunken to a mere ten by ten shed. ",

Gone are the idiosyncrasies that made Frank wild and, for many including myself, compelling, instead we have a moving drama that earns its sentiment. The different approach is felt immediately as Abrahamson traps us with his two principle characters, Ma and Jack, in tight and sometimes oddly framed closeups. It's a somewhat clumsy execution to show the claustrophobia and intimacy Abrahamson wants to achieve as he uses Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's faces as blank canvases, but the effect is thoroughly felt, and the film's following 30 minutes remain its best. The photography decides to take a step back, but it continues to catch that raw emotion. ",

Just many scenes of getting back into the real life and mundane grievances. The narration by a boy who is far too old to be a 5 year old is about as irritating as it can get, but I can cut some slack with American child labor regulations. The story is rather flat, in dialogue, in relationships, in story line. Horrible what happened to victims like kampusch but that fact just isn't enough to make this particular one Oscar material.

It is a book that is so profoundly good that immediately when I was done I realized that even though the world is still the same everything feels different; I have changed. Narratives like this don't come very often for me. I love the book so much that I started and maintained a book thread in an internet forum (http://www.xtremeplace.com/yabbse/index.php? topic=99456.0). In prose, the harrowing subject matter is pushed to the background by using a very clever narrative device - the entire story is told from the perspective of a five- year-old child. We become privy to his thoughts, his emotions and his voice of innocence. I had my doubts whether this narrative stance could be replicated on film without losing its emotional impact. From the get-go I realized my fears are totally unfounded. Lenny Abrahamson has directed Emma Donoghue's adapted screenplay magnificently and it is buoyed by two stellar performances by Brie Larson and newcomer, Jacob Tremblay. ",

Basically twenty-four- year-old Joy ""Ma"" Newsome (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Brie Larson) and her five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live in a squalid shed they call ""Room"", sharing a bed, toilet, bathtub, television and a rudimentary kitchen, the only window is a skylight. A man called Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), Jack's father, abducted Joy seven years ago and has held her and Jack captive ever since, he routinely rapes her while Jack sleeps in the wardrobe, Joy is overcome sometimes with depression and suffers malnutrition, but tries to stay optimistic for her son. Having been in Room since he was born, Jack has been allowed by Joy to believe that everything he sees on television, from the rest of the world, is make believe, and that only Room and its contents are ""real"". This changes however when Old Nick tells Joy he has lost his job and threatens he may not be able to afford future supplies, so Joy decides to finally tell Jack the truth, there really is an outside world, everything on television is real, he reacts dramatically with disbelief and a lack of understanding. To stand a chance of getting out of Room, Joy trains Jack to fake a fever, hoping Old Nick will have no choice but to take him to hospital, but instead he says he return and bring antibiotics. Joy has Jack play dead so that she can wrap him in a carpet, in the hope that Old Nick will remove him from Room, he falls for this trick and places a wrapped up Jack in the back of his pickup truck, driving through a residential area, Jack is stunned by exposure to the outside world, but jumps from the truck and attracts the attention of a passer-by. Old Nick tries to take Jack back, but gets away before he can be questioned or caught, the police question a startled Jack about what has happened to him, he slowly explains about where he and his mother are being held, they soon identify the location of the shed and Joy is also rescued, they are both taken to a hospital. In the hospital Joy is reunited with her parents, father Robert (William H. Macy) and mother Nancy (Joan Allen), who she learns have divorced, Nancy is now married to new husband Leo (Tom McCamus), Jack is still overwhelmed by all the new things and people approaching him. Joy and Jack return to her childhood home where Nancy and Leo live, Robert cannot accept Jack and leaves, Jack initially struggles to adapt to life in the larger world outside of Room, speaking only to his mother about his feelings, even expressing a desire to return to Room. Joy struggles with anger and depression about the seven years taken from her and her son, she argues with her mother, and during a television interview about what happened reacts angrily, she finally has a breakdown and attempts suicide, but survives and is taken to hospital. With his mother recovering, Jack slowly shows signs of adapting and settling into his new life, bonding with his grandmother, Leo and his dog, playing with toys he has been given, and he meets and plays with a boy his age, he also finally allows his grandmother to cut his long hair, his ""strong"", so he can send it to his mother in hospital. Joy returns home and thanks Jack for saving his life again, he asks her if he can see Room again one last time, she agrees to his request and they visit room, escorted by a police officer, Jack feels that with the door open and light coming in that is has shrunk, Joy assures him it is the same place, Jack and Joy says his final goodbyes to Room, and they leave to continue life in the bigger world. Also starring Cas Anvar as Dr. Mittal, Matt Gordon as Doug, Amanda Brugel as Officer Parker and Joe Pingue as Officer Grabowski. Larson gives a compelling and career-minting performance as the emotionally drained mother who has had life stolen by a terrible situation and longs to escape, but this film almost completely belongs to newcomer Tremblay, who (with his long hair could be mistaken for a girl for a long while) is exceptional as the youngster whose whole life revolves around the small space he lives in until being gobsmacked by the realities of life in the bigger world, the mother-son bond is highly believable. The novel was inspired by the case of Josef Fritzl, the Austrian man who incarcerated his daughter in a basement for 24 years and systematically raped and impregnated her, but obviously the crime element is lessened. The incarceration and claustrophobia works fantastically for the dark first half, then when the break into the outside occurs it really delves into the complexities of the real world, this is absolutely from the point of view of the innocent child, nightmarish and emotional, but ultimately a thrilling, uplifting and well executed story, a must see drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay for Emma Donoghue, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Very good!",
222,28 January 2016,jboothmillard,8, Room,"""Room"" is certainly one of the most compelling and interesting drama movies of this year the plot and story is just so different and complex. The film is a harrowing tale of a young boy named Jack(beautiful work from Jacob Tremblay)who along with his Ma(Brie Larson)is trapped and confined for many years in an enclosed room with a 10-by-10-foot space to live in. Thru it all Ma coaches and cares for Jack along the way by reading him stories and singing him songs and putting him to bed with warm love and food. It just goes to show what it's like and how a person must make it when their life is a shelter away from the norm and society. Then all of a sudden the second half of the film takes a spin a twist as when the two escape an outside world is discovered by the little boy and mom. As the grandparents of Jack are found the loving yet tough accepting Nancy(Joan Allen)and Robert(William H. Macy). Most revealing and different is how little Jack sees an open world of sight and sound as it's an adjustment it's clearly not what he was use to with Ma. Overall this film proves that each and everyone leads their own little sheltered life in their own way and world. And true when one ventures out a new world of sight and sound and mind is discovered as each world and room for that matter is of different sight and it gives off a different feel for everyone. ""Room"" is one drama that sets free the character and viewer to discovery of new sight and to a new look of life.",

240,9 July 2016,pere-25366,9, A heartfelt and moving dramatic tale,"Room is a deeply psychological film about a mother, Joy, and her 5 year-old son, Jack, who grew up locked in a 10x10 shed, never seeing the outside world.
The first part of the movie walks us through their daily lives in the room, as well as some special situations, such as Jack's 5th birthday, arguments between Joy and Jack, and Joy's struggle to explain that there is more to the world than the room they live in.
The film excels at portraying the frustration that comes with trying to explain such concepts to a child who has only ever seen trees and animals on an old TV. Brie Larson's performance is outstanding.
Room climaxes with a successful escape plan in which Jack plays dead and fools Old Nick into taking him outside, where he manages to come in contact with a helpful man who calls the police. One of the officers patiently questions the child and finally frees Joy from the shed. The reunion scene between Joy and Jack is one of my favorites. The sheer relief on Joy's face as she realizes that they are finally free is priceless.
The story then continues with Joy trying to reintegrate in society and with Jack adjusting to an immense new world. This is a highly unusual situation, considering that most kids get to know the world as they grow up. It is hard for Jack to comprehend his environment, fact which makes him wish to return to the shed.
The film realistically portrays Joy's exhaustion and sadness about Jack's reactions but also never gives the impression that all hope is lost.

241,15 March 2020,casualist,10, Room - a beautiful movie,'Room' leaves a deep cutting impression and oh boy is it a tough one to review. It is a well made and expertly performed film. It also for better or worse tries to manipulate it's audience with dramatic triggers. I got mad at 'Room'. I felt it made some very predictably sensational choices in it's staging and in it's script.

254,9 April 2023,setorres-59664,10, A whole new world,"Of all the films coming out last year, I would definitely have to say that Room was one of my most anticipated releases and one of the films I was most looking forward to. Having now seen the film, I must say that it did not disappoint. I was mentioning in my review for Brooklyn about how we are getting a lot of really good female driven films that have great female performances and great perspectives from a woman's point of view and I would certainly add Room to that list as well. Room, is not based upon a true story, but the events in the film were most likely taken out of the newspaper headlines because we have had a lot of these cases surface and come to light within the past couple of years. The film does an excellent job of conveying what being trapped in a small space would have been like and while the film is quite disturbing at times and leaves you with an unsettled feeling it is also emotionally very powerful and also has moments of great beauty and humanity thrown into the film giving it a wonderful balance of both tragedy, loss and despair as well as hope and love and knowing that with time that everything will turn out okay. The two lead performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are amazing and two of the best performances of this past year, or really any year lately. Larson has proved what a talented actress she is with films like Short Term 12 and now Room will definitely be the film she will receive a much deserved Oscar for. I was really in disbelief though that Jacob Tremblay did not receive an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Jack. Here is a young kid who delivered one of the best child performances I think I have ever seen in a film and he proved himself totally capable of handling and delivering a performance in what is an emotionally really intense film and one that I think even people more than half, or triple his age would find difficulty in doing, but he makes his performance so natural and believable and we believe every second what he is thinking and going through and with his total fascination with the world and the things around him. This was a great oversight for the Academy by not nominating him because it was certainly one of the top performances of last year and worthy of an award. I am so glad that Brie Larson was nominated though and her performance is so great that I know she will be walking away with Oscar gold. Here is a character who goes through the unthinkable and yet while she still struggles during and after her circumstances, we see what a brave and independent woman this is and how for all the years in captivity she put her young son, Jack and his needs in front of her own and always looking after his best was just amazing and completely heart warming to watch. As others have said this film truly captures the deep and personal relationship between a mother and son and the endless love that goes with it. Larson's character is loving and caring for Jack, but we also see how she is strong and even later in the film while dealing with depression and trauma for what she went through we are completely with her every step of the way and again this is such a beautifully natural and realistic performance and one that must have been extremely emotionally draining and challenging to play each and every day, but Larson pulls it off flawlessly and is totally deserving of what is sure to be her first of many Oscars. The film would unfortunately maybe be too difficult for some to watch because of the heavy emotional content and the subject matter of the film, but I would challenge any serious film goers to give the film a chance anyways because it is such a wonderful cinematic experience and one that will surely move you and challenge you in many ways. Often throughout the film as I mentioned earlier, there is also scenes of love, family and maybe even in a sense coming to terms with yourself and the events of your life and these such moments did bring tears to my eyes and deeply moved me. This is a film where we certainly see that there are a lot of bad people in the world who do terrible things to one another, but the film does not let us lose hope because we are also confronted and experience the love between this mother and son and a relationship that does get challenged, but never broken and the strength that family and the right people in your life can have. This is not a film about despair, or the evils of mankind and yet while it does deal with that, this is overall a film about hope and overcoming your past and struggles and finding your peace in life even after a terrible trauma which is further helped by your loved ones. The film is certainly realistic and gritty at times, but all the more natural and real because of it and this is one of the most emotional and best cinematic experiences I have had of last year because we identify with these characters every step of the way and we feel hope and compassion for them and in many ways see that the outside world and things in it are truly beautiful and a wonder to behold and that personal growth and healing can happen to us all no matter what our circumstances.",

257,22 January 2016,Quietb-1,9, Room at the top,"I had this movie for a while on my watch list because it had a pretty good rating, but I never really got into watching it, as the plot sounded kinda boring to me. Anyhow one day I was bored and decided to give it a try. There is a lot of action going on that never gets explanation and you kinda keep on waiting and waiting for the answers to come up, but in the end, there isn't that much of a plot at all. I was expecting for there to be some really mind boggling plot twist, but all I really got was child throwing tantrum to his mother. If I wanted to see that, I would go to local stores toy isle. Questions unanswered are: Why did the guy kidnap the woman in the first place? What was the lawsuit about? Why was her father unable to watch the grandchild? How could it be, that the kidnapper hadn't never seen the child living in his shed for five years or why was he not allowed?
Not to mention holes in plot, like how the woman was completely used to modern world after seeing it for the first time in 7 years, nor did she even seem impressed by anything. Or, why would she not try to escape? There was a window made out of plastic in roof, she surely could have broken it in 7 years of time.
After they are out of the ""Room"", there really isn't that much to be seen in this movie. Nothing happens.",
258,4 January 2019,enokasperi,2, Don't be tricked by the high rating,"Toilet. Wardrobe. Bed. Bath. Chair One. Chair Two. I have deliberately left out pronouns because that is the way 5 year old Jack refers to the items in his tiny world, all he has ever known, a single room he occupies with his young mother who was snatched on her way home from school as a teenager 7 years ago and has been imprisoned in 'Room' ever since. 'Ma' has managed to bring Jack up in this bizarre environment in as healthy a way as she can, she has obviously taught him to read and write with the limited resources in 'Room', she makes a game of exercise, with Jack giggling and running from one end of 'Room' to the other. Her captor put a small TV in 'Room' at some point, and Jack sees all the things on it as a great fantasy. There is nothing outside of 'Room' to Jack. Jack and Ma make a birthday cake for Jack's 5th birthday, but he wonders why there are no candles on it. Every evening 'Old Nick', which is the name Ma and Jack have given her captor, visits 'Room' and rapes her. We see this through Jack's eyes from the slats of the wardrobe he sleeps in. This film is not afraid to ask a lot of its audience. Jack has temper tantrums and Ma has 'gone days' when she doesn't manage to get out of bed. On 'gone days' Jack entertains himself, just like on the outside world. There are short bursts of narration from Jack telling us what he understands of his existence. For reasons I would rather allow you to discover for yourself, Ma decides that it is time for quite risky attempts for her and Jack to escape from 'Room', so she starts to plant ideas in Jack's head about the outside world, she points out a leaf that falls on the skylight and Jack says 'but it's not green like on TV'. Ma hatches a plan for them to escape but crucial to her idea is Jack pretending to be ill. She coaches him on what he must do to convince Old Nick that he must go to a hospital. This first attempt at freedom fails, so she comes up with another plan. She coaches Jack again, and in a sequence of agonising suspense, Jack does get away. I'm giving nothing away telling you all this, because this is the point at which the film really spreads its wings (this much has been suggested in the trailers). The early scenes, although beautifully played, are merely set up for what follows. Ma's relationship with her own parents and a devoted family friend, Jack's discovery of everything outside of 'Room' and his growing fondness for his grandmother (the sublime and criminally underrated Joan Allen). Ma's father (William H Macy) cannot bring himself to look at Jack and we are not told why, which feels right. We don't need to be bashed over the head with what he is thinking. The questions raised are emotionally complex, staggering. What of the power of unconditional love a child has for it's mother? Ma questions her ability as a parent and Jack's response is simply 'But you're Ma'. How do we come to accept the point at which a child no longer completely depends on us as parents? Why do we find it so difficult to reconcile feelings of being trapped and tormented in our minds when we are physically free? It is so refreshing to see a film that doesn't make announcements about what it wants to say or signpost it's big moments. They just happen. I am loathe to point out any particular scene in a film which unfolds so fluidly but there are two, you will know them when they come, where I dare you, DARE YOU, not to be an emotional wreck. I am normally pretty good at keeping myself together when I go to the cinema, but when the credits rolled here I had to rush to a toilet to compose myself before I left the building. The great film critic Roger Ebert once said 'It's not what a movie is about, it's how it is about it'. This film's director, Lenny Abrahamson, understands this completely. I could describe every single scene and divulge every plot detail and I truly believe doing so would not make seeing it any less meaningful. The film is that good. The balance of subtlety and poignancy is perfect. The music is incidental and subtle, the camera angles, particularly in the early cramped scenes, are largely from Jack's point of view, to great effect. This film even goes to the trouble of managing the viewer's suspension of disbelief by paying heed to the fact that Jack would not have been exposed to normal bacteria having been holed up in a small room for so long.",

(2) You are born into a captivity in which you know hardly anything about what most people take for granted as ""the world"" and then are suddenly thrust into that world with almost no understanding of what you're seeing, what to do or how to behave. Stop. Think about it. Either situation would be a horribly upsetting and disorienting to experience. We see both situations play out in the fictional drama ""Room"" (R, 1:58). Although the film is not based on any specific real-life story, it does have a strong basis in reality – in the cases that we occasionally see on the news or in a true-crime TV drama. A young woman is taken captive by a monstrous person who holds her for years against her will. In some cases, innocent children are born into such situations, knowing nothing but confinement, with only a mother's love to depend on.",

You might think their lives would be better if they simply went outside sometimes, but soon the premise is established: they can't, because they are being kept as prisoners, and the child has lived their entire life in one room. It's loosely based on true (and horrific stories); but 'Room' is a decidely middlebrow treatment. The escape, when it comes, is thrilling, but the mother's psychology (to try an unlikely trick after years of passive acceptance) makes no sense to me, and what happens next is somehow very predictable: the grandparent (an utterly typcast William Macy) who can't emotionally connect, the blame-casting journalist, the mother's suicide attempt and the child's folksy wisdom formed after discovering the world.

In addition, due to not really getting what situation these characters were in, made it really underwhelming when they made their rather fortunate escape; there was no feeling of awe at this, seemingly, new and strange environment (like in Oldboy, The Hurt Locker,and The Descent), and it's clear with the slow-mo, and shots of Jack's (Jacob Tremblay) face that was what they were attempting.",

276,26 January 2016,oOoBarracuda,9, Make Space for Room!,"Jacob Tremblay is really good in this curious, and slightly claustrophobic, tale of a young lad ""Jack"" who lives with his doting ""Ma"" (Brie Larson). Nothing odd about that, you might think - well, except for the fact that thus far in his short life, ""Jack"" has never actually left the room in which he lives. He eats there, plays there, sleeps there - he knows nowhere else. As he ages though, he begins to get itchy feet and his mother finds it more and more difficult to contain his enthusiasm for finding out what is going on outside. What also emerges from their scenario is that ""Ma"" herself is not exactly free to move about. She was taken by ""Nick"" (Sean Bridgers) many years earlier and it soon becomes clear that he is likely the father of the boy she is so desperate to protect. Are they better off indoors or seeking freedom? Well, she decides that the latter offers them a better chance of happiness (and quite possibly sanity, too) - but the execution of that plan is not without risk! Lenny Abrahamson directs this with quite a bit of subtlety. He allows the audience to become immersed in the relationship between the two principals; he lets them do the talking and as the narrative unravels we realise that the story is anything but what we may have expected at the start. There is a palpable chemistry between the confident Tremblay and his more experienced co-star, and she complements that well. This is a nuanced and engaging tale offering us plenty of parallels of modern life - good and bad; with a dialogue that is both poignant and frequently heartfelt too. Certainly, it was nothing at all like I was expecting and it's stimulating and enjoyable in equal measure. Well worth a watch.",

The main themes of this movie being humanity and motherhood. I've never seen such a brilliant portrayal of the human condition before. Brie larsons's character is trying to care for her son with little resources and in a horrible situation. She raises him as best she can in the situation provided. It isn't often that a rich Hollywood actor or actress can really encapsulate what it's like to be that desperate or that caring, but Brie Larson absolutely kills it. She is so human In her portrayal. I was honestly surprised she isn't a parent now because she really encapsulates what it's like. She definitely deserved that Oscar. The kid who plays jack was very good as well, as he convincingly portrayed someone with no knowledge of the outside world. This movie is subtle and there's are no real action shots or adrenaline rushes besides the escape scene in the middle, but it's such a rewarding experience.

Brie Larson and lil Jacob - applauds! don't know how to describe my thoughts and feelings about their acting,it was really touching,Brie is expressing the whole drama, exactly what we need to see,her eyes her face clearly says the past and condition of present. i really couldn't imagine how lil boy would manage to run when he didn't even know about world outside the room and i thought that it would be some kind of unreal and untrue scene, but then it surprised me! soundtrack is nice and calm, i also liked decoration of room and lifestyle of Jackie and Ma in one Room! To be honest the screenplay seems like unreal,7 years in room, childbirth in room,no escape before,no information about old Nick and there many things we can ask questions about, But! the cast,director and whole crew made it REAL LIFE TOUCHING DRAMA! and it was getting real and real time by time. i also thought that life after escaping would make me angry but nah! it surprised me again! the integrate to new world for 7 yrs old boy who didn't know anything about it - and the integrate for Ma to 'old world' was exactly how it supposed to be with few illness and whole stuff!",
284,18 March 2016,MrUNHAPPY,9, Movie Of the Year Surely!!,"I enjoyed the beginning and its a simple story about a son and a woman trapped in a room . At the start , we didnt know that they were trapped but we understand that much later when we see the other man . That was pretty interesting to know how they will get out of there after 7 years . And after that , the movie have a bored long sequence of sentimentalism and a mom's decisions about his son and her . Pretty good anyway but the second part is really meaningless and make me want to sleep really . The only interesting part in the second part is the moment where they go back again in the room and see another perception of the kid . I enjoyed also the narration from the kid and his perspective all along the movie and give another perspective even if he is only a child. Nice movie anyway but the second part can be erased really . I didnt see the purpose of it : Maybe only to see the life after the Room ? How to raise a child after that incident ? I didnt really get it but whatever . Go see it anyway.",

291,7 January 2022,gianmarcoronconi,9, Very nice,"Sometimes a person's world can be as small as a stifling room. Specifically, when a 17-year-old girl is kidnapped by a man who uses her as his sex slave, having abducted her sever years earlier producing her child. Surprisingly the movie is now 125th ranked IMDb movie of all times,but bewildered movie's director, Lenny Abrahamson, should have realised some troubles in this 118 minutes. Firstly, we all thought the boy was a girl. Is it so difficult to cut his hair a little bit? So, we are expecting Ma to have lied about his gender so that he would not be a rape target. But not – towards the end you realize it is a boy. Why were we so distracted by that for absolutely no reason? Then the director had created 50 intriguing first minutes provoking questions like: 'are they going to die enclosed?' or 'will they somehow try to escape?' whereas in the second half he fabricated a clumsy and infinitely one-dimensional and boring drama. There is just no real connection between the first and the second act. The seven years Ma previously spent in the room might as well have been a written premise at the start of the movie. But with no deeper layers to the film and with no character really fleshed out, the picture feels aimless. Maybe the first part of the movie was that brilliant that the second half does not live up to it. Unfortunately, the Irish filmmaker did not find harmony like he previously did in Frank (2014) and What Richard Did (2012). If the movie had finished just before they have escaped from the garden shed that would have been great. He should have probably said to himself: ""As the movie is so-called 'Room', I must focus more on what happens inside the room and go with the flow with all the rest of it"". Nice effort 'my friend' but this does not work like this, mainly because this is a potential Oscar winning movie and what you have done is just not even enough to be nominated for the Oscar awards. With such a bloodcurdling topic, a seven year prisoner who has been abducted and her little child discovering for the first time the existence of a brand new world outside a room where he was born, the story struggles to hold our interest as the outside world intervenes. The issue as cinema-goers is that we have simply expected to find the cherry on the pie – to see something unexpected and pleasurable, and what Abrahamson does to all cinemaddicts is living them starving because nothing interesting happens at all. Put simply, we know how this part of the story goes – they both are stressed, later they come down and eventually adapt to the house rules. That is really sad and the worst thing is that with a sort of plot like this, the movie has got a score of 8.3 out of 10 on IMDb! How come this movie is better than The Truman show (1998), A beautiful mind (2001) or Gran Torino (2008)? You should open your eyes and ears people and do not rate movies so generously next time. This is definitely one of those movies that the IMDb rating makes you imagine some sort of Life is Beautiful unfolding in a room. In here all is about an annoying kid and his annoyed mom stuck in a room. They both manage to escape the room and guess what? They continue to be annoying and annoyed. The characters are so completely one dimensional that the movie fails to both entertain or be insightful. You end up feeling stuck with the characters in this two hour long ordeal. Like someone dragging a fingernail on a chalkboard.",

293,14 January 2016,caseynicholson,8," Try to Watch This Film ""Cold""","A young woman is held captive in a suburban garden shed for seven years, repeatedly raped and without access to the outside world. She and her son plot their escape from the monster who has imprisoned them in ""Room,"" an intensely felt cinematic experience. ""Room"" is an emotionally sumptuous drama based on Irish-Canadian author Emma Donoghue's award-winning 2010 novel. It is not just a tale of terror or survival, but a celebration of the impenetrable bond between a parent and a child. ""Room"" won the People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival due to its delicately rendered and relatable core relationship, making it a worthy awards season contender. The first two-thirds of ""Room"" rely on a believable connection between Ma and Jack, played by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Director Lenny Abrahamson (working from an adapted script by Donoghue) could not ask for a better pairing than Larson and Tremblay, who find new ways to astonish with their raw honesty. ""Room"" is an intimate film that raises important questions about what defines us as people, why we are resilient under duress, how contentment persists, and what a parent does when their child outgrows their need for them. We are left with a mother and child who are able to close the door on the past and look forward to the future. Lenny Abrahamson has become a renowned film-maker, from the Beckettian tragicomedy of Adam & Paul to the musical madness of Frank. His latest film, adapted by Emma Donoghue from her own novel, is an unexpectedly life-affirming parable of parenthood wrapped in the clothing of a modern-day horror story. The most important details in this text are the performances of Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay as the central couple in ""Room"". Abrahamson has the intelligence to trust his cast to show us the world through their eyes, and what a world it is. This house has many mansions, and in its labyrinthine corridors strange new worlds collide. Steven Spielberg's AI is another mother-son tale that similarly channels the ""real boy"" themes of Pinocchio. It is a heartbreaking tale of the power of motherly love and of a nurtured child's ability to find light in the dark woods of the adult world. Room opens with the sound of breathing, expressionist images of a scratched wall, a sink, a skylight and the whispered words: ""Go back to sleep."" This is the 10ft x 10ft sealed enclosure in which five-year-old Jack lives with his Ma, a young woman who was abducted seven years ago. Danny Cohen's superb cinematography makes the world seem as large to Jack as it does to Ma, from the ocean of the lavatory cistern to the caves under the bed where the eggshell snake lives and the wardrobe in which Jack sleeps. Room is neither a horror movie nor a film about crime and/or captivity. It focuses on how the human spirit may transcend physical boundaries, and the disparity between external and internal freedom. Stephen Rennicks's score emphasises the gentle domesticity of Jack and Ma's circumstances, later giving way to ambient chimes that lend an unearthly edge to our own alien world.",

In the confines of a small room and space a great story of struggle, sacrifice and sadness is conveyed. The film is effective in getting the viewer to formulate numerous thoughts as to why a young mother and her son exist in this small room. We gradually wonder until a shocking and unspeakable truth is revealed to us. After this revelation a number of things makes sense. Like little Jack is slowly coming to terms with reality it gradually sets in for the audience. Lenny Abrahamson cleverly keeps his audience within the confines of that room until he reveals its cruel reality.

310,29 January 2016,stephendaxter,9," Beautiful, Emotional, Intense, and Dramatic. A Truly Gripping Story","Have you ever watched a film and thought ""I've seen this before"". The same old plot rehashed, good vs evil, victim vs oppressor, with the good oh so perfect and the evil eventually getting their cummuppence at the end of the film?
If that's what you want, don't watch this film. If you want all action scenes, if you want in depth character analysis, a view into the psyche of a kidnapper, a morality lecture, a commentry of the state of society, the trauma of rape, or just like seeing the bad guy eventually getting killed after the mandatory end of film fight when he rises from the apparent dead before eventually being finished off, but not before some trite final exchange between the hero and villan, then don't watch this film. You'll be disappointed. If that's what you want, there are 1000s of other films you can watch.
This film tells the story entirely from the point of view of a 5 year old child. Elements of the story that don't involve the child aren't shown. Issues with the characters that don't affect the child aren't shown, and those that do affect him are only shown in that context. No attempt to explain or analyse why the adults are behaving in the way they do. Lots of unanswered questions that an adult would ask, such as about possible methods of escape, which are not dealt with. Because the film is not from the POV of an adult. That's what most of the critics of this film simply didn't get.
It also doesn't follow the usual flow of a film. It doesn't build to a climax at the end, the climax is in the middle.
Whether you like or hate this film, at least you won't have seen it before, or most likely anything like it.

The Irishman Lenny Abrahamson directed this hard and claustrophobic film. The first impression of Room is that the film is rather comfortable. Ma and Jack enjoy each others company and do things that a mother and son usually does. They bake, eat food, celebrate birthdays and watch TV together.

But she shows courage and a strong will to survive. There is so much emotional depth to her character. She shows love for her son, uses her survival instincts and a real strength has a human being to want to live in the real world again. The performance is astonishing and the performance by Jacob Tremblay as the young son is equally powerful. If you love great movies and performances, and can take this subject matter you must see this movie. Brie Larson better prepare a speech at the Oscar's because this the most sure front runner I've seen in a long time.",

This movie takes place in a town where, apparently, electricity and the electric light have not yet been discovered and are unknown. Worse yet, the cinematographer, director, editors, etc.etc. seem to be from this same town. Where the scenes are not black, they are so dark one cannot see anything. I wonder again why they bother with set designers, costumers, makeup or anything similar (things listed in the credits) when they can't be bothered to show any of it to the audience. I get the concept of darkness in the shed, but why the darkness anywhere else. One can show confinement and oppression yet allow the audience to see what is going on. Of course that's theory on my part. Maybe the producers and directors were so low budget they were embarrassed by sets and costumes and ""painted it black"" to hide them. The script is ok I guess, but this is supposed to be a movie, a visual art. If you can't see a visual art there is no point to it. There is no point to this.",

The biggest exception was that I thought Jack's rapid, rather smooth transition socially to being around other people and losing the familiarity of the items in Room was unrealistic.

375,2 June 2022,jaysanchu07,8, Deeply Moving Story on Freedom and Unbreakable Bonds,"An irritable woman, a little ""girl"" with very long hair, a messy room, just some food that can only be eaten. Opening a movie without reading the introduction, to be honest, I have a lot of prejudices. At that time I wondered why she didn't take her children out, why did she have to rely on that man to have food, is it not good for self-reliance? Look, without knowing it, I arbitrarily assert.
Fortunately, curiosity suppressed my irritability, wondering when she would take the child out, when she could live on her own, and continue to watch the movie with my prejudices. When I really saw the iron gate and the little skylight, I woke up. It's not that she didn't want to go out, but that she fell into real hell. The life in captivity forced her to only dream with her children. For seven years, I could not imagine how she persevered. She used her efforts to create a normal childhood for her children, using necklaces made of eggshells and patterns made of cardboard to let children read and watch TV. Finally determined to let the child understand the truth, because the child could not accept them for a while, they had a strong dispute and had a cold war for a while. Pretending to be sick, pretending to die, and constantly training, the child finally had the opportunity to be taken out of the wooden shed as a ""corpse"".
Mother kept telling the child to crawl out of the rolled blanket and jump out of the car after the car stopped. When he met the first person, he asked for help. Before the age of 5, he had never seen a third person, thinking that those on TV were fake, and everything in nature was fake, because his pet dog was also fake. When his mother tells him the truth of this world, he needs to identify the true and false of people and animated people. They were finally reborn and saved. A 17-year-old girl was imprisoned for seven years. Is such a person worthy of being called a person? In a straightforward manner, the evil in this world goes far beyond this. And the movie did not end after they were saved. Life is not the perfect ending, so it can end. In seven years, everything outside requires her to accept and adapt again. Everything around will not stop because of her disappearance, time will not stop because of her disappearance. Holding a photo album to see friends at that time, their lives are still the same, this is the biggest blow to her. I can't understand that when they were interviewed, the host repeatedly forced her to recall the past, and still questioning why she didn't release her child for freedom earlier. I have a hard time understanding how it is a fault to depend on each other to survive. In that situation, all her methods are not wrong. This is not measured by right or wrong, no one can truly empathize. The fact that the authorities are obsessed with bystanders is not just a warning to those in it. Isn't there a warning to be onlookers? It is wrong that your sobriety does not mean that the person who is truly experienced. What we lack is not only empathy, but also a sobriety of being self-righteous.
Fortunately, they finally said goodbye to the room and really came out. Maybe this shadow is difficult to erase in this life, maybe in many midnight dreams, waking up in a trance. Fortunately, they were finally saved. I thought it was just my mother who said that he was a boy in order to protect the child. As a result, he was a real boy, a brave man.
The disparity in strength has made women, children and the elderly naturally belong to the disadvantaged groups. How to protect themselves has actually been talked about a lot, but there is little education for the truly powerful. I hope that each mother can do her best to cultivate a real man, not a murderer with a decent appearance.",

A young woman is abducted and then forced to live in a shed. The shed is soundproof and locked. Her assailant then gets her pregnant and she has the baby. The story begins after the child is now about 5 years old. The mother and son live in this one room shed. The kidnapper only shows up when he wants his way with the mother or brings food and supplies. They are given just the bare minimum to survive. When the abductor starts to see the child as a possible new direction for the abuse, she knows it is time to get the child out before it is too late. The script is well written. I believed every minute of what was going on and how it played out. I hope not to give too much away, but getting out of the ""Room"" is only half the movie.

The mother finally out, rather than get her and her free'd child on a plane out of there for a ocean vacation instead tries to top herself, again it's the boy left strong.

Either way this childs rollercoaster of emotions are incredible acting for a child so young and on such a deep topic you wouldnt think a child that age could grasp. It did get drawn out in places, ot couldve gone into a horror where the baddy goes for revenge but dodnt and I'm fine with that. A film to make you appreciate what you have even if it's only little.

Her inability to convey any emotion on her face was misconstrued as good acting; because being held captive for years doesn't call for a wide range of emotions. The Cinemagic that made this 2-hour movie seemed 6 hours long was amazing. I can't even phantom how they did that. All these 9 and 10 reviews is people feel obligated to give it to review the cost of the Academy Awards. They are lying to you. They are so many things left unexplored which is a shame. . . No wait, isn't or this movie would have been a month long. I get this is supposed to be some heartfelt and emotional movie to move you to tears for some cathartic moment but the sappy music that plays at every vaguely emotional scene ruins.

It has a dramatic genre at first, but secondly it becomes a thriller movie.
Joy (called by her son ""Ma"") and her five-year-old son Jack live in a shed that they call ""Room"" where have a bed, a toilet, a bathtub, a television, and a kitchen...but with only one window. They are captives of a man who is called Old Nick (Jack's father) .He abducted Joy seven years ago, and normally rapes her while Jack is hidden in the wardrobe. Jack believes that only Room and what in it are ""real,"" and the rest of the world exists only in television.
When Joy discovers that Old Nick lost his job, she's afraid he'll abandon the house, letting them die without food or water. She thinks about a plan to escape: Jack will pretend to be dead and get rolled up in Rug so Old Nick will bury Jack far from the house. In this case ,Jack can escape when Old Nick stops at a stop sign.
Jack's innocence and sweetness, Joy's strong hope to get out of ""Room"" and continue living the life that Old Nick has stolen from her, make this movie painful to watch; especially thanks to actors' excellent skills in acting.",

406,21 November 2019,thedarkhorizon,6," Brilliant, but very uncomfortable. See life in the perspective of a 5 year old boy.","Room is directed by Lenny Abrahamson and stars Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Joan Allen, Sean Bridgers, and William H. Macy. The film is about a woman named Joy ""Ma"" Newsome who was abducted and held captive in a room for seven years, and her son, Jack who is five years old and has been living inside that particular room his entire life. The film follows their attempt at escaping from that place and as we see through Jack's eyes, his experience of the outside world for the first time in his life. This is definitely at the top of my best movies of the year, simply because it is incredibly done and perfectly portrayed. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay give some of the best performances I've ever seen in my life in any movie what so ever. The kid, Jacob, is phenomenal and surprisingly he carries it all throughout. You'd think that an amazing actress like Brie, and her character would be the center of the movie but that's actually not the case. As she says so in the movie, her kid saves her many times, and that goes to show just how different and amazingly done this movie really is. The director (Lenny Abrahamson) also did a very good job here, as he kept us interested and entertained through the first part of the movie when they're in the room. That is really hard to do, considering that there are not much things to do or a lot of different ways to go about it but this director did it. The music composed by Stephen Rennicks is very touching and gives those very much needed and present emotional moments meaning and heart. I think that one of the main reasons as to why this movie worked so wonderfully well was the screenplay written by the author of the original book that this movie is based upon, Emma Donoghue. More movies should take notice of this and be loyal to the main source because that's the best way to succeed at making an adaptation. I pretty much loved everything about this movie, it was touching, filled with incredible performances, very good cinematography, great directing that conclude to the perfectness that this movie is.",

418,29 September 2016,RobTortureWright,9, Dark and Sinister but Truly Outstanding.,"I absolutely loved this film and the way this tragic but at the same time sweet and hopeful story was told, which is mainly through the eyes and observations of this 5 year old boy Jack, whose view of the world completely changes when he is forced to come to grips with the fact that the world is a much bigger place than what he's known through living in the room. Jack and his mom share a relationship like no other, and it is rare that you see such a strong bond between two people portrayed in such an authentic and delicate way, by two incredible actors Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. These two provide the backbone of the story, their strength, their perseverance and the love they share is what makes the film-goers become so attached to these characters. The details that were put in this story make it so much more than just a story about 2 victims of a psychotic kidnapper that faced immense psychological trauma. For example, the way that Joy uses Alice in wonderland's story to explain to Jack what happened to her and why they were in room, or her facial expression as she looks up at the ceiling and wonders what will be the future of her child if she doesn't do anything to get him out of there. Joy's blank expression as she ponders the journalist's words of whether it would have been better to have asked Old Nick to get him out, shows a tormented soul that is struck with the realisation that she has potentially been a bad mother to the one thing she loves the most and has devoted her life to. The miracle of the story is that little Jack, as afraid and bewildered as he first is by this new world he is forced to enter, becomes the hero of the story and gives his mom his hair, in a way lending her his 'strong' to help her get through her depression. I've been a bad mother to you, Joy tells him and he replies with: You're Ma, ultimately the most important words that a mother could hear. An incredibly touching story involving two superb performances that I know I will be coming back to forever.",

426,23 January 2016,Equalizer16,9, Discover the world in the beautiful emotional story of Room.,"The Good:
First half is exceptional, no doubt about it. The mistery about the room is kept just right, the mother-son relationship feels real and yet it´s all covered with a lovely sense of fantasy. Most of all there are a couple of scenes of almost unbearable beauty that capture successfully all the ashtonishment the mere existence of this world can bring to any of us. The film´s concept is necessary for these to work, and they do indeed, in what can potentially be a powerful and beautiful eye-opening experience.
I´m generally against voice-overs but the kid´s narrations are wonderful. One of them specifically is brilliant as a joyful tearjerker.
The Bad:
The second half isn´t remotely as confident as the first one. That´s a pity because the point is very interesting and had the potential to become a seriously outstanding film.
Focusing on the boy is a great way to manage such a complicated emotion as the adaptation to the real world and the film should probably have gone all the way with that idea. We don´t really see the world through his eyes as much as it is intended to because we´re stepping out of him too often. The childish amazement loses most of the presence for quite a while. We´re left with small bits of information about other characters while the boy´s transition loses detail.
The Ugly:
This is the kind of film that inspires reactionary ratings. We´ll see how it holds up with time. Some people might want to put it down because most people will overlook its flaws in favor of the torrent of emotions it produces at its best moments.",

They are both living, surviving, trapped in a 10 by 10 foot space that Ma has called Room in her best efforts to protect Jack from the absolutely unthinkable nightmare that is the only life he has ever known, a life she isn't sure will ever be anything else. However, miraculously, through Ma's ingenuity and guts and Jack's courage, one day, they escape. With their 10 x 10 Room behind them, they face a new world (literally) of hopes, possibilities, challenges and fears. I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch Room or Spotlight next with the Oscars upon us, but a good friend of mine, Steve Williams, strongly recommended Room. I'll be watching Spotlight next, but thank you to Steve for the recommendation. It was powerful. Larson has had supporting roles in Trainwreck, The Gambler and Don Jon along with multiple TV appearances, but this is her first leading role and she also looks right at home. In fact, her performance has not only earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, but many critics are predicting she will go home with the win and after watching the movie, it would be an award well-deserved. Room opens on Jack's 5th birthday. We find out later that Ma was abducted 7 years earlier and Jack was born and raised in Room. Her abductor makes regular visits (conjugal in nature) with Jack tucked away in Wardrobe. We already know from the preview that they do eventually escape and are given a chance to have a life outside Room, so that's not a spoiler there. I won't give it all away, but the escape will leave you breathless with white knuckles as you cling to whatever you have nearby. I really only had two minor issues with the movie. First, after she is reunited with her parents, Ma is unsettled to discover they had split and her mother (Joan Allen) had met a new man. Her father (William H. Macy) flies home to be there for the reunion, but quickly leaves and can't even look at Jack or address him. And then we don't see him again and are left wondering what happened. ",

It didn't need to be ultra-explicit visually, but 'Room' was presented more like a hankies-at-the-ready emo weepfest than a genuinely harrowing study in cruelty and repression. As for the 2nd half of the movie, the attempts at scenes of angsty/shouty family drama and turmoil were from the straight-to-DVD standard school of acting. All in all a bland, boring and forgettable excercise in hollywood 'realism'.",

My heart was beating so fast when the boy was in the back of Old Nick's truck. I was literally at the edge of my feet. It also brought tears to my eyes when Grandma tells Ma that she wasn't the only one whose life was destroyed. I felt that. Because as a mom, as horrible as it sounds, you'd much rather know your child has passed rather than know that they're probably still out there being tortured, beaten, raped, sold, etc. and you don't know where. I can only imagine how antagonizing that must be. How do you find closure never knowing what happened to your child? This movie is really good. I like how Jack narrates the story because it shows how a little boy his age makes sense of things, how he gathers up what he knows and build his logic based upon that. He's so innocent, yet so smart. I love how his character develops from being a secluded boy to being out in the big world.",

463,14 April 2020,GailTaplin-98447,10, Cannot believe I had not even KNOWN of this film....BRILLIANT!!!!!,"I watched this film not expecting to like it. I am drawn to a different type of film. To say that I was blown away by this film is an understatement. This film is almost indescribable it's so good. This is the kind of film we get when everyone involved is at the top of their game. You can't just credit director Lenny Abrahamson, or screenwriter Emma Donoghue, or stars Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, or composer Stephen Rennicks solely. This was a team effort. Brie Larson gives the bets acting performance of this decade as Joy/Ma, a mother lost at sea, metaphorically speaking. Jacob Tremblay gives a performance way beyond his years. The Academy made a serious mistake not nominating him for an award. Joan Allen, in what little screen time she has, gives one of, if not the most unappreciated performance of the year. Lenny Abrahmson has been quietly going about his business in Ireland. He certainly shocked most people with this film. His talent is undeniable and the Academy Award nomination was just the reward he warranted. Emma Donoghue's novel and script are both outstanding, and I believe that The Big Short was lucky to win the Adapted Screenplay award. Stephen Rennicks is a complete unknown in the world of film composing. I feel this may change. His work on this film is a revelation. The moment in this film where all the people named above are at their best is when Ma runs to the police car in which Jack is waiting. The slow-motion running is astounding. The music is extremely moving. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are as good as they were for the rest of the film. I don't know why I waited so long to see this film. I regret waiting to watch it and to anyone out there who wants to see the best film of 2015, or the decade, I urge you to stop reading this and go watch it. You will be better for it.",

The directing was also brilliant. Emotions and drama are well established in the film. My only problem with the video is how the boy escaped from the room, which was performed in a frenzy.

His mother (Brie Larson) has raised him with the belief that the room they live in is the entire world. She does so to protect him from the fact that they are prisoners, held captive by a man who uses her as a sex slave. Dealing with subject matter that could easily tip over either to unbearable bleakness or cliché melodrama, director Lenny Abrahamson, writer Emma Donoghue and the two excellent actors do an incredible job at creating a film that feels both honest and empathetic. A number of intelligent decisions in presenting the material are made, including telling the story from Jack's perspective, not making the captor a 'movie villain' and choosing to deal with the fallout of the climax, which occurs in the middle of the film.

I was particularly disappointed by the characterisation of 'Old Nick' (mid-cast, I feel, and we see little of his confused and confusing state of mind. Jack's relationship with the objects in the house is skimmed over and the conflicts of the grandparents were simply alluded to rather than properly explored.

This is the first film from Lenny Abrahamson (who previously directed Frank in 2014) that I've seen, an honestly I now have an urge to watch the rest of his films; the directing is a major way this film works - Abrahamson blends together an incredible mix of Ma's lament for life and also her extreme happiness for Jack very well, and constantly makes the film go from superbly tense to emotional highs in split instants. There was some very good work from Emma Donoghue (who also wrote the novel) on the script, which was beautifully and delicately written, and in my opinion never had a false note. This film, unlike most, is split into two acts instead of three, both of which last for around 55 minutes. The structure is very tight, and very event seemed very carefully placed and vital to the overall story. This is an incredibly depressing film, which doesn't let go of you for a moment, nor does it ever cease with its emotional highs. The imprisonment of Ma and the general story are very carefully handled. ",

I was disappointed by the performance of Brie Larson. She just didn't provide the flesh Ma had in the book, justice was not paid to the character. There were moments where it felt like Larson was reading from a blurry teleprompter. Ma was tragic without being weak. Larson was not able to provide that feeling. The supporting cast were outstanding enough to carry the slack. I was gobsmacked when she (Larson) won the Oscar. This performance is proof that money can buy you a statuette.

The child is a boy, though his distracting long hair and feminine features suggest otherwise, and the room is his entire world. Room depicts his perspective as his world changes. Although the movie works on an emotional level without feeling too manipulative, I disliked the scenario and was bothered by the questions it raised. How believable is the main characters' captivity, the extent of their trauma, and their attempts to escape it? I have my doubts, but I think the audience is supposed to be too in awe of their maternal bond to care. I, however, wanted a little more intelligence from the tantrum-prone duo. The mother is saved by a five-year-old with a facile understanding of his environment. Ignorance is bliss, I suppose, but let's not pretend it's lovely or enlightening. One could argue the mother protects her son's purity, but even this seems a matter of luck given her limited control over the situation. I guess I can't abandon my intellect to appreciate a child's innocence, especially when it could have been more effectively preserved by a little adult cleverness.",

I too, like others, depend on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes for guidance on movies to watch. In a sea of crappy art films and overdone remakes of old classics. Today's ease of filming anything makes viewing films these days a chore. Maybe that's why all the oldies are rated so high. I saw the rating for ""Room"" and thought it was worth a go. Sometime during viewing, I glance back at IMDb to get another view of opinions or plots. Although the first ones are usually on par, others tend to have an opposite opinion which their entitled to have. I had to write something on this film because of some of the opinions expressed about their views on the story. It's one thing to have an opposite opinion of someone but, I think it's an injustice to categorize a movies has a ""Housewives"" story or ""Lifetime"" quality. This film is waaay beyond that! And I'm a Man in my mid 30's. Movies are our gifts to escape ourselves and take a break to immerse ourselves in someone elses shoes and see things through the eyes of the characters. This story is about an abducted girl who was abducted, raped, and locked in a shed. Her child, only knew for his 5 yrs. of existence what happened in Room. Our job as a viewer is to put ourselves in Jack's place and realize a world he thought was only on television. To cast this experience aside is to belittle our human emotions. I personally felt for both the main characters. To try to comprehend what they are going through,.......this film does better than average to try to begin to convey what it would be like. To try to feel their situation. That's what makes this film so good! I wonder about the world I'm trying to raise my children in knowing how easy it is for some to dismiss our humanity. To care about people, even for just a few moments before going back to reality. This film IS NOT just for housewives and women folk! This is for any human who feels. Who understands what emotions are and how to feel them. Don't let anyone sway you from watching this!! It's a reminder of a sick world and how to come back from the dark into the light",

I'm too used to the usual tripe version: too much dwelling on the sick nature of what happened in gory details to shock the viewer rather than focusing on the characters, and usually the movie ends the second they escape, off to an instant happy ending. This movie is refreshingly different and focuses on the personal experiences of the boy in particular and his mother, with almost half the movie dedicated to what happens after the escape. Because of this it's very effective at making you feel for the characters and connect with each rise and fall. Not an instant happy ever after that people swaddle themselves with, but a true raw connection with the human difficulties and consequences of a horrible ordeal. It's celebrating how people adapt and dust themselves off that is inspiring, not a whitewashed instant gratification. Well worth the watch, best movie I've seen in some time.",

Such a sad and emotional story, Larson connects so well with the emotions of a person in such a terrible scenario allowing the audience to go there with her. With the help of her small but incredibly talented co-star, Jacob Tremblay, Larson gives the performance of a life time. The relationship between the two of mother and son was one of my favorite aspects of this film. I also appreciated that they gave the audience an inside look at the aftermath once the victims finally were blessed to escape from captivity. I was blown away to see what life had brought for Carol and George, now 17 years old! Director Lenny Abrahamson creates such a big story in a small space.

I knew what the film was about but never watched a trailer for it. I assumed it was a story of the mom who happens to raise her kid in awful conditions but the focus is really on Jack and how he has to grow up in those awful conditions. Jacob Tremblay is an amazing little actor for being as young as he is here. He carried half the film on his own.
I wish we learned a little more about Old Nick and why he was doing what he did or what happened to him after, just a tad more than the tidbits we saw.
I do appreciate the fact that this didn't focus on the physical or sexual abuse, I can only think of 2 times either of those were shown or heard and they last maybe 15-30 seconds at most. The rest of it is implied and we can instead focus on Jack and Ma reacting to their situation and finding a way out of it all.
Brie Larson also does a fantastic job as Ma. I know those feelings of frustration and patience when it comes to kids and she absolutely nails it. Facial expressions and all.

549,31 July 2018,momster0005,9, Touches the Heart,"Here comes another award-winning supposed to be slayer. And guess what? It is the polar opposite of the same description. There's nothing embezzled about this movie that will shine.
Brie Larson plays the seven year long rape victim mother ""Ma"" of a boy who's just turned five and who is very happy in achieving this feat. Jacob Tremblay plays the role of 'Jack' the kid. Ma has raised her precocious son on her own. She has tricked Jack into believing that that 'room' is the beginning and end of this world and that there's nothing outside but space. She has in fact made a bed, school, bathroom and what not in that cramped little space that her captor Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers, has provided her with. There's a television set also on which everything is perceived as unreal and false by Jack for the lack of exposure to the outside world.
In an attempt to make it more plausible for us to believe, and probably for Jack too, that they can survive and get out of there someday, there's a skylight at the top of the room through which sunlight enters in the room during the day. All in vain of course. 
There is basically no story. You see them living inside a room first and then living outside the room after when they manage to escape in an episode that could not have been more childish where Ma instructs Jack to lie still after rolling him into a rug so that she can pretend his death and mourn over it when Old Nick comes home at night to have his daily quota of sex with her. The plan works and Jack escapes finally, until he is caught by Old Nick and surprisingly, is left behind safe by him after one fat guy watches him get manhandled by Old Nick. You almost feel like screaming,""Why O Why?"" Nick never comes back in the movie should be a serious enough indication about the kind of logic that was applied in the writing of this film. Nor does Ma ever get involved with him again. 
The real drama happens afterwards when the mother son duo have to live in Ma's parents house, who apparently have separated. Ma can't stand that house even since she isn't at good terms with her parents. Especially her father, whom she believes has been deliberately ignoring her son since they both stepped into the room. Ma also tries to commit suicide in a genuine attempt to apologize to Jack in a fanciful manner for ruining his childhood and treating him the way she did. The moment you think there's an interesting development being made the scene ends. And this happens enough times that you give up on the film altogether. 
As if the it wasn't enough tragic that both Ma and Jack visit that 'room' again towards the end of the film. That's when you realize your last couple of hours could have been more productive washing your car or making toast.",

The story is well told and intimately enveloped – both inside the room, as they cope and survive, and outside, as they adjust to a normalized life – and it has its moment of prisoner poetry, but it keeps it light on the drama strings as it filters the heaviness of psychological anguish through the prism of a 5-yr old boy. This could be seen as properly measured, of course, and preferable to most viewers, but I'd expect a more incisive and explorative recount, with all the squalor and darkness such abuse and rehabilitation would entail, before the opening to a new life. One also wonders about the missed chances of making enough noise to be noticed, and I spotted an obvious stylistic error in the camera vehicle's shadow as it follows the captor's truck.

Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a bright five-year old boy with hair down to his shoulders wakes up every morning saying hello to his universe. He does not greet the sun, the grass, the trees outside, where he could run and laugh and play like a normal five-year old but only to the objects he knows for five years as being ""the real world"", his world: the lamp, the sink, the plant, the refrigerator. His only friend is a mouse that he feeds, thinking that the mouse also lives in that little world, the only one real for him. Sometimes a man comes over, during the night, and then Jack must sleep in the wardrobe, not to be seen. The relationship mother-son appears to be normal: they cook, dance, laugh, stretch out, read about Alice, mother tells the tale of Monte Cristo. The poverty that surrounds them is not painful. The real pain and anger I felt when Jack could not believe that outside ""the room"" exists a real world, with real people, and trees, grass, leaves, seasons, snow. Then the reality strikes: captivity. A child born in captivity, because of a madman, a rapist. A story of a child whose life started in a cage having as a talisman his mother love and her tooth, thinking that ""his strong"" is in his long hair. Real world proves to be scarier than ""the room"". A movie that should be seen, a story that must be known, a boy that deserves all the awards: Jacob Tremblay.",

We're first introduced to our two main characters, twenty-something Ma (actress Brie Larson) and four year-old Jack (up-and-coming Jacob Tremblay), inside a garden shed. We are, of course, unaware that this is a garden shed, but the size is what's immediately noticeable. Small, dark, and dank, with a single skylight. Jack, the product of Ma's kidnapping despite her insistence of his immaculate conception, is oblivious to the space of the room, or lack thereof, and equally of the world outside it. Ma, we're later told, has been living in the confines for seven years. It's seven too many, and when she decides quite suddenly that some attempt must be made to free one or both of them, plans are quickly set in motion at her behest and against Jack's wishes.",

Both characters are absolutely believable and this movie really does break your heart. 
Where most movies would climax is only the half way point of this movie making for very interesting far from usual storytelling. 
Generally slow moving (but not in a bad way) I think maybe 20mins could have/should have been taken off and would make for a better overall film as it did feel like it was a bit long for what it could have been.

Seamlessly the film manages to portray happiness in a tragic way, depressingly dark situations yet present some optimism and make you feel genuinely scared and/or worried about its fictional characters. Room is emotional in a very real sense; it's not just another movie where a romance falls apart, or where a loved one gets a terminal illness and it doesn't tug on your heart strings with cheap bullshit. Room doesn't try to trick you into feeling things, its realistic tone and grim story is enough.

When I watched this movie, I started with a heartfelt admiration for my mother who still tried her best to give her children a happy childhood in such a small and closed room and a hard life!
As the child grows up, old Nick is unemployed, and the child may be in danger at any time. A power outage ushered in a good chance to escape. The mother began to plan an escape plan. At this point, she was completely dare not to breathe and kept staring with breath until they were rescued .
However, escaping was only the beginning, long-term isolation from the outside world, changes in fate, and the outside world 's doubts about the mother ""why not send the child to the welfare home and leave him in the room for five years"" The cage of the soul. What's wrong with her? Why was she questioned? She is just a helpful little girl, a mother who loves her children deeply. This time, the child once again saved her with love and gave her strength. And her family's line ""We pass power to each other, no one can be strong alone"" is really touching.

In the end I've compromised at 9/10. I must admit I tried to avoid this movie as I knew it would be a difficult watch, but ended up seeing it as someone else's choice on pay to view TV; I may have lost some of the impact of ""being there"" that I would have got from the big screen. By now thousands have reviewed the wonderful casting of and acting by the two leads and I concur completely. By five minutes in or less it's impossible to imagine the roles being played by anyone else. And child actor Jacob Tremblay is just astonishing as Jack, who was born in captivity so knows nothing but the claustrophobic world of ""room"". This really matters in the later stages when he has to cope with the wider world and we are truly drawn into his struggle to adapt and understand. As I always do, I have checked out one or two ""hated it"" reviews here and worry about some of those critics' ability to empathise, almost to a psychopathic degree. To me, Joy's behaviour is 100% convincing. After so long in captivity and with her child to protect you would absolutely expect her to have constructed a strategy for survival above all else, even if that means taking a submissive role with her captor.

If you don't know what's on the other side of the wall and don't even know the other side even exists, you feel safe. You don't doubt your freedom at all. Jack felt like everything is happening with a reason, just the way it should be. His imagination made him believe that. It was also quite interesting watching how Jack's thoughts broadened up as time was passing by. I was surprised how well he adapted to new surroundings, unlike his poor mother.

613,24 January 2016,EBWaxes84,7, Great performances and moments of lyrical beauty halted by a stagnant 2nd Act,"'Room' tackles a very dark and complex subject matter. It is centred on a fictional incident of a man abducting, imprisoning and raping a young woman for several years. There are many ways a writer or a filmmaker could approach this topic. Some may choose to play up the abuse to invoke a visceral reaction from the audience while others may focus on the resulting media blitz. ",

In all of his childlike curiosities and passions, he manages to bring joy to his mother, Joy. And he keeps her alive with his immeasurable, child-like, Sampson-esque, hopeful strength. At least three times he manages to save his mothers life. All because of the pure, unrefined love that comes of child- bearing and childhood dependence. ",
615,12 March 2016,brynjolfson,10, The Biggest Hero in Cinematic History: A 5-year old Boy,"Well its January 20th and the games already up. My favourite film of the year has already been watched. At least if it hasn't then this is really going to be a banner year. This is an incredible film with fantastic performances from the 2 leads. Brie Larson is, as is always the case, excellent, but is blown away by an unbelievable performance from young Jacob Tremblay. It can only be because of his tender years that he didn't receive Oscar recognition as I don't believe we will see a better performance this year. Of course a lot of the credit for this must go down to fantastic direction from Abrahamson. As for the film, it is abhorrent, terrifying, warm, emotional, uplifting and life affirming, and not necessarily in that order. Your emotions change from one way to another many times throughout the run time. The genius of the film is that it shows the world from the child's perspective, after watching imagine how it would have looked if it had been showed from the mothers and shiver.",

The movie was all over the place and the scenes were cut just when they would start to get interesting. Characters aren't psychologically developed. They're shallow and onedimnsional. The kid that went through so much trauma in his life came out completly normal. Sure, he's young, but there is no way he's undamaged after that. The mother, raped, abused, inprisoned, had some brakedowns, but none were solved onscreen. ",

622,18 April 2017,mahjoubrahma,7, good!,For a film with a low budget and limited locations this was an amazing film. The performance from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay was some of the best you'll see. The fact that half of the film was shot in one room shows how good the acting had to be and the film never got boring. The complex character developments and story telling was incredibly realistic. My favourite part of the film was that they didn't end it once they escaped but showed the effects of this situation on the extra characters. I liked how they didn't end with a happy ending but instead shows a more depressing grim but realistic story.,

But on top of everything we have Jack, and the world seeing through his eyes when he finally has a chance to have that encounter, furthermore, leaving us with the challenge, and that is, bring back that innocent being we all once had, as it was suffocated by the world we live in today. Jack shows how that can actually be done: white is white – simple is simple – real and not real Let the sun shine, even if it is through a small tiny skylight, for that we know there is a God above everything.",

This is a must watch for anyone who loves movies, stories and splendid acting. Brie Larson and Mr.Jacob - you guys were unbelievable, so natural, so emotional, I fell in love with both of you and can never get you out of my heart, you reached that very core and I can never take out your characters out and I do not want to!

625,14 January 2016,tatianadirashvili15,10, The best drama of 2016,"The best movie of the year by a mile. Arguably the best movie of 2010's till now. One of the most brilliant movies that has ever been put on screen. The world from child's perspective is innocent and hopeful and at the same time enlightening. In my humble opinion, the kid gives the best performance of the year excluding Rooney Mara in Carol. The movie has so many strong scenes that keep your heart racing, and literally make you cry. A great book to screen adaption by author Emma Donnoghue and Lenny Abrahamson. The production house A24 has been doing really good this year, 1st with Ex Machina and now with Room. Brie Larson is finally getting the attention that she deserves thanks to the movie, although I liked her performance in Short Term 12 way better.",

630,18 June 2016,Faisalbatcha,8, Patience yet rewarding,"I didn't read the original novel and knew very little about the plot when I saw this movie. It captivated me from the very first second. As the story develops, I was thinking of a dramatic scene to turn the situation over but it was done naturally without a flaw. That makes it powerful and convincing enough to add to the genuine feel to the movie. The best part of the story comes when joy was rescued. The tensions between her and her son, dad and mom are so real and strong yet subtle. The protective-possessive syndrome of Joy just highlights the essence of the whole captive situation. Victim victimises. I highly recommend this film to anyone who are interested to explore something deeper into human emotion especially to all the child psychologist or therapist out there.",

Enjoyable from beginning to end, Room surprises with emotional depth, light touches of humor, and steady character studies in a plot that at first appears simple, but never is. The characters are so fully embodied and so realistically do they move through the film that it's easy to forget this is not a documentary. It's a lovingly made film where everything counts and no one is forgotten.",

So with that being said and out of the way, WOW! I have seen this movie five times already and each time I see it it's like watching it for the first time. I cry and I feel like my whole body feels every emotion Brie Larson conveys through her portrayal of Joy. As for Jacob Tremblay for such a young actor I feel he nails his character Jack on the head perfectly. For anyone who has children you will most definitely get chills watching this film. I believe it was written so well and executed beautifully. The way the story is told and how was absolutely genius. I feel as if its a hard movie to describe to someone without giving away any aspects to the film. Room is a movie that makes you look at things a slight bit different. Makes you questions things you might not normally question. Gives you a contrary perspective on how what may be ""normal"" on the outside isn't what it seems.",

Though there is a glimpse into the horrors of being what it's like to experience being locked up by a twisted, cruel captor for many years inside his small garden shed, the plot also emphasises the struggles they face when having to face the real world that lays outside of 'Room'. Yet through it all, the deep and unbreakable bond between Ma and her little boy, Jack, which punctuates virtually every scene, is what makes this film so moving and never ceases to uplift.",

With a very hard and deep topic, solid performances and the greatest photographer, screen-writers, directors,etc ever, Room will be one of my all-time-favorite-heart-breaking-movies. You want to cry? Just give this movie like, ten minutes, ant then we talk. Another great thing about Room is that, yeah, it's heart-breaking, it deals with a pretty taboo topic and is very real; but at the same tame is fast-passing and its so easy to connect with the characters...

I found the movie captivating, possibly because I haven't made the same close connection as Jack did with his mom and it really pulled at my heartstrings. It's surprising though how people rate it low, citing plotholes and questions that were actually answered in the movie. I'm a big reader of crime news and Ma's story and reasons for her actions were very believable and reasonable. The first half of the story was very thrilling and the second half actually falls a bit flat, but it's a realistic representation of life. People who expect things to continue with ""and they live happily ever after"" will be disappointed.The story is also meant to be seen as it is - focused on the psyche of the two main characters. If you want to go deeper than that, then make your own movie. Overall, I think it's well-done and it deserved the recognition it got.",

It feels very menacing the whole way through, as things aren't all sunshine and rainbows on the outside. There is very little musical score to the film, which I think makes the film feel even more empty and desolate. The child actor Jacob Tremblay, who plays Jack, is very good in this, one of the best child actors I have ever seen. And yes, the child is a boy and is played by a boy, despite how he looks for the majority of the film, which some film-goers around me at the cinema were shocked to find out.
