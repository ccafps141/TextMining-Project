1,22 December 2020,srcooper-756-646671,10, Is it possible the makers understand how incredible this film is?,"You only get to watch this for the first time once, so choose your state of mind carefully.
It is a film about movies and dreams and reality, and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter.
It is spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing.
It is beautiful and absorbing.
It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen.
I don't see it often, in case it's not as good as I like to remember it.
That is my secret, that I lock away in my safe in the basement.
That somewhere there is a perfect world for us all.
For some, perhaps it is in the cinema watching this.",r

Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?",i
5,13 July 2010,D_Burke,10," In a Decade, ""Inception"" May Be A Religion","Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. ""Inception"" is no exception to that rule, but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion (i.e. ""The Matrix"" (1999), ""The Cell"" (2000), ""Abre Los Ojos"" (1997) & its American remake ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001)), you really can't look away, nor should you.",e
6,2 December 2010,planktonrules,8, Amazingly original...but also a bit overwhelming.,"This review is being written by a 46 year-old guy. I mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important, as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie more--and can take the fast-paced action and frenetic pace. I assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film. Just something to consider as you read this.",w

8,8 February 2020,Ch4ndler_B1ng,10, Didn't win Best Picture? WHAT?,"Inception is as original as you can get with a sci-fi movie. I feel like it's kind of pointless to compare this to Blade Runner, Aliens, Terminator 2, 2001: A Space Odyssey or any other sci-fi blockbusters, for they're completely different. What Nolan crafted is genius, in my mind he is still yet to make a bad movie, it is now time to get into spoiler territory.",r

Remarkable and breathtaking.",w
10,15 July 2010,dvc5159,8, Sci-fi perfection. A truly mesmerizing film.,"I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to ""The Dark Knight"", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.",6
11,4 June 2021,lhbaker-28783,10, My number one favorite movie,"Inception is my number one favorite movie off my twelve years on earth! It's absolutely impossible to explain the incredible that Inception has. Inception is Sooooooooo dang exciting, edge of seat, mind blower, and I wish there were more movies like it and more Christopher Nolans out there. Congratulations to the well deserved best director, writer, and producer of films (in my opinion). Also the acting is fabulous, everyone did an amazing job, and Leonardo was fabulous at explaining the dream concept. Also the CGI and effects are amazing. Go watch Inception because it is incredibly amazing in every aspect, and is my number one film of my twelve years on earth. Bravo to the Inception crew and wow at this fabulous movie!",0

14,13 July 2010,marcusdean118,10, Nolan at his most intelligent best.,"Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.",8
15,7 April 2011,hitchcockthelegend,9, This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.,"Inception is written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. The musical score is by Hans Zimmer and Wally Pfister is the cinematographer. Plot finds DiCaprio playing Dom Cobb, a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people. But one day he gets a different offer, one that will enable him to see his estranged children. To get his reward he must enact Inception, the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target. But Inception is thought impossible and should Cobb and his selected team fail? The consequences are unthinkable.",2
16,12 July 2010,chaaa,10, The perfect summer blockbuster?,"What do we ask for in a summer blockbuster? What is it that incites hysteria this time every year for whatever dross the studios churn out? Epic hugeness? Blowing stuff up? Romance? Action? Heroes? What are we looking for in a blockbuster? I think it all boils down to thrills! Audiences want the thrill of a car chase, the thrill of romance, the thrill of the spectacular! If that is the case, then Inception just might be the greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it also contains something we often don't look for...brains! ""What is the most resilient parasite? An idea"" says Leonardo Di Caprio's character Cobb. Well, Inception is all about ideas. It's all right there in the title. The film central idea revolves around ""Extractors"", who are paid to extract secrets from people's subconscious minds by sneaking into their dreams, usually for the purpose of corporate espionage. However, when one client asks them to plant an idea in the mind of their corporate rival, ""Inception"" is born. The less said about this film the better. It is full of ideas and invention and for each set piece I divulge, a piece of the film's genius is weakened. This is a film that cleverly and intricately brings the audience through several planes of existence simultaneously but never allows the viewer to feel lost. Such is the power of Christopher Nolan's script which, I imagine, is likely to get overlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction. But everything that makes this film so great is in the script...in the ideas! Everything else is just spectacle. This film bears an uncanny resemblance, thematically, with DiCaprio's other instant classic this year, Shutter Island. Both films investigate in depth the tricks a traumatised mind can play on the individual. Both films are luscious to watch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm of reality. However, Inception is an even more layered film than Shutter Island and I believe the sci-fi genre setting will prove to be less alienating for audiences than the prison noir of Scorsese's film. There is not a single dull moment in Nolan's film. There is style, charm and intelligence in every frame of the film. Every performance is pitch-perfect with some strong support by Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into undeniable movie stars. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically flawless performance as the muddled, grieving man who we never quite trust to be living in the real world. The best part of Inception is the large amount of effects which were done in camera. While the film does make use of CGI, there are some pretty mind-blowing practical effects which are as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies; a rare treat these days. This is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes; smart, sexy (femme fatale, sexy brainy girl, very beautiful men in very beautiful suits) and magical. Inception is the kind of film that reminds me why cinema will never die. Because anyone who thinks it's OK to watch this film on a laptop or iPad is a fool! This is pure cinema, and proud of it. Not to be missed on the big screen!",5
17,31 July 2010,Hitchcoc,10, Come Back Again!,"If one goes to an art gallery to see a provocative piece, one sees something new each time. That's what true art is. That's why a black light Elvis is not art. This film is certainly a tour de force. It requires engagement at every step. LIke most works of art, it doesn't give it all away. I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time. First of all, the premise is wonderfully engaging. Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened, only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends. While confusing, it's exciting. The amazing thing is that the director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness. We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss. We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed. We care about the matrix of the dream levels. Great movie.",/
18,23 August 2010,funkyfry,6, All right.....,"The film is a disappointment, because it did so little with so much. Basically what you have here is a very interesting sci-fi heist premise; Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are partners who use dream-invasion technology to steal industrial secrets from unsuspecting mass transit passengers (why any powerful people in such a technological age would travel on mass transit, is just one of the many obvious questions the film expects us not to raise) while they doze. In exchange for immunity to a troubling criminal charge against Cobb, they agree to undertake an unprecedented mission: to practice ""inception"" on a powerful business scion, that is to plant an original idea in his subconscious through the dream manipulation.",?
19,26 July 2010,murtaza_mma,9," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Buñuel meets Kubrick in Nolan's most ambitious venture, till date","Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them. ",r

21,25 July 2010,Carl_Tait,5, Good idea lost in the noise,"The central idea of ""Inception"" is an interesting one: technology exists to enter other people's dreams in order to steal their most private secrets or to implant new ideas. With Christopher Nolan of ""Memento"" fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, ""Inception"" is a bloated failure.",f

If you have seen the trailer to this movie, you know that it doesn't explain too much. But I saw Inception today and all I can say is: Wow! With an incredible cast and amazing director, you just can't go wrong. Inception is a movie that not only makes you think but can start a whole conversation with what you just saw on the screen. It's a very clever story that is told with skill and passion, while you do have to pay attention, I loved that it made me think. One of my friends saw a premiere and told me how he would have to see it again to understand it, but I didn't get that when I saw it today. But I would love to see the movie again, I have no problem with that. Between the performances, the story, the sounds, the editing and the incredible effects, I would love to watch this movie over and over again, it's my favorite film of the year so far.",_

27,21 July 2010,Doylenf,6, Dream invasion is the focus of a strange and ambiguous film...,I'll be the first one to admit that INCEPTION is the kind of thinking man's thriller that has something going on every second of its two-hour and 28 minute running time.

It has you questioning reality all the way through; in some ways similar to The Matrix, I suppose, although it's more obvious in this movie that there's questioning about reality to be done. This movie, however, lacks the philosophical/religious elements that The Matrix had, and stands as a pretty formulaic action type movie with the issues about reality thrown in.",v
30,15 January 2011,paul2001sw-1,4, So much less intelligent than it seems,"Ten years ago, Christopher Nolan wrote and directed the brilliant 'Momento', a stunning thriller that pushed the boundaries of storytelling convention. It was great, but still, one couldn't help wondering, where would Nolan go from here? How could he trump this achievement? In fact, although his subsequent films have been praised, they've been less distinctive, but with 'Inception', he returns to his adventurous roots, producing a story that is even more audacious than 'Momento'; and unfortunately, the result is dreadful. And worse than the fact that it doesn't really work is the fact that while it is distinctive, it is distinctive in a very conventional way. Since his early success, Nolan has taken work from big studios, and 'Inception' is no exception; and the result is a Hollywood movie straining desperately to stand out, instead of something more truly independent. in spirit.",

I cannot ignore hype, especially when it's already on the IMDb top 250, it received praise from critics, cashed in a lot of money, and people call it stunning and unforgettable. The simple truth is that Inception does not live up to the hype. Let me start with the trailer. All the coolest things (the folding city, the collapsing cliffs, the train in the street) are totally unessential to the plot. None of that takes more than a few seconds. So why did they put them on all the posters as well? Nevermind. I'll move on to the real problems of the movie.",

It's a science fiction film that takes dream analysis to several new levels.

37,17 July 2010,spaaw,10, Inception - A benchmark in all cinema to come.,"Many of us, not least those who populate the online world with movie reviews, observations and criticisms, are aware of Chris Nolan's raw talent. Memento broke onto the screen a decade ago and provided us with a spectacle in story telling so rare that it dumbfounded us. Since then, Nolan has gained huge popularity with his revival of the Batman franchise, and even more so with the stunning Dark Knight - that still has yet to relinquish its grip on modern day cinema - with the genius of The Prestige sandwiched in between.",
38,7 March 2011,Turfseer,4, Sort of like a pastiche of mediocre action adventure espionage thrillers dating back to the 60s,"Before Leonardo DiCaprio agreed to play the lead part in 'Inception', he spent months with Christopher Nolan trying to improve the script. It was at DiCaprio's insistence that the part he was playing, Cobb, the corporate dream extractor, had to have a more beefed up internal arc. Otherwise, Inception would turn out to be another shallow, action adventure thriller. Despite Cobb's triumph over his internal demons (particularly the way in which he expunges his dead wife, who has been haunting him in his subconscious), Inception is much more an exploration of the mechanics of dreaming than a chronicle of emotional catharsis.

Nolan goes one up however, with this attempt as he, like Neo, goes beyond the computerized world of the Matrix, where it's still a construct led by binary ones and zeroes, good and evil battling it out under black and white rules. Rules that one cannot escape from since they are what binds our universe together. Here Nolan goes into that untapped power of the mind, the dream worlds that we create in our subconscious, where the dreamer has everything in his subtle control, where anything goes as far as the imagination dare venture beyond physical limitations and rules.",

I don't think the story came out quite the way Nolan had hoped, after working on it for over a decade. In my view the story is basically a combination of Vanilla Sky meets The Matrix, but really it ends up being less meaningful than both (A combination of the mystical waking dream and the matrix of consciousness). This is Nolan's version of Edgar Allan Poe's A Dream Within A Dream, or the like.

52,9 June 2020,briancham1994,6, Not impressed,"This movie was (and is) beloved by everyone so I don't expect to make any friends with my honest opinion - I was not impressed by Inception. Before I first watched this film, I was told that it would be complex and mind-blowing so I expected something like Nolan's earlier The Prestige (2006) which was masterful and one of my favourite films. Instead, we get a shallow imitation of that style. Inception is complex just for the sake of being complex - it doesn't add much value to the film, and the complexity is just overloading the audience's working memory which is not a clever technique at all. The characters were the worst part of the film. Apart from the main characters, they basically have no existence outside their role in the mission. We don't have any other reason to care about them. After a point, I just completely stopped caring whether they succeeded. Nothing felt compelling or of much consequence. I actually cared more about Cilian Murphy's character than the protagonists, to be honest. Because I lost my investment in the film, it just dragged out and became boring, especially some of the generic action scenes like the one in the snow. The ending is just cheap ambiguity rather than anything meaningful. That said, there were some good things about the film that I enjoyed. The visuals and effects were great, such as the transforming cities and the zero gravity. The best part was Hans Zimmer's score which remains one of my favourite soundtracks. Those aspects almost made up for the flaws - almost.",

The film was about 45 minutes too long. The concept is very interesting, but there are so many loopholes and unanswered questions and illogical contrivances that we both just shook our heads and enjoyed the scenery. I have to wonder where all of the high ratings for this flick are coming from. I am not buying that as many people loved this thing on the same par as Lord of the Rings and Godfather.

Inception is a product of a director who has been given carte blanche. His vision has been put on film without someone ever saying: 'Chris, that's not going to work.' For that matter, Inception should have been Nolan's Heaven's Gate. But Inception will probably make Nolan a even bigger star.

This film was just 'ok' by anyone's standards, except maybe the plethora of teenagers that love anything that includes lots of gun fire and 'splosions. The plot was unnecessarily convoluted and chock full of lazy writing. I have really liked Chris Nolan's work, so this is not a personal attack on him; it's just nowhere near as slick as others have claimed. The biggest symptoms of lazy writing are: constant exposition in the guise of conversation, constant changing of rules set up earlier in the movie and supposedly brilliant people making illogical choices, when the plot demands it. Many have said that those of us who didn't like it were just clueless and didn't ""get it"". What's to get? The plot was not difficult to understand, just difficult to accept as anything that made any sense. A dream with a dream within a dream. Big effing deal! I bought this film on DVD and couldn't wait to see it as so many people had hailed it as the best thing since Citizen Kane. I was left feeling empty and ripped off, then again, there is an entire generation that claims ""Transformers"" and ""Independence Day"" are two of the best films ever made. I fail to understand how this over-blown, over-hyped film could garner such high ratings unless the people doing the rating have never seen a movie over 20 ears old. The concept was high-minded but the execution was pure popcorn-munching tripe. While I'll admit the cinematography was gorgeous and the acting was fairly well done, it was just so empty. As others have pointed out, when it's all just a dream, there's not a lot of tension when faceless people are shooting at you. Just plain silly, I say.

This movie is the most un-dreamy movie ever made, and as critics have said since the beginning of moving pictures, watching a movie is like dreaming with your eyes open. Colin McGinn covers this in great depth in his book ""The Power of Movies"", in which he discusses the spatio-temporal discontinuity in films: the camera can record a given scene and then leap to another place and time entirely. This is what movies do! Nolan treats this heavy-handed hopping about as if he's discovered something. What he's lost is the mysterious, moody, enigmatic quality of dreams, the tremendous emotional wallop. ""Inception"" is so detailed, so measured, with constant explication, that nothing is left to the imagination. How ironic is that? And to fill a movie about dreams with carefully designed car chases, gun battles, and mayhem of all kind...it's anti-dreaming. I've never watched a film so awake, so aware of itself, so full of itself.

Well did it ? This is what is a most unusual point to all this,and that would be if this particular film did not make money what else is this film doing if in fact it did not make money? What is required to know better or perhaps to truly know well what the viewer is looking at when as a viewer,the viewer as it were watches the motion picture ""Inception"".There is as well another consideration and that is if in fact the very participation in the watching of any motion picture is such an experience as to be a unwholesome experience. I believe it is that(unwholesome) and even more so provides for a disguise so to mislead any who might be drawn for what ever reason to watch such a film or for that matter to watch such are the films of Hollywood,California.There is no degree of involvement in the making of this film that is in fact authentic and as illegitimate that that might sound like it is an illegal search and seizure which allows a thief to be masqueraded as the man with the candy.This film is not new nor is this film what it appears as is as well.The result when viewing such a film is that there is no time that is real nor is there a place as to any particular event is concerned and if that isn't enough there is no definition as to not if there is a capacity to dream but how do we provide the ability to interject another ability that could pass as a dream.This is the handiwork of a masquerade with any here who believe believe not in this motion picture as there is no dreaming there is only the ability to transmit the stimulus with the image that is what masquerades as a ""dream"".It is as well imposed upon the body of the human race so to provide a unmistakable influence.The influence as the film provides such a witness has a goal of influence pure and simple this film is merely more of the same as the same has meant since as it were its inception.It is its invention that is at the source of this worlds ability to influence anything with merely more of the same being all that the viewer will ever be looking at.The inventor as well as the inventors many inventions are all patented and do it is believed remain so.There were some 700 separate inventions with which this unwholesome day in this world occurred when one Nicola Tesla discovered how to bind energy across wide open space many many miles from nowhere including even deepest darkest space.This is the field of regard it is as well the ability to network with many disparaging elements so to influence even say Adolf Hitler(I kid you not).Though 1920 is the year of radio's invention and 1921 the year Berlin radio started to broadcast it was a good time before this point in time that Tesla's inventions and subsequent patents were in place.The better premise would be to know through Tesla's own words as to what capacity does what he invented provide and without to much trouble Tesla's's own misgivings provide for the very problem of being under the influence of a lie.Though this lie was not meant to interfere with the human race that is exactly what has occurred.The money men of Teslas's own day are at the root cause as to the necessity to influence anything outside of an antenna.They remain as perhaps a cog in the wheel that very nearly saw to its conclusion not to long ago.This wasn't Tesla's design this was there influence on his attempt to bind energy that it was not to be unless of course they could extract a measure if you will of revenge upon humanity.This is the masquerade that there is a profit motive in this foreign power as well as an aggression not to be deterred in its inability to be regulated properly.This is an imperfect science which has meted out suffering through this field of regard.(network field)It is this thief in the night and it is as well the exploiter of human flesh that this film is providing the viewer with.This is what this film is up to and it has been such since it inception.",

But this film is all over the place, just to many angle's with in an angle. Leonardo has made some great films, but after Shutter Island I became less of a fan. I rate Shutter Island only slightly better, but both are a let down for me. I am sure lots of people will dislike my take on this over hyped film, what kills the story for me, it has all these different layers inside layers, sure the idea is O.K but it is not very well done in this film, just one big mess of special effects, that leaves me just feeling very flat.

I never do this, commenting on a movie I haven't seen in its entirety, but I will make an exception in this case because it reeked of pretentious and ""interesting"" from the very start. Christopher Nolan must be so full of it by now, with the success of the Batman series, that he thinks he can discard some platitude on to the screen, by relying on big stars and some teenage fantasy...and by the way, other than Watanabe,Caine and Berenger, what's with all the teenage looking actors (I have to admit, good ones)? For a second there, I thought they are turning Beverly Hills 90210 into a movie. I admire Leonardo di Caprio as an actor, but if I ever see him in an action man-hero sequence again, I'll call Kate Winslet to squash him like a bug (in Titanic, she looked huge compared to him),he's just not believable in those roles (and I thought Charlie Sheen looked ridiculous in the 80' s and '90's) no matter how much he tries, sometimes it works sufficiently, sometimes it doesn't but the fact that he seems to look for those roles all the time, and what a shame, compared to his earlier roles.",

And Interstellar is coming in a few months so I guess now is a good time to celebrate one of the greatest films of all time. After dozens of times watching this movie I ranked it as my third favorite movie of all time. Rightfully so, considering it's one of the few movies that changed my life and got me infinitely interested in film in general. From top to bottom this is one true cinematic accomplishment. Christopher Nolan created a worldwide phenomena and did it with an original idea. Popular and financially successful movies these days almost always have to be part of a bigger franchise. Inception made nearly a billion dollars while being just a solo outing. This wasn't Nolan's first home run twisting our minds and it won't be his last but he most likely won't create a more original movie than Inception. It's one of those movies that after you see it, you instantly want to go back and watch it again.",

Ridiculous ,shockingly bad,laughable but clever(clever in that they succeeded, in taking money from my pocket, for watching it).When i have watched over maybe 5000 films ,i used to gloat that i can smell from kilometers away the ""potatoes""(a phrase that means really really bad films).Not any more.Maybe when i reach 10000 films, i will have the power to save my self from the next Inception.",

Go home!"" It had a decent idea but I have to think that Rod Serling (RIP) probably could have done a much better job with this and he would have done it in a shorter time.

I don't know why this movie got so much praise, it's a pointless sci-fi movie that should have gone straight to video. I see some reviews say this movie was better than Star Wars, you have got to be kidding. Unlike Inception Star Wars had a great story, the actors even though unknown at the time impressed me; and the special effects-WOW. I must say Star Wars blows Inception out of the water still to this day. To anyone who doesn't think so must be too young to know that it took a lot more effort in the 70's to make a great film. I was really disappointed in Inception, I thought since Nolan did The Dark Knight movies this would be another success. This movie was slow, boring and really had no plot. The only thing I took from it was it was a dreams and getting into peoples heads in there most vulnerable time while they are dreaming. The ending was a WTF ending the kind that can make or break movies, but since this on was broken from the start the ending really didn't surprise me. To all who want to see a great sci-fi movie pick up the classic, like Alein, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Equilibrium, ETC.. I know from watching these movies and being a big fan of the SW saga, you won't be disappointed. Hey BTW, looking for a great TV Mini-series blockbuster from the 80's checkout V and V-The Final Battle, these movies are classics and I would recommend them to anyone who likes a great sci-fi movie.",

118,18 November 2021,mollyshelhamer,10, Perfect for Sci-Fi Fans,"Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" (2010) is a complex science fiction thriller about a group of people with varying specific skills that create a perfect team of dream-sharers. Dom Cobb, the main protagonist, is an extractor who is able to find out people's secrets by intruding into their dreams. His right-hand is Arthur, who researches and plans what they are trying to accomplish in a dream. Bright graduate student Ariadne is the architect for the dreams, meaning she literally constructs the physical aspects of a dreamscape. Eames is a professional at turning into anyone else in a dream, almost like shapeshifting. Lastly, Yusuf is a chemist who creates perfect concoctions of sedatives to achieve ideal conditions for the dreams to take place. This elaborate combination of characters is asked by a rich businessman, Saito, to infiltrate his dying competitor's son, Robert Fischer's, dream and place an idea in his mind so that Saito's business can become more successful. Traveling through the layers of someone's mind and making them think of an idea on their own is what they call ""inception."" Cobb is dedicated to making this happen so that Saito can arrange for Cobb's return to America to see his children. Without Saito, Cobb would not be able to return to America because of his alleged criminal background, but Saito has connections and power to clear his name. Some members of his team think achieving inception is impossible, but Cobb convinces them to be on board and they must come up with a mastermind plan with no room for error to achieve this extremely difficult yet imperative task. They begin a three-layer plan that involves elaborate depths of the dream dimension, taking advantage of Fischer's sensitive and dysfunctional relationship with his father, practiced methods of leaving a dream and entering the next, all while trying to avoid Cobb's wife Mal who lives in his subconscious and often sabotages his plans. The shocking ending leaves viewers at a cliffhanger and fans theorizing.",

120,16 July 2010,Polaris_DiB,6, Just try to go to sleep,"People love to talk about the relationship between cinema and dreams. As a slightly surreal artform in and of itself, directors and artists have always tweaked with the filmic space of perception to achieve dream or dream-like effects. The problem I typically find in almost all movies attempting to recreate dreams is that they do so in too literal a way, often drawing attention to the dream effect they are portraying. This becomes even more difficult to pull off in movies that question the line between dreams and reality (a much more obvious line than pop philosophy ever really acknowledges) pretty much have to point out the dream techniques of the production you are watching. This is Nolan's central dilemma, and one he doesn't really manage to transcend. As a visual invention in technical prestidigitation, this movie is successful, but it is too bogged down by exposition to really let its dream-scapes breathe.",

The acting was wooden, which is due to the bad script because each of these actors can hold their own elsewhere. The pacing is glacial. We are continually being preached at about the subconscious, but it's all like an Agatha Christie novel, with a surprise, unforeseen and unannounced deus ex machina just popping up here and there to wrap things up.

This is simply the most overrated film after Nolan's Dark Knight, supposedly intended to represent a pinnacle of intellectualism, originality, and ideas never before even hinted at. But, all in all, this is nothing but two and a half hours of utter and sheer nonsense, a real viewing terror, a debasement of a genre! It is in the limitless realm of quasi-Freudian, or is it Yungian ?, philosophy, e.g., a dream fixing, and the main actors are faced with a difficult task of deciphering the way to create the dream within the dream within the dream, and when you expect to see some true scary Freudian elements or dream symbolisms of destruction and, God Forbid, sex, no, you are left in the cold with your feet dangling in the aforementioned 'within loops', as sexuality, as we all know, is the source of all the modern evils, and as this film is intended for all and sundry, e.g. like a pleasant, 'wellness ' relaxation after a really exhausting 3-hour shopping spree, the family must let some steam off in the nearby cinema, and ,voila, Inception is here with a correctly calibrated dose of illogical shooting and explosions ( at least I got to see the technology and weapons the Alpine units today use ), and ,yes, not only DiCaprio survives , everybody else fares the same, so have no fear, Nolan is here! But, the damn time, it just won't follow the film's logic, 140 minutes is a heck of a time to kill the boiling fury over this total waste of money, time and personal dignity.

What purports to be a breakthrough film about dreams, turned out to be a first-rate, high-budget snooze fest. The writer couldn't decide, I suppose, whether he wanted to do a James Bond movie or the Matrix or the Thirteen Floor. Leo Dicapprio's character is insipid. Ellen Page's character is two sentences short of a paragraph. Everyone else was unmemorable. I couldn't care less if anyone lived or died. Nothing really made much sense. And don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the Thirteenth Floor and the Matrix (though the sequels were blech!). Christopher Nolan did a great job with Memento and Batman Begins and the Dark Knight, but OMG, what was everyone thinking? Apparently, I, too, am in a nightmare, looking at the great reviews. And while the special effects were eye-catching, they were not mind boggling. Two clenched fists for this one. Methinks now, I'll just go and watch Green Lantern and do myself in.",
131,9 August 2011,Ziya90,7, Mr. Nolan is like a cold mathematician,"Where should I start? It would be better to get straight to the point. Firstly, despite the idea is brilliant, in other words, generally the story of the movie is brilliant, ideas don't make a movie great as just complicatedness doesn't make a movie good. By this movie, personally, I have understood that Nolan is not ""my director"". The Dark Knight was also a serious disappointment for me and Batman Begins was just a summer blockbuster (Following and Prestige were very very good) As for Inception, the biggest flaw of the movie is the movie is lack of heart and soul, in other words, it is cold. The characters are cold, the atmosphere is cold, the reactions are cold, because they are in dream? Well, I don't think so. It causes what then? I didn't much care about the intrigue, couldn't identify with the characters, so the most important problem of the movie is its dramatic structure. The second is the ""dreams"" itself. You know, the agent of dreams in cinema is David Lynch. Why? Because he shoots creative, intriguing, sometimes meaningless as it should be and surreal dream sequences. The dream sequences in Inception can only impress the architects, mathematicians and some businessmen (because there are a lot of men in black suit) It is because like his approach towards Batman, he sticks to reality. Despite the visual effects are jaw dropping, ""the street bending"" scene is my favorite, it doesn't help much. By the way, honestly, I couldn't understand the trick of Ariadne, for example, is it planned or impromptu? If the point is impressiveness, well I was much more impressed by Sucker Punch for example which has been exposed to harsh reviews. The movie also has not any dramatic twist, epic scene (except for a few moments) or real mystery which had been all necessary in my opinion. Can we say that the movie was low key? Thirdly, some, may be many action scenes seem pointless and ineffective. Especially the ""snow"" sequence. It was too long without real entertainment or excitement. There is not any problem with the cast (except the fact that in contrast with the majority, I think that Leonardo Di Caprio's performance in this movie was just good, not his best performance so far, it is nothing, for example in comparison with What's eating Gilbert Grape!), but it is a bit disappointing that Nolan often uses the same actors in his movies. A note: Michael Caine's character might be a tribute for his character in Children of Men. If you ask me, the best part of the movie is the ""train scene"" It was the only scene that I was dramatically involved and got excited. The ""gravity"" sequence was just interesting. I didn't find it epic. Finally, about the plot, I didn't find the starting point creative, brilliant or exciting. I mean the concept of choosing a businessman for inception, weren't there better options? In other words, the main story was too poor for the concept. However, if we consider Nolan's style, to tell a story about the world of business, might be exciting for him. However, if we consider the hype, the rating, the reviews etc. it seems that Mr. Nolan has deluded audiences again or we have been incepted.",

That main idea though, is something very unique and creative that is brought to life by outstanding filmmaking, everything you'd expect from a Christopher Nolan film. Writing and performances are also great across the board. The only problem with Inception is in ones own interpretation.

I cannot count how many of these movies are being made, and most of them are using the same repetitive path - what you think is reality isn't - the one who's in charge - or 'In the know' is the one who's psycho, schizophrenic, or mentally unstable. I was surprised that after Leo did Shutter Island, that he'd just turn around and do the same kind of movie. (For those who didn't notice - the top kept spinning in the end shot - meaning he was dreaming - not actually awake - which means he was the one all along who was in err). The acting was a bit over the top and not convincing enough. The script wasn't that great, and I already can visualize certain types of people making attempts to practice this sort of thing. Among those 'certain types' you will also find hoards of conversations about 'lucid dreaming' and 'out of body experience', huge attractions to witchcraft, Harry Potter, etc, 'reality' shows, trash TV, RPG's and other games - basically - a lot of fantasy and unreality type of attractions. This movie will be a cult classic to them, maybe even their bible. The good thing about this movie does indeed need to be noted, however. We are living in an unreality & fantasy based society and it's ever growing. This movie shows the dangers of living in in that kind of mode, where a person starts getting more and more confused about what is real and what isn't. I ended up fast forwarding through quite a bit.

I never got the enthusiasm for this flick. It was somewhat entertaining, although, certainly not mind blowing or even that inventive. I've seen more mind bending things on the Outer Limits from the 60's. It was not memorable. In fact, I had forgotten about it until last night. One of the things I remember was how poorly Ellen Page's character was rounded out. I remember laughing, not at her - but at the part she had to play, Ms. Exposition. Explain everything to her, so the audience knows what is going on. The action was cliché, and left me wanting more. The whole thing about going into someone's dream is so silly, but not funny silly - which leads me to...",

He is an excellent director when he is given a project that isn't overly ambitious. With his more ""epic"", ""blockbuster"" films though, he shows a lot more weaknesses. Nothing illustrates those weaknesses more than Inception. It is a movie that starts off at the same level as Memento, but declines and hits rock bottom on the same level as the recent Transformers movies. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the last 45 minutes or so of the movie is that bad.

I prefer action that has more relevance when I am watching a film. The film's main focus is dreams, but I did not feel like I was in a dream, only a web of destruction at the hands of computer generated explosions!

Under the incoherent, made-up-as-we-go logic, the film is but a low-grade action film in a sci-fi disguise.

182,5 August 2010,moonspinner55,7," ""Take a leap of faith...""","Writer-director Christopher Nolan's byzantine puzzle-movie ""Inception"" is so fully engulfed in a surreal sort of Raison d'être--while also managing to introduce a new set of rules to us, though not appearing to abide by those rules near the finale--it's easy to understand why some audiences are embracing the film as a masterpiece. These days, if a film is complexly-layered it is automatically deemed art...not popcorn entertainment ready for mass consumption, but high art. If ""small minds"" are unable to grasp the film's deeper meanings, those poor folks are disregarded as unworthy participants in the ultimate game. ""Inception"" is a game--and, at times, a grand one--but it isn't a masterpiece. It's a gun-crazy, gadget-mad, hyperactive Rubik's Cube of a movie. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the grieving Cobb, a dream extractor who enters into the sleeping minds of others to gather vital information which cannot be obtained any other way. Unfortunately, memories of his late wife (and guilt over her mysterious death) are so vivid they are permeating Cobb's subconscious; and inevitably those haunted images follow him helplessly on his jaunts into the dream-state. The movie has very little exposition, with a confusing prologue later revealed to be the starter threads to the epilogue, and doesn't really get going until we are introduced to Cobb's latest case involving a dying billionaire, his crestfallen son, and the final draft of the tycoon's will which is locked up in a safe no one knows the combination to. The other participants in the project are a brainy, adept, and engaging group of people we become quite fond of; often times, particularly in a perplexing movie such as this one, having such smart, savvy characters populating the scenario makes the ride that much more enjoyable (not forgetting of course that humans are never so vulnerable to danger as when they are asleep). What doesn't really work are the constant sniper attacks in the dreams--projections which manifest themselves as an angry militia--as well as a visual impersonation of the son's godfather, which is necessary to the plot but becomes little more than a complicated footnote. The level of dreams our heroes pass through, one more dangerous than the last, provide the picture with a visual kick, and the nonchalant manner in which the characters respond to their strange new surroundings accent ""Inception"" with a giddiness not usually found in big-budget action films. I'm not sure whether or not Christopher Nolan violates his own movie-rules in order to cap the film with an emotional bow, but he does get solid performances from his cast, a rich and delectable production design from his art department, and swirling, hallucinogenic special effects from his creative team. Is the movie a mind-blowing experience? For many audiences, it certainly will be. As with all 'summer epics' and popcorn crowd-pleasers, this one's crazy glow will probably fade in the stretch (I can't imagine the film will hold up so well once it goes the home-video route--it's a theatrical experience, after all). It is not a work of art, however that doesn't mean it isn't sheer pleasure from start to finish. *** from ****",

I know you cannot re-invent the wheel, but why-- why does everybody have a h#@$-on for everything this man does? ""The Dark Knight."" ""The Prestige."" Is anybody going to ever tell this man that he's not Stanley Kubrick? Or does he surround himself with yes-men the same way that George Lucas does? He hasn't graduated from the James Cameron School of Arrogance yet (hoping that he never attends). I didn't think that this was a bad film- it wasn't a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood drecks you see week, but it wasn't that good either. Even though Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"" started to lose its way towards the end, it was more entertaining and ""thought-provoking"" at times than this. I won't even get into the plot since so many other posters already have, and I know I'll be shot down for voicing any more criticism over this ""masterpiece,"" but I hope-- I REALLY, REALLY hope that Christopher Nolan will make another ""Memento"" again.
