0,16 January 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,10, Holds up as a classic.,"Alien remains one of the most original, terrifying movies of all time. Compare this with the lame sci fi horrors we get nowadays, 1979, and it still packs a huge punch.",/
1,11 February 2018,gogoschka-1,10, A Timeless Science Fiction Masterpiece,"'Alien' is one of those special films that have aged very, very well. Even now, after nearly 40 years, everything about it just feels fresh. The restrained, natural performances by the fantastic cast; the outstanding production design; the beautiful, ominous score by Jerry Goldsmith; the realistic, ""lived-in"" look of space-freighter Nostromo's interior: it actually feels less dated than many science fiction films that were made much later, which is quite an astonishing feat. Even the (what now must be considered) ""retro"" technology inside the ship doesn't necessarily have to be viewed as anachronistic in the face of our obvious recent advancements, because it's the most simple technological equipment that is usually robust enough to survive the longest under harsh conditions (like the extreme temperatures in space).

3,20 February 2018,ivo-cobra8,10, One of the best classic sci-fi horror films of all time - A masterpiece,"A masterpiece one of the best classic sci-fi horror films from the 70's I have ever saw and experience. The first time I saw this film was in the 97 when I was 13 years old because this film was so popular that time and even today people talk's about it. Watching the first time this film I must say I loved it. I love this film to death of all the sci-fi films today this one is the best one and beats them all. This is the real science fiction film about ""extraterrestrial life form"" it is interesting, brilliant about time in the space and life form that want's to whip whole humanity out. This is Ridley Scott's masterpiece and one of his best films of all time. Everything about this film is perfect, the script, the actors, puppetry, models, and special effects about Alien design. ",v
4,6 April 2000,zetes,10, The Purina Dog Chow company will expand and make a big mistake!,"Ridely Scott is such a minimalist in Alien that many sci-fi nuts find it slow and unexciting. So many people prefer Aliens, its sequel, to this one. I think Aliens, directed by James Cameron, is another sci-fi masterpiece (and maybe the best action film ever made), but I think Alien is much better. In fact, I would say that it is among the best films ever made, in sci-fi, only second to 2001. ",i

6,4 May 2021,hellholehorror,10, Undeniably stunning,"This was made in the seventies. Seventies. The picture quality is stunning. Undeniably stunning. The sound is perfect except minor issues regarding occasional muffled dialogue. God it looks good. Rivals and beats many films made thirty years later. The blend of suspense, horror, science-fiction is perfect. The budget is perfectly used. Perfect. I say stick with the theatrical version, the various director cuts are not as well paced, add irrelevant scenes and don't fix the one bit that annoys me - the jump cut on Ash's head. Stay theatrical and think of the best film ever made and you would possibly have this. There may be a scant few other films but this would be the first. The ending is so intense and fearful without cheap techniques. I love it. Very minor technical issues are forgotten through fear, fascination and legacy.",w
7,15 April 2004,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,10, Classic tale of terror,"This is one of the finest science fiction films ever made.

9,23 April 2005,gftbiloxi,10, Iconographic Horror,"ALIEN received mixed reviews when it debuted in 1979--largely from science fiction critics, who accused it of being little more than a sort of Friday the 13th in Outer Space, a blood-and-gore horror flick given a futuristic twist via special effects. But while these accusations have more than a little truth, it has been an incredibly influential film--and even today, in the wake of CGI effects, it still holds up extremely, extremely well.",w

Alien set a standard that has yet to be equaled let alone surpassed. I watched it on the wide screen when it was first released, and over a dozen times since. And even though I know what's coming, the hairs on the back of my neck still stand up. What a brilliant work of theatrical genius.",1
12,6 February 2005,BrandtSponseller,10, A new appreciation of this film's excellence,"Seven members of a space mining cargo ship who are headed back to Earth are awakened from hypersleep when their ship detects a signal from an intelligent civilization on a small, uncharted planet. When they locate the source of the signal, they find more than they bargained for, and all of their lives are endangered.",6
13,14 February 2017,maryolalov,9, The start of a great anthology,Alien has a slow and mysterious beginning. It starts like nothing special - some people eating and talking on a space ship. But it gets more intense when they detect an unknown planet and land on it so they can explore it. The audience has to wait more than 1 hour to see the thing they paid for - the xenomorph. And this waiting makes its emergence one of the greatest moments in the cinematic history. Still we see the xenomorph only 3 or 4 times which is quite disappointing but this makes the alien more mysterious and gives the movie a horror character. And of course another reason we see the xenomorph so rarely is because the CGI wasn't very well developed at that time and it was pretty hard to make the alien's appearance. Alien(1979) is a great start for the Alien anthology and even though the bad CGI it's the best movie in the whole anthology. The movie is worth watching.,5
14,31 July 2004,Anonymous_Maxine,10, Whose idea was it to bring a cat in the first place?,"I'm a little confused as to why there was a cat on board in the first place. Needless to say, given that there was an entire crew on board the Nostromo, a merchant vessel carrying, if I remember correctly, something like 20,000,000 tons of mineral ore, there was hardly a lack of companionship. At any rate, I can easily brush aside my curiosity about the effort that went into designing the life support system that would have been needed to keep the cat alive along with the rest of the humans as they traveled for months on end in deep sleep. It doesn't matter, because the cat was involved in most of the scariest scenes. ",4

17,31 January 2005,Patuquitos,10, The mother of all movies,"Back in early 20th century, Lumi√®re brothers didn't have a clue of what they were playing with. I'm freaking sure that if somebody could have magically told them that thanks to their work, a movie like 'Alien' would have been made in the future, they both would have died of a sudden, shocked by the consequences of their labor, like an honest scientist would if he was shown an evil use of his research.

18,17 April 2009,shortround8391,10, Alien.....the one that started it all........,"Alien....the creature......the film.....the legend. The one that started it all, the one that led to one of the greatest sequels ever made, one that got a comic book mini-series and 2 cross-over films with ""Predator"". This is THE film. And without a doubt, the greatest horror film ever created, and this totally makes ""Halloween"" look like ""Chicken Little"". You can forget about all those rubbish ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies, 'cause ""Alien"" just takes horror up to so many levels! In ""Alien"", we find ourselves in the distant future with a crew just coming back from a haul of 20 million tons of ore back to Earth. But while the crew members are in stasis, their ship picks up an ""SOS"" from a nearby planet, and once the crew is awakened, they are forced by the ""Company"" regulations to follow that signal. And then when they land on the planet and it turns out that something terrifying is in store for them, when a hostile organism attaches itself to one of the crew members. And later on, it becomes clear that the crew member was being impregnated and then dies a horrible, violent death from a deadly breed of an other-worldly life-form. And now the rest of the crew must fight off the creature.",?

20,18 February 2006,nycritic,10," This Ageless, Silent, Haunted House Floating in Silent Space","Before gore, special effects, and the denouement of the alien itself in future sequels, this was the movie that revolutionized the concept of the ""haunted house"" and merged it in a seamless sieve with ""body horror"" and its ultimate intrusion into our own most intimate space.",e
21,26 November 2021,dworldeater,10, Original and terrifying sci fi terror,"Alien is Ridley Scott's masterpiece. This kicked off a mostly excellent franchise and influenced cinema as whole. Designed with great detail by brilliant artist HR Geiger the Alien brings forth a new level of intergalactic terror. Alien is completely different from anything that came before and took sci fi horror to new heights and gave it a lot of depth. The ensemble cast is excellent and is lead by Sigorney Weaver and had Yaphett Kotto, Tom Skerrit and Harry Dean Stanton as strong support. In my opinion this film is flawless and still looks incredible today. The special effects are amazing and the acting and direction is spot on. Alien is incredible and in my opinion is timeless. The film aged well and is essential and a classic.",f
22,15 December 2022,xiaoli7377,10, An All-Time Classic,"""Alien"" is the one of the first films that I think of when I think of the word ""atmosphere."" Ridley Scott brilliantly crafts a setting in this sci-fi horror classic that is still explored with prequels and sequels. It's not just the setting though; it's the way that the plot slowly builds up and there are many moments of downtime to get a little familiar with characters. This film, along with other late 70s classics such as ""Halloween"", really set up the blueprint that most modern horror films replicate.",_

24,12 March 2014,petra_ste,10, I admire its purity,"Less is more in the horror genre. Give us a fight between a giant humanoid albino and an octopus-like creature and we'll think of the special effects guy eating a taco in front of his PC screen as he is rendering the octopus' slime. Show us a maze of dark corridors where a monster may be hiding, and our pulse rate rises. We don't need to be bludgeoned in the head with horrific imagery: glimpsing something creepy out of the corner of the eye is more than enough.",t
25,12 March 2002,exterminator_99,9, The original masterpiece that launched a dynasty,"As the credits of ""Alien"" open, the slowly paced opening titles and soft, eerie score give some indication of what viewers will experience when watching this film.  It starts off so unassumingly that first-time viewers are unlikely to be moved by the story or inspired by the slight character development in the film's first half.  It is in fact this lack of certainty that makes ""Alien"" work so well, for as the film hits it second half it shifts dramatically from slow space road movie to an intergalactic haunted house fright show.  This flip in drama, pace and tension makes for an unnerving ride into the unknown and results in one of the landmark sub-genre-sci-fi movies of the 20th century.",t
26,14 August 1998,Pluto-3,9, Milestone,"The beginning of one of the greatest series of all time. This film will always remain a classic. It's scary, influential and insanely entertaining. Not just that but Ridley Scott actually has a great sense of style and mood and he plays with that a lot, to make us shiver. There's also an interesting mystery surrounding the Alien which we know practically nothing about. Sigourney Weaver is just as powerful as usual and really brings strength to the film; they make one. Last but not least, the musical score. Wow! It's fantastic. I think the Alien series is known for that aspect as well. Let's hope they'll continue the series and dang we need it all on DVD !",_
27,14 August 2022,covington_c,10, Arguably... the BEST!,"This movie gets it right in every way! I remember seeing this at the drive-in, when I was a kid! Most movies don't hold up over time, b/ this one ABSOLUTELY does. Great directing, acting, storyline, plot & casting! Definitely in my top 5 of ALL TIME!

28,1 September 2022,the50xbomb,10, EXTRA(ordinary)-TERR(ifying)-ESTRIAL,"One of the best lit films of all time, the attention and care towards how the sets, actors, and Xenomorph appear in darkness and light is so commendable and is what keeps this film looking so fresh. Alien is basically what happens when a creative team is given the ability to build an immersive world while also making a tense horror movie about an alien killing people on a ship. It has indulgent landing and launching sequences, an infatuation with the anatomy of its creature, accurate specs of its ships layout, it's not a hard sci-fi watch per se but you can tell if Ridley and the crew had more money this film would probably be much longer. As it is I think it has the perfect length, also huge props to that fantastic cast where every character is clear and well motivated. I love this movie so much.",r
29,30 December 2021,owenpont-70803,10, A classic film that everyone should watch...........,I mean what do I need to say? Its a masterpiece of a film. It combines horror and Sci-Fi perfectly. The scene when the alien comes out of the guys chest is gross and amazingly done. Ripley is a great character and she is shown perfectly in the movie as the hero. Overall this movie is just awesome in about every way.,v
30,17 April 2016,sharky_55,9, Crew expendable.,"The opening of Alien recalls another sci-fi masterpiece, 2001 with its slow, labourious long takes that elegantly reveal its world (there's even a deleted Spaceballs-style shot where the gigantic Nostromo rolls over the top of the screen). Scott takes his time to introduce us to little bits of information as we need them - which is why the eventual reveal of Ash as an android is so effective. The assumed knowledge that with space travel comes advanced robotics has us second guessing every move even halfway through the movie. The camera-work is cautious in peering around each dim corner and ledge, as if it was a crew member in itself fearful for its own life. Modern horrors are always rushing to the next gory spectacle, the next money shot. Alien wants to milk every last drop of suspense of the universe's great unknown before it eats you up. ",
31,6 April 2020,KoolCatReviews,10, You know your movie is special when you call it 'alien',"This isn't just an 'alien' film this is the alien film. A film that succeeds in both the horror and Sci-fi genre. Having seen both versions of this film directors and the theatrical, I must tell you to watch this film. The acting cast is great, the story flows and is logical but that's not even the best part. The special effects and CGI have never really been topped by any other film. Even in the newer 'alien' movies or the 'alien vs predator' franshise. Nothing has created true horror in the 'alien' universe such as this. A classic most people would call it, after all it is the alien movie.",
32,28 November 2021,dfloro,9, One of Ridley's best and my favorites,"First, I feel the need to add a disclaimer before recommending everybody, who hasn't already seen it, watch ""Alien."" If you're prone to anxiety attacks, or if thrillers just make you unduly anxious, don't watch this movie all by yourself. It will scare the holy h#!/ out of you, and completely creep you out as well.",
33,16 October 2019,UniqueParticle,10, Monumental 40th anniversary theater experience!,"Captivating development I can't believe I have only seen once before today many years ago! The sound and special effects is so well done, very translucent legendary classic like nothing else. So nice to see all the young actors in their prime. The look of Alien and drool was so perfect; I am so grateful to have been able to experience it on the big screen, sorry if I overly talk about that although I did get my ticket in August so I was ready. One of the greatest films ever made on earth and I am glad I own in 4K, I got that not too long ago.",
34,11 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, Sci-fi classic,"Easily one of Ridley Scott's finest films, and one of the best of the sci-fi genre. Alien is simply wonderful, with imaginative production design especially and a magnificent score from Jerry Goldsmith. The pace is also right on the money with a purposefully slow build-up, the editing is great, Scott's direction is superb and the story is wonderfully structured with seldom a dull moment. The script is also thought-provoking, clever and well written, while the atmosphere is just spellbinding with a perfect mixture of false scares and genuine jolts. The acting is also top notch, Sigourney Weaver is amazing as Ellen Ripley, who is not only one of the most iconic characters in film history but a contender for Weaver's best ever role. It is a delight seeing fine underrated actor John Hurt, and he is great to watch as the curious crewman. Overall, defines the term sci-fi classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
35,17 March 2015,Leofwine_draca,10, A masterclass in sci-fi horror filmmaking,"There's no doubt that ALIEN is a classic of the science fiction genre. It's a film that came along at just the right time, proving to be an antidote to the kind of kiddie-friendly sci-fi that was popularised by STAR WARS during the period. While this first film in the long-running series has since been overshadowed by a superior sequel (Jim Cameron's ALIENS, one of the best sci fi/horror/action films ever) and a third film that nearly equalled the highs found here, it's nevertheless a hugely entertaining movie that works thanks to a simple, straightforward plot line that offers maximum terror, all of the time.",
36,23 December 2022,boardertrash,10," For me, it doesn't get any better than this","I'm often amazed that people prefer Aliens to the original, I guess it's down to personal taste but in my opinion the first film is far and away the best. It's the way Ripley's whole world just unravels gradually from the get go, the pacing is sublime and it simply doesn't have to rely on tons of action set pieces like the second film does. My assumption is some people find it too slow but everytime I watch it I just marvel at every scene, the effort that went into every detail. The true mark of what an achievement this film was for the time is also how nothing appears dated even now in HD or in 4k, there are countless instances in the second film where it's blatantly obvious scale models have been used and it always bugs me. You have to remember this was made when Christopher Reeve's Superman was about which vfx's look terrible in comparison, blows your mind doesn't it?! Don't get me wrong I enjoy all of the Alien franchise movies, they do gradually worsen in sequence apart from Prometheus which is joint second place for me. I won't go into script or acting, needless to say both are top drawer and feel completely authentic and natural.",
37,22 March 2019,Darkside-Reviewer,10, Mother I've turned the rating system back on,I decided to finally review Alien after watching it on Blu Ray I have seen it many times before and it still blew me away seeing a movie now forty years old still looking better than most modern movies Alien is a classic atmospheric movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish the beautiful direction and camera shots make the movie look incredible even today if you haven't already seen this classic I recommend watching it on Blu Ray and enjoying a classic at its finest.,
38,16 March 2019,acedj,10, The one that started it all.,"This is a masterpiece. From the long, detailed shots of both interior and exterior of the ship, to the fleeting glimpses of the alien, this is cinematography at it's best. The movie is paced slow, in order to build tension, and it was the right decision. Alien paved the way for a whole new genre of movie, scifi horror. Ridley Scott birthed an instant classic, and unfortunately has not been able to repeat such a marvel.",

40,20 April 2016,PredragReviews,9, Sci-Fi/Horror Masterpiece!,"""Alien"" is one of the most intense Sci-Fi thrillers to have ever graced the silver screen or the home theater in any format! It is the film's intensity that provides such an incredible draw to this extraordinary film. I was pulled in by the ultra high sense of realism. This film almost feels like a documentary because of a lot of the subtle hand-held camera work (read; not like the shaky, seizure inducing hand-held work of today's films). There's much going on in that film that was revolutionary for the time. Great ideas, design, cinematography, subtle, very realistic performances.",
41,8 November 2022,ForTheMostPart1999,9," Cleverly frightful, even after seeing it for the first time at this time of age","Alien is a well done, out-of-this-world horror film that leaves some good scares and some epic scenes. The alien itself was splendidly creepy, the humanoid was really neat, and the spaceship was awesome. Most of the main characters were not all that compelling, but with a story like this, it all mixes together nicely. This also included some well designed special effects, including the alien, and especially the cargo ship that carried the crew (and the cat). I can certainly see why this was a big hit during it's time, and as mentioned before, I would have to say that it still is a really good hit today.",

43,24 June 2019,truemythmedia,10, Nigh Perfect Sci-Fi Horror Flick,"The settings in this film are exhilarating and claustrophobic, the characters are funny and likeable and we want them to survive, the creature is horrifying and vile, and the storyline is tense and exciting. This might be the most popular alien franchise ever made (there are more sequels for this than there are for ""Predator""), and that's a well-deserved title. Personally, this is in my top ten science fiction films (and maybe in my top ten horror films as well); it's a movie I'll return to multiple times over the course of my life, and its one I doubt I'll ever grow tired.

Even tho it shows its age --computers, technology, props and costumes- it grabs you like a hook in your belly from the start. Young Sigurney Weaver and Veronica Cartwright provide a high breeze of fresh air in the otherwise oppressive mouldy interiors. It was Ridley Scott at his best, along with other early masterpieces like his much accoladed debut 'The Duellists'. It is one of those films that set landmarks and that you don't tire of watching time and again.

46,24 June 2022,nickenchuggets,10, Terror in space,"Every so often, a movie so influential is released that it changes an entire genre. While it might look a little dated by today's standards, I would still say Alien falls into this category. Even after 50 years, I've seen few movies that manage to make you feel as alone and helpless as this one. This has a lot to do with the setting, which is probably the best thing about the film. Space is full of wonders and exotic sights, some of which haven't even been discovered yet, but it can also be your worst nightmare, especially for those that are claustrophobic. This is because almost this entire movie takes place on a spaceship so far away from Earth that it would take months to get back to the planet. The spaceship in question is the USCSS Nostromo, which is attached to a large ore refinery. The ship is run by an advanced artificial intelligence with female programming, known as Mother. The crew of the ship consists of a measly 7 people, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Kane (John Hurt), Captain Dallas, Parker, Lambert, Ash and Brett. They've been awakened from a type of suspended animation procedure designed to preserve a person's lifespan on unimaginably long space journeys because the ship has detected something on a local moon. The unknown signal appears as a pulse on the radar screen that blinks every 12 seconds, and the crew has no idea what it is. Ripley has a bad feeling about what the signal could be and suggests they leave it alone and get out of there. However, the Nostromo's parent company dictates that any unknown signal has to be investigated. The ship uncouples itself from the refinery and begins to land on the moon. Once there, 3 crew members, including Kane, venture outside the ship in order to find the source of the signal, and find out it's originating from a huge, crashed alien craft shaped like a wishbone. Once inside, the 3 crewmembers discover a massive, circular command center which has the fossilized remains of the ship's pilot sitting on a chair. More concerning is the fact that the body has a large gouge in its chest, like something exploded from inside it. Upon going deeper into the ship, Kane comes across what looks to be a cargo hold containing dozens of round, leathery objects, each about 2 feet tall. Not knowing what they are, he tries to investigate one, when a creature resembling a horseshoe crab with tentacles grabs onto his face. Some time after, the remaining crewmembers carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo, and even though it seems like a cruel thing to do, Ripley refuses them entry, worried about the potentially deadly thing attached to him. However, Dallas outranks Ripley and overturns her decision. Once Kane is onboard again, Ash, the ship's scientist, and Dallas set about trying to remove the strange lifeform from his face. They try cutting it, but it bleeds corrosive liquid that burns through several layers of the ship's hull. They also find out it inserted something down his throat and is supplying him oxygen, so removing it forcefully might kill him. Eventually, it dies and falls off on its own, and Kane appears to be alright, despite having no memory of what happened to him. After a while though, the crew's mealtime is interrupted when Kane suffers a horribly gory death by having a juvenile alien tear itself through his midsection. As it turns out, the creature attached to him implanted the egg of an alien into his body, and now it's prowling around the ship somewhere. The crewmembers try different ways of killing it, including electric pikes and flamethrowers. The alien effortlessly kills any person trying to track it down, and not much time passes before it's bigger than a human. After Brett and Dallas are killed trying to look for it, someone suggests abandoning the ship, but the Nostromo's shuttle is too small to ferry the 4 survivors. Later on, Ripley finds out via Mother that Ash actually admires the alien as the ""perfect lifeform"" and his goal is to make sure no harm comes to it. Ash's cover is blown, and after trying to kill Ripley, he is decapitated and shown to be a robot. Ash's disembodied head tells the survivors that his true mission was always the safekeeping of the creature, and he doesn't care if the rest of the crew dies. Ash's body is destroyed with a flamethrower, and the remaining 3 decide it's time to blow up the ship. Ripley tells Lambert and Parker to get as much coolant as possible, but the alien sneaks up on them and kills them both. Meanwhile, Ripley initiates the ship's self destruct countdown, and after a certain amount of time has passed, there's no aborting it. Now completely alone, she manages to get to the shuttle about 20 seconds before the Nostromo blows up. It looks like she's finally won, but the alien has actually snuck onto the shuttle with her. After hiding from it for what seems like an eternity, she shoots it into the airlock after opening it, and the shuttle's exhaust disintegrates it. Finally, Ripley is able to safely return to cryosleep for the long journey to earth. This is without a doubt one of the most well known horror movies ever, and it's easy to see why. There's, of course, many reasons to praise Alien for, and alien is the keyword here. The movie features a lot of creepy and otherworldly visual design courtesy of HR Giger, who also designed the appearance of the title character. Nothing else in sci-fi looks like it, and this art style is present all through the movie, including the architecture of the crashed ship. One of Alien's core advantages is how well the movie is able to create tension. There's many moments throughout where you sense something bad will happen, and something suddenly appears, but it's not the alien. Once the feeling of relief comes over you, that's when it strikes. Obviously I can't talk about suspense without mentioning the movie's stellar soundtrack. It does what it's supposed to do, and makes those moments of anticipation all that much creepier. Still, I think the best thing about this movie is simply the fact that it takes place in a disturbing environment. It's similar to Jaws but with a space setting, and creates a feeling of unease knowing you're lightyears away from humanity and nobody can hear you. It's not like this is an original opinion, but I think Alien has definitely earned its place as one of horror's all time best, due to its setting, relatable characters, unforgettable art design, music, and countless other things.",
47,9 June 2019,vithiet,9, Classic movie that defined the space sci-fi horror genre,"I've seen this movie many times before but just watched the Director's Cut for the first time. Besides a couple of scenes with very dated special effects, it has aged very well and remains a classic that set up all the rules for this type of movie. Younger generations may think it's a bunch of predictable, overused tropes but they should keep in mind this is the movie that inspired everything else they might have seen!
Having watched the original Blade Runner recently to prepare for Blade Runner 2049, it's also interesting to notice how much of the atmosphere and gritty elements/shots in Alien help mold what would become another genre-defining movie for Ridley Scott.",

So, I re-watched Alien, trying to see if I could see where this poster was coming from. I guess there are now two types of viewers. The first - like me - grew up on Alien in the late seventies/early eighties, where it was one of the most ahead of its time films ever made. It started off the whole 'monster-munching' movie genre, where a lone creature stalks and eliminates a team/crew/whatever one by one. There have been countless B-movies made since its release in 1979 which have tried - unsuccessfully - recapture its look, feel and financial viability, but pretty much all have failed.",
49,28 January 2009,classicsoncall,9," ""What's the story Mother?""","For me, ""Alien"" was one of the seminal films of the Seventies that had a way of reinventing a genre, much in the way ""Star Wars"" did for sci-fi fantasy or ""The Exorcist"" did for horror. Sci-fi horror was treated to something new and different here, with scenes and concepts that were truly unique that hadn't been done before. I still think back to the time I saw the picture during it's original theatrical release, and marvel at the idea of the chest-burster for example. And I can't tell you how much the scene with Ash (Ian Holm) that revealed his robotic form blew me completely away; it was almost too difficult to concentrate on the rest of the story. Then there was the title character itself, a creature assuming horrific proportions through the same process of metamorphosis that transforms caterpillars into butterflies, but here done with complete disregard for the norms of natural evolutionary process.",

Awakened from hypersleep, the crew are obligated to land on the alien world where the call for help has originated, but the ship is slightly damaged during the landing process and three of the crew set out to explore the hostile new world. They come upon a derelict spacecraft, the skeletonized remains of an alien creature with an odd wound in its chest and a cache of strange egg-like objects. Crew member Kane is brought back from the exploration unconscious and with a bizarre, crab-like creature attached to his face. He is still alive, and indeed, the creature on his face seems to be keeping him alive for reasons unknown. The Nostromo is repaired and the crew leave the desolate planet behind. The crab creature soon leaves its perch on Kane's face and dies, and Kane emerges from his coma, apparently in good health. But the purpose of the alien soon becomes terribly clear; Kane has been impregnated with an alien embryo which births itself from his chest in a shower of blood and gore, killing Kane and escaping into the ships air ducts before anyone can react. The crew set out to destroy the creature, not realizing immediately that its accelerated growth has transformed it into a huge and vicious predator whose only desire is to kill them all.",

Ridley Scott was a master of suspense in that film, and it is also very uncomfortable in 2022. The crew facing this creature alone in space is a simple but very effective film. I love the fact that Ripley is just another character in the film and that she is forced to play the lead role when people are killed. Not heroin. Heroine, full stop. The fact that Ellen Ripley is a woman doesn't affect her level of badassery at all, although it does affect her character in ways that make her far more interesting than any other cinematic hero.

I think the one reason this movie doesn't strike any special chord with me is that it feels slow to start with, and some of the actual scenes of the aliens itself haven't aged perfectly (it's obvious that it's someone in a suit, though not as bad as some of the 50s/60s creature features).

These people were blue collar workers; not the brilliant scientists and doctors that you see in today's movies regarding aliens. No, what you see in 1979 is much more realistic of how humans would be when encountering a complete unknown. In movies like Prometheus and Life, the overall common sense is nil and the smarmy, charming and very attractive geniuses are completely opposite of what brilliant people of science and medicine are really like. In reality, they are mostly awkward, quiet, strange and in many times extremely plain in appearance. In Alien, everyone comes across as tired, annoyed, curious (Kane) and finally terrified.

And though the scenes of her in her panties were anti-feminist, she still was the lone survivor, who kicked the Alien out of the airlock. She kicked a-- and everyone will always remember that, especially James Cameron. And what about Tom Skerritt? As captain, he always left the science decision to Ash, as he was instructed to do by the company. He felt he was, ""just the captain,"" though he did ignore basic contamination protocols by letting Caine in with the Alien attached to his face. His acting was perfect, a man who only knows the job he is hired for, compartmentalized, weak, and yet ultimately courageous in his decision to go after the Alien. And Parker and Brett were perfect. Pay attention to how their camaraderie is condensed into a few beautiful scenes. Ridley Scott should be credited for this, as we really get to know the friendship between them quite quickly (as James Cameron does in Aliens). Lambert is great in her nervousness.

Tom Skerritt as the captain does little to inspire confidence, and the only person who knows what she's doing is Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who ironically becomes the only survivor, launching Sigourney Weaver's career as a star and becoming the first female action hero in film history (unless one counts Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz."")

106,19 June 2015,anaconda-40658,9, Something Out There.,"Alien (1979): Dir: Ridley Scott / Cast: Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, John Hurt, Veronica Cartwright: Terrifying science fiction thriller about a threat that isn't fully comprehended. Seven astronauts undergo a mission in space and come across pods. John Hurt is found unconscious with a strange creature entwined on his face. Examination indicates that its blood is a burning acid. Hurt regains consciousness leading to the famous scene where a slender creature bursts out through his chest. It is a battle for survival as it grows rapidly and outwits the crew who do everything at their disposal to terminate the creature. Truly shocking and director Ridley Scott plays on its claustrophobic feel. The cast are a small group of character actors who succeed in giving realistic emotion to the shock effect. They all awaken from hyper sleep unaware that only one will return. Sigourney Weaver plays off guts and brains as the heroine Ripley whose fight for survival is strong stuff. Ian Holm is compelling as Ash who carries a secret of his own. Tom Skerritt as the captain is at a loss but ultimately makes a brave attempt to flame out the creature. Then there is Hurt in the film's gruesome classic scene that still remains tense. This is a great cast of character actors whose roles benefit from their appeal. Triumphant production with questions regarding the ominous unknown. Score: 9 / 10",

The crew is on a long haul mining mssion to a distant part of space and on their return in hibernation they are awakened by the computer ""Mother"" to answer a distress call from a planet. They land there and encounter an alien ship and what appear to be eggs. One of the crew is attacked by the embryo in the egg and is taken back to the ship. The alien develops into a huge beast and the film is driven by the creature hunting the crew one by one. The fact that the alien has acid for blood doesn't help either. One of the crew is actually a robot that ends up protecting the creature that the rest of the crew is trying to destroy. The level of anticpation, fear and shock value is there in spades. A classic movie which should be in the scifi hall of fame.",

The only character I felt any sympathy with was Kane and that`s only because he was played by the excellent John Hurt . As for the rest of the crew I couldn`t care less if they got eaten or not . To all intents ALIEN is a corny B movie script ( I think we can ignore all the pseudo-intellectual claptrap involving subtext - it`s a B movie script ) produced by A list technicians ",

Thirty years, and the movie is still as fresh, brilliant and scary as it was back in 1979, perhaps because no other film (with the exception of James Cameron's superb sequel, Aliens) has yet been able to match its claustrophobic mood and moments of sheer, unadulterated dread.",

These people are on a salvage mission, trying to bring things back to sell. They have been victimized by their own bosses. When they go down to the planet, they have not been told what lies there. There is a darkness to everything. It isn't the romantic explorer thing of a Star Trek or the use of a sophisticated starship. This is a big space barge. When the man is brought back from the surface with that thing on his face, we know that there is something coming. The scene following is one of the most startling and disgusting I've ever seen (in a positive way). The alien is a true threat, dripping corrosive venom and poison blood, terrorizing the ship, leaving one person to combat it. If there is a more claustrophobic, terrifying movie than this, I'd like to know what it is.

To say that this film changed my life may be a slight overstatement but it certainly changed the way I view Film and Cinema! The opening titles (accompanied by Jerry Goldsmith's thoroughly creepy score) give the tone of what is to come. The crew of a commercial star freighter are awakened by their onboard computer as it has picked up a 'signal' from a small planetoid in a nearby system. Obliged by Company Rules to investigate, they set down and find a completely non-human ship crashed and (apparently) derelict. One of the crew descends into the bowels of the ship - to be confronted by a chamber full of ovoid shapes...unwisely he decides to take a closer look...and things spiral out of control from that point....What makes this Film SO great is that it is almost shot in a semi-documentary style - the shaky camera footage on the helmet cams, the dark foreboding atmosphere and the quite slow pace - all are deliberately and slowly drawing the audience in. Alien sometimes comes close to being a 'Science Fiction Art-Film' - and so it is - in a way. The designs are extraordinary - with Swiss Artist H.R. Giger designing the absolutely frightening ALIEN of the title. Scott's visuals are astounding and introduced him to Hollywood as a real talent. The pace picks up through the second half of the film - the effects were all done 'in camera' - no CGI here - just old fashioned film making. Scott ensures you never quite see the creature, which adds to the menace and sense that you are trapped in there with it. The sequence in the air shafts is superb - a gripping piece of cinema, as is Alien's most celebrated scene - the 'birth' of the monster.",

125,19 June 2012,estebangonzalez10,10, The Mother of All Horror Films,"¬®It's got a wonderful defense mechanism. You don't dare kill it.¬® Ridley Scott has had a great career and made several great films, but Alien, only his second film, may arguably be his best one. In my opinion this is the best horror film of all time due to the dark mood, the claustrophobic atmosphere, and several shocking scenes that continue to have an impact on the horror genre 33 years after its release. I have to admit that I just now got around watching this historic movie after having seen its prequel, Prometheus. I liked Prometheus so much that I knew I had to go back and watch the original film that got the franchise started. Despite having seen the aliens in the horrific AVP films, I still was shocked and surprised with the scenes and effects in Alien. The visual effects were excellent and it rightfully won an Oscar in that department. I can only imagine how shocking the chest bursting scene must have been for viewers in the late 70's. The scene was masterfully directed by Ridley Scott and it has to be one of the most frightening ones in horror history. It may be the highlight of the movie, but there are also several other shocking moments that make this the perfect sci-fi horror film. I loved the way they managed to build the suspense without showing too much of the alien. The setting was just perfect and the sense of claustrophobia is all over the movie. You knew that at any moment the alien could pop out of nowhere and attack once again. That sense of dread was also built thanks to the suspenseful score. Thousands of horror films have tried to copy a similar format since the release of this perfect movie without reaching the same success.",

I thought the film was one of the most excruciatingly dull I've ever seen. It just dragged on and on, with even the violent scenes were the alien attacks being completely uninteresting because you see nothing that happens. It's just some blurs, some terrible acting, a closeup of the mouth and it's over. The characters were total clich√©s and completely uninteresting ones at that. I didn't care once about what was going to happen to them. I was just praying they all died and the film ended an hour before it was supposed to. The film wasn't remotely suspenseful or engaging. A lot of scenes were unintentionally laughable because of how absurd they were (like the one in the picture above) or because of how contrived and idiotic they were (like Ash being a robot). As much as I want to give this film a below average rating though, there's no denying that it's technical aspects are phenomenal. The art direction and makeup completely revolutionized science-fiction and the cinematography is ingenious. But when all is said and done I was just bored to tears and extremely disappointed.",

The movie just seemed too dated, and I don't mean with the special effects, cinematography or anything like that. It's just that this film just didn't add any surprises, even when the audience comes across a certain twist it doesn't add anything to the movie that will add any shock value, the film just felt a bit dull and sort of boring. I can see how this movie would have impressed a lot of people who first viewed it when it came out. But watching a movie that came out when I wasn't even born, it just fell short of my expectation. This film is far from being a bad movie, it was actually good but I just felt that it was a bit overrated. The title of the movie is ""Alien"", but the audience don't even get to see the alien all that much, well besides that there is little to no tension and most of the scenes are just a group of truckers in space that decides to go investigating in till they come across a unpleasant discovery and investigate some more, but none of it was intense or gripping. Although there are very few scenes of the actual alien, I get the feeling that they went that direction to add more fright, but didn't really work for me. A lot of the scenes were about the crew trying to find out what the alien is capable of. The movie also goes in a direction where you just don't care for the crew that is trying to survive. It was probably a phenomenal movie of it's time and did a lot for the sci-fi horror genre, but I ain't going to jump on the bandwagon and say this movie is the best in the genre.",

An abnormal giant creature is terrorizing a bunch of innocent humans, and even the introduction to each monster is eerily similar. I really dig the influences that Jaws made on Alien. I liked how they hid the alien until the end, where we finally get to see him in all his grotesque glory. The 1970's was a hard time for sci-fi. Not many science fiction movies were made in the midst of American exploitation films, but luckily Star Wars and Close Encounters changed everything. Because of the success of those films, one of the best sci-fi/horror classics of the twentieth century was able to get produced. I am not much of a horror guy but if you are able to add a science-fiction element to the horror and actually make it good, well you can count me in.

I was just turning 18 that year so yes I went on my own accord. Eventually, when VCRs, DVDs, Blu-Rays came out I owned it ineasch version, and it was worth it. Ridley Scott raised and set the bar very hi for any subsequent Sci-fi movies to come out after it. Any other Sci-fi flick I saw after this one was, 'How didi it compare toAlien?"". This Is one of those movies that no matter how many times you see it, viewing it remains worthy while. Sigorney Weaver set the bar for female leads too. After her performance, female leads as badasses became not so uncommon. I loved the movie so much I even looked up how the creature was designed and learned the H. R. Giger was the primary influence on what the creature looks like. Several more Ridley Scott films fell into my favorite list too. This film is so good that I can count on one hand how many I have given a '10' rating to. I personally think that 'Aliens' is just good, but takes a different approach to compete storyline.

142,18 November 2007,Woodyanders,10, Why this landmark sci-fi/horror classic still works,"There are several reasons why this remarkably taut, scary and effective science fiction/horror hybrid holds up so well to this very day. 1.) The premise ingeniously mixes elements from two separate, yet compatible genres into a strong and satisfying synthesis. The futuristic outer space setting is pure sci-fi, but the grotesque monster, ghastly gore and spooky mood are sheer gut-wrenching horror all the way. 2.) The plausibly drab and bleak depiction of a frightfully possible future. There's nothing slick or shiny about the future shown in this picture. It's truly grim and grimy, with the grungy set design, grubby costumes and rundown looking spaceship all contributing to one fascinatingly credible version of a future that seems just around the corner. The all-powerful company's cold assessment of the crew as expendable isn't too far removed from the world we currently live in -- a world in which greed and money take precedent over the basic worth ascribed to everyday human life. 3.) The gradual pace. While there are some folks who take issue with the methodically slow pace, said pace nonetheless is crucial to developing the almost unbearably substantial amount of suspense that really kicks into harrowing overdrive once the creature gets lose on the ship. It's the meticulous build-up of the first half which gives the second half of the film its considerable nerve-wracking impact and potency. 4.) The infamous ""chest-burster"" scene. It's so supremely well-timed and staged, with highly believable mixed reactions from everyone involved in the scene. ",
143,29 May 2011,anders-rock,10," Creepy, well made and haunting",Every second of this movie gives me the shivers. Even in the slow moving first half the atmosphere is so ominous and creepy and the acting so excellent that I'm never bored. The movie builds up the tension so masterfully you're on the edge of your seat all the time. I've heard some people say that the effects are dated to which I will answer: No not really. The monster is a man in a suit with some mechanics in the head and while there are a few shots where it's movements seem a little stiff we rarely see it and when we do it's only for a short duration and it actually in many ways looks more real than most CGI creatures of today. The artwork and design is one of the reasons this movie holds up so well to me. The ship looks appropriately old and battered up and the alien itself is pure genius. This movie just keeps thrilling me every time I watch it.,

147,5 June 2016,saymaraza,9, Alien review,"Alien is one of the first movies directed by legendary 'Ridley Scott' (Blade Runner, Gladiator) The film is a classic in the making. When i first heard about this movie i was around 10 years old, obviously too young to watch the movie, now i am 17 and i have watched it for the first time, now twice i enjoyed it so much. This is honestly one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the 70s, probably is my favourite Sci Fi movie of the 70s, and one of the best of all time. The Sequel 'Aliens' (1986) was directed by James Cameron, another one of my favourite directors. Director of 'The Terminator' (1984) which stands as my favourite Sci-Fi movie of all time. The reason i didn't want to see Alien when i was younger, was because i always felt scared of the Alien, i used to have horrific nightmares of them just thinking about them. When i went to Disney world, i have always loved Movies, so i decided to visit a Movie ride, the Alien suddenly popped out of the ceiling, of course it was only plastic, but looked real enough. So i had always been too scared to watch the Movie. I didn't know what i was missing out! As i watched it i didn't know what i was worrying about. It's very different to watching it on Screen than seeing for real. I am nearly 18 now, so i am not really scared of anything anymore, i would definitely go back to Disney and try out that ride again, just to see if it still scares me, I think now i've finally seen the movie i appreciate now that it's not real, and i find it interesting than scary now more than anything, because it feels like I'm in the movie. When it comes to Ridley Scott director 'Prometheus' (2012) a prequel to Alien, that wasn't very scary at all, it was more of a mystery than a Sci-Fi/ Horror i thought. Alien is deifinitely a classic in the making, Don't miss Ridley Scott's masterpiece Alien!",
148,19 February 2018,elijahbutler-40119,10, One of the GREATEST movies of all time!,"I remember when I first saw Alien as a teenager. This movie scared me to the core and it's STILL scary and very suspenseful to this very day! I love movies from all genres and horror is one of my favorite genres in cinema history and when it comes to horror movies, Alien is DEFINITELY one of the greatest ones of all time! Ridley Scott's direction in Alien has a HIGHLY suspenseful feel throughout the entire film and it somewhat makes you feel disturbed and uncomfortable and that's one of the reasons why this film is so iconic! Sigourney Weaver as Ripley takes this ENTIRE film from opening to finish! She was EXCELLENT in this film and this is definitely one of the greatest roles I've seen in ANY movie which makes this one of the greatest roles in cinema history! All of the other characters such as Brett, Parker, Kane, Dallas, Ash and Lambert played by Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto, John Hurt, Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, and Veronica Cartwright were really interesting and engaging characters throughout the entire run time of the film and the acting in Alien is ABSOLUTELY mind-blowing which was another reason on why this movie is insanely scary! Now let's talk about the creature in Alien known as The Xenomorph, this thing is just.................ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING AND AWESOME! The Xenomorph has to be one of the scariest things I've ever seen in ANY movie in my entire life! Ridley Scott also decided to not show this creature for the majority of the film which was a little more terrifying, because you never really expect or know when this thing is going to come or what it's going to do to the crew or what the creature looks like when you first watch Alien and it is just GENIUS AND FANTASTIC SUSPENSE FILM-MAKING! Something else that I also love about Alien is of course the iconic chest burst scene! Most of you who have seen Alien know what I'm talking about, but when they were shooting the chest burst scene, the actors were 100% unaware of what was going to come out of John Hurt's chest so when the Xenomorph burst out of his chest, their reactions were legit and real and that's just so awesome! This movie also holds one of the GREATEST jumpscares in cinema history when Dallas is in the air shafts and out of NOWHERE he runs into the Xenomorph and you don't actually see him die by it, but you see it appear and you just hear this EXTREMELY LOUD screeching sound and static sounds in the background and every time I watch this movie, that jumpscare STILL sends chills down my spine and it's a jumpscare done right! There's also something else I absolutely love about Alien when the crew finds out that Ash was a robot that was sent by the company to send this life form back to earth and it is a VERY clever twist that was HIGHLY unexpected and it's all done by the genius mind of Scott and the tension he brings in this film! Alien is one of my all time favorite movies and it has stood the test of time VERY SUCCESSFULLY and it has inspired many film-makers and it will continue to do that, because it's a timeless masterpiece and a classic film and Alien DEFINITELY gets a 10/10!",

151,11 August 2015,Cinemaniac1984,9, Alien has stood the test of time as a science fiction/horror classic.,"In 1979, Alien was released and was a box office hit thanks to Ridley Scott's brilliant direction and a small cast including a little known actress named Sigourney Weaver who would establish herself as one of the most successful actresses in Hollywood. The story is kept simple and there are plenty of non-stop nail biting moments that would be guaranteed to keep audiences on edge and to scare them out of their seats. Alien certainly lives up to its now famous tagline ""In space no one can hear you scream"". The original movie poster is brilliantly kept simple too.",

In Alien everything works to best effect, and that was not simply luck. In Giger's astonishing alien, cold metallic smoothness is synergised with unmitigated, super-swift killing and intelligent cunning, representing an unprecedentedly fearsome enemy. The bickering relationships among the crew set up an atmosphere of unease and vulnerability that the malign intent of the Company readily exploits. And the descent into chaos and terror is orchestrated with devilish finesse through the brilliant coordination of lighting, music and adroit camera work. For me this is Scott's Citizen Kane - it all falls into place. It is his main claim to greatness.",

I must first say that much of this adoration comes from the beautifully sinister score by Mr. Goldsmith, and, as I very recently learned, a piece from ""Romance"" by Howard Hanson. This became Ripley's theme of defeating the Alien at the end of the film. But I also love Sigourney Weaver, who will always be Ripley. If they dare to remake this film, I won't go see it. We need to learn to quit ""needing"" to remake everything and accept the classics as they are, products of their time. I am sick to death of CGI. ",
156,24 October 2006,charchuk,10, Classic horror,"Probably the first sci-fi/horror, and definitely the best. By limiting the number of characters, and enclosing them in a confined space, Scott hikes up the tension without having to resort to cheap thrills or buckets of gore (though the chest-bursting scene is still terrifyingly effective). Each of the characters is fairly well developed, and it's unclear at the start who will live and who will not, which also upps the suspense. The production design is really cool, and doesn't look dated at all, and the alien creature itself is quite original and still scary. Great performances too, and a good script, making this much more than just a monster flick.",

From the timeless effects, to the fantastic score, to the perfect use of suspense, this film just completely gripped me and never let go from start to finish. The use of atmosphere is probably my favourite element. There were so many scenes where more or less nothing happened that I was still on the edge of my seat throughout. The performances were great, particularly the badass Sigourney Weaver, and the creature design was surprisingly good for a film made in 1979. The story is simple, but it means that it can be fleshed out further, and leads for some great moments of suspense. Oh yeah, and the chestburster scene was just incredible to watch. My one issue is the reveal that Ash is literally a robot? It came completely out of left field and just felt weirdly unnecessary to me.

Sigourney Weaver and the cast do a remarkable job. Alien feels authentic realistic that this could happen in the near future with space travel. It builds great suspense and you dont know when the Alien will show up. The movie has several good surprises. Also many great scenes (especially since it was part of the recent defunct WDW ride).

They chitchat about this and that; they eat; they smoke; they look at outdated computer screens; they emit petty frustrations. Finally, after interminable plot filler, and after our space voyagers have displayed requisite incompetence (what would film stories be without incompetence?), ET shows up on-board, less cosmic than sleazy, like something the cat drug in from a b-grade horror flick. Now, our beleaguered ... and incompetent ... crew promptly sets forth to deal with the menace.",

The acting holds up wonderfully and everyone does an absolutely amazing job, the cinematography was beautiful even by todays standards and the sound design and music was scary, but beautiful and really helped build a certain atmosphere and a sense of complete isolation, which is where the movie shines.

169,21 April 2008,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," I remain underwhelmed, I'm afraid","This film is quite popular, at least judging from it's rating(as I'm writing this, it's placed #50 on the top 250 list). I realize that this was probably a benchmark for special effects when it was made, but now the effects seem incredibly dated(which they don't, at the very least to the same extent, in pieces from the same period, best example being Star Wars), and many scenes seem clich√©d today, even though I suppose they were fresh when it was made. I guess the main problem with the thing is that it doesn't age well, but I also think it lacks too much in both character development and humor... just a little comic relief would have made the nearly two hours go by so much easier(for me, this merely gets slower and less watchable with each repeated viewing). Attempts at making you laugh fall flat on their faces. There are far more unintentional laughs to be had, at various corny and odd things(why does this have so much weird stuff in it, and why do the people who love it just accept that?). More often than not, to me(and one person I know who *loves* these movies), this just ends up being too hard to take seriously. I'm willing to entertain the theory that Ridley Scott's stuff just isn't for me, I've yet to be amazed by him. For how much sheer, unsynthesized acting talent this has, the players have next to nothing to work with(they do turn in fine performances). Nonetheless, the film does manage to scare me and provide some shocks, even though I've seen this and the other films at least three times before. The film manages to establish a pretty nicely done, spooky atmosphere that lasts for most of the film, despite its shortcomings and the very formulaic ending. The plot isn't bad, and it takes off almost immediately, keeping you fairly interested. The characters are so-so, though there aren't any really startlingly poorly written ones. The creature effects are decent enough, and they do not fail to impress at least a little. The editing has moments that are just strange, the cinematography has reasonably little to offer. Props to whoever ensured that the realism was kept at such a high level. The sets, and in general the production design, is all well-done(some is nothing short of breathtaking). I've read one suggestion that stories set where this is and similar are more straining on the audience, and they are more likely to be bored, in spite of the potential talent possessed by those who put it together... I'm inclined to agree. There is some language, and violence as well as gore is also featured herein. I have to admit, I see this as valuable more as an introduction to the world of the title creature, and find, for example, Cameron's expansion of, and further adventure within, it considerably more worthwhile. Don't expect a masterpiece, and prepare to test your patience, especially if you've seen many of these films. The ""Director's Cut""(though he feels the original fits that bill better... hey, at least it's not as bad as the alternate name, ""Extended Version"", which is even a misnomer as it *shortens* the overall length) adds a few things, which you may find worth a look, if you like it(not that there are that many, I count five chapters with additions in the DVD's own breakdown). The commentary track is an OK enough listen, some of the stuff said is cool to hear. I recommend it to fans of alien-type science fiction, and fans of sci-fi horror films(as such, it's good enough) in general. I suggest any possible Alien-fans to-be to start with this film, rather than any of the other films. The series works best in correct order. 7/10",

It combined the science fiction of Star Wars with the relentless killer monster of Jaws and put them into a narrative that reflected the cynical anti-corporate feel of many 70's movies.

186,31 July 2017,Horst_In_Translation,6," A good film, but maybe a bit overrated","Here we have the 1979 two-hour film Alien and this one is the beginning of a franchise that is still going on today, again with Ridley Scott in charge, the man who also directed this original movie. It is all about what happens when an alien creature ends up on a spaceship full of scientists in the future. Lets just say that it is not full of scientists anymore at the end. The movie won an Oscar for its special effects and scored another nomination. These days, despite being almost 40 years old (or because of?), it is considered a classic when it comes to combining the horror and sci-fi genres. The most known cast member is certainly lead actress Sigourney Weaver and she keeps moving more and more into the center of it all the longer the film goes and there are other pretty well-known actors in the relatively small cast here. Still, this is at no point an actors' movie. It is all about the creature, the fight for survival and of course the technical aspects (both visually and audibly). And last but not least about the scare factor: I think they did a pretty good job here in elevating this film beyond mediocre jump scares as the creature attacks sometimes when you don't expect it and does nothing when you do expect it like when the second victim was looking up at the ceiling in search of his cat.",

The man in a costume, cheesy must-have in all kinds of sci-fi and horror flicks of the fifties and sixties, still serves his purpose in this film, which however has the advantage of being masterfully directed.

The acting is perfect in terms of the necessary tension needed for the film and the cast is star studded for the day (albeit Sigourney Weaver was a relative unknown at the time). The beast itself is the ultimate in horror terror and nothing will ever be scarier on screen, especially seeing as though it's all computer generated nowadays, and the fact that you don't see a lot of the beast adds to the tension and fear. The pacing is a bit slow to start with but rips into the action when the face hugger makes it's debut appearance.

They soon pick up a signal from distant planet.Rather than make their way back to Earth, the Nostromo crew, which is played by a well known cast including Sigourney Weaver as the control officer on the ship. After leaving the planet, one of the member is attacked by a mutant that basically latches onto your face and stay there. But, what they don't know is that the movie's villain is on the ship. Alien has a great deal in special effects and its set direction is the one I like the most. There are also great shots of scenes involving claustrophobia. But, one of the most famous scenes in the movie is when the member who recovers from being attack by the facehugger and then, he finds out that a chestburster or a parasite is inside of him. This scene is very gory and is not for the faint-hearted. Alien is a great movie because it is like Jaws, or in other words, have a great deal in suspense. The background score is really frightening for those scenes where the Alien pops out. An terrific science fiction thriller. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 4 stars.",

210,19 December 2022,M1dnitee,8, Obviously a classic,"Everyone likes Alien, it's got Sigourney Weaver for goodness sakes. It is one of the most well known and highly rated movies for many good reasons. This movie on its own is great because of its cast of good actors and sound effects. For it's time this was a pretty high-tech movie even just for a guy walking around in a scarily detailed rubber costume jumping at people. In my personal opinion this movie has better sound effects than Star Wars, which is comparable as they are both space sci-fi and of the same era (Talking about original trilogy of Star Wars). This movie when compared to all of the other movies in the same franchise makes it an instant go-to. This is because when compared to the other movies in the series, the later ones get more and more repetitive. And don't even get me started on Prometheus, I'm not sorry if you like that movie. Also, (spoilers ahead) the twist at the end of the movie where the Alien was on the ship with Ripley the whole time when she was going home is just immediately something that every good film maker is willing to replicate. Now, my history isn't very good so if they did get that twist from another movie then please correct me. But VFX and SFX aside the storyline is just overall really entertaining and fun. I may or may not just be bias because I get to watch people die because of face huggers and parasites. I also find it funny that everyone dies on the ship except for Ripley, I mean obviously you aren't gonna follow the story of someone who dies, because well, story. But how only one person manages to survive amuses me. I don't know how to end a review so I'm just gonna say you should totally watch this class I 100% recommend. ""Back to the ole freezerinos""",

First off, Ridley Scott is easily one of my favorite directors, so it's easy to say for me that his creative brilliance is easily one of the most impressive things about this film. The tone is perfectly executed, and the worldbuilding is endlessly engaging and interesting. Scott doesn't expect his audience to be idiots, and therefore the film is full of clever tactics and not repetitive of dialogue and situations as it easily could have been. The set direction is absolutely outstanding, as well as the look of much of the scenery and the costumes at hand. Its impressive to build a believable sci-fi world around your film, and I strongly feel no film has ever done it better than the Alien franchise (at least most of them anyway). The pacing can be a bit slow at times, mainly towards the middle of the movie, and has a few duller moments. All the actors involved truly give it their all especially lead actress Sigourney Weaver, and Ian Holm as Ash. In the end, Alien manages to still hold up today as a classic alien thriller- and is easily some of director Ridley Scott's best work.",

Of an interesting note the great Walter Hill, with no previous experience of the Sci-Fi genre, ended up as the producer (and also writing one of the first drafts).

Wells's classic novel 'War of The Worlds', aliens have been one of the most iconic fictional creatures to stand the test of time in the science-fiction genre. This sci-fi/horror creature feature takes the trophy of not only marking a solid directorial inauguration for Ridley Scott, but also for redefining the alien subgenre. This spine-chilling alien invasion piece not only shows off Scott's versatile directing chops, but also serves as an influential classic to inspiring many sci-fi/horror tropes of the past few decades. Although some may admire the director's visceral blend of sheering suspense and startling visual effects as the movie's most valued accolade, it is difficult to argue the astonishing influence that this film has spread over the past many years; especially when you look at the large number of cheesy rip- offs Hollywood has flown at us. This film centers on a commercial crew of seven members travelling through space on a spaceship known as the Nostromo. The crew is lead by Captain Dallas (Played by Tom Skeritt) and consists of members Ellen Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver), Lambert (played by Veronica Cartwright), Brett (played by Harry Dean Stanton), Kane (played by John Hurt), Ash (played by Ian Holm), and Parker (played by Yaphet Kotto).

232,8 March 2019,Benjamin-M-Weilert,10, The epitome of the sci-fi/horror sub-genre.,"Science fiction in film has faced an uphill battle in terms of being taken seriously. Up until the late 1960's, most sci-fi was low-budget, B-movie schlock more likely to be Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fodder than Oscar potential. This all changed in 1968 with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Now that sci-fi could be considered art it took almost a decade for other films to capitalize on Kubrick's groundbreaking work. Star Wars (1977) expanded on the special effects and made sci-fi a fun, action-filled ride. Regarding the horror aspect of sci-fi, Alien (1979) remains the founding film of these combined genres.",
233,9 October 2020,mateusolivotti,9, a striking film,"Alien is certainly one of the most striking and influential sci-fi films of all time, after all, the feature film released in 1979 serves as inspiration for several current films and series. Undoubtedly one of the things that stand out the most in the film is its simply incredible practical effects, the film was released over 40 years ago and even today they are incredible, and of course, the film would be nothing but Ridley Scott's direction that unlike many films at the time, the director prefers to leave a mystery around the creature, which really reveals itself only at the end of the film.
In my opinion, the only reason this film is not perfect is that it has at least 4 or 5 minutes more than it should have, there is a scene at the end of the film that would be perfect if it ended there, but instead the film he decides to continue with one more threat, which he resolves until quickly.",

236,4 June 2016,writtenbymkm-583-902097,1, Check your brain at the door,"SPOILER ALERT. I suppose it's asking too much to want a sci-fi movie that's halfway intelligent. ""Alien"" is not. If you start thinking about this movie, it falls apart. I'll try to be brief. One, if I'm not missing something, the ""Company"" that owns the spaceship knows about this horrible alien monster, knows it ""can't be killed"" (Ash, the robot, actually says this), and wants the monster brought back to Earth, ""crew expendable."" Question, if the monster can't be killed, but it kills each and every human it sees, how the heck are they going to get it off the spaceship when it gets back to Earth? And what will they do with it then? That's absurd. Two, how does the Company know the spaceship crew will even get the monster on board to bring it back in the first place? There's no way at all for the Company to assume this. Three, the only reason the monster got inside the spaceship was because of an incredibly stupid thing one of the crew did. If you were on an unknown alien planet and you saw some ""eggs,"" would you try to go down and sniff at them and put your face as close to them as possible? And when one of them started to open, would you just stand there and get even closer to it? This is beyond stupid, it's insane. Four, once the monster is on the ship and hugging this guy's face, it disappears, and suddenly another monster pops out of his chest. Seriously? This rather sizable alien being with a big ugly head has been living inside a man's chest but he never felt any pain and none of his organs suffered any damage, not his lungs, not his heart, nothing? I didn't buy that for one second. Five, this creature supposedly has ""molecular acid"" (ha ha) flowing through its body, an acid so strong that it can eat right through steel like a knife through warm butter -- but the creature itself is immune? Right. Six, once the entire crew except for Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is dead, she decides to blow up the ship and escape in the shuttle. So she has to go through a cumbersome series of physical actions, including pulling up big tubes, just to set a destruct signal, and then it gives her ten minutes -- ten minutes, folks -- to go to the bathroom, find her cat, get to the shuttle, strip down to her micro-panties for us, ten minutes. In a sane world, on a sane ship, you'd be able to set the destruct for any time you liked, and you'd be able to get on the shuttle first and then activate the destruct signal. Finally, only a guess from the way they made it look, but evidently the ship was destroyed in a nuclear explosion, while Ripley is still close enough that she (and her cat) would be killed by the radiation. (Even in ""Forbidden Planet"" they knew enough to get the ship far away from the explosion.) So, for all those reasons, this is a movie that is so scientifically stupid and impossible that I couldn't believe it or enjoy it at all. Where are Joel and the bots when you need them? P. S. People smoke cigarettes on a spaceship -- yeah, right.",

Indeed it was just a guy in a rubber suit but the way it is shot means you never actually see it untill right at the very end. It's a great example of working within limitations and producing a superior movie as a result. These days with CGI movie makers can more or less show anything they wish but as the likes of Alien Covernent demonstrate that doesn't produce a better movie.",

The script never falls apart with one of the most steady spaced movies I have ever watched. The acting is unknowingly great, depending on your observations of certain characters. The ship is fully developed, with a crew that does not hesitate in any scene with their brilliant chemistry. The ship design feels dirty and lived in, keeping the advanced look. Every time a button is pressed to put in commands or a lever is pulled the ship responds. The Alien design is many peoples favorites, feeling real. For 1979 this movie is revolutionary in visuals and props, never looking too fake. If there is anything I would have to say this movie does best on, it is the cinematography.

266,11 July 2014,Incendid,9, A truly original survival horror film.,"Jacob's Review: Alien is the first entry to the Alien franchise and so far it is one of the best. The surprising element to me in this film was its pacing. Being raised in an era of film that is so ADD ridden and impatient could influence my thinking ability when it comes to analyzing film but it was so refreshing to see a movie that builds such an eerie and desolate atmosphere. The movie is patient and rather builds tension and character before SNAP and something horrific happens. This is what may dispirit a lot of viewers which is why many people prefer Aliens (1986) to the topic film. It works for me. The characters act like real people and the design, metamorphosis and behaviour of the alien creature is incredibly haunting but left open to interpretation due to the mystery that shrouds the creature (or later known as xenomorph) in its latter stage. If you haven't seen it then I recommend this truly unique gem to those with an attention span. 9/10",
267,18 February 2022,OneAnjel,10, MINDBENDING in any decade,"This is the film that launched Sigourney Weaver into stardom. I want to get that out of the way because I notice a lot of reviews claiming she was such a big star gracing this film. She was a virtual unknown at this time, just like most of the cast. Judging by her portfolio over the proceeding years, it was Ridley Scott who made her so wonderful in Alien. Sometimes a star can make a movie; sometimes a movie makes the star. Regardless, Alien was positively mind-bending when it first arrived in theatres, right up there with the impact of films like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Thing, and The Terminator. Many people like to make lists online of their top 50 or 100 greatest sci-fi/horror films and you get all kinds of stuff in there. But if you had to really narrow it down to, say, the top 10, Alien would be in there. Some reviews go on and on about how the premise has been done before, even many times. But I beg to differ. Yes, a group of people trapped somewhere fearing for their lives wasn't new but that's like saying Cast Away is a rip off of The Blue Lagoon. Show me where an alien bursts out of a man's stomach after being implanted in his face for days on board a giant space craft controlled by an artificial lifeform created by the military! Nope.

The emphasis is never on overt gore or relentless bloodshed (though blood isn't exactly lacking, here), rather it is always placed on the terror of not knowing exactly where the alien is or what it is truly capable of. The film expertly relies on slow-burning suspense and terrific tension to make sure its short bursts of skin-crawling shock pierce through the nail-biting atmosphere with ease, creating a sense of palpable dread right from the off that that never eases even when the crew seem at their safest. 8/10",

It can be done, Spielberg returned to Sci-Fi recently with Minority Report too great success. This film is superb, it spawned a genre in itself and is still a big influence. Visually this is only matched by probably Scott's other big Sci-Fi movie Blade Runner. The designs and the sets by HR Geiger are fantastic and Scott more than ably makes them look even better. The film was deservedly a record breaking film when it first came out. The cast are brilliant, the film is surprising and fresh and very tense.

Ridley Scott did a tremendous job in directing only his second feature film about a group of ordinary people being terrorized by a hideous breed of monster. The creativity of on how the monsters evolve throughout its life stages is just as intriguing as how they look aesthetically.

I even knew what the alien looks like so I wasn't having high expectations from this movie. But, It got me, boy! From beginning till the end, the movie was astounding. Unlike other movies which are made today (which show a lot of gore and are very action packed) Alien is the only alien movie that gives a creepy feeling of ""We are not alone"". Unlike today's movies, they spent the first few minutes only to show us the entire the art-direction of the ship and how it works. Surprisingly enough, all the important scenes take place in these areas. Ridley Scott very cleverly creates the tension, slowly and slowly and a bit fast and a bit more fast and then a bang in the end! I still wonder how the hell they must have created those creatures and that too with extremely higher detail. The story to has a hard solid structures with pretty shocking twists. This movie is not like those non-sense action horror movies where you just watch people dying. Alien is way ahead of even today's film-making. It's a true benchmark like 2001 A space Odyssey.

That Ridley Scott was partly influenced by Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)' is a given. When the Nostromo crew members are exploring the unknown planet in their spacesuits, Scott frames the action so that their space helmets claustrophobically crowd his hand-held camera; in this way, as in the Moon-walk in '2001,' the audience imagines themselves walking alongside these figures. It's this evocation of setting that most impressed me about 'Alien.'

306,5 January 2017,cdjh-81125,8, Definitive Sci Fi Brilliance,"When speaking about the greatest science fiction movies of all time Ridley Scott's Alien is a film that will come up in conversation and its very much deserving of such praise as this is a fantastically executed and atmospheric film that I truly found to be brilliant. For one this film looks fantastic, the interior design of the Nostromo is designed perfectly its not flashy or unbelievable but a realistic version of a space craft. The special effects are also perfect most likely (similarly to George Lucas with Star Wars) chose not to rely on them to much but instead use them sparingly using real life models to make it seem more realistic. The design of the titular Alien is also perfect, the design makes it look terrifying and imposing. The tension in this film is done perfectly due to Ridley Scott's masterful direction of this film made he made it very claustrophobic through long takes and wide shots that revealed to us just how little space there was for the characters to run. Also like the special effects he used the Alien itself sparingly we only really so it up close a few times which puts the viewer more in the shoes of the characters and makes the film all the more unpredictable. Another thing this will did very well was get out a truly fantastic central performance from Sigourney Weaver who is just cast to perfection in this film she's a strong and intelligent lead that is extremely likable and was the perfect conduit for the audience to experience the horror. There is never a moment from the first act on wards where the viewer feels completely safe and it made this film much more enjoyable. When such a menacing force such as the Alien in this film is built up its hard to make its eventual demise satisfying but this film did it, it was built up perfectly to the point where it seemed unlikely that the protagonists would succeed. However my biggest issue with the film is it's first act as while the slow pace worked for the second and third act in the beginning it did bore me and didn't grab my attention like the rest of the film did.

Tom Skerritt plays the captain, Dallas, who convinces the team to suit up and investigate the distress beacon of unknown origin. Ripley, who is played by Sigourney Weaver, is second in command and seems to advise against the risky protocol. When Kane, played by John Hurt, looks into a pod on the abandoned ship a face hugger springs out and attached itself to him, incapacitating Kane. Ripley follows the quarantine procedure when notified that Kane has an unknown organism attached to him, disregarding the captain and various crew members begging to be let back on to help Kane. The medical officer on board, Ash, played by Ian Holm, decides to let them on anyway. After quarantining Kane finally, the organism dies and falls off. During dinner, before the crew is to go back to the stasis pods, Kane begins seizing and in a shocking turn of events a small creature is birthed out of his chest killing him instantly. The first theme appears here, it is uncomfortable because it is a theme of rape, and the concept of unwanted birth. The crew searches for the animal with nets and a cattle prod, only to discover that it has grown to be approx. 7-9 ft. and devours them one at a time when they least suspect it. The Alien uses its inner mouth to puncture and penetrate its victims, very disturbing imagery to convey rape. The Alien designer is a mechanical artist from Germany, who focused on sexual themes. His most prominent works include the Necronomicon, translated to ""The book of the dead"". Ripley, after communicating with the ships AI, discovers that the medical officer and mother have been in contact the entire mission, and that there is a mission protocol only made known to Ash that states: ""All other priorities rescinded, bring back life-form"". This begins to make more sense as Ash is a robot sent by ""the company"" which is Weyland-Yutani, to fulfill that mission even if it means killing the rest of the crew. Ripley finds out that the company had meant for all of this to happen before they had even left, finding the ship on LV-426, and bringing the creature back. The government is also working with the company Wey-Yu, Weyland-Yutani shortened, to develop this creature as a biological weapon. The main motivators for this behavior for the Govt. and the company is money, greed, and power. It would appear that the corruption of these powers at play would be a theme for the film as well as the entire franchise. Finally Ripley is the only one left, and she blows the ships reactor while escaping on a lifeboat pod to hopefully ensure the Aliens death. She realizes the Alien is also on the lifeboat in a state of hibernation, she suits up quietly and blows the Alien out of the air lock with a harpoon gun. She sets off in her vessel and goes into stasis hoping to be found by anyone in that section of the star system. The most effective scenes in my opinion would be through the uses of camera angles as well as lighting. For example, the scene where the full grown Alien attacks its first victim on the ship shows an angle that you can see the Alien in the background but it is so still in such an unnatural position that you don't take notice until it unfolds itself into the perfect predatory position to kill the crew member. Another example would be when the alien gets its first close up, the lighting mixed with the heavy drooling, and a terrific sound design makes for such a frightening moment. The captain goes into the bowls of the ship to snuff the creature out, when the motion detector becomes hard to read he runs right into the alien without knowing. Armed with a flamethrower that emits a flickering light, and a flash light, the alien is exposed with a quick turn of the lighting. The Alien leaps in full blown aggression screeching through the small ventilation shafts killing the captain. All of these things make for one of the best if not the best horror film of all time, arguably. I have personally seen this movie over 100 times, and it never gets old or less disturbing. Its themes are still relevant and I cannot recommend this film enough, if you have not seen it you are missing out on a cinematic experience that is on the top tier of film.",

312,2 November 2013,jackasstrange,7, Average spacecraft thriller.,"I never was a big fan of the Alien series. Always thought that they were way too dumb. However, i've never watched the very first one; the one which started everything, the original Alien. Until today. And to be honest, i am a bit disappointed. It's a very well made film, even more for the standards of 1979, but to the story itself...well, i just don't care for it at all. Sure, the film has great visuals, the spacecraft is full of interesting details, but the story is dry. The character development is not adequate at all, and this is an aspect which i consider fundamental in any film. We don't have any deep idea of who are the persons in there, or what they were doing, or what they are going to do. Then, the thriller? Almost none. And it's not scary. To the well of the truth, almost all the times the 'scariest' moments were very predictable and even unintentionally comic.",

From the establishing shots alone, Ridley Scott showcases an eerie visual flair that puts the viewer on edge from beginning to end. The empty corridors, heavy shadows and a hauntingly subtle score create an uneasy atmosphere that is almost as intimidating as the creature itself. Speaking of, the Alien creature is a masterpiece in costume design, with an iconic look taken from H.R Giger that still holds up to this day, in part of course due to the excellent lighting that only allows for glimpses of the monster, preying upon the viewer's fear of the unknown. Moreover, the small cast of unfortunate Space Truckers creates a level of grit and realism to the characters as a result of the excellent dialogue and acting. The iconic Chestburster scene alone demonstrates the film's use of shock value, expertly crafted special effects and unrelenting tension to culminate in a hauntingly gruesome scene.

The film features a crew traveling in there large carry ship to drop collected fuel from other planets down to earth. The film is slow moving at start but does pick up the pace later. The crew stop on a plant to check there damaged ship to find on the plant they have stopped on has an underground monument. In the monument there is an egg that one of the crew members awakens the creature inside attacking him this creature is the bought on board the ship as it has latched ont the crew members face. When they get it of its spawn is planted inside the cremate which causes the famous chest burst scene. The alien then gets loose about the ship.

That's the summary of the plot you'll see if you read it on IMDb. But what does that really mean? Well, I could go on and on and on about it, but in short it simply means, one of the best science fiction films of all time. Basically the plot goes as follows; The Commercial Starship Nostromo is en-route back to Earth when the crew is awakened from Hyper-Sleep on orders from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation (who own the ship and employ the crew), to investigate what amounts to be an SOS from a downed Alien Spacecraft. Once the crew touches down on the planet, LV-426, the captain and two supporting crew members venture out into the crashed vessel, and soon a crew member has an alien life form attached to his face, and has to be returned to the ship immediately. After the crew determines that they can do nothing further while on the planet, the ship returns to space and the crew prepare for hyper-sleep again. Also by this time, the crew member with the alien attached to his face has mysteriously recovered and the alien itself seems to have fallen off and died. This proves to be WAY wrong when the true intentions of the creature become clear by way of an Alien bursting out from inside the crewman's chest. In the confusion, the creature gets away into the bowels of the ship, and now let the terror and suspense and the basis for most ""Monster Movies"" for the next 30 years ensue.",

342,14 July 2009,Aaron1375,9, The alien movie that started it all.,"This movie is sort of like another science fiction movie that had the same basic premise from the 50's or 60's, but this one really set off a lot of alien movies and copycats from somewhat good ones, to a whole bunch of bad ones made by the Italians and Roger Corman. Of course, of the alien movies that are in this Alien series my favorite is Aliens as that one was just totally cool. This one though is by far the best horror of the four movies. Has great moments and great atmosphere and has all the elements needed to be a great horror movie. Do not know which I like better though as a horror movie this or John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" both being movies that can show others out there how to make a good horror movie. This one has a mining vessel searching a planet that has what appears to be some sort of alien vessel on it. Writing this review now I can easily see where the video game ""Dead Space"" got a lot of its plot. Well it is not to long that some sort of alien lifeform attaches itself to one of the crew and refuses to let go or to even let anyone tamper with it. That is okay it falls off and dies in a bit and that is where the fun starts. I will not go into how, but now stalking the crew of this mining vessel is one deadly creature capable of killing nice and quickly. There are other parts to the plot, but I do not wish to ruin them for those few out there that have not yet seen this fine flick. The monster is done by costume for the most part and it looks better than any computer monster done these days. So for a complete horror experience try either this movie or The Thing.",

344,17 January 2014,Our_Feature_Presentation,9, Alien,"Alien. The title really says all you need to know. Alien is a science fiction horror film made in 1979 it was very revolutionary and helped mold the modern horror genera and modern sci fi genera. The movie starts by really showing off the sets that were made to stimulate the ship, Nostromo, it all looks amazing more so considering there was no CGI (computer generated images). The movie does start off a bit slow but it's all set up one the crew lands on the planet then the movie really gets going. Ridley Scott, the movie's director, did a marvelous job with suspense. Your always waiting for the next thing to happen and it's very scary. The movie's characters feel a lot like real people, the main character being Ripley. The character of Ripley has now become a pop culture icon and one of the best heroines in any art medium. Alien is also has incredible special effects, most notably chest burster scene were the baby alien pops out of a characters chest, this scene has become an icon of horror, sci fi, and cinema in general. The full grow alien design is another icon in film. It's terrifying and original the Xenomorph (yes it has a name) is easily my favorite movie monster design. So lets wrap this up. Alien has a great haunting atmosphere, good side characters with a great main character, amazing build up of suspense that's able to generate real scares, sets and special effects that are some of the best ever in a movie and all wrapped up with the greatest creature design, Alien gets a 10 out of 10 and at one point it was my number one favorite movie.",

The air duct scene is very tense and creepy. Sir Ridley Scott directing is great and gives out some really fantastic suspense scenes. The acting is great, this is the first time we Sigourney Weaver as one of her most famous roles: Ellen Ripley. The plot of the film sees a cargo ship returning to Earth, the crew members wake up from their hyper-sleep and can't wait to go home. While flying through space they pick up a distress signal from a near by planet so they decide to land, the ship gets damaged and they're stuck on the planet, some of the crew decide to check the planet out for anything and soon come across a huge spaceship in the distance, they enter and soon discover a huge skeleton of an Alien life form in the ship with a hole in it's chest, they search deeper into the ship and Kane falls down the hole, in the hole he discovers a room full of Pods, he inspects one of them and it opens then a spider like creature called a Facehugger jumps out and attach√©s to his face, melting through his helmet. They return to the ship with Kane but Ripley can't allow Kane into the ship because of Quarantine but Ash lets them in. In the medical room they study the Facehugger and learn that it's keeping Kane alive like a host, they try to get it off but it's grip tightens. They then go and try to cuts it's legs off but it's blood spill and melts through the floor since it's blood is acid. After a while they see that the Facehugger as came off Kane, the Facehugger itself is dead. Kane wakes up and they go to have dinner but during it Kane starts to act strange and soon falls on the table then suddenly something bursts through his chest. The Chestbuster then runs off and after a while they go looking for it. Ripley's cat Jones escapes and so one of them has to go look for him because he will be picked up on the tracker as well as the Alien. Searching for Jones suddenly the Alien shows up not small but now fully grown and kills him, they discover that the Alien is moving around through the air ducts so the Captain decides to search the air ducts for the Alien but he is attacked by it. Ripley checks the ships computer and discovers that the company wanted the Alien life form on the chip for their Bio weapons programme and the crew are expendable. Ripley sees Ash next to her and soon he attacks her, the others hurry in and help Ripley and they discover they Ash is a Droid sent by the company to retrieve the Alien, after destroying him they decide that the only way to stop the Alien is to destroy the ship and escaping from the small ship. Getting the air supplies while Ripley goes to the ship they are attacked and killed by the Alien leaving Ripley on her own with it, taking the Flamethrower she goes to self-destruct the ship and on her way out she encounters the Alien and runs. Trying to stop the self-destruct sequence she fails and must escape from the ship. Leaving with her cat Jones she quickly leaves the ship before it self-destructs. She goes to go into her cryogenics tube but suddenly sees that the Alien is in the ship with her, she carefully puts on a spacesuit and takes the harpoon gun then straps herself to the chair and forces the Alien to come out with hot steam, then she presses the button and opens the airlocks then she shoots the Alien and it hangs on the outside then she burns it with the engines finally stopping the Alien then shes goes into hyper-sleep with her cat Jones while her ship flies through space.

Firstly, the miniscule cast. It consisted of nine people, including the alien and the cat (not really a person), whom we really get to know and relate to. The characters are well developed, the acting fine. Next, the claustrophobic and tense atmosphere. Everything that goes on is in the same ship, making for (almost) no escape, hence the claustrophobic effect. When some of the crew check out the alien ship, the atmosphere is very tense as we don't know what will happen next. Next, the way it didn't feel staged in any way. It felt REAL, which was the whole point. The conversations weren't just one person talking at a time, rather several at once.

They simply don't make films like this anymore Hollywood won't risk it or this generation won't appreciate it. One of the great strengths of ""Alien"" is its pacing. It takes its time. It waits. It allows silences.Today's slasher movies, in the sci-fi genre and elsewhere, are all pay-off and no buildup.The result is a film that absorbs us in a mission before it involves us in an adventure, and that consistently engages the alien with curiosity and logic, instead of simply firing at it.We have now descended into a bog of Gotcha! movies in which various horrible beings spring on a series of victims, usually teenagers. The ultimate extension of the genre is the Geek Movie, illustrated by the remake of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" which essentially sets the audience the same test as an old-time carnival geek show: Now that you've paid your money, can you keep your eyes open while we disgust you?

If i didn't know what time the movie was made, i would've guessed it was made in the 2000s. Definitely a must watch because it lives up to everyone's expectation.

At any rate, Alien still is a classic. We have a female hero, we have H.R.Giger's imagination, and we have one mean alien. The filmmakers wanted to show an image of ""truckers in space"", hence the blue collar looking workers and chains, and an ""inside a factory"" like appearance.

372,14 June 2017,drqshadow-reviews,10," An Intense, Authentic, Timeless Blend of Horror and Sci-Fi","A fantastic time-capsule from the late '70s, the era of patient filmmaking, practical effects and potent new ideas. In borrowing from and expanding upon themes first incubated in Kubrick's 2001, director Ridley Scott delivers a tangible, chilling take on humanity's star-faring future. The basic concept is devilishly simple: a hapless freighter crew lands on an uncharted planet, picks up a murderous uninvited guest, then spends the rest of the picture trying (and failing) to outlast it in a claustrophobic environment. But there's so very much more to it than that. Expert character development rewards us with an intensely human, accessible crew. It really hurts each time one of them succumbs to a howling, terrified death. The film represents a master class in tension-building, investing long spans of film in thick, dramatic pauses that pay dividends. It works as a social allegory, too: even generations from now, with our destiny amidst the stars, the working class draws the short straw and risks everything for a meager paycheck. And, perhaps most impressive of all, it's a jaw-dropping visual powerhouse. The style in this film is unmatched, from the fuzzy monitors and tangled wires aboard the flight deck to H.R. Geiger's legendary grotesque monster and environment designs. We enjoy a constant sense of wonder, awed by what we're seeing but grounded by the perceived physical reality of it all. All this, and I haven't even mentioned the acting, direction or effects work. A sci-fi legend through and through, this is one of the best-realized (and finest-aging) genre torchbearers ever.",

I have seen very, very few films with this level of investment in the small details- but something that Ridley Scott is well known for, particularly in films like Blade Runner. The sets look lived in, but very thematically on point, futuristic, and most importantly- Alien. It doesn't look like anything on earth, but certainly what we could imagine a spacecraft, alien ship, or remote planet to look like. Given that there are only really two locales in the entire film, a variety of sets are needed, and it's delivered well, from the creepy engine room to the cramped crew quarters, to a stark white medical facility, to dank maintenance corridors, everything has Scott's touch all over it, and I think this is part of why the movie holds up so well. It's also clear that a great many influences were taken from the recently released Star Wars: A New Hope (1977) with ship design, set pieces, and the camera angles used in space, especially the opening shot of the ship from the low angle, but in the best possible way.",

Every single aspect of this film is flawless, from its elaborate set design to its captivating cinematography. Scott's direction is polished and skillful, building up great amounts of tension (with the help of a fantastic score by Jerry Goldsmith) and resulting in a fantastic and terrifying climax. But what really shines in this film is the acting, with a profound and real performance from Sigourney Weaver. Weaver brings the character of Ripley to life and makes her feel like a real character. By displaying the right amount of terror and the perfect amount of badass, Weaver's character becomes an instant favorite among any horror movie franchise. The plot of Alien is nice and straightforward, as most horror films should be, leaving the focus to be on the survival of the characters. What makes Alien stand out from the rest, is its underlying metaphors that give the film depth and complexity.

As a nine-year old, I was impressed by _Rocketship XM_ but my dad, who *was* a rocket scientist, laughed throughout it and spoilt it for me. The _Nostromo_ in _Alien_ was a junker tractor rocket; it had *dents* for Christ's sake! So it was real. Most of the crew were derelicts as well, so the fit the ship and the plot. Not too bright, and more than a wee bit clumsy. The Alien was designed by a Swiss (Geiger) who knew his biology. In the insect world, *all* the wasps reproduce by laying eggs on or inside the body of a host, be it a spider or caterpillar. It is now believed there is a separate wasp species for every caterpillar species -- and that's a few! The extrudable alien mouthpiece is an exact copy of a dragonfly nymph's mouth -- he uses it to catch small fish. 'Nother thing about this alien: most early aliens might look scary, but they were dumb and slow. You had to be a total klutz/moron (or a pretty blond) to get caught. *This* alien is smart, very smart, . . . and FAST! Nothing like it before this film. Sigourney Weaver is a delight, Skerrit is a good captain, John Hurt makes a great first meal for Mr. Alien, and Harry Dean Stanton always contributes his own special charm. Then, there's ""Jonesy""!! True star quality!
Talk about pregnant suspense: all you can want and more. The music was ethereal and totally appropriate, great art direction and camera work. A classic, with a light touch to get the best scare out of one.
One other note: After seeing it (and having bad dreams), I needed to go back and see it again! It was even more scary the *second* time because I knew what was going to happen and couldn;t stop it! Talk about living a nightmare, and paying good money to do it! :-)",

The actors are great, especially Sigourney Weaver, and she is very good as portraying Lt. Ripley. The movie is set in the future, and is basically about a spaceship that gets a call while in space to check out a distress signal coming from a distant planet. The crew of the spaceship come into contact with an alien lifeform, and must fight to survive, as well as save the human race. The feel of the movie and characters is very authentic, which, (along with the excellent story), is why I love it so much.

The violence is well placed and not over-done or glorified. Explanations are well thought out and suspense is also top-notch. The conception and implementation of the creature itself still beats the CGI of today over 25 years later. I might have enjoyed a little bit more exploration or implications on the crashed/abandoned ship, to understand the ship's origins, but thats part of the fun anyway, leaving it up to the viewer.

388,6 March 2021,judemcrobbie,10, The best horror ever?,"I am not a man who likes horror. This being said, I enjoyed this so much.
It's hard to believe this was 1979 as the effects of the spaceship and the alien look incredibly real.
The fear of the alien and the atmosphere in the ship goes deeper than just fear. It preys on your morality as the alien (especially the face hugger) seems to me as a sexual metaphor, that of rape. And everyone that rape is wrong, but also disgusting. This is how it prays on our morality as it feels deep down that this is not only wrong but that it crosses a line. Couple this with other sexual metaphors through the movie, subtle and not subtle.
This movie also preys on your sense of empathy. Not only do you feel sorry for them on this ship, but the alien only makes it's move when they're at their weakest, usually small and distracted. This gets the parental instincts going and double scares.
As is said in Batman Begins ""you always fear what you don't understand"". No movie hammers this home more than Alien. There's a multitude of ways it creates the unknown aspect of this movie, but probably the most prominent is the decision to not show us the alien in all total at all, yes we see teeth and it's face but you can't comprehend it, because of the little amount shown and the little time shown as well. Another way how it creates this is because of the lack of familiarity. The spacecraft setting is completely unfamiliar, and therefore has none of the comforts of home. They also complain about the standard of food and talk about the recycled air, also making us feel the unfamiliarity eating our fresh food and breathing a fresh air. Maybe Ridley Scott is making us think about preserving what we have.
The way how it lingers too long makes the jump scares so incredibly scary.
The cast is literally 7. This is perfect as every character has clear, memorable quirks and traits distinguishing them apart from everyone. This makes the impending doom even harder to stomach as we feel a personal connection to each of the characters. I guess the lead would have to be Sigourney Weaver's Ripley but everyone is so powerful that each one could carry the others. Ripley is skeptical from the go and the definition of an active protagonist which drives the interest of plot perfectly. On top of this she plays it perfectly, trying to almost show that she needs to overcompensate for the skills she's lacking against others and especially the alien.
I can't decide whether I like this or Psycho (1960) better but they're are 2 horror classics.

If you haven't seen this landmark epic that spawned a franchise, then you haven't experienced genuine dread. Happily, the years haven't robbed this terrific gem of its skin crawling repulsion. Three sequels that followed in its wake, but only James Cameron's ""Aliens"" came close to replicating its intensity. Like any good film, ""Alien"" boasts several surprises that will catch you off guard and alarm you. Most of the action is confined to the murky confines of a shadowy spacecraft with passages galore. Reportedly, Scott and scenarist Dan O'Bannon were influenced by director Edward L. Cahn's ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"" (1958) and Mario Bava's ""Planet of the Vampires"" (1964) with Barry Sullivan. It is easy to see the resemblance in the plot between ""Alien"" and Cahn's epic where a monster boards a spacecraft before it blasts off and the crew spent the entire flight battling the monster as it corners the heroes. On the other hand, the set design in the Bava film is virtually replicated in Scott's film. Mind you, neither of those two inspirations is anywhere near as chilling as ""Alien."" The eponymous monster is a memorable predator that you won't soon forget. Indeed, coursing through the veins of this lethal life-form is acid that eats through the metal hull of the ship.",
400,8 December 2017,Uriah43,8, Horror and Science-Fiction Combined,"This film begins aboard a commercial space craft named ""The Nostromo"" which is manned by a crew of seven and serves as a refinery for 20,000,000 tons of mineral ore. As the story unfolds, the spaceship was initially headed back to Earth while the crew were put into suspended animation. When they awaken they discover that they have been rerouted to another part of space in order to check out a strange message from what could be of alien origin. Although they had hoped to return to Earth on schedule, due to company policy they are required to investigate so they begrudgingly follow orders and land on a small planet while sustaining some damage to the space craft in the process. However, since the source of the transmission is nearby they decide to check it out and find an alien spaceship which contains the dead body of a strange creature with a gaping hold inside of it which appears to have imploded from within. They also discover several leathery eggs on board as well--and this is where the trouble starts. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was one of the scariest movies-and certainly the scariest science-fiction film-I have ever seen. It had a good plot, excellent suspense and a solid cast which included Tom Skerritt (as ""Dallas""), Sigourney Weaver (""Ripley""), Yaphet Kotto (""Parker"") and Harry Dean Stanton (""Brett"") among others.

401,1 November 2015,Bijan_Karim,8, Perhaps the most competently made horror film ever,"There has always been one big debate with Alien. Is it a horror film, or is it a science fiction film? The answer to me is simple, it is both. Although, I do believe that it is primarily a horror film. Barry Keith has said that the distinguishing factor between science fiction and horror is that ""The appeal of science fiction is primarily cognitive, while horror¬Öis essentially emotional."" The reason that I think of Alien as a horror film, is that all of the science in it is there to instil an emotional reaction, specifically the emotion of terror. The production design, art direction, make-up, writing, all rely heavily on science fiction ideals and visuals. However, all of these ideas and visuals are presented in a way to scare the audience. The large spaceship with its dark, narrow corridors serves the purpose of a massive, claustrophobic haunted house. The alien is designed to play on the audience's fears. Even the android character is primarily used for scares, as even he takes the place of a villain from a slasher film in the second half of, similar to the alien. If the film were primarily science fiction, all of the inventions and futuristic elements would primarily be in presented to cognitively affect the viewers. Though the film does have some science fiction ideas that aren't meant to purely instil horror. However, none of these ideas have the sense of awe or wonder that is usually to be expected from science fiction. The space travellers in the film are miners who see what they do as labor rather than a journey. The idea of a dirty, muddy, industrial look was foreign to space operas and science fiction at the time of the film's release. This is where the film succeeds as pure science fiction. ",
402,30 September 2005,evanston_dad,9," In Space, No One Can See You Wet Your Pants","The film that can reduce grown men to tears, this movie scared the crap out of me the first time I saw it and still does. While its immediate sequel, James Cameron's ""Aliens"" (1986) is very good too, it's really more harrowing than frightening. Ridley Scott's original is just plain creepy as hell. It's rare to find a film more atmospheric than this one. Though I don't know what it's like to be on a space crew on board a big-ass ship in the middle of the universe, somehow I think it would be just like this. And it doesn't get more unsettling than the scene where the crew heads out to investigate a distress signal and come across the empty remains of a giant ship with a big batch of eggs growing on the floor. Need I say more? Despite the notorious reputation of John Hurt's dinner scene, the film isn't that gory. If there's anyone left on the planet who doesn't know what I'm talking about, I won't ruin it. But let's just say the next time you're at a dinner party and someone begins retching violently while his stomach starts bubbling, clear away the dishes and grab a blunt object. But other than that, the scares are primarily psychological. Filmed before the days when CGI could do everything for film makers, the visual effects team here knew if they showed too much of the alien, it would just look cheesy. Therefore, the audience never sees much more of it than brief glimpses, and our dread builds with the dread of the crew, because we don't know what we're dealing with anymore than they do.

The setup is simplistic as a group of salvages in deep space answer an sos and discover an alien species that attaches itself to one of its crew. Later on he awakes and seems fine but soon after a deadly creature erupts from his chest killing him and begins knocking off the crew one at a time. Ridley Scott's perfect classic is intense and nightmarish suspenseful with fine performances all around but Sigourney Weaver is the real standout here. She injects Ripley with a vulnerability and strength that seems genuine and engaging. She's one of the fiercest heroines ever. The movie has garnered such a huge following over the years and rightly so it's one of the best movies ever made!,

405,23 October 2016,onlythusfar,9, A Wonderful Film,"This film has tons of positives going for it. On first viewing, I wasn't too impressed by it, but on later viewings, I grew to appreciate it more and more. The art direction/special effects, were outstanding, including of course Giger's amazing designs. The acting was very good on all accounts, especially by Sigourney Weaver. The direction, was very well done by Mr. Scott, whom it is said convinced the studio to give the film a bigger budget. The music was excellent, paying homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey. The atmosphere was fittingly sombre and realistic, unlike the rather puerile, operatic ""Star Wars"". I was disappointed by some dumb horror-movie character decisions in the plot near the end (eg.; threatened with imminent death, Ripley goes running around the ship looking for a cat ! and the tough Black man doesn't blow away the creature along with the inept Veronica Cartwright character. He didn't seem, like such a stupid softy throughout the movie. My main disappointment however, was that the ""Alien"" wasn't given more explanation. Did it actually eat the people, that it killed, and if not, why did it kill, if it wasn't necessary? Also, it displayed no particular intelligence, not even, as much as, the cat. I know, it was just meant to be a killer monster, but it would have been interesting, being an alien, if it had a bit more depth. None-the-less an excellent film. James Cameron's sequel was also excellent, if a little over-blown. Even the third sequel was good. I think, that the excellent actors really gave life to all three movies, especially having the consistency of Ms. Weaver, as the main character. She's one smart lady.",

Probably the first aspect which pushes ""Alien"" passed many other films, is how it slowly brings us into a ""universe"" without being self-conscious about it, somewhat similar to the first space sequence of ""2001"". To be fair, ""2001"" did pave the way for films like ""Alien"" and ""Star Wars"".

This is the sort of horror movie everyone remembers, and it has stood the test of time like no other movie in the genre (with the exception of, perhaps, Psycho or The Shining) ever has. The phrase 'in space nobody can hear you scream' has never been so effective, and the movie relies on atmosphere to generate this effectiveness. This is a risky decision for any movie developer, since if that atmosphere is not established well enough, then the movie looses all sense of fear and tension. Here, however, this is not the case. The alien is instantly established as a threat - ever since that infamously gory scene in the cafeteria; you all know which one I'm talking about - and this threat, combined with the tight hallways and sense of claustrophobia, is what shapes Alien into the terrifying, chilling movie that is renowned as even more than 25 years later.",

Even before that of course, there was Mario Bava's Planet of the Vampires, but Scott infuses his film with such elegance, sheer horror, and it's very own mythos (which would be tirelessly explored in the aforementioned extended multi-media universe), that to label the seminal sci-fi classic as plagiarism of Bava's interesting, if schlocky, 60's space opera would be preposterous (although it clearly draws inspiration). As a favourite of most children growing up in the 80's and 90's, Alien joins the likes of Jaws, Back to the Future, The Goonies and Close Encounters of the Third Kind as one of the untouchable genre classics.",

Each character is given distinguished personalities, and each actor does a beyond phenomenal job giving their characters life and realism. Ash the android is the stand-out performance for me because when you first watch the movie, he seems like a normal person who is smart and life-like and once its revealed that hes an android, its shocking, but when you watch the film again, you seem to realize that hes analyzing everything around him picking up information. The alien itself is the BEST alien design ever put to screen, the same could partly be said for the production design. This movie is very original in its style and most notably, the life cycle of the alien. While yes, it is a monster in the house movie, but its the execution that really makes this movie special.

Ridley Scott directs the movie with such an easy hand, he doesn't do anything unexpected, he just makes the movie as rock solid as a science fiction thriller will ever be. The alien itself, the movie's main character, is shockingly revealed half way through the movie as Nostromo's captain Dallas encounters the vicious creature in a one-way-ticket situation, and the alien is without doubt one of the most impressive and greatly made monsters in movie history.

Landing on the dark, seemingly lifeless, planet and the direlect spacecraft's interior, all beautifully rendered sets. Upon learning of the film's age, I was astounded at the SFX of a movie from 1979. People often remarked to this film as ""Jaws in outer space"", but let's be realistic here. This film far outdoes the shark puppet of Spielberg's. The creature designs are remarkably eery and somewhat sexual, H.R. Giger having done quite nicely here. The alien, no more than a class act man-in-a-suit with some KY jelly for drool, gives the impression of a terrifying monster that both fascinates and shocks.

Next, I watched The Martian, which is only memorable to me as being the first film I watched on my new blu-ray player, though it was a decent film. Alien fit my June theme of watching titles made up of one word or syllable. I guess what I'm getting at is that I've never been drawn to Ridley Scott's films for what they are, they've just always worked their way into my viewing schedules. After seeing Blade Runner last month, however, I began to become a bit more interested in Ridley Scott the director. His 1979 feature, Alien, starred Sigourney Weaver, and John Hurt as members of a team traveling through space to answer to an S.O.S. call from a distant moon. In what sounds like a paint-by-numbers who-dies-next film, Ridley Scott achieves an exceptionally atmospheric suspense film forcing itself to still be recognized today.",

I originally thought it was going to be just ok and overrated, but boy was I wrong. This movie has amazing characters, practical effects, and is just an amazing thriller in general. The story is simple; there's an alien on board, so try to survive. Most of the runtime of this movie is suspenseful, and has us as an audience connect and like these characters, not just pushing them into the movie hoping that you'll like them. The actual alien is really cool to look at, especially since it's not CGI, its all practical. The directing is perfect, the characters could not be better, the alien is actually intimidating, and the acting is just amazing. Ridley Scott did a damn good job directing this movie, but there's one thing that I don't love about it, and that's SOME of the music in the beginning, but that's it.

457,13 May 2017,eagandersongil,8, The terror of the unknown,"The cinematic work that inspired and shaped a genre, when in the late 1970s, visionary Ridley Scott decided to tackle a syfy suspense fiction, it was surprising, not that there has never been anything like it before, but focus on terror is something different , ""Alien"" is a cult and an inspiration for a whole pop culture that would be created later, besides being a great movie. Telling the story of an aircraft in the future manned by 7 astronauts that receives a strange call coming from a small mysterious planet, when descending to investigate they end up bringing inside the ship a curious and lethal form of alien life. We have a premise that would be widely copied over the years, with a focus on suspense, creating an atmosphere of terror but without throwing away syfy elements, ""Alien"" does not have a spectacular script, quite the opposite, the same Has many holes that almost 40 years later have not yet been solved, but even so, his script knows how to balance all elements of the film, besides being linear, thought-provoking and have a great rhythm. When ""Alien"" was released the man had already gone to the moon to ten years, even being a film where the space knowledge was not gigantic, the film commits innumerable gaffes, that for example ""Odyssey in space"" of 68 does not commit, that It bothers a little bit, but when we come across photography and the art direction, we leave it a little aside. Unlike other films of the genre, we have a full- blown photograph of dark tones, which is wonderful for the mood of the film, but it betrays a little the art direction of the film, which even dazzles, if it performs spectacularly well, full of buttons, levers And lights, the film perfectly transmits the atmosphere of the interior of a ship, and in a simple way manages to transmit a threatening planet, save a highlight to the interior of the ship to find in the planet of ""Aliens"", it is simply perfect and at the same time We can not fail to mention the great soundtrack, although little present, when the same discreetly participates in the film, always helps to perfectly compose the climate of the film, the edition of the film leaves to be desired, even if it is 2 hours, it seems Which is missing much in the film. We do not have great acting, so let's emphasize our unlikely heroine, the actress Sigourney Weaver - it's great how the movie builds an entire bow for a hero, and then changes that- But our featured character here is Alien himself, his whole aura Mysterious is great, the fact that little appears and is never very visible is fantastic and plays with the viewer's imagination, as well as being extremely scary, And finally, our medal of honor to Ridley Scott for practically grounding a genre And make a great movie.

459,9 February 2021,hoernkeem,10," Alien review (1979, Ridley Scott) Revolutionary sci-fi horror classic with one of the baddest ass female protagonists","Alien (1979, Ridley Scott)
This is a modern American classic. Enough said? I suppose I can break it down a bit more, but let's just say this is one of my favorite films and easily a top ten horror film for me. It is really a science fiction/horror amalgam which is a combo genre that go together like peas & carrots. This was only Scott's sophomore film and he decided to go with this project after seeing 'Star Wars' and realizing the potential. This film had financial success although critics gave mixed reviews. This is essentially a haunted house thriller in space, but done masterfully and some key decisions were made that took what still would have probably been a good movie and made it the cultural icon it became plus the haunted house motif works so well translated to this vast practically empty yet still claustrophobic space trawler.
First and foremost was casting and, of course, I mean taking what was supposed to be a male role in Ripley and creating one of film's most iconic female heroines. Ripley is second in command of the space ship Nostromo but she is the protagonist of the film. The rest of the cast don't comprise very many people but they all fill their roles brilliantly and with purpose. One of great things about this film is how the characters feel real. This place feels lived in and legitimate, and being able to sell dialogue in fantasy or science fiction is a major step in making the whole endeavor authentic and believable.
The plot here is very simple, and pretty much everyone knows it at this point. The Nostromo is returning to Earth from deep space and they get awoken still years away to investigate a transmission of unknown origin. While there one of the number is attacked and returned to the ship with an entity attached to his face. Later in one of the more memorable scenes in film history we see the first, but certainly not the last alien burst from someone's chest. From there it is deadly cat and mouse game as the alien kills the crew one by one until only it and Ripley (oh.... and the cat) remain ultimately destroying the unwanted intruder by blasting it into space. It is not an overly complex plot, but combine the actors, script and art direction and it creates one of the most indelible film tapestries for not only science fiction, but for horror as well.
Let's pay homage here to the incomparable work of H.R. Giger who was responsible for the design of the aliens as well as the set design. The aliens were like nothing seen before combining a sleek, aggressive biomechanical appearance with the enthralling elongated head carapace and the absolutely heart stopping double jaws. To this day it remains one of the most bad ass movie monsters ever and quite possibly the most lethal. It is referred to in the film as the perfect organism, and that might not be far off the mark. Your mind reels so much from the story that it is actually surprising to look back at how little the alien actually appears. This might be my one slight downcheck if any. This was a very conscious decision as Scott wanted the terrifying horror element more than a showcase of a monster running around killing people. Beyond the limited screen time the monster isn't shown to move very much. Whenever we see it kill it is in a very static situation, and in one of the final scenes in which Ripley flushes the alien I still have yet to figure out what the thing is actually doing. Is it hiding, resting, injured? I am not sure on the decision regarding the static nature of the entity. Not sure if it was a 'Jaws' situation and things just weren't working so they improvised or if this was always the way it was meant to be. I just think a bit more movement on the alien's part could have added a lot. That aside though I think this is near a perfect movie. Coming off the heels of Star Wars Scott made his own unique science fiction vision and created a classic to rival Lucas' for much different reasons. This is easily one of my favorite movies of all time.... Well, like, top 50 let's say.

461,3 February 2015,brianberta,9, A classic sci-fi movie with a terrifying monster,"Ridley Scott delivers a movie that combines horror and sci-fi in such a way making it into a terrific classic film. The movie centers around a group of people answering a distress signal from a planet only to have an alien make it onto the ship and they have to kill it before it kills them. As soon as the Alien makes it on their ship, the film provides a tense ride as the crew is offed one by one. The acting was fine on all parts and the cgi was pretty good for the time. This might get boring for some people but fans of sci-fi and horror will most likely enjoy the film. Director Ridley Scott did a great job setting up a plausible environment. It is pretty realistic and it didn't take the path that most horror movies nowadays take. The lighting and camera effects make the alien look like one of the most terrifying cgi monsters of the decade. This movie took the original alien movie formula that most movies of the 50's and 60's took and spiced it up adding new elements. It takes a simple plot and it turns it into a masterpiece. If you are a fan of sci-fi and horror then this movie is for you. It's one of the best horror films ever made.",

This was perhaps the first time all the way through since I missed it in the theaters (I was a newlywed and still in college...no money for movie tickets back then!). I am very impressed with how well this film has stood up over the years. The plot, while basic, does hold the attention of the audience. The acting is superb across the board and each of the actors makes the most out of the roles and clearly differentiates the characters. The special effects are very effective, even though they don't stack up to Star Wars or Close Encounters due to the film's limited budget. It is actually a very good thing that Ridley Scott did not attempt to make the same type of special-effects movie, since the plot, acting, and directing clearly carry the movie without it. In fact, this movie is much better than most movies that rely heavily on special effects, especially those cgi-heavy offerings such as The Hulk, The Matrix, and The Day After that offer nothing but special effects.",

I had to go. The movie that started this series of films. Iam glad to find out that the film has not really lost anything, considering it came out in 1979. Why is it so good? In my opinion, it has everything that a top horror movie should have. 1. The actors are brilliantly cast and portray different reactions and behaviors when people are put under pressure and exposed to the worst imaginable strains. Anxiety, unrest, anger - played out. Friendship and cooperation are put to the test. 2. The story is carefully built up. Here are no big action scenes, or spectacular stunts. Only the story-line that is so well portrayed and the anxiety we, the audience feel too, when we watch the movie. 3) The film is undoubtedly groundbreaking, with her female heroine taking on the role of leader under strong pressure. I once read that Alfred Hitcock had said that: The audience likes to be scared. It fits very well and is probably the explanation that this movie has become a classic. For all young people who have not seen it, see it!!. And ask their local movie club to set it up at the cinema, so you'll see how a movie masterpiece is and experience watching a top horror movie, which you'll won't soon forget.",
467,9 March 2005,jboothmillard,10, Alien,"Director Sir Ridley Scott here creates one of the best science-fiction films ever made, with some horror, action and thriller moments thrown in. Basically, the commercial towing vehicle, Nostromo, is heading back to Earth, when they receive an SOS signal from a nearby planet, and they are under obligation to investigate. They have a bad landing, but three of the crew members, Dallas (Tom Skeritt), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) and Kane (BAFTA nominated John Hurt) leave the ship to investigate. There they discover a hive colony of unknown creatures, the computer message was not an SOS, it was a warning. One of the eggs is disturbed, and a parasite (face hugger) attacks and attaches itself to Kane's face. Dallas and Ash (Sir Ian Holm) do try to get it off, but its defense mechanism of acid for blood and the possibility of killing Kane (because it is feeding him oxygen) stops them. Soon though, he seems fine and this creature has detached and died. The pinnacle scene is where all the crew have dinner, and Kane starts coughing and struggling in pain, till his stomach suddenly gushes blood, and the alien (or Xenomorph) is born (looking pretty phallic). It grows very quickly, and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) is first to be attacked by the big, double-mouthed, acid dribbling alien. The crew plan to kill the creature and escape in the shuttle, and one by one die trying to find it. Ash also grossly reveals himself to be a android with the ""special order"" to bring this alien to Earth for scientific discovery. Eventually the other crew members, Lambert and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) are killed, till the commanding officer, Ripley (BAFTA nominated Sigoureny Weaver) (who grew a bigger character as everyone else died) is the lone survivor, along with cat Jones, and sets the Nostromo to self destruct and escapes in the shuttle. The alien was not destroyed though, but eventually she gets it out of the blast door, sucked into outer space, and blasted by the shuttle rockets. She concludes by making a report of the situation, with hope she will be picked up by the company, and she and Jones go into the pod for hibernation. I have also seen the 2003 Director's Cut version, but the only real major change is seeing Dallas cocooned, and a few chats, and many interesting scenes and moments cut out, I think the original version is much more interesting and essential. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, it won the BAFTAs for Best Production Design and Best Sound Track, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Jerry Goldsmith, Best Costume Design and Best Editing, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Sigourney Weaver was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, John Hurt was number 27 on The 100 Greatest British Actors, Ellen Ripley was number 8 (Hero) and The Alien number 14 (Villain) on 100 Years, 100 Heroes and Villains, the film was number 6 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, it was number 11 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, and it was number 36 on The 100 Greatest Films.

468,14 January 1999,presence,10, One of the greatest horror movies of all time.,"Alien was an absolutely brilliantly filmed movie.  Ridley Scott really knew how to create an atmosphere suitable for this movie. The Nostromo was totally desolate, with long hallways and empty rooms.  The music and sound is very quiet, which is perfect for creating suspense and horror.  What really stands out from this movie however, is the Alien itself.

470,4 October 2011,parkergolding,10," An intelligent, deliberately paced exercise in fear","Alien is a most difficult film to define. In one sense it's a sci-fi film, in another it's a Gothic horror film. Ridley Scott's vision of the future was so intriguing at the time due to its modest implications. The usual sense of humans as infinitesimal in contrast with their universe is there, as is the feeling that one could be engulfed without incident. But for all its cosmic commonalities; Alien is grounded in a sense of realism. This is indicated by the Nostromo, a space Junker operated by eight ragtag crewman, which is a remnant of heavy industry and mass production that is void of the futuristic sheen of fictionalised ships such as the Enterprise, or the Millennium Falcon. Moreover, the crew is representative of the working middle-class; a humble collection of eight crewman whose expertise lies within the most basic provisions of engineering, spare two scientists, these people are the everyday collection that make up our society. Which is why Alien is an exemplary horror film: it deals with ordinary people under extraordinary circumstances ‚Äì its sci-fi trappings notwithstanding. ",

Of course the stand-out performance comes from, the quite young at the time, Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. In a role she was to make her own she was a little raw, but you could see the quality there. Next up (for me) was Ian Holm as Ash; he played what must have been a difficult part very well. Yaphet Kotto as Parker and Harry Dean Stanton as Brett played the blue collar grunts very well, and also provided some much needed comic relief here and there. Tom Skerritt did OK as Dallas, although I felt it wasn't a particularly demanding role. Veronica Cartwright did a decent job as Lambert and John Hurt, who has one of the most iconic scenes in sci-fi film history, played it with great aplomb.

473,1 May 2017,funeralfortheliving,10, Beware of the Mummy's Curse,"Ridley Scott made one of the best Mummy movies ever made in 1979's Alien. It takes from the myths and reality of the spread of germs accumulated in a sealed up tomb perceived by ancient societies as ""Curses"" and turns them into art inspired by truth. Just like in any Mummy movie it begins with humans finding ancient technology. In the same way some pyramids served as tombs you will notice in Alien the Space Jockey is a perfectly mummified being. People who have researched Giger's inspiration for the Jockey found he designed it off an ark type hieroglyphic that represented a vessel to carry one into the afterlife. Also the function of a Mummy. In ancient times when people would break into tombs they would immediately enter and be exposed to germs that could kill a person. This was the foundation for the Mummy's curse. Alien's takes that concept and brings it into the far out and beyond our capability concepts of science fiction. Another word for germ is bug so it makes sense that the film makers choose a bug for the form of the alien creatures. You will notice that just like an airborne germ the alien is contracted by a face huger cleverly designed to resemble a breathing apparatus. Just like germs the face huger enters through the mouth and lays its egg in the hosts chest. This is why the creature goes in through a breathing apparatus and stops near the lungs and the creature that is born is called a chest burster. It is all metaphoric of the airborne germ in a freshly opened tomb. I had never thought about this before until I went on a spree of mummy films. No one else has pointed this out to my knowledge but it would be interesting to see if the film makers themselves explained it to anybody. It gives me a new take on the film, makes so much sense and establishes the creativity that went into this film and I felt I should share it with all film watchers so they can enjoy it too.

Amazing experience unfolded. I like space movies, sci-fi and a good thriller so this had my full attention. This movie just unravels so nicely and at the same time pulls you into the story line. Mysterious signal, deep outer space and an investigation by an inexperienced but knowledgeable team. From there, glue keeps you in your seat and eyes on the screen. One nice scene after another with intrigue and suspense presents itself. I remember when I first saw the Alien and how the idea of something that does what it does so well and humans have no defense just mesmerizes the viewer. Just when I thought that it was predictable and winding down, it literally burst into a second act more terrifying than the first! I wont reveal anymore because I want you to have the tension that makes you grip your seat and remind yourself to breath. Nicely done to all involved.

the length... I think that this problem doesn't affect everybody... some people will think I am wrong, and some will think I am correct...
I think that the first part of the movie is too long...
especially in 2021, when we used that movies starts much faster...
But don't get me wrong, as I said it's still an excellent movie, which you must see if you didn't already...
my recommendation: watch it at high volume, in a dark room...it's make it much more enjoyable!!",
486,4 September 2008,Jacques98,10," Really, what can I say? It's perfect. That's all.","When I first watched Alien I simply did not have the attention span to sit through it. That's the same story as pretty much every one-star review you'll ever read. They, and likewise I when I first watched it, watch the first hour and realize nothing has happened and turn it off. I remember saying, ""Who can open up a movie in such a boring way?"" But after turning it off after the first hour, I came back later and finished it up¬óand was amazed at the pure intensity of the last half hour. I didn't realize what I was supposed to realize in the first five minutes: everyone on this ship is already in a life-or-death situation. That is why it is called a survival horror movie. That's the pure genius of the slow opening. That's what I and all the people who think this movie is boring missed. Luckily, after finishing the last 30 minutes the first time I realized this and watched it again. And again.",

Alien is, to me, dull, dark, shock-horror, trying to scare you with sudden noises and camera turns.  I sat there waiting for something to happen for most of the film, mostly bored to tears. To me, the only purpose for Alien is as a set up for the far superior Aliens.",
488,27 May 2009,Quebec_Dragon,8, Chilling psychological sci-fi classic still great today,"Maybe not as powerful and surprising today because we've become used to that kind of film (becaused copied so many times) but back then it was very fresh and surely terrifying. The tempo is slow but it works in context and contributes to create suspense and intensify surprises. The atmosphere and visual design are great and still look fine in the 21st century (with a couple of exceptions: one being a particular ""head""). The premise of the film was like a B-movie but everything was done to make it a quality A-movie including the actors who play seriously without any ""camp"" factor. Sigourney Weaver, in her first movie role, created a standard for strong female heroes that was extremely rare in those days. The alien creature as designed by Giger was a stroke of nightmarish genius recognizable and memorable amongst all others. It was even more effective because it was glimpsed so quickly and infrequently. Alien and the sequel Aliens have influenced tons of films and video games afterwards, especially visually. It's certainly a classic in the sci-fi thriller genre and should be seen by everyone. How I wish I could have seen it back in its heyday, but then perhaps I would have been psychologically scarred forever by its chilling images ;-) ",
489,6 June 2013,geminiredblue,10, In Space...,"Space may still be the final frontier, but after seeing ALIEN, one can't help but reconsider discovering it. Far into the future, and far out into the reaches of deep space, workers on-board the NOSTROMO, a mining ship, are wakened out of cryogenic sleep because the ship's sensors have picked up a supposed SOS from a nearby planet. Amid the crew's bickering and complaints about ""fair wages,"" they decide to investigate. Upon setting down on the environmentally-torn planet, their ship sustains damage that requires them to stay put until repairs can be made. So a small team, headed by Kane (played by John Hurt) choose to explore the source of the SOS. And what they find is incredible, the remains of a downed spacecraft. Venturing inside, they find evidence of the ship's inhabitants, in particular a fossilized corpse in a chair with a gaping hole in its chest. Still going further into the ship, they find the hold full of what appear to be eggs. One opens up and something jumps out, attaching itself to Kane's face. Against the better judgment of Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver) the team is let back on-board the ship. And I won't tell you anymore, except that an alien is let loose on-board that proceeds to kill the crew. For those of you unfamiliar with ALIEN, I won't reveal one of the greatest and most graphic special effects in sci-fi history. Only to say, you'll never think of enjoying a relaxing meal around the dinner table quite the same way again. The film works so well because it's basically a haunted house set in deep space. As one by one, the various characters are forced to investigate darkened corridors, air shafts, the occasional weird noises and so forth. Everything from the lighting, use of shadows and darkness, to the unsettling sounds of the ship itself, lend to the mounting tension. So watch this and be prepared to scream. But if you're in space, don't expect anyone to hear you!",

493,15 February 2021,gedikreverdi,5, The alien itself is the best thing about Alien,"If you watch it for the first time in 2021, it may feel like a bit too cheesy even if you recognize the historic importance of such films. The crew in the space ship are having a shower, having a breakfast, sipping their coffee while smoking cigarette and chewing gums and everything, I mean will you watch your favorite tv show too? They landed on a planet and encountered an abandoned ship. He went down into a cave in the ship and found the eggs. When he touched, it hatched and the alien stuck on his face. It unstuck back in their ship and it impregnated another alien in him and it came out of him by the dinner table. Another one from the crew went to the cooling ducts to kill him but he got killed instead and that scene in the ducts was the scariest part. Then it turned out that ash was a robot sent to save life organism and when they chopped him, his head on the floor said they're expendable and he's assigned to bring life form back to the earth alive. The other two got killed when they were about to abandon the ship to explode it and kill the alien inside too. Ripley was the sole survivor. She managed to get on the capsule and detached it from the ship and the main ship exploded which looked funny in terms of visual effects and I am so glad that we've come so far and have modern films. Then she found out that the alien was with herself lying in the corner. She could get her out, opened the door and lost all the pressure but hey who cares it's zero logic and the alien floated in space probably because we couldn't see it. Then she survived with the cat and let the crew on the earth know about it. They have gravity in the ship, she opened the module at the end and the vacuum didn't just take her out and so on. I expected it to be more scientific at least in such very basic senses. It's a classic horror movie and I feel like I had to watch it and check it off my watchlist. And I'd not want to see ripley's butt crack in the end.",
494,11 November 2008,HelloTexas11,10, an incredible film,"I've lost track of how many times I've seen 'Alien.' Let's just say, a bunch. I never saw it in the theater, which I suppose is my one big regret in life. The first time I watched it was from a bootleg video print someone loaned me not long after the film came out. I remember standing in one spot in front of the TV, not moving for two hours until it was over. I didn't even realize I was standing the whole time. So yes, this is one of my all-time favorite movies, definitely in my personal top ten. Have the repeated viewings over the years diminished its appeal to me? Only slightly, if at all. I STILL see things in 'Alien' when I watch it now that I've never noticed before. This is Ridley Scott's masterwork and try as they might, none of the film's imitators have managed to duplicate its aura of silent menace and genuinely disturbing creepiness. While 'Alien' draws its inspiration from several earlier films and books, the way it merges them all together seems completely original. H.R. Giger's bizarre painting are of course a crucial component. The alien itself is wet, slimy, feral; it's as though the crew is trapped with an insane, rabid, murderous animal that they never get a good look at (and neither do we, until the very end.) Everything about it ties into our worst primal fears; of suffocating, of having something grow inside us, of being ripped apart, literally. All of this works beautifully in juxtaposition with the crew of the infected ship. They are not explorers, they are workers, as ordinary as any group you might find toiling at an industrial plant or oil refinery. They are tough in a weathered sort of way but not heroic in the typical sense. Through no fault of their own, the group never really understands what they're up against. To them, the common thought seems to be, ""this thing can't be THAT hard to get rid of,"" a defensive kind of self-delusion to stave off the increasing sense of fear and desperation as their number dwindles one by one. The characters all come across as very human, each with strong and weak points, and it's almost a game the audience plays trying to figure out which one he or she would behave like in such circumstances. Would you be stoic, like Dallas? Angry, like Parker? Scared witless, like Lambert? Or would you have the wherewithal to hold up till the end and somehow kill the alien, like Ripley? One can't help but get sucked into 'Alien' that way; it gets inside you and stays with you, long after the final images have faded from the screen.",

The movie is just as much horror as science fiction, which is done very well, as the focus is on suspense, atmosphere, jump scares, and excitement. The story is creative and interesting, with a lot of shocking plot points. The design of the alien, spacecrafts, and planet, as well as the music also helps the eerie mood. One of the only problems is that, though the performances are decent, the character's besides Ripley and Ash are kind of bland and uninteresting. Overall, I think this could be one of the best movies of both the horror and science fiction genre. I would highly recommend it to fans of both.",

People don't realize what a massive shock this film was and still will be for future generations not desensitized by hype that unfortunately makes certain people approach it with an arrogant ""give me your best shot"" attitude. This is a patient horror film, that will never be touched. Anyone who says it is overrated is in my opinion an ignorant snob trying to start fights for no reason. There is no way this film is overrated, there is nothing else like it and it will never be duplicated even though everything after it has tried. How can this movie be overrated when it set the standard for Sci/Fi horror? Name one movie that came after ALIEN that either took place in space or involved creatures from outer space that didn't in some way rip it off? I pity the poor bastard who forgets history and has spit on classic and original films just to make a name for themselves. Alien is not overrated, and anyone says so will only end up exposing themselves as an ignorant fraud who knows nothing of greatness. It is easy to arrogantly claim that this film is overrated, and there will be many more cynical bitter fools to follow, but none of them will ever in their entire lives be anything more than an ignorant snob pissing on greatness just to be heard.

Alien shows a a bleak picture of the future and plays on a spaceship that Tons of crude oil transported . When they receive the signal , and obviously need to look into the matter , they fly closer to the Planet . The planet is dark and cold. Unlike other sci- fi Films ( like Star Wars ) here you see a planet , which is completely absorbed in the darkness, what the atmosphere even uncanny designed . Entering the planet is already the highlight of the first half hour . creepy sounds are always listening . The researchers squad is afraid ( At least a part of the crew , the other Part thinks only about profit and bonuses ) . in the background you can see the Star of the system , which has so nothing in common with our sun. it is further away and appears on the dark planet blue (still more scary ) . The camera shakes ( in the rest of the film also awesome) while looking at the alien ship. In the ship. The hallways are dark and wet. Hr Giger and the rest of the film crew have excellent Work done in the field of stage design. Really is not a reveal what they now find , just lots of alien technology . as Kane is attacked in the ""basement"" of the egg ( perfect horror scene) you can see first time the face-hugger . The closest point , which this film makes perfectly , is how the crew is responding the ""Face Hugger "". slowly trying to remove it. The idea and the design of the aliens is simply excellent. The acid, out snapping jaws and then the Chest Buster ( Schockmoment! ! ) . The scenes on the ship , so seen as the second half of the film have nothing in common with Star Wars . the Half of the courses are underexposed and narrow. Because no one knows where the Alien now infected, and which strategy it pursued , you can feel this uneasy feeling of claustrophobia. The finale brings this film satisfactory to an end and the action then remains open. For Score: Jerry Goldsmith has done a fantastic job . In my opinion according to the best of his soundtracks. With only two tones it produces so more tension as the Man of Steel in the complete movie. the Ideas are simply awesome. The action is varied and well thought out. Acting leaves nothing to be desired here . On the subject Voltage I need to say anything more surely . The film is convincing in all categories.",

They bring him aboard the ship and in a exquisitely terrifying scene the alien is born and gets loose upon the ship. It begins to grow as it feeds and soon comes fater the remaining cast members.

The details were fantastic, the lighting was very good-looking, and the aliens' looks and movements looked close to realistic. The first half was great! I think it was smart of the production to make the pace of the movie quite slow, and just slowly reveal the aliens step by step. Anyway, I was a little disappointed by the second half. After the death of Joan Marie Lambert and Dennis Monroe Parker, I just lost my interest. The rest of the movie became a usual and a bland hide and seek-movie, except from when Lt.

Shadows and light play together to make the viewer's eyes dart around the screen trying to catch a glimpse of where the wicked predator may be, like some sinister game of Where's Wally. You will jump every time you watch it. There are four horror movies that everyone must watch before they die. All have flawless acting. Flawless directing. Flawless script.

So, two decades after the event, we have four films in an ongoing series charting the adventures of ill-fated warrant officer Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who seems to be far more indestructible than her murderous rivals. The first of the quartet is a delirious fevered dream ride through the imagination of a fine director and an unrivalled designer. As Alien 5 gears up, give this another look if you get the chance.

An alien latches onto one of the spacecraft's members face and seems to infect him some way. When he gives ""birth"" to an alien the entire ship is in danger of suffering a similar fate. This movie is directed by Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) and stars Sigourney Waved (Ghostbusters), Tom Skerritt (Top Gun), John Hurt (Hellboy), Yaphet Kotto (The Running Man) and Ian Holm (The Lord of the Rings). The casting in this is so good and the characters are well written and executed. The dialogue from the beginning to the end of the movie is perfect. The special effects for 1979 are especially good. The facehugger scene to start the movie really drives the frantic feel you get throughout the film. The alien and final battle versus Ripley with the strobe light behind it is horror movie magic.

Ridley Scott made a film for the ages that sprouted many sequels and a whole industry in itself but it is nice to see how simple the first film is executed. Alien is a perfect example of a director gradually elevating the level of energy and anticipation in a motion picture. The way Scott meticulously raises the sense of menace and tension is worthy of Hitchcock. This atmosphere-soaked production relies on the viewer's imagination to enhance the alien's nightmarishness. Scott carefully restricts how much we see of the creature - there's enough to provide our minds with horrifying images, but not so much that the illusion is spoiled. Alien contains its fair share of genuine scares. These aren't mere ""boo"" moments, where something benign jumps out of the shadows accompanied by a loud noise and a musical crescendo, but legitimate shocks. The first occurs when the face-hugger leaps out of the egg and attaches itself to Kane. The second is when the alien explodes through Kane's chest.

The film starts without an introduction so you don't know in which year the astronauts are for what reason in space. The rest of the movie is quite boring, sometimes Jerry Goldsmith's make some themes exciting by using appropriate music. The rest of Jerry Goldsmith's score is not bad but also not above average.

None of this to boldly go where no one has before. It is strictly a commercial vessel, traveling to planets to receive mining cargo and then returning to Earth and the USA. Pilot Dallas (Tom Skerrit) has a crew of seven, including engineers to make repairs if the ship is damaged. They are at present going back to Earth with their booty and, as it is a long journey, the crew is sleeping in hibernation. Suddenly there is a change. Mother the computer wakes them and they amble to breakfast as they believe they are almost home. But, no, they are only halfway there. They were awakened because Interstellar space law demands them to investigate if another ship sends an SOS. On a nearby planet, a signal is registered. Reluctantly, Dallas and 2 other crew members suit up after a rocky landing, to locate the distressed party. In a cave, the trio finds a long deceased pilot but other living organisms. Without warning, one such small creature attaches to crew member Kane's face, breaking his glass helmet in the process. At once, the 3 return to the ship to try to save his life. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) third in command refuses to let them in, as protocol demands foreign substances from contaminating the ship. She is overridden when science officer Ash opens the doors himself. Now, Kane goes to the infirmary where he is still breathing but the organism cannot be cut off. Eventually, the creature falls away itself, dead. Kane seems OK. They have a meal before going back to sleep. But, horrors, the meal is cut short when a new alien tears through Kane's chest, killing him and still small, running away. Away from the rest, the alien grows and grows. Suddenly the now HUGE RAZOR TOOTHED ALIEN starts attacking the crew. Will they be able to destroy it or will it destroy them? This fantastic film stands the time test and remains a thriller of epic proportions. The sets are a technological wonder and the story is riveting. Weaver, in her first big role, is one gutsy heroine who uses all of her powers to fight back. As for the Alien, it is scary to the max!

Sigourney Weaver is the stand out in the cast of course as Ripley the tough heroine who finds herself in one dangerous situation after another when a nightmarish alien beast begins to pick off her crew members on board a mining ship in deep space. Tom Skerritt is good as Dallas but he lacks screen time because his role is cut rather short. The rest of the cast are solid in their roles including Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, and Yaphet Kotto but most of them like Skerriit aren't really in that much. The special effects are amazing especially for that time and the alien looks terrifying like something out of your worst nightmares. The movie did a claustrophobic feel because of the confined space the characters were in because of the ship and there was a decent amount of suspense. The movie was a little slow in the beginning but once things kicked into high gear suspense wise it moves at a steady pace from there.

Gigantic landing gear dwarfs the puny astronauts as they disembark from their ship and the misty, storm-ravaged surface of the planet is about as inhospitable an environment as anything theretofore presented in a science fiction fright film. Tracing the mysterious signal (a warning) to its source, they enter an alien ship through a giant orifice that lends the film a subtle, adult edge not normally found (up to that time) in such films. The fossilized giant was likewise unique for its time. I could go on, but I logged on to comment on ALIEN, the PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES remake (though it was never credited on screen as such). Borrowing also from IT!, THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE, FIEND WITHOUT A FACE and David Cronenberg's THEY CAME FROM WITHIN (a.k.a. SHIVERS), writer Dan O'Bannon and director Ridley Scott remade PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES without the vampires but with a terrifying new creature courtesy of Hans Rudi Giger. The Alien itself stands alongside THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON as one of the greatest costumes ever conceived for a fright film.

580,28 December 2003,hung_fao_tweeze,10, A cut above the rest,"There are so many reasons to love this movie. I saw it on the big screen back in '79 and was in awe. This movie doesn't even attempt to meet you with explanations for every squeak, squawk, or line uttered unintelligibly. It remains mysterious and tense throughout. You never even get a really clear look at the creature (a la 'The Thing From Another World'). On the other hand you don't feel disappointed that you never get a clear look. The tension, anxiety and claustrophobia settles right into your gut and stays throughout the pic thus satisfying what you originally came to the movie for in the first place. Giger's creature is art and apparently began a whole industry of look-a-likes. But this is the original and best in my book. I thought the sequels were great as well but Scott's direction conveys an oppressive atmosphere not present in the sequels. This puts it at a certain pinnacle the others didn't quite reach. Let's run through the accolades - shall we? The acting is top-notch and quite believable. The sound track - or frequent lack thereof - maintains the dread very adequately. The special effects are still good. The camera work is precise in every scene. And the pacing never lets up. You worry about what's around the corner with every scene.

It started in a quiet and darkened house, my aunt and uncles home in Hilton Head. It was very late and my family was asleep, except for my aunt and uncle. They were downstairs in a little family den, with a television the size of a cardboard box. They were watching ALIEN. I don't recall ""how"" it happened, but at some point late in the night I couldn't sleep and decided to get up. I headed out of the bedroom that I stayed in; it was a room shared with my sister and parents. Across the way in the loft was another bedroom where my grandparents slept. Downstairs I headed. The next moment was filled with so much terror I cannot even remember how it all unfolded. Just that I had walked in on the exact moment that John Hurts character (Kane) begins to wither down in agony and pain, falling onto the table beginning to convulse and frail around like he's having a seizure, only he's not. It's worse. The unthinkable happens. Sheer horror is in everyone's eyes as they bear witness to what is unfolding. After a moment of flailing it happens, and his insides burst open to have a small hostile and malicious creature come from his inners. Blood is splattered into Veronica Cartwrights character (Lambert) face as she responds with a reaction as real and raw as can be. With an overwhelming sense of dread and shock we all just sit and stand there; just like I did as a child. And alas,",

583,2 May 2006,eamon-hennedy,10, A welcome slice of dark sci-fi.,"For me, Ridley Scott's Alien is one of the most perfect pieces of cinema, not only with regards to its genre, or genre hybridization, in this case sci-fi and horror, but also one of the finest films ever made. Unlike the fairy tale world of Star Wars (which I like I have to say), or the philosophical and mythological world of The Matrix (which I love, it is my favourite movie series I have to say), Alien is something of a rarity, a science fiction movie set in a world that is almost realistic and authentic. Of course the movie hinges of an extra terrestrial, a space ship, a strange planet and all manners of grisly deaths, but what makes the film so good is how the film feels real because director Ridley Scott and screenwriters Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shussett have set their thrill packed horror spectacular in a future world that feel real. Their main characters are not soldiers or quasi-religious figures, they are merely futuristic equivalents of truck drivers, carrying their cargo not from city to city but from planet to planet. It is this kind of creation of character and mise en scene within the film that gives it its charm, in a manner of speaking.",

585,30 August 2020,vicrknudsen,10, Horror at its finest,"I define ""Alien"" as one of the finest, best, and unique films ever crafted. Not only does it hold up even after 40 years, but it is also a film I like to go back to and rewatch the incredible work of Ridley Scott. Where ""Alien"" strikes best is at its simplicity, yet the great and undoubtedly amazing narrative storyline is well-constructed and brimming with superb characters.
""Alien"" takes place onboard a transport spaceship, where eight passengers are present. They receive a distant call from an unknown planet and are obligated to explore the source of the transmission. Only to find themselves trapped among hundreds of egg-like objects. One of the crew members gets attacked by a strange creature, and it's now up for the rest of the crew to get to safety as well as dealing with their morality and jobs. Is it right to bring the whole crew in danger to save a man's life? This is the beginning of a blood-gushing, chilling space-adventure that changed sci-fi and got a legendary status among film fans. I have probably seen ""Alien"" around five times now. Even though it is not one of the most-watched films of mine, I still feel like this is one of my favorites. It has all the things I require a film to have: strong characters, great script, incredible production design, and a haunting score. There are so many points I could pinout for this picture, so let me begin with some of the most important.
For quite some time I have looked at the direction of Ridley Scott. He has a very distinct yet clear way of telling his stories. He began his career back in the 60s where he made a few episodes for various television-series. His first feature film ""The Duellists"" came out in 1977, and scored Ridley a place among newcomers to look out for. A few years later he made ""Alien"" which was his first Hollywood production and which ended up scoring the then 42-year-old man a top spot as Hollywood hottest directors. His style for ""Alien"" can for some aspects recognized in his 1982 sci-fi film ""Blade Runner"" were the symbolic presence plays a huge part in the film. It does too in ""Alien"" and he is not afraid to use slow and steady camera movements, while the music takes over and the audience gets sucked into the outer space. Already from the first shot of the film (which is where all the title cards are seen), he uses this slow and still camera that pans around in space to give a feeling of emptiness and isolation. When it comes to the interior scenes in the claustrophobic hallways of the spaceship, he knows exactly how to build up tension and make horror out of small things.
Some might refer to ""Alien"" as ""Jaws"" in space, which is highly noticeable given that the Xenomorph rarely is seen in its full, and with the use of special effects and incredible lighting, the scenes work great. The sets are great-looking with all the small and narrow corners inside of the spaceship. On the planet, the sets that were built are breathtaking and look so believable that you're convinced that you're among these astronauts.
In the cast, we see some of the finest actors and actresses. From Harry Dean Stanton as Brett to Ian Holm as Ash, the work of talent is so huge in this film. Sigourney Weaver is cast perfectly as the lead of the film. She is the one we follow throughout the events, and she is the one we put our trust in right from the beginning. She plays her role as Ripley to perfection by giving her a lot of strength and will to stand up for herself and her beliefs. If Disney wants to create a great female lead for their next Marvel film, they should probably look for someone like her. John Hurt, Tom Skerritt, Yaphet Kotto, and Veronica Cartwright are all doing an amazing job in the film too.
I have for some reason only seen the 2003 Directors cut of ""Alien"" because I have been told it was the right version to see. I feel like it's the right one, even though I haven't seen the original. I adore this film, and I couldn't praise it enough. Many people believe ""Aliens"" is better than this one, but for now, I would disagree with those people. Nothing beats the original suspense film, as it is great entertainment and immortal horror.",

The movie does have a slow and steady pace and I can see where today's moviegoers might be bored with its long shots and dedication to convey the scale of its large space environments.

Many of the other actors' characters are terrific, and the first little alien's ""entrance"" is one of the slickest effects I have ever seen--you could almost feel John Hurt's pain.

The story however has much in common with ""The thing from another world"" (1951, Christian Nyby/Howard Hawks).

Tremendously paced & photographed by director Ridley Scott, keeping you on the edge of the seat till the very end.  Sigourney Weaver is not necessarily the star in this movie, she just happens to be the only survivor, and then goes on to be the star in the many sequels that follow. There are many well done things in this movie including the transition of the alien itself from the attached lifeform on John Hurt's character's face to the almost human-like appearance that it has near the end.   The story itself is simple but the characters are very down to earth and believable enough that you do care for them unlike some cheap horror movies where the characters are so stupid that you want them to die.  It is no doubt why the movie started a trend of these type of pictures because of it's obvious box-office appeal and the quality that was put into it.  It's successors of course do not come close to the type of all-around quality that is displayed in this picture.",
612,9 April 2017,davispittman,7, Pretty good but aliens is better,"Ridley Scott's Alien really is a good film, even though it's sequel Aliens (1986) is better.

The movie takes a little while to get itself going, I didn't really mind that when something interesting was going on, but there were a few parts in the beginning were I just wanted them to move it along. I don't mind taking a bit longer to get the film started just as long as you keep me fairly interested and entertained while you're building up to things. The acting is very impressive in the movie, of course Sigourney Weaver is spot on great like always. The other supporting actors are pretty good. The effects are very good for 1979! The special effects in this movie is MILES better and a lot more effective than in 1992's alien 3. The action scenes are filmed well, a couple of the killing scenes are similar to like a slasher/regular horror killing, but then others are incredibly original and creative. I think everyone who has heard of this movie knows what scene I'm speaking about. Yes, it involves a man's chest and an alien. That scene is oh so effective! Very well done shocking scene.

613,31 October 2020,fernandoschiavi,8," ""In space, no one can hear you scream"", perfectly synthesizing the mixture between terror and sci-fi","In the 1970s, science fiction cinema was at the height of exploration on the dangers of otherness (Immediate Third Degree Contacts, The Body Invaders), while the blockbuster took its first steps with Tubar√£o, four years earlier. Perhaps the new generations are unaware that at that time the films were not designed with the intention of becoming franchises, and actresses hitherto unknown (Sigourney Weaver) were easily cast for a production of this size. Original stories dominated a market prior to the standardization of reboots, prequels and spin-offs. In other words, we had a cinema used to taking risks.
Regarded as one of the greatest references of its genre, Ridley Scott's work is inspired by Greek and Egyptian mythologies, as well as little-known comics and several other varied sources. Over the years, the franchise has shown itself to be a gigantic and joint collaborative process. In the plot, a spaceship, upon returning to Earth, receives strange signals from an asteroid. While investigating the site, one of the crew is attacked by a strange being. What appeared to be an isolated attack turns into constant terror, as the attacked crew member took the embryo of an alien into the ship, which keeps growing and aims to kill the entire crew.",

615,24 July 2017,yourfavoritecritic,8, The Final Frontier,"Released in 1979 Alien marked one of the first blockbuster films for director Ridley Scott and the debut of actress, Sigourney Weaver. Alien tells the story of a crew travelling through space receiving a distress call from an unknown transmission and after deciding to land their craft near the source of the signal, they find themselves being hunted by a mysterious life-form who's lifecycle has just begun. There is not much to say about this movie which hasn't been said before, it is damn good. Alien very much reminds me of a cross between Star Trek and 2001: A Space Odyssey, both properties which have practically paved the way for science fiction entertainment. The world building in this film was nuts, I love the set up of the ship and inklings we get about what earth looks like at the time this movie takes place in. Alien's premise is very much set up to play on the fear of viewers and coming from a huge horror movie buff, I wasn't all that frightened by the sequences of horror which took place. Not to say those scenes in particular weren't scary, I just didn't personally like them all too much however I can see why people claim this film to be one of the scariest movies ever. Even though the horror element may not work, Ridley Scott really knows how to build up a scene, the intensity brought forth in some scenes is quite good. The creature in this film is a force of nature and though the design of it is cool, I was never frightened by it. The scariest parts of this film is not knowing exactly where it is and it is here where Scott really amps up the intensity, making the scenes which do not feature the alien more effective in its scariness. Now even though Ridley Scott does an excellent job directing this film, the actors and actresses in this film are equally as good. Sigourney Weaver, who was unknown at the time of filming, gave a damn good performance. It was awesome seeing such a strong female lead be able to take on and accomplish tasks that would otherwise require the assistance of another character. Having such a independent women for a character was quite uncommon for movies to do at the time, so all the props go to filmmakers involved for being so progressive. Now what really elevates this movie from being just good, to great, is its last fifteen minutes. There came a point in the movie where I thought the movie was wrapping up, the story over but then out of nowhere the movie hits you with another climax which is just so excellently done, I would re-watch the film solely for that third act. Overall I quite enjoyed Alien, and even though this was my first time seeing it, I do see the film growing on me. If you have not seen Alien, I would highly recommend you do so, it is a perfect example of great filmmaking back almost forty years ago that still holds up to this day, Alien gets a 8/10.",

The acting here was first-rate and flawless. They used big-name actors to fill the parts in this movie such as Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Harry Dean Stanton and John Hurt. The only person who I thought was very annoying and poorly played was Veronica Cartwright's character, Lambert. I wanted her to be killed so she would shut up. Everyone else was perfect though.

The best think I would say was the production value. There was little character development and the end was kind of anti-climatic. I would have liked to have seen the alien came after Ripley and have something a bit more exciting at the end besides the final jump at her. I really enjoyed the sound effects, but were used so much better in a Space Oddessy. I know I should not be comparing the two movies, but it happens. I have to say who ever was the production designer went well above and beyond. The cinematography was surprisingly rich considering the atmosphere. The one scene with Ripley coming down the later with the flame thrower was just great. The use of the strobe was nice and gave a sense of not knowing what the danger was. Ridley Scott really did create a whole new world with a lot of atmosphere and I look forward to seeing the next one again. I did not feel the suspense as much as I could have and the set of urgency was achieved at the end with the quick editing did not seem to pace well together. Oh one of my favorite things was how some of the shots were very dark and small and I wonder how another director with the current technology would imagine some of the shots. I have to give a lot of respect to Ridley Scott for doing a lot with a little (in terms of the current state of special effects).",

While I still believe ""Aliens"" is somewhat better, the sequel's final scene just cannot compare to the first one's. I'm sure you agree. If you don't, a reminder; *THIS IS ALL MY OPINION*. With that out of the way, let us start. First, just the way the movie STARTS is terrifyingly claustrophobic. We are meant to feel...that ""isolated from the world"" feeling. And it works very, very well. We are then introduced to the characters: Ellen Ripley, Ash, Kane, Brett, Parker, Dallas, and Lambert. These characters mostly do their part with the pretty great acting. Things are all nice and merry until one of the characters fatally get chest-bursted by one of the Aliens! The scene is one of my most beloved of all time(and for those who have seen the movie, I'm sure you agree as well). Of course, the Alien kills off each one of the characters until only Ripley is the only one left. I won't spoil the last scene, just in case there are idiots reading this who ignored the ""Warning: Spoilers!"" thing. Anyway, the design of the ship is FANTASTIC. Really this movie is nearly up there with ""Halloween"" as one of the greatest horror movies of all time. It has a perfect plot, alright pacing, and terrifying suspense.

I believe the main reason to this film be that high rated is the directing. Ridley Scott is marvelous; he is able to entertain, scare, shock and at the same time, give the spectator a good time. This film runs away from every possible clich√©-- which is a hard thing to see in a horror film. There are some shocking scenes, such as the alien coming out of Kane's body in dinner table. In fact, I don't believe in such thing as aliens, but still felt horrified in this scene, so I can imagine how scared alien believers must have felt. Sigourney Weaver is excellent in doing her job, I didn't know she was that good.

And,indeed,looking back on it now,how WOULDN'T a movie set in outer space that involves the following elements: a bleak,non-descript future,seven characters who are neither scientists nor space heroes/fighters and a sleek,nightmarish looking creature with awesome and unearthly traits(i.e. acid for blood,parasitic reproduction,an exponential growth rate among them),be a shock to audiences who were primarily used to more conventional forms of alien life(examples:The Day the Earth Stood Still,2001:A Space Odyssey,George Pal's War of the Worlds,Star Wars,Star Trek)or the future for that matter(again with Star Trek or 2001). Even in Howard HAwks' The Thing(remember,this is 1979,three years before John CArpenter envisioned the same movie),the killer creature seemed to take on a familiar face,even it was similarly lacking in mercy or reasoning as the creature in this movie. Approaching thirty years after its release,Alien still inspires imagery that is as wild and fantastic as it is horrific and sickening. ",

All this is true, but this movie is highly overrated. Much like Bladerunner, Scott's a great and innovative director that finds a really great niche that had been ignored for a few years, dust it off make it huge for half a second and that leads to a revival of said genre and then that genre because is popular again the film becomes old hat.

John Hurt is in this also, and there is a scene during lunch where the alien crawls out of his stomach. It's one of the nastiest things I have seen. The Alien films are horrifying. I don't want to talk about that scene though. I only have a few more things to say about this film. I love this movie and I prefer it over Predator. It's much scarier and cooler than Predator. Really, if I were getting chased by Alien or Predator I'd be scared. But I'd be more scared of the alien. Alien is a much scarier film, and it's one of the best in the series. Probably the best.",

I was interested to see ""Alien"" yet again because of the way Prometheus put the earlier movie into context.

655,27 July 1999,baumer,9," Not quite as good as Aliens, but still well done","I think Aliens owes a lot of it's success to the original but it is a film that stands on it's own.  Alien, however is a very terrifying film, it just takes a little while to get there.  What is very good about the original is that the set design is really one of the stars of the film.  Everything is meticulously laid out before us and this adds to the element of fear that Alien is famous for.  I have to say that Aliens scared me more that almost any other film ever made and although I personally find Alien to be very good, (but just a step under Cameron's version and vision) it has to be said that this movie is very frightening and it is extremely well made.  There is quite a bit of tension in here and it stars Tom Skerrit, that alone makes it worth the price of a rental.  I think this is the perfect predecessor to Aliens.  You should see this before you watch the second one.  They complement each other perfectly.  And if you skipped the last two all together, you would have a true feel of what good film making is all about. Alien is a very frightening film.",
656,3 March 2000,forebore-2,9, The best sci-fi/horror ... ever!,"With its many grisly special effects and truly suspenseful moments, Alien is sci-fi/horror at its best.

While investigating the ship, one of the crew members is infected with a deadly creature that proceeds to burst out of his body and kill off the other crew members one by one. This film is very original and imaginative. It also borrows much from classic 50s science fiction, especially The Thing. It's a very entertaining movie with a good story, even better directing, and one of the most horribly realistic special effects in film history. My favorite scene is when Tom Skerritt shines his flashlight into a darkened corridor only to find the creature inches away from his face. That is the only scene in my history of movie-watching that was both scary and unpredictable enough to make me leap out of my seat and scream.

R. Giger's psycho sexual, lovecraftian designs. The creature, diluted as it may be today, is still terrifying, inducing the subconscious fears of male rape into the audience. No detail in the ship is left undeveloped, and even if their characters aren't fully developed, the cast certainly give believable performances. Outstanding is Sigourney Weaver as lieutenant Ellen Ripley, one of the first action heroines in celluloid, and Ian Holm as Ash, the scientist and (spoiler) undercover android on board. Unlike most modern horror films, Alien dares to have an atmosphere: minutes pass without the soundtrack daring to alleviate the tension, until a jump scare or truly terrifying outburst of violence erupts. Despite little gore by today standards (the infamously brilliant chest burster scene aside), Alien outmatches them with hidden imagery of sex and death and a brief, yet all-to present allegory at human greed and the stretches corporation will breach for power and money.

We had no VHS copy at home so I had to wait 5 or 6 years to get a chance to view the movie again in Paris.

The imagery provides a good tone of suspense, especially H.R. Giger's immortal designs for the Alien itself.  These images are especially monstrous!

723,21 August 2020,andrewroy-04316,8," A pure, taut sci-fi horror to its bones","I feel similarly to Alien as I did to Mad Max: Fury Road. I can find very few flaws with either, and both are memorable because of how deeply they commit to their central premise and tone. There's no filler; each moment is tense and meaningful, and is in the style of the film at large. While Mad Max creates a pure, unadulterated action film, Alien is a pure, menacing sci-fi horror. The design of the alien is really well done and the sci-fi trappings as a whole are extremely intelligent - the characters seem like plausible candidates for the mission, and the systems are realistic. Scott never rushes the film, instead letting the audience marinate in the tense moments to make us share the tension and paranoia felt by the crew. It's a wonderfully well done sci-fi horror film, but I don't think those elements are the ones I most value in a film - I get more out of a thematically and symbolically rich film, or a fascinating brain burning mystery, than nervousness that a monster will come out and kill the characters, especially when it becomes abundantly clear that's what's going to happen. I deeply admire Scott for being uncompromising in his vision for the film, and he achieved it perfectly. It's a great movie, and anyone who enjoys sci-fi horror would love it.",

It is, in fact, an icon of horror science fiction, better than anything of its kind until that date (1979). Bad films are ignored, and this portrait of character has been anything but ignored. It is therefore by popular opinion a significant and memorable work of Gothic horror. Those who disapprove of Alien are generally eager for action horror, and this is not an action horror. Aliens (by James Cameron) was an action horror - a very different kind of movie. Alien 3 was a Gothic horror once more, but not even comparable in quality as Ridley Scott's vision. Alien Resurrection was an action horror, but not even comparable in quality as James Cameron's vision. ",

The ""heartbeat"" rhythm that plays throughout the film adds to the suspense, but not much. Not once did I gasp, jump, or even sit close to the edge of my seat. I watched this movie ten years ago, and forgot the entire thing. Very forgettable story, empty characters, only about ten minutes of the film do you get to even see the alien. I have not seen any of the sequels, perhaps they are better. I don't plan to find out. How is this film rated so high?

What I remember thinking the first time I saw this film, back in the 80s, is that it was boring. Well, that was a little unfair, but I was just thirteen or something like that and sitting through a movie like this wasn't exactly what I enjoyed. I enjoy ""Alien"" more now, but even though I don't find it boring anymore, I can't help but feel that it is nothing compared to James Cameron's ""Aliens"". For instance, ""Alien"" is not nearly as suspenseful as Cameron's film, the action sequences are lamer (can't blame Scott for that, though, since his film is seven years older than Cameron's), and generally much more happens in the sequel. I also feel that the chemistry between the actors in ""Aliens"" are better than in this film. Naturally, though, ""Alien"" is much better than David Fincher's third instalment in the series (and he went on to make ""Fight Club"", wow!) and also way better than the fourth instalment. In short: it is a good film, but as far as the series go, this is definitely one of those rare cases where the sequel is actually better than the first film!",

Scott is aware that the anticipation of fear is far more chilling than the actual fear itself, and this cardinal law defines his whole approach : Economy. We barely get a few glimpses of the creature, and even at the end we don't see it fully. The film's characters disregard good sense at every stage, and do everything to put themselves in harm's way for the benefit of the audience. The only thing that looks dated in this three-decade-old picture is the alien itself (although it is still a frightful beast). To miss the film's mind-boggling production design and photography would be a crime, even for those who dislike horror films (me!). The images of space owe their very existence to 2001.

The acting is fantastic with characters who have the same problems getting along with each other that we often do, and the same ""colorful"" language that keeps my wife from letting my kids watch this movie. The only flaws with the film is that the humans are sometimes a little stupid, staring and screaming at the alien instead of shooting it, and that our star risks her life for her stupid cat.

Everyone who loves this movie knows what I'm talking about. Ridley Scott had to be extremely careful not to show a full shot of the Alien, except in very brief scenes, and not to reveal exactly how it moves, because then we would see that it is just some tall, skinny guy in a rubber suit. Nowadays, some computer guy would whip up a really scary-looking, but nevertheless FAKE-looking (yes, computer guys, we can tell) Alien, and the director would not have to even think about trying to breathe life into H.R.

The plot is nothing revolutionary, and most of the characters are a little more than meat for the monster. It's the fortunate combination H. R. Giger's modern design and Ridley Scott's taut and precise direction that could elevate the Xenomorph to one of the most iconic monsters in history. Unlike its action-packed sequels, ""Alien"" focuses exclusively on slowly building up the tension with its dark and claustrophobic atmosphere, with endless silences and only measured appearances of the Xenomorph. Its appearances are sporadic and incredibly brief, but manage to create an increasing sense of anticipation and, at the same time, mask the limits of the special effects. A lot of the tensest moments actually happen when the Xenomorph is still off-screen. It's a Lovecraftian horror movie that plays on the psychological side, and that will not satisfy the ones looking for high-paced slasher carnages.",

In a star-making role, Sigourney Weaver excels as sole survivor Ripley, becoming the screen's most popular heroine in a lucrative movie franchise.

The really powerful thing about aliens is their ability to evolve and learn, and the parasitic hosts can absorb their strengths and become more powerful, constantly learning and adapting to their environment.

Every watch feels like a brand new experience where I'm once again faced with the terror of an unknown creature stalking in the dark. This movie presents itself in a dark, worn world that seems like a close, foreseeable future. While Star Wars tried to craft a similarly lived-in world two years earlier, the difference lies in the creator's view of human kind in the stars. Ridley Scott gives us a world where humanity's greed has spread across the galaxy, so that your average spaceship is an industrialized freighter. The horror that this movie accomplishes is tied to this dark atmosphere. These corporate hallways don't feel safe, they feel cold.

The Terror from Beyond Space', this 1979 blockbuster attempted to mingle together science-fiction and horror, two of the most popular genres of its time, in a more sophisticated manner than those primitive '50s pictures. It also tried to emulate the style and success of 'Star Wars' and 'Jaws', which were the two biggest money-makers in the box office at the time.

Unfortunately i wasn't born in that decade, so i couldn't see anyone of these movies, i've only seen them on the small screen. One of my favorite movies of all time was Jaws, and i still think that that movie deserves the title of ""best scary movie of the 70's"". But, after lately seeing Alien, which many people have told me was a good movie, i think it is a good runner-up. I actually had seen Aliens, the sequel first, which was good. Although, after seeing this one, that movie looks much worse. While Aliens was okay, good, Alien is excellent, great! I know that many people think exactly the opposite, but these people are definitely wrong. It also shows because Alien is actually listed higher in the top 250. Alien was definitely scarier, while Aliens is more of an action/war flick. It was also far too loud and dumb and the action would often get boring.

They must escape from the spaceship before its too late. The Alien fights them every step of the way. This movie was a little slow paced, but still well made.

Long duration scenes, chilling silence, neat characterization, haunting back ground score, few surprising twists and state of the art special effects. All these convert a conventional looking survival story into a magnetic thriller. It is termed as sci-fi but I would say there is less science and more fiction here. Sigourney Weaver who have acted in all alien movies is the leading lady here and does the fantastic job in making the character worth rooting for. But all credit goes to Ridley Scott for clean and sure footed direction and the special effects team for the work that does not seem dated even after 30 years. Must watch for sci-fi or horror cum thriller lovers.",
798,21 March 2013,JohnWelles,9, Acid Trip,"Alien (1979) is a science fiction classic that is strangely unoriginal. The ""used future"" idea that is so central to the movie's success was used before in scriptwriter's Dan O'Bannon's own Dark Star (1974) and in George Lucas' Star Wars and not only that, but the plot is a crossbreeding of The Thing (1951) - the dark prowling search for the monster through underlit corridors - and It! the Terror from Beyond Space - the actual plot of the alien running amok through the spaceship. Having read Dan O'Bannon's original screenplay (with a co-story credit for Ronald Shusett), it's easy to see why studios were reluctant to pick it up: one dimensional characters, a very simple, linear story progression, an alien that looks like a chicken. It is promising script that could turn into a good film. Yet is this hindsight, knowing what would come from it? When Walter Hill's company Brandywine bought it, they immeasurably improved the characters, removed a lot of unnecessary to-ing and fro-ing, crucially added the android Ash to add another layer of complexity to an otherwise too simple story and, at the suggestion of (possibly) Twentieth Century Fox head Alan Ladd Jr., turned Ripley into a woman. O'Bannon provided the bones, Hill along with David Giler, added the meat. However, no script credit for them, due to a series of falling-outs with O'Bannon and the W.G.A. ruling (wrongly in my view) in favour of sole credit for O'Bannon. However, we still have a remarkably derivative script; no magic here.",
799,13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,9, One Alien Is Plenty,"The Alien saga began with the best one, when there was only one Alien to be seen. The simplicity of the story is the key. One Alien, one claustrophobic ship, and 7 crew-members are the entire cast of this 1979 thriller. Directed by Ridley Scott, Alien has a sense of unease, a fear of what will happen next. The setup to the movie is wonderful, scary looking beings that we have never seen before invade our minds, we only catch quick looks off the actual being, mostly when it's young and popping out of John Hurt's stomach, in the most gruesome, yet famous scene of the movie. Sigorney Weaver plays Ripley, a rare female hero in a science fiction movie. She is a strong character, one cunning enough to ultimately defeat the Alien creature at the end of the movie. But the most important part of the movie is the suspense, mostly in what we don't see. As I said, we do not see much of the actual Alien creature. In the most tension filled scene, the Alien is not seen, just a dot on a computer screen chasing down another dot is all that gets the audience to fear it. Dark, claustrophobic, and selective of what we see, Scott does a great job of giving the audience what he wants us to see, not everything we need to see. The simplicity in the story is what makes it a gem.",

What inst cool about this movie? I think some scenes drag on a bit too much, that ain't cool. I really dislike the main score to this film, i don't know why ... but i find it rather UNcool. It has a VERY odd build up, i think that they could have made it a lot scarier, once the alien starts terrorizing the crew it falls rather short. Which isn't cool.

I have seen it many times since, and am watching it now (Sept 2019), a full 40 YEARS later. Even after a significant science-based education and seeing many Sci-Fi films over the years, I am amazed at the realism and sense of horror and fear that it still conveys, even despite its age. The technology and special effects still appear current and up to date, and the acting is superb.

To be honest I didn't know what to expect since I had heard some pretty mixed reviews. I not only loved Alien but it would also take up quite a high spot on my top 100 movies list. It was chilling, well written and masterfully directed by Ridley Scott. There are several scenes that still send a shiver down my spine no matter how many times I watch it, for instance the scene in which the alien comes out of John Hurt. Sigourney Weaver never looked sexier. Since then I have made it my mission to view Ridley Scott's other work which I hadn't seen before.

And who could ever forget the creature, created with costuming and puppetry with grace unparalleled for sheer terror especially the crew members most unfortunate to encounter it.

819,3 December 2002,Rforey,3, Analysis of Alien,"The worst part of ALIEN has got to be the appallingly pretentious Freudian psychoanalytical interpretation of the film put forth by Barbara Creed in The Monstrous-Feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis (London, 1993).  The assumption that the fear produced by ALIEN is based upon the fear of the castrating archaic mother is so general it fails to carry any weight.  While instances of maternal separation are seen (the Alien bursts through Kane's body) and the notion of individuality being achieved by these means is an interesting one, the attribution of Freudian philosophy to this film as a whole is a stretch to say the least.  How can one argue against such a sweeping analysis when all other arguments are countered with subconscious motivation?!  The unconscious argument assumes that society as a whole maintains the same subconscious interpretation, a fact I find very hard to believe.  It would also imply some sort of unlevelled genius in the film making process who could transcend consciousness and develop a conscious idea into a subconscious response - again, doubtful on such a scale. Creed's approach also fails to take into account filmic industrial history and the audience's interpretation of the movie.",

Alien is about a ensemble of people returning to earth, and that is where the conflict arrives, they have been awoken from hypersleep to check out this new planet which they believe to have life of it. They will son find out if it does or not. Siqurney Weaver is absolutely perfect for the part of 'RIPLEY' because she is tough, strong and very agile. ALIEN deserves 10/10",

Not to omit, this is 1979, a great deal of work has put into this movie.
Remarkable scene decor and fantastic designs of the ship, rooms, vessels, equipment and the planet(!). I loved everything about this movie regarding the set. Panavision, indeed, has done a great job providing the crew with space to be creative, and what an incredible job by the crew!
Well-desereved award winning movie, transfers us into a commercial spaceship and then will let us alone in the dark space, experimenting with our survival instincts.
8 years later oscar nominee Sigourney Weaver, who played the leading actress, to me was rigid, forced and a bit artificial in her role. Her character, however, is particularily a favorite of mine, following rules and taking control when necessary, judging others and a deep suspicion that is just fit for her. Adequetly brave, as in not adventurous enough to take unnecessary risks, but brave enough to push her limits. While I get the shuttle scene where she's in her revealing top and the smallest panties they could find for her, indicating a finally-achieved moment of redemption, I don't get the necessity for the small panty!

That hadn't happened to me since I had seen a re-issue of ""Psycho"" (1960) in a drive-in. ""Alien"" may have been inspired by the B & W mini-classic ""It! The Terror From Beyond Space!"" (1958), ""Planet of the Vampires"" (1965), even ""Queen of Blood"" (1966). The film's terror follows a scene where an astronaut (John Hurt) is infected with an alien organism after a crew of 7 touch down on a planet to investigate a distress signal. What follows will take your breath away, (and leave your eyes semi-closed) with shocking, supremely suspenseful set-pieces, marvelous Ridley Scott direction, authentic-appearing sets, eerie music, an ever-evolving, terrifying Alien costume and superb ensemble playing by the rest of the cast: Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto, and an expressive orange tabby cat. It turned movie conventions upside down. I believe modern audiences may not realize the significance of billing in vintage films and print ads. Check the haunting main titles: Skerritt (plays the ship's Captain so he should make it) and Weaver are first credited so we expect these 2 attractive actors to survive. Also the credit is ""And Yaphet Kotto as Parker""; could he be the last one? A mid film incident turns everything asunder, jarring the audience. The fact is the last survivors are the Black man, two women, and the cat. Thus far, the alien kills one person at a time, so when Ripley is readying the shuttle while Parker and Lambert load more supplies, we might believe she is next. Also, the last act features a blowing up of the spaceship so now the credits will roll, or will they? The billing and, in turn, subsequent events mean ANYONE can be a casualty - utterly unexpected and brilliant. Followed by three decreasingly effective sequels (so far).",

The part where they exchange the robot head for the human one, was a total laugh. Also, watching it in 2012 and noticing the poorly done effects definitely lowers the vote. If you watch Star Wars, for example, today, you still can be amazed by those incredible special effects, done around the same time (1977) and with less money.

The cast is great with Sigourney Weaver playing what is possibly the most awesome female protagonist in cinema.
The film is very suspenseful to say the least and very claustrophobic too.
The special effects are amazing and the imagery and the set designs are some of the things that makes this film so unforgettable, I mean how could you forget that big cannon looking thing with a weird elephant man (that I'm pretty sure it's revealed to be an Engineer in Prometheus) with a hole in his chest. The Xenomorph is arguably the best looking alien creature to ever come out of any film and the same goes for the spaceship. And finnaly the themes of sexual violence and rape (for example the way the facehugger forces himself onto Kane or how the Xenomorph suggestively moves his tail when killing Lambert) are another reason why this film an icon of pop culture.

From the casting of a hitherto unknown Sigourney Weaver, to the other equally fantastic cast members (the best of both American and British), this is truly a movie without equal in the genre. It is timeless and never gets old, no doubt due to the art background of Scott, who began his career as a set designer.

The film's plot is nothing new or revolutionary in and of it's self (the crew of a spacecraft is trapped onboard with a carnivorous alien who picks them off one by one), but Scott and screenwriter Dan O'Bannon wisely downplay the typical genre gimmickry in favor of a deceptively straightforward narrative. In fact, the film actually plays more like a psychological cat-and-mouse thriller than a routine space adventure, although the spacecraft setting lends the suspense a brilliantly claustrophobic atmosphere that possibly could not have been duplicated with an earth-bound setting.

Now i know, this movie was from 1979 so back then movies didnt really have the time to make this movie like michael myers where the alien kills people in gory brutal ways, now that would has been amazing. I feel like this movie could have been way more than it was. There was absolutley no blood whatsoever except the chest burster scene and the whole entire movie was not scary one bit. Like i said i love the movies everyone hates so that means i hate the movies people love, but i dont necessarily hat this film, i mean the quality of the film was like modern day films so i have no idea how that worked out. That is kinda the only thing good about this film. I mean halloween came around that time and the quality on the fims was terrible compared to this. Anyway i am quite confused on how people could like this. When i saw it with my parents they hated it. Now i dont hate any movie in existence i just like some more than others.

I bought the whole Alien quadrilogy pack on Blu-Ray and I was impressed how great it looks, I say if you go to Target or Walmart and find it then buy it. My favorite part of this movie is the claustrophobic environment, it isn't like the crew could walk outside the ship so they were trapped.

Like all classics, to be viewed by future generations, it cannot remain in a time warp, never to be compared to the future films it inspired or spawned. As my sons watched this movie, they cringed at the special and visual effects, and matte paintings, that for our generation were indistinguishable from a real life, massive set (the artists won Oscars for these masterpiece effects). But for today's generation, the special, visual, and model effects are readily distinguishable, and effectively destroy the film's illusion.

887,27 October 2017,justinpkelly,9, A Horror Masterpiece,"In space, no one will hear you creep downstairs to watch Alien on the night before Halloween. Alien is one of the true masterpieces of the horror genre, from a direction, acting, and writing standpoint. You'd be very hard-pressed to find a ""best horror movies"" list that doesn't include this movie. Although there are quite a few other movies in the franchise, none of them match the quality of Alien (Not even James Cameron's fantastic Aliens). Pretty much everything about this movie is iconic now; the poster alone has become permanently burned into the memories of people who have never even seen the movie. The film's many strengths stem from Ridley Scott's impeccable direction. Although people have criticized Scott in recent years for his latest movies, not a single person can deny that his direction is absolutely gorgeous. For example, the scene in which the characters explore the crashed Alien ship looks beautiful due to way Scott portrays its gigantic scale. The set design also adds to the tense atmospheres of the movie. The inside of the USCSS Nostromo, the ship that is the main setting of the film, is incredibly creepy and feels extremely realistic. And the main monster of the movie, the Xenomorph, has one of the coolest creature designs ever put to film. Although many movies are able to effectively create tension without showing the creature, the Xenomorph looks so scary that it works even when it is shown. The performances are also completely perfect and truly sell the claustrophobic terror of the movie. My favorite scene in the entire movie is the famous chest-bursting scene; the idea of a creature that grows in your stomach and ruptures it when leaving is so unnerving. After watching the movie, any stomaches that you may have will likely cause you a bit of anxiety. I also think that the twist involving Ash gives the movie an added layer of complexity and keeps it from being a movie that solely relies on a monster eating people. If you haven't seen Alien, I highly suggest watching it this Halloween season. It truly is one of the all-time greats and there is a pretty slim chance that any horror movie set in space ever tops it.",

I love this movie and always will love it, it's one of my all time favorite films and always will be. The cast is great, characters are excellent, alien is such an original film, and who will forget the iconic scene with the chestburster. I love the somewhat simplicity of the plot, and the great special effects, I only have a couple complaints. As much as I love this film every time I watch it, when ever it gets near the end I always ask myself, why does she go back for the cat? If it were me, I'm not going back for the cat with this killer alien on board and frankly I think a lot of people would agree with me, it doesn't make a lot of sense. Sure maybe you could excuse it if she had some kind of close attachment to the cat and they showed that in the film, but they don't, it's not until the end of the movie when Ripley says "" oh I've got to go back to get Jones!"" I'm sorry but as much as I love this film I always find that part hard to believe and it always bothers me. The other problem I have isn't quite as bad. I feel like the movie doesn't have enough of the actual Alien and also would have benefited greatly if they actual made it longer instead of its 114 minute runtime. I feel like they could have had more scenes with the alien chasing someone as opposed to Ripley running around trying to get to the shuttle and not actually even seeing the Alien except one time and the Alien doesn't even see her when she sees it. I've watched the 2003 directors cut and actually liked it a little better because of the additional scenes even though there is not many. Overall Alien is a very good film and a classic.",

There are queens, vaginal alien devices,the central computer is called ""Mother,"" and the thought of involuntary impregnation (face huggers), are all metaphorical vehicles on which the notion of power and death rely. This film is poetic, powerful and cinematic. Some feminists may disagree with me and say that my assessment is wrong, but what Scott is doing with all the female metaphors is simply re-instating the ultimate power of the life-giving (the queen laying eggs), life-sustaining (the drones impregnating their human hosts with their own alien species), and equally life-taking (they kill the host body they have used in order to lay their eggs), presence of the mother figure. Women are powerful. We have the capacity to give life or kill it, and this movie is an over simplification of this fact. Is this good? That depends on your point of view.",

H R Giger has been influenced by an oceanic lifeform called the Phronima, and modelled the beast on this tiny organism, to great effect. The drool factor, while not fully controlled in this one, is still gross in a cool way, and there's so much fun in watching the behind the scenes footage.

Well, three things: Suspense, mystery, and atmosphere. Each of those elements work together brilliantly. There's a veil of mystery over every scene, which immerses you in the world and makes you curious about whats going on. The film relies on very taught suspense; sure, you can tell when someones going to be offed by the titular monster, but even then the scenes are directed in a way that makes you hold your breath before the Alien makes its appearance. Just like everything else, even the Alien has a strong veil of mystery. The creature has a complex biology that entices, and the director gives just enough of it to the audience before hiding the rest. A brilliant idea, truly, because it ensures people would go to the sequel, be it good or bad (And in this case, REALLY good, but you already knew that :P). Then there's the way the alien acts. No CG, No animatronics, its a man in the suit, yet its looming presence can be felt throughout the film and believed. This all creates the atmosphere, which is perfect for the film.",

Possessing special effects not only amazingly advanced, but inventively advanced as well, this film Impeccably utilizes the darkness of space and shadows to build a claustrophobic, dank, and heart-stoppingly terrifying vibe and atmosphere. Being as artistic in its minimal philosophic depth as much as it is in its design, Alien to this day is the most original take on the idea of monster movies, space movies, and science fiction movies in general. Giving an antagonist similar in appearance to Godzilla the tactics similar to those of Michael Myers, by shrinking the roaming scale of science fiction monster movies from a large city, to just around the corner in a hallway. It's incredible how this film could make something as wide and empty as space feel inescapably close and narrow, and that is still as shocking as ever to this day.",

CGI cannot compete with an actual physical presence and never will. We are all used to it now, but the first time I saw the Alien, it was difficult to look at, it was truly disturbing looking. I think I first saw this movie on VHS with my family when I was 10. I don't think any other movie gripped me; the end when Ripley is running through the corridors back and forth is classic. My heart was pounding I can remember it to this today. I was in that hallway with her. The orange lights flashing on my face. Everything about this movie is just classic. The fact that you never get to know what the Alien really looks like, because it keeps changing. So, it stayed frightening, most monster movies, you get one look at the creature and it might be scary, but soon you get used to it, this movie never allowed you the chance. First, its a pile of Bones (yes, bones), in a derelict spacecraft. Then its the egg and the face-hugger, then it changes to the chest- burster, and onto the Alien. It almost feels like 2 different movies; Act I is so different and is a really good Sci-Fi feel with the Nostromo and crew flying the ship and the lander. ACT II brings on the tension as soon as they land on LV426. I remember waiting for something to jump out at them, while walking to the ship, but in true Hitchcockian suspense nothing happened. The anticipation to the jump-scare of the face-hugger was tremendous. Add to that the parts of Dallas in the Tube and the side story about this greedy corporation, and the Ash, wow. What a movie, I don't think it will ever be topped, just as the first 5 seasons of 'Game of Thrones' will never be topped - like 'Star Wars' and 'Empire.' The times we live in are not conducive to creating similar works of art. CGI has taken over way too much for the detail to be spent on creating something from nothing. CGI creates laziness, look at the neomorph in Alien: Covenant, it looked totally fake to me, it did not look like it was in the same room with the lady. Sad we never got Prometheus II.

After searching for survivors, the crew heads home only to realize that a deadly bioform has joined them. For me, this is director Ridley Scott at his very best. He has created a sci-fi masterpiece full of intensity and thrills. The chestburster scene has been watched more than the actual film itself. The acting of Sigourney Weaver must be applauded, one of the first ever Sci-Fi heroins, she gave a fantastic performance as Ellen Ripley.

Sigourney Weaver was perfectly casted for this movie and I for one will never forget her performance in this one and the few that followed. This film has a great mix of science fiction and horror, something a lot of similar movies fail to achieve. Also, it has some really good special effects for its time and I feel as though it has gotten over-looked by todays young audiences. If you liked Alien vs. Predator, and you have never seen the original ALIEN movie, then you need to go back and watch it and all the sequels to understand where this movie left its mark on alien movies of today.

I watched this movie alongside the predator, and i must say the predator is far entertaining movie, i eagerly wanted to see an alien with something innovative, but it lacks what the predator has i.e: heat vision and array of weapons. The alien movie reminds me of the film relic released in 1996, accept that sorry to say that relic has an edge over this one, because its more entertaining, rather than this boring farce, which i regret wasting my time on, the only decent alien movie of the franchise has to be aliens, all the rest after that have been worse than even this one. 2/10",

The dark planet where they find the eggs, the spaceship with incredible lighting effects, all this atmosphere makes the film one of the scariest you'll ever see.  The sound is also perfect, with a calm ambiance, that suddenly breaks, but stays in a very special mood.  The acting is very good, especially from Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm.  It's one of those ""It started it all"" movies...many many many cheap and stupid rip-offs were made...the storyline is so simple, but they made such a beautiful film with it.  And in despise of what many people say, ""Aliens"" isn't better than ""Alien"", it's just about the action factor...but the beauty of the first one is only seen in the first one...The storyline is the following: Some people on a spaceship capture a creature on a strange planet, and it evolves, and starts killing the passengers...conventional, you'll say?  Maybe, but being conventional can be very good, it depends on the what you do with your storyline...let's take the example of ""Sleepy Hollow"" from director Tim Burton, which has a very simple story, but the images are so nice and perfect, and dark that you can enjoy a lot more the movie than you would enjoy a very complex movie...""Alien"" is for people who can recognize good directing, and a good atmosphere, otherwise, if you prefer action, see ""Aliens"" or ""Alien:Resurrection"".  But this is the first and the best of the Alien series...and I'd say my second favorite Science-Fiction movie, after 2001:A Space Odyssey...Extraordinary film! 10/10",

Shooting angles get high quality effects. But I can't say that good about acting. Even the creature has become very realistic compared to those times, not artificial and toy-like. While watching the movie, I came to mind The Thing starring Kurt Russel. It was a The Thing style but a movie in space. The space shuttle in the film is a highly advanced machine compared to that time. What I mean briefly is far beyond the time of the movie. The movie also emphasized capitalism a bit.

Alls I can say is this holds up better with time, if you haven't seen the first 2 Movies then you aren't able to accurately gauge how amazing this series truly is. The writing, directing, acting and sets seemlessly put together a believeble world. The Alien single handedly makes the case for sticking with practical effects in Horror. Heck, ""The Thing"" and ""Alien 1, 2"" would be 3 prime examples I'd use. It's hard to fear for people you don't care for and hard to fear something that isn't really there. You won't have that problem here, our human and likeble cast are people you care for. Ripley, our warrior goddess in 1979 (before any SJW complaints existed) makes getting her Cat a priority in the Movie and does it intelligently.

H.R. Giger's exotic and modern Gothic designs are what bring the setting of this movie to life. The viewer can't help but feel uncomfortable upon the sight of all that has to do with the alien in an otherwise bland factory-like merchandise transportation ship in outer space.

With memorable scenes galore from this movie, its no surprised it turned 3 sequels, 4 if you include that outrageous AVP.Ay how this film defined what most horror movies of the legendary horror decade of the 80s. It set a new precedent of fear and accomplishment, using settings, camera angles, and decent acting and props, rather than just a man in a cape or some face paint and extra hair to scare the audience. Only a few films before this employed the deranged and bizarre concepts to scare rather than the what i call cheap scares, which is the scare achieved just for a temporary and quick jump or scream by the audience, those films all classics in their time and today include: Psycho (1960), Last House on The Left (1972), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Carnival of Souls (1962), Halloween (1978), Night of the Living Dead (1968), and Dawn of the Dead (1977)",

The story follows a deep space salvage team who get a a mystrious signal and they find something that will lead to the downfall of the entire crew.

3. relating the movie to star trek and star wars

4. The Alien isn't explained much
Yes because you fear the unknown, you don't know if it can die, you don't know why it kills, you don't know what it does to it's victims
5. Ripley strips to her underwear
so what? it's rated 'R' not 'PG-13' If you'd just been hunted by a ten foot tall monster with two sets of jaws, a sharp tail, and acid for blood you'd want to be comfortable while you sleep too

The most bizarre part of the film is also its most horrifying elliment; the chestburster scene. No one in 1979 expected that scene, and few ever predict it today. Rarely has a movie stretched beyond its original generation in this way. It is a very strange movie indeed. The plot itself is original in its own regard as a sci-fi. Then we get to the script (which is excellently paced and drawn-out), the characters (all having their own problems and weeknesses), and of course, the creature. Alien's creature is so memorable in so many ways that it is impossible for me to sleep without feeling a slight pain in my chest.

Pitting one alien against a crew of seven is a great set-up for some horrible and gruesome battles. But instead, it takes it further and draws the war out, singling out certain members as they leave the crowd, to face the creature on their own. It takes a good while before the action begins but all the build up it what makes the end result so utterly chilling. As soon as one of the main characters ""releases"" the alien, you know it's only going to get better from there. The sound effects in this movie are the best use of noise ever put on screen. The wind effects, the spaceships, the alien, the computers all have memorable sounds, and the creature design for the alien has become legendary. Undoubtebly one of the scariest films ever made.",

She reflects my ideal concept of a woman heroine in this movie. Her look, expressions, every move is perfect. None of that happens on Cameron's sequel, when they added a little girl so we can cheer for her and cry, I assume, which I didn't, and Ripley is turned into a sentimental Rambo with big weapons, losing all the enigmatic charm I loved so much here. This is the best movie Ridley Scott has ever made, even when the last scene could have been better for my taste, and surpasses by far Cameron's ""Aliens"", which is just a very dumb version of Terminator. I highly recommend Alien as a sci-fi horror, along with John Carpenter's The Thing. 8/10.",
971,20 July 2004,carlos_pimentel,10, Alien. The best of the series.,"My favorite horror movie and my favorite monster. This movie is the best on sci-fi and horror. It has the suspense to make you sweat, because we never know when it appears, and when it does you can hear your heart beating. In some scenes you can hear a heart beat, like in the scene where Bret is searching for the cat and the Alien appears behind him. The scene that scared me more was the scene where the ""facehugger"" jumps from the egg. During this scene i jumped from the sofa and almost it my head on the ceiling. the other scene was the borning of the alien, when he bursts from Kane's rib cage. That scene impressed I almost vomited during the scene. And my favorite scenes including the two that I said before, are the scene where we see Parker and Lambert being attacked by the Alien, the scene where Bret dies searching for the cat, and the final scenes with the Alien. I enjoyed to the other Alien movies and I truly recommend this one to any person ho hasn't seen the first.",

981,2 August 2006,moontiger5,10, An inhabitant of my nightmares for decades,"I first watched this film in 1983; due to my early age the viewing was heavily censored and I was instructed to retire to my bedroom after the scene in which Dallas announces that the remains of the face-hugger parasite will be taken to Earth for further studies. In 1985 I was allowed to view the film in its entirety, but remained in a state of shock after the arch-famous eclosion scene where Kane ""gives birth"" to the next stage of development of the Alien. It took yet another viewing for the full experience of the adult Alien hunting down the remaining members of the crew one by one, and the most pleasant surprise of seeing a female character (Ripley) turn the tables on the monster. Even as an adult I still shiver as an anxious Ripley traverses the cold and dark expanses of the Nostromo, on her way to secure supplies or activate/deactivate the ship's self-destruct mechanism, guessing by the movements in the shadows that the Alien is about to strike at any moment. Also, my stomach never fails to turn at the sight of the Alien torturing Lambert, or of the monster languidly stretching inside the escape pod, as if saying ""I'm not in a hurry for my next meal.""

985,5 November 2008,martijn-56,10, Perfection,"Maybe a 10 is given a bit too much for recently released movies, but this of course is from 1979. For a science fiction horror this is surely a big feat. I give it a 10 since I cannot discover any flaw in it and I also realize to sum up all the good things in it would almost make this and endless story. Even Ridley Scott himself admitted in his 2003 director's cut he changed little since he thought the movie was 'pretty good'. He had always been rather proud of it, he said. Rightly so. What are the elements of a great movie? Story, actors, cinematography (including spec fx), music. They were all perfect. The cast of course, well, no comment necessary. Excellent acting, and also the way they interacted with each other. Ripley really had the chance in this script to show her leading abilities (with irritation of crew members towards her, jealousy?), and earn her credits for being the only survivor of the Nostromo. Also her slowly built up distrust of the scientist is done well. Actually you have to see the movie again, to focus on his behavior's, then you see he is anticipating everything that happens, without much emotion. Story is excellent and simple. It also leaves a lot unanswered, like why the UFO landed there, but with still keeping it credible. Did the UFO find the Aliens on that planet, or did it carry the eggs all the way and crashed there? Well we do not know, since they could also not know it. Excellent foreshadowing when they walk up to the lonely fossilized alien looking at the stars: 'bones are bent outward, like he exploded from the inside. I wonder what happened to the other crew members....' Well, soon we know. The good thing is, you are so involved in the movie and effects, that at least I did not register all this stuff and was surprised as what happened to John Hurt later. Effects are amazing, even today. The view to the stars from the window of the ship while Ripley and the scientist wait for the rest of the crew to come back from the planet, for instance. Beautiful. Or the Nostromo, shot from below. Copied in Independency Day! Ridley Scott really made the setting do something in the story, which is how it should be (as also told in 'How to write a great novel' books by the way). The claustrophobic tunnels, the Art Deco copper designs, the chains, the water dripping, the beautiful alien ship, the smoke all around to hinder visibility (maybe the monster is there!), the sounds of the ship (esp. when it is turned on to automatically explode), the hyper sleep bed,they were all copied in the sequels, for a reason. Last but not least, the alien design. Just how great can it be? A black dragon without real eyes (nor emotion), and a mouth in a mouth. Just brilliant. Not possible to top. It also helps to believe the scientist's admiration for it's purity. After all, it is in it's ugliness also beautiful. Then, the music, great too! Mystical, sometimes creepy, totally fitting and making the atmosphere. For instance the flute sounds when they land on the prime ordeal planet. It all works in this movie.Incedible! And then just how it is shot. So many scenes that are memorable, too many to mention. For instance the slowly standing up of the monster from behind really makes the enormity convincing. Or Ripley in the end alone in the shuttle, with the almost stoned look on her face when she discovers the Alien is still there. That is excellent pulling back, I would say. In stead of being hysterical, she is almost serene, like really living a nightmare. If you can, watch it once with the director comment on, then you see it all, every artistic choice that was made, and had the right effect.",

990,21 October 2011,compi24,8," Review Of ""Alien""","Yeah, not really sure this movie needs an introduction, but here it comes anyway. ""Alien"" is a 1976 Ridley Scott directed Sci-Fi Horror flick starring Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, a warrant officer on a mining ship that begins to encounter strange creatures. Now, It's hard for me to say that I haven't seen ""Alien"" up until this point, but it's true so I'll cop to it. After seeing it, I can safely say that everyone I talked to was right - I missed a lot. ""Alien"" is a really great film, crafted by one of the greatest revolutionary living directors. Ridley Scott really shows his keen ability to develop unbelievable tension through almost every scene. I had to turn down the volume on my television at some points, because I was almost certain that something was going to pop up and scare the seven shades of poop outta' me. But that's the thing, it didn't always happen when I expected it to. This is something that horror movies today seem to fail to accomplish - in a sense, they give away when the jump scares are going to happen. ""Alien"" really excels at blurring the line between the moments when you're sure a jump scare'll happen and the moments when they won't. The story, written by the legendary Dan O'Bannon is often cited as the influence for numerous other Sci-Fi Horror films and stories. This story is the fulcrum of the film, and O'Bannon's ability to create unending tension via the narrative is really a noteworthy skill. The cinematography and lighting also really helps in creating intense strain on the audience. At one point in the film, it seems as though cinematographer Derek Vanlint uses strobe lights for lighting. This jarring effect, once again, keeps the audience intensely stressed out. The sounds in the film are really very eerie, as the unnerving creaking sounds of the Nostromo and the shrill shriek of the Alien still resonate in my head. Sigourney Weaver does a great job in one of her very first (and arguably most memorable) roles. H.R. Giger's set and costume design really shines in this film, possibly establishing the Sci-Fi Horror aesthetic as we know it. In the end, I found Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" to be an awesomely frightening film that effectively exudes the overwhelming amount of skill that was placed into it.",

Once I watched it (also after I'd seen a real shark lol), it was laughable how that and Alien are deemed so terrifying. Maybe I'm spoiled by CGI, which I'll admit does not make a good movie in the slightest. But, there is nothing scary, or suspenseful about this movie. Star Wars holds up, this movie is shtttt!

A movie that toys with the inner depths of the mind cleverly juggling with Claustrophobia, Fear and Tension passing them around like a magician with his wand coming up with trick after trick.

994,14 September 1999,Colonel Ted,10, An object exercise in visceral terror,"After 20 years, this is still the scariest and most suspenseful film I have ever seen. I was left rather in the cold after seeing James Cameron's sequel, Aliens, which is still very good, but can't hold a candle to Ridley Scott's classic in terms of shear terror. Some people complain that Alien is slow and thinking about it the pace of the actual script is leisurely. Yet from the start Scott creates an atmosphere that you can cut with a knife and moves the film along so that two hours pass by all too quickly. Its basically a haunted house in space as Scott preys on everyone's primal fears about the bogey man fear of the dark... and takes them too their extremes. Production values art direction, SFX, Jerry Goldsmith's score and performances from Weaver especially but also from British stars Ian Holm and John Hurt (Until he gets serious tummy trouble) is impeccable. The famous scene when the alien bursts out of his stomach still makes me feel queasy and this is an objective exercise in understated direction and the fear of the unknown (you don't see the creature until the very end) that is far scarier than Cameron's 1986 blast fest. A classic. 10/10!",

996,8 December 2006,scootwhoman,10, Gothic horror in the future.,"When it first appeared, 'Alien' was a totally new look for science fiction. Ridley Scott turned away from the sparkling white of brand new space ships, and turned to what has been called 'blue collar space'. The spacecraft was grubby, well used, the crew relaxed and focused on their routine tasks. Routine, that is, if you happen to be part of a crew of a space tug, one which hauls huge processor barges across light year gulfs. To deal with the long mission times, the technique of 'hibernation' is used, which slows the body processes down to a faint thread, retarding the physical effects of the passage of time.",

Its a epic sc-fi thriller/horror with solid performances.

As in one of their crew members being a designed robot who was sent to ensure the survival of the species, and didnt care about the crew members.

At the beginning of the movie everything seems very calm and harmless, until the Alien appears! From this point the movie starts a claustrophobic horror trip which takes your breath away. The most horrifying thing about Alien is, that the Nostromo-crew is just a simple commercial crew, so they are not armed well enough to face such dangerous creature.

""Alien"" caused more scares than most of the other horror movies of the 70's and 80's. I cannot remember hearing about the other horror movie classics, such as ""Halloween"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", creating some of the reactions this one did right in the middle of the theater. It still scared me, even after I knew what I was in for after watching ""Aliens"" and ""Alien Resurrection,"" (facehuggers and chestbursters considered mind you). Not many movies can do that. Certainly not some of the classic slasher films could. This film is far better than ""Star Wars"" or ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" It makes sense, it could possibly happen in the future, and it has an actual story to it, not just some people trapped in an area getting knocked off one-by-one (it didn't rip off Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians,"" thank you). The scene where Kane has the alien fetus burst out of his chest was probably the most visually disturbing moment in the whole movie. They never did that in ""Friday the 13th!"" ""Halloween"" never had a creature who had a second mouth that snapped out and bit chunks off of you. Freddy Krueger never bled acid for blood and laid an alien embryo inside your chest.",

It dwarfs the others as a matter of fact and actually made the others easy to do. Become the film laid out a masterful template. Attempting to re-release this film today would be a huge mistake, the generation has no patience for the type of style and setting up of a story that this films delivers. They want action and explosions right out the gate. They want horror but this films delivers terror which is totally different from horror. Terror stalks you and haunts you until your nerves are completely shattered and then it resigns. Only to return just when you feel you have a grasp on what just happened. Horror on the other hand is the end result of what you found terrifying. The film plays so deep in the mind that it is hard to escape the images.",

The editing was such that you never knew where any character was at any time. This really played out at the end when she was trying to get to the shuttle and you had no idea in which direction it was. The idea was to make sure any group broke up for any reason so that they could be attacked out of sight of the others. The flickering effect was just distracting.

My biggest complaint about this movie is that it loses a lot on a second viewing. The movie builds suspense by being extremely slow, up until the alien appears which is great for a first viewing, but if you know where the plot is going beforehand then it seems needlessly slow. That being said, this movie has been referenced hundreds of times in TV, books, and even other movies, and with good reason too! this movie is unforgettable because it creates such a terrifying situation with such high stakes and to give those stakes meaning, the movie isn't afraid to kill off characters.

The direction and the acting are good enough. Perfect special effects for 1979. The worst thing the sequels made was that they made us know who the survivor would be, otherwise you wouldn't be able to imagine it. Another reason that makes this movie perfect is the fact that it reminds me of the place and of the period I first watched it. I was 13 then and I was in Lesvos (a Greek island). Since then, every time I go there I watch all of the Alien series. Madness! :-)",

'Alien' was very suspenseful, and very well done for what it is, so it was really good. I watched it as a sci-fi thriller movie. This was a very good sci-fi thriller movie. It was suspenseful, interesting, and had cool images. That's what a sci-fi thriller is supposed to have in it. There was even some action, and things I've seen once before. That's because I saw 'Prometheus' before this. I liked this as well as I liked 'Prometheus'. The technology difference probably makes this a better movie. The scenery for this was great, and this movie was a very good idea. 'Alien' was very, very enjoyable almost all the way through. I thought the beginning was kind of boring, but still a bit interesting, because it was such a good idea.",
1089,6 March 2013,cosmonadz,10, Suspense Vs Horror,It doesn't matter how old this film gets its a timeless classic. Ridley Scott has managed to do what most others try again and again and fail. He has set a benchmark by what others use as a template for formula for a true horror suspense. It sees a crew being hunted down one by one through a maze which is the mother ship heading back to earth. With a cast perfectly balanced and an alien on the rampage it's edge of the seat stuff all the way to the end. With rare glimpses of the beast it goes to show that you can leave so much to the imagination and that's what scares us the most. With iconic scenes and a script that moulds the cast giving little known actors golden performances. Throw in a face hunger chest buster android make shift flame throwers and a certain Jonesy it has all the ingredients that makes a classic. Try if you may but really in space no one hears you scream!!!,

Giger is a GENIUS! His designs are so unique, and odd, yet fascinating. The Alien itself, the Space Jockey, the Space Jockey's Ship, The Nostromo. It was all so excellently innovated. I LOVED the look of the Nostromo. It's just so creepy. The claustrophobic feel of everything, the Gothic look with the paneling on the walls, and the shapes of the halls (hey, that rhymes!) it always feels like something's not quite right. Like there's something you missed, something wrong. It added to the creep factor of this movie an incredible amount. In my opinion, 10/10!

1105,10 April 2008,DanielWRichardson,10, Brilliant.,"This is really one of the best horror movies ever. Yes, it's a horror movie not a sci-fi flick. The direction is great as is the script. I love the dialog in this movie. The actors really did an excellent job, especially Weaver. Now I don't want to get on a rant here, but there is something that needs to be addressed. Rather than tell you how great the movie is or go through this film scene by scene, there is something I need to make clear. I have read a lot of reviews and I kept reading the same thing. ""In this movie Sigourney kicks some alien butt."" (Believe me I'd rather use the ""A"" word, but I'm afraid to get black listed.) Sigourney Weaver doesn't really kick alien butt until ""Aliens"" in 1986. Thats when see becomes the badas... er, badbutt alien destroyer. However, in the first ""Alien"" she's just a space trucker who's trying to get home to her daughter. She doesn't really become the hero we all know and love until later. However she does start to evolve into the hero in this one. She quickly stepping up to leadership when Dallas dies. I must admit I'm slightly sexist when it comes to a female hero. To me it's just not that believable, but in Sigourney's case she really pulls it off. I'm not going to lie, if I got chased by aliens and I had to either have Ellen Ripley or Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger from ""Predator"") on my side, I'd choose Ripley. Sorry, I ranted. Anyways this is the best movie in the ""Alien"" series, the ""Predator"" movies, and the cross-over movies. Normally, I'd say I recommend this if your a fan of so-and-so or I you like so-and-so kinds of movies, but no. I recommend this movie to everyone. This is one of those movies you should have already seen.",

What about our lives you son of a ....,"Along with Blade Runner, Alien marks the career highpoint of Ridley Scott, who in these two films manages to provide enough depth and character to match his visual splendour, unlike efforts such as Legend and Black Rain, which although looking brilliant, are relatively hollow films. Initially this may seem like a simple horror with its crew of a mining vessel being eliminated one by one by a cold-blooded alien, and structurally it follows a lot of the same plot events (walking around in the dark, false endings). What should be noted is that the cheap imitations that have followed (some good such as Predator, some bad such as The Relic), as well as the much more intense sequel Aliens have undermined the much more subtle terrors of the original. It has to be said that as terrific as Aliens is, it is a far more accessible and immediate film than Alien. This is not necessarily a bad thing, its just that this does not do Alien many favours, especially for those who may have seen Aliens first and hoped for an original of equal intensity. The truth is is that Alien is just as intense, but in different ways. Whilst Aliens form of terror puts you in the middle of a full-scale war, Alien prefers to leave you lost in a maze-like house with a monster chasing after you.",

Mother lesbian had a son gay? Who knows what crimes he must have done that he finished nailed to the cross? What if all that is just a legend made up just for church to be able to manipulate people. Instead of clashing fire with water into a sign of two clashing lines - a cross, these two elements should join into a new direction together, or into more different directions at one moment, into a shape of a Jested mountain in northern Bohemia. Have you ever seen the building at the top of Jested? That is the shape of this solution. Instead of a clash, blending together like two albatrosses.

It was probably a combination of the stark photography, the deliberate pacing, the creepiness and mystery of the set pieces, the unique futuristic grittiness (""The used future"", as George Lucas went on to call it) of the production design, the now-clich√©d ""Ten Little Indians"" storyline, the naturalistic and unpretentious performances, Jerry Goldsmith's effective score, the then-original combination of science fiction and horror, the lack of dependence on subplots and dialogue to carry the film and how the characters and the film remained interesting without it, and most importantly, how something that can seem cool for a kid (I.e. outer space) can suddenly become the most terrifying thing ever.

1136,10 October 2010,pc-privconfounder,6, A dissenting opinion,"""Alien"" isn't the masterpiece of horror so many people seem to think it is. The reason is that it has the biggest fault possible for a horror movie: an idiot plot. In any really good horror movie, the characters will fight the monster intelligently and resourcefully; they may be killed anyway, but at least they (and the filmmakers) will gain the respect of the audience. The astronauts in ""Alien"" are utter dorks, and have no idea how to fight the murderous alien. They do not search the Nostromo in large, well-armed parties after the alien flees the dining room. They do not get into their space suits and draw out the air in the ship (or better yet, flood it with cyanide gas, which will kill any carbon-based life, plant or animal). They do not weld bars over the openings of the air shafts when the alien goes there for refuge, making it a harmless prisoner. And on and on it goes, one stupid blunder after another. Real astronauts would have presence of mind in a dangerous situation, but the astronauts in the film have the same problem solving ability as the screenwriter--that is, none at all. Like so many Hollywood movies of the present day, ""Alien"" tries to redeem a poor script with high production values and star power, and achieves only middling results.",

Suspense has always been a hard thing for films to truly accomplish for me, but Alien creates it with ease. The pace of the movie drives along and engulfs the viewer. In the end, all I can say is that Alien is perhaps the most enjoyable movie I have seen.",

Horrifying, excellent direction, brilliant special effects, a cast that perfectly fit their roles and a great script. Again, what can I say about Alien, that hasn't already been said.

The sets are incredibly well made and could make ones' jaw drop, while the score is probably one of the most memorable of all time. However, the best part of the feature is the alien. Instead of sticking with the typical little green men we are confronted with something completely different. Something that's terrifying, and yet stunning at the same time. Unlike most of the horror/ thriller movies of our time, ""Alien,"" uses the less is more technique by showing less of the Alien. This allows our imaginations to run wild with our worst nightmares.

Every person acts like imbecile that has the only aim - to die. Aliens are very spectacular and illogical (in my opinion). They grow from embryo to huge monster having nothing to it, deposit eggs that have more flesh than grown monster, and pour rivers of acid and slime. Ah, and they kill :) The genre of the movie (according to IMDb) is Sci-Fi / Horror / Thriller. I'd say it's horror/thriller under sci-fi sauce. Some kind of sci-fi Jaws.

James Cameron is a great action movie director and that's what he turned Aliens into a commandos in space with typical bad ass Hollywood lingo that aged very badly because it was so imitated so often.

It keeps the viewers attention and doesn't resort to cheap scares or effects. It uses what I feel is the most effective tool in a suspense movie; the fear of the unknown. While I'm sure those of you who have not seen the movie know what the titular alien looks like, the filmmakers are in no rush to show the beast. If you re-watch the movie, you can see it hiding in the shadows at some points, but besides those subtle details, much of the fear is created by your own imagination.

Ridley Scott's direction and the editing of his sequences are extremely suspenseful. The cast is great, especially Sigourney Weaver as Ripley and Ian Holm as Ash, whose character alone is deserving of multiple viewings.
Even though the movie is well-rooted in sci-fi, there is something in it that connects with audiences. The ship is one the best in film, as it feels lived in and real.

Add a great musical score to add the tension great acting and some extremely intense scenes it is no wonder this has been a classic for many years. Not to mention h.r. Gingers designs throughout the film including what I believe to be one of the most terrifying movie monsters ever. I sometimes wonder if there was a remake of it how it would compare and most likely would not at all have the same impact simply because the audience would know what's coming. In fact there is a scene early on in the movie that the director did not want the actors to know what was going to happen to get the real shock effect. Of course some aspects of the movie are dated but that's inevitable and it doesn't damage the movie for me.

Twenty four years later I feel justified in saying ""yeah, it was worth it"". This movie stands alone in it's ability to reach down into my psyche and give me a taste of what it must have been like for early humans to have been on the menu of large animals with sharp teeth on a regular basis. To me this IS the scariest movie of all time for the simple reason that it is the only one that almost made me leave the theater from sheer terror ....and I've seen them all. There is a certain magic that happens when story, direction, cinematography, and music combine in such a way that produces a truly transcendant experience. ALIEN is one of those.

The Nostromo crew are working stiffs like you and me, although their work place is outer space. I'm not sure but I think space freighters of the future will probably be dirty and broken down, with tchotchke's lying around. Not only does this make them real to me, it makes their situation all the more personal to me as well. The sci-fi genre is cool and all, but the core of ALIEN's powerful impact is that all of us have that primeval fear of something coming up from the basement, or down from the attic to GET us. Even worse is the fact that this COULD actually happen in the not too distant future given the unknown universe and it's possibly hostile inhabitants. The one scene that has come to symbolize this movie for me is the cold, unemotional way the robot Ash conveys his admiration for the alien in the line: ""I admire it's purity.....a survivor....unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality"". The ingredients of the perfect movie monster. It's coming to get you, and you can't stop it because it would like nothing BETTER than to get you......nothing personal, you understand.

Parker was the funniest of the crew the way him and brett scare each other after letting the cat jonesy out the locker when looking for the alien. My favorite scene is where ripleys heading back to the shuttle and the alien id in the corridor and the music and suspense kicks in, that an ultimate scene.I also liked the bit where ripley trys to de-activate it and mother does not accept the abort sequence and ripley says "" you bitch"".."" ohhh"" and whacks mother one.",

I can't believe this movie was made in thirty-six years ago. The technique of CG is amazing. Some monstrous creatures are appear in this movie. Their appearances are so terrible that I shocked by them. One of the impressive scene is an egg with crack on it and light leaks from it. This scene is beautiful and exiting. Throughout the movie, it is scary to watch for me. However, I like its beautiful planet scene. Moreover, the dark tone of the color matches a sunless atmosphere of this movie. It received an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction, and Best Supporting Actress for Cartwright, and a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

It starts with seven crew members aboard a towing hauler, who are suddenly awakened from their deep slumber in cryo because of a distress signal they've received. They land on a distant planet only to find a massive derelict ship which has probably crash landed. There they find an alien organism- one which has acid for blood and grows at a menacing pace. This film reeks of atmosphere and to this day many films and video games have been directly inspired by its production design and vibe.

This has enabled the film to survive nearly 20 years of friendly [and unfriendly] comment, but it has also served to whet the considerable appetites of its devotees. The origin of the monster was [and has never been] not explained and its eerie and compelling life cycle has eluded definitive analysis. The creature in this film was so appallingly frightening, particularly in its ""chest burster"" and ""adult"" incarnations, that subsequent titles have been robbed of the carnivorous manifestations of this exquisite being. The character ensemble, with their informal chatter and their humanly territorial imperatives, gave the human victims an authenticity in the face of almost insuperable danger that the normal ""creature feature"" or ""slasher"" would almost certainly lack.

The music, cinematography and sets are astounding. Most of the performances are mediocre with the obvious exception of Sigourney Weaver, although Ian Holm is interesting.  There are several extremely scary sequences in this film, one of the more brilliantly staged ones being Tom Skeritt's hunt for the alien in one of the air shafts.  It is truly terrifying.  This film does have its flaws however.  The small bit of nudity at the end is totally ridiculous and really makes the power of the film drop at the end.  And some of the dialouge isn't that good.

The entertainment business is more concerned about selling a product than expressing artistic freedom. Can you imagine the ""dinner scene"" filmed in 2004? Kane would be eating Space McDonalds and drinking Space Starbucks before his space visitor made an appearance. Another example, Mother would become The Microsoft Nostromo Pentium Computer. ""Alien"" would have to be altered because it doesn't target the 12 to 18 age-group. The screenplay would be altered to dumb down the language and add ""cliche pop phrases"".

Thankfully Alien 3 was released which brought back all that suspence and great camera and mood i love (especially when you see it from the Alien's perspective, that's just down right freaky).

Many critics think it may be a unoriginal or the same old horror flick.  There was a lot more in the movie to deem it better than that.  First of all it wasnt exaggerated or blown into a scream fest.  It was more scary because there was silence.  It was in space, and they had no possible way for protection other than to face it or detonate the entire mission. The lifecycle of this Alien which was truly original and fascinating brought a lot suspense as well.  The egg, too the facehugger to the chestburster to the ALIEN, shows a very elaborate growth to make such a beautiful creature.  H.R. Giger is an awesome artist, and being a huge fan of his work, I loved his set design as well as his ALIEN.  The absence of eyes in the ALIEN makes it all the more terrifying.  I watch it today and am still in awe of the ALIEN design and the set of the movie.  Its a movie to appreciate in many aspects. Rating:9",

Alien more than delivered these expectations. The beginning is very slow, but it helps build up to the main plot very well, and just adds on to the terror as the characters are also developed. The horror scenes are very scary as they can be unexpected as to where the creature is. Overall this movie was scary and could be disturbing for some as well. The acting done by Sigourney Weaver is very well done, although the rest of the cast doesn't really give an amazing performance. Sigourney Weaver's (or Ripley) terror seems convincing throughout the whole film. FOr a movie made in the 1970s, the special effects were very amazing, as if they were just bad special effects in this day and age. The alien was very well made and seemed real.

The chest-burster scene is just an unforgettable moment too. Who would think of an alien latching onto someone's face, then plant a seed in them? Then to make that alien die off and have the larva burst out of a man's chest. It's one of the best scenes in horror history.

But all the characters seem real and relatable- which is down to the fantastic actors portraying them, and more importantly they are all on equal levels so that we really don't know who is bound to die and who will be the last man standing.

1236,12 July 2006,seedofbilly,10, Definitive Sci-fi horror,"The general consensus for horror culminated with science fiction now days is not a good one, in general when one is made it turns out badly, Chronicles of Riddick, AVP, resident evil, I could go on and on. I greatly respect all directors who willingly take on the challenge of creating any horror film, they're in my opinion some of the hardest types of film to pull off, generally they are either great or terrible, atmosphere is easy, whats hard is maintaining a solid plot to go around it, some films are in the middle, as it where, the hills have eyes and the new omen are prime examples, they are good attempts but I wouldn't rush to see them again. There is so much more to horror than being frightened, Alien wouldn't ever keep me awake at night, but I still think its a masterpiece. Another common mistake is just a total gore fest, those are fun, in a hideous way, but not generally good films, some are balanced, some go way to far and get away with it (evil dead) some go way to far and don't (Hostel). I know you might be thinking that those two films aren't so bad, but I only mentioned them because they weren't banned form viewing, I'm not even going to start about such things as driller killer and stuff you find in a psycho's apartment. And now we get to why Alien is the best film of its type, ever made. Because everything that horror should be came to together in the right way, the isolation, the build up to the aloneness, the betrayal, everything, one particularly good factor is the feeling of relief before the big crunch at the end, war of the worlds tried a similar tactic, but over did it a little, none the less, it works wonders. The production team were good (british of course) H.R. Giger provided some uniquely stylish and scary concepts and it spawn the chest-bursting scene which was 'one of the best scenes for sending the whole cinema into an uproar of all time' I agree with that, apparently people actually had to leave because it was that shocking, what amazes me is that in terms of plot twists Jame Cameroon was able to match it in shock factor in Aliens with the queen appearance, classic.

If this was to be released today it wouldn't look that out of place, as the sfx have been so cleverly done, only the computer's make it look old fashioned.  The most amazing thing about the whole film is it's ability to play on man's fear of the dark & of smothering/suffocation to make you not hate the alien but only to fear it greatly.  This was the first film to make me look under the bed repeatedly before putting the light out at night.  The only other film to really do that was John Carpenter's The Thing, which made you look at every living creature suspiciously for a while after seeing it.  Alien revitalised a stagnant movie genre by shaking off the B pic image normally given to space monster movies & in doing so set an awesome benchmark for other's to follow, few have done it anywhere near as well. All the sequels have been different in their own special way but none truly captures the tenseness & claustrophobic quality of this terror masterpiece.  This is a must have film for any collection.",
1247,10 May 2020,rgee01,9, Remembering When,"When I was a child, Howard Hawk's ""The Thing, From Another World"" scared the living daylights out of me. It wasn't just the ""creature"" played by James Arness, but the atmosphere, the entire setting. ""Alien"" for me is reminiscent of that. The first time I saw ""Alien"" was on BETA, at home, around 1983 - 1984. I admit, my use of cannabis also played a part in my attentiveness. The atmosphere, the anticipation, was all so reminiscent of ""The Thing,"" that is, what's around the corner. The characters were ""everyday people."" People caught up in a situation not previously encountered but one that would test their survival skills and ability to work as a group to survive an encounter with a humanoid, but alien life species. None were super heroic types, they were just everyday people trying to survive an encounter with an alien lifeform, one that was hostile. Had I seen ""Alien"" at the age I was when I saw ""The Thing,"" the impact would have been just as scaringly profound and impactful. A thrilling horror movie not to be forgotten. Love it still!!",

Like many of them, 'Alien' is largely set in one location and the characters cannot escape from the other-wordly menace that threatens them. I consider it a masterpiece of the SF/Horror genre, and still, despite its many good challengers, the best. I first got interested in it years ago when I read a magazine article about Giger, the creator of the extraordinary 'artwork', including creatures, alive and dead, in the film.

I am talking about the first 3, the ones that really create discussion. Ridley Scott's horrifying, psychological but also very cold ,'Alien', James Cameron's exciting, tense, but also very dumb, 'Aliens', and David Fincher's interesting, experimental, but flawed and hardly scary at all, 'Alien 3'. First of all, why have I included Alien 3. Because it is different, enthralling and completely underrated. It is brilliantly edited (just look at the opening credits if you disagree with me), it has Sigourney Weaver's best performance of the 3 and the soundtrack is amazing. Then there's the first, Alien. Still horrifying, still amazing to look at and still inspiring Alien is still one hell of a film, age only slightly damaging it. But age has still has done a bit of damage. Its scares are not as scary, it's technology not as futuristic, and its special effects not as special. Yet it is still an amazing film. And then finally there's Aliens which is exciting, exhilarating and by far the most fun of the bunch. It also has the best variation on the Alien by far with the queen and stands as one of the greatest sequels ever. But age has been the least kind to this installment with 80's being written all over it. It also has the most annoying characters of the lot and it is the least disciplined one of the three deciding to take the least perfected route of three and decides to take a more conventional route of the three. But it sure is a lot of fun. So what is the best one? I'll let you decide.",

1269,21 November 2018,jesscampbell-88742,9, Sci-fi horror supreme.,"In many ways, Alien was the first of a kind. True - it wasn't the first space movie to feature a homicidal monster, nor was it the first time a group of characters were hunted down one-by-one in dark, dank spaces. However, this ""haunted house in space"" film was one of the first to effectively cross-pollinate these two genres. Alien became the blueprint for dozens of rip-offs and three sequels. In addition to blending graphic horror with science fiction, Alien has another distinction - it is one of the first films to feature a female action hero. Even today, on those rare occasions when a woman takes the lead in an action/adventure movie, she is typically measured up to Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley. Alien contains its fair share of genuine scares. These aren't mere ""boo"" moments, where something benign jumps out of the shadows accompanied by a loud noise and a musical crescendo, but legitimate shocks. The first occurs when the face-hugger leaps out of the egg and attaches itself to Kane. The second is when the alien explodes through Kane's chest. A masterpiece.",

Nowadays, with such cheap horror like Urban Legends, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, Sleepy Hollow, Jason X, and all the rest, where things jump out at you and kill you at every turn, the fright level of ALIEN might not be as high as it was 23 years ago, but it still remains a solid thriller.",

I believe it must of been tough for her. She was very smart using a gas the alien didn't like against it to distract it long enough to open the shuttle door and suck it out into space. I have seen a scarier and more disgusting movie however. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a lot scarier and a lot more gross.

You don't get to see the creature that much, which is good, because the appearance of this thing is not the interesting part (no offense to the creature designer H.R. Giger, it looks pretty good), the important thing is that it's there. One thing that makes Alien so good is that you don't know if the creature can be killed or not, which you knew already from the beginning in Aliens. But still the sequel gets a higher vote from me...

I'm amazed at intelligent movie goers claim not to like this film over the others. Yet, the others would not have a leg to stand on without this film.

Ridley Scott had realism in his mind when he made this classic - 99% of the gadgets in the film actually worked.  The cast is second to none, and proved that using a mix of British and American actors was the way to go.  His almost fly-on-the-wall approach paid off so well in setting up the characters.  Suspicion and suspense were the keys; the mystery of the alien; the quirkiness of Ian Holm's acting.  I first watched this film at the tender age of 10, on a friend's aunt's pirate video (she was one of the first people in our area to have a VCR!), around 1980.  And it scared the hell out of me!  Again, this film is superior to its great sequels.  But it shouldn't really be compared, having a style all its own.  Compared to more recent horror films, it may not have the same impact.

But this is not in anyway a plot driven movie. What makes this movie great are its environments brought to life by a flawless and genius direction by Ridley Scott. The characters, all built by strong performances, specially by Tom Skerrit, Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm and John Hurt, seem completely convincing as 22nd century people crewing the ""Nostromo"", a titanic starship. When the appearance of the alien comes, the designs made by H.R. Giger are quite notable, making the creature itself also a milestone in horror and sci-fi. The only problem I can see in the movie is the fast pace of the end sequence that leaves behind the questions about the nature of the creature itself, that as a scene shows, is a reflection on a broken mirror of humanity itself. That doesn't stop it from being a great movie.",

When we saw Alien i was a student in England in my teens. People were leaving the theaters scared to death!!!We never had a similar experience in the past. It was the scariest movie we have seeing up to that time. It's being copied ever since thousand of times, but never surpassed even by Aliens, which also is a very good movie, an action thriller and not a sci-fi as this original. The creature is also the meanest, ugliest, scariest and perfect alien ever designed. It is the perfect killing machine, and this what makes the film so interesting. The humans are helpless when confronting it, and although technology has advanced they are still very weak compared to it. I think that if there is a moral issue coming from Alien is that we have to be humble no matter how much we advance scientifically.

The director, Ridley Scott, went on to do great movies like Gladiator, Hannibal, and Thelma & Louise; Sigourney Weaver, who plays Ellen Ripley in this movie, was nominated for best actress in the films sequal; John Hurt, famous for being the guy who's chest gets torn apart by the first alien, went on to get an oscar nomination for his performance in The Elephant Man the following year; and the alien itself was designed by famous surreal-artist, H.R. Giger.  What more could you ask for in a film?  What the last guy deemed as ""boring"" is actually suspense for those with a greater I.Q. that the common Rambo-fan.  Watch this movie, enjoy it, and then carry on to watch the other 3 films.  Everyone of these movies has it's own feel and each is directed by an up-and-coming genius!",

But, as the film began I started to think ""This isn't actually that bad!"" But then when the alien jumps out his chest i thought ""Great, another horror/ sci-fi film with no plot. But then I started to get in the film. All the twists and tense scenes, and by the end I was thinking, this film is well and truly AMAZING. And by the end I wanted more!

It was a moment in cinema that will never be repeated. Alien is the brainchild of Dan O'Bannon filtered through the fertile minds of Brandywine productions and artistically captured by Ridley Scott with the most terrifying space monster of them all courtesy of H.R Giger. What is left to say?,
1304,2 March 2010,ryan-601-662752,9, A lost art classic,"In today's world of CGI blockbusters, you just don't get the grittiness that Scott presented us with anymore. From the cramped feel of most of the scenes, to the use of miniatures and low tech ways he delivers the tension. It is really sad that in today's world most movies still cannot touch Alien of even Aliens, 20 plus years on. I can still watch this movie over and over and pick up something new every time. I sometimes have to wonder if directors in the future may return to shooting movies in this manner and revive an old art form, just to be nostalgic. Or maybe one day when CGI is so good we can't tell between it and reality if they will apply an Alien type filter to there movies to finish it off. All you have to do is watch Avatar to see what I am talking about, don't get me wrong I loved Avatar and it goes without saying Jim Cameron is one of my favourite, for obvious reason. But there is still something fake in the implementation of CGI movies. Although I must admit Avatar to me was the first time since lets say Terminator 2 that the line became really blurred without having to keep reminding yourself it isn't CGI.",

As a sci-fi buff, paticularly in my youth in the 50's, I was impressed by it's quality, it's gothic aura, it's excellent acting by a top notch cast, and it's creation of the first truly female hero I had ever seen in a movie. There have been a lot of ""heroines"" in movies but this paved new ground. Maybe someone could come up with an example I missed but I've given it some thought and I draw a blank in trying to compare it to anything that came before. Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, the Science Officer, was the only person on board the ship that kept her head when all hell was breaking loose.She had no romantic or family ties to any other character that caused her to rise up and take over for her husband like Pilar say, in Hemingway's ""For Whom the Bell Toll's."" She was not merely equal to a man or inspitational like the Katherine Hepburn's Rose in the African Queen. She had no special gifts like Joan of Arc, Wonder Woman, or Sheena of the jungle. There were no sexy gimmicks, she never deffered to any of the male crew except by rank. In other words she was like  John Wayne's, Clint Eastwood's, or Sylvester Stallone's characters in her ability to get things done and keep her head. Sigourney, by the way, is a hell of a lot better actor then any of those guys. This was a good movie in many ways but I've never heard it mentioned as a ground breaking vehicle for women's equality.",
1310,2 March 2017,morganseer,6, Poor choices by characters,"This movie has a plethora of reviews that highlight the positives, and I agree with them and see no need to reiterate them. But in my opinion it does have one major flaw that spoiled the overall effect for me, and that is that every bad event in the movie occurs because of a stupid decision on the part of one of the crew members. There is one exception, I won't betray the surprise there, but in all other instances I was shocked at the lack of professionalism among the crew.

H.R. Giger discusses his nightmares and dreams and you can't help but be enraptured in his ""madness"".  Everyone who helped make this film all talk about the incredibility of it and show what it was like to make this ""genre"" film at the time (1979).  In 1981, as a boy, I read the book and it enthralled me.

The story certainly wasn't especially original; the film itself was one-track (Though some - myself included - would argue that that's part of its individuality); but the chasing scifi pack is so far behind that it probably will stand on it's own for generations. It's too bad it wasn't allowed to stand alone, since to a certain to degree the sequels have diluted the formula of a film concentrating on one thing; terror. No time wasted on sub-plots or character development, or expensive sets and special effects.    The fact that the film is so good without all the additions that most people seem to feel films must have these days (Don't get me wrong, sometimes they help!), speaks volumes about its maturity, its directness, and also about moviemakers/moviegoers today.

No matter how many times you watch this film it makes you perceive new ideas, with the excellent soundtrack still gripping audiences of all ages. Look at what this film actually created: 3 sequels, 2 unofficial ones and a prequel that's released in 10 days here in the UK.

1323,2 May 2018,pabloxmarcel,9, Who brings a cat aboard a Spacecraft?,"The hiring manager for the Nostromo Project should be shot. What I see is a crew with no apparent training whatsoever in important interplanetary mission aboard 19th century spacecraft. 
The spacecraft uses medieval technology such as incandescent light bulbs, a robot filled with milk, and harpoon guns. Ok, it was 1979, but they should have invented a different kind of lighting, a different kind of robot, and a different kind of gun. A Spaceship is supposed to be advanced, not to mimic Steam-Powered machinery draped in flexible steel conduit. On the positive side, I kind of dig the vintage buttons, controls and gages. In addition, the headsets are cool. I would wear one of those at work. 
What kind of Law applies in outer space? I assume that US Law applies aboard US Spacecraft. The crew made sure that every single safety standard was violated. I don't know the details of the contracts but I suspect there was a breach at some point and the crew member families should not be compensated or at best, partially compensated. For example, 'Professor' Dallas go on to inspect a suspected acid leak without wearing safety glasses. The test procedure consist of using a probe (pen) touch the acid with the probe, and then, give back the probe to his purported owner. It seems to me that everybody acted on their instincts and under some perspective they behaved like primitive creatures. Wearing a headbands doesn't make you tougher, and smoking does not make you cool. Humans should be an example of civilized behavior and I think the Alien got a very bad first impression about us. 
Lastly, the movie title is wrong or is missing something. The Alien should take the name of the planet she was born in.",

That said, the director extended that desperate aggression out into the universe. It is a lonely place, a violent place, where even human life is cheap and a species could be extinguished without guilt. Eventually all moral issues were put aside and the true horror of base animal survival took over. It was frail humanity versus a brutal universe in the form of an alien species that had no other urge but to feed and breed. Like in Jaws we saw so little of the creature that our imaginations took over and created a world far worse that any that could be put on screen. In a way to put in on screen is to exorcise the demon and face the tangible fear. But to keep it in the shadows was brilliant. I can think of no better horror movie of this kind.",

Once they realized the alien was in the freighter portion, they could have escaped in the ship. They went looking for the alien. The smarter thing would have been to huddle together and let the alien find them. They could have donned space suits, tied themselves down, and opened an airlock when the alien showed up. Technology existed to make an android as sophisticated as Ash yet there was no such thing as internal sensors or scanners aboard the ship? The idea of an alien cocooning a victim was to create more aliens. This alien was wasting its time. It cocooned Brett and Dallas (see the directors cut) but no other eggs existed with face suckers. They would have starved to death. Finally, I would have hid in the computer room where they accessed the mother computer with flame thrower in hand.

The movie has a very amusive and compelling storyline griping you from beginning to end. Not only is it well written but the director Ridley Scott manages to capture the lonely emptiness of space perfectly. Every scene is wonderfully lite and props are perfect, not to mention the swooping camera angles that add to the shaky uneasy horror segments. Along side all these elements you have one of the most iconic and all around greatest horror creature, the xenomorph, perfectly designed to be a killing machine with more weapons in its arsenal than you can shake a stick at.

I had heard about it but I figured because the way people described it that it wouldn't make it on TV. I have seen the actual video movie too but after TV. I did notice the sound of Lambert being killed didn't make it on TV because the sound of her screams shocked me when I saw the unedited video. I was surprised when I saw the video. I was like..where did that come from? I looked at my TV tape again and the sound is taken out but you hear all the other noises of the ship in place of her screams. Also on my TV tape you don't see the alien hand go up Lambert's leg. You see her standing there looking scared though. It is not on TV at all...at least the station I taped it off of. At the point the hand is supposed to go up her leg on TV you can tell it cuts away because the sound, voices and music makes a blip sound like something was cut I thought maybe they just cut a bloody scene or something. It makes me think the intent was to make you think she was raped by the alien. But the only reason I believe that is because it was cut out of TV. Why else would a sound be cut? No blood or anything in that scene. You don't even see it. You just hear it and I guess that was too much for TV. But if not for TV cutting it out, I would have thought she was killed the same way as everyone else.

Some great atmospherics and the basis of a good plot but it is so dated it doesn't really bear up under modern viewing. The technologies used is very dated, CRT screens, no voice activation of anything and the sets were very of their time. Good for plot but not based on anything you might expect. There are flaws such as quarantine rules for extra vehicular activity but no medical facilities available, just hold in the entrance. What got me most was the cardboard characters, in particular the second woman. I can't even remember her name. She was like a 70s doctor who assistant. When ever anything happened it was classic hands to the face and scream. Life and death situation - just do nothing.The obsession with the cat was also cringe-worthy.

One of the eggs hatches and wraps itself on one of the crew members face. One back on the ship the alien unwraps itself from the member, lying dead on the floor. The crew member wakes up like nothing had happened. Then all hell breaks 'out'. Because the alien put an embryo inside the crew member that burst out of the crew members chest. From that point on the suspense begins. This movie is outstanding, and the alien design is wonderful. The cast delivers everything right, especially Sigourney.

""Alien"" - recognized as a classic of cinema and an example of how to look good sci-fi film. He is a dark, largely original so much that at one time caused fear and loathing among the audience.

From the directing, to to the story, to the effects, it is, with no doubt, the greatest SciFi/Horror film of all time. From the first few minutes of this movie you are hooked. The character development is great, and the story only gets better as the movie goes along. Once the action starts, it never stops. This was one of the most creative films ever made. Very few movies before Alien had the same magic that this movie managed to create (Two that come to mind are King Kong (1933) and the original Star Wars). Even though I knew of the chest burster scene before watching this movie (I saw Alien for the first time last year), it still caught me by surprise. The chest burster looked so much more realistic than the one in Alien vs Predator. The characters emotions during this scene, and the rest of the movie, were very realistic. This is my favorite movie, and I believe that it will never be topped by any movie to come.",

The depth and detail of the world gave birth to a franchise that has no sign of ever ending. Furthermore, the pace and tone of the film build horrific tension perfectly. It may be a gradual tale of rising stakes but it never feels slow or boring. The greatest feat of all is creating a terrifying movie monster but never giving the audience enough of it.

A science fiction film so very far ahead of it's time and yet still talked about today, a true classic. There are so many reasons to laud this move, I could easily write a page or three, but I'll be brief. This film contains at least two, possibly three of ""those"" moments - The ""chestburster"" flinging out of John Hurt's (Kane) stomach - absolutely one of the most sickening, gruesome scenes in any film, and at the time completely stunning, a true cinematic moment. The ""facehugger"" jumping out of it's egg (again at poor John Hurt), I challenge you to watch this without an involuntary flinch. Also worth considering is the revelation that Ian Holm (Ash) is an android, sinister (and definitely not ""three laws compliant""). You can watch this again and again and still see more in this superb film, it contains the suspense of Hitchcock, the stark ""look"" of 2001 (perhaps surpassing it) and REAL characters (how's that for a sci-fi flick?). This film stands on it's own merits as a genuine milestone in cinematic history, I kid you not.

I don't like how the technology can be so advanced but not at the same time. I'll be mentioning slight spoilers from here on. There was a scene when the captain was searching for the alien through the air ducts and the crew was tracking his position. You would think with a 10+ story ship their tracker would be 3 dimensional but no. That's not the only plot hole though, at the end when they could've just left the ship through the pod the black man and girl went to get coolant for the pod. Turns out that was a waste and they didn't even need it since the pod worked just fine. Not to mention there was absolutely no point in riley going through so much trouble for a damn cat. It just is really unrealistic I mean if i was Riley I would not care about my cat I'd care about my crewmates but no she sent them to get unnecessary coolant just for the sake of plot. I was really hoping for a smart and high tech scary Sci-Fi film but instead I got a dumbed down ""The Thing"" ripoff with even stupider characters and in space. The only good thing about this movie was the atmosphere and technology in the ship. The character progression within the crew was also cool and i really liked the black man since his development is interesting. I conclude that this film is only high rated with an 8.5 only because its considered either nostalgic or a classic, not because its actually good, because its not.",
1383,31 October 2004,ravravk,9, A truly Great Film,"Alien has become fully franchised, unfortunately so like all good things. When I first watched this film more than twenty years ago, the terror and horror were not due to the double-mouth or the creepy thing with the prehensile tail. The gut-splitting scene was horrifying but not the best. I experienced the terror because Scott was careful enough not to show the Alien too many times. In fact, only towards the end you get a good look at the thing. At other times, it is for the fraction of a second, no more. During the entire length of the film, you know that this thing is somewhere in the ship, may be in the engine room or may be in the accommodation, it can be anywhere. But you do not know it until you come face to face with it, and when you do, you are dead. It is classical horror, not the blood and gore/ face-with-third degree-burns formula that we see today. The suspense and the wait for the inevitable to happen- that sums it up. And then, like all great horror films (I do not know if I should really classify this as a horror film), that feeling in your stomach as you wonder if anyone in the crew will survive to get back at the monster at all!

It is a robot that doesn't respect the three famous laws (remember Asimov's _I, Robot_) and that has been programmed to get a unique objective: get hold of that strange creature which has been found in a distant planet. In order to do so, it is allowed to kill all the crew, who is declared expendable. But... what is that which is so important? It is, no more no less, what the robot considers to be the most perfect creature in the universe (and which to the rest of the viewers is just a vicious destroyer). The robot has been created by some kind of Nazi, obsessed with purity of race, with organism perfection. And that is what the creature stands for: perfection, a sort of Super-Man (a-la-nietzsche). But it comes under a monstrous, disgusting appearance, reflection of what it really is about to bring. In that sense, to me, Alien represents the dangers of looking for perfection. That quest implies fights among people, dilemmas, having to toy with life and death, paranoia... Had it not been for the robot's orders to get samples of that perfect creature (commands dictated by some humans on Earth who we never come to know), nothing would have happened and Nostromo would have come back to Earth.",

It is hard to review because of how loved it is. I loved the movie but there are some things I need to address. The beginning is a bit slow. There are just shots where nothing is really happening. I really liked 2001:A Space Odyssey so I should be able to tolerate that but I just didn't work as well. Once they find the derelict the movie really starts to pick up. I don't know if that counts as a spoiler though. To be honest the movie didn't scare me. The tension the movie creates is fantastic but it didn't scare me. As a suspense movie it is amazing. There is only one scene where I was like OMG but the rest was just tense and that isn't a bad thing. The mystery of the Alien is incredible and it keeps you interested. The ending wasn't groundbreaking but it does the job. I give it a 9 out of 10 because of the slow beginning but I will still buy it.,
1415,17 May 2005,evelmckin,10," In space, no one can hear you scream. . except for what's killing you...","Alien, really is the first truly terrifying science-fiction horror of all time. The realism, the darkness, and the claustrophobia. It all culminates into an intense and frightening experience. This is the only scary movie that I can watch over and over again, and still feel disturbed by it. Ridley Scott did an excellent job with this movie. It has a great story, human characters that we can relate to, and the most horrific monster you could imagine in the worst of your worst nightmares! A creature that uses humans as a catalyst for it's sexual reproduction. And then kills it's host by violently exploding out of the body like a ticking time bomb. To the Aliens, the human race is expendable. And to the company that is trying to use the Aliens as Bio-Weapons we are expendable. NOW THAT'S SCARY! But this movie isn't just about a hideous Alien stowaway on the rampage, it's about Ellen Ripley and her struggle to destroy the Alien race forever. . . If you haven't seen this movie, then I strongly advise you pick it up at your local video store. Then I promise everyone will hear you scream!",
1416,20 February 2023,qskft,4," Amazing acring and cinematography, especially for its time, however its another one of ""those"" horror movies","Though i thought the movie was well acted and visually stunning for its time, it really irritated me , like a lot. It's different from watching a low budget horror movie, where the inaction and thoughtless decisions of the characters is laughable, in this movie, it just irritates you . Only one character had an ounce of common sense(they were not thr main protagonist). Overall it just angered me a lot, and i dont tend to feel this way about films. They do such a good job with the acting pulling you into the characters and feeling for them, or some of them, but then they all follow classic horror movie logic. Also very predictable from start to finish, whenever a character is slightly on their own, you can tell they are about to be killed off. As soon as the main ""plan"" is mentioned, you can predict the ending of the film, and even beyond it. I haven't seen a trailer or anything to any of the sequel, yet simply by knowing sequels exist you can predict the beginning of the sequel midway through this movie.",
1417,21 July 2013,worth-palmer44,9, Still the King of Alien Movies!,"I still remember the terror I felt watching this in the theater so many years ago! Ridley Scott's Alien is a truly horrifying horror/sci-fi film that really brought that genre back to life of 50's alien movies. The music, cinematography and sets are astounding. Most of the performances are mediocre with the obvious exception of Sigourney Weaver, although Ian Holm is interesting. There are several extremely scary sequences in this film, one of the more brilliantly staged ones being Tom Skeritt's hunt for the alien in one of the air shafts. It is truly terrifying. This film does have its flaws however. The small bit of nudity at the end is totally ridiculous and really makes the power of the film drop at the end. And some of the dialouge isn't that good. But overall a great movie. And the music is incredibly scary...especially during the opening credits. It sets you up for the terror that is soon to follow!",
1418,12 December 2015,PurpleFilm,8, a masterpiece,"Alien is a masterpiece of the genre, and the talented Sigourney Weaver is amazing. At the beginning the film is quite slow, and this is nothing but a smart directorial choice to raise the suspense yet emphasized by the dark atmosphere and the terrible silence of the outer space. The plot twisted and turned within the Nostromo space shuttle (except when the astronauts land in the unknown aliens' planet) but the film is not boring at all: instead is thrilling, the cast is exceptional and harmonious, the direction is outstanding and the plot is interesting and very new at that time. The charming character of the brave Ellen Ripley stays sculpted in the history of science fiction's cinematography. Unfortunately they created a saga of useless Alien sequels and recently an ugly duplicate (with ""Prometheus""). The very first Alien remains the best sci-fi horror movie in the history of cinema (so far!).",

'Alien' has it all, a deadly monster who gestates inside a living host, a spaceship full of interesting characters that inevitably become fodder for the scary beast,an evil android who is programed to protect the monster at the expense of the crew, and a heroein who kills the monster and saves herself and her cat at the end of the movie. The concept was top-notch, the Alien was a new innovative movie monster that terrified viewers from all over the world, the script was original and innovative, and Ridley Scott was absolutely brilliant as the director (although i do have to say that this movie is one of his shining moments in his career, 1492-A Conquest in Paradise really sucked, lol). Although i was only 7 years old when this movie came out, i remember watching the trailers on television and really wanting to see it which i finally did when our household owned it's first VCR, it was great and i still get those chills up my spine whenever i throw it in the DVD player, it's truly a scary movie and dang, they made Sigourney Weaver look so flip-pin' hot!!! definitely a 10 outa 10 in my book....",

1424,13 March 2006,kevinwelland,10, Sci fi blockbuster.,"This is truly the best sci fi horror of all time,and the film which gave us Sigourney Weaver as the first true Hollywood heroine. The plot is simple. A crew of 7 astronauts is put in peril when an alien being invades their space craft. The moment when the creature bursts out of John Hurts chest is without doubt one of the classic film moments of all time. After that, the crew is slowly wiped out one by one, until we are left with Weaver as the sole survivor. She must do battle with the alien to survive. Ridley Scott does a wonderful job with this one. The set is very claustrophobic, you can almost imagine yourself on board and feel the tension the characters are feeling. Watch out for the scene in which one of the male crew members has to go and look for the ships pet cat. Walking through spooky areas you are waiting for the moment the alien is going to jump out on him, but it only happens when you least expect it. A great film, and one that still holds up today.",
1425,8 January 2006,dh1897,9, Best sci-fi film ever,"Brilliant design, cinematography and ensemble acting.The strength of this film is that, unlike its sequels, it has relatively little gore, and instead slowly and calmly builds up a sense of suspense and stark fear. Cold and detached in its storytelling. This is my favorite sci-fi film of all time.",

1428,30 December 1998,DWR-2,10, Reflection /Foreshadowing of society in 1979,"This movie really scared the #@%* out of me. But there is a deeper meaning in this film that really makes it great. 1979 saw the beginning of the de-regulation in government/business relations, as well as our first experience with the threat of problems with nuclear power plants. The "" Alien"" represents nuclear power as a dangerous, and unpredictable resource that we need to study more before using it more freely. Risking the  lives of the entire crew for the good of the company foreshadowed the loss of union strength in business during the 1980's. Movies are always a direct reflection of society, if you're willing to open your mind and think a little.",
1429,10 November 2002,Kaitain4791,9, Awesome,"23 years on (at the time or writing), this film still looks and feels magnificent. The ""total environment"" approach to the design of sets and artifacts gives the film a level of realism rarely bettered.

1430,20 April 1999,betoneri,8, Alien after 20 years. Still in the best Sci-fi movies.,"Alien is one classics Sci-fi movies. Magistrally directed by Mr. Scott and well performed by the actors. The movie represents the darkness and the paranoia in a claustrophobic space ship; giving the idea that once in the ship the alien entity, is no way to scape. Rydley Scott takes the darkest images of H. R. Geiger, and transforms that images to horrorific ""tour de force"" with paranoic suspense.",

1432,18 August 1999,Neil-79,10, The best film of all time...,"When this film first came out, I was immediately fascinated; not only by the strong visuals but also the perfect ensemble acting.  John Hurt's death scene alone is a classic.  I watch this film at least once a year and it never seems dated and is never boring.  This is probably the film which made me watch movies on another level; not only as mere entertainment, but as something more; something to appreciate and savor like a great meal or fine wine.  Friends constantly tell me ""yeah, but 'Aliens' was better"" (much like the people who post here) and I am always telling them why it is a very good film, but totally different from the classic original.  Not since ""King Kong"" has a movie monster so indelibly and originally burned itself into our collective psyche - watch ""Alien"" again (with the lights out).",

1435,26 December 2000,Pasel,7, Review of a film about the dangers of being too curious,"The movie is quite good if you know it's from 1979.At this time they couldn't work with great effects like in the new Alien-films.So with no fantastic effects trying to create a Sci-Fi film where effects are from big importance is difficult.But Scott succeeded, it's one of these movies you know from the first minute on that it's something special.And that's quite right, because through that film Scott created a new genre or at least gave now life to Sci-Fi. Very enjoyable is to buy the Alien-films all together and watch them a weekend through.So you get the story at one piece and don't have to remind yourself everytime new.Also you can see how Sigourney Weaver changes in every film.This shall NOT be promotion, but I did so and was surprised.",
1436,20 October 2003,rhomboid,8," Back in it's day, this movie was a trill!","First, Let me start out by saying that ""ALIEN"" has a special place in my heart...1979 was a fun time for me and this movie was part of that fun!  I will not go into detail about this movie, but I well say that for someone who has not seen this movie and who is under the age of say 25 - 30; might find this movie a bit dated!  Back in 1979, this was the cutting edge of movie effects and movie technology.  You had a good cast of players, and a great director (Ridley Scott) at the helm.  Anyway, I found this movie not so scary of a film as much as I found it a trilling and fun film!  I suggest that if you are interested in viewing this movie for the first time, or again for the first time, to wait for it's re-release at the theater this coming winter.  I find movies of this sort (space type films) are always better on the big screen.  I would also like to suggest the movie sequel `Aliens'; directed by James Cameron, who also wrote the story.",

i played tekken for 25 long years and tho i was by far best among my friends and anyone i played against, turns out there are better players than me that went much more deep into tekken and spent much more hours playing
i was so good in playing pool, that good that i started playing with one hand and still winning everyone, until i started playing against pool pro's who again, spent much more time playing than i did
anyway i am that type of person who likes to try everything instead of sticking to one thing forever

When they kill Ash, I was surprised that he was a robot. Sigourney Weaver also did an amazing job acting.It pushed away from what was expected of movies and was proud of it. I liked it because it did not focus on being violent like most horror movies. Instead it focused on being suspenseful. I don't want to spoil too much, but definitely watch it if you like suspense!",

1453,23 September 2003,lambert31,9, Seven people along for a deadly ride...,"Seven people along for a deadly ride, with only four of them driving. Those seven are the crew in Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror film Alien, which was his directorial debut. Let me start with Kane, whom we see first rising from his cryogenic tube like a vampire from a coffin. Man, you're going to have a BAD day. John Hurt (Rob Roy) acted capably in this film; sadly there isn't much for his character to do except die horribly. Kane is the first driver though, and all the crew's sorrows begin with him: a man whose curiosity costs more than just his life. Isn't he lucky to have friends like Lambert, a character apprehensive from the start, and Dallas? Veronica Cartwright (The Birds, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Witches of Eastwick) is flawless in her part, as no one else can seem so realistically terrified. Tom Skerritt does fine as Dallas also, although I've only seen him in this movie. They risk their lives rushing Kane back to the infirmary, carrying him like a corpse, which is fitting since he is already dead. Lambert and Dallas don't know that yet. Their hope is blind. Too bad Ash doesn't have Kane's best interests in mind. This has to be Ian Holm's (The Fifth Element, Fellowship of the Ring) most chilling performance yet! I've said enough. You know how the story proceeds from here.",

1455,1 October 2012,cblakes2015,7, Alien,"Alien is a suspense film about a crew in space investigating life-form on an unknown planet and end up under attack by one of the native species. The movie is full of surprises keeping tensions high throughout the entire movie. Ridley Scott used many different things to make this movie as scary and stressful for the audience as possible. He uses things like lighting and sounds from the alien to keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole film. I was kind of excited before watching this movie because I have seen many suspense films but, never got around to watching this one before. When looking at it before viewing it, it looked like more of a Sci-Fi movie than a horror movie and that's not really what I'm interested in. After watching Alien I could see that it did have a lot of Sci-Fi elements, obviously with the people in deep space finding an alien that lays eggs inside people that pop out their chests. When looking into it deeper however it's actually a very intense and exciting movie. The fact that the alien had a means of getting around the ship without the crew knowing where he was made the alien that much more frightening. With the alien moving through the air ducts you never know who will be attacked next which really adds to the suspense of the film. Also it added the possibility of the captain going into the air ducts after the alien. This confined quarter trying to find an alien loose in your spaceship is a very scary thought. Having the air ducts for the alien to crawl through really added to the scariness of the movie. Sigourney Weaver was an excellent choice to portrait Ellen Ripley in my opinion. She was a sort of take charge make decisions type of character. It was easy to tell from the beginning that Ripley was the one who knew what was going on and made the smart choices for every situation. The way Weaver played the character knowing what's best and taking charge really gave the made the character more relatable, and made the movie as a whole a lot better. When they let the alien in to the ship you could really see that she was concerned and didn't want this to happen. Weaver was a great actress to cast for this character. In Alien the lighting was used especially in toward the end of the movie to really enhance the experience of the movie. This is very much the case when they are trying to escape the main ship and set off the self-destruct action on the ship. This causes the lights to go on and off constantly like a strobe light so you can't really see what's going on. Due to this you never know if the alien is right next to her or if he's not even in the shot. Also the sounds of the alien kind of added to the movie as well. Whenever you here the screeching sound of the alien you know something bad is going to happen. This was made clear when Ripley is on the escape ship thinking she got away then you hear the alien. This is a very creepy knowing that its close quarters now. These two aspects combined make for a very scary experience. The way in which the alien got into the ship is very scary as well. Having an unknown creature stick to your face and lay eggs inside you is weird enough, and then having it burst through your chest makes it even worse. I think using this instead of having the alien sneak onto the ship or something makes it so much scarier. This just isn't what is expected and really grosses out and scares the audience. Considering the fact that this movie was made in nineteen seventy-nine the alien creature is very realistic. This is what makes the movie believable and keeps the audience interested. This has to be very hard with Sci-Fi movies because none of the things happening in these movies have ever happened and probably never will happen. Looking at how the alien appears though helps the audience to see this as a real thing that could happen. When watching this movie just keep in mind that it's all fake and will probably never happen.",

I saw this in the theater on wide screen as it should be seen for the first time in 1979 & from the first opening credits i knew i was about to witness an event...not much really scares me in movies any more but this film did the trick...it was the first for many unforgettable scenes that once seen are permanently etched in your consciousness forever ..thats what makes a classic.....the old alien ship on the planet...the face hugger ..the birth scene ..& the last 17 minutes of sheer edge of seat terror & excitement with Ripley & the alien..the movie scared the living s..t out of me...a total movie experience to be savored,

The plot is incredible and has a major twist that you find out as you keep watching. The plot makes a big opportunity for prequels to be made (Prometheus and Alien Covenant). This is the best film of its series (Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 And Alien Resurrection).

This movie has inspired me in ways I can't explain And wouldn't try to I only wish it's sequels could understand what it was Why it's so great. Don't get me wrong I love aliens but the pacing changes the tone in a way that makes it not the same. I can't explain what I feel but this movie made me the man I am pls give it a chance it deserves that at least. Thanks for listening and sorry for the spelling now go to LV426 and enjoy it,

1467,8 March 2023,mrcthedj,8, Holds Up Well,Recently did a re-watch on this. My wife had never seen it before. We were both riveted. This is great science fiction (that just happens to be a slasher movie set in outer space). I see a lot of kiddies giving it a low rating. It's not a Marvel super hero movie. Please don't go into it expecting that sort of vapid entertainment. This is for a thinking audience. Stick with the super hero stuff if you can't take more than three seconds of silence on screen.,
1468,18 July 2018,milosucro,10, A Game-Changer,"Over the decades, this movie has definitely set itself apart from other sci-fi and horror/thriller flicks. The design of the xenomorph is entirely unique for the genre; it combines the fear of a parasite that can consume one from the inside, and later a sophisticated predator that hunts its prey relentlessly. The sense of fear, confinement and paranoia adds to the suspense that is built up gradually. The viewer is given time to get comfortable with the setting and learn the personalities of the crew members before things are thrown into chaos, which allows you to be invested in their survival. Sigourney Weaver's performance is excellent and has you rooting for her on the edge of your seat for the entire adrenaline-infused viewing.",

1471,9 September 1998,Ice-13,9, A hit thriller,"Alien is a very intense and interesting flick, which can really capture the imagination of a person, based on the viewers ability to focus and believe that what they're seeing is real. This was one of the sci-fi shockers I watched in the past that is just, unforgettable.  Based on H. R. Geiger's idea and realization of the alien creature, director Ridley Scott and author Dan O'Bannon create an adrenaline rockin' thriller, which I believe cannot and has not been surpassed.  The introduction of Sigourney Weaver as character W.O. Ripley, was one of the best things that could have happened to Weaver, and helped make her the star that she is today.  SFX in the movie won it an  Oscar in 1980, and assists in leaving the viewer a little anxious after the end, but with a clear idea of the memorable title, especially if viewed and read about in it's original ENTIRETY, and not the directors cut.  *Same things can be said about it's 3 ensuing sequels. Still a sweet movie in my opinion.",
1472,15 July 2000,Scaramoosh,10, The most perfect movie.......ever.,"'Alien' is, and has been for some time now, my favourite movie of all time, so far.  Personally, I can't fault this film.  It's very frightening, the tension which mounts through the film is incredible.  The direction is excellent, the acting convincing, although Sigourney Weaver seems pretty self-conscious at the beginning of the film, but I like it that she is! The music is excellent, the special effects fantastic considering when this film was made, and the script is top notch.  With most films, I might come away saying, ""very good, except...."" and then name a flaw or two.  To me, 'Alien' is flawless.  I've seen it countless times in the past (the first time when I was only 14 yrs old and too scared to watch the end!), but these days about once a year is enough.  As far as sci-fi goes, it don't get much better than this.",
1473,15 July 2000,robertx,10, An atmospheric sci fi that is really scary,A great cast of actors.  Some VERY tense scenes (air shafts- looking for Jones),
1474,12 April 2001,sammy-70,10, The first TRUE horror film in outer space,"I remember going to the theater to see this movie with a date while I was in high school.  After the movie, my right arm had distinct fingernail impressions caused by my date's reactions to the unbelievable sights and sounds of the movie.  For 45 minutes, nothing happens.  I mean - absolutely nothing.  Then, out of the blue - POW! You are hooked, but you don't quite know by what, and it will take another 10 minutes to find out.  And once you do, the queasiness begins.  But again, Ridley Scott is not about to let you off that easily.  Time builds to allow your queasiness to settle - until (when else?) it is time to eat.  What follows is the most unexpected and incredible appearance by another creature in moviedom.  Your emotion turns from shock to suspense, and then to terror, and finally frustration.  But just when you want to scream . . . you realize that ""in space, no can hear you scream"".  :)  Four out of Four Stars.",
1475,22 November 2000,yoyo-22,10, Too bad movies aren't this good nowadays............,Rating 10/10! Alien is superb entertainment and definitely should not be missed by anyone who appreciates artistic qualities in filmmaking. Spectacular special effects and mind-boggling special touches make this beyond the farthest of beyond. I recommend the Alien Legacy tape. It's simply fascinating!,
1476,29 August 2006,kasper-s-1,10," Alien,it's the best movie in this world!",This movie is so cool!!!It is the best movie ever made!The ALIENS are so good made,
1477,2 April 2020,washyoureyestwice,10, Solid Gold.,"This is without a doubt the best Sci-fi movie I've ever seen. Even for the 70's, they did a really good job with sound and puppetry (although, I guess puppetry was a lot of people's specialty in the 70's film industry), but the amount of detail they put into the sets (particularly the Nostromo) is nothing short of incredible. Final Rating: a RESOUNDING 10/10",
1478,16 December 2019,gabripotu,8, A masterpiece of yesterday,"The movie is honestly great, but you know this already. It's a difficult topic for me since I usually hate sci-fi movies, but this one's definitely an exception. The cast is great: everyone has their way of being likeable. Sigourney Weaver in the lead role is spectacular and the special and practical effects are, too, in particular talking about a 1979 movie. The screenplay is great and proves you how the problem is not the Alien's cruelty, but are actually human stubbornness and ignorance. The way the horror is brought up is through a daunting feeling of anxiety and a very low number of jumpscares, which makes this way more enjoyable. The main twist about one of the crew members is also great. My only critiques are: the use of the cat, which should have not been there in the first place, as a huge plot advancement mechanic, the size of the spaceship which is just exaggerate for that number of people and for them to always be in the same areas and where the Alien is and the, in my opinion, underwhelming finale (honestly I would have ended it 5 minutes earlier).",
1479,7 April 2001,Mr_Akuji,10, Great film!,"Definatly one the greatest sci-fi films ever made! It's amazing alien designs (made possible by none other than the talents of surealist H.R. Giger) are what made the film a milestone in modern sci-fi film making. Another contributing factor is the astounding performances of the actors who portrayed the doomed crew of the Nostromo. The haunting atmosphere and attitude of the film is another thing that makes this film so memorable. This is a definate must-see for any sci-fi fan! This is an amazing visual spectacle that will amaze you, scare you, and even shock you!",
1480,1 September 2013,anshuman-manur,7, Captivating thriller but fails to address bigger questions...,"At the outset, I want to say that although I rate the film 7/10, I was disappointed by it. When I first came across the film, its title, its filmmaker and its general acclaim by the public, I was looking forward to something completely different. What I mean is that there are so many complex questions that the idea of extraterrestrial life throws up, and Alien does not as much as attempt to even pose such questions. What is man's place in the universe? What can the form of a living thing (here, the alien's) teach us about being? Science-fiction is a particularly potent literary form to address such questions. And although I sense the influence of that giant of science-fiction cinema, the one that so magically haunts us with its depiction of man's supposed evolution (yes, I speak of 2001: A Space Odyssey), Alien is nothing more than a thriller that capitalises on its setting in deep space, on the terror of being so far away from home.",
1481,21 May 2020,suzannerussell-64687,9, This is a classic,It has always been one of my top five horror franchises that I watch all the time I wasn't born when this movie first came out so it took me to the age of 10 to finally see and first I thought it was okay but I was very young then after watching it again along with Aliens I like it. Now it is slow but that makes even more tense you dont know what will happen around the next corner the chest buster was shocking but it was even more interest about how it grew with out even Ash knowing. And Watching the 2003 Directors cut I get the extra scenes i really like how Ridley Scott put the extra scenes back into the movie that should never have been cut.,
1482,19 June 2020,rcstarmaker,9," Great film, but missing music might have made it better.","When I started watching Alien, I immediately recognised a film ahead of its time in terms of artistic design and dark tone. The actors were ideally cast and the claustrophobic set was utilised to desired effect.",
1483,10 August 2008,Stachu_71,10, Why so bad whereas so good?,"Most people didn't get the point of that film. When I talked to some of my friends (one of them movie goer), they found that film rather boring. Why? Good question. They said (most of them), that movie didn't consist of any unexpected loud noises, bunch of aliens popping out from the corridor, but what took me aback the most, was one of them saying (it was the movie goer) that blurring screen near the end of the film was completely unnecessary and he didn't know what was the point of it...Yes, yes. Nowadays people expect not a real horror movie (alien, psycho, exorcist, the thing), but some shitty picture depicting lot of blood, violence, and tons of cadavers being slain like flies. For me, it was the PERFECT horror movie. Everything in it was tied in well, everything was real (theoreticaly it could happen), and the anxiety was continuously bottling up from the very beginning (that I found the best). Plus the awesome music, special effects (1979!!!), and one, however great, twist. All that gives you the film that will occupy your mind for a lot more you'd expect.",
1484,19 June 2001,davsjo,8, A great movie!,Without a doubt the best movie in the Alien series. I know many people tend to like Aliens (1986) much more. I'm not one of them. It's hard to beat this classic. Even though the special effects aren't quite as good as in the later movies it's much better. You don't get the same feeling from the other movies. Many people seem to focus too much on special effects and not about the story and that's a shame. You don't want to miss this one. It's a movie everyone should have seen!,
1485,19 August 2021,imadeanaccounttoreviewonemovie,10, In depth review of my first viewing of alien,"Upon my first viewing of alien, I found the visuals very appealing, the storytelling and composition superb. The writing does have a few flaws, like never explaining the main character's obsession with some cat, but the rest makes up for it. I did find the strobe lights towards the end quite jarring.",
1486,4 September 2021,kevmarsh-90693,10, Original and Stunning,"For a sci-fi film to hold up so well after 42 years, is a testament to the excellent writing and filmmaking executed in this classic film. The film is beautifully shot, well-cast, and acted. The tension builds throughout the film with a powerful ending. I can only imagine how amazing the theater experience would have been to view this classic Horror/Sci-Fi in 1979.",

1488,1 November 2021,AlexanderMCJ,8, A real classic sci-fi movie,"Sometimes a bit predictable but still a classic and an enjoyable movie. The beginning is pretty good and the story is well made however the death scenes are a bit lame except for one person. The design of the alien is really cool and scary. The later part of the movie was my favourite because it was very intense and exciting because anything could happen. Alien has a few plot twists which i like and the character are funny and have personality. Overall the movie is pretty good and I do recommend watching it, partially because it a classic but its also an enjoyable movie.",
1489,3 June 2002,msoneal,9, The only scary movie I've ever seen,This movie is good old fashioned suspense in a new setting. This movie is the only movie in 30 years that I have ever jumped at in surprise. And I knew what was coming. I think it is way better than the over-the-top Aliens with monsters everywhere.,

1491,22 March 2022,jozvex,8, Very good with a side of ugh!,"I really enjoyed it! There's a lot to like. Visually it's fantastic, the cast is great, it's tense and creepy. In the first half I struggled as some of the dialogue is quite dumb and makes the characters seem pretty annoying and inept, despite how smart you'd need to be to run a spacecraft. Stick through it though! Once Sigourney becomes the focus it gets much better. Her character seems like the only smart one and her acting is great and easily carries the rest of the movie. This was my first time watching and gets me excited to continue the franchise.",
1492,1 February 2022,marcusisanewok,8, Finger picking anxiety,Finger picking anxiety. The contemporary style of effects competes with the modern standard in an outstanding thriller that cements Ridley as a legend from the start.,
1493,26 February 2023,smudgesmileybilly,9, To get the full effect you needed to watch it then,The problem with most reviews nowadays is that you don't get the full effect of watching it in the cimema back in the day not knowing what to expect.,

1495,24 June 2002,togaman,10, Perfect,"Just as the alien in question is the perfect killing machine, ""Alien"" the movie is the perfect science fiction movie. The story, dialogue and acting are superb. The special effects (pre-digital) hold up well by today's standards.  There is no weak link in the ensemble cast and Sigourney Weaver is the consumate protagonist. The set was almost a character of its own and was much copied but never equalled in later, lesser movies.",
1496,17 March 2009,l-condley,9, So much more than a horror film.,Alien is a film that has been summed up in the past as a slasher film in space. This summation does absolutely no justice to the mastery of Ridley Scott's iconic sci-fi. To a certain degree the plot outlines a standard horror set-piece i.e. a motley group of humans find themselves trapped with a nasty beasty intent on gorging itself on them. But there is so much more to admire in all aspects of what is Ridley Scott's finest film (in my humble opinion.),
1497,27 October 2014,detti131,6, Classic,It's one of the most classic movies what have been made. When I was kid it was a very interesting movie and alien was the most known movie character. But now 20 years later it feels like very boring movie. The most interesting part of the movie was when the crew visited the planetoid and found that big giant sitting on the command chair. But rest of the movie was just about sneaking around and it is very low tempo till the end. Plot is very simple and boring.,
1498,20 March 2020,huffman_g,8, Solid Classic Sci-Fi,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The effects are well done, considering this movie is 40 years old. This is a very action-filled and suspenseful movie. Definitely check it out, if you like that sort of thing. The aliens are pretty terrifying. The aliens that grab onto the astronauts' faces are sooo disgusting. Overall, it's a very-well-put-together movie. If you enjoy audiobooks, there's one available called Alien: Out of the Shadows. It's very similar to this movie, and it's very-well done.",

1500,20 November 2002,sh24jame,10, Brilliant,"It's more than well done combination of great acting,directing and a script. The movie is supposed to be considered just a thriller,while it covers much wider spectrum of genres. The basis is a science fiction story, yet here the plot is much more phylosofic and scince fiction is only a frame coming to emphasize the main ideas which are universal, such as : Human existanse and its price,the essence  of difference between human and organic,which is not only the intellect (see the sciene of Ash's ""death"").",
1501,26 December 2004,Slomojowa,10, Overrated: A Bleak Argument,"I think that the ultimate example of futility is the use of terms such as overrated, simply because there are obviously no axiomatics at work in the preferences of a film. I would also like to comment on how this reviewer delved too deeply, for his own sake ,into the cytology of this particular film. The intent put into the atmosphere of the film was never to instill fear by usage of the character development, but rather use the atmospheric moodiness to surround the viewer with a unsettling claustrophobic dissonance from this realm. I cannot fathom why people take even the most infinitesimal sum of time to dwell on a film they just don't happen to like because of biased opinions, let alone put their opinions out into the public.",
