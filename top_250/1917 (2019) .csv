0,13 April 2021,TheLittleSongbird,10," ""He travels the fastest who travels alone""","There are some great WW1 films out there, the granddaddy of them all in my view being 1930's 'All Quiet on the Western Front'. Also appreciate many of the actors here, though they are in cameo roles, and Sam Mendes as a director (of the films of his seen, almost all, 'Spectre' is the only one to not do much for me). Roger Deakins and Thomas Newman are masters in their field, Deakins is one of the best cinematographers in the business and Newman's score for 'Road to Perdition' is a favourite.",/
1,10 January 2020,boblipton,8, Another Day In One Long Take,"The command has realized that the Germans have pulled back for a trap on a British offensive. The telephone lines are cut, and the only way to get the orders through to the colonel commanding the offensive is to send two soldiers through the lines. One of them has special incentive. His elder brother is a soldier in the attack. If it goes through, 1600 men, will be wiped out for no purpose.... including the soldier's brother.",r
2,10 April 2020,planktonrules,9, Reasonably accurate in showing the hell that is war.,"I am not particularly a huge fan of war films. Much of it is because they too often glamorize war or present bullet-proof heroes who are anything but realistic. However, I am glad I watched ""1917"" because neither of these problems exist in the story plus it's a very good depiction of war and the awfulness of it...particularly WWI.",e
3,12 December 2019,aivilovee,9, An achievement,"It's a stunning watch from start to finish. The amount of work that went into this film alone deserves your attendance, and even then, the story never stalls, and has a fair balance between war and humanity, and has some of the most incredible camera work I've seen in a while. It's hands down my favorite film of 2019.",v
4,7 January 2020,diegosays,10, We're living in such wonderful times...,"1917 is a poem.
Is the most deep, impressive and realistic way of seeing what kinds of things happened in WWI.
This movie made me leave the movies with tears in my eyes as if I have had a time travel experience to the World War I, and then waking up and realizing how wonderful are the times we are living in.
1917 is a must see movie for everyone.",i
5,6 December 2019,eelen-seth,8, A technical masterpiece,"Sam Mendes' war drama is set during World War I and very personal to him, as it tells a story his grandfather used to tell him when he was still a young lad. Dedicated to Mendes' hero, this drama cuts deep when we join two young soldiers on a mission to deliver a message that could possibly save thousands of fellow combatants.",e
6,10 January 2020,allentyson-89230,10, Don't listen to critics!,Don't listen to the critics saying this movie is boring. This movie is one of the most tense and exciting movies I've seen in years. Amazing cinematography and overall amazing experience of a movie.,w
7,17 January 2020,RforFilm,8," 1917 recruits you to experience a war journey done in an impressive ""one-shot"" style that I can't say i've seen before","Saving Private Ryan, 30 Seconds over Tokyo, Patton, Inglorious Bastards, The Great Escape and Schindler's List are only a few of the countless movies about World War II that have been made. In fact, many are still made today. So why haven't there been a lot of movies about the first World War? I think it comes down to exactly what was being fought for and what it meant for everyone. Everyone can agree that Nazism is bad and running a nation as a dictatorship robs everyone of their freedom. Germany was a common enemy that everyone would want to fight, similar to a simple film's goal of good against evil.",/

9,5 January 2020,tgrafflin,10, I Wanted to Hate This Hauntingly Beautiful Gift of a Movie,"I sat in a packed yet silent theater this morning and watched, what I believe to be, the next Academy Award winner for the Best Picture. I'm not at all a fan of war movies but I am a fan of great movies....and 1917 is a great movie.
I have never been so mesmerized by set design and direction, the mass human emotion of this film is astonishingly captured and embedded magically in the audience. It keeps running through my mind...the poetry and beauty intertwined with the raw misery of war.
Treat yourself....see this movie!",w
10,12 January 2020,andrewroy-04316,8," A technical marvel, 1917's one-shot conceit is immersive and affecting","1917 is a very good film in general, but it's the way it's shot that marks it as an artistically cutting-edge film. It brings the technical excellence of Dunkirk, with great war sets and brutally realistic depictions of the intensity of war, but intelligently turns to a humanist angle in telling a simple story of two men trying to help their country's men. There are no bad elements of 1917, but it's the phenomenal execution of the one-shot technique that makes it great. The tracking shots in the trenches made me realize how much less immersive it is to be constantly cut to the front of the next shot, rather than seeing the path the characters take. Given that it's this one epic journey, it is fitting to go on it with Schofield the whole way. The colors and big war shots (especially Schofield running across the war zone to reach the captain and him jumping into the river) were gorgeous. The score is essential, ratcheting tension up quickly in scenes like the rat trip wire and also calming it down in personal scenes like one character's death and when Schofield meets the baby and woman. War is so extreme and all-encompassing that it's truly difficult for any film to accurately capture it, but 1917 belongs up there with the best efforts. It is a film of brutality and loyalty, but above all it's a beautiful work of art about one of the ugliest subjects known to man.",5
11,4 January 2020,gkdidaxi,10, Words fail me,"This film is overwhelming. I have nothing further to add, other than the compelling need for eternal remembrance to those who sacrificed their lives in any way, we can not fathom. We, citizens of any country, today, should feel ourselves lucky and blessed to exist. A Happy New Year to all. George from Hellas. NB: do not give it a second thought; watch it; even if this genre is not your cup of tea. After all, it is much more than a feature film. It's a massive dedication to unselfishness. Do yourself a favour and watch it. And then watch it once more.",3
12,13 December 2019,dr-peter-coldwell,10, Review from a combat veteran.,"Last night COL Ferry and I (COL Coldwell, both USA) were able to watch the new WWI film, 1917, before it has national release. It is a cinematographic feast for the eyes, long expansive shots that follow the protagonists as they execute their mission. It does not hide the horrors that existed in trench warfare, it shows them for their brutality and abundance. (My great uncle died as a consequence of his service fighting in the trenches, mustard gas poisoning). In many ways it reminded me of Saving Private Ryan.",9
13,1 January 2020,Instant_Palmer,10, Visually Stunning Academy Award Winner for Cinematography (and 6+ more nominations likely),"Director/Writer Sam Mendes and Cinematographer Roger Deakins produce the best war film of the 2010s. Truly stunning visually, the story of two soldiers' race to the front lines of WWI under direct orders to deliver the message to stop 1,600 British soldiers from entering a trap set-up by German forces to massacre them, keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, and inside the soldiers' boots, through amazing Mendes/Deakins directing/cinematography techniques.",6

17,28 December 2019,thompson12001,10, One of the greatest war movies of all time,This is hands down one of the greatest war movies to ever hit the silver screen along with being very unique. The hell of the WWI battlefield is a subject that hasn't been covered in a long time and Mr. Mendes executes this perfectly. A movie like this couldn't have been made 50 years ago but with today's advances in film making along with a large studio budget Mr. Mendes takes us through an adventure every bit as harrowing as Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line.,/
18,4 December 2019,jashminocha,8," Riveting, hauntingly beautiful and mesmerizing","The entire movie made to look like it's shot at one single take, this is possible because of extraordinary talented 14 times Academy Award nominee cinematographer Roger Deakins. This man is a genius, the movie is shot beautifully. it is mesmerizing to a watch world war 1 movie like it is happening right in front of you. The pacing is phenomenal. The only real flaw in the movie is that there are no great character building movements like other war movies but that is also intentional because, the main intention or motive is to save lives and not focus on characters in the movie and that works.",?

21,18 January 2020,classicsoncall,10," ""We need to keep movin'. Come on!""","Impressively filmed, the movie's staging, set design, lighting, cinematography and choreographed action sequences are all top notch and deserving of recognition. I should mention the soundtrack as well, which complements the story as two young soldiers progress their way through No Man's land to deliver an urgent message to a distant unit that faces annihilation. The film makers wisely selected two relatively lesser know actors for the film's protagonists so that celebrity wouldn't get in the way of the story. I was somewhat surprised that Dean-Charles Chapman, portraying Lance Corporal Blake, didn't make it to the end of the movie. His death before mid-picture left Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) the unenviable task of making his way alone across enemy held territory to complete an almost impossible mission. Among a number of astonishing scenes, I was most impressed with the German plane crash that came within inches of claiming the lives of both men. Though the picture claims it's status as being filmed in one continuous tracking shot, there appear at least one or two instances where that might not have been the case, one in particular being quite obvious, even if masked rather well. Even so, the technique may very well earn Sam Mendes the Best Directing Oscar, along with Cinematography and Production Design. The trenches and battleground scenes are particularly impressive, especially near the finale in which the British unit prepares for it's assault. In any case, the picture stands as a worthy achievement in film making, and is especially recommended.",f
22,12 January 2020,CtlAltDel,7, Style over substance,"Try and see it on the big screen. The 'one continuous shot' method works very well thru the trenches but is probably not necessary elsewhere, apart from a few chase scenes. I came out of the theatre feeling overwhelmed but found I'd just about forgotten the film by the next day. Why was that? Because you never actually make an emotional connection with the main characters. Actually, there is no real character development. It's gripping at times but more a case of style over substance - worth it just for the style though.",_
23,10 January 2020,UniqueParticle,10, Mesmerizing art,"Exhilarating from start to finish, well deserving of the Golden Globe wins! A masterpiece I'm so glad I got to see in RPX. So well filmed with beautiful lighting, suspense, incredible action, and cinematography is top notch. I loved everything about 1917 especially the exciting night sequence and the I'm happy with everything that happens.",=
24,28 February 2021,Pro Jury,4, Interesting visually but it does not work well as a full length movie,"Like most WWI and WWII movies made today, this one looks like modern day actors playing soldier, all lacking military bearing, speech, phrasing and decorum of the time. If the viewer thinks to ask, what brand hair oil from the year 1917 might these two message runners use, the answer at the shampooed non-oiled fluffy hair is, of course, none because men today do not use hair cream. The movie is 1917, and clearly not made in 1917.",t

27,5 August 2020,Hitchcoc,10, Haunting!,"Shades of Apocalypse Now. This film is a flawless integration of music, tension, cinematography, and an allegorical story. There are physical and intellectual labyrinths that this poor soldier must meander through. The two men are the usual cannon fodder used to manage a nearly hopeless task. When one is lost, the other cannot hold back. There are many close calls which teach us that at times one must chuck aside fear and endure. The trenches of World War I were like mazes, with death running through them. I have a hard time with war movies. I think this film will be remembered as we move forward in time.",u

30,17 April 2021,clanciai,10, Hauntingly beautiful nightmare of running the gauntlet through the First World War,"There are many excellent films of the first world war, almost without exceptions, but still I must hold this one as the best one I have seen. It is perfectly realistic all the way, everything is convincing, this is as far from Hollywood you could possibly come, and yet, for all its realism of bloody terror and deaths without numbers and shocking tragedies all the way, there are tremendous moments of beauty, the cinematography is more than perfect all the way, with neckbreaking contrasts between tragedy and humour, nightmare horrors and beauty, while the sequence from the burning city in the night stands out in an almost Tarkovsky-like splendor of magic and wonder, while perhaps the most unforgettable episode is the curious story of the milk, the woman and her unknown baby. In brief, this will stand out for all time.",
31,20 November 2020,Sergiodave,10, Intensely moving,"A quite incredible and powerful war movie. Some people liken it to Saving Private Ryan, but that shows the horror for 40 intense minutes, whereas this movie will affect you far beyond the closing credits. The acting, script and sound are all superb, but the cinematography from Roger Deakins is on another level. A modern day masterpiece.",
32,17 January 2020,Pairic,9, Powerful War Film,"1917: The trenches are narrow but crowded, some soldiers on one side waiting to go over the top, some crouched on the other side, eating, smoking, crying, in shock, petting a terrier. When you're moving fast through a trench system tempers are short when you bump into troopers, they are likely bereaved of friends, seeing their mates lose limbs. Blake (Dean Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) are on a mission to inform two isolated battalions of the Devonshires to call off an attack due the next morning, the Devons will be advancing into a trap. The stakes are higher for Blake, his brother is in one of the battalions. The messengers cross no mans land, bodies caught on the barbed wire, rats gnawing on corpses, dodging snipers, booby-traps once they reach the abandoned German trenches. Watching an aerial dogfight. This is truly a journey into the heart of darkness for Blake and Schofield.",
33,14 January 2020,phil-83737,9, Very Good and Realistic,"I enjoyed this film. At times I found it very frustrating, without spoiling it by that at times I mean that, you want the main characters to take a certain action and when they fail to do so or do something else you think just do this or that. The film is beautifully filmed and the war and battle scenes very realistic. The horror of the trenches is recreated but I'm sure in reality it was much much worse. Well worth seeing and worthy of the plaudits that have been bestowed upon it.",
34,1 May 2021,brchthethird,10, War on a human scale,"For all of the adrenaline rushes and vicarious thrills that can be had with a well-calibrated action/war film, the best ones invariably focus on the human drama instead of mindless carnage. And in the tradition of the best war movies, 1917 does this exceptionally well while still delivering the thrills and tense moments one expects from this type of cinema. I don't remember being this affected by a war movie since probably SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (to which, in a small way, this owes a small debt). When it comes down to it, Marvel and DC and all the others can keep their world-at-stake existential crises because the intimacy and emotional gravitas of personal relationships is where it's at. This is filmmaking on a human scale.",

Kudos to Mendes and Deakins,"On April 6, 1917 in northern France, two British soldiers are assigned to deliver a message to another British regiment requesting that they call off an attack against German soldiers: an attack that would jeopardize the lives of those in the regiment.

37,30 January 2020,redrobin62-321-207311,9, Should Do Well At The Oscars.,"The only reason I didn't give 1917 a 10 is because the lead actor had the personality of a piece of chalk. He looked almost as dead as the bodies that were strew around him. Or maybe that was the point and I'm missing it. In any case, the cinematography was worth the price of admission alone. Compared to the other films up for Oscars, 1917 should be an easy win. It was full of drama and action, and paced in a strong way that The Academy likes. I wish it luck.",
38,28 December 2020,Leofwine_draca,6," Great visuals, but...","Sam Mendes' 1917 is, like DUNKIRK before it, a visually impressive but ultimately hollow viewing experience. I mean, I love tracking shots in cinema, but this is just one after another and the effective becomes diluted and underwhelming after a time. The film is at its best when the characters are picking their way through labyrinthine trenches in some stunning visual moments, and there are some CGI-aided set-pieces which are phenomenal too. A great film to look at, then, which brings to life the battlegrounds of WW1 in a way that few films can. A shame that there's virtually no story to go with the visuals. Mendes decided to do the writing himself, which was a mistake, and the characters are dull and paper-thin despite the actors trying their best. There's suspense in the first half, then a great twist, but this proves to be the highlight of the film as things go downhill afterwards. The nadir is the bit where the protagonist forgets his mission to coo at a baby for ten minutes. At this point it's just treading water until the end thankfully comes.",

40,17 January 2020,Turfseer,8, Riveting World War I spectacle proves purist critics wrong!,"Generally the majority of the reviews of 1917 have been positive. But one of the chief arguments against the film among the negative reviews is that somehow director Sam Mendes has sanitized the war-it's described as an ""empty spectacle"" or designed in effect as ""eye candy"" for ""thrill seekers.""",

43,16 January 2020,mitchell5954,8, A New Film Experience,"1917 is the latest Oscar bait war movie to come out, though this time set in World War 1. Most of these films like to be set in World War 2 or Vietnam, or even Iraq. The only other film in recent memory set in WWI is Wonder Woman, which barely counts as a war movie. I'm personally not the biggest fan of war movies. They can get boring, and many of them tend to feel the same. The last war movie I saw in theaters was Dunkirk, which everyone adored except me. I thought movie was a boring slog. There are some war films I really like though, such as Apocalypse Now and We Are Soldiers. The ones I enjoy the most tend to be ones like Wonder Woman and Overlord where the war is just the backdrop. It isn't the main story. Apocalypse Now could fall into that category as well.",

51,29 December 2019,rockman182,8, 1917 (2019),I finally found a war film that I absolutely love. 1917 is the latest effort from a very quality filmmaker in Sam Mendes. Sam Mendes has never made a film that I didn't like and so seeing a new war film from him was something I was going to welcome with open arms. This film from opening frame is an absolute technical and emotional journey. Its worth a watch in the cinemas while you can and something I am looking to go see again when I can.,
52,2 February 2020,Kingslaay,8, One of the best war films I have ever seen,"1917 is a beautifully made film from start to finish. It never waivers in its momentum. The filming techniques are great and capture the mood well. The Direction is great, it scores well in realism. There are no over the top moments and it builds up well. So when we have some pivotal events Mendes shows and allows us to experience moments. There is also an emotional payoff in the end. The acting is top notch and brought home well by a good cast. A truly great film that doesn't try too hard but simply delivers. 8/10",

This is a movie that must be seen and must be seen on the biggest screen. And prepare to be immersed in what has to be said the cinematic experience of the year. This has to seen by the young generation now so they can witness what many of their age sacrificed for freedom and democracy. Their comradeship and the sense of duty. This film had me gripped from beginning to end with some superb performances and worthy of oscars. I would also add as an ex serving soldier that I was impressed with the attention to details although there were some goofs notably pointed out on the site. I would also like to add that this was my feeling and if someone else doesnt feel the film was that good thats there opinion when they then decide to call people names because they dont aspire to their point of view they demean themselves and there review should not be posted - Can IMBD ensure that people posting comments have some decency and respect for people s opinion even if it doesnt reflect theirs and refrain from calling people cretins and brainless,
55,28 January 2020,chong_an,7," Nice action movie, but ...","It has too many questionable historical situations (see the list of goofs). Also, the ""single shot"" cinematography asks us to believe that everything happened in 2 hours, plus the time the soldier was unconscious.",

57,17 March 2020,e-67102-48412,10, Human reflection,"The whole film has a degree of relaxation. The war scorched earth of the broken wall, the deafening artillery fire, and the quiet and beautiful European fertile soil,all the scenes were great. I have to say that Roger Dickins, the ""innocent king"" of Hollywood photographers, gave this film a sense of high-level aesthetics, and even shot the ugly battlefield of World War I with a beauty which we have never seen before. Of course, this film essentially expresses ""anti-war"" . This 1917 tells everyone that war is terrible through the stench of two soldiers, the French women and newborn babies who are lingering in the basement.The film tells everyone that war is terrible and peace is important.",
58,15 January 2020,jackgdemoss,8, To be shown to film students when they study cinematography,"At the time of writing this, 1917 is up for 10 Oscars, fresh off the high of winning best drama at the Golden Globes. I haven't poured into exactly what it is nominated for, but I know that it is up for best picture and best cinematography. Unfortunately, I can't say I agree with the academy on it being a best picture contender. That being said, this is some of the most brilliant cinematography I have ever seen in my life. For the uninitiated, the film is shot in such a way that it seems like it is all done in 1 or 2 scenes. I know some big name films have done this before, but this is my first experience with the style. When you combo that 1 take with the brilliant picture and color that 1917 provides, you end up with a stylish and enthralling story that would have otherwise felt lackluster. Definitely worth a watch and a cinematography Oscar.",

60,13 January 2020,jaredpahl,9, A Harrowing New Way to Experience The Horrors of War and the Thrills of Cinema.,"I hate the word 'gimmick' as it relates to filmmaking. Gimmick is an unconstructive word, something that can be tossed off to cheapen actual visions. 1917 is no ""gimmick movie"". It's an experimental grand slam that takes a chance on a unique visual structure and successfully moves cinema into new directions. The conversation around Sam Mendes' World War One drama has inevitably revolved around its audacious, single-shot framework. That technical feat is worth discussing. But so is the film itself and the way Sam Mendes weaves both camera and story together into a brilliant tapestry of beauty in the most hellish war ever fought.",
61,19 January 2020,jboothmillard,10, 1917,"I was excited about this upcoming war movie for the various trailers and behind-the-clips shown about two months before its release, then it was getting a lot of attention during Awards Season, so I made sure to see it on a big IMAX screen, from BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director Sir Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead, Skyfall). Basically, during the First World War in April 1917, the German army has pulled back from a sector of the Western Front in the north of France. General Erinmore (Colin Firth) briefs two young British soldiers Lance Corporal, Blake (Game of Thrones' Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (Sunshine on Leith's George MacKay). Aerial reconnaissance has confirmed that the Germans are not retreating but have made a tactical withdrawal to their new Hindenburg Line, where they are waiting to overwhelm the attacking British with artillery. With field telephone lines cut, Blake and Schofield are ordered to hand-deliver a message to the Second Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment, calling off their planned attack, which might cost the lives of 1,600 men including Blake's brother Joseph (Bodyguard's Richard Madden). Schofield and Blake cross no man's land and reach the abandoned German trenches. These turn out to contain tripwires, and a rat triggers a planted bomb. The ensuing explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake manages to dig him out. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where they witness a dogfight (an aerial battle). The German plane plunges into the farm and Schofield and Blake save the pilot from burning. Schofield proposes to mercy kill him, having severe injuries, but Blake has Schofield fetch water for the pilot. The pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield, who comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission. Schofield is picked up by a passing British unit, led by Captain Smith (Mark Strong). A destroyed bridge near the bombed-out village, Écoust-Saint-Mein, prevents lorries from crossing. So, Schofield crosses the remnants of the bridge alone. A German sniper across the river in an abandoned house tries to attack him. Schofield tracks down and kills the sniper, only to be knocked out by a ricocheting bullet. It is night when Schofield regains consciousness. He walks through the nearby ruins, when he is spotted by and fired at by a German soldier. Schofield stumbles into the hiding place of a French woman with a baby. She treats his wounds, and he gives her his canned food and his canteen filled with milk from the farm. Schofield leaves and is again spotted by two German soldiers. He strangles one and pushes the one that is too inebriated to stop him. Other soldiers chase him, but he escapes by jumping into a river. Schofield reaches the Battalion as the British attack is due to begin. He fails to stop the start of the attack, so he sprints across the battlefield, after realising that the trenches are too full of soldiers for him to make it to the commander in time. He forces his way into meeting Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) and shows the letter, and the attack is called off. Schofield then locates Joseph, who was among the first attacking wave but is unhurt, and delivers the news of Blake's death. Joseph is upset but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks to write to Blake's mother to tell her about Blake's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Schofield walks away and rests under a nearby tree. It ends with Schofield looking at photos of his loved ones, his two young daughters and a wife at home. Also starring Spectre's Andrew Scott as Lieutenant Leslie, Plus One's Daniel Mays as Sergeant Sanders, Killing Eve's Adrian Scarborough as Major Hepburn, Richard McCabe as Colonel Collins and Billy Postlethwaite, Pete's son as NCO Harvey. The cast are all impressive, the locations, costumes and period detail are authentic and fantastic, but it is the direction by Mendes, camerawork and choreography that deserves the most praise. Movies like Rope, Silent House, and Birdman have used the ""one shot"" technique, filming continuously for long periods, and making near-unnoticeable edits, apart from the obvious fade to black, it is almost impossible to spot the edits, it really plunges the viewer into brutality and horror of the war, a moving, effective and and breathlessly immersive epic war drama. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay for Sam Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Production Design, Best Original Score for Thomas Newman, and Best Sound Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, Outstanding British Film of the Year, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Sound, and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Original Music, and Best Make Up/Hair, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated Best Original Score.

As it seems very few Directors are willing to take on the mud and the blood to produce an original story. However this is a great peice of UK film making, shot on locations such as Salisbury Plain and Scotland. With a stela cast of British actors who are not over stated or underused. The main story is about two characters we are shown this from the start. It's a journey, even a race against the clock. It's tense and slow-burning simmering away. It manages to avoid being predictable and shows the war from our young tommies point of veiw. Its a fresh take on a movie where by the feel of it being shot in one take helps improve the story. This is the best British film about World War One and to me atleast, the best British film released in awhile.",

With recent releases like Hacksaw Ridge or Dunkirk, my faith in the genre is always rejuvenated. Well, 1917 is yet another war film to come along and surprise me.

While Spielberg houses Saving Private Ryan in a groundbreaking, bombastic and terrifying shell to shock a reminder to the world of the sacrifices made in recent history to afford us our freedom and complacency, 1917 is a love letter to those who never gave up, and enlisted a purity of spirit to see their missions to their end.

You find yourself holding your breath as the action plays out. The seed of this film came from the stories Sam Mendes heard his grandfather tell of his time as a message courier in the First World War. The partnership between Mendes and cinematographer, Roger Deakins, to create the movie as one long shot is award worthy and completely elevates the film above its genre.

102,5 February 2020,garethcrook,9, Stunning,"Much has been made about the technical achievements with this film, the editing creating the illusion of the single take and the long, carefully choreographed shots needed to achieve that. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested in this, I stopped counting at five shots though, because of course that's not it's core strength. Granted it does anchor you in the action, you're right there, something not to be sniffed at, but it's the story and those involved that pulls you in. 1917 is as visceral and terrifying as you'd expect. It'll have your jaw quivering on the floor. The story of two young soldiers attempting to get a message, in a race against time, to save hundreds of their like from near certain death, as the Germans plan a surprise attack. Cramped trenches, open countryside, shell beaten towns, people drifting in and out of the narrative. It could've been complicated, but it's the simplicity that shines here and allows the cinematic hopelessness to weigh on you. If there's one thing that films like this share, it's the common portrayal of the pointlessness of war. Lives lost, friends lost, clinging on to hope and humanaity. To be perfectly honest, it's a struggle to put this into words, but it's brutal, amazing, with a brilliant cast all at the top of their game. Stunning.",

107,3 February 2020,RhapsodyReviews,10, Beautiful Film.,"Review:
'1917' is an epic-war film directed by Sam Mendes. It is based in part on an account told to Sam Mendes by his paternal grandfather, Alfred Mendes.
What a beautiful film! It's a stunning watch from start to finish. The amount of work that went into this film alone deserves your attendance, and even then, the story never stalls, and has a fair balance between war and humanity, and has some of the most incredible camera work I've seen in a while.
The film chronicles the story of two young British soldiers (Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay) during World War I who are given a mission to call off an attack doomed to fail soon after the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line during Operation Alberich in 1917.
Without trying to sound like an ass, because the source material for this film is so powerful, but the performances from the two leads were mediocre. They make you care about their characters which is important, but they don't really embrace them. We get small parts from Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch who all bring amazing performances in the little screen time they get.
This is a gorgeous film and it's not just due to the fact that it has amazing editing to look like a single shot, but the cinematography is stunning. There was no slow part in the movie and the audience is enthralled with the journey from the first minute of the film.
Overall, it's easy to see why this film was nominated for Best Picture along with others. It's an incredible film that should be seen by everybody.

The acting in the movie was excellent, especially in the shot of Blake's murder. I wasn't expecting the actor for Blake's character to reach the level required, but he surprised me with an excellent performance, all of the cast performed excellently, and the weak part in the film was the lack of war scenes that were almost. Nothing, the film's story was excellent and exceeded my expectations, the film greatly exceeded my expectations",
111,18 January 2020,mmkkelly,5, Over......Rated,"First let me say the beginning sequences were shot almost perfectly. I was really into the first 20-25 minutes of the movie. I was engaged and thinking about how I was going to tell my sons that if they get a chance to go watch it in the theater. The cinematography and music were gripping.
Then..... as the 2 main characters (solider A and soldier B) get through the initial German traps, and enter into an open field with a cow, a barn, and a pale of fresh milk, the movie goes down hill fast. I was literally laughing at the ridiculousness of the plot and situations. A & B, whose duty it is to transport a message to (2) battalions, warning the battalions are falling into a German trap. Soldier A, has an older brother who is possibly going to be slaughtered in the trap.
With the cow and milk pale in the background, A & B find themselves helping a German airplane pilot out of his burning plane after witnessing an aerial dog fight. This is right after they go through hundreds of yards of seeing their dead countrymen. This is also after they almost get blown up (should have been into 1000 pieces) from booty traps (goonies reference). They help the German guy? Help him? Well, the German guy proceeds to knife Soldier A and kill him. That sequence made me almost leave the theater. I should have because the remaining parts of the movie just got worse. Soldier B still had a message to deliver. B proceeded to get picked up by a convoy of English Soldiers in trucks, who showed up a split second after the cow, milk, plane sequence. As if the trucks showing up was not ridiculous enough, the truck B was in got stuck in the mud moments later. B then convinces 15 or so other soldiers to help him push it out of the mud. Well, they miraculously do this, only to find that they can drive another few hundred yards.
Our message delivering solider B leaves them and then now has to make it past the storm trooper German snipers. I call them storm troopers, because just like storm troopers, they are unable to hit their target. On one of the first sniper situations, the sniper gets hit by a bullet, so B thinks. However, when B goes to check to see if he shot the sniper, he opens the door full swing with his entire body facing the wounded sniper. B then takes a bullet? Or something happens where he gets knocked back down a small flight of stairs. After he wakes, he evades some more storm troopers, then kicks open a small horizontal door to find a woman and a baby, along with a beautiful fire. Thankfully B had fresh milk.
B then leaves as it is getting close to morning. He evades a couple storm troopers only to find a younger storm trooper that he tries to shush. B actually puts his finger up to the storm trooper to shush him? Huh? Was this part of Jedi training? When that doesn't work he chokes him instead. Much to B's surprise, the choking worked better than the shushing. Go figure?
B then runs and runs evading lots of lots of laser guns. Oops sorry, bullets. Then he jumps into a raging river where he smashes his head. Thankfully he has a hard head.
If that is not silly enough, the rivers puts him exactly where he needs to be. Right up to a Battalion sitting in a large circle, listening to a guy singing. UGH, that was so bad.
B still needs to get his dry message that was soaked in the river to the commander. He proceeds to evade lots of bombs from enemy fire to do this. But thankfully B makes it. A cameo by Benedict Cumberbatch as the commander cannot save this flop.
B saves the second wave. B meets A's brother, even though he was in the first wave that was already deployed and supposed to be slaughtered.",
112,9 January 2020,kaneeddy,9, A technical achievement in cinema,"1917, is a war film that adds something completely new and unique to the war genre. The idea of making it look like one take is genius, the cinematography is by far the best of the year, as it immerses you deeply into the film and the characters that make you almost feel like you are there on this journey. The film also has a moving ending that had me mesmerised by the time the credits rolled, that is due to the cinematography and the performances given in the film which were very strong, ending on one of the most nicest shots I have seen this year with a quiet moment that says so much when speaking so little.

What a talent!,
114,3 January 2020,tony-mastrogiorgio,6," Dissenting view: technical achievement, mediocre movie","I have a special fondness for movies that set technical limitations and still achieve full bodied, engrossing story telling. For example, Stephen Knight's Locke is one man, in a car, by himself - and it's riveting. Die Hard takes place (mostly) in a single blinding. 1917 sets a limitation for itself by presenting the movie as a single continuous shot. (It's really at least three, but that's beside the point.)",
115,28 January 2021,maue-19674,7, The First World War was hell - and this is NOT it..,"Sometimes I watch a Film that comes highly recommended - and can find it a little disappointing. '1917' was more than that - it struck me very soon into the Film that, whatever story this was, it was so Fictionalised it bore no semblance to the reality of the Year it was trying to portray. Supposedly the 6th April 1917 two (yes, TWO) British Soldiers are ordered to make their way forward to make contact with a British Unit that is being led into a 'trap' with orders to stop any such assault. I would like to say that there is more to the story than that BUT there isn't. The Film is shot in an apparent 'one continuous take' pseudo-documentary way which occasionally rankles. Make no mistake though, the Cinematography by Roger Deakins FULLY deserves the Oscar it was awarded - it is just that the actual depiction of WW1 and story make no sense whatever. There are real issues - firstly, I never felt that the dialog or the actors were in 'period' being too 21st Century and not Early 20th (for how to do this see 'Gettysburg' where the lines and pace of the actors match the 19th Century). Secondly, the story unfolds across a landscape in which all the elements are there BUT you never get the REAL horror of what it was truly like to fight in this hell-hole. I'm not even going to comment on some of the more absurd aspects. A General in a front-line dugout? Not likely! Save 1600 men from an ambush - by sending TWO? A RAT setting off a booby-trap in a German underground bunker? I could go on but it is pointless.
The only 'enemy' to appear are not even stereotypes, just absurd - a German pilot who survives a flaming crash in his Albatros fighter because our two heroes pull him from the flaming wreckage - immediately decides to pull a knife and attack one of them. What?? The other German soldiers also conform to the 'Star Wars Stormtrooper Complex' - where, despite their military reputation, they simply cannot shoot straight. These would be the same troops who, the previous year, caused horrific casualties to the British on The Somme.
Overall, this is a very well-made piece of Cinema BUT simply is NOT accurate in it's depiction of the 'Great War' and feel an opportunity has been missed.
I even felt that it's award of the Oscar for 'Best Visual Effects' was undeserved as they just weren't good at all (that Oscar should have gone to Alita: Battle Angel).
Once again, too many British Film critics were happy to jump on the Mendes bandwagon calling this a 'masterpiece' - it isn't - Kubrick's 'Paths Of Glory' is WAY superior to this....",

117,10 January 2020,Figgy66-915-598470,10, Outstanding piece of work,"Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester this afternoon - 1917. Throughout the years there have been many films, starring many people, and coming from many different points of view about the First World War. Without taking anything away from those film makers who have come before I can say this was certainly one of the best shot films I have seen for a long time. Following just two soldiers for much of the first half you get a real insight into the life of the individual. Yes we know thousands of men died on both sides but the way this film is shot isolates the very individual struggles and emotions felt by men under direct orders to carry out a seemingly impossible task. Even when surrounded by hundreds of other men there is a sense of aloneness emanating from the screen. I particularly liked how the camera angles changed direction whilst the soldiers were walking, one minute the camera is going backwards, the next it swings round as it allows the men to pass and you almost get a feeling of the cameraman trotting to keep up as they purposely stride along on their mission. Take a moment to look beyond the characters, note the detritus of war lying around, items of clothing, munitions, and so many bodies. Remember this is real, it did happen and note the horror of it all. Lots of big stars in very small parts, look out for Colin Firth, Mark Strong to name a couple.

120,22 December 2021,charbelelaro,10, I wish more movies were made with this much passion,"1917 is directed by Sam Mendes and is a film centred around 2 soldiers in Wold War 1. This movie has received so much praise for its technical achievements. 1917 pulls off the impossible, by creating a wholesome one shot experience. At times the camera will start as handheld then it is hooked on a wire then moved onto a vehicle all in one shot just to capture the journey of the soldiers. This makes for one of the most immersive experiences I have ever had in a film. This is largely due to the cinematographer Roger Deakins. This man is a genius. His subtle camera work makes you truly feel like you are in the moment. The movie feels so real and so authentic, because every shot is always in service of the story. The musical score by Thomas Newman does a great job of feeling so tragic yet beautiful at the same time. This mixture of emotions really overwhelms you when the movie chooses to slow down and reflect. That was my favourite thing about 1917. The movie contains such a powerful story. For most the simple plot and lack of backstory given to us about the characters is a big issue. I've heard many critics say this movie is style over substance. I couldn't disagree more. This movie feels like I am visiting a war memorial and reading about the experience of a soldier during the Great War. 1917 places you right beside the main characters, seeing glimpses and hearing short stories about their life along the journey. This is what it would have been like. These men didn't know each other. It was the way they responded to hardship which would reveal traits of their character. The movie doesn't feed you this information with expository dialogue, but through scenes where the camera just pauses on the soldiers face, while they internally reflect upon all they have been through. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I truly believe 1917 is one of the best war movies ever made. It's subtlety is genius. I haven't been this emotionally moved by a film in over a year. It just requires a bit of deeper thinking and reflection in order to create a personal connection with the characters. I wish more movies were made with this much passion.",

130,17 January 2020,walter-08224,10, Nothing short of breathtaking. A true achievement.,"One of my most anticipated films of 2019 was 1917. What makes this film so grand is it's emotional power, technical innovation, and unforgettable attention to detail. What has attracted so many audiences is the camerawork. The camerawork has been praised so much it might seem like overselling it. If anything, we're underselling it. It is designed as two extraordinarily long, unbroken shots. It puts you directly into the film as though you're the third person in the mission.

The ""continuous shot"" isnt a new concept but it was done brilliantly for a film like this. It's more than a cool technical gimmick...it really makes you feel like you're on this journey too. And the action, and tension just never lets off. Well, at least until the very end. You're just in constant fear and sadness for these guys.

The entire movie uses extraordinarily clever camera tricks to appear as though the entire feature was shot in one take. The way that Sam Mendes and his team shoot the film makes you feel like you're there with the Lance Corporals. You feel their claustrophobia when they're almost buried by a German booby trap, experience the same relief when they reach daylight again and react to gunshots with the same surprise and fear. Towards the end, the shots speed up with the characters, expertly portray their urgency to complete their mission. The stubtle ways the camera shows the harsh realities of war and unnecessary loss of life is masterful and the two main characters are three dimensional, real people, who didn't deserve to be in such a harsh situation. This movie absolutely deserves its best cinematography and best director nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards and I sincerely hope that it wins in both categories. This movie is a must see.",

This is a WW1 movie that is inspired by the director's grandfather's experiences, 'The Autobiography of Alfred H. Mendes 1879_1991'. Sam Mendes is the director and writer, who also directed Spectre, Skyfall and Road to Perdition. The film is shot and edited to make it look like it is one long shot that takes place in real time. It takes place in April of 1917 and follows two British soldiers, George & Dean, who are given an important mission: Get a message to fellow soldiers behind enemy lines that are about to launch an attack against German soldiers. If they fail to notify their fellow soldiers, the Germans will spring a trap on the Allies and over 1,600 men will be massacred, including Dean's brother, Richard. Colin is the General that gives George and Dean their orders and there are several cameos, including Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch. The action scenes look great and realistic as George and Dean make their way across enemy territory, determined to succeed in their mission. It is a visceral look at war.

182,14 January 2020,joehislop,6, Great to look at but the plot holes!,"The effort Sam Mendes has gone to to create an authentic WW1 setting is astonishing. The scenes of the trenches, dead horses, bomb craters etc really put you in the scenes, and I was blown away by the film from a visual point of view. My problem is that the plot holes in the story were as big as some of the bomb craters. And after leaving, I realised they were too many and obvious to allow me to enjoy the film. (I'm about to reveal spoilers, so don't read on if you haven't seen it).
So we all know that it's true that German forces retreated from trenches at times. As the distance between allied and opposing forces was as matter of yards in many cases, the fact they had abandoned their line would have been obvious over a relatively short period of time to the allies, because of air and recon intelligence.
When the rat triggered the trip wire, both men were literally on top of the trap. It was a big enough explosion to collapse the entire tunnel, but they both survived without a scratch.
After the pilot killed Blake, almost straight away, Schofield was suddenly joined by a huge troop of British Allies. Where did they come from? Why didn't they just take the message?
When they drop Schofield off, he immediately starts getting sniped, while the troops are presumably right next to him. Why didn't they shoot back to help? Where did they disappear to?
When Schofield is being chased, he kicks a door through in clear view of his pursuer, and the pursuer just runs on. Leaving Schofield to spend a random night with a woman and baby who happened to be surviving on their own with no food and water, hidden in the same ruins as German troops.
There are more. I won't labour the point, but once you start seeing the flaws, they just all add up to make what is a beautiful film just too implausible for me.",

The film ""1917 (2019)"" of British director Sam Mendes, based on the stories of a family predecessor who had the misfortune to participate in World War I, is a clear example of the number of lives lost in a war, the pains that cause in the families of the fallen ones and the economic damages that it causes. This film reflects the damage with many details, one of them is the hatred among rival soldiers, to the point of assaulting when they are doing you a favor of life or death. Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay, both managed to attract all the attention of the public throughout the film and their performance was such that they looked like the same soldiers on the battlefield. They managed to bring reality to the big screen. There were no foolish scenes of those vulgar war movies that show non-existent supermen in those confrontations.

None of the encounters or events keep me intrigued, mainly because I didn't really care about the main character or if he succeeded.

197,5 February 2020,Lone_Mh,10, Perfect Non-stop narration of a world war story...,"How amazing it was from the first scene to the end( to me)! There're lots of world war movies out there and many are perfect though, but this one to me and for sure many others till now; was one of the best among all, this kind of non-stop narration that rarely the scenes seem to be changed like it doesn't change at all and the process goes through the end from only one view( I don't know if there's an specific word for this kind or not) makes it a perfect movie that forces you to sit back and follow the story and feel like you're the third person of the scene as a soul beside them and feel everything they do! Maybe others would say: ""oh! Come on, this is not all that!"" But it really is for me and the fans maybe. It could feel even better if more action scenes would come across, for sure.
So, Everything was good; it has some faults of course, in some scenes like when Blake was dying and was talking to Schofield and then two soldiers came through, and at the road, vehicles and soldiers were struggling with the trunk, I asked myself how fast it could happen and none of them could hear the voices, I mean that was really fast! It could take longer for all those vehicles to arrive there and spread over that land, so that they wouldn't seem to be acting obviously after the director allows them when the camera came through the road!!
But anyway, totally it's one of the best.

202,19 January 2020,Abranth-d,9, Roger Deakins is God,"Here's my review of 1917. So 1917 is directed by Sam Mendes , and I've been looking forward to this movie ever since the trailer dropped cause it's from the minds behind The war movie Jarhead which was also directed by Mendes and shot by frequent collaborator Roger Deakins. And I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I was blown away ! . The story is set amidst world war 1 and it's about these two soldiers who have to get through a lot of German territory and notify their camp to stop the planned attack for the next day. The journey to the camp is filmed to look like a one shot with no edits like how birdman was shot. And the man who shot it was Roger frickin Deakins , the man who shot the Shawshank Redemption , Blade runner 2049 and pretty much every movie which is worthy of being your desktop wallpaper , and this movie is no exception. The way it's shot makes you feel claustrophobic and also like you're watching a first person shooter game. The score by Thomas Newman was great and added a lot of weight to the story. The gripes I had with this movie was that you don't really care much for the characters cause you don't know much about them and since it's a warzone it's no surprise if anyone dies really, and the dialogue felt very bland in b/w convos , but I guess that's how people really talk at a time of crisis and quotable dialogue would've made it seem more fictional. In the end 1917 is more of an experience than a movie and to sum it up , it's the Revenant meets Dunkirk .",

I dont think its that great, its just a movie about a guy who wants to deliver a message to save 1600 of his fellow comrades. but after i watched this movie im proud to say that this movie is one of the best movies that i have ever seen in my whole life and its for sure on the list of my top 5 favorite movies.",

210,12 November 2021,mickman91-1,10, Probably the greatest film from the trenches of WW1,"It is quite surprising to learn that if you actually look at the numbers, there are not many films made about WW1 and certainly not the trenches, anymore. It is long enough ago now that all living grandparents and great grandparents who had experience of it, even if only as a child or through their parents, are no longer with us. So, unlike the 2nd World War which still more firmly feels part of the cultural and political fabric, WW1 is now a true 'historical' event. So when 1917 was released I was actually looking forward to it as I thought the time was right for another really good film from the trenches. And this certainly did not disappoint, in fact it was impressive on all accounts. The technical proficiency is absolutely amazing - it is largely single take which means that you live and breathe the few hours of one soldiers life with him without being able to take a break or switch perspective for a moment, just like the soldier. The pace also marches along rapidly, backed by an incredible score by James Newton Howard. The final 20 minutes are some of the greatest in cinema history. I truly felt like I lived and experienced the trenches like no other film, fiction or documentary, has allowed me before.

219,7 February 2021,hoernkeem,7," 1917 review (2019, Sam Mendes) War movie where gimmick excels over story","1917 (2019, Sam Mendes)
This is a tough film to rate, and I will probably fall victim to being overly critical on this movie. In a vacuum it is a very good movie. It is well shot and acted very well although it does have that British sensibility which can sometimes seem a bit austere to an American audience. It tells an emotional, meaningful story set in war torn Europe following two young soldiers who are trying to move quickly through enemy occupied territory in order to bring a message calling off an attack that is doomed to fail. To add to the gravitas one of the two soldiers has a brother in the unit set to attack. This gives extra urgency to the film. The two lance corporals are played by Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay. Chapman is most easily recognized as his role as Tommen in the hit show 'Game of Thrones'. It is actually funny because Richard Madden makes an appearance later in the movie and he is also a 'Game of Thrones' alum. Maybe it is just that so many superlative war films have been produced or maybe it is because this feels very derivative combining many elements from a lot of those other war films, but whatever the case this film just didn't connect with me. Both actors did admirable jobs in their roles. The whole thing felt off to me. I didn't feel shock or horror at the violent carnage portrayed on screen. I didn't get emotional when tragic occurrences happened. The whole deliver a message plot seemed a bit like a contrivance. I know this was based, in part, on stories that Mendes grandfather imparted, but in a world of epic war stories this just didn't feel very epic, but at the same time despite just focusing on these two men who were traveling I never got a sense of intimacy either. It is directed well although I found the faux single shot more gimmicky than providing any meaningful improvement to the picture. The cinematography from legendary Roger Deakins is a thing of beauty. I think it is easy to lump this film into the best films of the year simply because it checks a lot of those boxes that we think those films are supposed to have, but I have just seen this film too many times told in just as good if not better ways for '1917' to get too much praise from me.

221,7 February 2020,dhunjiwadia,10," Immersively done, sucks you into the horror of World War one","Immersively done, the movie sucks you into the horror of World War One. The camera tracks these 2 soldiers all the way through their mission with a smooth one shot for the entire length of the movie. According to the director Sam Mendes, it allows you to live with them and breathe every breath. And that feeling of never seeing further than the characters, always being trapped within their immediate environment, was an important reason why they decided to shoot this way. From the acting, to the cinematography, editing, score and overall direction Sam Mendes creates one of the best pieces of film ever to grace the silver screen. Congratulations in advance to 14 times Academy Awards nominee Roger Deakins for all the visual and technical brilliance - guaranteed Oscar for Best Cinematography. And for the critics who complain that there is no character building moment in the movie, it's because the motivation here is to save lives and not focus on characters. #1917 leaves you breathless, with an uplifting feeling (and some tears) when the journey comes to an end.

231,6 February 2020,amanmsp,10, A visually stunning and emotionally impactful masterpiece,"Despite being an year stacked with amazing movies, none of them managed to touch me as emotionally as this movie did. Directed magnificently by Sam Mendes, 1917 engrosses you and keeps you at the edge of your seats from the very beginning as the tense atmosphere and a constant sense of danger are maintained throughout the movie. The characters are not portrayed as invincible heroes but as regular young men who are trapped in this situation, fighting a pointless war. The character development for the two main leads was done subtly but very effectively, with limited exposition. The performances by George Mackay and Dean Charles Chapman were top-notch and makes us really empathize with their characters. The cinematography by Roger Deakins was nothing short of breathtaking. The one-shot technique makes the experience much more immersive as we feel as if we are present there along with the characters. The score by Thomas Newman was phenomenal and helped to elevate the impact of several scenes. Another noteworthy aspect of the movie was its incredible production design, particularly the battlefield and the abandoned town, which showcases some of the most impressive set constructions of the year. The sound design was outstanding and further helped to convey the intensity of the situation.",

I recently watched Saving Private Ryan, and I do believe that 1917 is superior. Some reviewers make it sound like 1917 is simply a technical triumph that is light on plot poignancy, but that diminishes the humanity that this movie represents.

The makeup is really good except for some reason the main characters look clean while everyone else looks like they were in a war. The story was really shallow and it felt like the distance these characters had to travel was not very far due to the one take shooting style. One take cinematography can work really well (Ex.

I deliberately didn't read any reviews in advance of the screening I saw, but by the end if it I was left feeling that this was a mediocre piece of filmmaking that could have been much better...the story was unconvincing (surely they'd have sent at least two teams with that message), ditto the acting and I wasn't wowed by the cinematography. Sometimes long shots are useful in showing scale, and WW1 was horrific in terms of the sheer numbers of men needlessly sent to their deaths. There just wasn't a sense of any of that....

But I hope my review is still useful for Sam Mendes loyal watchers. This movie had one long shot with one story only, but this is masterpiece. I would like directly say that Sam Mendes created story of a short journey of a English soldier, who represents the history of WW I itself. On the movie, you can see the trenches during World War I, the problem of being soldier, the ambiance of war, and the most important thing is that how from the beginning of the scene, the audiences can follow the journey of a soldier like they experience it by themselves. That soldier was supposed to give important message to other regiment, but on the journey there are many circumstances and events that he cannot deny. As an audience, I still remember all the scenes in one united story, and this is Sam Mendes expertise to make all scenes united in one single shot camera. Thank you also for camera crews that make this idea happen and perhaps become trend of scene language in the next 10 years in movie industry, especially war movies. This movie had lightened my day and although it receives some negative critics, I just do care about what is improvement for war movies. Sam Mendes had casting several figures that all have experiences in war movies and I think this wipes all the doubters. I mean, there are Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong, and Ralph Fiennes. Thank you for this movie, Sam Mendes!",

No movie in history has ever been filmed as if in one long, uncut scene! Genius and ground-breaking film making. Breathtaking cinematography. Grit and beauty and reality of war, through the lens of the Director's personal knowledge passed from his own grandfather. Tear-jerking, heart-wrenching, pulsating tension, individuals persevering through an ever changing and huge landscape of war and the unknown - this is an epic brilliantly made for the big screen experience - bold yet nuanced. There was no better film released in 2019, and the fact that overall IMDB rating is anything less than 10 can only speak on behalf of those persons rating this film who have not closely followed and watched films from the silents to today, evaluating story first and foremost, then in close conjunction with directing, acting, cinematography, sets and sound.

The suspension of disbelief required was, for me, unsustainable. For some reason the General with the vital information needed at one part of the front has brought it to another part of the front to find the only Lance Corporal in Kitchener's Army that can read a map, who happens to be the brother of a Lieutenant in the unit that needs saving. Two guys are sent on foot across miles of no man's land with a life-or-death message which could, perhaps, have been dropped from an aircraft, or sent by semaphore, or delivered by actual runners, or taken part-way in one of the many vehicles encountered on the roads going the same direction, or even delivered on one of the hundreds of thousands of horses in the British Army. The Germans have removed everything from their trenches, except a few cans of food and their valuable guns, which, for some reason were right at the front line and have been destroyed. Meanwhile an entire battalion or more is happily waiting around for over a day without communication with HQ, and about to attack the enemy lines without artillery support or confirmation that nothing has changed since the day before. A man falls into some white-water rapids in the middle of flat open farmland, which just happen to wash him up exactly where he needs to be, but he gets there a few minutes late, which was about the amount of time he decided to spend trying to teach a French/Belgian baby an English song, whereas a few hours before he was trying, single handed, to push a 5 tonne truck in the mud because every second counted.

First of all i love that the actors are 'real' i mean let's be realistic no one has the Rock as father, or Zac Effron at your school. The George Mackay is doing an AMAZING job. Like really full props to him, as wel as Dean-Charles. The movie is unique because it has just a few cuts in it. Like literally only three. You really get the pov but like as third person if that makes any sense. You get to see the realness of the character and really get a feeling of how things went down in WWI. And then we're not even talking about the music because oh my god, the music is outstanding. The violins really give you the full blown away feeling, maybe that's because i watched it in the cinema but i'm sure that with good headphones you'll get the same effect. Because the entire movie is almost one take you're really getting into the feelings of the character. You know just as much as the character. Nothing more nothing less. It was also a really good twist that Chapman died, i would've suspected that Scho would've died because he wasn't really in the spotlight at the beginning anyways.

280,9 May 2020,tomfeller,10, Two soldiers on a mission,"This film is dedicated to the grandfather of the film's director and co-author, Sam Mendes (nominated for Oscars in both the director and original screenplay categories). The grandfather was a messenger for the British army in World War I and told Mendes many stories about the war. The two main characters, Schofield (George MacKay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), are ordinary infantrymen, both lance corporals, who are given a mission by General Erinmore (Colin Firth) to deliver a message to Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) cancelling an attack that is doomed to failure. (The telephone lines are not operating.) They have to walk/run nine miles through contested terrain, and some of the individual scenes are quite horrific. The film set is over the days of April 6-7, 1917. The Germans have withdrawn to pre-prepared positions later known as the Hindenberg Line, and the British are pursuing them, not knowing that the Germans have prepared traps. One of the personal touches is that Blake's older brother (Richard Madden) is under Mackenzie's command.
The film's gimmick is that it was photographed in such a way that it appears to be just two continuous takes. The break occurs when one of the main characters is hit on the head during daylight, and it is dark when he wakes up. All the other cuts were cleverly disguised. Nonetheless, this puts the film in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock's Rope in which all the takes were exactly 12 minutes, a limitation caused by using traditional film, but the cuts were disguised to give the illusion that the action was continuous.

When the credits started instead of jumping up out of my seat, I had to collect my thoughts. The story telling, acting, visual continuous shooting totally absorb me. I sat and reflected on the insanity the 1st world war was to how good film making can get to your soul. Films of this outstanding quality are meant only for the big screen .",

All that I can say is that Sam Mendes's ""1917"" is a mind-blowing movie. Filmed as a single shot, it shows the horrors that the British troops witnessed during World War I. The combination of acting, cinematography and musical score create something unlike anything that you've ever seen (not least because of the sheer intensity of the battle scenes). We in the 21st century can never truly imagine the misery of fighting in WWI, but this movie at least gives us a feeling of it.",
287,11 January 2020,BA_Harrison,8, A technical triumph.,"It's over seventy years since Alfred Hitchcock made Rope, which tried to tell a thrilling tale of murder in a swanky New York apartment location with as few shots as possible, the director hiding any sneaky splices with clever visual trickery. For First World War adventure 1917, Sam Mendes pulls off the same illusion, only with the advantages of 21st century technology, meaning that his film is far more seamless and able to cover much more ground: the vast, body-strewn battlegrounds of northern France, to be precise, where Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) are given the unenviable task of delivering a letter to advancing British troops heading into a trap that could cost 1,600 lives.",

I adore this film. From opening frame to closing fade out, I think this is the work of a masterful voice in complete control of his technical gifts while using extreme intelligence in the use of images and telling an extremely affecting emotional story on top. This is a film I am going to be watching repeatedly over the coming years, and I think I'll be getting more out of it with every viewing.",

This is a masterclass in film production and an absolute blast from start to finish.",
290,4 February 2020,valadas,9, Epic and overwhelming,"And filmed as one shot which means that the action time is almost the same as the projection one. The story is simple but very exciting. In World Wat I it happened that two British soldiers in France are assigned by their general to deliver a message to the colonel commander of a battalion a few miles away who is planning an attack to German positions to profit from German army withdrawal. However this message urges the colonel to stop the attack since the supposed withdrawal of German forces is feigned and intends no more than attracting the British troops to a trap where 1,600 British would be killed. This message is needed because the phone lines had been cut by the Germans. The two men must cross a no man's land to get to the Colonel's battalion. During their journey they are fired at more than once by dispersed German soldiers and that is filmed and shown in admirable images and sequences using often great plans in every detail. The actor's performance is also great. One of the best movies of 2019.",

It reminds me slightly of Dunkirk in the way that both focus on the fear of being in war and how the soldiers within it deal with this rather than lots of explosions and gunshots.

In terms of scene scheduling, this is perfect and amazing. Switching different perspectives can move the viewer's sight. In a way, it completes the space Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk wants to explore. The plot is not particularly outstanding, so the technology must be excellent. I still like this movie.",

Of course, the real top war movies are essentially ""anti-war"" themes.

306,14 June 2022,nickenchuggets,9," ""If you fail, it'll be a massacre""","There are a great many movies that I hold off on watching until a few years after they are released, and this is one of them. I can't say exactly why I do this, but I think it has something to do with the absolutely obnoxious amount of hype certain films have around them. Some movies (including this one) were hyped up so much that everyone was expecting a masterpiece. Now that the hype has died down and I've decided to go see it, I can say that most of it was deserved, but some praise about this movie is misplaced. The movie is somewhat unique simply because it is set in World War 1, a conflict that is typically overshadowed by another war that came 2 decades later. People tend to dismiss movies about ww1 because the technology wasn't as advanced yet I suppose, but this war was way more brutal for the average soldier compared to ww2. I was wondering how they would portray all the horrors of the war when it came to this film, and the marvelous special effects really hammer home the authenticity. The special effects here are really something to behold, but I need to talk about the actual story first. The story in this focuses on two British soldiers, William and Tom (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman respectively), who are sent into hostile territory in order to try and cancel a foolhardy british attack that will leave over a thousand men dead. Both Tom and Will start off in a trench to receive a message from a General that is supposed to be shown to Colonel Mackenzie, commander of another british regiment. They then talk to a seemingly reckless and irritable Lieutenant who tells them there is a gap in some German barbed wire a few hundred feet from their current position. Upon venturing into the abandoned german trenches, they eventually come to an underground quarters with many beds, and a doorway that leads to a very long tunnel. As they're investigating this place, a lone rat sets off an explosive trap the germans left and the roof starts to collapse. Tom and Will manage to escape before they're nearly buried alive. Tom and Will next happen upon a desolate house which has a farm nearby, and even though nobody is in sight, you get the feeling something bad will happen. Sure enough, a german plane is destroyed in a dogfight with british planes, crashes nearby, and Will makes the mistake of rescuing the enemy pilot before his aircraft becomes a fiery grave. When Will disappears for a measly couple of seconds to give him something to drink, he turns around to see the pilot has fatally stabbed Tom. Will shoots the pilot and tries to get his friend to a field hospital, but he's so badly hurt he can't move. Before Tom dies, he tells his friend to find his brother, lieutenant Joseph Blake. Shortly after, Will, now alone, is on the move again. He hitches a ride on a lorry until it comes to a destroyed bridge. Not having the time to go around, Will crosses the remains of the bridge while under fire from a german sniper. After the sniper and Will shoot each other at the same time, the sniper is killed, but Will is left laying unconscious for several hours. Waking up and making his way to a destroyed French town, he tries to evade german patrols in the early hours of the morning, right when the sun is coming up. Outnumbered and being chased from multiple angles, Will ditches his rifle and decides to jump into a river. Upstream, he finally comes across D Company, who are some of the soldiers due to take part in the attack. Knowing he's running out of time, Will searches all over the trench network trying to find where Colonel Mackenzie could be, until he finds him all the way at the end of the trench in a small post. Will insists that he read the letter given to him by the general from earlier, but Mackenzie is convinced the germans are finally close to being overrun and is not about to stop his attack. Will tells him the germans have been waiting for this exact moment in order to trap the british, and the colonel tells his subordinate to call off the assault. Having saved many soldiers from certain death, Will has one more heroic act to perform. In the outdoor medical ward, where wounded from the battle are having grisly operations and amputations performed on them, Will comes across lieutenant Joseph Blake. He provides him with Tom's dog tag, meaning he didn't survive. Joseph is understandably sad, but appreciates all that Will has done to get this far, and allows him to write to their mother. With both his goals complete, Will heads away from the medical station and rests under a tree. While I feel most modern movies are usually too reliant on special effects, 1917 knows that they alone can't make a worthwhile viewing experience. The effects here aren't used as foundations of the story, instead they compliment it, and that's the way it should be. If you're watching this with headphones like I did, you'll likely be impressed by how good the sound design is. The gunshots and explosions have a lot of bass and tend to rock you around, which makes it feel like an actual battlefield. Even when many scenes in the movie don't take place in a battle, you feel it. I thought that the acting was convincing, with George and Dean-Charles accurately showing how horrible it must have been to be a soldier barely in his 20s fighting in the worst war humanity had ever seen up to that point. The landscapes and lighting in this movie are also really nice, since we often see huge expanses of fields and grasslands that emphasize how big of a conflict ww1 was. I shouldn't need to say this, but 1917 is one first world war movie that has really changed the way people view that war's carnage. They even show swarms of riflemen running to their deaths during the climax. Most movies made in britain don't really get a lot of attention here, so when I found out about 1917's existence, I knew it was going to be pretty important.",

His latest film is one big flex, proving how a war movie can be shot to appear as one continuous shot. His photography is stunning and basically makes this movie what it is. Sam Mendes provides reliably great direction and Thomas Newman's terrific score is pulse-pounding and urgent. The unknown lead actors are excellent, as are their more famous counterparts. The main flaw of the film is the lack of substantial character development or plot. 1917 is definitely more of a technical achievement than a full-fledged masterpiece as some are claiming.

I was going into this movie expecting something that rivals the likes of Saving PVT Ryan, Platoon, hell even We Were Soldiers, but 1917 didn't even come close to any of these movies mentioned. This movie tells a simple story, which you pretty much have figured out about 15 minutes going in, not a lot of suspense or drama in the whole movie.

335,23 March 2020,mnogogaloshi,10, A masterpiece,"1917 is a perfect film. It's not only captivating, moving and thrilling but it's also one of the best crafted movies ever made. My favorite things about it is how easy it is to remember all of its scenes in a chronological order. Every single scene is an element and a tool for the progression of the story. It doesn't matter if it's a crossing of a battlefield, pushing a cart or having a one on one shootouts with the enemy, it's all beautifully done and an example of how continuity should be executed. My favorite scene is the one in which we see the soldiers sitting in a big circle and listening to the Wayfarig Stranger. In this scene, one of the most touching I've ever seen our hero finally reaches the soldiers he's trying to find, but he finds that out only after the end of the song, because it's so electric that nobody really notices his presence there. The death of one of the main characters also serves as an example of a wonderfully crafted picture, because it's as sudden and realistic as none of us expect to see. Another interesting feature is the pain that the characters go through. Its constantly present on screen with characters putting their bleeding hands in a rotting corpse, being blown up, shot, beaten and chocked to death. One of my favorite things about the film is the fact that it never addresses the physical pain and the injuries that William Schofield constantly sustains. Every once in a while he sits down for a moment, touches the back of his head, which is bleeding of course and at the next moment he is back on the road. The fantastic Oscar worthy cinematography, direction and effects add the finishng touches to this timeless masterpiece.",

338,15 January 2020,ChristyLeskovar,9, Outstanding,"Quite a movie-a simple story masterfully done that told a much larger story, and that was the tragic futility of the First World War. It is art rather than entertainment or history. Having done exhaustive research on the war for One Night in a Bad Inn, many visual details were familiar. I don't remember being so affected by a movie since the Passion of the Christ. I think seeing it on the big screen amplified the intensity. We saw it in XD. I also can't recall a movie in which the music was this effective in amplifying the drama; the music sweeps you into the scene. I found it remarkable that the leads were played by unknown actors while three A list actors played cameo roles. Though the director's grandfather was in the war and one of his stories was the inspiration for movie, the story line was fictional as were the characters. Telling the details of history was not the point of the film. Telling the broad truth of a war that was one the greatest tragedies in history was.
I suggest sitting toward the back of the theater. The dialogue included R rated language that I can always do without. If you are familiar with the First World War, put all that out of your head. I was distracted thinking where are they, which battle, . . .? That's not the point. Just watch it. Having seen only one other best picture nominee, this definitely deserved to win.",

The story switches seamlessly from loud, intense, and anxiety inducing, to quiet, reflective, and almost tender at times. 1917 is to WWI what Saving Private Ryan was to WWII, and is one of the best movies ever made. I can't lie, with the majority of movies and shows nowadays being absolute trash, like the new marvel movies, or shows like Batwoman, it is movies like this that still give me hope, that there will always still be some directors and writers that actually care about telling a story, without feminism or sjw nonsense to get in the way.

Get the message to the front before something bad happens. It so happens, the brother of one of the travelers is at the front lines about to face certain death.
While that is an engaging premise, the execution is...well, let's just say there is a reason why there is editing in movies. It's a slog because the travel time is essentially at real time.
Though I will give credit where credit is due, how do you make that remotely interesting. Well, predictably, it's to include townspeople. In the French, a couple of faceless enemy soldiers and running into other soldiers. It couldn't just be a walk. Great. Unfortunately, you start to feel the slowness of the flick. The concept is great, but we missed out on the true ugliness of war, BECAUSE, it most likely is THAT boring. So you see the exercise in it.
Granted...director Sam Mendes does something really great, which is not glorify war. You see a LOT of aftermath.
However, too many dumb things in this movie that anchor it down. The dead run through mortar and gunfire at the end is pure..um...""Dances With Wolves"" or the fact that the Germans couldn't shoot straight to save their lives. Too many questions bog this down. Was there a better solution here? Probably not. This is THE best a WW1 movie could be. I guess. ""Paths of Glory"" is probably better.
All in all, it's not a movie recommended on a streaming platform. It is a theater movie, so go see it there.

Secondly, the atmosphere of war is shown great, you see a lot injuries, blood, dirt and pain. Thirdly, the cast did the amazing performance, two main characters perfored real friendship in war.

You get a journey out of the 90 min plus run time, and you're in it for every second. The one take makes you feel like you're on this journey with these soldiers. When they get shot at you feel like you got shot at, when they crawl in the mud you feel like you're in the mud etc. The performance by the leading man is great and I hope to see him in future films or tv.

While those with short attention spans may think it's boring because theirs not constant blood or witty banter all the time, but don't let that subtract anything from the film.

382,10 January 2020,trev-268-155698,10," Devastating, immersive and a technical marvel","It took a minute or two for me to regain composure as this iMax experience rolled it's credits. Devastated would probably describe my state as I returned to the real world.
I wasn't sure how the first person (apparent) single shot structure of this movie would work out for me. I did enjoy, if that's the word, Dunkirk and the intimate view of the setting and characters. Immersive is the word of the decade and it can prove tiresome.
As the opening sets us on a journey, I was aware this was going to be a technical marvel. This is the frustration of being a cameraman. I literally hold my breath when an impossible move or a focus pull is executed. I know the pressure of having to get it right first time, but on these budgets it's ramped up to 110%.
I'm not averse to these techniques, Cloverfield and even the Blair Witch made it work really well. In this case I thought it was so beautifully executed, that after ten minutes, I had pretty much forgotten it and was totally drawn in.
Much of the credit must obviously go to the DOP, Roger Deakins and a team of grips that pulled this off so flawlessly, however the lead actors literally suffered through every step of the way and I take my hat off to them all.
George MacKay has been an actor I have watched grow through a variety of films over the last few years and I think he is destined for a long career. His deeply moving, but perfectly understated performance was the main cause of my emotional connection with the whole movie. He is in every single moment and you feel the brutality and exhaustion for the duration.
Incredibly, Mr.Deakins manages to create a series of beautiful frames, even though he is physically miles away from the camera for most of the time and the majority of the film is using available light. One particular series of shots is a masterclass in dynamic lighting and becomes a work of classical imagery evoking Turner.
For all these reasons I would advise this to be seen in an iMax if possible to achieve the maximum effect, it also proves that we really don't need 3D?
How the leaders of the World's nations even consider conflict after the last two catastrophic wars I will never understand. I can only assume they are too consumed with hatred for humanity to spare the time to watch a film like this and learn.",

Someone that would've charged out of a trench or a foxhole without hesitation to take down the enemy. Someone that would instantly lay down his life so others could live on. This film really makes me think twice about what I would've done in those horrid times. As this is the finest example of a military related film I have seen in the last 22 years, you feel like you are there along side those unfortunate souls standing in the trenches. Its terrifying. There were 4 moments in particular where I found myself not being able to take a breath, frozen in fear of what was going to happen next. This is all thanks to the GOAT himself, Roger Deakins. If he doesn't pick up his second academy award this year i'm going to petition it as a crime against humanity. This movie is complex on so many other levels though. The set design is astounding. Another oscar i'm sure this film will pick up. Directing was top notch (I admit i had my doubts about Sam Mendes because of Spectre but he has completely redeemed himself on every level) and I can see Medes picking up his first oscar this year. If you're a person that loves military films like myself, you'll love this movie. If you're a person that hates military films, you'll still love this movie. It definitely leans more to the side of anti-war, as I don't think anyone can say the events that transpired during the 19-teens had any bit of positivity after viewing this film. Death and destruction is what you'll see unfold before you instead of bonds being made between men like most war films showcase. I can't wait to go see this film again.

--spoilers sort of--
It is a true eye opener. I have never imagined anything like this in my 40 year life while watching a war movie. 1917 shows that the real horror of it was not the body parts, imminent death or the terror . They are very real and horrible of course but no other film managed to shook me with the meaninglessness of the whole concept of war and the madness of nations to put all that effort (digging that trenches !!) to efficiently exterminate each other's most precious assets, meaning their children, to the point that it is their own children and their own future that they waste abundantly at the end. They tell in the movies people go to war to protect loved ones but it is a lie. The loved ones were dying horrible deaths in this movie .
I see now that the heroes exist but they should not need to be and the lives that might have saved by their heroic acts were maybe lost the next day anyway. No other film to my knowledge plainly put it this way before .
It made me cry to think that we repeated the whole thing again in WW2 and to a lesser extent in all conflicts and smaller scale wars in the world since then. When will we ever learn?",

The visual effect is quite mediocre to me, compared to those war blockbusters such as Saving Private Ryan (1998) and Fury (2014).

401,25 January 2020,zardoz-13,10, One of the Most Memorable World War I Movies,"Two young British Infantry corporals receive orders from their Company Commander in director Sam Mendes' gripping, often surreal World War I movie ""1917"" to deliver an urgent message to rescind a planned frontal attack on enemy positions on the Western Front. These two, clean-cut, lads embark on a genuine journey of hardship that nobody expects them to carry out and brave an obstacle course teeming with ravenous rats, lethal German snipers, while their own men try to sidetrack them. The action takes place in trenches, trucks, rivers, forests, and the remains of bombed out villages. Furthermore, they have only so much time to accomplish their mission, and the odds are stacked against them from the start. Heroism has rarely been portrayed in such realistic terms. Moreover, these two boys aren't trigger-happy, bloodthirsty killers, but naïve souls who don't have a clue what they have volunteered for once they forge ahead. The tragic catch is that only one of them will survive this nightmare. The one who dies doesn't die shooting it out with German soldiers. Instead, he will die trying to help a downed German aviator escape from his crashed biplane before its flaming fuselage incinerates him. ""1917"" captures the horror of the War to End All Wars as it was called by the politicians. Although ""Apocalypse Now"" dealt with the Vietnam War, the two movies reflect the futility of war as well as the humanity of their young men who bore arms in the conflict. What these two fellows experience is unforgettable, but it doesn't depict gung-ho heroics. Instead, men scramble to stay alive and often behave like cowards. Everywhere these two Brits go, they see the many faces of death. Rivers are choked with bloating, ashen-faced corpses, but director Sam Mendes resists the urge to show soldiers getting blown to smithereens or tangled up in their own guts like Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan.""
When a British sergeant orders Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman of ""The King"") to pick somebody to accompany him to headquarters, he doesn't think twice about taking his friend Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay of ""Defiance"") with him. Schofield isn't especially enthusiastic about the prospect that awaits them, but he tags along with Blake to the C.O.'s tent. General Erinmore (Colin Firth of ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"") shows them several maps of the Western Front as well as aerial photographs and explains that the Germans have abandoned their trenches. Initially, the High Command thought this represented a triumph. Instead, Erinmore explains the Germans not only deliberately left the battlefield, but also these sly Huns are orchestrating a Trojan Horse trap. When the British launch their next attack, they will be unwittingly feeding their troops into a German meat grinder. As it turns out, Corporal Blake has been chosen not only for his map reading skills, but also because his brother, Lieutenant Joseph Blake (Richard Madden of ""Rocketman""), will die in the attack if it isn't halted. Corporal Blake has more incentive that anybody else under Erinmore's command, and the General calculates that this will enable him to complete the mission.
""1917"" is a sprawling, epic saga, and we're drawn into their plight, because we're following them every bloody step of the way. ""Skyfall"" director Sam Mendes and ""Brazil"" lenser Roger Deakins present this incredible mission as it unfolds on April 6, 1917. The film has a documentary feel to it, especially when our protagonists shoulder their way through fellow troops lining the infinite labyrinth of trenches. Each face tells a terrible story, and the officers hold out little hope for survival. Initially, during the first twenty minutes, Blake and Schofield are stunned by the uncanny silence that hangs ominously over the abandoned enemy trenches. Rats the size of racoons scavenge among the kitbags of food left behind by the Germans. Our two lads gaze in stupefaction at dozens of artillery pieces which the Huns have spiked in their urgency to retreat. At one point, the Brits enter a tunnel that appears to serve as a shortcut through this eerie no-man's land. One huge rat dragging a bag of food catches on a tripwire, and an explosion buries Schofield, and Blake digs him frantically out of the rubble. These guys were prepared to fight the Germans, but they had no idea a hungry rodent could pose such danger. Everywhere they go, no matter how desolate it appears, our protagonists discover nothing is what it seems. Death lurks everywhere, especially where they least expect it.
About forty-five minutes into ""1917,"" after one of the two protagonists has been killed, the other realizes his life literally hangs by a thread. He catches a ride in a truck with other British soldiers, but they are heading in the wrong direction, so he must leave them where a collapsed bridge marks their point of departure. No sooner has he parted company with them than a German sniper starts blasting away at him. Scenes like this spawn white-knuckled tension, and both combatants never really see each other until our hero silences the sniper. When our protagonists embarked on their mission, they were loaded down like pack mules with ordinance and rations. By the time the surviving Brit spots the men he is supposed to save, he has only his uniform to prove he is British. Incredibly, he learns to his chagrin a glory hound of an officer may ignore his message that he has literally died for to deliver. Earlier, when he lost most of what he was lugging along with him, our lone soldier dived into a river to elude enemy fire. Swept downstream, he winds up caught up in a logjam of rotting, bloated corpses that prevent further progress. A night in a bombed-out village has a hallucinatory quality as flares burst repeatedly above the buildings, and their skeletal remains ripple with spooky shadows. By the time our hero attains his objective, you'll feel as traumatized by this spectacle as he is",

408,16 January 2020,jarenlyman,10, I dare to say it's a masterpiece,"I've seen a decent amount of war movies in my life, and while I've always had an appreciation for such films as ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""Schindler's List"", I've never been a war movie fanatic. Even though I have praise to give them, I tend to not revisit them too often. This film however, I can say that I can see myself revisiting at least a few more times, and more than likely while it's still in theaters. It's a marvel of an achievement in the cinematography department, and the production behind it is anything but lazy. The acting is superb, and believable in every scene. The lighting is very effective in a few key scenes that are standing out fresh in my mind. The movie also knows just when to have a lack of a score to build tension, and when to bring in the epic orchestra to ramp up the drama of the scene. The make up is top notch, and the wardrobe is indistinguishable from authentic uniforms of the time. The story, though simple, is very engaging, and does an outstanding job of plopping you right in the middle of it. For it being the ""one shot"" gimmick throughout the film, I never once felt that the pacing suffered from it, and it only added to the experience, and the immersion. Most movies I see, even the ones I adore, tend to have very small things here and there that I can find to nitpick if I really want to, but this film, I can't think of one thing I would change. Not one thing comes to mind that could've improved this experience for me. See this movie on the big screen if you can. I urge you to not let this movie fly under the radar. See it, tell people you know to see it. Help ensure that the very hard work that was put into this pays off for all of those involved! I cannot recommend it enough!",

I Was enthrealled from the very minute and never got out of the plot, which ends as it began, drawing a beautiful loop. During the mission I Had the feeling that it wasme who was corrying it out. The cameraman's close-ups are impressive during the film. In ""1917"", everything is mastered is such abrilliant was that it is difficult to get out of the film. But what really amazed me was the supporting roles, who are not only there to say 2 or 3 lines. 1917 lasts one hour and fifty minutes sharp and yes thatis important. Becuase the action is supposed to we taking place live time, which allows a total incursion into the plot. I felt like I was on earch adventure with the gun in my hand and not the soldiers'

From the beginning I loved the directing and camera work from the film, obviously Sam Mendez did a great job and I could tell from the first 5 minutes of the movie. The movie was shot without a transition or a cut scene between lines and characters, and it was shot without the use of a walking cameraman. The ability of being able to direct in this way and to focus zooming in or out on a character and viewing the troubles of WWI without a cut scene watching the two main characters walk through the trenches or travel through no mans land gives the audience a view of what WWI was like and they did a great job of representing it. Not that I know about WWI, but because they directed the movie in that way, it gives a great representation of the battles and struggles of war and the hardships that our main characters went through. Directing, Writing, Camerawork were all incredible in this film, that's what made it so special, but I still feel that there is something missing from it, something that I wish they included a bit more character growth and connection with the audience. However, it is still a great film and revolutionizing for film making.",

But the most important thing remains the direct and indiscriminate directing of the method of filming that would otherwise have been an ordinary film in my view It suffices to name the director Sam Mendes.

424,19 January 2020,mel_bear,8, One of the greatest visually breathtaking movies to hit our screens in years.,"A side note: I turned up at the local cineplex and the ticket person checked my ticket and pointed out the correct cinema showing 1917. I didn't think I had arrived late but it seemed to have already started. The scene was the trip by the vehicles through the mud and fallen trees. I picked up the story no problem. My impressions at this point of the movie was the extremely inappropriate music that sounded more in keeping with a Star Wars film than something set in World War I. I had similar issues with the movie 'Dunkirk'. Anyhow after 40 minutes the movie finished and I knew something was wrong. I checked back with (another) ticket collector and found that my session wouldn't be starting for 20 minutes. So I managed to see 1917 twice. At least some of it twice.
Seeing the beginning made me rethink a few of the issues I had initially felt. Yes the music was still inappropriate and as the volume and tension slowly increased we all knew that something was going to happen. Worse was that the music was continuous through, I guess, 90% of the movie. Why don't directors just leave everything to the sound effects department?
I also found that the slight overuse of profanity and gestures a bit out of period. Am open to correction here.
To the movie. When I first viewed it I was not conscious of the 'one shot' camera work until the final conflict. Seeing it from the beginning impressed me so much. The camera work and art direction deserve awards and what is sometimes overlooked is the extras casting. Absolutely brilliant.
The two leads had to hold the whole film together and they did that and more.
Ok, I have issues, but over all, if someone asked me what I thought, I would have to tell them that this was probably one of the most visually exciting movies of the past ten years.",

As far as winning in the the Oscar for best cinematography, this film sould walk away with it hands down. The casting and acting was definitely top notch as well.
The only thing that made me twinge just a bit was the character of Blake, (played superbly by Dean-Charles Chapman). I found his character, while noble and brave, to be extremely naive. From his almost over zealous additude towards going into enemy territory, to his foolish empathy towards the enemy which eventually cost him his life- in the most careless way possible. The character seemed unfinished, perhaps a bit too young, which is probably what the writers intended.

Think ""Saving Private Ryan"" with robot like, forgettable soldiers, accompanied by very loud soaring music to alert you of the upcoming shooting scene.

I really didn't care about the protagonist/s much because there was very little character development and a lot of potential opportunities were lost when they killed off Lance Corporal Blake. The movie was just basically about one man's survival from one scene to the next and the filmmakers weren't adept enough to create sympathy for the lone surviving protagonist in my opinion. It's difficult to develop a character that way but it can be done as with films like the Revenant, Castaway and Naked Prey. 1917 felt more like an excuse to show off cinematography and create set pieces rather than tell an interesting story. I'm giving this film a C+/B- because there were some good scenes and a lot of impressive work went into the historic recreation of battlefields",

I am a wife and a Mother and admittedly I can be a little emotional but I don't easily cry at movies. This. Movie. Well, it was truly brilliant and not just because of the way the story was told or the INSANE set design but somehow the director made you feel like you were right there with the characters walking timidly behind each one of their brave steps. This movie didn't glorify war or the good guys or even country this movie glorified the nobody specials who were the greatest hero's we'll ever know. It reminded us of the sacredness of each and every life, of family of friendship and the strength of the human spirit. I've never seen anything like it and probably will never again. I'm sorry but there needs to be something higher than the Oscar for this movie. My sincerest of thank you's to the actors who played the roles in this movie and the respect they gave each character.

I was not expecting this. I was hooked from the start and felt like I was in the movie experiencing the journey myself. I have never been so attached from reality while watching a movie. Or should i even use that phrase because what this movie showed was actual reality once. Let's say this movie attached me from the reality of our modern time of peace and just for few hours brought my mind to the reality of war over 100 years ago. This is a movie for all humans with human emotions.
I got watery eyed multiple times during the movie. I have got watery eyed during some emotional movies before and I thought that was the level of emotion this movie could bring me and keep at. Not the case. I was shown a whole new level of emotional movie experiences. This movie experience was going to be like nothing else before. It felt like I was building tension inside my body from holding back emotions during the movie. After the movie finished I was in shock. I could only stare at the credits without moving a limb except clenching my fists to hold back tears because I didn't want to start crying in the movie theater. I could feel my heart rate go up and breathing getting shallower and faster. I was even shaking a bit. This was a real moment for me. There was only one couple of people left in their seats clearly emotional too when we finally slowly left the theater after I got back my ability to move. I couldn't say much to my fiancé while we were walking home. She was concerned because I was so quiet and asked me how I was feeling and I only could tell her that I just wanted to go home so I could cry. We got home, I let all the built up emotions out and cried my eyes out to my fiancés scarf while hugging her making her cry too. It felt like my soul was washed when I let the emotions loose with the tears flowing out. It was a relief. I felt pure. This was very unique and personal experience. It's amazing how art can have such an effect on human emotions. I had never been made feel likes this before by a piece of art. Now I have. I am grateful.",

472,12 January 2020,j-madej,10," It's the way the story is told, that truly permits the audience to immerse themselves in this WWI epic.","My review of ""1917"".
There are very few movies which successfully pull off illusion of being shot in one continues take.
Alfred Hitchcock's 'ROPE' (1948) comes to mind, as well as the opening shot of Orson Wellse's 'Touch of Evil' (1958). More recently ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" (2014) directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu earned the best Picture and best Director among other categories back in 2015, which shows how much the Academy appreciates this stylistic yet technically difficult choice of story exposition.
By now everyone knows that Sam Mendes's ""1917"" has yearned the Golden Globe for best film and before seeing it I was bit unsure of this choice leaning towards 'JOKER' as the best movie of the year. Potentially Mende's movie has all the ingredients to be special. First, an acclaimed director in Sam Mendes, second arguably the best director of photography who paints with light in Roger Deakins, the budget of close to 100mil, so what could go wrong? Well perhaps setting a challenge of trying to convey movies full story in real time using what appears to be one continues take.
Magician does not explains how he achieved particular trick same as filmmaker usually doesn't show how he created film sequence. By doing so, he is demystifying the process which should only be known to the initiated. However there are widely available online behind the scenes footage, where both director as well as DP explain the challenges of creating whole movie using continues tracking shoot, which follows two protagonists who are Lance Corporal Blake played by Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay playing Lance Corpal Schofied. Both young army man during the First World War are given an impossible mission to deliver a message deep in enemy territory that will stop 1,600 men, and one of the soldiers' brothers, from walking straight into a deadly trap. As the story unfolds we are following them through the trenches and obstacles trying to fiulfil their mission.
At first when I though that this movie will be shown in real time using continues take with edits hidden in wipes (movement of the camera which lingers on wall or other objects permitting seamlessly to connect two scenes together in editing making it look as one continues take) I was unsure. When I first heard that ""1917"" employed this technique I feared that it might be used as gimmick, however when I find out that Roger Deakens is involved in the project I knew Sam Medes's picture was in good hands. Most people will not understand how much work it takes to create movie this way. The control of focus and the light alone is a very difficult task. However if one take tracking shot technique isn't used for the narrative purpose, then whole film potentially could fail. That's where Sam Mendes directing comes in to play, who also co-wrote the screenplay which he based on a very personal story of his grandfather's experiences in WWI titled""The Autobiography of Alfred H. Mendes 1897-1991"".
Sam Mendes is a special director, we could point to many movies which prove this argument. From ""American Beauty"" to my favourite Bond to date in ""Skyfall"". He is a director who is able to convey emotion, without being overly dramatic. There is a subtleness within which he is able to covey inner emotions of the character by using not only actors performance, but utilising blocking (movement of actors in relation to camera) in a landscape scope of the composition. Film of this sort only works if the audience truly feels like they are on a journey together with our protagonists and big credit for doing so needs to be given to musical score which is used to convey danger, emotionality and melancholy when needed.
The reason why this film works is because all of the above mentioned techniques are utilised to tell the story and forward the narration to an emotional impact on the viewer. Yes, the performances are strong, with cameos from Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and charismatic as always Mark Strong, not to mention both leads, but it's the way the story is told, that truly permits the audience to immerse themselves in this WWI epic. After watching ""1917"" I can honestly say, I strongly believe this picture will receive an OSCAR's for the best film and cinematography (in any other year I would pick the ""JOKER"" for the best film and cinematography, but this year Roger Deakens should not be denied) and possibly Sam Mendes for having an overview over all these elements, to create arguably best movie of the year, which up to that point this distinction belong in my humble opinion to the ""JOKER"". I strongly feel Sam Mendes has made his grandfather very proud, in his attempt to bring all the creative pieces together, creating in it's entirety a masterpiece of a movie, which film students will study for years to come.",

The whole film I was shaking with goosebumps one minute then completely sobbing the next and then chuckling at some of the one-liners in the next scene. That being said, this film is building and you can feel it and that climax is so emotionally breathtaking and intense.The performances are outstanding and the cinematography is just incredible. What really ties this film together is Thomas Newman's score that is beautiful yet intense mirroring exactly what the film is. 1917 better win Best Picture and Best Director at least at the oscars and that is saying something in a year like this where there has been so many groundbreaking films and performances. 1917 is my new favourite film.",

481,19 March 2020,ironhorse_iv,9, I can't stay quiet on the western front. This war movie needs to be heard. 1917 is an intense powerful film.,"This 2019 motion picture tells the harrowing story of two British World War 1 Tommies soldiers William Schofield (George MacKay) & Thomas Blake (Dean Charles Chapman) who are ordered to deliver a message about a German ambush before it's too late. Without spoiling the movie too much, composer Thomas Newman's music is jaw dropping haunting yet beautiful to listen to. 'The Night Window', 'Gehenna' and 'Sixteen Hundred Men' are some of the best tracks I ever heard in a war movie. Along with that, the visuals by cinematographer Roger Deakins with his crew are epic. They really did capture the perspective of what a soldier from the first world war will go through with the visuals. Everything about the camera work was near perfect. To add onto that the film was so meticulous edited that it really did look like the entire film was shot with one continuous real time seamless take. It's hard to spot where the cuts are. While some people might think that this way of shooting is highly distracting and gimmicky. The long take sequence wasn't too much of a turn off for me. I think that way of filming works within the story as it shows how vast the scale the dangerous journey is and how much time it takes to get place to place in order to save lives. However, the contrived coincidence moments involving the milk and the truck transfer just appearance out of nowhere was kinda jarring. Plus, I would had like to see the film done without the whole black out intermission flash forward sequence. That took me out of the story a bit as I was reminded that I was watching a film rather than real time occurrence but that's nitpicking. If anything, most of sophisticated camera movement was surprisingly smooth for a war movie. Glad to see that they went the spiritualism third person viewpoint rather than the first-person shaking cam look with their plan sequence. You really get to see all the details such as the vast number of extras with historical well-made accurate costume & make up work trapped in a claustrophobia sandbag trench surround by muddled empty field of craters full of corpses, barb wire, and shell cases. Then there is the wore down farm house including the burn out ruins of the urban settling that reminds the audience that the battles of WW1 weren't always fought in nowhere trenches, but also around people's homes. Surprisingly for a war movie, there was a very limited amount of action scenes here. Instead most of the film has the characters move from one upsetting site to other to build fear and suspense. For the most part, it kinda works. I would rather have that rather than a poorly done large CGI battle. The fake looking special feature failure of Schofield jumping off a cliff into a river to escape the Germans was enough to prove that direction would not work. Instead just seeing them scout around was very intense as invisible enemies are always hinted to be nearby. The acting from these two along with the supporting cameos of several seasonal performers like Colin Firth, Mark Strong & Benedict Cumberbatch was top notch. You really do see the anxiety and heart break spill out within their faces. The movie could has work with just the two main characters being silent and letting the body language speak for itself. However, I do get that it might cause the characters to seem more fictional shallow one-dimensional everymen that the audience can put themselves into rather than realistic living breathing human beings. Nevertheless, I felt that most of the dialogue between them could had been more detail. I really didn't get a grasp of who these characters really were. Regardless I did like the small semi conflict between the two over patriotism and just wanting to survive the war. After all, WW1 by contrast was a global conflagration in which nationalism was the spark. While other war movies might pick a patriotic or antiwar side. This movie was just more focus about the goal of enough saving individuals as possible rather than making a political statement for or against war. There is no better example of that than the beautiful reading of Edward Lear 'the Jumblies' poet sequence & the haunting singing of 'I am a Poor Wayfaring Stranger' later on the film. The character at first feels like he is just a wander in a deadly nonsensical world. Until he finds purpose by seeing unsung heroic done by his comrade for the immediate love of the family unit. That's deep character development. We also see this with the symbolism of the white cherry trees throughout the film. They are use to represent both death and life. For example, the cutting of the trees are the first signs of the salt the earth strategy employed in the war, yet the film points out that in the long run it will result in even more cherry trees growing in the area. The movie even opens and closes in a tree of life settling. It's very powerful metaphor. Fortunately, contrary to many other works about World War I, the film makes no attempt to show sympathy with enemy soldiers. Germans troops in the film are portrayal as uncivilized brute killers when in truth, most of them hold the same moral valor and honor as the allies. While the movie does take others artistic liberties such as the mixer of British units when most of them were regionally recruited and weapons like Mark II tank yet to made. For the most part, the film is historical accurate despite most of it was loosely based on various real-life accounts that director and cowriter Sam Mendes's grandfather told him in his youth. Although the screenplay by Krysty Wilson Cairns might be fictional set in a real historical backdrop; '1917' is one film worth fighting in the trenches for. Highly recommended.",

It seems like all these world war movie have that same cinematic tone. Feels like they just started to invent color in 1917. It's a cool feeling that makes them all match up and I note it makes it easier to conceal certain effects.

489,12 January 2020,Benslie,10, A perfect war film that will become a classic,"I know that everybody who has seen and reviewed this movie has mentioned this one aspect of the movie but it's the best thing in this movie and that's the way it was filmed and edited to look like a long one-shot. While I was watching this movie, I was playing a fun game in my head of find where they matched the scene up and some parts it was obvious where they ended one scene and matched it to start the next but there were a lot of ones I couldn't figure out where they stopped filming and matched it up for a new scene. This just goes to show how great the editors on this movie were and when it comes time for the Oscars, they get a nomination for best editing. Despite this movie being a war movie there isn't a whole lot of action happening, sure there are a couple of scenes of action but it's not reliant on action, this movie is not boring in the slightest. There is so much to look at and admire about this movie like the cinematography and set design. Just like with editing I hope this movie gets a nomination for best cinematography because there were some outstanding shots that encompass the lighting. I wish I could go further into this but sadly I can't and you just need to see the movie for yourself to understand why. The set design helped bring the audience members into the movie with how accurate the sets looked. When they were in a trench you felt like you were in there with them and when they were out in the open you felt scared for them. In other words, you felt like a fly in the air following them on this journey. In the end, 1917 is just a spectacular war movie and is perfect for people who both love and or hate war movies, this is coming from someone who isn't the biggest fan of them. I have a good feeling this movie will become a classic war film.",

The two lance corporals went through rotting dead bodies and rats feeding on them and ended up by a dilapidated abandoned house. The brits downed a german plane and the plane crushed right next to the house and they escaped by the skin of their teeth. Blake wanted to help the injured german pilot and got stabbed by him. It was a lethal wound and he passed away there and a British convoy found the other. He joined them and travelled at the back of a truck until they reached a collapsed bridge. From there on he had to walk as he was racing against time. A soldier was trying to shoot him from a window of the house by the river as he was crossing the river on the railing of the collapsed bridge. He managed to kill him but passed out too as he was injured too. He woke up and continued on walking through the ruins of some buildings. It was rather heart-breaking when he found a young woman and a baby girl hiding in a basement. He gave them all his food and had to kill a german because and had to jump into the turbulent river while trying to run away from the other. He got almost drowned but managed to get out of the water in the forest and find the soldiers of the second battalion. I expected here a more impressive ending but he just walked thru the trench until he found the commander and gave him the letter. He then found the brother of Blake and told him about what had happened. Blake's brother was the worst actor in the movie. Then he sat down leaning against a tree and looked at the picture of his beloved ones. The ending was a bit too anticlimactic as I expected the commander to not comply with the orders and even more but everything went a bit too smooth. All in all I enjoyed it especially the two lance corporals and their acting skills as they are spot-on casts.,

Basically after 30 minutes the story is filled with inconsistencies. One scene after the other I asked myself what added value it had. A raging river in that part of France? All mamals are dead except the rats and 1 cow next to a farm which has a bucket full of milk sitting next to it. No humans in sight except dead cows. Then suddenly a regiment of Tommies show up. They are urinating against the farm. They drive merrily around in trucks behind ennemy lines while the two main characters had to make their way through barbed wire, mud, corpses of horses and humans, booby traps, crows feasting on bodies etc. Our hero gets shot in the front of his body but when he wakes up he has a wound in the back of his head.

Sam Mendes directs this exceptionally and the cinematography is stunning. Totally worth the watch",
512,15 January 2020,Elcid_Asaei,1, Watch 'Paths of Glory' instead!,"What happened to the Sam Mendes, from works of substance like 'American Beauty' and 'Road to Perdition' to somewhat juvenile, empty of soul films like '1917', where deep characters and real emotions are subverted for theme rides. Here, of all subjects to use for a theme ride, ""the Great War"" is a vehicle for an action adventure, fantasy-esque quest, that not only sheds little about the horrific war itself, but sanitises the sacrifice of young men by a corrupt elite on both sides of the war, who profited heavily from their demise. But you might say, ""Elcid, this is a popcorn action flick, you got to switch off your brain mate, enjoy the ride..."", yet even for mindless action, I never felt at the edge of my seat, and all of the meant-to-be tense and gripping scenes felt forced and contrived, and you could see the actors reacting to cues rather then immersed into Sam's world of make believe. There are two truly great scenes in 'Children of Men' (Alfonso Cuarón), both near the beginning and near the end, where the action takes place in one shot, and here the veracity of both the characters and their environment is so powerful that you truly feel immersed and haunted by the scenes. In interviews, Mendes says he was inspired by these scenes, but it seems by trying to emulate them, he has missed a trick - to justify the story within them! Therefore it feels like you are watching someone else play a video game, where the main protagonist has 9 Lives and reaches number 8 before he succeeds to the final level boss - an underwhelming encounter with Benedict Cumberbiatch (sic) who says ""foff"" and the audience foff too, to recollect on a lost 2 hours. The score by Thomas Newman is also misplaced and passé - think a Hans Zimmer rendition of Lord of the Rings'. The only redeeming feature is the cinematography by Roger Deakins, yet even here, it inevitably draws comparison to the superior cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki ('Children of Men'), and whilst it is interesting to purely admire the technical achievement and continuous mis-en-scene in one shot (with hidden cuts), I think such a scheme ultimately ends up stealing the emotional veracity from the characters since we never really get up close and personal to them to see their eyes - their windows to the soul. The distance makes for a mute joy ride, and it is a shame as rather then free Deakins to bring out the best in the visuals, the one-shot idea has constrained him. There is to my knowledge only two great audio-visual works on WW1 and they are Blackadder Goes Forth (TV Series) and 'Paths of Glory' (Kubrick), alongside great films about all wars, from 'Full Metal Jacket' to 'Apocalypse Now', 'Catch 22', 'Salvador', 'The Battle of Algiers', to name but a few.",

514,18 January 2020,MOscarbradley,6, An unnecessary display of technical virtuosity,"Apart from the 'Will it, Won't it win Best Picture', the main talking point regarding ""1917"" is the fact that it was filmed in a single take, though of course it wasn't. Mendes shot the film in a number of seamless takes that give the impression the whole thing is happening in real time with only one obvious break midway through when the screen goes black to signify the passage of time from day to night; otherwise, all the events we see would seem to take place over the film's two hour running time and that's where my problem with the picture lies.",

I have read film critics copiously bandy about the descriptor ""immersive"" when attempting to justify effusive praise for this film the same way ""pathos"" is and has been inevitably invoked to describe the films of Charlie Chaplin. I suppose ""immersive"" does seem like a good fit in a film with a singular linear narrative; on the other hand, with such simple storytelling at play, were 1917 not ""immersive,"" it would be an utter failure.",

519,29 June 2020,elovette,10, Excellent and accurate depiction of the Hindenburg Line,I was amazed at how well done this movie is. Historically it is very accurate. It's basically about the German strategic withdrawal in 1917 to shorten their lines. They withdrew 9 miles in this case and the Allies assumed it was a ruse. So the story is about two soldiers attempting to warn their comrades that it is not a ruse....that the Germans have simply withdrawn to the much stronger Hindenburg line. One of the best WW1 movies I have seen in many years.,

This movie takes the Birdman approach and tries to make the entire film look like it was filmed all in one take.

Brilliantly directed by Sam Mendes, the film is everything you would want it to be. At times the pacing may seem to take a dip, but the emotional impact of the characters, is more than enough for you to stick around. The film is also shot beautifully, and makes for by far the most engaging film to grace the screen this year. All actors involved truly give it their all, and all characters seem to truly not only look real but feel real as well. In the end, 1917 is by far a technical achievement, but is also unlike anything we have seenn before in this genre, and is more than able to hold itself to that.

568,12 January 2020,ccamp89,5, Solid 2.5 // Shallow Spectacle,"For better or worse, 1917 is a film in which seemingly all the creative energy was focused on its technical elements. The extremely long takes are impressive, the fluid shot compositions arresting, the sets beautifully realized and convincing. But once that initial sense of awe inevitably wanes, it becomes naggingly clear that the film has nothing to offer beyond its visual splendor. It plays like a theme park ride, stringing together setpieces that offer superficial thrills but ultimately fail to engage on any emotional or intellectual level. It appears to be going for a hyperrealistic, you-are-there experience but never comes close to capturing any real sense of chaos or pandemonium. Everything feels too tightly-controlled and manicured to translate as the real thing, especially with the conspicuous direction constantly drawing attention to itself. It doesn't help either that the film seems to have an inflated sense of self-importance, as if all the theatrics are in service to some grand commentary on humanity, friendship, life, and death. In reality, it's a popcorn film that fancies itself a fine work of art, ultimately lacking in any real thematic or emotional depth. That isn't necessarily a bad thing; if you're primarily looking for a visual spectacle you're likely to be satisfied. If that's the case, I'd even recommend it. I fully applaud the effort and skill it took to make, though wish I could say it was in service to something more than killing two hours nursing your calorie-dense snack of choice.",

Sam Mendes (Spectre/American Beauty) has co-scripted an ambitious meditation on duty & sacrifice plunging the viewer into the horrors of trench warfare by solely focusing on these 2 comrade in arms (George Mackay, Dean Charles-Chapman) who take on this suicide mission (Chapman's brother is part of the unit they're heading to) when the odds aren't especially great. This visceral quest is felt in almost every frame as the dirt, blood & weirdly flowers engulf the screen making the experience a singular event. Yes one could argue that the sheer propensity of episodes (an enemy plane crash near one of the pair's stops, meeting up w/a French woman caring for an orphaned baby, a sniper attack which needs to be dealt with) may cause some audience members to decry 'come on!' but this may be the most intimate of epics put to screen so relish it while you can. Co-starring some Brit heavy hitters like Mark Strong, Colin Firth, Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch & Richard Madden.",
571,26 August 2020,leonblackwood,5," Great cinematography, average story! 5/10","Review:
Now I know that a lot of people think that this is a cinematic masterpiece and that Sam Mendes deserves every award under the sun, but I personally think that it is just a toned-down version of Saving Private Ryan with some dull actors. There are some A-listers popping in and out of the film, but the main character, Schofield (George MacKay) didn't have any screen charisma. I know that it was made to look like it was one shot, which was extremely clever, and an amazing achievement from Sam Mendes, but I personally think that the film wasn't anything that we haven't seen before. I appreciate the amazing effort that was put into the timing of each scene, which must have been difficult to achieve because of the flow of the film, but from an entertainment point of view, I did drift off a couple of times. If they had put an actor in the same category as Tom Hanks, then I would have agreed with the critics and a lot of the viewers, but I honestly can say that I wasn't in a rush to watch the movie again, once it had finished. It felt like a bit of an anti-climax when Schofield reached his destination, after everything that he had been through, and Cumberbatch made it clear how he felt about his presence. That's the main difference between this film and Saving Private Ryan. They actually fought together to get out of the mess they were in, once they reached their destination. I know that Schofield saved many life's by delivering the message but I was expecting fireworks at the end. Anyway, I'll give Sam Mendes props for the cinematography, but there are better war films out there. Watchable!",

In 2020 he may have struck Gold again with this beautifully shot and inspirational story in 1917.,
574,28 January 2020,dchipoco,8, Life at the trenches,"Simple story, yet touching, a look of the final stage of World War I through the look of a soldier who needs to carry an important message far beyond no man's land. The staging is amazing, there are diverse sceneries which do not repeat in the movie and, specially the trenches, are recreated in a realistic way. The sound mix gets you into the mood of the film and have touching compositions. The camera is in third person, so you go with the protagonist throughout his journey. I think that there were some part of the story that could have been closed in a better way at the end, but overall the film gets you into the suffering of this soldier and the struggle to fulfill his important mission, while getting the audience into a clear representation of the life at the trenches.",

The amount of hardwork and dedication shown by the whole crew is truly commendable. The camera work, the editing, the direction; everything gelled together in perfection. It seriously couldn't get any better. No doubt it won 3 Oscars for Cinematography, Visual and Sound Design! It will be set as the epitome of Camera work for many times to come.",
576,12 January 2020,CubsandCulture,7, Technique gets in the way of any otherwise engaging film,This is something like a more traditional (and thus for my taste better) version of Dunkirk. The film is as much about what time means in light of death as it is about The Great War. It has an operatic scope. The storyline is sparse and the dialog spartan. But the characters are more clearly defined in this film than Dunkirk. There is a stronger central plot and a better sense of narrative momentum. If you hated Dunkirk but thought maybe the concept could work this is a film to see.,

It was also well performed. While 1917 is not the most action packed war movie, it makes up for it with it's stark realism . 1917 shows the loss of innocence and the horrors of war in a manner not really seen before. This takes you to the battlefield amongst the rats and rotting corpses and drags you through the mud for the first modern war in history and is a grim and harsh tale of survival. This is a slow burn of a cinematic journey, but not one you will soon forget. Very gripping and excellent all around.",

582,29 January 2023,punch_1,9, Mendes creates one of the best films released in 2019.,"Many family members hear the proverbial quote ""war stories,"" but Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes takes the process a step further by turning his grandfather's adventures into a first-class movie that deserves to earn him another night at the Oscars. Switching gears from his Oscar-winning film American Beauty for his new movie 1917, Mendes recaptures what he heard about his grandfather's exploits during World War One fighting Germany in the trenches. Those words, ""fighting,"" and ""trenches"" take on heightened meaning through astounding sets and dynamic cinematography as a camera gets at eye level through what feels like a non-stop race in tight, miserable quarters. Starting with a command to get from one side to the other as quickly as possible, the camera rolls forward with hardly a stop, pushing action forward clearly but without a break in a phenomenal example of why the root word ""move"" create the term ""movie."" 1917 runs in the long war-related tradition of a Greek athlete at Marathon or the tension created for Australians at Gallipoli. With instructions to deliver a vital message to avert further battlefield debacles, two soldiers in the movie 1917 rush forward, carrying written orders from their commander. But forget any well-groomed trail or convenient running garb; they deal with the worst of man and nature, with no assurance of success even if they get their message to its destination. Little-known actors George MacKay and Dean Charles Chapman display the youth and energy required in their lead roles; the more familiar faces of Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Richard Madden from Game of Thrones step in for remarkably brief moments, signaling that everyone wants to work with a director as good as Sam Mendes. Rightfully so; in exploring a couple of days in the year 1917, Mendes creates one of the best films released in 2019.",
583,14 February 2020,TheLegio,8, Solid warlike film. 1 point more if you see it on cinemas,The picture and sound of this film is the best it has. It manages to put you in a situation it has not been that much exploited in the industry (WWI) where the battle was really in the trenches (actually this element has big importance in the storyline). The story is simple but effective. It has a down grade at the 3/4 of the film were it calms down just before the ending but nothing that would spoil the experience. Totally recommended.,

585,13 January 2020,alansabljakovic-39044,8, Flawless on technical level,Roger Deakins' cinematography and visual style saved 1917 from being just a standard and almost boring movie. All the technical aspects are 10/10 and I would say the story is mostly fine. There were some illogical moments and second half of the movie really dragged. This is just a little weaker Dunkirk.,

The continuous camera shot is just on another level, Roger Deakins definitely deserved that Oscar. The attention to detail in a war ridden land is exemplary: The trenches, the underground tunnels, the fallen soldiers, the abandon buildings, and the vast valleys were all spectacular and felt very real, you feel as if you're in the middle of it all.

596,20 January 2020,jonathan_crowe12,9, If Saving Private Ryan is the best portrayal of WW2 then this is the best portrayal of WW1,"This film is a very good watch but it is very intense so you need to be in the right mood and know what to expect. The main character is very well acted and is able to portray the emotions and strain of war. The film is one continuous shot which is very impressive. It also shows all the horrors of the war. One of the best scenes shows the soldiers going over the top as the character runs along the front line. One very small criticism is that the main character is shot at a lot but a lot of bullets miss him even though the German soldiers are quite close to him. The main character is able to shoot a German in a tower from quite a long distance. This is because the main character has to be put in danger but obviously he can't die before his mission is over or the film would be over. When his mission is done there is very little recognition for the main characters journey which adds to the realism as the commanding offices have a lot of other issues to deal with which adds to the realism. The music is very good and the film looks very realistic. There is one scene with a plane crash which is very well done. Overall, this film is a brilliant portrayal of World War 1. There are a lot of World War 2 films but not many World War 1 films so this helps to address that. It may be too graphic for schools but it could be shown to show how awful the conflict was.",

I knew that this movie was gonna be good because it got nominated for so many awards and I can see now why it received so much accolade. I know the one-shot thing is a big deal because it is. I mean, it's absolutely insane how they managed to do that! Mad props to the entire team. But the best things about this movie are the writing and cast. Whomever decided to cast George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman deserves a freaking raise because these guys are amazing actors. Especially George. I won't spoil anything but my god, the sheer terror and desperation on his face was so believable. And the cinematography is beautiful too, the composition and colours, the symbolism.

If I got truly sucked into the movie my rating would be a ten and this review would be different, but that never happened for me. Arguably derivative as a mix of Saving Private Ryan and Paths of Glory (a fantastic film), I felt mildly manipulated but far short of the personal invasion felt by watching the detestable War Horse.

The cinematography will prove to be a high point in the career of Roger Deakins - a career littered with more remarkable achievements than most working in any area of film. Somehow he conjured images and moment of striking beauty, nightmarish hellscapes, touching intimacy - all without sacrificing the narrative propulsion which the apparent one-take style serves; we're left with the sense that this story is but one part of an endlessly, relentlessly flowing river which is sweeping a whole generation mercilessly along.",

Even the rats looked like extras who had wandered in from a live action remake of Ratatouille. Did the filmmakers not see Peter Jackson's They Shall Not Grow Old? About fifteen minutes in my wife and I knew with a certainty that one of the handsome chaps would not go the distance, and once the remaining handsome chap was on his own we knew with an even greater certainty that he would meet a cowering French peasant girl in a barn or cellar, and that she would be clutching an infant while shells exploded overhead, and sure enough, about forty minutes later, there she was, fresh from having her tumbling golden curls blown out at a good salon. We relished the interiors of the buildings in the ruined town, where patches of brick showed through the plaster walls with all the gritty realism of the decor of a 1950's Italian restaurant in Newark. And to yank us out of the movie right when we might have been giving over to it in spite of ourselves, cameos by Patrick Melrose and Robb Stark!

624,1 March 2020,tarantino_feet_pics,8, Thoughts on 1917,"Beautiful cinematography by Roger Deakins. The scene at night in the ruins that are lit by flares and fire is fantastic. Two simple shots stand out to me; the first being in the beginning when the two protagonists walk around a body of water and the camera parts from them, goes to the waters surface and follows them from the side as they cross. The second being when Schofield sits to listen to the solider sing to his compatriots. The camera weaves in between the crowd of listeners to come back on Schofield. Very good costumes. Great set design and dressing. The film is filled with soldiers dirtied in the trenches; smoking, drinking, sleeping and tending to wounds. Locations are filled with ruins, craters, barred wire, old posters, fires, rubble and dead bodies. Everything in the foreground and background does a great job to feel like an authentic WW1 movie. The one shot element does a great job helping convey passage of time as well as really make the movie feel like one continuous journey. All the events on the way to the destination are great and exciting to watch. The death of Blake served as a great way to create stakes very shortly into the movie's runtime as well a create a good character moment between Schofield and Blake's brother. The last 25 minutes or so are great. The quick tempo ticking score gives a sense of urgency.",

I hadn't anticipated any film like this for a while and well it was great, perhaps not quite as great as my too high expectations were at one point, but still very good.
Acting was mostly good, but I did find Andrew Scott's character to be a bit too cliche and the move was perhaps very slightly a bit too unbelievable at times, but not too much.
This movie was made to appear as being just a single shot and I feel like that it fit this movie very well. In the beginning it was slightly claustrophobic, but overall it was great seeing the whole journey and kind of being a part of it. The films looks amazing (cinematography is mostly fantastic) and during the final moments of the movie the white trench section just looked amazing. The running/attack scene during the final moments was very epic. I feel like I am going to have to give this movie another watch in the future to fully appreciate it, or maybe I will find more faults in it.
The score wasn't outstanding but good and the overall sound of the film was good, not deafening unlike in some other movies these days. This was a great movie.",

If you dont want a cliche dont watch a war film simple.

It's honestly poor writing, for the sake of building the drama/suspense... but having the main character in your movie make stupid descisions simply to raise the suspense level is a very scummy writing tactic because the writer hopes that the viewer won't notice it (sorry, but I noticed).",

Not just barbed wire and bomb craters, the two lance corporals crawl over rotting human corpses and dead horses to get to the German lines.

I saw it in the largest possible format and the biggest screen I could find and it was totally worth it. This is a movie you should pay and watch. This is pure film making art. The direction, cinematography, editing, music, production design, makeup and costume, acting and all other departments were just simply perfect. I don't know which I liked more, Parasite or 1917.

652,18 January 2020,durham100,5, Over hyped and over the top reviews. (no pun intended),"The first ten minutes or so is fantastic, the one shot thing works and suits that part of the film. But for the rest of the film all it does is get in the way. It prevents you from getting into the film and you can almost see the actors and extras have been waiting for the camera to come to them so they can do their bit. The story is flimsy and empty. Some of the sets, especially the bombed out buildings at night, are so obviously sets this even more takes you out of the film. Aside from the opening, I was aware every minute that I was watching a movie. The acting is fine though under the circumstances, the action sequences are limp and unbelievable as are many of the events that happen along the way - these mostly feel like fillers to pad the film out and many are very heavy handed visual bits that simply do not come off.
It isn't a bad film by any means, but it isnt the masterpiece it is being made out to be and there are many better war films out there that do not sacrifice so much substance for style. Even the music in many places is inappropiate and intrusive. By all means go see it, but remember you don't have to think it is the bees knees just because the critics say it is.",

You really rooted for the two actors and felt their fear and exhaustion and adrenaline. It had great use of music to heighten the suspenseful nature but contrasted the movie with softer scenes like the woman and the baby to remind us of humanity and the harshness of war.
The actor George Mackay is brilliant and you really felt his fear throughout the whole story.
This film also helps those who have not been to war nor had family lineage who was in the army, empathize with the experiences ppl have in war and help them understand the sacrifices ppl made during those times. It also shows the senselessness of war and the small amount of power a soldier has in relation to his superiors and circumstances of politics.",

Cinematography sure it looks cool (looks as if it's all filmed in one shot) but It could have been a better movie with cuts. The plot is absurd. That the only way to save all these men, is that two men go on ahead to said group and hand their leader a piece of paper?... They carry all these supplies hardly none that can help them (bayonets & shovels) never stopping to actually read the map, or a compass. No military dialogue. They point their gun barrels at each other whilst traveling. Not shocked over the dead bodies everywhere (rats crawling out of) but actually stop the take Jesus' name in vain when they see cherry trees chopped down. Not looking to see who squeezed the milk out of a random cow, but hap hazard fills the canteen (that later comes into play to feed a random baby) Where is the girl getting kerosene for her lamps, by the way? Single chopped down trees that block the road way, when a child could just drive around them... Or swimming through dozens of dead bodies when you could have swam another few feet and avoided all of that mess. A random guy singing in the woods whilst a whole platoon is entranced by his angelic voice... The ""F"" word through out this movie does not fit at all, and Christ name would have been said out loud in those times, but more because of prayer that they might be going to meet their maker. The more I think about it the more I disliked it. This was a complete mess, filled with inaccuracies. How in the heck is this movie rated so high?",

""1917"" shows the human sacrifice involved and the camaraderie that helped many survive and endure. Two British soldiers are assigned to brave no man's land in order to warn a battalion of fellow Brits not to attack as they're set for a trap by their wily German foes. The ensuing drama is an odysseyan tale of tragedy, warfare, hardship, humanity, endurance and a race against time. Good acting and a ground-level view of the story bring a realism conveying the realities of war as gunfire, explosions, fistfights, blood and death take place amidst the hellish backdrop of filthy trenches, putrid water, barbed wire, craters, corpses, grimy uniforms and dazed, angry, mud-drenched soldiers who've seen it all. The only qualm I have with the film is the length. Clocking in at nearly two hours the time pushes the script to the point of tedium considering the story is very much a solitary affair that would have best been served as a short or an hour long flick. A surprise hit and nominated for several awards ""1917"" proved and showed that there is a worldwide audience for historical war films that depict war not as what people want it to be but what it truly is.",

Sam mender is back from his earlier lacklustre film with a bang this is his most personal film because the story is about his grandfather who served world war 1 and it talks about the sheer humanity and going forward to finish what is started the fantastic capability of a person's state of mind the humongaus will power to complete the mission in order to save one's brothers in arms is goosebump enducing and tear jerking and coming to another master who is sir Roger deakins who masterfully shot the film which is one take my God how he and editor and Sam Mendes filmed those impossible scenes that is just crazy to just think only.

It is incredibly emotionally and I was on the verge of tears several times. I also jumped several times during some very tense moments. The cameos from several famous British faces are not distracting as some critics have claimed and you feel mild relief during these moments as if you have seen a familiar face.
The two leads are very good but it is the outstanding direction that makes this the best war film I've seen. The set pieces are almost beautiful at times (strange to say about a war film I know). There are two sequences in particular that my mouth dropped open watching for the visual effects alone.

701,20 February 2020,patriciogl10,8, A POV cinematic experience.,"Even if you aren't into war films, 1917 is a film one must experience, because there is a simple story, sufficient and efficient, backed by an extraordinary technical accomplishment, which pretty much shapes and enlarges the cinematic experience to the highest degree. The pace just flows flawlessly frame after frame; to me it was intoxicating to have such a personal point of view, it certainly enriched the momentum, it made everything feel more tense, up close yet distant. I was very eager to see what would happen next and how the story would ultimately unfold. We don't get to see the known horrors of war in a crude fashion as it wasn't intended, but we get to witness glimpses of hope and tenderness which add to the emotional impact of the film. And I have to say those moments are necessary because something else is needed besides the constant suspense and continuous turbulent path towards the success of the corporates' mission, otherwise it's hard to feel something for these characters, given that it takes place in a constricted time frame and with a clear objective, that it doesn't leave much room for a film's usual way of progressing.",
702,29 February 2020,MovieWarfare,9, Film making in its glory,"People call this film ""The Birdman of WWI"" and to be fair that is a justified assessment. This entire film is filmed like it is one camera shot and it is AWESOME! think one of the most impressive thing apart from the one looking shot is the AMAZING CINEMATOGRAPHY. This shouldn't be no surprising since it is the legend himself Roger Deakins (Blade Runner 2049 Cinematographer). Every scene feels like a painting and it is absolutely stunning. There is a scene at night where the lighting was done in such a creative way that heighten the tension of the scene. On that note there must also be praise for the score by Thomas Newman who somehow manages to make a score that somehow manages toe elevate every scene and help tell the story. There is also some amazing sound design that manages to make the War actually scary with moments that give horror movie jump scares a run for its money. Additionally, the props and set design should also get praise for creating such large,realistic but elaborate sets to accommodate for a more natural one shot scene. Everything in this film just feels like a technical achievement. We haven't even touched on the acting or story yet but just for the way this was filmed is already engaging enough. Nevertheless, the two main actors George MacKay as Lance Corporal William ""Will"" Schofield and Dean-Charles Chapma as Lance Corporal Thomas ""Tom"" Blake manages to do a phenomenal job in showing the horror of war and giving authentic,believable characters. The story, while relatively simple, is engaging enough to keep you invested in the objective of the main characters. They must send a message to allies stop them running into a trap. It's simple but works well for the aim of one shot as now it makes the audience a part of the journey.",
703,11 January 2020,galahad58-1,8, Two Shot,"1917 is a wonderful look at the WWI experience. It brings trench life, dealing with mud, dealing with rats, the perspective of the trench charge, bodies left to rot in no-man's land, and other aspects of WWI to life. 1917 has a decent story that allows the creative team to explore the life and trials of a British soldier from that time frame.
The idea of having a two shot movie was interesting. While the movie was a consistent flow that focused on the two stars, it did slow the pace of the film and it limited what the story could have been - now that is saying it could have been a 9/10 story but was stuck in the mud to bring the story to a 7/8.
The other downfall of the two shot movie was that there was less of an opportunity to bring the two mains to life. It felt (from a veteran's perspective) that you were watching another squad go through this experience with no investment. It still did not lower the movie, but it made you wonder how much better the film could have been had there been a few more breaks in the shots to bring more story and depth to the characters.
Still a solid 8 movie.",

Technically the film is a triumph and the urgency pours through the screen. There is little time given to dwell on events and the pace is relentless, with several high budget and expertly choreographed sequences to admire. Character development and dialogue are efficient and we get an impressively long list of both establishment and newcomer British actors.",

710,4 February 2020,batichiste,8, Stunning,"This film is so amazing in all aspects.
First of all George MacKay is outstanding in this movie. I don't know why didn't he get at least a nomination. Production design is great. The way Sam Mendes managed to create the atmosphere of the Great War is truly Oscar winning. Directing is also marvellous. While I was watching the movie, i was saying to myself: ""wow this guy just earned an Oscar"". It's amazing how they made the movie look like it's a one shot take. This portrays the duty of soldiers in this cases, meaning that they can't lose a second or their purpose will be affected. As the movie slogan states: ""Time is the enemy"".
For this I outline the amazing director's work and Oscar winning cinematographer Roger Deakins. The script is very good, solid and entertaining. You really get to connect with the characters and fell their emotions, starting from the nap at the beginning to the resting in the tree at the end. It's also emotionally strong since the script takes the WWI atmosphere very crudely showing the horrors of war.
Finally sound. Wow. I jumped scared in one of the scenes because of the sound of an explosion I think this is one of the strong points that this movie has. It really immerses you in the environment. When planes pass by the sound of the engine leaves you deaf (not really but).
So, if you have the time and money to waste in this movie just do it, you will have a good time.",

There are many things I liked about it, such as the tension at the start, the depiction of life in the trenches, the artistic way the horrors of war are presented, the fact you're never quite sure what's going on in the bigger picture and it really does emphasize the pointlessness of the whole concept of war. However, the actual events that occur along the way feel too staged and don't flow into each other very well, and everything just kind of happens with little fuss.

744,22 January 2020,stankactorman,10, Deserves every Oscar nom,"1917: A different kind of war movie: Up close and personal. Opening shot: a bucolic field of wild flowers, a lovely, calm day, blue cloudless sky, quite, serine, slowly pulls back to reveal a bivouac of British troops, sleeping, smoking, eating, refreshing, resting, waiting. It's WWI. The phone lines have been cut and two British soldiers are called to the Commanding General's bunker and are given the mission to deliver a message to the commander of another regiment a few miles away, that they must call off a planned attack scheduled for dawn the following morning because the German army has set a trap that will ensure the massacre of 1600 men, one of whom is the brother of one of the soldiers. We go along with them through enemy territory, through the mud and over the bodies of the dead, determined to complete their harrowing mission. The entire film looks like it was shot in real time in one continuous take with a hand-held steady cam. The cuts are nearly imperceptible. Birdman employed this technique wonderfully, but this endeavor far surpasses that in artistry, complexity, scope and length. This is a technical achievement without comparison. But technical achievement means nothing if there is no compelling story and investment in the characters and 1917 delivers. We are drawn in to the action so closely that we almost duck when bullets start flying. We care deeply about these two young men. It's edge-of-your-seat tension. The score by Thomas Newman enhances every moment and is profoundly moving. We're aware of it, but it doesn't call attention to itself as our pulses race along with the action. The production design is brilliant. Roger Deakins is probably the greatest cinematographer of all time. He was also the A camera operator and I can only imagine how he and director Sam Mendes managed to pull this off. I read they were in rehearsal for six months planning every shot. Score: 10. GO!

Just actions. Thomas Newman's soundtrack is brilliant and suiting, photography is decent but color grading is lacklustre and monotonous (compared to Dunkirk). When you talk about experience films you've got to get soundtrack and cinematography matching the tension you want to create. It worked perfectly with Hans Zimmer and Hoyte van Hoytema in Dunkirk but 1917 lacks it for some reason which cuts off the tension a couple of times and then you've to rebuild again.

But because the general is in a bad position to communicate with troops under his command and because the Germans have magically destroyed all the telephone lines, the general decides
1. Wait for an hour or so for the telephone lines to be repaired and then calls off the attack
2. Sends a runner back to headquarters to which sends a message by telephone to a place where they can send a runner to call off the attack.
3. Sends their driver (they are a general, they would have a driver) to deliver the message via the roads around the area.
4. Relocates their headquarters to a central location where they can communicate more easily with troops under his command.
5. Use a set of runners to run behind the lines in shifts to get the message to call off the attack to the troops.

764,12 February 2021,ChristianLeFeuvre,10, One of the best war films I've seen,"There have been some incredible war films in the past, 'Saving Private Ryan', 'All Quiet On The Western Front' and of course 'Schindler's List' but the 2019 release, both written and directed by Sam Mendes, '1917' is easily one of the best.
George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman star as two soldiers in the middle of World War 1, who are sent across enemy lines, and deep into enemy territory, to deliver an urgent message that will result in the saving of 1600 lives.
My first mention has to go to cinematographer Roger Deakins. This is an outstandingly beautifully shot movie. It has been filmed to look like one continuous shot, following these two soldiers through a war.
Obviously, there are moments in the film where I'm sure cuts were made, darkness obscures the screen for a moment, but despite that, this is a massive technical achievement and the brilliance of it can not be ignored. As they progress from the open graveyard of no man's land to the abandoned but still dangerous German trenches, the unexpected fallout from a dogfight to a burning town in the dead of night, most audiences will quickly stop thinking about the technique at play and simply give themselves over, entirely, to this journey into hell.
The production, costume and pace of the film are simply perfect. It takes you along on their mission as if you are with them and there are some seriously edgy moments too.
The thing I loved about the film, well one of the things I loved about the film, is the feeling of 'realism'. It isn't a sweet, sentimental, predictable jaunt, it's full of problems for these guys. They come across trip-wires underground, deserted villages where you're not sure if they are actually deserted. It's seriously nerve-wracking, you never feel like they're safe, this is done so well in this film, they always feel like there's someone just around the corner.
One sequence, in particular, is so intense. One of the characters is running through this rubble and flares are going off, and gunfire can be heard in the background and you think at any second, one of these bullets could hit this guy, and the music is rising, along with the tension, it is 'edge of your seat' stuff.
The acting is, well simply outstanding. Director Sam Mendes wanted to make sure the lead characters were not 'big names' and relatively unknowns and this was an excellent choice as it made you care more about the actual characters.
There are a few 'names' as cameos, Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong and Andrew Scott make appearances but it's the leads that you invest in.",
765,9 February 2020,jamiedarlow-37510,7, A visually masterful treat and another great outing for Sam Mendes,"Set throughout the course of 24 hours during April 1917, two young soldiers in World War I (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman) are given a mission by their general to travel from their bunker to one deep into enemy territory to warn a regiment of the British army to call off their attack at the break of dawn. There's strong intel that is a trap and in order to save the lives of 1600 men, one of which is one of the protagonists brothers, they need to reach the bunker in time. Sam Mendes is one of today's greatest directors; absolute classics like American Beauty and Road To Perdition and two great Bond films under his belt, make anything his name is attached to worth a watch. It's beautifully dedicated to Lance Corporal Arthur Mendes as mentioned in the credits which give it a moving personal touch. Visually it is incredible and works on the basis of feeling like one continuous shot. I've always loved this idea since I was young and adored films that incorporate this even just for certain scenes such as Alfonso Cuaron's Children Of Men or that great episode of Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton's Psychoville. So this really pleased me from a cinephile perspective! On a technical level, it is a massively impressive achievement and its first hour in particular is non stop intensity, it's truly captivating. I'm sad to admit though that there are a couple of scenes in the last half that I did feel meandered and took me out of the experience a fair bit. There are moments in there designed as a breather from the drama which I felt would be okay if I was more engaged on an emotional level. The performances are absolutely spectacular still, it's just that it's a film written more with the visual scope and atmosphere in mind than necessarily character. Nevertheless, definately worth a watch on the biggest screen you can find!",

767,27 April 2020,robertmaybeth,6, I'll say an unpopular opinion: Just ok,"I just finished watching this and while it's not the worst war movie ever made it's not the best either.
The novel thing about this movie is the non-stop linear action. It's a style that's rarely been done before and in this movie they make it work. Most of the movie is suspense, muck, mud, mire and fear and this movie does a good job of portraying the squalor of WW1 trench life.",

Here's some questions for you: Would you stand in an open field watching an enemy plane get shot down above you and not move an inch until it almost crashes in to you? Would you try to save the enemy from the burning plane after your own guys put effort in to shooting him down? Would you discover a pail of milk and fill your canteen with it instead of the nearby water outlet? Would the obviously resourceful enemy leave the milk just sitting there? Would the enemy leave the dairy cow alive, knowing their enemy would soon be there, low on supplies? Then, would you give your milk away to a woman with a baby? (gee, how convenient.) Would a truck driver in an open field drive through the only mud puddle for no reason only to get stuck? I'll stop here. The movie was ok, way to simple of a plot, and way too many holes. I didn't appreciate the unnecessary editing magic that eliminated any/all cuts. Hope this helps.",
770,14 February 2020,matthewmiller-86135,1, Review from a combat war movie veteran!,"This is not a WWI movie ,its more like a polished ,fake, made up, documentary that has major Hollywood puff added. This 1917 movie is not good, it has beautiful scenes of trenches and bunkers, that's it! What it dose not provide is a visceral,brutal,horrifying,bloody or truthful depiction of what it was really like (or even a half attempt) in the trenches of WWI, if that's what you want don't look here! Hell, This movie did not even try to convey the Three most terrifying words in wwi... ""men prepare bayonets!
Also, Anyone saying this movie is like Saving Private Ryan only watched the first 10 minutes of the movie! Because after that 1917 really gets bad, I'm talking snooze fest bad! If anyone wants to watch a really well made, great WWI movie check out THE LOST BATTALION, it was made twenty years ago and blows this 1917 movie out of the water!",

If you want to see this, make an effort to see it in a theater. The number one thing that the theater enhances about the movie is the cinematography. This is the movie that deserves to win Best Cinematography at The Academy Awards. At one point of the movie, there is a straight 30 minutes or so that is the best cinematography of the last 2 years by a landslide. You learn about the characters and their dynamics with eachother through their dialogue and how they react to the situations they are put in. The score was used so effectively and made the scenes so much more intense. Also, it (the score) was very good. I wanted to stay for the credits because I wanted to listen to it. I can't decide if this movie, Marriage Story, or Joker should win Best Score at The Oscars, but I'd be happy with any of these. The sound mixing was another extremely effective aspect of this movie, and to quote my dad, ""The gun shots are the most realistic I've ever heard."" This movie should absolutely win the Oscar for it's sound editing. I also really hope that the movie wins the Oscar for Achievements in Makeup and Hairstyling. All of the dirt, blood, and water in this movie looked so realistic and amazing, but Bombshell will most likely win the award. This movie, Parasite, and Knives Out are all tied for me as to what I think should win Best Screenplay. And finally, regarding Best Picture, as long as this or Marriage Story wins, I will be happy. And to top all of these things off, the movie takes place on my birthday.",

But seriously, not to take away from Parasite's deserved success, and politics aside, 1917 in my opinion was the best movie of the group, this coming from someone who is a) not into war movies and b) feels that war movies automatically gets a nomination even if there were more deserving movies instead (I'm talking to you, Hacksaw Ridge and American Sniper.)

My complaints are technical in nature; given the urgency of the message a smart general would have sent multiple, larger squads to ensure that at least one got thru. Secondly, a pilot could have delivered the message in a matter of minutes. So, you have to suspend disbelief on these accounts.

The scenery is barren but scattered with the horrors of war.

A great movie has as its bedrock a great story line and plot. This comes up well short in the plot department. WWI was chaos without doubt but the military was not commanded by complete idiots as the plot line would have us believe. There is no possible such an incredibly import job would be handled in the way portrayed. The movie was full of cliches and the usual war movie tropes. 1917 has been promoted as a ""one take"" movie but ........it isn't. Dont get me wrong, the camera work is outstanding but the rest ...... not so much. The settings just failed to achieve realism in most cases .... trenches too clean for one thing. Even the No-Man's land carnage didn't look ...... right! The is a solid 6 and maybe I might be convinced to stretch it to a 6.5 but it certainly isn't a 10. An Oscar winner? Given the hype it could be a chance but the right movie quite often doesnt win the Best Movie Oscar, afterall Hollywood has always been politics over substance. One final note. The Helmets the Brits were wearing ....... something about them was not right and that was a distraction throughout the movie. A great movie would get the details right.",

Colin Firth's General Erinmore has an urgent message to send to the Devonshire regiment further up the front line. Do Not Attack, he has seen aerial footage that shows they are walking into a trap. But the German have cut the telegraph wires, and the only way to get through to Écoust-Saint-Mein is on foot.",
817,11 January 2020,mwnareff,10, A magnificent and grueling tribute to bravery,1917 is stunning in both its visual impact as well as its acting. I have long been a fan of war movies that are done well and this film is the epitome of powerful storytelling of war. Sam Mendes' decision to use a single shot format carries the audience through the trenches with the soldiers. Their fear is palpable and translates from the screen to the theatre. And Thomas Newman's lyrical score provides a superb background to the story-never intrusive but enhances the action. I cannot capture the excellence of the two chief actors who set a high bar for the big names that support them in the story. 1917 is certain to be a classic-I know it will be one of my all-time favorite movie experiences.,

Sometimes the technical aspects of creating the illusion that everything we see is being shot in one take, dominate the story and the human implications.
But Mendes manages to keep the balance most of the time, supported of course by extraordinary young actors, who make the journey believable.
What i liked most were the moments of silence, of grief, of melancholy, the singing soldier in the wood, the surrealism of huge burning buildings at night, the loss of orientation in life-threatening situations. This exciting experience wouldn't work without Deakins brilliant cinematography, which is the real Oscar-worthy part here in my opinion.",

853,16 January 2020,dannocummings,9," Not just a movie, but an experience","This film is easily the most immersive movie I have seen all year. From the time the title card was displayed until the time the credits rolled, I was totally enthralled by the events of the film. 1917 had me on the edge of my seat for 2 hours straight and left me feeling as if I had just endured the events firsthand.
Storytelling - 1917 was basically 2 hours of great decision-making. The film drops the viewer off at the best possible moment so that we truly feel as if we are in the situation. This is a feeling that, although established immediately, lingers for the entirety of the film's runtime. Every emotion that the characters felt throughout the movie-dress, fear, despair, triumph, anger- I felt right alongside them. The film strays far from the formula typical to most movies, causing a pervasive sensation unpredictability and fear. Overall, while the story was limited in its scope by the fact that it was almost actual-time, it soars through its unique style and extreme realism. 9/10
Acting - The acting in this film is truly masterful. The two leads did a fantastic job of portraying their characters in manner that helped the audience sympathize with them almost immediately. Certain sequences required the actors convey a wide variety of emotion using nothing but their facial expressions. Once again, the film moves at such a pace that it is very hard for the actors to slow down and really explore deeper emotions, but the still played their parts expertly. 9/10
Script - 1917 has considerably less dialogue than many films that came out this year. This kept it from being as deep as other films, and yet, like all the other categories, it worked fantastically for the film. There were definitely hints of depth and history between certain characters found in the lines, and I cannot complain on any level. 9/10
Characters - This is where the film was impacted most by the frenetic pace. It was very rare that the two leads were not in an extremely tense, life-threatening situation which made it very hard to delve into their characters and understand more about them. It's hard to truly complain about the characters, but they certainly were not as well-explored as some other films. It worked great for the film, but I still feel as if I should maintain a single standard for all films. 8/10
Cinematography - I'll keep this brief. The best cinematography of the year. Hands down. Constant, superb decision-making from Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins made this film stand out among the dozens of war films that have been released and created one of the best film experiences I have ever had. 10/10
Personal opinion - As always, I factor in the way that I personally felt about the film. I left this movie feeling as if I had seen a huge step for film in general. The way this film was crafted truly make it a work of art. I typically prefer strong er characters, but 1917 did everything he could do to strengthen the characters and, with minimal work from the audience, the characters develop quite nicely all things considered. I adored this film and cannot wait to experience it again. I personally give this film a 9/10. Overall, the score evens out to be 9.0/10.",

For instance, I don't know how they pulled off certain character's not breathing after they die. Sure they can hold their breath, but considering one ""dead"" actor remains on the screen for a good minute or more makes that unlikely. Anyhow - awesome movie and highly recommended!

866,15 February 2020,denis888,8, Very Good War Movie But Certainly Not The Oscar Movie Of The Year,"Sam Mendes took an enormous task to cover with this vast war epic - he decided to show just 24 hours of a war-torn day in 1917, April, through the means of a seemingly uninterrupted endless camera shot so that we could witness the whole event as if through the eyes of a main hero, Lance Corporal William ""Will"" Schofield, here depicted masterfully by George MacKay. Alongside him, there's a whole array of wonderful British actors appearing here and there, such as Mark Strong as Captain Smith or excellent Benedict Cumberbatch as Colonel Mackenzie, or equally superb Colin Firth as General Erinmore.
This technique of a seamless single shot is nothing new, and here we see some obvious edits and cuts, which are not a tragic obstacle. Generally, the movie delivers the message extremely well, with a certain drawback being very obvious - the movie often drags and plods, thus losing much of its certain steam.
Several blatant mistakes and goofs apart, 1917 managed to impress me, but on one thing I surely agree - this was not the Movie of the year.",

I did not realize that this would become on of my favorite of the genre and just how much I would love it. This movie captures what real soldiers of the time must have felt. It drives home the idea that these soldiers werent out their just looking for a kill. These guys were people with friends and family and just wanted to keep them safe and see them again. The camaraderie between Blake and Schofield can be felt from the beginning. The movie takes off from the start but you can tell these two men have a friendship that has been through the worst of war. The movies really shows that none of these men are particularly in this war for glory. They are here to do their job and get home. Except for one man (late in the movie). The dialogue throughout isnt some grand speeches or long winded monologues, its straight and to the point but in a beautifully told way that again emphasizes the situation. The main characters convey such emotion visually as well. It's almost like you can feel it yourself. The actual filming itself is amazing as well.

The film itself is pretty linear and predictable so you can say that the plot is shallow in this respect but if ever you wanted a film to embed you in the movie rather than being a spectator then this is pretty damn close. The cinematography was amazing and the soundtrack just brilliant. To me this film was everything that Dunkirk was not.",

913,7 February 2020,GoatOfNeptune,9, Call of Duty,1917 is a hell of a ride and for shure the best cinematography of the year. Mendes keeps the pace over the whole film and the sound editing is also great.,
914,14 January 2020,cptbilko,10, The greatest WW1 film ever. The greatest war film ever?,My review of 1917.,
915,17 October 2020,GrandoFernando,4, Why such high ratings???,"To start with, if this film wasn't so completely overhyped, I would have given this a 6 or 7, but the fact that this film has been given stratospheric reviews, raised my expectations. The people that put together the montage to advertise the film, did a very good job, as they used the absolute best clips, which pprtrayed the film as a must watch. With regards to the best war film ever made, seriously? What idiots write this utter nonsense? Better than Platoon, Full metal jacket, yes those are vietnam. Well its not a patch on Dunkirk, saving private Ryan, the longest day, battle of the bulge, where eagles dare, guns of navarone, the list is endless but for a modern day adaptation of WW1 or WW2, this isn't a patch on Dunkirk. Maybe as this is based on WW1 and there hasn't been many examples to compare, this might be why people are raving about it? If that's the case, warhorse was way way better. I just don't get it as to why this is so widely acclaimed. I was so so looking forward to this and I was left utterly utterly disappointed to say the least. Worth a watch but nothing more",
916,20 June 2021,ThunderQunt,9, Deserving.,Finally gotten around to watching this and it was wonderful. Fully deserving of all its praise and awards.,
917,11 February 2020,andrewrkelly,10, Greatest war film ever!,"Twenty minutes into the film you will be gripped, by the end of this film you will realise you have just watched the greatest war film ever made, Sam mendes has created a real masterpiece.",
918,2 February 2020,samuelroper-353-107988,10, Simply amazing.,"Title says it all.
There's not many films where you can go to the cinema and be glued to the screen from start to finish, but this definitely does that.
From the moment I sat down to the moment the credits rolled up I was in suspense. The way this was filmed was on another level, which grips all the audience.
I have recommended to everyone who has asked about it and even to those who have not.
I watched it in a Superscreen which added to the cinematic experience.
A must see.",
919,18 October 2020,Real_Review,7, A Fine War Film. Rather Unremarkable.,"I'm a sucker for a good war epic. This film was certainly long enough to be considered an 'epic'. Unfortunately, there just isn't much to write about '1917' (2019). The casting was fine, but there were no great performances. As a matter of fact, no one really says much throughout the film. The underdeveloped characters go about their business and advance the story. I've seen this film three times now, and I never really get too invested. Because of the release date, some people will confuse this film with 'Dunkirk'. This is not on the same level of filmmaking as 'Dunkirk' (2017).",
920,17 February 2020,catpantry,7, They need to,"Get more wemon in these roles who aernt just standing within ten feet of an open house. At one point (when the st. Bernard was running on the treadmill) (in a cave) a woman flipped the light on in there saying: are you well, do you need five of my pounds. Now im not jesus or anything, but please, give it a chance for the fe_male gender. They could of at least showed a women in a double sized ford f-150 that had a 3 pound hand.",
921,18 January 2020,Hamlet61982,5, Good but overrated,"I watched this in the comfort of my bed (award consideration copy), its a good movie with great shots. However, when compared to saving private Ryan or black hawk down, it doesn't stand well. Why? There aren't enough in depth battle scenes to be captivated with. The friendship of the two doesn't have enough depth or poignancy to really make you care. It's almost as though the film was created by one person's recollection of a grandfather's old war stories.",
922,16 January 2020,clarkishome,7," Cinematography was fantastic, but story left a little bit wanting","With all the hype that is surrounding this film being nominated for best picture I expected more. Some of the scenes made me question why were they done in that manner. Overall it's a good solid (7) with beautiful scenes and fantastic cinematography. Personally, I could see it getting a couple of nods for some lower level awards at the Oscars, but I do not see this taking home best picture. I would definitely recommend seeing the movie it has the major components of a good war film.",
923,30 January 2020,kelasan,10, As true film was meant to be.,"This is what cinema was and hopefully will be again when the brain dead Millennials and GZs and those who serve them give way to a renaissance generation who embrace true film making anew. I feel sincerely sorry for the current youth who never grew up with classic film making. The marketing oriented sausage grinder tripe of today is enough to make those of us who know better weep crocodile tears (how's that for two run on sentences?). The franchise era should tossed on the scrap heap of history and be as quickly forgotten as it arose. Either that or relegate it to online streaming platforms that cater to the comatose masses. I sadly saw the last Star Wars installment a week before seeing this 1917. I thought I'd never go to the cinema again (it had been two years without a visit). I had abandoned all hope for film, but it sprung anew thanks to 1917. If it doesn't win best picture it will be all the evidence you ever needed that the fix has always been in, in Hollywood.",
924,28 November 2021,langerston,10, Realistic WWI Film,"What a great movie. Roger Deakins puts in some truly top-both cinematography, as is to be expected. When compared to Dunkirk, which is the main movie I hear people comparing 1917 to, the characterization here feels much more personal. The violence is quick and realistic and scary without being excessive, making this movie considerably more accessible than similar recent war films. The music, acting, set pieces, etc are all pretty much flawless, and the tracking shot technique works wonderfully. However, the fact that it still manages to tell such an intense and compelling story is the true wonder of 1917.",
925,4 January 2020,rt-90461,10, Outstanding treatment of a difficult subject,This is a masterclass in how to make a movie. The subject is difficult; most people are turned off by the horror of the First World War. But this film captures the realism with superbly portrayed characters whilst maintaining a fast moving storyline. The choice of the German retreat at the end of the First Somme was inspired (I was expecting 1917 to mean Passchendaele - it usually does). The particular incidents accord with accounts which I have read.,
926,17 April 2020,DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed,10, IT WAS A RIDE FROM START TO END 🚂 IT WAS A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE,This Was such an enjoyable event. It's another unique cinematic experience I have had the Joy of Witnessing. I already knew it had a lot of hype going in so I thought I would be disappointed because everything that is ever hyped is usually complete Garbage.,
927,15 January 2020,buckstoppers,10, If there ever was a movie that deserved an Oscar ...,"Brilliant!!! Absolutely brilliant!!!!
Cannot wait to get it on bluray just to see how they did half that stuff!",
928,15 February 2020,joshhw98,10, Loved it,1917 wow. What a film! From start to finish I was fully interested all the way through. Quite honestly one of the best war films I've seen for some time.,
929,29 February 2020,paulvanderveer-27714,10, Great moving movie,1917 is a great movie in which you feel involved from the beginning to the end. Great actors work as well. A movie which you can see a number of times.,
930,21 March 2020,bsamad-50088,7, Cinematography is excellent! Something else ? Mmm i am not sure,"I believe that this movie is just good , not too bad and not great at the same time , to be fair the cinematography in this movie is possibly the only thing that was amazing, rather than that i didn't feel i enjoyed it , the cinematography itself has flaws , some scenes are soo long , you see those two soldiers walk for 5 minutes and they just talk and tell some random boring stories and almost i fell asleep in some scenes, plus some plot holes , i don't know about explosives but with that explosion in that narrow room i think it would cause more damage to the two soldiers than what we saw in the movie , this movie in my opinion deserves no more than 7,5",
931,21 April 2020,ylshu-06641,9, 1917,"During the climax, my whole body muscle was locked in the theater seat, and the lacrimal gland began to collapse involuntarily. This movie represents the purest audition shock, the most extreme play of the movie language, and my back was completely wet when the subtitle was released.",
932,20 May 2020,rjal-1,10, ONE TAKE!,"It took me a while to realize that the camera didn't stop through the entire film. I had to go back and watch it over again to be sure. There is no editing in this film. This is a stage play or a ballet of sorts becuase there is no room to mess up. Besides that, it's an exciting and surprising WWI story which is always important to be told.",
933,10 January 2020,shawthingproductions,5, A missed opportunity.,"If you want to use relative unknowns in your film, do not then litter some Hollywood heavy-hitters in bit parts through out the film. Be brave and go with a complete cast of ""unknowns"". Don't just throw in Benedict, Mark Storm and others as it serves no purpose other than to pull the audience from the film. Not that it's a problem here because, the film isn't exactly brilliant anyway... Stilted dialogue, some shoddy performances, lacklustre music and what we have here is nothing more than a technical masterpiece because, credit where it is due, it IS that.",
934,23 April 2020,jfifejr,10, Epic..just plain epic,"I won't say much as I really want as many people to see this movie. It is everything a great film should be. Beautiful, moving. exciting, and provocative. The basic tale of a hero's journey through trials and tragedies told against the backdrop of a hellish war. You follow on a close personal level from the journey's beginning to end. Trading artsy cleverness and controversy for one man's story, 1917 is why basic story telling will never fail.",
935,19 January 2020,montyjackson-39179,10, Everything it could have lived up to be!,"1917 was a very moving display of the First World War and if any long loving veterans were alive today to see such a movie, I'm sure they would have been glad to see their experiences and stories told in such a successful way and if they could see the profound effect it had in some people I'm sure they would have been moved to tears. Overall will not be a movie to forget!",
936,13 February 2020,terryzhangtianrun,9, Outstanding movie wich only had one shot,"The movie mainly tells a story about two soldiers delivering a letter to an isolated regiment which is needed to cross through enemy's territory. The plot is simple, but the beautiful screens were unforgetable and the movie only used one shot ! It was amazing. I have some problems though,that how did George change his cloth? Did the director edit it when he passes by the tree?",
