0,30 March 2005,claudio_carvalho,10," A Perfect Chemistry, In One of the Most Beautiful Romances I Have Ever Seen","While traveling by train through Europe, the American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and the French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet each other and decide to spend the night together in Austria. On the next morning, Jesse returns to United States of America, and Celine to Paris. ",/
1,11 February 2005,The_Void,9, Casablanca for the 1990's - pure cinematic gold,"Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation. Richard Linklater's romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people. The film depicts romance in all it's glory, but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples; and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that's as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to - with just one problem, the problem of time. While most relationships wind down with time, this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out. Before Sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental 'Hollywood romance', which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders. The story follows two people, Jesse; an American and Celine; a French girl that meet on a train into Vienna. They instantly connect, and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train, Jesse asks Celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of Vienna...",r

3,14 August 1998,Sickfrog,10, Love Still Exists.,"This has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy-meets-girl movies ever made. While ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""Say Anything"" deliver nice portrayals, this movies strips down useless subplots and Hollywood divergences. This movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance. You never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people. You almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it. This movie is mostly all dialogue -based. But, every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing. What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is. How in all that conversation, while often having no real bearing on anything critical, you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other. This is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone. And what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe. This could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random. And what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of Vienna in which this film takes place. It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests. And no matter how many times I watch this film, I don't think I will ever tire of that.",v
4,8 February 2001,zetes,10, One of the best films of the 1990s,"I had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago, but its concept interested me when I heard it: an American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and they spend the night together talking. It sparked my interest, but I never expected it to be this great. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece, and it's also one of the most romantic films on record. To my surprise, it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s. It's impossible to really talk too much about it, since there is no real plot, so to speak (although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about; it is sort of like My Dinner With Andre, where there is a conversation, but it's not JUST the conversation that matters), but let me just say, see it. SEE IT!",i
5,25 April 2004,Superunknovvn,10, Wonderful love story,"""Before Sunrise"" is a wonderful love story and has to be among my Top 5 favorite movies ever. Dialog and acting are great. I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, the romantic Vienna, introduced in the movie does not exist (you won't find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night) and it isn't possible to get to all the places in only one night, either (especially if you're a stranger and it's your first night in Vienna). But that's not the point. The relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic. Although, nothing ever really happens, the movie never gets boring. The ending is genuinely sad without being ""Titanic"" or something. Even if you don't like love stories you should watch this film! I'm a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer. The first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.",e
6,19 August 2007,Galina_movie_fan,9," ""Isn't everything we do in life a way to be loved a little more?""","Sweet and charming, funny and poignant, plot less but meaningful, ""Before Sunrise"" (1995), the third movie of Richard Linklater, is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love, is in love, or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it. It is one of the very rare movies that is/should/will be equally interesting to teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car chases, or long and steamy sex scenes. Two young people in their early 20s, two college students (American tourist Ethan Hawke who is returning home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend the classes in Sorbonne) meet on a train. They are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking, they hop off the train in Vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, that's the movie. It could've been boring and silly but instead, it is a lovely, believable, clever, and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing (at least, for this viewer). High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is. Julie Delpy, who looks like a Botticelli's angel, is great in portraying smart, independent, and incredibly attractive young woman.",w
7,16 October 2003,whpratt1,10, EXTREMELY DEEP & WONDERFUL LOVE STORY !,"It was by accident that I was scanning the TV channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other.   Ethan Hawke (Jesse) ""Tape"" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) ""ER"" 94 TV Series (Nicole).  This gal and guy, will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years.  Jesse and Celine have great conversation, and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them.  I am looking forward to the SEQUEL to this film in 2004 and if you have viewed this film, you will feel the same way.",/
8,22 June 2013,Arcturus1980,10, An enthralling romance,"I discovered this film soon after its video release on a movie channel one early morning in my mid-teens. More of an action or comedy or action comedy type movie fan at that time, Before Sunrise planted the seeds of my incurable romanticism. My every viewing reaffirms a naturalistic charm that has not and will not wane. I do not go for naturalism invariably. For instance, John Cassavetes' A Woman Under the Influence. No thank you. Not my scene. But my what refreshing naturalism in this trilogy, even when to the point of awkwardness. A very big thanks to Richard Linklater for fleshing out this absolute gem of a film. Very wise of him too to co-write it with a woman, Kim Krizan. Though uncredited, it is worth noting that Delpy and Hawke each had a hand in rewriting this film with Linklater.",r
9,24 June 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," Essentially, it's a hundred-minute conversation; it's loose and meandering but fairly enjoyable.","'Before Sunrise (1995)' essentially has no plot and, though that's the point as the intention is to be a romance with all the extraneous 'Hollywood' elements removed, this leads to an experience that feels loose, aimless and meandering. It's experimental and laid-back by design but isn't the most gripping of narrative pieces because of it. It certainly feels less a character-study of its two leads and more a vehicle for Linklater, Krizan, Delpy and Hawke (the latter two of whom contributed heavily to the script uncredited) to express some of their most unique of ideas. These come constantly, seeming like stories they've told to friends or theories they have about life, love and religion, and, while they can be interesting (genuinely thought-provoking in cases), they don't really develop the characters and seem sort of out of place within the story. It's difficult to explain why most of that stuff doesn't seem to work, but it just doesn't feel fully genuine in most cases. It doesn't feel like it comes from the characters or express their budding romance, though this sort of talk certainly forms the basis for most relationships. Still, it isn't all unsuccessful. There is certainly some charm to the picture, once it picks up steam. In the end, the experiment seems to have worked. It was creatively refreshing for all involved and evokes memories of wandering around a holiday destination talking about nothing for hours. There's even some impressive long takes and the 'unscripted' feel is admirable considering it was all scripted down to the letter. This all leads to a sort of inane, carefree and somewhat nostalgic - if limited - enjoyment of a hundred-minute conversation told with cinematic language. 6/10.",w
10,27 February 2007,Fpi,9, One of those few movies that actually - ACTUALLY - feel like real life,"This movie is intelligent. That is, more than most other movies, it transcends the least common denominator - stupid people will probably not appreciate it. The story also relies heavily on dialogue. It has some parallels to Lost in Translation, although Before Sunrise is much brighter, somehow less abstract, and simply a lot better.",6
11,19 March 2007,Quinoa1984,10," the kind of conversations we all have in reality, yet projected here in a purely cinematic fold","Before Sunrise has many remarkable things going on, almost too many to fit into one review like this, but it's suffice to say that it's one of the most observant character studies of the nineties, maybe even in all of contemporary cinema, to be observant not about love, per-say, so much as it's about a human connection. How does one fall in love at first sight? No one does, at least that's deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film. And *yet* there is the possibility of as intense a connection, of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time. Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie, a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna, and on the way there start to talking about things, at first arbitrary, then personal (Jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather). Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town', in Vienna, until his plane the next morning.",8
12,12 August 2013,kosmasp,8, Beginning,"Who'd have thunk back then, that this would spawn a trilogy? My guess is nobody. But the first movie was strong enough to have followers and believers in it. Apart from the setting and the two magnificent actors, we get treated to some wonderful dialog. Some great scenery as well and the one subject that rules most of our lives -> Love.",2
13,1 March 2006,rooprect,3, Annoying frat boy hits on French girl. For 12 hours.,Annoying frat boy hits on French girl. For 12 hours. But the worst part is that the French girl goes along with it. For 12 hours. And we are forced to go along with it. For 2 hours. This is the kind of movie that makes you want to smack someone.,1
14,17 February 2005,olafra,10, one of my favorite movies,"I want Céline and Jessie go further in their relationship, I want to tell them that they were made for each other, that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other. Their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached. This is about love but not stupid things like in ""notting hills"" or those kind of movie. This is life and i did believe in them, i did believe they were falling... This was so clever and touching. I have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible again.",7
15,30 June 2019,Keemshave,10, Beautiful.,"It'll blow you away with its realism. This film presents the awkward, spontaneous, and genuine moments that real relationships have. It felt as if was watching two real people fall in love. Loved every minute of it...the philosophical conversations fascinated me. 1000% my favorite romance movie of all time because of its realism. This is a truly fantastical film that inspires you to find love.",9
16,12 June 2018,daoldiges,6, BEFORE Sunrise Please,"I'd both read and heard some really positive reviews of Before Sunrise and was looking forward to it. In large part I also feel there are some special elements to this film - the idea of meeting and being captivated by a stranger on a train and spending one magical, impactful night together, some really thoughtful and interesting dialogue, and an honesty of expression between the two main characters, all good and appreciated. However, I do have one major issue with this film, that it didn't know when to end. Unlike the two lead characters who at the films conclusion know not to force anything or attempt to take things too far, the director unfortunately extend things beyond their natural reaches to the film detriment. I sincerely think that with some prudent editing down this film could have been much stronger. I'm happy for those reviewers that were touched by this film and hold it in such high regard, sadly I am not one of them.",9
17,25 July 2012,benegesserit20,4, The most overrated movie I've ever seen,"Before anyone could accuse me of not liking this film because I'm not romantic let me tell you that I love romance. The more disgusting it is the more I like it. I liked the basic idea of two strangers falling in love in a nice Vienna scenery. But even beautiful Vienna couldn't save this movie. Well, American guy and French girl meet on a Budapest-Paris train (I'm not sure if there ever was a direct Budapest-Paris train, but whatever, there are direct Budapest-Vienna trains and that's pretty much enough for us). The boy convinces the girl to get off the train with him in Vienna and spend the rest of the day with him. Sounds sweet, right? From now on the movie is nothing but talking and talking and talking. Which wouldn't exactly be bad but in 9 scenes out of 10 they are talking so many deep-wannabe nonsense that made me have a slight nausea from about the 15th minute. I would have loved this movie much better with some likable, not-so-smart-ass characters. Maybe I will give a try to the sequel Before Sunset (God save me it's also an 8, I hope it's a much deserved 8). But before that I need some time to recover.",/

19,1 August 2005,Shaolin_Apu,10, Frame of Casablanca (1942)'s Love Story,"There are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime, but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives. These once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don't meet these people anymore. We don't always even know their names, as we are never presented to each other, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are. It's funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such, because reuniting might spoil fond memories, or we don't know do they. We are too afraid to check that out.",r

21,16 May 2001,Pro Jury,1, Gag them with a spoon,"One of the most difficult scenes in acting is when a fictitious character is to naturally recount an old memory.  Often in dramatics, an actor tells of some old memory with just a hint of averted eyes and awkward facial expressions.  It is difficult to act out the natural timing of facial expressions as a person taps their own memory.  In real life, we all do this with ease with our true memories.  But actors in a movie are dealing with make-believe, so there is nothing in their brains to be retrieved and it is very easy to see through the acting.",f

25,30 September 2022,owenpont-70803,10, Best chemistry in a film ever........,"I have never seen a more realistic depiction of romance in a film in my life. None of the characters have any cringe inducing dialog and they are both highly likeable. Everything about the film works. First off the writing is mesmerizing, every scene of the film works beautifully and most of it is because of the writing making every conversation feel real not staged. The setting in the film is of course neat. And the acting is fantastic. Both actors did flawless making every reaction and the energy in the film feel exactly how I would imagine it feeling like. Overall this is a beautifully crafted film that should be watched by everyone. It is the best of the trilogy which you should watch because the trilogy is also incredible as well.",t
26,21 September 2018,cricketbat,6, An interesting experiment in film,"Before Sunrise is an interesting experiment in film. The whole movie hangs on the dialogue and the chemistry between the two leads. There isn't much to the story -- it's all about the conversation. It works, but it's not a film that I would watch over and over again. I'm glad I watched it, though, and I'm interested in seeing the sequels, as well.",_

28,19 July 2005,magicrevolver,4, Absolutely tedious,"It seems I am in the minority here but I found this movie over-calmingly tedious. It's starts well, the meeting on the train and the intriguing possibility of what may happen when two strangers meet by chance is alluring but once they start wandering around Vienna it's when it starts to get boring. The dialogue is just the kind of naive, wistful, cod-philosophical nonsense that young couples on their first date come up with to impress the other partner. Fine if you are trying to get laid but it makes for rather irritating viewing. After a while I was more interested in the scenery than what was going on with the main characters. By the end I just wished they'd shut up and get on the damn train! It's not that I don't have a romantic streak or appreciate dialogue based movies, there are many good examples of this type of film, it's just that I expect not to almost fall asleep during it.",r
29,10 January 2005,naosGRL,10, still cuts deep after 10 years,"i watched this movie 10 years ago. and have watched it on video an average of once a year since. it's the type of movie that's timeless, because the themes are universal, yet the stories and conversation are so personal. it's also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll, despite the fact that there are, really, just two (very involving) characters. this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy, who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine. this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality TV, and now, the phenomenon is rampant! i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space, and makes you think, however jaded you may be, that you are one of those characters. it also made me want to ride the train around Europe! i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie. maybe that speaks about myself, my friends, or just the sheer genius of this movie.",v
30,22 July 2005,furex,1, Adverse selection,"Pick a french girl, put her on a random travel, say a train from Budapest to Paris. But wait -- she's not your average french girl, after all, because she can speak PERFECTLY English. That's pretty uncommon for a country where the use of foreign languages is officially forbidden, but you don't want to be too picky, right? This is a movie after all! Now pick your average American boy, coming to Old Europe to meet his girlfriend -- but she is a really average girlfriend, one that comes to Old Europe for some kind of art study (we are allowed to think that this is not the real reason, or that art studies are useless - you choose); however, she is pretty average, so she ended up cheating on him and when he arrives, he soon realizes he's going to be dumped.",

From there the two spend the entire day and night together getting to know one another and falling in love.  Before Sunrise is a beautiful and romantic tale of two strangers who fall in love, but must part after only one night together. The flick has plenty of talk, but is never a bore.  Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are great in the leads, its hard not to love this flick or the stars.  A great date flick and a romance that even touched the heart of a hard core horror fan such as myself.  Check it out!",

33,12 June 2020,ArmandoManuelPereira,7," It Possesses A Very Natural Feeling, Wonderfully Romantic, And Stylistically A Bit Off The Beaten Path","Very Natural feeling and wonderfully romantic. If you wonder whether a movie can sustain interest by merely showing two people having conversation, while walking around Vienna, then Before Sunrise might be your answer. I personally found it enjoyable. It is true its main characters spout a lot of youthful pretentiousness, but that is rather the point of the movie, I believe. Whatever else, Linklater can hardly be faulted for attempting something a little off the beaten path, stylistically speaking.",

Before Sunrise is what you get when you strip away all of the flash, all the flare, and all the cluttering visual elements of a story and instead simply turn on the camera and allow two actors to be together and tell a story completely driven by poignant dialogue.

Jesse, an American traveling Europe for his own vague reasons, meets Celine, a French girl, on a train on the way to Vienna.

The primary reason to see ""Before Sunrise,"" is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines. As ""Celine,"" this sexy, brainy, soulful brown-eyed blond is sort of a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Joni Mitchell as they were in their mid-twenties. Risking overstatement, Celine is practically the ideal woman, unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural, unpretentious, introspective, and selflessly loving. We can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak, for her sincere, intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating. Further, her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks English with a French accent that is very endearing. ",

But epic romances a la Gone with the Wind are basically, um, gone with the wind. That is, before Richard Linklater came along. I'm not calling his Before Sunrise an epic romance by any means, but it's a nice, small romance that actually has believable characters in a believable circumstance. You can't really get that from a recent ""romance"". What Linklater (and co-writer Kim Krizan) create is an engaging love story that, unfortunately, has never heard of ""too much of a good thing"".",
44,21 February 2013,Nestorio_Miklos,1, Omg! Shut!!! Up!!! already,"too much of the talking. I don't understand why this movie is getting such a high ratings. I have read all the good previews on this piece of rubbish that I was eager to see it, so I rent the DVD and put it on one evening and let me tell you after five minutes (ok, sorry maybe ten) i was only forcing myself throughout the movie to finish the watching. I mean the pseudo intelligent American boy just could not shut his mouth all over the movie together with a french girl speaking English who could not shut it up either. The conversation after while was getting so boring that only good thing was the sightseeing of Vienna. They both tried so hard to be deep that it was actually shallow and unreal.

45,6 August 2014,Seraphion,8, One of the best romance movies I've seen so far,"The story rolls out the big coincidence thing at the very beginning to develop into something cute. The togetherness depicted in the movie is maybe representative of the kind that many people crave. The kind that is less or even free of having to bind together into a commitment. I like the thing about this movie that the very attraction of the romance depicted in this movie is the conversations, of how thoughtful they are. They don't have to be all in agreement all the time, but they can be resolved in recognition of the different perspectives if thinking. I like how Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy acted out here. They seem to connect nicely. Their performance can depict the needed amount of connection considering the sheer coincidence and serendipity involved in the togetherness.",

47,22 May 2002,domenicarose,8, Very charming film... please be patient with it!,"When I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1995 via a free advanced screening, I was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it. I was sorry when I talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended. I, on the other hand, felt completely the opposite. I was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else. People I talked to said there was too much talking! Plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters. I found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the American movie-going public seems to have a tendency to want easy-to-follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused. They also like to be spoon-fed tidy endings--happy OR sad. This disgusts me. Nobody wants to be challenged anymore??? And as for the ending (and I don't want to be a spoiler), I am totally content because I know in my heart  that these two characters WILL see each other again. It's all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny. It's a very personal film that doesn't speak to all people. But it certainly spoke to me. Give it a chance! Be patient with it! Richard Linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of Vienna. Watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters. As if you yourself were tripping through Europe on a Eurail pass. It's very intimate. Plus, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life. They must have improvised during some parts and it works well. They have a great chemistry in their roles. Their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses. I get the feeling that this was a very personal work for Mr. Linklater and I deeply respect him for getting this film made. It definitely touched me and I hope it touches others just as much. Bravo for romance!!!",

Jesse and Celine would be connected on Facebook and FaceTiming as they ride their respective trains, and so there would be no sense of enigma or mystery and burgeoning desire. Lucky are those who got to meet and think of people this way... with no devices. The movie quite convincingly portrays such connection between two young people who just met, thanks to the deep dialogue and the acting performances. I wonder if we can even find 23-year olds today who can converse with surprisingly wise insights instead of just taking selfies all day.",
51,2 November 2020,nasrinriyaz,10, One of my favourite romantic movies,"I cannot bilieve how a movie could convey so many emotions. The beauty of the movie is that, its not like any other love stories made just for entertainment. This one sinks deep in.
It is absolutely wonderful how they made us watch the entire movie where two people talk about their life and their thoughts about stuff. And talking about the thoughts, they are really amazing. We just get the idea that they are made for each other. Not every people find these thoughts interesting. The scenes they captured are simply amazing. The one inside the listening booth, the one where they talk as their friends, the one where jesse says how she changed him to somebody else (he added 'usualy drugs and alcohol do that'), the one where she says its like a fairytale and how they turn to pumpkins in the morning. It is a must watch movie,Thought provoking. The scenes they shot it the daylight, the places empty without them meant a lot. Conveyed so many messages.
Even though the ending is sad, it also made us peaceful ..I mean that's rare.",
52,2 December 2011,axlrhodes,9, Irresistibly romantic.,"What a breath of fresh air. Watching this film makes me wonder why i put myself through watching so many empty, soulless blockbusters. Watching Before Sunrise is a great experience. You feel for the characters, you understand their awkwardness,their joy and their discovery. It's so familiar to so many of us, you also feel their pain and their melancholy toward the end and ultimately, its irresistibly romantic. From a story or narrative point of view, there is nothing, this is all about the human beings in the film and it's all the better for it. Credit must go to Richard Linkater for his unfussy direction, that just allows to film to breathe,unwind and gradually stretch it's legs. I loved Before Sunrise, and i can't wait to catch up with the characters nine years later in the 2004 sequel, Before Sunset.",
53,20 December 2015,MarcHannigan,10, A romantic masterpiece,"Before Sunrise is for sure one of the most important romances in the history of film. The Richard Linklater movie not only surpasses the expectation of its cheesy poster, the cliché tag line or the absurd simplicity of its premise (""A young man and woman meet on a train in Europe, and wind up spending one evening together in Vienna"", on IMDb), but actually does something remarkable: makes the audience believe in those people. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy star, and their performances make Jesse and Celine two of the most fleshed-out, three dimensional characters I've ever seen on film. Nowadays, we are used to the Nicholas Sparks formula, in which characters are defined only by one or two particular traits in their personality, and the way they act and speak and show their feelings is clearly dictated by the story. In Before Sunrise, the characters are the story and for that, they dictate the shortcomings of it, which makes for a much more pleasant watching experience, and one that feels a lot more genuine. Even the most ""movie moments"", like when the couple first meet on the train and Jesse asks Celine if she wants to join him on a tour across the Austrian city, are handled with a superb sincerity and spontaneity thanks to Linklater's minimal character-driven direction, Hawke' and Delpy's excellent performances and their chemistry with one another, which honestly made me think they were married in real life, and, of course, the magnificent screenplay by Kim Krizan and Linklater himself, that basically turns this run-of- the-mill romance into one masterpiece, taking its simple premise and turning it on its head, and just making something beautiful, something full of heart and, most of all, something unique.",

It far surpasses the follow-ups in the Linklater 'trilogy' which I found pretty underwhelming. I guess both actors are younger here (significantly), and while both are annoying in their own way, there's a real spontaneity and authenticity about their flirtation. Hawke is basically dodgy and untrustworthy; Delpy is vain and flighty, yet their conversations are a delight, possibly because they remind us all of our student days when we'd talk late into the evening about life, the universe and everything. And thus the reason so many return to this film every ten years or so is because it makes us feel young again; it probably even brings a tear to our rheumy eyes...",

It is so brutally honest!! I loved every bit of it, from the start to the very end, frozen to my couch. It is so intense and engaging. Linklater takes us continuously through a 105 minute journey with those two awesome characters without a flicker of boredom or monotony. He uses very trivial dialogues that are quite common to intelligent conversations of post-modernist societies, but installs a sweet romanticism within each scene. I am really at a loss to understand as to why he was not given the best Director award in that year. The movie commands an absolute smooth rhythm, flows effortless and renders serenity at its best.

Julie Delpy turns in one of the decade's most engaging performances as the Parisian lass who spends a day with stranger-on-a-train Ethan Hawke.  The dialogue (and there is oodles of it) is sometimes meandering and overly precious, but this portrait of two young wannabe-lovers making a romantic, intellectual, and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing, touching and insightful moments.",

I almost never give up on movies in that manner, but I found this one the opposite of what I thought it was going to be, which was intensely romantic and poignant. Instead of charming and wistful, the characters came over as jaded and pretentious. The looks exchanged by the two leads in the listening room felt contrived, and their first kiss was not built-up-to with any kind of real tension.",
61,19 August 2010,magoofire,5, A lame movie ugh!,I have watched this movie about 4 days ago. I am already forgetting a lot of what happens in the movie. In four weeks I will probably forget huge parts of the movie and in four months my only memory will be of Ethan Hawke's terrible performance. We are introduced to Ethan sporting some bad facial hair. So he meets this attractive girl and starts talking to her. He somehow manages to convince her to get off with him in Vienna. This came as a huge surprise for me due to the fact he plays a character that has the social skills of an ape! He tells her of his idea of watching a person for 24 hours on some cable TV programme. I think at this point Ethan is more of a Hannibal Lecter than Humphrey Bogart. So my theory of him being crazy was a little off but later on through the movie my theory of him being an annoying human being was spot on. So the film is trying to be artsy and romantic but it misses by a long way. We go through the motions of a couple who go on a 1st date and who have a great time. Constantly waiting for something exciting to happen but alas poor Ethan doesn't even get laid in the end. They don't exchange numbers and finally agree to meet in 6 months at the train station. So we are left wondering but not caring what would happen. So if there was genuine fans of this movie to would have to wait just 9 years to see the sequel. I'm on the edge of my seat!!!! Anyways they should have got each others emails and g chatted I hear its great fun!!! ;-),

You feel compelled to share personal information with this stranger, deep thoughts that no one other than you have pondered or heard, and talk until your throat is raw about everything you can think of in that given moment. Your become verbally diuretic, and after it's over, you're upset that the conversation has ended, but you've achieved a state of personal tranquility thanks to a release of all that was on your mind that you are at a sort of bliss. It's a strange thing to articulate, and those who have had that kind of connection know precisely what I'm talking about.

But overall, this is a film where two young people talk to each other all day (or ninety minutes from the viewer's perspective).

Whenever Linklater switches to body language (the looks between the couple in the music booth) and purely visual shots (the morning scenes without actors) one begins to feel the deeper emotions that would be present in the given situation. But these moments are way too few and they are drowned in the veritable deluge of ""adolescent"" conversation between the two main characters.

In excellent quality blazing it's own path, the movie sticks with a real and believable outcome.

But he does edge closer in the tram, and fiddle with his hands and jacket, and in one little perfect moment, go to brush away a strand of her hair almost nonchalantly, but quickly pull out of it as she turns to him. At one point, he scoffs at the idea of such a chance meeting, of everyone always putting big romantic projections onto encounters, but changes his mind when he does this himself.

She wanted to have one of those romantic evening for two in Vienna, and I caught from her character that anyone with half-a-brain would do well for the adventure. That person, in this case, happened to be Ethan Hawke. So, they attempt to have these moments, forcibly interrupted by Hawke trying to throw a kiss in there every once in awhile that wasn't scripted (to seem more ""real"") that only made Delpy seem disgusted.

Only attractive point might be beautiful scenes from Vienna but this is even not good enough to give a reasonable rate to this movie.",

I was really intrigued as many friends, particularly female, described it as an outstanding work of art. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood or my expectations were too high but I didn't experience the movie as really exceptional. It's approach is the typical French style of never-ending philosophical comments on life in general but stripped of profound thinking and based on the concept of ""badinage"" which basically boils down to ""just talking"". Charming indeed but not unfamiliar to Europeans who at times have been saturated with ""talk movies"" (e.g. Bertrand Tavernier's ""Un dimanche à la campagne"", Eric Rohmer's ""Ma nuit chez Maud"" etc.) It is often interesting indeed to hear how people reflect on the meaning of life and how they, in their quest for honesty, are often obliged to contradict their own relative insights as the game offers no certitudes: it was Nietzsche who stated that facts do not exist (this is certainly true for human interaction), only interpretations.""Before Sunrise"", however, although a very sweet movie does not dig very deep and the conversations therefore have that artificial flavor which is characteristic of so many French productions. Great acting, some memorable scenes and to me a very ""nice"" movie which I constantly watched with a feeling of ""I have have seen and heard all this .. many times before"" I am convinced however that the movie will undoubtedly appeal to most people who are still in their twenties or thirties.",

Before sunrise is the opposite of this. It is founded on a simple plot and premise, of two people who have connected emotionally on a train exploring the city of Vienna. Much of the dialogue involves them walking and talking about everything under the sun(or stars), and it is absolutely enthralling and captivating. The locales in this film are superb, with Vienna and its unique characters offering more than just a pretty backdrop, and actually revealing character traits of Jesse and Celine.(Jesse is cynical, Celine an idealist). Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy also offer superlative performances here, their acting and dialogue delivering a realism that is sorely lacking in most films today.(case in point, the kiss on the Prater Ferris wheel, or them stealing glances at each other at the Vinyl record store) Before Sunrise is not a film that will make you cry, but it is the sort of film that will be stuck in your head weeks after you have seen it.",

125,25 May 2015,vishaal811,10, A Minimalistic Masterpiece,I am amazed by this movie. That is surprising considering the fact that there is not much that occurs in this movie apart from talking. Before Sunrise is a romantic movie in which two people meet in a train and decide to spend a day together despite the fact that they just met and are unlikely to see each other ever again. The performances from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is real and not exaggerated like we see in a lot of movies. The entire film seems like it is taken from our lives and we can totally relate to the characters and the circumstances that they are in. The movie is filled with wonderful ideas about life and the meaning of it. Richard Linklater must be praised for making a movie like this and I would love to see movies that are similar. A good screenplay is the cornerstone of any great movie and Before Sunrise is no exception. An interesting aspect of this movie is that the entire film takes place in a 24-hour time span. This movie must be seen if you like sensible movies and a realistic story.,
126,14 July 2022,ademyucell,10, Actually I rated this 8,"So simple, yet so powerful... Yes, it's what it is. The realism is strong with the feeling of being on a journey. Who didn't go on a journey before? To make money, to get education, to holiday or just because of boredom. Everyone makes a journey. Mixture of fear, excitement, anxiety and awe of unknown, remember that feeling? At some point, we're on a journey in this world. This movie creates a connection (willingly or unwillingly) to this very emotion with a very simple trick and there you go. By close up before and afterwards to streets and places characters visit, cinematography reminds you places you go will continue to exist after you long gone. It feels like as if I am watching the places I've never returned and been only once from a CCTV or something. Then, you will suddenly feel like both a tourist who witnessed two people's love story, and seeing the vision of your never-ever-happened past as you really emphasize the happenings via extraordinary tool of journey. It's crazy but it works.",

Never does this wander into cliches, it sticks to its own pace and captures the magic between this couple. I have never felt so personally involved in a movie- when the sun rose I felt like crying. I was screaming, GET ON THE TRAIN JESSE!!! And yet it ends realistically, without fully satisfying the audience with the ""yay everything's perfect"" ending.

I have to admit that there are moments that feel very genuine, and it seems more realistic and heartfelt than most romance movies. The problem is that you have to hear these two people talk, and talk, and talk for an hour and forty-five minutes and neither of them has anything interesting to say. You get to hear Hawke's ideas about reincarnation and Delpy's story about going into therapy after breaking up from a boyfriend she didn't like that much anyway, and yadda, yadda, yadda, blah, blah, blah . . .

Before Sunset is life, it is experience. Anyone that has ever met someone they ""kind of like"" and wanted to find out more about them will know what this film is about. This is missed opportunity, this is chance, this is the roll of the dice and the one that got away.

141,27 August 2004,writers_reign,10," Goodnight, Vienna","There is, in England, a venerable joke based on the schmaltzy musical show, 'Goodnight, Vienna' that was a mega hit way back in the twenties/thirties. After cleaning up in the West End the producer put out several Road companies and anxious to see how they were doing he visited each theatre in turn. Arriving in Stockton he made his way to the theatre and asked the manager how the show was doing. 'About as well as ""Goodnight, Stockton"" would do in Vienna', came the answer. I find that that story can be adapted to accommodate this terrific movie. Ask one of the Godard pseuds how this movie would do at the LSE and the answer would be about as well as Breathless at a Fred Astaire retrospective. I saw this film on its initial release and marvelled at its lack of pretension and the way it delivered PURE entertainment. Because of a self-imposed rule (I have seen, like most people who visit this site, literally thousands of movies but I won't rely on my memory alone so I wait til I see them again on TV or at a festival or they become available on DVD before posting a comment) I was unable to comment at the time but now, in its wisdom and probably not least because Before Sunset is doing so well, a cinema in London has seen fit to screen Before Sunrise and so I was able to see it again and make the happy discovery that is is just as good as I remember. One of the most impressive things about it is the fact that it is shot in very long takes so that, by definition, the actors have been obliged to learn large chunks of dialogue as opposed to the average film where they may need to learn a couple of sentences at most. Ethan Hawke and the gorgeous Julie Delpy are totally relaxed with each other and give the impression that they're just winging it, saying whatever comes into their heads and occasionally it does sound gauche but mostly it hits exactly the right note. This is a very 'continental' film inasmuch as virtually nothing happens, there are no computer graphics, no sex, no violence, no severed limbs, no peurile jokes, just two people clearly attracted to each other and slowly falling in love as we stop just short of feeling voyeuristic. Impossible to praise too highly and wonder of wonders, the sequel, nine years down the line is just as wonderful. 10/10",

That said you must be warned, Before Sunrise is what I label a 'hit or miss' movie (no, not in the rhyming slang sense, tsk), in that the impact of the film will depend largely on the viewer, you will either love it or hate it. Also in the film not a lot happens, there is no real drama, conflict or action just 2 people who meet share a day together in Vienna and fall in love. It is a 'talky' film, it almost all dialogue, the dialogue will not always be easy to digest for everyone, I found the film to drag at points, but there are at least some things in here that I think everyone can relate to. What makes the film a success (to some, not all) is the way that this relationship unfolds, with sublime realism and tenderness.

162,27 July 2005,riderpridethemovie,10, We are all stardust,"Everyone I've asked has maintained the sequel to Before Sunrise is superior. I disagree. Perhaps they related to Jesse and Celine later in their lives, or maybe they just prefer Paris to Vienna. In baseball, however, when the ball and the runner reach the base at the same time, the tie goes to the runner. In the case of originals and sequels, ceteras para bus, the tie should go to the original: without it, there would be no sequel. The characters, the tone and the structure were developed in Sunrise first. I suppose this is the place where I would review the film, but it seems unfair to divulge any of the lovely secrets embedded in almost each scene, lest the reader hasn't seen the film. You really ought to discover these things on your own. But for what they are  well-plotted, exceptionally well-written conversations perfectly synthesized by the actors and shot in a glorious cinematic style  these films are perfect. Frost once wrote that great art came from freedom within the reins. Linklater adheres to this, allowing his premise to guide him. THe result is his films never try to be too much, yet they build tension like no Michael Bay film.",

Before Sunrise is one of those films. I don't know what I found so beautiful about two people falling in love and talking to each other the whole movie (mostly Ethan Hawke). But that's the beauty of this movie, the minimalism approach to it. It proves that with the proper directorship and a natural cast, you can make thriller and horror fanatics stare at the screens for an hour and 45 minutes of romantic drama. Hawke and Delpy's acting was so natural. The little emotions that people throw out during a real life conversation, I never saw those in any movie except this one.",

180,5 November 2000,dxs253,10, A short poetic love story of strangers,Two wonderful actors - Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy - play young students who meet on a train in Europe and decide to get off at Vienna to spend the next 24 hours together. This is basically a road film but it develops like a one of those garden variety 24-hour real-life documentary. It could have been a cliche love story. Instead it brings out the culmination of subtlety and inspirational love story largely thanks to great plot and outstanding selection of actors. The film is depicting a process of two young people with different backgrounds gradually understanding and falling for each other: Ethan Hawke as a bit self-absorbed American student visiting a possible girlfriend in Spain only to leave broken-hearted and Julie Delpy as a  French student with rather political point of view on world affair - she resents the situation in former Yugo-slavia in the early scene. The two get closer as they walk through streets of Vienna encountering kind strangers in the city.,

191,18 August 2020,lilbuch22,10, A Realistic Film,"For me when I watch a film I want something that has depth, a message, a gripping climax, a great ending, colorful characters, and sweeping dialogue. This film had that, and something that a lot of films especially romance ones today don't have, charm. I really felt compelled into both of the characters because not only were they super charismatic but they were real. They had feelings, and they cracked jokes and made fun of one another. They bonded over stories, talking about their interests, what makes them get up in the morning and experience life. These are real conversations that I wish we had more of today. Nowadays the dating world is so tough and everyone is moving a mile a minute and one of the key themes in this film I think is to stop and smell the roses. Life is going on right in front of you. Another way it felt so realistic was the super long takes and some editing tricks to help it look like almost one continuous shot. It was almost as if we were facing the characters and experiencing their love begin to bud as we were walking backwards witnessing it. This film moved me and made me tear up.

His film could be described as a post-slacker romance with heart as two twenty-somethings meet on a train headed for Vienna, and develop an instant attraction and rapport, so much so that both decide to spend the next day together in Vienna until sunrise marks their departure. French actress Julie Delpy, best known for her contribution to Three Colours White, plays Celine, a Sorbonne student; while Ethan Hawke plays Jesse, an American who has just split with his girlfriend in Spain and decides to euro-rail his way back to some sense of normality. What follows is a delightful use of off-the-wall dialog and picturesque locations, but rather than show us the tourist Vienna, Linklater opts for less-likely haunts: an eerie cemetery for unknown people; small side streets; slightly seedy bars. Along the way both meet a a variety of Slacker-like types, from a theatrical duo with a wry sense of humor to a Viennese poet-in-demand. Such exchanges feel like Linklater's insistence on brining the arbitrary exchanges of Slacker to his first romantic feature and although the scenes have an eccentric edge, some feel forced and contrived as if Linklater was too fond of Slacker to let its influence wane in this work.",

Basically on a train from Budapest travelling through Europe, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is a young American man going to Vienna to catch a flight back to the United States, and Céline (Broken Flowers' Julie Delpy) is a young French woman heading back to University in Paris having been to visit her grandmother. When she moves seats he notices her and moves himself, they slowly introduce themselves and start a really flowing conversation, until the train journey reaches Jesse's destination, but he thinks because they are getting on so well that he suggests she should join him for one day, mentioning the thought of unhappy marriage. As Jesse does not have much money he and Céline decide to roam the streets of Venice, filled with many landmarks and beautiful sights, fun things to do and interesting people to meet along the way. Eventually they share a romantic kiss at the top of Riesenrad ferris wheel (just like Timothy Dalton as James Bond 007 did with Kara in The Living Daylights), and they are able to open up much more about their opinions and thoughts about the city, relationships, love, marriage, religion, the differences between men and women, and even sex. Céline reveals that she did have a boyfriend, but they broke up after six months because she felt she was getting too close for comfort or whatever, and Jesse says that he was in fact on his way to a girlfriend who was with him in Madrid, but they broke up too because she was avoiding him. Continuing to walk around Venice they approached by and watch a few people who give them services or entertainment and they pay for them, these include an eccentric Palm Reader (Erni Mangold) who gives them vague predictions, and along the canal Street Poet (Dominik Castell) who asks them for a word to include in a poem that he quickly writes for them, they chose the word ""milkshake"", and he reads his poem Delusion Angel (written by David Jewell) to them which they are happy with. It has been dark in the city for a while, and Jesse and Céline stop in a café to talk some more, and there they have fake phone call conversations, playing each other's friends, and doing this she reveals that she was going to get off the train anyway, and he reveals that he wanted an escape from his life in his travelling. They admit their feelings to each other, they are both attracted to one another, but they are sure they won't see each other when they will leave the next day, so they decide to make the most of the time they have left together, it is unsure whether they actually did anything but a sexual encounter is implied. The film ends when the next day they rush to the train station where Céline catches the train, but before Jesse leaves her they agree that they will meet again in the spot they are in six months' time to rekindle their love, and as both head for their destinations they reflect on their time together and obviously miss each other. Hawke and Delpy give exceptional and heart-warming performances as the strangers who meet, spend twenty four hours together as friends and by the end of it end up deeply in love with each other, the direction and writing and Linklater is really clever and witty that it makes a film where almost little goes on move at a great pace and is carried simply by words and expressions, it is a marvellous romantic drama.

It really is a romantic suspense film. You want them to be together but at the same time it sends a message to let yourself live in the moment and be happy with what is going on now, without trying to extend it. It's really a film you can think about and discuss for a long time. The exceptional dialog drives the film and you can tell the chemistry between the actors is something special or else it wouldn't work.

You feel alone even if you had a million people around you, Jesse was alone in his world even though he was surrounded by people. After meeting Celine his world has changed, his romantic self revealed even though he was wearing a cynic outfit. When you are with the right one your true self will reveal itself. Such a powerful message has passed to the viewers with a few scenes. When the movie come to it's ending note, it leaves a glimpse of hope for the characters as well as the viewers.

But wished I have saw this first, since it's the first movie in this ""Before"" trilogy. The story is about two people meeting and as they converse, they start to build a bond with each other. While also sightseeing and experience their time in Vienna for a evening. Again the conversations hit the mark, although this time it goes in a basic root direction. It's still interesting and intriguing, even if your one of those audiences that actually thought about some of the topics in the conversation. I am not quite sure how much is ad-lib or improvised but the direction is believable and realistic. Maybe it's because both the actor and actress put few of their own real life in put, such as how Ethan Hawke is really born and raised in Texas. The conversations is basically pseudo-intellectual and philosophical view points and questions. The chemistry and connection between the two lead characters is strong. This time Ethan Hawke's character Jesse is the pessimist and slightly not as likable. While the lead actress is a optimist and likable for this first installment. The dialogues or conversations touches upon life, death, religions, relationships, and love. So although it touches on the basics, it's still a immersive film. And I enjoyed it, maybe for it's realism and thought provoking effects. Even if some areas I could agree with while others not so much.",

239,24 February 2006,DaveFromAfar,10, Great,"Along with one other film, this film and its sequel have moved me more than any others. Many great comments have been posted here. I would add that repeated viewings of the film reveal to me that it's only Jesse who's ambivalent about turning the night into something lasting. He's from a divorce background and seems to want to keep an image of himself as a footloose kid. You can see it in the way he walks away jauntily and youthfully from the train station after they part. It's not so much a ""guy thing"" as personal psychology. Celine is from a happy home and has no ambivalence--she wants them to be together and stay together. It's almost too painful that they lose each other for nine years, and that Jesse comes back six months later but doesn't find her there. The film superbly uses imagery and music to evoke the deeply sacred nature of the love that they find. Yes it is ""romantic,"" but also realistic--sometimes people do meet who are wonderful matches for each other. In their youth and relative innocence and inexperience, they're swept into something mighty and profound. The film's exceptional blend of rapture and pain comes from the suspense of not knowing if they (Jesse) will be smart enough to make sure they hold onto this connection. Of course, this is what makes the ending of Sunset such an overpowering relief--at the very least they'll remain in touch and know where each other is. I think we're dealing here with rare works of art because of the balance and blending between the finest of detail on the surface and the deepest of profundity and poignancy in the background. After the predawn love in the park, we see the mundane, sun-drenched city, hear the harpsichord and the church bells, see them sitting at the base of the statue with her resting her head in his lap--all superb, beautiful, and exceptionally moving.",

It has very little real plot. The little plot it has revolves around two people who meet on a train going through Europe. They are Jesse and Celine. Jesse is an American who is not completely sure why he is traveling through Austria and plans to get of in Venice. Celine is a french woman who is on her way back to Paris for her college term. They talk for maybe an hour before they get to the stop at Venice and Jesse has to get off. He of course convinces her to come with them and because neither have very much money they just wander around talking until sunrise when they must part for ever. They of course fall in love, have sex, and plan to meet again but deep down know they won't. It is the usual cliché of a romance but somehow it works well. Mostly because of the wonderful dialogue and the performance by Ethan Hawke. The direction is also better than usual. Somehow it works very well, much better than it probably sounds. It is also very funny.",

246,18 September 2004,colonel_green,8, Young love.,"After seeing Richard Linklater's ""Before Sunset"", and loving every minute of it, I resolved to find the film that ""Sunset"" was a followup to: 1995's ""Before Sunset"". Both films star Ethan Hawke (""Dead Poets Society"") and Julie Delpy (""White"") as Jesse and Celine, two star-crossed lovers who have a penchant for engaging in long conversations on a wide variety of topics. In ""Sunrise"", Jesse and Celine meet while on a train to Vienna. Jesse is sightseeing in Europe, having been dumped by his girlfriend who he had originally intended to spend his vacation with. Celine is on her way back from a visit to her grandmother. Jesse is going to catch a plane in Vienna back to the United States, and convinces Celine to get off with him. The two wander around Vienna, talking, encountering the locals, and, of course, falling in love. The plot of ""Before Sunrise"" is minimalist; the film depends on the strength of the two lead actors, and the dialogue they are given. Fortunately, both are very strong. I prefer ""Sunset"" to ""Sunrise"", but both are excellent productions. I give ""Sunrise"" an 8, compared to the 10 I gave ""Sunset"".",

255,21 May 2016,Screen_Blitz,8, Very few romantic dramas come as original and moving as this,"As the years pass, filmmakers are running low on ideas for the romance genre faster than some may expect. Many films manage to spit evidence of this, take the film adaptations for Nicholas Sparks' novels for an example (though a few of them are okay). That is not to say the romance genre is dead. Every now and then, Hollywood manages to surprise us with some surprisingly riveting and original love tales such as 'The English Patient', 'Romeo + Juliet', 'There's Something About Mary', and James Cameron ever popular 'Titanic'. But most of time, filmmakers choose to follow down almost same formulaic route: a guy meets a girl, they fall in love, hit some obstacles that put their relationship to the test, and in the end they get back together, a formula that's grown tiresome long before we knew it. This romantic drama directed by Richard Linklater supplies an entirely original love story that completely devoid from the typical romantic clichés that have long plagued the genre. The film opens up with Jesse (played by Ethan Hawke), a young man in his late teens or early 20s on a train to heading back to Vienna (France) where he will be flying back to America at 9:30 the following morning. In escape of a bickering German couple, young woman named Celine (played by Julia Delpy) moves down the aisle where she and Jesse come face-to-face. After engaging in a heart-warming friendly conversation, Jesse convinces her to tour with him around the city of Vienna before he leaves for his flight in the morning which she agrees. Before we know, a heart-touching romance develops between the two in what is their only night together.",

The main characters, Jesse and Celine, share their thoughts and emotions with sincerity.  The film does a beautiful job of developing their characters and their relationship.  The fleeting nature of life (and the resulting preciousness of transitory moments) is an underlying theme throughout the film, and it is woven in through so many creative media including conversation, poetry, music, art, and cinematography. There is also an element of magic or spirituality running beneath the surface that shines brightest in (as Celine describes) the little space between these two young people.  I can't seem to get enough of this film, and it is sweet torture to wonder what happens next.  If you love it too please e-mail me and we can try to figure out why we appreciate it so intensely while some people find it unremarkable.",

As their day progresses their connection to each other deepens as does our connection with them. Before Sunrise is so special because we are not manipulated into connecting with them through tragedy, or violence, or sex.

'Before Sunrise' simply and elegantly demonstrates how the most fundamental passions of human emotion can envelope two complete strangers.

I guess it's like eavesdropping on a conversation, you know it's wrong but you just can't help it. I thought it was well made, using Vienna very well without becoming a kind of travelogue.

The chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is just breath taking, with the seemed to be improvised dialogue and the (seeming real at the time) sexual tension between the two characters just was honest in delivery.

It is mostly dialouge exchanged between the American boy and French girl who meet and decide to spend one day together.  They get to know eachother and discuss life, sex, relationships, etc.  I'd say it's a giant step forward for Richard Linklater, more mature than Dazed and Confused or especially Suburbia.

His last stop, where he is currently heading, is Vienna, from where he will catch a flight home tomorrow morning. Celine (Julie Delphy), a Parisienne, had been in Budapest visiting her grandmother. She is currently heading back to Paris to resume her studies at the Sorbonne. Jesse and Celine meet by chance on the same westbound train out of Budapest. The connection they feel from their short conversation on the train is enough for Jesse to suggest at the last minute that she get off the train with him in Vienna and that they spend time together in Vienna - just wandering around the city as was his original plan as he doesn't have the money for a hotel - before he needs to go to the airport, and at which time she will board the next train to Paris. If it ends up she feels uncomfortable with him as time progresses, she could ditch him at any point. Celine agrees. As they wander from place to place in Vienna, they talk about their philosophies of life and love. They also talk about logistical issues regarding their time, such as why Jesse was in Europe to begin with, what they are feeling for each other, if there is a future for them together and if so what that future may look like taking into consideration both their current lots in life.",

I didn't know of the movie's existence when it was in the movie houses in the mid-'90s, and I was ignorant of Ms. Delpy until I saw her in ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" in 1998. Like another poster, my last girlfriend somewhat/somehow resembled Ms. Delpy, and in the wake of that cataclysm, out of a veiled curiosity I began buying Julie's movies on ""eBay"". WOW! Not only was (is) she stunningly beautiful (and that sweet French-accented voice ... mon Dieu!), but she exuded a true depth of talent in the portrayal of her characters. Since ""Before Sunrise"" has now begotten ""Before Sunset"", my belief is that JD will now be looked at seriously for more parts in Hollywood, and perhaps a shot at a break-through major role. Still, I want her to continue to pick and choose her venues, her roles and her characters wisely. Bon chance, Julie! My fear is that in the current national (American) state of anti-French sentiment, her origin and accent might be seen as poison to casting agents and producers.

The story follows Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Céline (Julie Delpy), who, after meeting on a train bound for Vienna, decide to spend the day in the city before Jesse has to leave the next day for his home in America. What follows next is a wonderful connection between these two people who seem to be very interested in finding out personal details from each other.

316,26 June 2016,quinimdb,10, Before Sunrise,"""Before Sunrise"" is a film that is much, much better than it sounds on paper. It is mostly compromised of long takes of just these two characters, Jesse and Celine, who have just met on a train, talking. Just talking, about anything. Much of it on their various philosophies on life and about themselves. They are seemingly more honest to each other than to anyone else they know, such as in the fake phone call scene, and it shows in Ethan Hawke's and Julie Delpy's chemistry in this film, which is some of the best of any romance film ever. They both give fantastic performances, and they seem to completely inhabit their characters. It's possible that the film wouldn't work if it were any other two actors, and because they are so perfect for their roles, we end up believing every single word that they say, unlike many other romance films. This is a film that is very easy to get lost in, whether it's the fantastic and natural but revealing dialogue or the fantastic acting and chemistry between the leads or the long, long tracking shots in which the flow of the actors and their dialogue all come together so perfectly to pull us completely into their relationship. But we get so lost in the moment, as the characters do, that it's gone before we realize it, and we come to the harsh realization that their time together must come to an end for a long period of time. They say that they will meet on that exact day, six months from them, but we never really know. As we saw earlier they completely forgot about the play that they were asked to go to, and 6 months from now, sadly, who knows if they will remember to come? We also are hinted at the beginning of hard times to come when the film opens with an older foreign couple fighting and neither of the two main characters understand the language their speaking in, but it's also a metaphor for how they don't understand their struggles.

Actually everyone might cherish this kind of relationship as after over 20 years of independent life from each other, the couple is still able to understand each other and exchange other perspectives to each other without prejudice, which is quite of magic feeling. The couple talk about their religion, there views about the way people live in, their unique memory of adolescent period instead of talking about gossip. It seems like they can talk for days without interruption, and silence turns into romantic scene rather than awkward. Drop out the stress of daily life and marriage, the life of them seems to be of every possible and a real adventure to them, they just like branch and river, you carry me, i carry you.The movie really encourage me of never cease reading, traveling, willing to understand other people, and most importantly, the fate of believing in true life, the magic connection between human beings.

The reason for my review title is because love is never as ""simple"" as what it seems and perhaps should be at face value, it's usually more complicated and in this case it comes in the form of both Jesse and Celine living worlds apart but making the absolute most out of the time they have because they are both aware of the limited time they might share. Honestly, you should watch this movie, it's incredible.",

It's a romance, an old-school one, shot, cut and acted with such uncanny skill that it feels like a piece out of your life.",
343,25 January 2020,irmakafsar,9, A masterpiece,"Realistic script, actors with great chemistry, amazing cinematography and landscapes of Vienna. What more could be asked from this movie? Even though the lines were heavily rehearsed and there were zero improvisations, every dialogue and every glance the two lovers take at each other is absolutely raw. Especially the scene where the two are in the listening cabin and for around a minute we see them trying not to make eye contact. This is like real life because we see that the two are scared, they have their doubts. Love is a scary thing. This is what separates this movie from other romance movies -if this movie can even be called one- it's that romance is not the focus of the movie. Yes, it is present, but only after a deep emotional bond is formed between the two characters. It is not a surface level romance, like a fling, it is love. Pure deep love.
About the cinematography. The beauty of Vienna is perfectly captured. We see just enough of it, not too much that it bores us, not too little that we don't know where they are. Throughout the movie there are many places our characters go (the bar, the park, the bridge, etc.) and seeing these places without them in the last scene touches us as the audience. Because we realize that after this very short time they spent, all they have left are the memories they made. Life goes on in Vienna, as if the two never really were there.",

I like independent movies, romantic independent movies especially but this film left me apathetic. Some parts of it were terrific. The scene where they make imaginary phone-calls to their friends to talk about each other was wonderful. But if they fell so hard for each other then why didn't they feel the need to call or write? Because that would require too much effort? The ending causes this movie to fall short. The 'lets leave everything to chance' routine has been used so much in recent years its become groan inducing. Jesse says that people in a committed relationship become bored with each other once they've learned everything there is to know. That didn't sound real to me. It sounded like an excuse.",

The message just seemed pointless and didn't feel right for them, or in general. Still, it was well-executed for what it was.",

Every conversation is a priceless gem. It ranges to everything from palmistry to relationships. Most of the movie is about human relationships, we get to see two perspectives on everything. Undoubtedly one of the best romances ever written, the way it touches upon emetions all of us have felt at least once in our lives and makes us see it in a different light, there is so much to learn from the movie, so much to love about it. The conversations are as real as it can get, nothing superficious about it, just raw human emotions. The conversations never get preachy.There's stunning chemistry between the leads, they make you fall in love with them instantly.",

352,11 April 2017,ufster-2,9, There is something about it...,"This movie is a cult classic for a reason, a reason I can't firmly grasp nor articulate for that matter. On the surface, it is just your ordinary guy meets girl traveling and they fall in love script. Hardly original and only superficially interesting unless it happens to you, but it captures that mood exceptionally well, that feeling which we get when we're on the verge of starting something new, meeting that someone who gives us renewed hope to live and love again, when we're slowly but surely convinced that this is a turning point, a new chapter in our journey through life. It is a unique accomplishment to do this in a way that doesn't come off as either cynical or corny. To witness these young people inadvertently and carelessly take the steps which would deviate them from the path of their pre-arranged course is an empowering experience, no matter how you think their stories would unfold. As our heroine states, ""it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something.... the answer must be in the attempt"". ",

The dialogue between Delphy and Hawke does sometimes sound more like poetry than conversation! And of course because it takes place in beautiful Vienna!",

Watched it with my girlfriend... didn't regret it.",
358,15 February 2015,FedRev,10, A definitive statement on love in the modern world,"In 1995, Richard Linklater released Before Sunrise, and every nine years since has released a sequel. While sharing certain characteristics, each film is unique and worthwhile in their own right, but taken as a whole, this trilogy is something truly special. Some say that they are the best films about love and romantic relationships ever made, and they just might be. The series follows Jesse and Celine through the years. Jesse is an American traveling through Europe when he meets a French girl who is on her way home to Paris. They get to talking and Linklater's camera follows their conversation throughout the rest of that single day as the two fall in love. And every nine years, we revisit the couple at a different stage of life. Because of the time between the films we get the unique experience of watching two characters age, retaining the core of their personality, but taking on greater complexity as the years pass. The first film is about embracing the moment and forging a genuine human connection. The second film, Before Sunset, is about the regret of missed opportunities and the need to be true to yourself. The third film, Before Midnight, is about the consequences of actually getting what you want. Each film utilizes long takes which pull the audience deeply into the dialogue heavy narrative, and the fantastic performances by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy belie the fact that they're actually acting. These magical films are not to be missed.",
359,31 January 2021,laurenjfree,10, My Favorite Trilogy,"The dialogue. THE DIALOGUE! Where do I even begin? Every single detail in this movie felt so effortlessly natural. There's no explosions or car chases, but I was absolutely glued to my screen for the films entire duration. In fact, I dont think I even blinked. I could watch this movie over and over and over again and I'd ever get bored. It really is that good. The fact that this wasn't nominated for any major awards is mind boggling. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are so perfectly casted. They fully embody the characters to the point where it feels more like a reality TV show than a fictional story.",

This time i chose to go for Before Sunrise, after reading a review in a newspaper that it was a very good movie. And i was in for a really great time.

The scene in the record store has to be my favourite, I'm not giving anything away, if you've seen the movie you understand what I'm talking about.  The ending was exceptional, it's a movie that actually makes you wonder what happens after it ends.  The cinimatography was beautiful, the acting was wonderful, they worked so well together.  There is no hard core action, no nudity, no guns, no violence, only plot and dialogue, but the dialogue is the best I have experienced in a long while.",

365,29 December 2000,rajin22,8, I loved this one,"What a wonderful film. Watching it I started thinking, why aren't more of these films produced? It's so dazzlingly true to life that I feel everyone will be able to get something out of it and make a connection to his/her own life. Although not very well known,  this film is bound to become a romantic classic of the 90s, a film young people of now will put on again in ten or twenty years time to remember their youth by and to contemplate about what their life turned out to be. Nowhere is this, although very romantic, tale sugar-sweet or overdone. Nowhere is it boring, even though there isnt a big story-line. Vienna as a city didnt really appeal to me, but seeing the way they portrayed it in this film sure makes me want to go there now. An absolute jewel.",
366,30 December 2008,sramalin,10, Awesome movie....,"This has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy-meets-girl movies ever made. The film depicts romance in all it's glory, but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples. In short the film is about two people that have a relationship that's as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to - with just one problem, the problem of time. For those who feel love is just a fake, a concept, this movie will make you realize that maybe somewhere, somehow and some when, something could really happen. Although, nothing ever really happens, the movie never gets boring. The ending is genuinely sad without being ""Titanic"" or something. Recommend this movie to everyone..!",
367,4 April 2020,charishankar,9, And they fell in love,"'Before Sunrise' is a love story like no other. To classify it as a 'rom com' would be to do it signal disservice. It is an exquisite montage of beautiful moments, over the course of a single evening and night, involving just two people, over which ... it cannot really be said that they 'fall in love'. They are in love from the very first scene; that's apparent, but, over that unforgettable night, they realize what it means to both of them. Their love, as it were, acquires form and takes shape. Which is why I say that this is a love story like no other - I have not seen another film which, instead of relating how the lead characters FALL in love, relates, instead, how they understand what their love means to each of them.",
368,5 October 2000,sempai,8, Once Again Linklater Avoids Mediocrity!,"As in his other movies, Linklater has a terrific earthy reality to his movies which makes me feel like one of the characters. He always hits on my own personal issues so accurately that I feel like he's reading my mind. I always thought of such issues as mine alone, so I find his movies to be a cure for my own feelings of aloneness as well as for anyone of my generation (born in the 60s).",

The name sounded delicious and I could already notice I was going to fall in love with the story and it's characters.
Before Sunrise is now one of my favorite films and I believe it's one of the most beautiful movies you can see.

371,1 May 2009,pakatthetrack,9, Not Your Run of the Mill Romance,"Very boring in some places, a little corny in others, and sort of awkward in yet other parts. But overall, this movie charmed the very essence of the romance genre to a whole level. Although the entire movie is one long, drawn-out conversation, it cites philosophical and universally deep material that makes the viewer question his/her own relationships and pursuits. From beginning to end, this film attempts and succeeds admirably in capturing the timeless ritual of fundamental human interaction and courtship. Decent acting, amazing scenery, and an illustrious script all cooperate to make this movie a revitalizing breath of fresh air to romance watchers tired of stale, overused plots and predictable characters and stories. From its mundane beginning to its unique and worthwhile ending, Before Sunrise will have its loyal viewers aching for more, and its disappointed viewers at least thinking, in the back of their minds, about the meanings of their own lives.",

It's heartbreaking, though ultimately - because we have been party to a compassionate work of art - uplifting. Delpy & Hawke are perfect, and all in all this is a small, all too easily overlooked, gem. (Incidentally, I remember that Barry Norman, in his round-up of Best Of films for its year, completely ignored it - as he did that other modest pearl, Bagdad Cafe - which prompts me to wonder when British TV is going to get a film programme worthy of the name. Jonathan Ross? Huh! A better-dressed BN.)",

380,16 April 2005,classyBlue,9," Even though you cannot say it's love, the firm is a love story.","I like it because of my recent personal experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite. The characters in the firm did not really enjoy their ""real"" lives, but they did enjoy themselves, i.e. what they were. The movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory. A good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life. Many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those. Before Sunrise dealt with it in a nice way, which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film. Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head. It just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities. This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas. You would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story. The end was not quite important after all. You could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. Movies are supposed to be enjoyable. This is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it. I am on a journey too. The movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions.",

The characters, Jesse and Celine, are so real it's unnerving. This is a must see movie for anyone who still believes in romantic love.

It is one of the best romantic movies to have ever been made. The movie is loosely based on the life of the director Richard Linklater himself. An American man named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meets a French girl named Celine (Julie Delpy) on a train and the two decide to get off at Vienna. What follows after is a tale of two strangers talking through the streets of Vienna, getting to know each other and having fun while they are at it. The dialogues seem natural and realistic, the setting couldn't be more perfect, the shots are stunning and the performances by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are applause worthy. To get down from a train with a beautiful and charming stranger to a beautiful unknown place would be like a dream come true for all of us, and Before Sunrise is just that.

Given the American character is in Europe, I suppose I could compare aspects of the plot (thematically) to Lost in Translation, which is another great film about feeling somewhat lost and lonely. I wouldn't say the two main characters in this film are expressly lonely per se but there did feel (to me) to be that element of isolation and companionship of course. It is somewhat philosophical in tone - a somewhat deep film, moreso than a lot of the not so memorable romantic comedies. There are discussions about death, dreams and religion and the characters share some of their secrets.",

424,21 July 2018,meganweaver-72582,8, (Probably among the greatest romantic films ever made).,Richard Linklater is a talented filmmaker and Before Sunrise is his ode to romance using themes and techniques he would go on to use often in his films. It takes place in real time as we meet jessie and Celine played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy respectively. This is one of the most amazing chemistry in a major motion picture and kudos must go to the actors as much as the director. We follow these two all across Vienna and by the end of the film we totally relate to many things. Before Sunrise led to two great sequels which take place in real time and were shot in real time also(as in all the three films were filmed in a span of 18 years). This is art right here.,
425,8 May 2006,abb10-2,4," well, coming from the director of Dazed and Confuse, what would you expect?","The bottom line is whether or not the film was entertaining or not. Yes and no. The story depicts two people falling in love for the evening. But did the viewer become attached to their situation by the end? No, at the end of the film, the two forget the idea o never seeing each other again and decide to meet there exactly six months from that date, no matter the circumstances. At times the realness of the characters sort of turns a part of the audience off by giving away too much of the character's personalities. The part of the audience that could identify with particular traits of the characters was pleased, but the other became a bit alienated by doing this. This latter part of the audience, the part that was not so swayed by the character's identities, must have been thankful that the 18 plus hours of the adventure were not actually shot in real-time, or more relationships would have been weakened rather than strengthened due to one of the two leaving the movie theater out of pure boredom. The point is that the story was not maximized to its full potential. The characters were lacking traits that could have made them dynamic. Although Linklater was playing off of the realistic atmosphere he was trying to create, often this does not describe the reason people go to the movies: to fulfill a fantasy; to enter a new, entertaining world for a ninety minute time span. If the viewer is not entranced by the artificial world created within the movie, then viewers will not be inspired. And if there exists no inspiration, then life would get, well, boring.",

That's why I for the first time started to read user comments and for this film only. I was surprised how many people from over the Globe share the same or similar feeling and insight about it.

436,20 April 2023,megannc,7, Character Development...,"""Before Sunrise"" tells the simple story of two strangers who meet on a train in Europe and spend a single night together. This effective story telling shows just quickly love can develop and that by being vulnerable and opening up, you learn a lot about yourself as well. While there is little going on in the story, it is still captivating mostly through the script. The script is done really well so that the audience gets to know the characters as they get to know each other. This allows us to place ourselves in the shoes of the characters and have a better understanding of the feelings they are possessing. Additionally, the camera and shots of this movie include the use of several minute single shots. Additionally, the placement of the characters in the frame gives them a very realistic feel with a lot of medium shots, these techniques combined give the viewer the feel that they are right with the characters. The overall lack of plot allows us to focus more on the characters' past rather than what they are actively doing and places this as a central theme of the movie. Overall, this movie uses a lot of relatively simple techniques to tell a captivating love story. The medium shots, long takes, and slightly unsteady camerawork make it feel like the viewer is right there in the movie. This also shows that a lack of central plot or action can still create an impactful story with the value of character development.",

After watching most romance movies, single viewers are left feeling more lonely than before, but Before Sunrise offers something different. It gives the viewer almost the exact opposite, a hope that somewhere out there in the world, there is a person that can complete you and understand you, and maybe one day you will cross paths. Even though the plot line is not particularly action-packed, it is so emotionally engaging. The movie is so successful in portraying the feeling of falling in love, in longing, loneliness, and pain in having to say goodbye.

447,15 December 2014,ayush000054,9, Undoubtedly one of the most romantic movie of all time,"Undoubtedly one of the most romantic movies of all time, Before Sunrise follows two strangers (Ethan Hawke's Jesse and Julie Delpy's Celine) as they meet on a train and immediately hit it off - with the film detailing the pair's subsequent walk through the streets of Venice. It's a simple premise that's executed to impressively engrossing effect by filmmaker Richard Linklater, as the director, working from a screenplay co written with Kim Krizan, kicks the proceedings off with a captivating meet-cute that's heightened by the palpable chemistry between Hawke and Delpy. The characters' utterly charming dynamic ensures that their conversations are, for the most part, far more compelling than one might'V anticipated, with Linklater and Krizan's script packed full of cogent observations about topics as varied as relationships, death, and religion. It goes without saying, of course, that Before Sunrise is at its best during its more blatantly romantic moments, with, in particular, Jesse and Celine's first kiss ranking high on the movie's list of swoon-worthy sequences.

451,15 January 2021,lilygirlchapman,2, Quirky Screenplay Romance: The Motion Picture,"Linklater relies entirely on the screenplay for the success of Before Sunrise. Any other filmmaking techniques, such as shot composition, music, editing, are all minimalised or abandoned in favor of the dialogue between the two protagonists. In any case, this would infer that his intention is to trap them in a void together, surrounding them entirely and hinging the viewer's experience on the characters'. In essence, Linklater banks on you to accept Jesse and Celine as genuine, and indulges entirely on the chemistry between the actors and the kinetic ability of the script. As a supplement, he includes an ever changing roulette of background environments, of which are responsible for much of the characters' dialogue. It's a wholly reactionary experience, and in framing the story in such a singular matter as to entrap Jesse and Celine in their own world is the mistake Linklater makes in attempt to force the film's romance. The movie enacts itself like a test reading between two actors testing the script for its energy. It's not as much a complete cinematic experience as it is a manifestation of the dialogue written on the paper, and the actors not so much characters as they are the actors reading who the characters are supposed to be. The movie feels void of the people it's trying to create and instead representative of the efforts an actor reaches to try and form their character, but the script refusing to comply with this action as it believes so entirely in its characters as people that it insists upon it to the point that any performer involved ends up just that; a performer. The screenplay and the actors and the production all are at odds with each other, with the actors acting a screenplay that simultaneously begs to be acted and yet is incompatible with acting because its nature revolves around the existence of an actor acting, not for the sake of realism or performance but because of insistence. The world around the characters is forgotten in this clash of creator and creation, and the result is a sterile experience, the audience lost in this unruly amalgamation of confused enactment. By isolating him and her in a world of their own, it's clear that there is no place for a third party in it. Any interruption to their world in-universe is quickly dismissed, but not without being acknowledged. The audience is never acknowledged, not beyond the character's intentionally snappy dialogue that functions more as an indulgent conversation by Linklater between himself and himself as though challenged to write the most screenplay screenplay possible. In the end, it's nothing but an exercise in dialogue training that a high school junior would write for his fifty dollar film class at the local studio.",

This also because the writers and director give the actors the chance to portray the moods of the situations (which is something you also rarely see) So this movie is not about dolly shots, love at first site or ""Oeh, I did not expect that ending!"" but it is about human honesty.

489,9 May 2005,anggungunara,9, Even Better after a Great Sequel,"I bought the DVD of Before Sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago. Having saw it twice, I couldn't help but missing Before Sunrise, not because the sequel was not as great, but I felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did, every time I finished watching one of them, I feel the need and yearning to see the other. So, I ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly, I will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly. The most remarkable thing about Before Sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other. It sounds so simple, the growing of the chemistry, I think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development, but to me - who doesn't believe in Nora Ephron - Before Sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it. When I saw it for the first time, about 8 year ago when I was 20, I already liked it. But, I didn't rate it as a ""great film"", it still seemed to me like another thinking persons' feel good movie, Linklater was too smart to make it more realistic, it was 10 minutes too long, the characters was too well fabricated, I thought I liked it because it was like a dream and because I enjoyed their conversations, etc. etc.. But now, thanks to Before Sunset, I feel that's more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before. I saw the elements more clearly: Jesse, Celine, Vienna, their conversations, everything. How each of them are separated element by itself, and they have a chance to mix, the story is just a frame of time, I am no longer feel manipulated. And the freedom that every scene has, as well as its refusal to be overly efficient, how blind I was that those qualities didn't strike me as exceptional when I first saw it! Now, 8 year have passed, the more movies I've seen, the more I realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending, even movies like Pulp Fiction or Linklaters's own Slackers included. The Jesse and Celine tale avoid that, maybe Before Sunset is a better example in this case, but Before Sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time, not a destination, every single scene has its own life. I don't know whether Linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made Before Sunrise, but to me, one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other. Before Sunrise which I think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes, seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding Jesse and Celine, the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it. Meanwhile, I enter the vision of boredom as Jesse stuck talking to the journalists in Before Sunset, and Celine's first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile I've seen in a beginning of a film, and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place I don't know with a sadness in me, no matter how beautiful Paris is, and no matter how happy I am that they meet again. I'm sorry that I go on this long with my limited English, Before Sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts, and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it.",

A beautifully directed romantic journey, it is sweet, it is funny, it is emotional, and it is intricate. No matter when you watch it, it will always take you back to the feeling of the 90s' romantics. The twills of slow, intimate scenes with no dialogue give this movie its flavor, makes it human. And where there is dialogue, it never fails to make us smile and blush.

506,18 June 2018,abeernegm,9, Big believer in love ?,"You know how you've always imagined the love story that would get you off your feet and meeting ""the one"".. this movie, made it vivid to me. It's not so obvious and big romantic cliche stuff , it's subtle , more intellect oriented, sophisticated and yet so simple you can't help it. Hats off to the dialogue between them, i've never felt connected to a character as much as i did with Celine.",

509,17 September 2015,cincybngl,10, **Spoilers Two people who fall in love in Venice in less than 24 hours.,"Before Sunrise written and directed by Richard Linklater follows two differing people Celine, played by Julie Delpy, and Jesse, played by Ethan Hawke. This is a tragic love story about 2 people who meet on the Eurrail in 1995 and spend one memorable night in Venice. We spend the better part of 101 minutes getting to know two characters who inevitably by sunrise must part ways. Celine, who lives in Paris is traveling back from Budapest from visiting her grandmother. Jesse, whom we find has come to Europe to see his now ex-girlfriend and after breaking up with her after 2 days in Madrid has traveled the Eurrail for almost 3 weeks. While on the train Jesse strikes up a conversation with Celine about a German couple arguing on their train. When they reach Jesse's destination of Venice, in which he has a flight out at 930am, he persuades Celine to get off the train and spend the evening with him in Venice. ",
510,2 February 2021,holmescott-23753,8, Beautiful film,"This film got recommended to me a year ago and I have have been over hyping it in my head since then. When I got around to seeing it, it wasn't as great as I hyped it up to be because it is a very simple film. This film is very present and Linklater doesn't use any non-linearity because he wants the audience to know as much as the characters know.
If you don't hype it up and go in without any expectation you will be surprised.",
511,29 May 2020,cancerianabhishek,10, Just about perfect.,"I have revisited this series over half a dozen times in the past decade, just like how the team of the film revisits the characters every 9 years or so. And I have never had any reason to complain.
It is one of the most perfect films that I have seen. It makes you see the magic in little things, in those conversations that you have around with people. The dialogues of the movie are so good thar you might want to check out the script or revisit it to note it doen somewhere. Watching the 3 parts in totality is nothing short of an ethereal experience, and none more so than the first film.
It is easily one of the most beautiful experiences you could have while watching a film. Don't miss.",
512,27 November 2020,da3zcreator,8, I'll give this movie 8/10 because of the simple story,"I'll give this movie 8/10 because of the simple story and I like this kind of stories that can happen to any person, anytime and anywhere, A young man and woman meet on a train in Europe, and wind up spending one evening together in Vienna. Unfortunately, both know that this will probably be their only night together.
First thing first, nobody can disagree with me about the chemistry between the two characters, and that shows spatially in the eye contact scenes and honestly that makes me little bit cringe, because all of us has this situation in some part of his life, and the other compliment that makes the movie great is the script, the script is the most important thing in romantic movies it can makes the romantic movie a romantic movie, and that's why people this days doesn't like romantic movies anymore, because of the script most of the time it's not realistic and the script in this movie was so realistic spatially in the scene when they was playing that game at the bar and they start talking and keep the conversation going with no cuts, And that's the other scene when this chemistry shine, Now let's move on to the technical stuff, Honestly i don,t remember much things about the cinematography and sound because i watched this movie before 3 weeks i guess, But i remember that the acting was so much perfect but just the two main characters, The secondary characters i guess they are just some random people spatially the tree guy
Finally do i recommend this movie for people who doesn't like romantic movies ? For sure , Like i just said at the beginning it's just a simple love story that can happen to anyone, not like the other tragedy movies when randomly someone get killed, just because of the rule that said should romantic movies be sad, i don't know who create that rule, anyway just go watch it if you wanna chill with your gf or by yourself",

515,26 October 2022,zoevincentius,8, The Play that reopened my heart,"How You played and the story made me remember why I started studying theater and acting. Opened my heart, it is true, remembered me how beautiful is the youth and to feel healthy and vivid is so natural; made me remembered how much I loved life, to life fully is so energetic and that We shall do that! Also inspired and remembered me on important topics I care for. The message about the opportunists I so true, and they are also so importantly coloring our lives ~ Love and Trust Yes <3 Thank You for all the makers and doers <3 It's A Lyric Overflod ha-ha-ha! <3 Truly healing (: (: (: ... I can tell, that I have got a similar story in real that has happened to me, not exactly like this one, actually more stories about falling in love and than getting on a different track by life and sail away from eachother and saying goodby is like tearing apart something that wanted to be so much one and stay as one more times and that gives me tears. I got to learn how to say bye happily to be remembered that way not because I really felt like that, yet that was an act of art ahhhh! Theater I was so much I love with the magical world of stories, and the freedom of expressing, it is so bold to be and actress or an actor. I wanted to live as much I could therefore I've chosen theater - it gave me so much expanded boundaries and words into my mouth thus I could express myself fluidly <3 Thank You for You were able to remind me of all these, I feel like my heart is overflowing after several years <3 /// I am writing scripts since a while to color people's lives !!!

516,8 June 2023,pencylucero,10, Impeccable storytelling and timeless,"The strength of ""Before Sunrise"" lies in its remarkable storytelling. Linklater skillfully weaves a narrative that unfolds over the course of a single night in Vienna, following the chance encounter between Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy). The film's ingenious simplicity allows the audience to become intimately involved in the evolving relationship between the two protagonists, as they embark on a spontaneous journey through the moonlit streets of the city. The organic and unhurried pacing of the story creates a deeply immersive experience, evoking a sense of time standing still, as if we are wandering alongside Jesse and Celine, sharing their conversations and witnessing their emotional connection blossom.",

518,19 August 2006,alexziegler,5, Relatively slow moving dialog between two strangers that become lovers,"This is a nicely done film with good acting by the two principal actors, although it is very slow moving and really oriented toward the ""twenty something"" crowd. We kept expecting something more exciting to happen, which never materialized. In the end, we could not understand the high ratings it received when compared to films like The English Patient and many others, which had slightly lower ratings on IMDb. ",

520,16 March 2013,nazzyboy97,10, A film with the most simplest of plots with a beautiful story,"Before watching this film I had always regarded The Godfather as my favorite film of all time. Since then, every film I have watched has not met the bar which had been set so very high until Before Sunrise. Why is this the best film of all time? Because you will struggle to find another film like it. The plot is so straightforward; a boy is on a train to catch a flight which will head him back to America alongside a girl on the same train who is travelling back to France. They both meet in conversation and together, decide to spend the next 24 hours within the beautiful and gorgeous city of Vienna. Sounds like an easy and simple plot but what makes this film so enthralling and interesting is what happens in Vienna and the thoughts and feelings expressed by the two lead characters, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy who portray such outstanding and realistic performances which make you forget that they are just acting. This is a film which consists heavily of pure dialogue which may put off some people; however that is the beauty of the film. There are no explosions, car chases or action scenes but simply two people exploring each other inside a wonderful city debating about such topics such as Reincarnation, Death, Love and many more. The conversations are so real, so vivid and so dreamlike that it makes the film it own. It's almost as though they are in an alternate reality where their normal routine life is put to a hold and they escape inside a dream world. Towards the end where the night is over and the sun has risen, Ethan Hawke's character Jesse quotes that they have gone back into ""real time"" which shows that the moments they have shared and the collection of memories that they have made, are those which will last forever in their own little world and time. A classical romance which does well to stray away from the old cheesy and clichéd films of that genre, Before Sunrise is superbly filmed and wonderfully acted with rich, pure and realistic dialogue making it one of those rare films that shine with magnificence, a film that everyone has to see.",
521,7 January 2015,young_lady2008,8," when you feel it, just live it","this is one of the most beautiful romance movie I ever seen.. i liked the dialog very much.. but i was disappointed with the end.. actually i would rather if they didn't agree to meet again. maybe i wanted it to be a big love story that didn't last. that makes you wonder how many people you met and left in a short time but managed to leave a huge marks on you and may your life will never be the same ... and that the one who understands you the most may just be thrown in your way, when you feel it just live it and it doesn't matter if it is a one day love, it is worth it .. there is stories worth to be added in your book life even if it is not long ..",
