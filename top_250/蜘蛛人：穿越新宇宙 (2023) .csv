0,31 May 2023,MiroslavKyuranov,10, One Step Above Masterpiece!,"It's honestly absurd how good the ""Spider-Verse"" movies are. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is just as great, if not better than ""Into the Spider-Verse"". I really don't know how. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen's story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham's Captain Stacy are truly special.",/
1,2 June 2023,UniqueParticle,10, Masterful IMAX Spider-Man,"The animation, flow of everything, genius character development, and action were all electrifying! This is one of the best Spider-Man adaptions deserving of the high ratings entirely. I love all the portals connecting to other dimensions and Spot is such a fun villain. Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfield, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much.",r
2,2 June 2023,pugpool10,10, One of the best sequels to anything ever made,"If it wasn't already obvious in the first film, it's now officially clear as day that the people behind the Spider-Verse franchise (including writers/producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who are absolute creative godsends to the once magnificent place known as Hollywood) understand EXACTLY what they're working with.",e
3,31 May 2023,hectorvernet,10, Okay This Is Peak,"First off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, Harry Potter style. Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn't have ""Part One"" in the title. It doesn't really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it's kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can't wait to see the next one.",v
4,2 June 2023,rickothan,10, A new Empire Strikes Back,"This film is a visual concert. The animation and character design neatly put me to tears. The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece.",i

6,2 June 2023,gabethedinosaur,10, The multiverse has opened the doors to the Spiderverse,It was absolutely awesome. I felt like I was traveling from the multiverse to my childhood back in 2002 when I saw Tobey maguire Spider-Man 21 years ago when I was 7 years old. And seeing all the other spider people including Spider-cat and Spider-rex . The spot traveling to venoms universe was absolutely hilarious. I hope to see ultimate Spider-Man from the video game I never finished on GameCube or Xbox for almost 17 years since I was a kid. Seeing 2018 Spider-Man from the PS4 game was very outstanding. I hope in Spider-Man beyond the spiderverse meets Tobey maguire and miles teams up with him and he helps him build the device and Gwen meets Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man and they help build the same device to bring miles home .,w
7,2 June 2023,samfarrow-90556,10, the greatest spider-man film ever.,"I am absolutely lost for words. How the hell did they top the first one??? This is easily, without a shadow of a doubt, the film of the year. It perfectly balances humour and emotional beats on a razor thin blade. It's richly layered, complex and the attention to detail is absolutely incredible. The story is phenomenal, the characters are believable and have excellent levels of depth, the soundtrack is fantastic. My expectations were completely exceeded, I spent the entire 2h 30m runtime in awe. But one thing above all deserves very special praise :",/
8,31 May 2023,srdjankostic91,10," Wow, just WOW!","I rarely write reviews, but this movie is truly exceptional. It takes everything that was great about the first film and elevates it to a whole new level. I have honestly never witnessed such remarkable animation as in ""Across the Spider-Verse."" The visuals are breathtaking, featuring a wide array of styles. It is a true multiverse experience, with an abundance of captivating details in every frame, including numerous Easter eggs and a vibrant color palette. I found myself not wanting it to end, despite its substantial length. Knowing that the next part will be released in 2024 brings me immense joy because waiting a few more years to see how this story unfolds would be agonizing.",r
9,31 May 2023,Tired_Reviewer,10, Perfect,"The 5 years was worth the wait. Amazing animation, beautiful characters with rich backstories, the fights are amazing, Gwen's story is amazing, EVERYTHING IS AMAZING! This entire movie is gorgeous and keeps you hooked and almost forces you to continue watching, that's how amazing it is. The hype around this movie was 100% deserved and made sense, seeing as how this movie may be the greatest film I have ever seen.",w

12,1 June 2023,cricketbat,7, My feelings about this sequel are currently glitching,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is probably my favorite Spider-Man movie. However, my feelings about Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse are currently glitching. On one hand, the action scenes are spectacular, and the animation is, once again, amazing. On the other hand, this movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it feels like it. Plus, the visuals can be so kinetic that the film becomes busy & chaotic. This sequel offers some real drama, however it's not a complete story, and it ends on a cliffhanger. I think my rating will solidify when I watch Beyond the Spider-Verse and see how it all ends.",0
13,2 June 2023,ykjdh,10, Spidey done right,This might possibly be one of the best movies I've seen all year. I'll definitely put it in my top two for the year. The comics look better in animation in my opinion and the design of this super man looked great in IMAX.,6
14,4 June 2023,ayoreinf,10, It's not a movie about characters from the comics - it's a comics book made into a movie,"I was really blown away by this masterpiece. It's beautiful, clever, funny and deep. And it dares being a comics in each and every frame. It never allows you to forget these are drawn characters you see. Unlike so many animated movies of recent time it doesn't go for the smooth polished look it makes certain we never forget that we watch a comics book that was brought to life on screen. Just like Rembrandt made sure we all see his brush strokes when we watch his paintings. But just like Rembrandt, it's done without allowing the technical mastery of it all to drop one little bit. But it's way more than simple issue of the looks of it. This is comics all the way, thematically as well as visually, hence the ending we got.",8
15,2 June 2023,JettblkIMDB,10, BEST ANIMATED FILM OF ALL TIME AND ITS ONLY A PART ONE?!,"Out of any film in history, no crew of writers has gone so out there with the writing choices.

17,3 June 2023,poseyfan,10, The animation alone is a mesmerizing spectacle. That paired with the excellent story puts it at another level.,"One of the best animated movies I've ever seen, hands down. I wasn't the biggest fan of the first. I thought it was a tad overrated. This one takes the strengths of the first and ups it to 11.",/
18,1 June 2023,Blashma,10, A movie worth every penny and time you spend,The movie did a great job in the first part and I really enjoyed it so personally I am especially looking forward to the second part and after watching the movie it exceeded my expectations.,?

20,4 June 2023,IsThatJoseph21,10, My new favorite Spider-Man movie,"For the past two years, No Way Home was my favorite Spider-Man movie. Now, that title belongs to Across the Spider-Verse. Besides being a great Spider-Man movie, I'd consider this a great movie in general. I just saw Across the Spider-Verse, but I already feel comfortable placing this movie in the same category of sequels like The Empire Strikes Back, Aliens, Terminator 2, and The Dark Knight, which surpass every aspect of their predecessors.",e

22,31 May 2023,ahmadmobeenqazi,10, Web of Wonders,I was fortune enough to attend the premiere here in Singapore. A non-spoiler review follows:,_
23,3 June 2023,matris1,8, Spider-man: Middle of the Spider-Verse,The good: This is a gorgeous and competently made film. With every scene / direction / frame constructed meticulously and it shows. It pushes the boundaries of animated movies and does it with style. The voice acting is good. The movie respect and pays homage to spider-man lore whilst offering something fresh (had to pull off). Almost all the side characters feel real and fleshed out - even those with minimal screen time.,=
24,5 June 2023,finnconnelly-63017,10, Best Picture? Best Picture.,"Across the Spider-Verse has done the impossible: be better than Into the Spider-Verse. And by leaps and bounds too. The animation is spectacular. Every frame looks like a Van Gogh, a Picasso. It makes Into the Spider-Verse look like a first grader painted it. The voice cast is very well done, Oscar Isaac, Haliee Steinfeld, and Andy Samberg are definite highlights. The action sequences are superb, but they complement a fantastic story that when its massive cliffhanger hits you, you'll be begging for more. Daniel Pemberton brings his A game once again with a score that's even better than the first. Across the Spider-Verse succeeds in every way, and should be seen on the biggest screen possible.",t

to watch it. After watching ITSV I keep asking myself ' Where Am I? '",_
27,6 June 2023,Dominic_25_,8," I understand why this film is so incredibly highly rated, even for an opening weekend, but I do think it is a tad overrared online.",I don't remember how long it has been since I've seen the first one but I am pretty sure I liked it better than this one. This is both a sequel and an unfinished story which negatively impacts my interpretations.,u
28,2 June 2023,georgetbarber,7, Audible groan from the cinema when it finished,"Adjusted rating - 8.5/10: a genuine spectacle, you could take thousands of shots from this movie and turn them into posters, it's beautiful to look at. I'd definitely suggest seeing this at the cinema because the use of colours and the work which has gone into the animations is undoubtedly the highlight, I actually can't think of a more visually creative movie I've seen. Great soundtrack too, and quite funny. One of my criticisms is it's got that ""Deadpool"" kind of style where literally everything is tongue in cheek, it needed more genuinely serious scenes just to break it up. Like there are these big arguments and then a joke is thrown in half way through, who does that? Also it's got quite bad dialogue but it's a family superhero movie so I went in expecting that, only a minor point really.",r
29,2 June 2023,FeastMode,7, Half of a movie,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the first of a two part movie. These studios should be legally required to put ""part 1"" in the title. Fast X did the same thing and I felt unsatisfied when the movie abruptly ends with everything completely unresolved.",v
30,1 June 2023,eddie_baggins,8, Lightning strikes twice in this top-notch sequel,"Not even the most optimistic of pundits could've ever predicted the glowing reception and success that came the way of 2018's Into the Spider-Verse, slinging to almost $400 million at the worldwide box office, critical praise and a spot entrenched in the upper echelons of the IMDB's Top 250 Movies of All Time list, too say that the first iteration of the Spider-Verse animated universe was a roaring and unexpected success would be a huge understatement.",
31,3 June 2023,mrbledsoe53,7, Visual Overstimulation,"As visually stunning and groundbreaking of the animation, unfortunately, it was too much to take. I'm in my early 40s so younger viewers probably won't be affected as much. Didn't have an issue with Into the Spider-verse, but apparently, they increased the intensity to the point that I left with a headache. The different frame rates of characters in the same scene, the visual distortion in the background at times, made it difficult to focus and was basically visual overstimulation. I enjoyed the story and would like to see Beyond the Spider-verse but may have to just read about it if the animation is as intense as this film.",
32,4 June 2023,pranayjalvi,10, Each frame was rich and dazzling,"Across the Spider-Verse looks incredible, even better than the groundbreaking first installment, but what's truly impressive about it is how willing it is to entrust its storytelling to its animation. There's not a frame of this rich, kaleidoscopically detailed animation that isn't dazzling.",
33,1 June 2023,heyrandom,10, Completely exceeded my expectations,"I was worried that Across the Spiderverse would not be able to match the success of it's predecessor Into the Spiderverse, but boy was I wrong. Across the Spiderverse blows it's predecessor out of the water. With higher stakes, more emotion and improvements on the already brilliant animation. My only annoyance with the film was that the British and Indian spiderman were very hard to understand, but once it hits streaming services that can be fixed with subtitles. The movie sadly does end on a cliffhanger as it is being released in two parts with the second part coming out in March 2024. I think Across the spiderverse has a real shot at the Oscar for best animated pictures, which Into the Spiderverse won in 2019.",
34,8 June 2023,penelopemmorris,6, So Overhyped That I Felt Disappointed,"I was a huge fan of the first movie, excited for the sequel and pretty hopeful after I saw massive amount of RAVE reviews online claiming it to be better than the original. Well, that couldn't be further from the truth. The runtime was way too long and I FELT it from the beginning of the movie! (during Gwen's 20 minute opening.) By the time the film picked up its pace and stakes (the last 30 minutes) I was already mentally checking out, watching the time and waiting for it to end. And yes, basically nothing is resolved by the end of it, if you're wondering. Multiple people in my theater were groaning as the credits began rolling, due to the cliffhanger. Scenes stretched on far too long, had repetitive dialogue and just set up the final movie. I truly don't see the hype about this one. I think the wrap up next year will be good, I have seen films do a better job in a trilogy of making the second movie mean something. I feel harsh saying this, as the animation, soundtrack and characters are awesome! I just feel like people are acting like this is the best animated movie to be released, but it's just not. It doesn't live up to the greatness of it's predecessor. Hopefully the finale next year will make it all worth it!",
35,5 June 2023,tavismelvin,6, Not great but it's good.,"Not great but it's good. They could of made this movie about 30mins shorter tbh. There's a few things I don't like about this movie. I found it sort of stupid that in a world of Spider-Man, not one Spider-Man could catch Morales. Just found it odd. You watch a whole movie to get a Clift hanger. Which wasn't that great. I felt like we were missing a big climax that never happened. I found the characters in the first movie more funny. They sort of tried too hard on this one. The cgi comic book art is cool. I find it distracting at times and it takes away from the emotions. I don't know I just had higher expectations from what reviews were saying.",
36,5 June 2023,Karamakate,10," Breathtaking, stunningly beautiful","Into the Spider-Verse showed us just a crumb of visual possibilities; Across the Spider-Verse doesn't hold back and brings us the most stunning visuals we've ever seen in animation. The details in the animation is mindblowing, like Miles' new suit that feels vibrant with the colors and texture.",
37,1 June 2023,benjaminskylerhill,9, An excellent half a movie,"Today, I saw some of the most inventive, bold, and charming sequences I have ever witnessed on a big screen.",
38,1 June 2023,shrikrishnasriram,10, A worthy follow-up to perfection.,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse not only builds upon the brilliance of its predecessor but takes the scope of it to a whole new level. The film plunges audiences into an exhilarating journey across dimensions, where familiar characters and new faces collide in a visually stunning and emotionally resonant narrative.",
39,3 June 2023,masonsaul,10, Worthy sequel,"From its very first opening moments, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an undeniable work of art. A bigger, bolder sequel that's not afraid to take its time with its character's growth and truly understands the character. Exploring in extremely meta, reality bending fashion the true burden of being Spider-Man.",
40,5 June 2023,cedricdumler,10, A Multiversal Masterpiece!,"Wow. An already great year for movies, just got extended by a masterpiece of filmmaking.",
41,6 June 2023,nickryan-44535,7," It's good, but I still like the first one better. (7.5)","Let me just say that the first hour of this film had me hooked and I just knew this film surpass it's predecessor in terms of the story & entertainment. Around the 2 hour mark I started wondering when or if there would be a climax? Various scenes felt like they were dragging on for way too long. We really didn't need all the scenes of Peter B. Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler. I believe it is still a movie worth seeing, however, it falls short of the first movie in terms of keeping my attention.",
42,6 June 2023,vinniec-53536,10, A Revolutionary Masterpiece,"In 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse', the follow-up to 2018's 'Into the Spider-Verse', we catch up with Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) as he tries his best to juggle his responsibilities as a student and son alongside his role as Brooklyn's one-and-only Spider-Man. However, when a new villain called The Spot (Jason Schwartzman) emerges and fellow spider-powered hero Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) unexpectedly returns, our friendly neighborhood wall-crawler embarks on an adventure that takes him way out of his neighborhood. In the same vein as such classic sequels as 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Dark Knight', 'Across the Spider-Verse' tells a darker, more mature story than its predecessor, while still retaining much of the heart and humor that made it so beloved. While the film contains quite a few pretty heavy moments, there are also some wholesome, endearing ones as well, creating a nice balance. Revelations are revealed that give more depth to Miles and Gwen, and we see them make tough decisions that perfectly reflect who they are as characters. Some intriguing new players are introduced as well, such as the anti-establishment Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya) and the no-nonsense Miguel O'Hara (Oscar Isaac), that add additional layers and perspectives to the story. The latter in particular creates a unique dilemma for Miles that no 15-year-old should have to face. The film also does a terrific job of taking a villain who starts out as an unintimidating joke and turns him into a terrifying threat by the end. While Miles himself is always a delight to watch, Gwen stole the show for me this time. She has a much bigger role than she did in 'Into the Spider-Verse' and takes her well-deserved place in the spotlight alongside Miles as essentially co-lead. With all that said, the film's biggest strength is absolutely its revolutionary visuals. 'Across the Spider-Verse' brilliantly blends multiple animation styles into a dazzling four-course feast for the eyeballs, so much so that as I went to sleep that night I was still trying to process everything I'd seen. From the beautiful environments to the mind-blowing action sequences to the characters themselves, every single shot in this movie is downright entrancing. In conclusion, 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' is unlike anything I've ever experienced. It's a true masterpiece of comic-book movies, of animation, and of filmmaking in general. The bar has been raised. Other studios, take notes: this is how it's done.",

It was beautifully animated, and it has elements that could have made it the greatest Spider-Man movie of all time. However, compared to ""Into the Spider-Verse"", which is quite possibly one of the greatest animated movies I've ever seen, it suffers from some serious flaws that took me out of the experience and have been nagging me ever since.

Every line of dialogue, story beat, voice actor, are all perfect. Metro Boomin's songs and Daniel Pemberton's score are perfect. I love every second of this movie. It hit me hard man. This is my Empire Strikes back, my Infinity War. Planning on seeing it again multiple times. See it on the best screen possible. I love Miles and Gwen's relationship. Miguel is a fantastic and complex character. There is so much here for every Spider-Man fan to enjoy. And there is plenty for people who aren't fans too.",

58,5 June 2023,demonblade-37792,8, 5 Years Was Worth the Wait!,"The first impression of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is that the cinematography is visually stunning. The artwork and animations of the characters and backgrounds are pleasing to watch. Kudos to the artist team who put the hard work in. I loved how we saw almost and if not every Spider-Person from all the universes. My personal favorite was Spider-Punk being played by Daniel Kaluuya because he is a punk-rock character, but also still chill and nonchalant at the same time. It was glad seeing Miles Morales (Shamiek Moore) back in action as his and also Spider-Gwen's (Hailee Steinfield) stories dissolve all into one movie. It was nice to see that we have strong antagonists being played by Spot (Jason Schwartzman) and Spider-Man 2099/ Miguel O' Hara (Oscar Isaac). Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is great with its voice acting, cinematography, and the story. I would recommend watching it in theaters because I am going for a second viewing!",

Sam raimi's spiderman 2 being my second favourite. That's just to let you have a feel if my review is likely to be similar to yours, if you agree with my top 2. Ten out of ten for the first film, so to be fair, this one had a lot to live up to. First half of the film, I found my mind wandering a bit. Nice animation but at times, the action shots were really not clear. Family stuff was very well done but the main baddy was hard to take serious. The film definitely got much better in the second half which is a huge relief as I really did not want to not like this film. It doesn't have the humour of the first film or as good music, but it still improved enough, for me to go and see the third film.",

In some scenes I was so bored, I even fell asleep. I don't think the effects are as good as the first movie. But still not bad of course. I had fun. Spidermen were great. It was so good to see different spidermen. The action wasn't bad either. The ""meme scene"" was so funny. But there was something that wasn't there. Also, the fact that they ended the movie halfway like a series lowered my respect for the movie. It was like a filler movie then. It could be better. Unfortunately, I don't know how the original voiceovers are not yet, since I watched it with dubbing. But I'm sure it's very good. Once again, I'll probably watch it in English. Anyway, I think it was a good animated movie, but not as good as the first movie.",

Highly recommend to anyone even if they aren't a fan of Spider-Man or Marvel. It's a fun movie for anyone to enjoy! In all honesty, the movie had me calling out every cameo/easter egg I could find since it was filled with them. And I never do that for any movie.

Although the cliffhanger is slightly frustrating for a movie like this but it also sets up the next movie perfectly with Miles being in Earth-42 and Gwen being with the original spider-crew.

I've seen plenty of superhero films and have sometimes been pretty entertained by them, but there are relatively few films in the genre that I would consider great. Fresh, fun, compelling and visually stunning, ""Into the Spider-Verse"" felt like a unique breath of fresh air from increasingly/more generic and fan service-y comic book films. Its unique style, character development, and soundtrack also helped contribute to its quality and memorability. The sequel, ""Across the Spider-Verse,"" is almost as great as the first.

Truly a work of art. The way each Spiderperson had their own unique style continues to be a highlight of this franchise. It was really cool to see all the different variations of Spider-Man all in one movie. With that being said the script was a little misguided, and really failed to tell a solid story in one movie. The focus of this movie is fractured, and we as an audience are along for the ride. Definitely feels like an extended 2nd act. I've aways said a movie should be more than sequel bait, and I feel the writers stretched this story to get one more movie out of it.

The multiverse is pretty hard to understand but this movie makes it very easy. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, Metro boomin was great and I cant stop listening.

I expected Miguel to have more of a role aside from the final 30 minutes of the movie, same goes for the villain who is introduced with a rushed backstory who only makes 1 more appearance in the entire second half of the movie.

I already had unhealthy high expectations for this movie, yet it still exceeded those expectations far beyond reach. It lives up to its title by plunging us right back into the chaotic madness of the multiverse by delving into Gwen's perspective, exploring her dynamics with her family and the hardships that come with juggling two different identities while not letting either one overlap or dominate. The Gwen-centered prologue spans for a whopping 15 minutes. It chronicled everything from dramatic character-affirming moments and extravagant artistic expression to mesmerisingly fluid action sequences and laugh-out-loud snippets of levity. It's basically a microcosm of what we are about to expect from the remaining runtime, giving us just a taste of the absolute carnage that is bound to unfold. And my god, did this movie deliver!",
86,31 May 2023,faeez_rizwan,9, Spidertacular Movie,This movie makes the best case for how animation rather than live action can capture so many facets of what make comicbooks so appealing. There's a reason why Japan largely turns to animation for so many of its high concept ideas and futuristic worlds. Animation can capture so much that is lost in live action.,

And in this movie they explore Miles and Gwen relationship with each other. And Peter has MJ and a child. And all the characters they can have. There's so much references to The whole spider verse.

98,4 June 2023,vishalmellark,10, LOVE LETTER FROM SONY AND MARVEL,"Across the Spider-Verse strikes the perfect chord, like a symphony of web-slinging hilarity. It swings through the cinematic landscape with impeccable pacing, juggling character development and action like a circus performer on caffeine. The voice acting is A-grade, with Isaac brooding so intensely that I could swear his voice could rival thunder. Hailee Steinfeld shines as Gwen, blending her previous roles into a cocktail of awesomeness. And let's not forget Moore, who's simply ""freaking amazing"" as Morales, showcasing maturity and immaturity in a way that would make even a hormonal spider proud. The storytelling is as fresh as a spider web spun by a hipster arachnid, blending nostalgia, comedy, and superheroism in a way that leaves you saying, ""Wow, superheroes can be deep and funny!"" The comedy is a riot, hitting you with more punchlines than a spider web has sticky threads, and the nostalgia and Easter eggs are like a treasure hunt for cinephiles and comic book aficionados. The action scenes are a step up from the first film, delivering more kicks, flips, and whips than a salsa dancing Spider-Man. The animation and art style are a visual feast, like watching a kaleidoscope of comic book pages come to life in a mind-bending acid trip. Sure, there are a few hiccups along the way, like some forced humor and moments of pacing hiccups, but hey, nobody's perfect, not even Spider-Man. The ending may drag on a bit, like that one friend who can't take a hint to leave the party, but it's still a wild ride that'll make you want to spin back for more. So grab your popcorn, slip into your Spidey suit, and get ready for an adventure that'll make you laugh, cheer, and leave you itching for the next installment. Spider-fans, this one's for you!",

It's not the masterpiece that the insane hype train would have you believe, but it's very good. As of right now, this movie has a higher IMDb score than some of the greatest movies of all time (Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, all the Lord of the Rings movies) and I don't really think it's deserved. I'm sure it will be a lot better to look back on once part two comes out, but as of right now it does feel like half of a movie. The animation and voice acting are both great, it has good action, and some of the references and visual gags were cool. I would recommend seeing this in the theater, but I'd say wait a few weeks. I saw it opening weekend in a theater packed full of drooling fanboys who cheered at every single reference. It was maybe the worst theater experience I've ever had.

I would've sat there for another 2 hours just to see how this story is going to end, and what else they could've done with this art style. My booty would've been sore, but my mind would've been a happy camper! If you do decide to see this, which you 100% should (it may be the best film of the year, but still too early to tell), see it in the IMAX format.

Doubly sad because it's also not actually very good. The conceptualisation behind the hybrid styles of animation is spectacular and executed in an highly polished fashion - as you'd expect. The story is all over the pace though, and the proliferation of Spidey's seemed designed more to allow the narrative to become more culturally inclusive (and bankable) rather than to develop any meaningful characterisations. What personas there are spend their time wallowing in a mire of unrequited and/or confused familial love, or teenage angst more suitable in a soap. The dialogue has it's moments - assuming you can catch it - and there's a bit of humour to be found but I found the audio mix made following all that was said became a bit wearisome after a first hour that really does depend on your having watched (and remembering) the first - in my view far better - instalment. This whole ""multiverse"" theme can keep on recycling itself ad nauseam but if the writing remains at this unremarkable level then I'm not sure I'll be bothering with the next set of repetitively set-piece adventures for ""Miles"" and his parents, love interest and fellow Spider-folk.",

But it also overwhelms and saturates a viewer who is not prepared for what they are going to see in 140 minutes. The visual style and the animation concepts have been reinterpreted from the first film. I don't think there's an improvement, because I'm just seeing a reshuffling of what's on offer in Into the Spider-Verse, which, to be honest, is pretty hard to top something that redefined the genre so recently. So in that light, this sequel maintains its great visual quality. The new samples are masterfully displayed, being a delight to look at.

I knew going into this movie the action and story were going to probably be better than the first. What I didn't know was that I was walking into one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. And that goes for both live action and animated films. From the moment it started to end I was hooked. The story was funny, dramatic, and enjoyable in a way that made me feel like the characters and story was actually real. And not just some mundane made up sci-fi story that's already been told a thousand times. By the end of the movie I was left wanting to see more, which for some movies is a bad thing, but for this movie I was only wanting more cause of how great everything I saw was.

113,1 June 2023,gbanoon,10, Surpassed my expectations,Without spoiling anything I just want to give a brief summary about this movie and how it is mindblowingly good.,
114,5 June 2023,ambitionsar,9, In a class of it's own.,"This movie is a masterclass in visuals with phenomenal story telling, great character foucus & emotional beats it's quipy but in my opinion those quips don't get in the way of any serious emotional moments or feel out of place. It's well paced, in fact it feels like it's moving at ""break neck"" speeds especially during the action sequences, it definitely in my opinion doesn't feel like the 2hr + run-time that it has. The voice acting as well is phenomenal hailee Steinfeld has always been amazing at that just look at Arcane, Oscar Isaac is great as well, as it to be expected. In my opinion this is one of the greatest sequels of all time and if they stick the landing with the 3rd installment then they'll have one the greatest trilogies in movie history on there hands. Understandably some critics are a bit dissatisfied with the cliff hanger ending, but considering the next movie is just a year away it's fine with me. Depending on how the next movie turns out I may comeback and change my score to a 10.",

The film pulls you in with the crispiest animation images I've seen on the big screen - you seriously cannot watch this on a home TV screen to give it justice. Beautiful colours and sequences it leaves you in awe. The score and soundtrack is amazing and is like the glue that binds the images together and feels very much part of the feel and story - not just some random celeb hits added as an afterthought.",

Hands down the best movie ive ever watched in theatre. And maybe the best marvel movie too. Coming from a die hard DC fan ive enjoyed every single second of this movie. Visually its just marvellous. The animation style is unique. Even better than the first one. Story, tone, phasing , comedy and emotional weight is perfectly balanced. Last but not least the MUSIC. The music gave me literal chills all the way through. Ive never heard that much great music in any other comic based movie. Just perfect . Next thing is all the homage to old spidey movies, cartoons and comic books. Just well done. I hope one day ill be lucky enough to see a DC animated movie as good as this. Cant wait to see the next part.",

You can't see it when it comes out on streaming or DVD. See it in theaters it is worth the money. This is better than Spider-Man No Way Home too. This is the best Spider-Man movie ever. This movie also has great character development and just does everything right so yeah if you see this review go watch the movie.,
119,3 June 2023,cadillac20,10, It's Everything The First One Was And More,"Can't rave enough about this movie. Everything was excellent and I have nothing I can think of to complain about. It was a joy to be back, hanging out with Miles, Gwen, Peter, and the handful of new characters. The film takes it's time early on developing Gwen and Miles as they live their separate lives in their respective dimensions and deal with the frustrations and realities of being their own Spider persons. We're immediately given the emotional weight of Gwen's life, one that is very lonely and who has seemingly lost the only friend she had left after having to say goodbye to Miles. Miles is in a similar predicament, though he is less hung up on being alone and missing Gwen, and more so on having to balance school, his responsibilities to his parents, and his role as Spider-Man.",
120,3 June 2023,sktraut,9, Almost Perfect,"This movie had me hooked from the very beginning. Already I could tell that the animation was going to be unparalleled by almost any other animated movie. The style and the colors give this movie a completely unique feel - even when compared to the first movie. They've upped their game in almost every department. The story is more interesting and is more than just Miles becoming spider-man and saving the day, kind of like the first movie was. The movie is funny and the attention to detail is crazy - there are countless blink-and-you'll-miss-it jokes that are often completely visual and require no dialogue. It makes the movie instantly rewatchable. However I couldn't stand the ending of the movie. It felt like it went on too long to leave enough content for part 3, yet not long enough to have a satisfying conclusion. However, when the story is completed next year, watching part 2 and 3 together, as one long movie, may remedy this. This movie was so good though that they could've just combined both of them into a 4 hour movie and most everyone, the adults at least, wouldn't have complained.",

123,1 June 2023,alensufli,7, A Miles Morales film without Miles Morales,"It may surprise you but this film and Last of Us the show are very similar in terms of having the soul purpose to serve only the geeky-fans. No doubt that Spider-geeks will be appreciate this self-indulgence, they are sure to spend hours rewatching and pausing it to catalogue all of the many allusions to six decades' worth of comics, cartoons, live-action films and video games. Non-geeks are just getting confused. Whereas, Into the Spider-verse was referring to almost everyone who just love our beloved web-slinger. There are so many cameos that overwhelm you at some point. We also cannot see Miles until almost an hour after the film starts. Wheel-spinningly slow long conversations, overbloated character presentations stole the time from our Miles. The Spot, despite being the principal villain, is absent for much of it. But the most flagrant example of the film's excesses is that, even though it's nearly two-and-a-half hours long, it only gets halfway through its story. Despite all these issues I can say I am satisfied at the end. Miles had a brilliantly written character arc even though for the most part his journey was shadowed by other's stories. It ends on a cliffhanger, and a caption announces that Miles will return in a further instalment, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse. No wonder it feels more exhausting than exhilarating.",

This movie takes itself to next level and excels in animation, story telling, characters and so much more. I kind of didn't like the cliffhanger at first but after a rewatch and really letting it sink in I think this was the best cliffhanger I have seen since Arcane. I had a lot of expectations for this movie and lemme tell you it exceeds in ever single thing. The movie starts off a bit slow but then it just keeps on pumping up the level till the very last frame of the movie. This might have the chance to be the greatest trilogy of all time.

Miles Morales returns in this sequel facing dilemmas that we can easily relate to in real life. I find it exceptional that the production is building a story with such emotional depth, which, by the way, is already a characteristic of Spider-Man.

Secondly i love how each character had their own small part in the movie and i loved every single character that was shown on screen especially Hobie Brown.

I was also expecting more of Pavitr and Punk, also there was literally no Noire which made me sad. I honestly feel sad after watching the movie, I was waiting for it to end by the time intermission ended. I watched it in 4d and I honestly don't know what to say, it was meh.

Morbius' trailer thankfully hid the parts about him morbing so it could be a surprise. Every event in this trailer happens in the first 10 minutes of the movie. After that the chai comes. Spiderman india is the hero of this movie. He introduces the chai tea or should I say tea tea, and he is the one who saves the day. There are so many jokes about Chai and it is very dramatic when miles drowns in Chai. Some of the jokes can be very rude to chai lovers. Its all in good fun though. Luckily one spiderverse bought spiderman india's chai and they all said chai tea at the same time. It annoyed the Chai monster villain who knew they were saying tea tea. While he was distracted spidermanindia drank him. Like how lego dimensions is the best lego game spiderman spiderverse is the best movie. I cant wait for morb. I also had got some chai tea while i was watching the movie. I love chai tea. I was very insulted at some parts despite the positives, but luckily I had chai to keep me entertained. I love chai. The actual story was definitly lacking however. I also think a lot of the themes could have been handled better. Miles should have probably gotten more focus which I wasn't thinking about before because I love chai. I actually would not recommend this movie. You should only see this movie if you love chai and you are drinking it while watching the movie. Actually don't watch the movie at all because it will insult any chai lovers out there. Overall following a great first movie, unfortunatly the sequel was very bad. Writing review is my passion.",

Needless to say that he will not be seeing the next installment. Following this movie, we then saw Fast and Furious X, which was also an unadvertised two parter.

Nothing introduced in this story is resolved, but beyond that the content isn't even good to begin with. 80% of this movie is a generic young adult coming-of-age story. If you want to see a teenager struggling with his future, parents, grades, and girls then I'd recommend watching any one of the countless movies that do it better.

My issue with this film was the plot. This film has essentially 3 plot lines, and I think it should have just focused on 1. All 3 of these plot lines would have been great on their own and could have been used for their own film. I could have watched an entire film about how Miles and Gwen are both struggling to balance being super heroes while maintaining a relationship with their families. I could have also watched an entire film about Spot starting off as a joke and ending up as a formidable force with themes of revenge and retribution. I also would have been happy with just a story about the conflict between Miles and Miguel. Unfortunately, I think that the choice to combine all 3 of these plot lines really weakened each individual plot and ultimately led to some pacing issues.",

The soundtrack is remarkable and sticks to the mind, the voice work of the actors is magnificent and the final result of the edition is a visual delight.

I did noticed the similarity of the concept between Rick and Morty and the trailer of this movie, however, since I'm also fan of first one, I decided to give it a go. It's gotta be different at some level, right? Boy, it was really more than ""adopting"" or ""borrowing"" the theme. It's a blatant copy and paste. I'm pretty sure people who didn't watch or know about Rick and Morty would be fascinated by this movie, but for the Rick and Morty fans, it was really cringe-worthy.",

It took forever to spin the story, meaning the first 2 hours of the movie were pretty much unnecessary and then because it took so long to get to the point it stops abruptly and leaves you hanging. All this hype about the animation and VFX are crap. Yeah maybe it felt like living in a comic book at times but it didn't cut it for me. Believe characters someone said. Are you kidding me? What 15 year olds do you know that are out saving the universe. The only believable characters were the ones who weren't the super heros. This is the same old same old story. The bad guy reveals himself and the good guy is out to stop him. Tosing in a few complications like crossing multi universes doesn't make it better and it's been done before. Sometimes successfully sometimes not so much. This time not so much. Honestly if this is the future of animation and super hero movies it will be my last.

I think back to the 1st film. Before the film started I asked myself HOW? HOW in the hell is SONY going to top the 1st entry to Miles. We know SONY has mishandled their Spidey IP in the live action department with a few given exceptions...So as I watched Gwen's story pulled LITERALLY from the comics to big screen & watched Spider-India, Spider-Punk with a twist,Scarlet Spider & the PLETHORA of Spidey characters in all its MAGNIFICENCE hit the screen. At the end of the film I answered my own question...THIS!..THIS IS HOW THEY DO IT! & I'll be damned, they SURELY did. The various art animation styles, the color palette usage, when they focused on each specific Spidey character at the time. The story arc being told & arcs they pulled from, with that creme de la creme twist myself & my son picked out once we saw Mile's mom face & knew immediately where they were going...perfection...left you begging for more. You could've told me to sit there for another 2 1/2 hrs & I would have not mind AT ALL. Knowing ahead of time this was always a 2 part film already had me excited, EVEN MORE after that ending. The group that was assembled towards the end my my my goodness. The gems of Easter eggs ontop of Easter eggs & other get you amped up surprises. At its core it had its drama & deep family story to tell, it had action, it had comedy it had suspense, it had it all, but 1st & foremost, the CORE concepts of what makes Spider-Man..Spider-Man, were showcased through & through. You can tell from the director, down to every single person/department involved with these 2 films well 3 😏hopefully soon thoroughly love the character/characters.",

Obviously it's been a long wait for the sequel and I had high expectations. This one felt very long, especially as it is only half a story. The film ends on a cliffhanger and felt totally unresolved, it also felt unexpected and abrupt. I also struggled a bit with the animation, where each character was animated in a different style it often felt very chaotic and a bit messy and at times was almost blurry, parts looked like watching a 3D movie without the glasses. I look forward to the next instalment and the plot being resolved, maybe I will feel differently then.",

The biggest standout is its absolutely breathtaking yet somehow seamless blending of a wide variety of animation and filmmaking styles. So many frames of this film are truly jaw-dropping (particularly the scenes involving Gwen and The Spot, which look like they came from an art museum at points), but the film isn't just a pretty face. The wide cast of characters, both new and from the previous films, are a delight to follow, with Miles, Gwen, and Spider-Punk being the true standouts, with their respective voice actors doing a great job as well. The story and humor are equally as strong as the first film, but this film further explores what it means to be Spider-Man and how we find our place in a complex, messy world. Furthermore, Daniel Pemberton's score is absolutely phenomenal again and Metro Boomin's original music is a welcome addition as well. I truly cannot praise this film enough and everyone involved, from the directors and writers to the animators and story boarders. We need more of this in both animation and Hollywood in general, and I truly cannot wait til Beyond the Spider-Verse comes out next year.

Before I start, let me say that I will criticize the movie completely in comparison with the previous movie. If we start with the animation style, which is one of the most prominent details of the first movie: These guys are really breaking new ground in art design with each movie. Even though the animation style used in this movie is the same as in the first movie, in the first movie's scenario, spider men from other universes came to Miles' universe, but this time Miles goes to other universes. Each new universe we see has its own unique drawing style and theme. Even if this is an extremely beautiful detail, I have to say that it is tiring for the eyes. Ahem, if we talk about the script, the script of this movie is a script that will be completed with the sequel, but if we evaluate the part up to this point: While the first movie told a more personal story, in this movie we experience a large-scale, multifaceted story that affects all universes. In short, it's a great movie that really pushed the limits, that made me in crisis as to where I could break points, and since the movie has a very fast pace, you can be sure that I will watch it again or even several times that I may have missed. I kiss the hands of everyone who contributed to this movie and offer my endless respect.",

The style had changed from the original and it just doesn't reach prequels levels (at any point). The story still doesn't begin. Nothing happens and we see Morales' new enemy who just doesn't fit to the movie at all.

The first Spider-verse movie redefined what we can expect from an animated movie, and the latest chapter somehow took it another level. The art? Unlike anything I have seen before. The story? Almost like a deconstruction of comic book stories. I was completely enamored from the first scene, and the 140 minute runtime practically flew by.

The animation is a little bit different from into the spider verse and showing all of the different universes in different kinds of animation And I love how they showed that. 2. The scene with Miguel showing miles what happened to all of the Spider-Man's loved ones dying and him messing up and that whole chase scene was really fantastic. I really think the whole ending part with miles accidentally going to the wrong universe and that universe miles being the prowler and Gwen having to look for miles and ready for the stuff she's going to go through.

""Across the Spider-Verse"" is undeniably the best CBM of 2023, its not even close(taste of all mid af cbms like gotg3,antman3 and shazam 2 is washed away) thanks to its exceptional characters, a compelling storyline, emotional depth, and a cliffhanger that leaves us hungry for more. Spider-Punk, with his rebellious spirit and unique punk-inspired appearance, brings a fresh and exciting energy to the story. Pavitr Prabhakar, the Spider-Man of India. His presence not only expands the Spider-Verse but also adds depth to the story as what canon is what is supposed to happen and what is not in the spiderverse. Ben Rileytake on the Spider-Man mythology. Spider-Gwen to impress with her dynamic and empowering portrayal. Her qrelatable vulnerabilities, and growth as a hero make her an incredibly likable and compelling character and her journey is quiet great in the movie. Of course, the heart of the story remains with Miles Morales, whose growth as a hero continues to impress. Miles' journey of self-discovery, responsibility, and finding his own voice within the Spider-Verse is masterfully portrayed. His relatability, vulnerability, and undeniable charm make him a character that audiences genuinely care about and root for. Peter B. Parker in ""Across the Spider-Verse"" not only shines as a hero but also as a great husband, mentor, and father figure. His portrayal as a loving and supportive husband to Mary Jane Watson, and as a caring mentor and father figure to Mayday Parker, is truly commendable. Together, these characters form a rich tapestry that sparks genuine emotional investment from viewers. Their individual arcs and interactions create a dynamic ensemble that balances moments of humor, heart, and intense action.

I like the real people blended inside the animation as well, those were pretty funny. Unfortunately, I think the negatives of this film outweigh its positives. The whole ""multiverse universe"" thing is getting pretty boring and outplayed especially for superhero movies. Additionally, I did not understand if the film was trying to portray Miguel as the bad guy. He is trying to literally stop Miles from destroying his entire universe/family out of pride that ""I can do anything I'm Spiderman"". Miguel seemed rational compared to Miles and I did not view him as villainous. I am going to predict that for the third movie, they are going to make Miles win over Miguel and the spot.

But after 4 years of waiting it was worth it to see Miles and Gwen and Peter. And there is just so much in the movie and I wish it didn't end when it did. You have SO MANY great characters such as The Spot and Spider Punk. Every single moment is special and amazing and I will be looking forward too the Beyond the Spider-Verse.

240,4 June 2023,The_Coffee_Frog,10, A Perfect Continuation to a Landmark Piece of Animation.,"I have been a Spider-Man fan pretty much my entire life, and I never felt like an adaption of the character met its full potential: I loved the Rami films, but even those are imperfect, the 'Amazing' series has a great lead in Garfield, but ultimately feel soulless and the MCU ones feel a little too bogged down into fitting into that series' cannon and feels even more soulless than the 'Amazing' films. So, I thought, that this character's future would lay solely in mediocrity with MCU, until Sony Pictures Animation, who, bar a few examples, are masters in mediocrity, released 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' in 2018, and changed everything: this film was not only a landmark for comic book filmmaking, but also the entire medium of animation as a whole. I feel in love this film the moment I saw it, I was aware of the Spider-Verse storyline from the comics, but this film elevates it and its lead, Miles Morales, into legacy status. This film wasn't only a perfect Spider-Man film, but a perfect film period. This acclaim lead to two sequels announced, the first of which, 'Across the Spider-Verse' has finally released.",

What I like about most of this film is it's storyline the way writer has written it it's just phenomal. It's not an easy job to write a multiverse type of stories in which you had to put so much characters and you've to give space to each characters to justify their role in the film. This is my first time that I've seen so many Spiderman in just one frame and it's so satisfyitto watch that scene on a big screen.,
255,3 June 2023,ITALUKE,9, A Breathtaking Animated Adventure with mutiple Spider-Man.,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an extraordinary animated film that perfectly captures the essence of the Spider-Man character in all its forms. Without revealing any spoilers, I can confidently say that this movie is a visual and narrative triumph that will leave viewers mesmerized and craving for more. The animation in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is simply stunning. The vibrant colors, the creative use of different animation techniques, and the breathtaking visual effects make each scene an moving work of art. The way the film plays with dimensions and different Spider-Man universes is absolutely genius and provides a unique visual experience unlike anything seen before. But it's not just the visuals that make it outstanding. The story is engaging and well-crafted, keeping you glued to the screen from start to finish. The characters are well-developed and captivating, each with their own unique backstory and personality. The soundtrack is an energetic mix of songs that perfectly fit the film's atmosphere. One of the strengths of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is its humor. The well-timed jokes and comedic moments are cleverly sprinkled throughout the entire movie, providing genuine laughs without ever compromising the tension or emotion of the more intense moments. Furthermore, the film tackles deep and universal themes such as identity, courage, and responsibility, adding another layer of depth to the characters and making them even more relatable and compelling. I cannot fail to mention the voice cast, which is simply outstanding. Each actor delivers a impactful performance and fits their character perfectly. The voices convey authentic emotions, bringing the characters to life and giving them depth and complexity. While Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse may seem like a sequel, the film manages to maintain a sense of freshness and originality, offering the audience something new and surprising. It is a work that will captivate both long-time Spider-Man fans and those who are new to this universe. In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an extraordinary cinematic experience that exceeds expectations. It is an innovative animated film, filled with action, emotion, and humor that will leave audiences thrilled and eager to discover what the future holds for Spider-Man. Whether you love superheroes or simply well-crafted films, this is an absolute must-see. Rating: 9 out of 10.",

Call me old, but the weird mix of nicely extended emotional dialogues and ultrafast MTV style shots with constantly changing drawing style inside those short takes was hard to take in. The film is fully stuffed with fan service and feels like an extra long promotional film for spiderman merchandising. Sony explicitly advertises the second part beyond the universe with the cliffhanger at the end of the film. The attention span of people decreases more and more. It works very well when the congenial images are in the foreground and are meaningful enough. The film has strikingly many similarities to how advertising works.",

That movie did the multiverse better than any of Marvel's live action movies. Now Across the Spider-Verse surpasses its predecessor. The visuals take a little getting used to but they really fit the story. The stories and the voice acting is stellar.

I am well versed in comics, and the mcu, fox, and sony movies. If you are interested in watching this movie, or someone you know is interested and you care about what you watch for the time being. I implore you to watch another movie. This is not for the people that care about a plot or the story. If I am being honest with you, there are so many branches of the story that you would need a story map to take tabs on what plot you are currently watching. This is a literal web of stories, and there are parts that are not kept together so well. If you are watching to matter socially, and you are not interested in the story whatsoever then by all means go ahead. Get your likes on whatever social media platform you use for watching. If you thought the last one was great, well this one is a sequel. With all due respect, this is not a good one. There are a few parts of the movie where there are no lines or actual storytelling. It's just them moving to a soundtrack for minutes. The art is phenomenal at some points in the movie, at some points it's fuzzy, blurry, or just garbage to be truthful. When this comes out on streaming or disc, it is not your device. It is the movie. The backgrounds for different universes are all different, and some are rushed to the point it looks like a bad tv screen idle loop. Some points are fantastic, and some are so bad I believe in the future people will make fun of us who said this movie was considered a movie. I don't mean to be harsh, but I feel like this movie had alterior motives. This is a review, so I will warn you that all the cameos are forced beyond recognition. If you have no clue who any of these characters are, then I guarantee you that you will not get many puns or memes during this. Its not jokes like comedy. They are cameos forced to try to fill in the role of being funny. Wow a character is in this movie. The entire audience reacts as if they are watching something interesting on their phone. I guess it is just not for me. This movie is for one kind of social group, and if you find this movie really interesting, very funny, heart poundingly good, and in any way a must watch again, movie of the year. You are one of that social group. I am not, and I know many people who are not that will find this a movie to take naps too or change. Save yourself some time if you have more important things to do. This is a 5 for me since I am a fan of the original content, and seeing some scenes that make some kind of point come to life made it a little worth watching.",

The art styles and effects from the first move were already great but this stepped it up big-time, with new styles used specifically just for certain characters or their universes and the colors and art matching with emotions, it amazed me.

I thought this movie was going to be better than the first one, but it's actually true that it is better than the first one because there are a lot of Spiderman in the universe, like a cat and plushie Spiderman and Spiderman 2099 (Miguel O' Hara) and even the dinosaurs.

286,3 June 2023,himonsonowal,9," It's a Spider-Man movie, people will flock to theatres anyway.","The highly anticipated sequel to the Oscar-winning movie doesn't let the audience down when it comes to its animation. Spider-Punk stands out among the new characters introduced and feels like he has much more to offer in the upcoming sequel, along with the villain of the movie Spot. Oscar Isaac's Miguel O'hara is a complete menace and almost feels like a different character from his introduction in the first part, which played out for the sack of memes. The soundtrack is so well curated that it might even surpass the original one. Shout out to Metro Boomin, and look out for his cameo. Does this follow-up surpass the original one? I will say no; the origin of Miles still remains one of the best introductions to any character in a movie. But it's a complete fanfest filled with Easter eggs, which only New Rockstars can breakdown for you. The return of Nic Cage's Spider Noir band with the likes of Pavitra Pravakar and Hobi Brown excites me for the final arc of the story. With the level of Easter eggs Sony was able to pull up for this movie, a man can only dream about the possibilities the next part has to offer.",

311,7 June 2023,Pairic,9, A Web Of Worlds,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse: Another triumph of storytelling and varying animation styles across the Spider-Verse, Gwen Stacey, Spider-Woman is still having problems with her police captain dad and after she reveals her identity to him she has to flee across the verse and reconnect with Miles Morales the Teen Spider-Man of his Earth. She joins in his pursuit of Spot, a super-Villain created due to Miles' destruction of the Alchemax collider in the previous film. Spot's creation story is rendered in blacklined on white animation. Miles has problems with his own police captain father, indeed such problems are a common occurrence. In Mumbatten, wonderfully rendered in Mobius style where the Spider-Man is Pavitr Prabhakar, his love interest's father is also a police officer. They are joined in their struggles by Spider-Punk, Hobart Brown, an agitprop, collage style web spinner. As the plot thickens we learn of Canon events which must take place across the Spider-Verse and a few of the characters are withholding information from the others. And there;s also the Guardians of the Spider-Verse: the Spider Society. A host of spider folk including Spider-Cat; Web-Slinger, compete with masked horse; even a Spider-Therapist to mention just a few. The breadth of vision here is awe-inspiring as it incorporates every medium in which a form of a spider person has been portrayed. A stand out in animation background colouring is in the palette used when Gwen is arguing with her father, their changing moods influencing the colour schemes which adapt from moment to moment. A story of family connections, love and obsession. Enormously entertaining. Directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers and Justin K. Thompson from a screenplay written by Phil Lord, Christopher Miller and David Callaham. 8.5/10.",

In this movie and the last spider-man movie ( No Way Home ) they focus on the pain and suffering of the character through the years of his work and that's so meaningful because what makes spider-man a relatable character is the story and the events that changes his life and they mention those events with so much pain that you experience those pains again and again in your head and you wonder why the man is so helpless and in that moment you have a very straight connection with the character because all those pains and story lines that you experienced and broke your heart is the strong connection that you have with the character.,

The influx of animation styles and the way they incorporate together into one cohesive story feels absolutely impossible, resulting in the most beautiful palette of visuals I've ever seen in an animated film. Since 1962 the character of Spider-Man has endured quite an array of challenges and circumstances in stories that feel completely disconnected from one another, however, the critical moments that link every comic, tv show, video game, and movie to each other is what lies at the heart of this emotionally complex story.

About an hour of the film was just about miles just being spiderman then finally when Gwen shows up it starts to move at a better pace. We see all the other spider people which was cool. The cameos where sick especially Andrew and Spectacular spiderman. I think the Spot is a really bad stupid villian which should have been in the film more and should've been more serious.

This was much much better than it's predecessor and that's saying something as that was amazing. I seriously recommend watching this movie if you haven't already and I would be lying if I hadn't had superhero fatigue from the mediocre movies we've been getting recently but man this was truly epic, and not only is this one of the best superhero movies ever but one of the best movies ever made (in my opinion).",

They do nail the multiverse and different worlds well but this could have been done in a much tighter timeframe.

The artistic direction/cinematography of the sequel just flowed flawlessly in every frame. The special effects were wonderful. The music just like in the first movie was amazing. The voice acting was SPOT-ON. Get it haha?! And my favorite character was definitely Miguel O'Hara AKA Spider-Man 2099! Miguel O'Hara was the MVP of this sequel IMO and Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse is gonna SLAP HARD AF!",

""Across the Spider-Verse"" surpassed the first movie, with its scale, characters, drawing, staging, and plot. I had a feeling that I'm watching a movie with real actors, their feelings and development on a high level. Songs are going to make you dance, be nervous and enjoy every moment! I can say that there are many protagonists in the movie except Miles. And there are things that happening on the screen which can be questionable for you)) Spider-Punk is going to grab your heart for sure and give you all the freedom :)",

Spider-Verse had already revolutionized 3D animation for good with its first installation, yet it STILL managed to outdo itself. The various art styles were so deliberate and purposeful to the characters and settings they were portraying. It never felt confusing or impractical because each art style was there to match what was happening in the story. The color-changing, paint-like style to demonstrate the mood shifts and uneasiness between Gwen Stacy and her father. The dadaist/avant-garde style to depict Hobie Brown's free and lawless nature. Etc.",

Of course, there are places in the film that I don't like, for example, it seemed ridiculous to me that Miles Morale couldn't be caught by a bunch of Spiderman, and I couldn't warm up to the character of Gwen But apart from these, the other aspects of the film have shown that the effort has been spent on the film to the end, and I will wait until next year it ends with a very good ending for the next film.",

They didnt only used all the naimation styles and techniques there are, but they went as far as inventing new ones just for this movie, you levae the theather with no words after the movie. With that said, the animation is obviously its strongest point but the story is another hit, it is almost just as good as the first one, buuuut, the one thing I find more weird than anything is the ending, I understand that it is divided in 2 parts and everything but it just made me feel empty, and not empty like when youre doing something you really like and then its over, more like just incomplete, I guess watching the 2nd part it will make more sense and be better and my 9 could potentially transform into a 10 but for now, only and for that feeling of incompliteness alone I give this a 9, but everything else in this movie is a 10.",

Next on the list was the soundtrack witch I will admit was not as good as the first but between the score and the Metro Boomin album the music was almost perfect. I think this movie did a magnificent job on its pacing from humor to emotion and had so much amazing character development between Miles and Gwen. But the best part of it is the ending which I won't spoil but I will say no one in the theater saw it coming. I was completely in awe watching this and seeing how it almost perfectly resembled a comic book as good or better than the first one.,

From the web slinging, to the skylines shots, to the lighthearted this movie is a tribute to the legendary comics created by Stan lee. If you ever imagined what a live comic book would look like it would be this. This is 100% the best comic book movie ever made. I'm not saying it's the best super hero movie per se but in terms of bringing a comic book to life this movie has done it better than all the rest. All the story lines made sense and the drama and action were on point. Do your self a favor and watch this! Way better than the first one as well can't wait to see what else is in store.",

The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece.",

Don't know why a cartoon needs at least 5-6 of those moments eating up what 20-30 min of solid drama. I mean drama is important, it builds the emotion and makes the action stand out. But come on.

This sequel improved upon so many aspects of the original, reflecting that the creators genuinely took audience feedback into account. My expectations were utterly surpassed; this is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's a rare delight to find such an easy-to-watch, yet amazing movie - those two qualities often don't coexist. Even as someone who is notoriously picky about the movies I watch, this one gets my approval on all fronts.

362,4 June 2023,Dello_,9," An artistic masterpiece, but it's a part one of two","""Across the Spider-Verse"" is a phenomenal movie and something that was never seen before. This statement is not exaggerated in any way or form since the animation styles and how they are used to enhance scenes are unprecedented. I recently saw again its predecessor (""Into the Spider-Verse"") and the step up in terms of art and budget is very noticeable. If the first one was still creative and innovative while translating a comic into a movie, this one is the same but under steroids. This is because the animation style changes between the various universes but most importantly it changes with the emotions of the characters, it follows and enhances dialogues being able to enrich many interactions between characters. Only because of its artistic nature I think this movie deserves a watch in the best theatre you know.",
363,4 June 2023,freethinkingworld,8, After Thoughts,"Wow! I was shocked with how close this was to being on par with the first Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse. I was wanting to see if they would do anything interesting with the animation, and oh boy did they. I felt like the animators read my mind and pretty much said ""Hold My Beer"" cause it might actually be more beautiful than the first! Especially that water color look of Gwen's world and how it reacts to her emotions and situations. I was also pleasantly surprised by the amount of love put into Spider-Man I'm general. They really went all out in trying to pay as much respect to every thing Spider-Man as possible. Also they did not skip a beat with the soundtrack either! It's Fire 🔥! The only thing I had to say in any sort of negative way was the record scratch of a cliff hanger ending it had. I went and saw it early and wanted to go in completely blind so I had no idea it would end abruptly as it did. That kind of left it on a sour note for me. Like I never had a whole theater erupt in groans and exasperation like that before. I'm not so upset now, but I won't lie it bummed me out a bit. I also don't know if they'll have a lot for whole other movie too, but we'll see I guess 🤷",
364,4 June 2023,sewalker-12265,9, Wow really cool,"I thought this movie was really amazing. The animation is stellar, the story line is great and the dialogue keeps you thinking the whole time. It actually has a sensical plot too (I find most multiverse movies to not be logical). I think it had great character development as well. It's not really geared towards kids though, more like teenagers and up. My son is 8 and he told me at one point there is too much talking and some of the jokes are a little over his head. He loved the movie though, the action scenes are great. My daughter who is 6 did not enjoy it though again I think too much dialogue for her attention span. I definitely recommend this movie. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I feel they are dragging it a little bit so they can get a second movie out of it. But it was still a real joy and unique movie to watch.",

And what can I say about the jaw dropping entries. Every charecter got a worthy entry which made the audience shout and clap with joy. Background score was superb loved everyone of them blended perfectly and more than that made their scenes better. The story felt much more mature than the first one giving many of the charecters development. My new favourite comic book movie surely. The only bad thing is I have watched it. Wish I could see it for the first time again. Cannot wait for the sequel.",

Each world is unique and masterfully presented. There is meaningful character development. There is a cliff hanger and a can't wait for third movie. Somehow they made this sequel more original and an original movie. Before this film I disliked the multiverse because with an infinite multi-verse that means there is an infinite number of Spider-Man and an infinite number of every single person. Because of that, it felt kind of meaningless but here they managed to show the unique Spider-Man from every single Multiverse, and each Spider-Man matters just like each of us matter. Masterfully done.",

Spider-Man Across The Spider-Verse is yet another beautifully and stunning visuals alongside with the greatest script that keeps carrying the story and breaks the boundaries of the Modern PG movie nowadays. The characters are so damn good and well written that actually makes you feel the characters struggle in this movie despite seeing them as a fictional characters. With so much emotional moments, great cameos and a lot of stuff that I can't catch up to describe. I would love to say from the bottom of my heart and being honest to say that this officiallt became my favourite animated and Spider-Man movie of all time!

372,3 June 2023,wrenschaalje,6, I have mixed feelings about this...,Okay so first of all: 1000/10 on the animation. That was probably the best animated movie I've ever seen. But the story line didn't make a lot of sense and was very chaotic. It has so many ideas and most of them were... Okay but trying to put all of them in one movie? That's quite the challenge. And u didn't really love Gwen's backstory. It didn't make a whole lot of sense to me and I feel like the movie would've been a bit better off without it. And making two parts made it feel like a TV show which didn't sit well with me. I feel like Spider Man Across the Spiderverse should have been it. I did not like the fact that a sequel was created. Or a triquel.,

Ran out of words after watching it. It's completely an art on the big screen without any doubts. You can't look away from the screen for a second. This movie is in another level of animation now.

375,2 June 2023,josevaep,8, A Mind-Blowing Cinematic Unleashing the Eccentricity of Spider-Man,"This film is a jaw-dropping marvel, featuring unrivaled uniqueness and stunning visuals that redefine the boundaries of animation. The characters are introduced in such depth that we can really feel their every emotion. The portrayal of Spot, a sympathetic but deeply annoying antagonist whose motives may seem foolish, his universal menace is undeniably threatening. I applaud the bold decision to cast Spot as the character Vallian for being both refreshing and fun, blending comedy with an eccentric style. Basically he looks like a cow or something, his story is still innovative and refreshing. And let's not forget the stunning Spider-Man 2099 exudes a never-before-seen coolness reminiscent of vampire allure and plus there's 280 Spider-Man in it and it's awesome!!! But wait a minute, I just don't know the names of all of them, so sorry for the trouble, we'll be waiting for you to find out for yourself. But the ending is a little frustrating because the fight between Spider-Man and Spot hasn't happened yet, even after years of waiting for us to be shown something like Inception. Even so, the film is an extraordinary experience, offering something completely new. The only drawback lies in the ending. Hopefully in the next 10 months, we'll witness a spectacular battle between Spider-Man and Spot. Despite these flaws, I wholeheartedly admire this film. This is phenomenal!!!",

Maybe too big and hyper-stimulated, but the pace is calibrated to perfection, savoring every step of the way. It builds on the visual and narrative style of the first film with mountains of confidence and ambition. It's absolutely inmune to toxic wokism, no character here is disrespected, and various cultures are featured very naturally, latinos, indians, british...

Perfect cliffhanger ending that sets up part 2 amazingly. Can't wait to see beyond the spider verse. Felt really bad for miles throughout the film and has the right to feel betrayed.

Not just the animation (which is by far the best animation you have ever seen on screen till now without a doubt) but the entire storyline and concept was amazing as well(the fact that everything now is due to an accident of the past basically makes no one a villain). Gwen is best female character of all the spiderman movies ever made and her 1st appearance sequence is enough to get you to the character and aesthetic beauty that the movie is going to serve you. Miles is obviously fascinating to watch alongwith his parents especially his mother having crucial moments with him . THe music was the only thing which although was good but due to other factors being outstanding, will feel a bit lagging( If only it had busters like Sunflower and Whats up danger). Every other thing is better than the previous movie which itself shows what a masterpiece it is and that also sets the bar way too high for Beyond the Spiderverse.

I'm not talking about a complete movie, with plenty of room for a sequel like the first one. I am talking about a 4-5 hour story, broken up in 2 parts and released a year apart. Some don't even have 4-5 hours of material, they just stretch out each movie so they can make it 2 movies. Even if you make one story a 2 part event, spaced a year apart, at least conclude the movie you set up. Don't make the first of a 2 part movie be all setup, and raised stakes, and then just end it on a cliffhanger. This is so obviously a studio move, to capitalize on as much money as possible. Much like how Tarantino wanted Kill Bill to be one movie with an intermission, but the studio wanted it to be 2 parts, released a year apart. They always do this with popular movies too. They started this in the early 2000's with the Matrix sequels and Kill Bill. Lord of the Rings is an exception where I agree with this strategy. They did it with The Hobbit, which did not work. They also did it with Twilight, and Hunger Games, another mistake. Anyone who has seen Kill Bill as one movie will tell you it should have stayed one movie. Part 2 was so boring compared to part 1. The whole movie together, while long, is so much better, and doesn't have that cheesy direct to camera narration in part 2. ...but the studios wanted the most money. If you look at the track record of this, it's rarely a good idea. Make a complete movie, and follow it up with another complete movie. Don't make people wait 5 years to see a sequel, only to give us 1/2 a movie, and wait a year for the second half. Don't get me wrong, this movie was really well done, but I wanted a whole movie.",

400,3 June 2023,antonioprado03,9, Animation for adults,"Across the Spider-Verse is a movie aimed towards adults. Sure, kids will love it, but there are nuances only adults (especially comics fans) will capture. There aren't many theatrical animated movies like that. Across the Spider-Verse is an important film as it helps break the stigma that adults can't enjoy animation.",
401,4 June 2023,Littlesummer14,10, Such an amazing experience,"I love this movie! I love to see so many spider people, i love how they explain the multiverse. Imho, the story is a bit dragging however it might be this way to set up the second one next year. I don't mind to sit for 2 hours in the cinema and i enjoy every second of it. I love the artstyle.. seriously! Lately, with all the boring movie from disn*y and the gloomy theme they choose, this one feels like a fresh air. At least to me. So beautifully drawn, so colorful and yeah.. even when some part of it can be bit boring, i still can't keep my eyes off this movie. It's worth to watch. I am hoping to watch it again next year in the cinema. It's worth every penny.",
402,3 June 2023,julliskorr,10, AMAZING!!! SPECTACULAR!!! Referance intended😂,"This movie was the single best Spider-Man film ever created. The animation, the acting, the story and the writing could not be better. I will definitely be re-watching this movie many times over. All I can do is thank Sony for bringing us this masterpiece of a film. The animation quality is groundbreaking and every second could be framed and put on a wall. I could watch the move at half speed and have as much of not more fun than the fist time around. There were scenes that looked like they were ripped straight from a comic book. The random funny text bubbles were amazing and incredibly funny. 11/10 would recommend and rewatch.",
403,1 June 2023,danabyabraham,10, Spectacularly amazing,"This movie is soo soo good. Didn't expect it to get better than the first film which was already a masterpiece. This one is levels above it and I mean it. The animation is top notch and story is just crazy good. Along with all this, the soundtrack by metro Boomin is perfect with some beautiful songs. This is by far one of the best Spider-Man movies of all time. The wide list of Spider-Man in this movie and the various Easter eggs and references hidden in the movie is amazing for any comic book fan. If the spider verse movies follow the same pattern then beyond the spider verse is gonna be the greatest Spider-Man movie of all time. To top it all of just wanna say ""I am Brooklyn's only Spider-Man"".",

Not only is this the greatest Spiderman film ever, I'm going to take it a couple of steps further and say that its the greatest animated film of all time and a top 5 comic book film of all time. I'd put this movie in the same tier as 'The Dark Knight', 'Avengers: Infinity War', 'Logan' it is THAT good. This movie was an absolute masterpiece from start to finish. I fully expect this movie to sweep the Oscars for animated films and I expect it to be a candidate for film of the year!!!! I highly recommend everyone go see this film asap.",

Before the film had even finished I had already decided this was the best animated film ever. The artwork is amazing it's like watching a two hour art-piece. The pacing was perfect, no scene felt unnecessary or too long. The voice acting captured the characters perfectly and the music was never too loud and overbearing.

The story is perfect in every which way.it tells the story of a boy being betrayed because he is different and shouldnt exist.

I never thought this movie would top the first one, but man o man it does, in every way. It's something hard to see these days. They have made ""Spot"" a very intriguing character. As we have never seen before. Every character has been done very well. But Gwen steals the show!",
430,6 June 2023,nwghhyj,6, It's half a movie. That had to push politics.,"This would be a 10 except no one warned us that this movie strangely ends right in the middle of a fight scene and it's tainted by the new evil empire's political ideology being pushed on us throughout. Hollywood can't miss an opportunity to indoctrinate kids in America. But if that were removed then the story and execution of the unique artistic style would have landed this thing at a 9 or 10. I am sure my review gets buried due to the giant corporation that owns this platform being told what they are allowed to promote by their left wing overlords, but it is a solid first half of a movie so see it once it comes out on a streaming platform. Not worth giving more money to the ""cause"" of our new dictatorship.",

From the moment the film begins, I was taken on an emotional rollercoaster, experiencing the highs and lows of the characters on screen. I couldn't get enough of the stunning visuals, energetic soundtrack, and dynamic storyline, and found myself completely immersed in the world that the film created.

The entire movie was full of great emotion, but I didn't feel myself truly invested until the twist in the 3rd act, and then the movie just ends. In contrast to the previous film, the villain is entertaining and the fights are extreme, but not so much as to confuse to what I'm seeing. This films predecessor perfectly wrapped a nice bow around the end and left it on a nice lead into this movie. Instead this movie squanders its time with introducing new characters instead of advancing the plot. Lots of fat to be trimmed, good humor, but overall just a set up film for the next.

The storyline in general was just PHENOMENAL. The Spot was an amazing villain although we didn't see much of him, but i am very excited to see him in part 2. The cameos were also super fun, it was like looking for hidden Easter eggs in every scene. Everything about this movie far surpasses the first. The only complaint I have about this movie is that Miles didn't have a Leap of Faith moment, but nonetheless, the movie was amazing and extremely fun to watch. You can't give detailed reviews as I was going to give it a 9.8/10 but that's basically a 10/10 so lets just say that.

I don't know if anyone else has felt this but recently, movies have not seemed AMAZING to me. I usually sit in the movie wondering how long is left because it starts getting boring. I think if I remember correctly, the last AMAZING movie I watched was Avengers: Endgame. But now it's this. Even while having extremely high hopes, this movie still went above and beyond. The artwork, the music, the story line, everything was amazing. When it ended I was just surprised how fast the time had passed and I was left wanting for more. Every little easter egg, every little detail, everything was awesome. I cannot put into words how much this movie left me shocked. It is impossible to say.

I thought this movie was going to be a bit boring in the beginning but when the action scenes came, Oh there are no words to describe the pure creativeness and art because it's just too good. The first one definitely surpassed all my expectations but this doubled down on that. The songs and visuals are just perfection. This movie also does leave you on the edge of your seats most of the times to always not know what's coming next. That's what cinema is about to me and the way they express it through art and a movie like this is something way beyond. Can't wait for the sequel next year.

464,5 June 2023,clairevictoria-74843,10," My eyes, hears and soul have been touched by an angel","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-verse is the greatest movie of all time. The animation is groundbreaking as expected but also not at all as expected. They pumped it up to one-million for this movie and every single shot looks like a single piece of one of the greatest works of art. The soundtrack is so beautiful, definitely Oscar worthy. This is all not to mention my hopes for this movie were not high due to my adoration for the first film and movie history of bad sequels. I haven't read too many of the marvel comics, but the the progression of this story is immaculate and the writing is off the rails. The reveal that Miles was never meant to be Spider-Man made so much and so little sense, something I've never experienced while watching a movie. At the beginning I felt there was a bit of a tone issue because it kept switching from lighthearted to dark, but I eventually got the sense that the lightheartedness was there for build up towards the actual, really dark part of the movie. And goddamn was I right. Mile's arrival in Earth-42 is one of the most intense scenes in all of movie history. I was at the edge of my seat, someone who is usually unaffected by some of the supposed most scary horror movies of all time. And the fact that this movie had that amount of control that it did over my emotions is unbelievable. It is unbelievable how beautifully directed, animated, written, storyboarded, and everything else in between this movie is. There is a heck of a lot of respect towards every version of spider-man in this movie. The inclusion of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man and the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man really made me as a viewer feel like a part of this massive, infinite story that's gone on for generations. That is a feeling that cannot be replicated. The conversation about traditional story structures in media with heros and villains, death and trauma is something I never would have expected. I believe there is even commentary on race in media in this movie as well, with Mile's mom's words towards Miles and then Miguel's repetition of ""You don't belong,"" ""You're the odd-one-out,"". Expertly done, I believe the message is nuanced enough to touch a lot of people in the most important ways.",

I believe the only bad thing I heard is that it ended right at the beginning of where all of the action will start. Now that is kind of true but there's still plenty of action in this to keep you entertained. Some people say that they think that this movie is just there to set up the next one, I guess you could say that because it does set up the next one but this movie is great with its plot, some plot twists, and it's incredible animation. Some new characters mentioned is, Spider-Man 099 (Miguel O'Hara), Spider woman, Spider punk ( Hobie Brown), as well as Spider-Man India (Pavitr Prabhakar). This movie was really good at introducing the characters and getting you to either root for them or to dislike them wanting them to fail. So many Easter eggs to count too, overall this movie was great with its visuals and animation it was great with story telling, plot setting, and introducing characters. I give this movie a 8/10 because I liked the movie, it was great but it wasn't perfect, it did feel a little slow at times and where it did just abruptly end. But that was expected because it was advertised as a part one many times so you can't be mad at that. It was a fun watch, will watch it again, I do recommend watching it, I'm still deciding if it's better than the first one and it might be.

This movie headed towards a darker tone then the first Spiderverse film. I noticed many Easter eggs, some not even related to Spider-Man were found throughout this movie.

501,2 June 2023,foxydaemoon,8, Great,"The animation is well done as the first movie, and I like the characters. The thing is that the movie is a continuation of the first movie but with a lacking plot and unfinished ending so you know it is done to connect it to the 'MCU'. While i understand where they're coming from i think the movie as a standalone would be better bc these types of endings kinda bother me. I think it was interesting to explore Miles' character, him being 'accidentally' bitten by another universe's spider and becoming spider based on an anomaly, and it also causing Peter's death are all fun stuff. The ''with great power comes great responsiblity'' narrative comes back and is connected to the story. 'Every spider loses someone they love' that was one of the most interesting parts for sure. The villain, Spot, could have been given more spot light (ahah) so his character could have been a little bit more interesting. And the 'funny bits / banter' stuff could have been included... less, as many times they became too much and overused. Overall it is a great movie and the animation is still spectacular but the other bits have their own flaws.",

503,6 June 2023,kelmndz,10, undeniable best spider-man movie ever,"It was perfect, the way the movie told the story and the ending was amazing. For me it was a masterpiece. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
""It's hard to think of a recent movie that has had a bigger impact on the film industry then 2018's Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Not only was it a highly unique comic book movie that came out at the height of the MCU's popularity, but also established a distinctly different style of animation that's since been used in other popular animated films. It was a trailblazer of a film that seemed impossible to follow up since the original was already near flawless so it was hard to imagine that the long anticipated sequel would somehow surpass it. Yet, that's precisely what ended up happening. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse didn't just double down on all the incredible elements that made the first film so truly spectacular, it tripled (if not quadrupled) down to make for an invigorating continuation that pushes the boundaries of animation to an overwhelming breaking point. Speaking of, let's talk about the presentation first because it can't be overstated how much of a visual marvel this film is. The kaleidoscope of visually distinct yet beautifully contrasting art styles in this feature made this an optically arresting experience that I could not look away from. Every frame of this film is enriched with unimaginable details and dedicated passion with a cornucopia of vibrant colors that made this film look so good that it's hard to not shed a tear for the imagery alone. It highlights the frenetically dazzling set-pieces, elevates the plentiful moments of witty humor, and sprinkles in hundreds of references/easter eggs that will make future viewings even more fun. Yet, for all the lavish entertainment that this film offers, it never forgets about telling a thoroughly engaging story with both personal and universal stakes with layered characters that you earnestly care about. Part of this does come from the phenomenal voice acting from the ensemble of talent with not a single weak link in the entire cast. The main reason though is that the production takes its time to have its story patiently unfold in the background while keeping the spotlight on the hardship that the characters are going which makes them both endearing and relatable. Yet, despite the film's lengthy runtime of 140 minutes, it still moves at a perfect pace that knows when to speed up to throw some rapid-fire jokes at you and slow down to let the drama marinate. If I really had to nitpick something in this movie, I guess that we didn't need the heavy dump of exposition in the first act to remind us of what happened in the first film. Also, this film is decidedly a part one kind of film that ends on a huge cliffhanger so I suppose that this flick won't be completely satisfying until part two comes out next year. That doesn't change the fact that this feature floored me from start to finish, and I can't wait to see it multiple times before the conclusion. In short, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is one of those rare movies that doesn't just meet the hype; it miraculously surpasses it! It weaves an expansive and ambitious web that's expertly spun together by a dramatically rich story that's populated by layered characters that you're fully invested in which is already enough to carry the feature. Yet, we're also treated to a staggering assault on the senses that celebrates the iconic web slinger with groundbreaking animation, stunning action sequences, hysterically clever humor, and an endless onslaught of references that will require multiple viewings to catch them all. It feels a bit redundant to call this one of the greatest comic book movies of all time since it managed to blow its spectacular predecessor out of the water. So all I can say is that Sony is just one movie away from making arguably the greatest comic book trilogy of all time. If your spidey sense isn't already tingling then swing on over to the theater as soon as possible to watch one of the best movies of 2023""!",
504,4 June 2023,j-70434,9, Perfect yet unfinished,Why is this a 9?? Well because of the story and development of a character we love and the way it's expanded is truly masterful. I only wanted more of this movie every minute. The runtime flew by. The music was great including the score and the soundtrack. The animation was perfect and I have never been more engaged in a animated movie. As one who thought Into the spider verse was overrated by a little (it's still a great movie) I thought this one took it to the next level. The spot was great and his slow descent into a crazy villain was wild. It sets up the next movie in a wild way I just wish we had a better payoff in the end to complete the story instead of a huge cliffhanger with not much to complete the movie. Infinity war set up a cliffhanger perfectly and I think they should've took a route with this one. Some characters I wanted to see more of though. The unfinished feel of the movie Is the only reason why it's a 9. Overall a masterpiece.,

I got so overstimulated by the constant flashing lights that I could not enjoy the film. I was having to watch through my fingers. I don't understand why they decided to make 80% of the film a jolting van gogh kaleidoscope, that feels like you're watching it all in VR. It felt as if the Visual Team wanted the entire film to mirror the feeling you get as you're going through the wormhole sequence in Doctor Strange, but for 2.5hrs. Kinda feels Ableist to be honest. I could not enjoy the film, it was torturous. I am deeply saddened by just how flashy the film was. Also, what was the message of the film? Parenting is hard and it's ok to be selfish to get what you desire, regardless of consequences? I'm really confused by the high scores. I consider myself to be a cinephile, with having seen thousands of films and enjoying most all films, sometimes even bad ones. I am saddened to say that I am deeply in disagreement with the 9.1 current rating and 90% rotten, it makes no sense to me at all. This film was so over produced that it made my head physically hurt. Sony, maybe try and be less ableist when you're thinking about creating 2hrs of strobe light animation; it didn't need the consistent glitching, pulsating, and flashing mechanic to the multi-layered animation styles.",

The only downfall for this movie is that it ends on a cliffhanger. That is the reason why i am giving this 9/10. I wish that it did not end on a cliffhanger.

The main villain is only in the film for maybe 10 minutes and when ever the story felt like it was dragging they would throw in cameos from past films, comics, and tv shows. For a movie that is over 2 hours it definitely felt like a cash grab from Sony only to give us a real sequel in the next movie, beyond the spider-verse.

I don't want to spoil it for anyone so I'll keep spoilers to myself. But the action packed twists and turns that I didn't expect added to the experience.

Not to mention the fact that this second chapter is only the prologue for what will be (it is assumed) the possible ending of this saga starring miles morales. When I went to the cinema to see Spider-Man across the spider verse I didn't expect such beauty, and instead he managed to greatly exceed my already very high expectations (given the grandeur of the first film). All the beautiful characters, from protagonists to simple extras, really well done, with good stories and funny too, the additions of all these new spider man and the relationship between them is really a touch of class.

Every character in this film is so unique and the experience is so thrilling that at times i shook with excitement or fear.

The voice actors bring their characters to life with impeccable performances, injecting depth and emotion into every line. From the exhilarating action sequences to the heartfelt character moments, this film captures the essence of Spider-Man like no other, leaving audiences in awe and craving more.

Its better than any MCU film, its miles better than any of the classic golden age Disney Renassiance films of 89-99(yes im sorry, even the Lion King), its better than any film that has won best picture in the last 15-20 years.

The idea of waiting 1 more year just to get an ending is not satisfying at all. They could have finish the story or cut it earlier. The ending scene was no place to end a movie. I feel like watching a Turkis drama series, which is not what I came for. I was really enjoying the film until the ending which was really devastating for my expectations of this movie. They just made this film to bond the last film which is kind of destroys the idea of enjoying it. In all spiderman movies, this was the worst of all.

It had one of the best written stories ever it had good pacing, character development, animation, perfect sequences, etc.. it had everything and the spot is easily one of the most fearsome villains in fiction and he truly feels like a villain when I watch because he makes me even more excited for the trilogy.

Loved the framed story structure, it gave us a full story, meanwhile the end was the real beginning. Cannot express the excitement that this movie brought, there are so many details and just-perfect-nuances of scenes from each sequence that cannot be fully absorbed after one viewing. Definitely worth a couple of rewatch, not just because of the details, but because of the masterpiece that created here needs to be seen more. As great as I thought the first part was, the second was as good, if not better. Patiently waiting for the 3rd movie which just as its prequels, will be highly appreciated.",

The humors were well-organized that it was capable to stimulate me smoothly and excite me in a remarkable way. In short and in fact, I truly enjoyed this movie much more than any Marvel or superheroes related I had recently watched after Marvel's Avengers Endgame. Its vibes were even beyond the spirit of the recent live action Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, just because Spider-Man is what I had met long before it, and the essence of Spider-Man never getting old!

564,4 June 2023,matthewwongsc,8, A beautiful sequel to one of the best Spider-Man stories ever put on screen,"Just finished watching Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and it sure is a spectacle. Highlights of the movie were definitely the visuals, and the amazing animation team behind the film have stepped-up their game big time. The vibrant colours, environments, and the mish-mash of a range of styles really reminded me of Everything Everwhere All At Once. The inclusion of the Multiverse feels important and intentional to the story, as it should, which the mainline MCU has had me disappointed with their inclusions in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Spider-Man: No Way Home. The story can feel a little incomplete and unsatisfactory due to the cliffhanger ending, but unlike Fast X, I am even more hyped for Beyond the Spider-Verse coming next March. Most of the main cast and characters have their stories expanded in so many different ways, with a highlight definitely being Gwen Stacy. She was a fan favourite character from the first film, and I've always wanted to see more of her story. Not to mention Miles himself, as we see him grapple with what it means to be Spider-Man. The first hour of the movie took a much slower pace, but a much deserved part of the story so that we can slow down from MCU style visual noise and legitimately get to know and understand our three-dimensional characters. Then again, the pacing felt a bit stilted in the beginning, and felt like it was going to end several times near the end. With the film being almost 2.5 hours long, it can feel like quite some work, even though some of my favourite parts of the movie were when the story took it slow. Also, the story does somewhat suffer from being The Empire Strikes Back of the series, and I just really want to see the characters and their relationships be fully fleshed out (more than I want to see the actual ""story"" per say. But still a brilliant watch nonetheless. Following Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, it's an immense relief to finally see creatives and artists tell a meaningful story with heart and dedication out of the unrelenting slog from Marvel the previous few years. Congratulations to the Spider-Verse team for spinning out such a visually spectacular and truly heartfelt film!",

With other characters who also came into this film late. I didn't think this film would be better than this first. But its better than no way home on my opinion. Another reason why I think this film is good is because even though the villan didn't have much screen time he did play his part very well.",

569,4 June 2023,mradrian-04320,4, Personal Opinion Spiderverse 2,"Spiderverse 2, while visually stunning and thrilling, falls slightly short of the original's personal magic. The storyline, though captivating, lacks the depth and originality that made its predecessor exceptional. The pacing is solid, keeping the audience engaged, and the action sequences are undeniably impressive. However, they don't quite deliver the same impact as the innovative set pieces in the first film. The voice acting and animation remain top-notch, maintaining the high standards set by the franchise. While Spiderverse 2 is a worthy sequel that entertains and impresses, it fails to fully capture the distinctive personality and emotional resonance that made the first film a masterpiece.

If the story was more fleshed, not so much wasted Spider potential, and better art it would have received a higher score. I do enjoy the moral and personal scenes about Miles.

579,5 June 2023,jdlight-31337,8, A Great Spider-Man Film with Immersion flaws.,"Overall, great animation, vibrant colors, good music and heartwarming moments with good character development. Gwen's story and Miles story are both told and expanded in a way to draw out feelings to care about their issues. There are a couple of things that did not make it a perfect Spider-Man film. Yes, there are a ton of Spider-Mans everywhere. I, personally, do not understand how the new iteration of Jessica Drew Spider-Woman being pregnant and putting her baby in danger while wearing nothing but big glasses to hide her identity made any sense. Spider-Man and his/her mask goes hand in hand. It breaks a key fundamental on why Spider-Man always wears a mask. Also, the baby inside her womb seems like it would be rattled and she could even give birth by using too much physical force, which she did plenty of. Who wrote that in and thought it was a good idea? It definitely broke immersion during those ridiculous character actions. They are just not smart or thoughtful for the baby. Jessica Drew's new look was definitely a bad design all around. Sure, I know some people would say there is always a possibility like that out there in an infinite alternate universe. It still doesn't make her a good character just because she can exist. Pavitr Prabhakar Spider-Man was entertaining and a fun character. His main flaw was how perfect he was. Spider-Man isn't perfect, ever, and that is what makes him the perfect super hero imo. Also, what ever happened to the Spider senses? They were there sometimes and other times they were nonexistent. Also, Miles Morales out-running that many Spider-Mans by his lonesome would not be possible. He is too young to be able to outsmart all the other Spider-Mans with more experience. Yes, I get it. It is his story, so he has to have plot armor, but make it more believable. Why didn't Miguel just guard the only way out of his universe from the beginning? For someone who looks at every detail to maintain the universes in balance, he sure lacks common sense. Having said all that, there is plenty to enjoy in this film. It could've been perfect, but it has its issues that I, as a Spider-Man fan, cannot overlook. It was still a very fun watch. My favorite parts were those with Peter B. Parker and Mayday. Oh, and I definitely did enjoy the Spot as Miles Morales' nemesis. His entire persona is not seen too often in a villain. He was funny and, most importantly, very dangerous by the end of the film. It was a shame to not see the final conclusion in this film. I do sure hope they do not fluff the next film and that it ends in a solid note to make it one of the best animated trilogies to ever be made.",
580,3 June 2023,headbag-68304,10, Across The Best Film,"This movie was incredible! I can't wait to see the sequel after this one, and I love the dark atmosphere and the sudden twist of the story. This was the best animated film of 2023 in my own opinion. With Miles having to step up his own game just to fit in with Gwen and the gang, it was depressing but at the same time very funny. This movie explored further in within the universes, or multiverses of every Spider-Man, and with it, they made the concept much more darker imaginable. The end act of the movie is more dark and menacing as you can see that Miles wants to save his father before the law of the universe that happens is met.",
581,2 June 2023,tysonbigtv,1," Filled with fluff, hardly any story, 'has a to be continued'",One of the worst movies I've seen in years. Has a 'to be continued' even though there was barely a story. Don't bother seeing it or watching the next one. Pretentious and unfinished just to spread box office money further with another movie. The film was filled with member berries and a desperate need to try and retcon a connection with Disney's Marvel cinematic universe. Across the spider verse was also unfunny which was really dissappointing. The only positive would have to be the animation style was still nice. I'd say more but I don't want to drag this out as they tried to with their lackluster plot.,

It doesn't top the original spider verse movie, and many scenes/events Depend on the next movie, both to prove that they were worthwhile, and to receive a payoff.

I can tell they took a lot of time during this movie on all the details. But it took away from the movie. Her hair kept changing colors and while talking the background is changing scenes. Was distracting for me. 4/10 cause story line sucked... Maybe only 30 or 40 mins of the movie was needed. The rest is a drag out scene of collecting people for some epic showdown that dosen't even happen. So u can skip this movie and just wait for the battle in the 2nd part.

The artists behind this movie could not have done a better job. More than that, the movie was greatly inclusive, in a way that so many mainstream movie are not.

This movie was basically a trailer to the next movie they make but hopefully it is better than this pile of garbage. This movie is just carried by the animation and the music because the rest is just miles and Gwen flirting or miles talking to his family members or to the other spidermen.

It's easily the best animated (as in- the animation) film of all time- even the first isn't competition. The story is kinetic, stunning and shocking. The only tiny issue was I felt it overpaced itself a bit in the middle, but I suspect that will lessen on a second viewing. All I can say is get to a theater as soon as you can. To Phil Lord, Chris Miller, the directors, everyone on the creative team and the 1000 animators, you're incredible.

This movie is incredible like the first movie, the only thing that holds it back from being a 10 for me (which the first film was) is the ending being slightly disappointing, not much of a conclusion and more of a lead-in to the next film, ""Beyond The Spiderverse"" which will release next March. When I checked the runtime of this movie after watching and saw that it was OVER 2 HOURS, I was stunned. This movie goes by very quickly and I think that says a lot about what it does, it gets you lost in the stellar animation, the development of these characters (which has remained remarkably consistent from the first film, by the way.)",

I don't even need to try to focus, it just grabbed me and I was concentrated the entire time. I don't know if I've ever been so focused on a movie or show. Story is not bad either.

619,4 June 2023,bensessford,10, 140 Minutes of Pure Visual Bliss,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is by all means the most visually stunning film I have ever seen. The stylistic choices it uses alongside its masterful writing writing with its quick and snappy dialogue blend the film into a work of art. The directors and cast take all the charm and innovation from the first movie and use it as foundation to craft a well fitting sequel worthy of possibly living up to the name as the greatest animated film of all time. While watching this film there was not a single moment when there wasn't a smile on my face from the nearly perfected visuals. Worthy of a watch from everybody.,
620,6 June 2023,claytonre,10, Cinema Art,"I wanted to see the movie again freediving I left the movie theater, as well as who does not see the continuation of the story of Miles and Gwen who were the protagonists of this movie, as well as the good development of the new and old secondary characters, all they have a unique personality. This movie simply differs from many movies, Sony embodied everything that a film director and the audience wanted in a movie, letting the imagination run wild with effects and animation that in the past was only capable of being imagined by us, incredible settings, and the music 10/10, I felt this as a dream come true movie and a brilliant story undercurrent in all aspects. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023) has set the bar very high for other movies, not just animation or the superhero genre, because for me this movie is one of the top 10 best movies of all time, I know looking forward to the sequel, great job Sony!",
621,6 June 2023,odlanherman,1, Nothing happened,"I really like the animation style, particularly how it changed between the universes; the soundtrack was also really good. However, i wasn't a fan of much else. The jokes Myles made were clearly directed to 11-12 years olds. I'm sure I enjoyed the jokes to the first movie when I was a bit younger but at my current age I just found them a bit stupid to be honest. There was very little combat. His fight with the hole guy was not a proper fight in my opinion and apart from that there was literally no fighting. The only other decent bit was when Miguel slams him into the floor/wall but the scene looked better in the trailer to be honest.",
622,3 June 2023,taras07,2, Really long and the story is all over the place,"First I'll preface with I see what they were striving for but the story is all over the place, so it's hard to watch them flounder to get us there. We flip between characters allowing for little development or depth. Leaving us with a who cares. The relationships feel surface & a bit artificial, which is such a difference from the first movie so a huge disappointment. Especially as it relates to Miles parents. The music which was such a integral part of the first movie is nothing but background elevator music in this movie. What happened? The graphics were good at least.",
623,6 June 2023,paulghw,10, Honestly amazing,"This film stes the expectation for many other animated films. The animation is very unique as different earths had different art syles and character art style was different, with the main one being Hobie. His art sty definitely pulled him apart from the other characters and made him stand out. Gwens earth was cool as it was made drom water colour as well as the colour changing when the emotion of the characters change. This can be seen when gwen hugs her dad with the colour from the characters chaging orange and red symbolising tye warmth and love gwen feels from her farther. Also the music was great. When Spider-Man 2099 entered it gave me chills.",

626,5 June 2023,Richard-William-Brooks,7, Beautiful artwork and compelling story but....,"And that's the ting, as beautiful as it is, the story really stalls about mid-way through and I found myself looking at my watch because so much was left to be concluded because the story kept getting diverted. Lo and behold just when we start to see some progress again we are greeted with the old ""To be Continued "" and I would say a large percentage of the audience groaned with some verbal abuse thrown in. I would thoroughly recommend it but the audience needs to know in advance that it's a 2 parter. (I hope it's only a 2 parter!) It's a movie that definitely requires a rewatch though as it's bursting at the seams with detail and nuances that whizz by in the theatre. I want to wait until I can watch it at home and view it in slow motion. The artwork is beautiful and the action on steroids.",

I think it's even better than the First Part. The Second Half is simply GOD level. The first half has those fun jokes u expect from a spider man movie, but the second half will have u clutch them armrests ... you can't miss this movie nor the theater experience...coz believe with Metro Boomin on the beat u need that 4k+ Dolby Atmos combination. The only thing it lacked was an epic song like ""What's up Danger "" but i guess we can all agree that was one of a kind. The cliffhanger ending just topped things off, can't wait for the next part.",

It is leaps (pun intended) and bounds better than the last Spider-Verse movie, and even that was amazing. They really outdid themselves on this one. It was so visually appealing and entertaining. The story/plot, animation, and voice acting was top notch. There were multiple times where I dropped my jaw and was thinking wow. No spoilers but I loved Spot as a villain.",

The character development, writing, direction was great. It's part 1 of a 2 part movie so I'm holding off on calling it the greatest animated movie ever and I'm letting it age a bit. Amazing cliffhanger. March can't come soon enough. Gwen and Miles have such amazing chemistry together. I feel like this has a great message for the kids too telling them that it's okay be yourself and not who people tell you to be. Carve your own legacy. Miles Morales has done just that. If the 3rd film is even half as good as this. We might be witnessing one of the greatest trilogies of all time.",

This is real artistic work with colors and sounds that are mesmerizing, even through the credits. The storyline is so deep and wide, you are engaged the entire time and will discuss at length with others or need to see more than once. I guess the 5 year wait was worth it since this one can be seen many times waiting for the next BUT please don't make us wait that long again. So many potential spinoffs for so many spider-people for so many years - a winning combination I look forward to watching.",
640,2 June 2023,apocalyptoapu,1, Spectacular Spiderman comic purist movie but with no climax,"Being a Spiderman and multiverse purist, loved the movie. The comic centric cinematography, marvellous art, witty punchlines and the whole reference to Spiderman comics. Hand to heart, only a true Spiderman fan can even interpret most of the references. It was all going well, my expectations rising with the passage of movie...only to come to an abrupt disappointing end. In fact you can call it a masterpiece without a climax...if it even existed. The story never proceeded. It just hung in the middle air with the viewers craving for some substantial progress. The moment you feel all hell's gonna break lose, it just ends. Yes, with a typical ""to be continued...."" The disappointment was so palpable in the theatre, my fellow viewers couldn't stop swearing, even the kids. You make a stepping stone movie in the series without any real progress and disappoint fans, what do you expect? 1/10. The wait for some fulfillment begins, probably for 2-3 years now. So disappointed. 😔",
641,8 June 2023,edwardbutcher-47211,8, Decent!,"Very well written, directed. I wouldn't say 9 star probably 8 if I wasn't being biased. Pacing was very good, choreography was superberb for an animated title. I preferred the previous film only because this is a two parter. If you want a fun ride, watch this movie however if you are not a fan of superheroes as a sub genre, I would avoid this title. As a comic book fan, I loved this movie. The cameos were amazing, the action was amazing, not even talking about how mesmerizing the animation was! Miles got a lot of character development in this movie and Gwen Stacey. The stand out peformance was Oscar Isaac as Spider-man 2099. Overall, very good watch.",

643,7 June 2023,rockytopbetter,10," greatest animated movie ever, period.","Alright, i came into this with pretty high expectations feeling like it could definitely be better than ITSV, and i was definitely right on that, the animation was absolutely beautiful, the characters had amazing depth and you could definitely connect to some of them, the cliffhanger, now i was so focused in that i didn't even catch what miles glitching meant, but i figured it out soon enough, the theme song when prowler miles came in had me floating, one of the greatest theme songs in CBM history, most of all i love that you were on the edge of your seat from the get go, not knowing when the movie was gonna end or just get straight into the action, and when they did get into the action it was perfect, overall a 10 out of 10 movie and i believe BTSV will be up there with the greatest CBM movie ever, the dark knight. I can't wait for march 29th.",

646,5 June 2023,ledadaehler,6, Did you really have to end it that way?,"Awesome animation, but just a bit too long and the cliff hanger ending was a punch in the gut. Our whole theater groaned when it ended. They could have cut some of the dragging parts toward the end and fit it in one longer movie. Or, kept it as two shorter movies, also fine. But the pacing was just really off, it started fast paced and the last like 30 minutes were just too slow.",

649,6 June 2023,faraz-40502,8, Awesome,The movie is really great and a worthy sequel of a masterpiece like Spiderman into the spider verse . This movie shows what super hero movies are capable of and surpass the source material which is quite rare these days. The animation was so beautiful and had insane amount of details. The only unsatisfying thing I have experienced while watching this movie was that the ending felt more like an interval rather than a climax and the soundtrack felt a little short in comparison to Spiderman into across the spider verse. The movie is still extremely enjoyable and very entertaining and you can take your whole family to watch the movie and have a great time.,
650,4 June 2023,rameshmuralipa,3, Overrated,"After seeing hype went for movie. Some good visual in Chase & fights. Except that there is no plot easily a normal story after we know they introduced concept in movies already. Visuals very okay during conversations, concepts forced in to audience not Strong way, lacking story repititively talking about samething. I recently used to watch anime's too good in story telling with less graphics. Oscars did for unfair to anime by avoiding so many good anime series & movies not giving awards instead because of internal politics giving some to good cartoons & more to average ones. Likewise, Politics played made this movie over hype. Audience believe it's good becoz they don't want to see give up their fav hero that's truth & cause they don't want this movie to fail. I respect it to somewhat but Franchise, popularity fuelled with hype, rating and so on to say. I'm not one sided even anime has bad ones & deservable ones. People love good lies rather accepting the truth, that's harsh reality in everything. ""Hatred is born in order to protect loved ones, I need more hatred since commenting this who knows"".",

The animation style 10/10 and the character development 10/10. Go see this film so they can continue to make films like this. It's set a new bar for comic movies. I'm so excited for the next chapter and hope that the MCU see what this team have created and realise that this is the type of film fans want to go and see. The way they used Easter eggs was clever and respectful and the performances by every single actor was exceptional. Well done Spiderverse team! Thank you for creating one of the best animated films ever.,

Amazing spiderman with Andrew has always been my fave. But Miles Morales just blew that out the water. And across the Spider-Verse is my all time favorite Spiderman.. Thank you to the entire team it's a masterpiece 10/11. Keep pushing and going it really does capture the soul of the human spirit to keep fighting pushing your limits and never give up. After this film I think we all will discover there is a little spiderman in all of us and most importantly understanding there is nothing greater than Hope which is what this film delivers in every aspect!!,

And I know you like staying loyal to the comics so this would be perfect!! Anyway overall, 9/10.",
659,5 June 2023,chamberlainjace,9, Such a good movie,"This movie was very good but i feel some things could have been done better, such as the soundtrack was worse than the first movie and i feel that spot could have been used as a better antagonist to set up the second movie. Spot being the main antagonist is the whole reason for these last two movies in the trilogy. Even though Spiderman 2099 was a very good antagonist and probably the most near perfect antagonist in animated movie history he wasn't the whole part of the story and doesn't play as much of a key roll as Spot does. Mike's going to the wrong dimension and meeting himself was set up perfectly though such as the foreshadowing from the first movie into the second showing sony has had a very good plan for this trilogy since the start. The Prowler foreshadowing in the first movie where you can see peter get a spider sense and miles being purple and green showing the prowler is the best foreshadowing i've ever seen this also showing how he was supposed to become prowler in his dimension and 42's miles was supposed to be spider-man which is why is dad died and he used this as a fuel to hurt and potentially kill miles at the end of the second movie. Overall movie was great near perfect 9/10 soundtrack could have been better and Spot could have been better as well.",

Every scene is a painting itself and if you notice closely you can see the pattern change in the bg according to the feelings of each scene and their attention to details is just amazing!!AND GOD THE SOUNDTRACK WAS FIRE especially when miguel appears on the scene,the beat drop was 🔥 As a wrap its a must watch, oh and if yall are wondering why I still gave it a 9 is that for some reason I love into the spiderverse a lil more. I mean ofc this was great but everything got spicy (or spicier)from the second half onlyy.",
661,7 June 2023,brianqi,9, Brought My Childhood Fantasy Out,"First off, the animation in this movie was absolutely amazing. I love how they took on the comic look rather than the ""Pixar look"". Additionally, as a filler movie, the conflict/resolution points were amazing. There were so many different conflicts which made the movie interesting throughout the whole film. This is the only movie that has brought out my childhood fantasy. I'm now too emotionally invested in Gwen & Miles, they better get together in the next one. The only reason I give this movie a 9 is because of how hard they blue balled me at the ending. Overall this movie was a action packed and emotional rollercoaster. Need to find me a Gwen lol... too bad she's from an alternate dimension. This movie was so emotionally complete, I literally made an account just to review this movie.",
662,8 June 2023,huesca-34491,8, Visually Dynamic Experience,"For a movie that is visually dynamic, this true spectacle really gives audiences the experience to fully grasp the different styles of animation while providing good characterization amongst different versions of a character we all love. This movie stars Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) along with Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) who bring life and energy to the overall plot of the story. This is a story where Miles overcomes his shell and proves that HE IS Spider-Man in his own way. While I found the animations to be artistic and creative, I also felt that the more times I see this film, the more my eyes become desensitized due to there being so much color, so much fighting going around, each character with its own unique animation, I do feel it can become disorienting and visually weary to some audiences. Nonetheless, the acting and chemistry was splendid. I do feel that the movie was a bit long, but I was satisfied with each character being flushed out and giving a little more depth to understand their motivations and themes. Specifically towards Gwen's character and Spider-Man 2099's character.",

This movie really dives into the back story of Gwen and her troubled past along with her problems in the present as she wrestles with whether she should do what's right, or save her only friend. The Spot in this movie is fantastic as he turns from a joke to character to a serious threat. The movie delivers on the ""cameos"" as it doesn't focus to much on them but still warms your heart when you see them. This movie is great!",

If they continued adding so much intense into the narration, I expect the next movie would have gods as characters.",
