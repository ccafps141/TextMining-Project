0,30 August 2004,Quinoa1984,10," If you like ransom/police storiesmysteries, and have interest in Kurosawa &/or Mifune, check it out at least once","High and Low, like Yojimbo and Throne of Blood, combines elements to create something special while seeming rather routine- while Yojimbo seems like a bad-ass samurai flick, it has the ingredients of a western and satire, and Throne of Blood is a rather faithful, strange adaptation of Macbeth in the guise of a warlord/samurai tale, High and Low does a similar method. Akira Kurosawa, a filmmaker who gets film buff's ears lit up at the mere mention of him, can usually be counted on to keep a film interesting even if it may not be entertaining to some of the crowd that likes a section of his movies or another (there's usually a split between his samurai/medieval tales and epics, and his dramas about the tragedies of ordinary people).

1,1 August 2004,jemmytee,10, Kurosawa at his best and most subtle,"This is one of those rare movies I had to watch twice to catch all the meaning and beauty of its construction, that is how sleek and polished this film is. The storyline is deceptively simple -- a businessman named Gondo is about to take control of the company he's worked in for years when he's told his son's been kidnapped.  It turns out the kidnappers got his chauffeur's son by mistake, but they still want him to pay the ransom.  If he does, he will be financially ruined.  If he doesn't, he will be reviled.  Which will he choose?  This makes up the first half of the movie, culminating in a breathtaking scene on one of Japan's bullet trains.  The second half is the police search for the kidnapper/murderer and how a case is built that will take him to the gallows.",r

He aims to make affordable, sturdy footwear for the masses. His co-workers opt instead for those of the cheap, low-quality variety that will wear easily, meaning they will need to be replaced often. In secret, Gondo organizes a leveraged buyout of the company, mortgaging all he has to afford it. However, just before he makes the deal, the son of his chauffeur is kidnapped and held for ransom. It's clear the kidnappers intended to kidnap Gondo's child, and he feels just as responsible as if they had. Will the police- led by the capable Inspector Tokura- be able to find the child and solve the extortion plot before it's too late?",i
5,6 April 2018,classicsoncall,8," ""I'd rather be told the cruel truth than to be fed gentle lies.""","Up till now I've only seen Toshiro Mifune in Kurosawa's samurai movies, so it was kind of comical to see and hear him in this film when he stated ""Shoes are my life"". It just struck me as rather funny, but then, almost on a dime, Mifune's character Kingo Gondo reacted to his young son playing cowboys with a friend by stating that in a tense situation, ""Man must kill or be killed"". That had to be a subliminal rationale for Gondo's decision to wrest control of his National Shoe Company away from the owner and executive board. Borrowing against everything he owned, he was about to make a business deal that would have set him up for life.",e
6,10 October 2001,dorlago,10, Intense and Highly Entertaining,"""High and Low"" could be considered two movies.  The first, ""High"" takes place in Kingo Gondo's (Mifune's) hilltop mansion.  The crime occurs and what follows in the next hour is one of the most meticulous and brilliantly constructed film segments I have ever seen!  The first half of the film could almost be considered theatre.  It is static and deceptively simple but.....so intense!  The ensemble acting is superb with Mifune a stand out as usual!  Connecting these two movies is the train sequence.  After the calculated intensity of the first part this scene comes at you like a sledgehammer!  These four or five minutes are magnificent!  So very exciting and so very quick it leaves you drained when it ends!  ""Low"" begins with the hunt for the criminal.  Only ""Stray Dog"" comes closer to capturing the cop's decent into hell.  This last part of the film is fast and furious.  We are no longer an observer.  We have become part of the chase.  First, we know who the criminal is.  The police do not know and what follows is a fascinating puzzle being put together before our eyes!  The last scene in the film is unexpected, deeply disturbing and left me numb and staring at the TV screen after the film had ended.  Like Gondo we are left with the answers  that we did not want to hear.",w

He is an honest man who loves his job as a shoe factory exec and is in a battle for corporate control against a pack of hyenas.  He has mortgaged and borrowed and scraped to raise the money for a surprise coup when his son is kidnapped.  But there is a major plot twist: it is not HIS son that was taken but his son's playmate, the chauffeur's kid and the ransom demanded is astronomical.  If he pays he will lose everything he has worked so hard for, but can he just sacrifice the chauffeur's child because it is not his?  From here on High and Low (perhaps better translated as Heaven and Hell) is a police procedural based on an Ed McBain 87th precinct story.",r
9,25 September 2004,marstokyo,9, I was enthralled from start to finish.,"This movie was incredible!! They called it Film Noir but, my God, it's so much better than THAT-- This film out-Hitchcocks Hitchcock! And I'm a Hitchcock devotee. The issues Kurosawa wrestles with in this, and his other films; the ethic responsibility we have as humans, humanity vs. greed, crime and punishment are universally understood. Nothing he presents in black and white(except literally in the film stock)-- but every shade of grey is reflected on. The story unfolds slowly but contains many twists and turns as the viewer questions the motives of each character. It's not just the force of good against evil--but a question of what is morally right and morally wrong. The title itself clues the viewer in to the ambiguities of class, greed, and moral ethic.",w

It's one of the few modern dramas directed by the Master, as if his usual period ""Samurai"" movies wouldn't fit the social significance he's aiming at.",3
11,30 September 2007,Steffi_P,7," ""It's very interesting to make fortunate people unfortunate""","In the late 50s and early 60s Kurosawa's pictures began to get increasingly pessimistic and depersonalised.

12,14 February 2001,ross_d,10," The masterpiece of the ""police procedural"" genre","This is one of the outstanding detective films.  For me, the most remarkable feature of this film is its architecture - the beginning is a long, static set piece taking place in one room.  however, about a third of the way through the movie, it erupts into action, showing the resourcefulness of a largely blue collar police force tracking a lone sociopathic criminal.",4

High and Low was adapted from the novel ""King's Ransom"" by Ed McBain, and though I haven't read the novel, the film stands up surprisingly in a completely different setting (Japan, as opposed to America).  The script is great, the cinematography is outstanding, and if you're watching the Criterion print available on DVD you'll find yourself wondering if it was really made in 1963.  This film scores an easy 10 with me.  I can't think of a crime film that I enjoyed more than this one.",5
15,29 July 2016,net_orders,9, Hitchcock Japanese Style.,"Viewed on DVD. Perhaps the best in the Kurosawa canon! A close to seamless cinema/home-video experience with suspense (the nail-biting kind), intrigue (the edge-of-your-seat kind), thrills (due to an excellent script with many NON-telegraphed twists and turns), terrorism, kidnapping, restrained but none-the-less powerful acting (mostly involving the director's acting troupe), etc. The black & white cinematography in ultra wide format (at least 2.35 to 1.0) is often startling with frames always fully utilized (side to side) by the Director. The music score underlines what is on the screen without drawing unnecessary attention to itself. There are many now classic cinema scenes. Those in the police station especially stand out. Every question you may have asked yourself while watching events unfold are methodically raised, explored, and addressed with reasoned discourse (by a cast of about 20 police officers and undercover investigators).

17,7 August 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,10, Akira Kurosawa uses his tremendous filmmaking talents to analyze the difference between different layers of the social and class structure.,"As the title suggests, High and Low deals a lot with class structure and it's finite importance.  This film seems to say that there are times when financial success must be set aside for the compassionate preservation of endangered human life. Kingo Gondo is a high powered executive in a prestigious Japanese shoe company, and he is approached by a group of other executives who have a plan to produce different shoes that would bring in more profits. Gondo refuses, because the proposed shoes are cheaply made and fall apart easily. He kicks them out of his house and, very soon after, he gets a call saying that his son has been kidnapped for ransom. It turns out that the kidnappers accidentally kidnapped his chauffeur's son, yet they still demand the ransom.",/

The situation which was set up was a masterful one: a man kidnaps a child whom he believes to be the son of a rich businessman, but who actually turns out to be the son of the businessman's servant. The kidnapper still insists on getting the money from the businessman. The ransom equals much, much more than the businessman can afford. So what are his choices? He can either pay the ransom and become poor, or he could indirectly kill a young child and be forever blameworthy in the eyes of the public, his associates, his son, his wife, and, most importantly, in his own eyes.

21,30 June 2012,TheLittleSongbird,10, Right up there with Kurasawa's best,"Not my favourite Akira Kurasawa film by all means, but for me definitely in the top 10 of his best films. Perhaps the final sequence is a little too safe, but it's not too much of a big problem compared to how good everything else is. Kurasawa's movies all have the advantage of being well made and directed, and High and Low is certainly no exception. The single-set scenery is both atmospheric and epic, and the cinematography is as ever exceptional. While Kurasawa's direction is one of his more subtle overall directorial jobs, it never undermines the riveting and tense feel of the always compelling story. The score is suitably haunting, and Toshiro Mifune's lead performance is very brooding.",f

There's so many things Kurosawa does right in this film, pure brilliance. High and Low is about an executive of a Yokohama shoe company who becomes a victim of extortion when his chauffeur's son is kidnapped by mistake and held for ransom. But it's so much more than that, because of the themes Kurosawa used in the film, High and Low dissects its characters through a diptych construction, involving its audience in a wealth of human drama to contemplate Kurosawa's most prevalent, lingering questions about humanity and the factors that prevent us from relating to one another.",t

Sure - it's a masterpiece, influential yada yada yada. But boy is it boring. Same goes for High and low. Sure, one could say it's an old movie, but old doesn't necessarily equals boring. Fritz Lang's M is much older and waay more fun to watch. High and low is very well filmed and extremely well acted (like all of Kurosawas movies) but boy is it slow and boring. The pacing is one of it's weakest components. I think if an hour would've been trimmed of this movie it would've helped. Anyway - worth the watch, but stock up on beer. It'll help.",_

28,15 April 2014,Hitchcoc,9, No Samurai,"This film took time to engage my interest. It starts with a group of shoe company executives, arguing about the future of the company. Mr. Gondo, played by Toshiro Mifune, finds has managed to accumulate enough of the company to take control and move in a whole new direction. He mortgages himself up to his ears, but knows the future is bright and he will recoup his money with patience and creativity. Just as he is about to make his move, a horrible incident occurs. He receives a call from a kidnapper, saying his son has been abducted. Strangely, the boy appears a few moments later, but it is revealed that his chauffeur's son has actually been taken because he was wearing some of the other boy's clothes. The kidnapper asks for a huge amount of money for the return of the boy. The responsibility falls on Mr. Gondo, who, if he complies, will fall into ruin. If he refuses, he will be shamed forever, as will his family. The police are involved throughout, but must play by the rules. The likable Gondo is in a no win situation. This is an excellent movie, with many twists and turns, wonderful cinematography, all amid the cultural realities of the Japanese culture. We are also given a tour of the drug trade and its implications. This is more psychological cinema than police drama, though it has parts of both. An excellent film from one of the greatest directors of all time.",r

I've heard lots of favorable reviews and pleasant words about Kurosawa since I just started getting into the world of movies over 20 years ago and it took me almost as much to watch the first one of his works - ""Seven samurai"" (1954) which I found pretty boring at times, considering its length of over 3 hours, but very entertaining nonetheless. After that I knew where most of the Hollywood directors took the inspiration for their big budget ensemble cast blockbuster movies throughout the years - it was Kurosawa they were trying to copy and pay homage to. After a streak of less impressive movies of his I've discovered ""The hidden fortress"" (1958) which saw the director take a somewhat different approach and the comedy direction he had chosen I liked in an instant but once again it was overly long - the fact that didn't allow me to enjoy the movie at its fullest.",

Part of the reason for that is Kurosawa's brilliant craftsmanship, and part of it is in how different the various segments of this movie are from one another, despite them all fitting together so well. The opening scenes feature a shoe executive (Toshiro Mifune) facing the ethical dilemma of making a ransom decision, since the stakes are so high for him.

Kurosawa deftly weaves a tightly-plotted police drama with observations about capitalism and social inequality without ever being 'preachy' or overly simplistic. Mifune is excellent as the executive caught in a fiscal no-win scenario, go broke paying the ransom or go broke due to public backlash if he puts money ahead of a child's life (note: that is a highly simplified synopsis).

The mystery and eminently realistic atmosphere surrounding the film's story-which is greatly achieved thanks to its extraordinarily written screenplay-is gruesomely gripping.

It can be enjoyed on several levels: as a classic police procedural, or for the complex moral issues involved in businessman Toshiro Mifune's decision whether or not to gamble a fortune by paying a kidnapper who mistakenly stole his chauffeur's young son instead of his own. The film begins slowly, confined to Mifune's luxury home perched high above the city, but opens up with (literally) the speed of a bullet train as the deadline for payment nears. The second half follows a long, methodical accumulation of evidence leading to a riveting manhunt, with police pursuing their quarry through the blighted warrens of Yokohama's underworld.

50,22 April 2008,theowinthrop,10, The Forgotten Kurasawa - the Director of Modern Society Stories,I guess that it is impossible for some directors to be separated from the film they are most associated with.

Hitchcock is always associated with suspense and mystery...and with reason his best films being in those genres. But he did do (for better or worse) MR. AND MRS.

Gondo, (Toshiro Mifune) an executive at the National Shoe Company is having problems with his fellow executives at work. They are insisting that they should start making shoes at a lower cost (and therefore lower quality) while Gondo, having served 30 years with the company wants to continue to make quality shoes at a slightly higher price. They threaten to join forces in a coup to force him out of the company unless he complies with their directives. What they didn't realize is that Gondo had been spending the last couple of months securing 50 million yen by mortgaging everything he owns in order to buy a controlling share of stock. Just hours before making this deal, Gondo and his wife receive the distressing news that their son has been kidnapped, and is being held for a 30 million ransom. When their son turns up mere minutes after the phone call, it is soon realized that it wasn't their son that was kidnapped, but their houseman's young son instead, and Gondo has to choose between personal and financial ruin, and saving the life of the young boy.",

The camera is unflinching throughout, and Kurosawa's superb sense of composition is clear as the opening scenes play out in long, static shots that are nonetheless fascinating to watch. It's the actions/reactions of the characters that keep us riveted, and Kurosawa never cheapens the emotional impact by intercutting to the traditional close up reaction shots that, in less capable hands, would be belaboring the point that something that has occurred or is being said is of ""great significance."" We are VOYEURS, and Kurosawa ""the director"" never intrudes. I have yet to see a Kurosawa film that didn't impress me in some fashion, and HIGH AND LOW is one of his best.",

I admire many of Kurosawa's techniques but I don't connect. High and Low is the first of his modern day films I've seen since Ikiru many years ago and although they're as respected but not as popular as his samurai films, I think I've found the niche where I love Kurosawa. The first hour is set in one place, boasting a riveting moral dilemma ripe for the textbooks. It's a fascinating psychological study to watch how protagonist Mr. Gondo's behaviour differs between the threat of holding his son hostage to the actual threat of holding an employee's son hostage, thanks to Toshiro Mifune's great performance.

Like a (long) episode of dragnet, we follow the cops around as they follow up on leads. And so many cops available for this one case! There must not have been much crime in japan in 1963. It's good. Much discussion of doing the right thing, once we figure out what the right thing is. Life puts us in odd situations, and we play the hand we're dealt.

60,19 August 2022,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, Heaven and hell...,"Like its title, 'High and Low (1963)' is a film of two halves. The first, set in an air-conditioned hilltop house overlooking the city, is almost like a stage play, its single location and limited cast making the most out of the intensity surrounding its inciting incident. The second, set amidst the sweaty streets of the city itself, opens up considerably, following a meticulous police investigation that eventually culminates in a sequence that leans further into horror than you'd ever expect. Though the initial protagonist is almost entirely absent in the second movement, the picture doesn't lose any of its momentum, naturally evolving rather than morphing into something else altogether. The genres, or at least approaches, of the two halves are arguably entirely different, but they feed into each other in a natural way that compounds their necessity. The piece is surprisingly compelling given how much of it focuses on dry detective work, including the detailed listing of evidence and pain-staking stakeouts that span what almost feels like tens of minutes. Kurosawa is a great director, with his excellent use of blocking being especially noticeable. This is the first non-period piece of his I've seen and it's every bit as successful as his potentially more iconic work. Both of its halves are almost equally compelling, and its construction is generally great overall. Mifune is as good as ever, his angry growling remaining as effortlessly epic as it ever has been. There is also a really strong sense of still-relevant theme underlying the entire affair. The final scene, which I won't spoil, is a nice bit of denouement that's usually omitted in this type of older movie. Ultimately, this is an entertaining and interesting affair that takes its time but uses it wisely. It's pretty great.",

(though they could work on their tailing abilities!) And the use of the pink smoke in a black-and-white movie is well done!

Though the setup is extremely deliberate, the film really picks up with the feverish pursuit of the criminal, with some laudable acting all around. Kurosawa deftly touches upon the economic divisions within Japan at the time as well as the sociological ills (heroine) facing the youth at the time. While Kurosawa's labored pedantry sometimes works against it, this is solidly directed/acted picture and a great nod to the film noir of the 1940s and 50s. However, I would more highly recommend Kurosawa's other detective film 'Stray Dog' which I felt was slightly stronger. ",

73,10 January 2012,MartinTeller,10, High and Low,"More proof that Kurosawa can do a contemporary crime thriller as well as any American, and better than most. Although quite long (much lengthier than the average noir) it never feels gratuitously slow and the plot develops at a brisk, natural pace. The police procedural elements are some of the the finest and most compelling I've ever seen (as sharp and gripping as any American noir), with a fantastic attention to detail and thorough detective work. Individual moments stick with you forever: the pink smoke, the image of the child and his captor as the train rockets past, the haunting ""dope alley"" sequence and the incredible coda. The sense of sweltering heat is palpable throughout, with fans constantly blowing and actors wiping sweat from their brows (or even their armpits). Music is also used very well, and only when it really adds something to the scene. Kurosawa's best film in a modern setting, and one of his best overall.

I watch a lot of old movies and I think this is one of the good movies of the twentieth century and also the best Japanese movie (non-animated). If you do not like Akira Kurosawa samurai films like me, do not think that High and Low is like them, this film is better than all the films of this director. Of course, the tastes are different, but I promise you, if you like Alfred Hitchcock's films, you will definitely like this film as well.

And the ending must surely rank among the finest in cinema history.

82,18 October 2008,Cosmoeticadotcom,10, Masterpiece,"High And Low (Tengoku To Jigoku; literally Heaven And Hell) is a film that is so perfect in every detail it shows how utterly silly similar Hollywood takes on the matter are, and were: think Ron Howard's and Mel Gibson's silly 1996 flick Ransom, or any of Alfred Hitchcock's crime dramas from the 1950s or 1960s. Yes, critics often resort to the copout that Hitchcock was not deep, but technically was great. True, to a degree, but one need only watch the rail car sequence in this film to see how staid, old fashioned, conservative, and utterly quaint Hitchcock's ideas on crime were. The truth is that Hitchcock really had no idea what drove criminals. Kurosawa did. To the Englishman, crimes were Freudian impelled, and committed by people with manifest things wrong with them. The claim he made was one merely had to be adept at spotting such things. Kurosawa shows that crime (as it does in reality) emerges from complex and obscure things. Its evildoers are often manifestly plain and their reasons never discernible. What drives High And Low to such greatness is that, even after all is revealed, the criminal apprehended, and the film at an end, the viewer is still pondering- in the best sense, and still unable to grasp how and why such a thing occurred. Yet, the film only gets to that point after peerless artistic and technical means.",

The second half of the film goes into great detail as it examines the ensuing police procedure as they dedicate all their workforce into finding the kidnapper.

109,12 May 2012,Koundinya,10, You cannot break a man who accepts his fate!,"The movie begins at Kingo Gondo's hilltop mansion in the city of Tokyo. Kingo Gondo is an executive at National Shoes. The board of directors approach him to gain his support to vote out the existing chairman of the firm and also try to lure Gondo by offering him a post. Gondo, who's been in the trade for 30 years refuses to collude with them and rubbishes the idea of making cheaper and lesser durable, yet stylish footwear. After the not-so-gentle men leave, Gondo brings to the notice of his wife and his loyal assistant that he had a plan of taking over the company and that he had raised 50 million yen by mortgaging his property and it would really be a dream come true. Gondo receives an anonymous phone call saying his son had been kidnapped and the kidnapper demands 30 million yen as ransom. Gondo calls the police and explains the situation. The police tap his phone and try to trace the calls, in vain. After contemplating overnight, Gondo refuses to pay ransom as it would shatter his dreams of the owning the company where he started his career as an intern. His wife, the chauffeur and the police convince him that he'd certainly lose his image as a gentleman when people get to know of this and convince him that he has to pay up the cash which would later be reclaimed by the police once they arrest the culprit. The kidnapper asks Gondo to take the second bullet train that leaves Tokyo in the morning and wait for further instructions. The clever kidnapper asks Gondo to make sure no two notes are in succession. Gondo places chemicals that emit a stench when thrown in water or give out pink fumes when burnt, along with the cash in the briefcases . Gondo, aboard the train, receives a call from the kidnapper asking him to drop off the briefcases in which he had kept the cash at a bridge, after which he could come and pick up the boy. He does as instructed.",

112,8 May 2020,g-96059,7, great,"Audiences will find kurosawa's central theme in the English title High and Low. In the opening scene of the film, shot from above, the cityscape of yokohama, a city that has been devastated and rebuilt by earthquakes, wars, and twice, kurosawa's choice of location was not an accident. In the 1960s, Japan gradually began to recover its economy and bid farewell to the bitterness and depression of wartime life. Akira kurosawa began making a series of socially problematic films in the 1960s, echoing earlier films such as the wild dog and the drunken angel. After the opening credits, we came to the home of quan teng, a shoe company. The villa was fully western-style, luxurious and elegant, and equipped with modern electrical equipment (air conditioning was still an extremely rare item in Japanese society at that time). A low Angle shot from the top shows mitsuhiro mifuna, who plays kwon teng in a close-up. He is playing a business game with the company's directors. The other directors demand that the quality of the goods be reduced and the cost reduced, but kwon teng opposes this. In this scene, kwon teng comes to the floor-to-ceiling window of the living room and opens the glass door. At this moment, we find that the original scene at the beginning of the film is a subjective shot from this Angle. The contrast between ""high"" and ""low"" is clear.",

What I like most about this film--besides the gorgeous wide-angle compositions--is the deliberateness of it; Kurasowa never rushes as he follows the police tracking their quarry, a refreshing change of pace from the frenetic quality of so many movies today.",

119,2 April 2001,yrral-3,8, A fine interpretation of Ed McBain,"Ed McBain's 87th Precinct novels seem tailor-made for movies, but there have only been a few. One of the best, oddly enough, is barely recognizable as one of McBain's police procedurals. ``High and Low'' (1963), directed by Japan's legendary Akira Kurosawa, focuses as much on the victim of the crime -- a botched kidnapping -- as on the cops' pursuit of the kidnapper. Toshiro Mifune plays a shoe-company executive who ransoms his chauffeur's son, who was mistaken for his own son by the kidnapper. Mifune thus loses the capital he needs to beat back a cabal of greedy colleagues fed up with his refusal to cheapen their products to increase profits. Instead of taking control of his company, he loses everything. As his life unravels, the police launch a full-bore offensive to catch the kidnapper, even after the boy is recovered unharmed. Kurosawa's best known for his costume dramas (``Ran,'' ``Yojimbo''), but this is one of his best movies.",

122,10 September 2015,k_aguilar1337,9, Very engaging and well crafted crime thriller. My new favorite from Kurosawa.,"My 6th Kurosawa film after Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood, Yojimbo, Ikiru, and Rashoman. High and Low is now my new favorite of the bunch. I loved the first 5 Kurosawa films I watched (with Seven Samurai and Ikiru being my top favorites), but now this takes the cake for being my new favorite Kurosawa film. With my favorite genre being crime thrillers, this one felt real special to me. Everything about it was just so brilliant and perfectly crafted, it blows my mind how Kurosawa had such an amazing consistency of the quality of his films, ranging from all genres. Kurosawa's main actor, Toshiro Mifune, absolutely killed it in this film, and only seeing in Samurai roles (Yojimbo, Seven Samurai) this was a pleasant surprise for me to see his acting range, because I've only seen him played samurai characters. I really felt for his character and the toll the main ransom took on him, his family, and his business. What I really loved about this film was the three episode structure in this film. The introduction with Mifune and the ransom, the second act with the detective work, and the final chase were all just great acts with incredible tension in each one. The dialogue in this movie was constantly engaging, elevated by fantastic performances by the whole cast. And the direction is nothing less than perfect by Kurosawa. Not as epic in scope compared to his Samurai films, but I loved seeing his expert framing of shots and staging of his characters in the city setting. The whole train sequence was done beautifully. What I also love in these Kurosawa films is the humor in these films, very witty and let's the audience relax especially because the films are so high of tension and drama. High and Low is now a new 10/10 in my list of films. Definitely check this film out if you love foreign cinema, crime thrillers, or just good cinema in general. I'm really excited to check out more of Kurosawa's non samurai work.",

124,20 July 2020,nimstic,9, A beautiful afterthought...,"Anyone who loves good films know very well what to expect from Kurosawa - a screen magician. In High & Low too, he pulls his usual mindblowing tricks with the same set of resources accessible to any other director as we sit watching in awe the visual treat that unfolds in front of our eyes. The story may seem a bit predictable at first but Kurosawa swiftly turns it into a meaningful, immersive quest. Toshiro Mifune brings in his usual intensity and a unique sensitivity, unlike Kikuchiyo (Seven Samurai) or Yojimbo, that is so human. What an actor. Also a delight to watch Tatsuya Nakadai who mesmerised us in Harakiri, as the lead cop. He displays a calm, sincere demeanor and persists with the clever kindnapper's chase with inspiring sense of grounding - a great front end to the police procedures that we often don't see in such films. As a matter of fact, we often iconize bad policemen and disregard many who do their duties sincerely - because they simply followed the norm. On a side note - a bit surprised to see another great actor Takashi Shimura in a very small role. As usual, some scenes would stay with you for a long time - such as the comment made by a deputy policemen on the way Mifune's house appears so prominently on the hill and the scene of Mifune working in the garden after the boy was rescued. Of course, the intense ending scene and articulating the meaninglessness of everything we saw thus far, the fagility of our values and ideas of life. To me, the film felt better after I finished watching it - the reason could be that, it made me think about our life's pursuits, the conventions we hold so close to our heart... I felt just like Mifune sitting at the prison window confronting his tormentor. Great movie!",

127,3 June 2001,windawg1,10, Flawless.,"""Tengoku to jigoku"" is the epitome of police procedural films.  Akira Kurosawa blessed cinema with ""Tengoku to jigoku""(literally, Heaven and Hell) in 1963 and it withstood the test of time.  Known as ""High and Low"" in the USA, ""Tengoku to jigoku"" belongs in the same group of timeless film-noir classics as ""The Third Man,"" ""Touch of Evil,"" and ""The Maltese Falcon."" There are no weak points in the story or the film itself.  The legendary Toshiro Mifune plays a wealthy shoe manufacturer who gets involved in a complex kidnapping.  The pacing fits the narrative perfectly---""Sanjuro,"" another Kurosawa film, seemed like it was longer and it was more than forty minutes shorter.  Watch ""Tengoku to jigoku"" and be captivated.",

131,29 May 2019,jackamccallum,9, A Superb and Subtle Kurosawa Film,High and Low is a smart slow burning film with constant twists and turns and is my personal favorite of Akira Kurosawa's films (I haven't seen them all so that may change). High and Low has an amazing premise and philosophical dilemma at its core. It is shot with subtlety and nuance with expert blocking as if watching a play. the acting is superb with all the characters having strong motivations and with the audience easily being able to see what a certain character is thinking at any given time. The first two acts are magnificent but the third act has a long prolonged scene throughout the streets of Japan that feels tedious but the final scene more than makes up for it. The film is not for everyone but if you are a fan of Kurosawa's other work you should give it a watch to see a new side of the incredible director,
132,4 October 2004,dvdfile,9, Best detective film ever,"The one line summary I have given is misleading. It isn't just a detective film, and perhaps, that is why it is the best. Miscreants kidnap a shoe merchant's car driver's son, mistaking him for the shoe merchant's. From then on, its Kurosawa. The problem with a detective film is that the we, generally, would have seen it all. But here, Kurosawa weaves a gripping story from quite mundane situations. Toshiro Mifune, without his sword, and as Gondo, the shoe businessman, is superb. Technically, the film is accomplished. But the tour-de-force is the reason for the crime. Brilliant!",
133,2 April 2020,MomoFuzz,8, Classic for a reason,"I got interested in High and Low after hearing that Bong Joon-Ho was inspired by this film when making Parasite. And indeed, this was another great film about capitalism and class disparity. And like all effective critiques, High and Low simply provides a viewpoint and an observation, allowing the audience to find meaning from it. I enjoyed the subtle characterization of Gondo that breathed authenticity to the movie. The class conflict, in seemed, was not only in the main narrative but also within Gondo's mind: Gondo the poor shoe-making apprentice vs. the selfmade capitalist businessman. One noble and empathetic, but the other ruthless and daring.",
134,2 August 2000,Kevin Gillette,9, Interesting adaptation of English-language novel,"I remember seeing this film when I was 8 years old, in 1969.  I was fascinated by the depth of the acting and the intrigue of the crime-solving. As an adult, I have a strong affinity for the Ed McBain 87th Precinct police procedural novels.  I was astonished to see that the film was actually a very stylized adaptation of one of McBain's novel, ""A King's Ransom."" Though the film plot and venue depart rather rapidly from McBain's story, the film sets itself apart as yet another masterpiece in the Kurosawa oeuvre.  Whereas McBain wrote his story in the truest of ""pulp fiction"" styles, the film is artistic, spare (compare with ""Seven Samurai""), and deeply compelling.  Kurosawa's many collaborations with lead Toshiro Mifune have always been splendid examples of film craft.  This film, with its poignance and frequently scathing social commentary (""haves"" vs. ""have nots""), sits firmly in the pantheon of great (and highly underrated) filmmaking.",
135,4 July 2015,donaldsgordon,8, Ethical questions mixed into a taut police procedural,"Kurosawa was known as a great humanist, and ethical questions clearly play a central role in each thread of the plot. Kingo Gondo (played by Toshiro Mifune) is a director on the board of a company called National Shoes. He is approached by three other directors, who want to overthrow the current president, and start producing a new line of shoes. Gondo agrees that the president is old-fashioned, but he rejects the shoes they show him as shoddily made. He ejects them from his house, only to get a phone call from a kidnapper who claims to have taken his son. His son turns up, but his friend the chauffeur's son is gone. Even after the kidnapper realizes his mistake, he insists that the ransom still be paid. Gondo had been planning to use the money to fight off the take-over bid, so the police immediately wonder if the other directors have orchestrated the kidnapping in order to deprive Gondo of the cash he needs to stop them. The chauffeur, Gondo's wife and the police are all reticent to put too much pressure on Gondo to pay the ransom, but it is clear he must make a choice: to save the boy or fend off the take-over.",

Aoki moves closer and closer...Mifune can't get out of the room so he paces furiously into the curtains. Amazing. The second hour is a bit more derivative, but entertaining nonetheless.

145,30 December 2006,extrauterina,10, It's the first Kurosawa/Mifune non-samurai movie I've seen,"I've already seen ""Shichinin no samurai"" and ""Rashomon"", but ""Tengoku to jigoku"" is the first non-samurai movie directed by Kurosawa and starred by Toshiro Mifune that I've seen. At first I wasn't sure what to expect, especially in the first scene of the movie when directors of National Shoes talked about shoes and what is the best for their company and all that made me smile because it made me think of Al Bundy :) Anyhow, very soon I realized the idea of this movie is more serious (which I was expecting to be) when directors started arguing themselves and finally when the whole kidnapping and ransom process started. From that point on I was thrilled by watching Toshiro Mifune and his portrait of Mr. Gondo - a very concerned man because he had to make a choice between his work and wealth on one hand and his family and sympathy on the other. I was also very thrilled how Kurosawa presented work of Japanese police and the way they were solving the case. The images and shots of drug addicted men and women in the poor parts of major cities in Japan are also very memorable. In conclusion I can only say that now I am an even bigger fan of Kurosawa and I am looking forward to see another of his masterpieces so I gave this movie 10/10.",

148,7 July 2014,paleiff,8, More High than Low.,"Though High and Low is a great film in its own right and a shining example of Akira Kurosawa's genius and the success of this structural experiment, the stunningly canvassed characters with their layers and depth, wonderful performances, fluid camera-work and beautifully lit sets. The film does not rank amongst the best of Kurosawa's body of work; the ending in many ways felt unresolved or at least resolved to an extent but in an unsatisfying manner. Gondo makes the choice which he feels is the moral decision and gives away all he owns to save another's child and forgoes his opportunity to own the company he has given his blood, sweat and tears to. Even though the boy lives, they catch the kidnappers and most of Gondo's money is recovered and returned to him, it's not enough. His house and all of his belongings are repossessed and he has to start all over again. But in saying that isn't that Kurosawa's point? How much do we actually need, how much is enough and how much of what we own and posses is just overindulgence? The social commentaries made by Kurosawa fifty years ago still ring true today in the modern economic climate. Lessons can be taken from the film through both perspectives of the class spectrum; the rich would not exist without the poor and vice verse. But if equality is ever to be reached society must find a way to bridge the gap between the class', perhaps if the wealthy took a a page from Gondo's book and made a sacrifice that would be a start.",
