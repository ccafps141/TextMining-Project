I had heard of Yasujiro Ozu's ""Tokyo Story"" for several years but never had an opportunity to see it until Criterion resuscitated it as part of their DVD collection. Over fifty years old, this wondrous 1953 film resonates just as deeply today. Those outside Japan rarely get to see a Japanese film classic that doesn't involve samurai warriors in medieval battles. This one, however, is a subtly observed family drama set in post-WWII Japan, and it is the quietude and lack of pretense of Ozu's film-making style that makes this among the most moving of films.",/
1,22 March 2004,Galina_movie_fan,9, Universal appeal of Tokyo Story,"As with every great work, the film has its own unique perfection in style, rhythm, details, and artist's vision - but Tokyo Story is very universal in its appeal - it is for every parent, every son or daughter - for everyone. It was made 50 years ago in Japan, about people who lived far away, but it is also about all of us, our families, our problems, our guilt and our search for love and meaning.",r

3,8 April 2007,GyatsoLa,10, A cinema of tears,"I can vividly remember the first time i saw this movie - it was during a festival of Japanese movies in an art house cinema here in Dublin. I must admit to never having heard of Ozu before, i went out of boredom and casual curiosity. I was embarrassed at the end to find myself in tears. I quickly wiped them away in that subtle way guys do when they don't want anyone to know, and got out to leave. What struck me was that even as the credits were finishing, I was one of the first to go. As i walked up the aisle I realized that most of the nearly full cinema was still sitting quietly, without the usual post movie chatter - and more than half of the audience had tears pouring down their faces. I have never, ever witnessed that in a cinema.",v
4,8 March 2013,TheLittleSongbird,10, Beautiful and deeply moving,"Why did it take so long for me to see this film? I don't know why that is, other than being behind with my movie watching due to studying, and I am still kicking myself because Tokyo Story was one of the best films I've seen in quite some time. I haven't seen enough of Yasujiro Ozu's work to judge him as an overall director, but seeing Tokyo Story it is very easy to see why anybody would consider it one of his finest achievements or him as a master film-maker. Tokyo Story is beautifully shot, everything looks homely and evocative and the shots, frame and cinematography are done to perfection. And Ozu directs very sensitively and assuredly, it is said that he specialised in middle-class family melodramas and I have no trouble believing that. The story is quiet and meditatively paced but never bored me, because every bit of writing, family scene and character was dealt with in such a poignant and intelligent manner. Tokyo Story is also helped by some truly wonderful acting. Setsuko Hara just epitomises gentle kindness, making us warm to Noriko easily, while Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama play their roles with nuanced and affecting dignity. In conclusion, a beautiful and deeply moving film in all respects. 10/10 Bethany Cox",i
5,14 May 2002,KFL,9, The excuses we make to justify our neglect of others,"An appreciation of this movie may demand some understanding of Japanese culture. The Japanese are rather reserved, and were even more reserved back in the early 1950's, when this film is set. No embracing, even of parents, children, siblings; no dramatic histrionics; even a death scene in this movie is much quieter than a Westerner might expect.",e
6,16 November 2020,Hitchcoc,10, Just Too Real,"An elderly Japanese couple come to Tokyo to visit children and grandchildren. From the beginning, we get a sense that they are looked at as a nuisance, even though they have not seen their family for years. While they visit, the children are hard pressed to take a little time for them. We see that they have settled into their lives (rather depressing lives) and into themselves. The kindest person is a young woman who the widow of one of the sons. She is kind an compassionate. True, not a lot happens, but as we go through the two hours, it is painful how tense things are and what an edge there is. I've seen these kinds of relationships in my extended family and in the families of others. This is a very well constructed film.",w

8,27 October 1999,Stroheim-3,10, FANTASTIC,"I need to say this:  THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!  Sure it starts off slowly, but the fact of the matter is the film is a great story of a family and the alienation associated with aging.  This is the kind of movie that will make you reflect upon your own family and how you treat them.",r
9,17 June 2002,bobbie-16,10, beautiful meditation on old age and family; simple and moving,"I can't take my mind off this movie. The story is both universally human (old age, the end of life, parents and children) and specifically Japanese. The movie tells the viewer so much about Japanese middle class life in the 1950s: eating and sleeping; mourning the war dead; clothes and home furnishings; spoiled kids; a doctor's office; a schoolroom; life in Tokyo and small towns; how family members talk to each other; old men's drinking habits; a resort hotel. But while we see all these details of a real time and place, we are constantly drawn into reflection on the meaning of human life and relationships. The reflection emerges effortlessly from the simple narrative and the specifics. The director never annoyingly tells us how to feel, he is not preaching and not drawing attention to himself. (There is none of that ""hey, I'm making a moving movie"" crud that you get in Hollywood treatment of these topics). He just lets the story unfold in a quiet, natural way. It's not for folks who only like ""action"" movies. I put ""action"" in quotes because this movie is about the real action in life--enjoying life, sharing it with others, facing the end of it.",w
10,14 July 2004,spqrclaudius,10, Extraordinary Portrayal of Real Life,"A fantastic film that belies the simplicity of its plot, Tokyo Story is the tale of a vacation gone sadly awry, with an elderly man and woman visiting from the countryside pushed to the sidelines by their busy children in the city. The younger generation (and by extension the ""new"" Japan) turns its back on the family from which it arose- because of selfishness, because of necessity, or because it's simply the way of the world. The movie provides no easy answers- its melancholy ambiguity is part of its charm. Whatever the case, Ozu delights in portraying the details of everyday life. The emotional resonances of this movie are extraordinary, and some shots (a child picking flowers, an old couple framed by the sea, a woman sitting forlornly at her work desk) are enough to give a sensitive film-goer the shivers. Despite the testimony of some critics, the film is not totally devoid of melodramatic elements (some stock characters and cloying musical motifs spring readily to mind), but the film is founded upon such an obvious love and respect for the importance of real-world interactions that it's hard not to be anything other than enthralled by it.",5

They decide to travel in a long voyage by train to Tokyo to visit their children, the doctor Koichi Hirayama (Sô Yamamura) and the hairdresser Shige Kaneko (Haruko Sugimura). However, Koichi and Shige can not afford time to spend with their parents but the widow sister-in-law Noriko Hirayama (Setsuko Hara) gives attention to them and go on sightseeing through Tokyo with the old couple. Shukishi and Tomi note that their children do not have time for them and they decide to return to Onomichi.

From Kurosawa and Mizugochi to more modern filmmakers like Kobayashi and Nagisa Oshima and Shishihara. Yet Ozu, like a detached taffeta of them all, deserves the title of the most Japanese filmmaker in the history of cinema.

14,3 November 2016,elvircorhodzic,9, Life is simple and unique. That's very true.,"TOKYO STORY is a film that has a moderate tone, unobtrusive style and quiet family story. An elderly couple from the provinces coming to Tokyo to visit their grown children. The story shows how the children, preoccupied with their daily lives, do not show enough care for their parents, as opposed to the former daughter-whose husband died in the war. At first glance, everything in this film seems simple and clear, but on the other hand is a sensitive topic and family discord, somewhat generational conflict with fairly deep emotions without excessive melodrama.",5
15,1 July 2005,planktonrules,8, exceptionally crafted but depressing,"This is a marvelous movie with exceptional acting throughout. However, it is also INCREDIBLY bleak and sad, so be forewarned!!! The story begins with an older Japanese couple (grandma and grandpa) packing to go to Tokyo to see their grown son, daughter and daughter-in-law (whose husband, their 2nd son, was killed in the war). However, despite their letting everyone know they were coming, they are treated as inconveniences. The only one who showed them any consideration was the daughter-in-law. Particularly disgusting was their daughter, who ALWAYS told her husband to spend LESS on her parents, as they wouldn't know any better. Lovely kids, huh?! Anyways, after spending their time in Tokyo, they return to their hometown and grandma becomes deathly ill. You can probably guess where this is going. Despite all this, the grandparents continually say they've got good kids, even though they seem like selfish jerks.",3

17,16 August 2006,Quinoa1984,10," I need to see it again even after two times; a beautiful mix of simplicity, nuance, style and humility","I was shown Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story- my first Ozu film- in an Art-film class some years ago, and I watched it again a couple of months ago. This has to be a truly indelible Japanese film, even to those who might dismiss it dimly as 'slow' or one where nothing happens. Actually, if you're going by traditional plot, not a lot does happen. But then again, not a lot happens on Seinfeld, either. In fact, maybe on repeat viewings, this could become the serene, Japanese tragic-comic equivalent of Seinfeld. After two viewings I get the 'jist' of the characters, their simple objectives and how they live their lives, but there's still much that can be taken in, it's hard to describe. While I'm not sure I've seen one of the ten best films ever made, as it has been for some critics and audiences, I do think it's a very unique film, one that moves in a way akin to an Italian neo-realist film, but filmed with a very particular eye that sets it apart from them.",/

19,20 July 2010,Koyama22,10, A meditative masterpiece,"I first watched Tokyo Story in a classroom some time ago and witnessed something curious. I have never seen a group of people so choked up over a film, ever. The most curious thing about it though is that most could not place what exactly made them so emotional. There are moments in Tokyo Story in which you are hit with a wall of emotions, surprised and overwhelmed that this simple little film could evoke such feelings. It's something about the characters, the honesty, the way everything hits home despite the cultural and time-period barriers.",r
20,19 February 2015,lasttimeisaw,9, My first Ozu's masterpiece,"The omission of Ozu's oeuvre is definitely an unerring embarrassment for any movie aficionado, thankfully TOKYO STORY comes to my rescue, presumably Ozu's most renowned work, tellingly it merits all kudos it gets, gracefully scrutinizing the post-WWII mental disposition of Japanese people, and quietly tear-jerking in eliciting recollections and rumination between parents and their children. Parenthood is not for everyone, but we all have parents, we forever hold a sense of regret towards them, especially in the oriental culture, filial piety is the foremost virtue to measure an individual's worth, at least viewed by other family members.",e

22,27 November 2012,Slime-3,5, Somehow Not The Best Film Of All-Time One Is Often Led To Believe,"Labelling something 'the best ever' or even a more moderated 'one of the best...' is surely asking for trouble? But in the case of TOKYO STORY it would be difficult to imagine the film causing any kind of trouble at all as this very measured, courteous movie is such an inoffensive and charming offering. However it's not, in my view, anything remotely like 'the best ever'. It's a nice little film, in it's way, but I do wonder why on earth it has developed such a huge reputation? It's sad, it's endearing, it's sometimes rather beautiful and it's melancholic almost throughout, but it's also very predictable;nothing remotely unexpected happens, one can see things being flagged up well in advance. It's very slow and made in a very tightly confined way which hasn't really influenced subsequent movies half as much as some people would like to think.So what makes it considered ""one of the best""?

23,4 August 2012,madbeast,6, Stunningly over-rated,"I finally saw this film after Site & Sound Magazine rated it as the third greatest film ever made in their once-a-decade list.

25,18 May 2003,lqualls-dchin,10, Considered Ozu's masterpiece,"""Tokyo Story"" is considered Ozu's masterpiece; it continues to be one of the most widely admired of Ozu's films, and one of the most immediately accessible. The theme of the disintegration of a family as a microcosm of societal changes is one which is universal: this is the theme of Ford's ""How Green Was My Valley"", of Welles's ""The Magnificent Ambersons"", of Satyajit Ray's ""The Music Room"", but Ozu is able to tell his story without the usual paraphernalia of melodrama. The story unfolds in an almost lifelike fashion, and we in the audience feel as if we are eavesdropping on this family. Gradually, small details and little incidents build, until such scenes as the widowed daughter-in-law's confession of loneliness create an overwhelming empathy.",t
26,24 December 2004,aakostar,8, Very interesting movie however it needs some patience from the moviegoer,Tokyo monogatari (or Tokyo Story) is a very human story. It contains a lot of everyday life which at times can make it difficult to follow since it may feel a little bit slow.,_
27,26 April 2014,bandw,8, Prototypical Ozu,"Mathematicians have a saying, ""Happiness is proving the same theorem over and over again,"" by which is meant that proving a significant result early on allows for embellishing, extending, and recasting the result in different contexts for almost a whole career. If Ozu had been a mathematician, I suspect he would have understood this idea. I have seen five Ozu movies and they all seem to be variations on a theme, that theme being an examination of the family dynamics of a particular Japanese family, frequently highlighting the frictions between generations and concerns about parents marrying off their daughters.",u
28,7 November 2020,dromasca,10, parents and children,"Yasujirô Ozu's 'Tokyo Story' was made in 1953, the year of my birth. 67 years have passed since then, the film is the same age as me. It addresses a recurring theme of Ozu's creation - the disintegration of the family structure under the pressure of the evolution of modern society (some call it progress). It is a film about the relationships between parents and children, about caring for the elderly and caring for those who come after us, about the time we dedicate to the family, about love and loneliness. Today, when I also have in care my 90-year-old mother, when I am a father and a grandfather, this film is perfectly actual for me and talks about situations that I experienced and feelings and emotions I went through in my life, which started in the year the movie was made. At the same time, it is a film that describes more eloquently than a library of historical books the situation of Japan eight years after the end of the war that changed the course of history and reshaped the character of the nation. The characterization of ""Tokyo Story' as one of the best films ever made is not exaggerated.",r

Other than the fact that they're poor after WW2 ended, 1954 was probably the best Japanese film year to date. The 3 greatest directors of Japan, Kenji Mizoguchi, Akira Kurosawa, and Yasujiro Ozu, release by far their greatest creations. (Although Ugetsu was 1953, Sansho the Baliff was also great) Oh and I forgot that GODZILLA was also 1954 too. There's no denying Japanese Cinema was at their peak in 1954. There was Seven Samurai, Sansho the Baliff, Godzilla, and then there's Tokyo Story which is the film we're going to focus on today.",

36,8 May 2018,shakercoola,9, A tragedy of distraction,"A Japanese drama; A story about an elderly man and his wife, who take the long journey from their small seaside village to visit their adult children in Tokyo. They don't have much time to spend with them, and so it falls to the widow of their younger son to keep her in-laws company.
The film is a triumph of cross-generational familial truth, a poignant, honest and humbling drama about parenthood. It's lost none of its power over the years. Ozu observes human nature and doesn't pass comment or sentimentalize the story. The director paints in delicate watercolour emotions, in which the viewer glimpses pain and joy, tenderness and mystery from simplicity and reticence. The central question is universal: How do we look after our elderly parents as they confront all manner of emotions about their own deaths?",
37,8 September 2018,alansabljakovic-39044,9, Wonderful movie,After watching this movie I realized how I don't respect my parents enough and this ending could happen to all of us.

The director broke the 180 degree rule, the camera just about never moves, and it is always either at eye level or on the ground.

I was told by my ex-Japanese teacher about 5 years ago back in secondary school that it was one of the most beautiful films ever made. I was only just getting into foreign cinema (i.e. anything not from Hollywood really) and wasn't sure what to expect and I wasn't willing to take the risk of being possibly bored to death with ""old classics"".

No greater example of this could be given than by comparing the films of two of the greatest filmmakers from Japan. Of course, most people have heard of Akira Kurosawa and his classics like Seven Samurai, Rashomon, and Ikiru. But there is also Yasujiro Ozu (1903-1963), whose canon of films is set in modern times far more often than Kurosawa's. Where Kurosawa was grand, Ozu is small. Where Kurosawa was kinetic, Ozu was static. Where Kurosawa celebrated the epic, Ozu celebrated the ordinary. Yet, despite their differences, their greatest films are indisputable masterpieces of cinema, even if they achieve their ends in seemingly contradictory ways.",

46,19 August 2008,imdbfriend,10," Life is disappointing, but not this movie!","The film tells the story of aged parents visiting their children in Tokyo and depicts the treatment they receive from them on the visit. The beauty of the movie lies in its simplicity, be it the story itself or the storytelling style of the legendary Ozu, or the acting by the cast members who all draws a very thin line between acting/ reality and most of the time their performance are on the side of reality. It is very easy here to see the treatment of the children as they grow old towards their aging parents, yet barring few scenes we don't see children as villains but rather persons with their own family, work, and life in big city and very less time to take care of their parents. Few scenes towards the end actually clears all the air of confusion in our mind in taking children as villain and we all get to know their traits and there's nothing but hate left in us for them. Throughout the movie we also see the fine daughter-in law of these old couple and what a Good Samaritan she is treating her in laws as her own parents even after the death of her husband. Direction by Ozu is brilliant and I instantly became fan and just waiting for the opportunity to explore some other movies of this master of cinema. Overall, I would say this is one of the simplest yet powerful and best pictures of all time. The movie though more than half century old still owns significance in present time. A must see.",
47,23 September 2004,knowles9165,10, Perfection,"In this film Ozu explores and shows great respect for the small, private suffering in each of our lives. He does this in the most UNsentimental way, but rather, is relentlessly mindful of the details and subtlety in the process of accepting facts beyond our control. Ozu has no resistance to the truth of regret and loss. There is no manic or depressive struggle, but a slow gaze over a beautiful horizon. He takes us to an emotional sanctuary where we can observe without averting our eyes. Ozu does not try to jerk our feelings around or deliberately set out to make us cry. He does not try to dazzle us intellectually or do anything creative or new. Rather he simply shows us an idealized transformation through stages of life where we can arrive at a state of peace through acceptance of ""normal"" events. There are no bad guys or good guys here, but simple declarations about life in the most monumentally unadorned style possible. A great, great work of art. My all-time favorite.",
48,5 April 2009,lyrxsf,9, Genius in its simplicity,"Tokyo Story is not Tokyo's story. It is the story of ageing, old age and letting go. The director's genius is in how he uses the media of film to narrate life, without diluting or manipulating it. Life is depicted as is. The movie has a slow start and the first half an hour goes by without really making much of an impression. It shows daily life – chop wood, fetch water – an old couple visiting their children in big city. Everyone has busy lives, though of course, busy is how one chooses to be. Time goes where one wants it go. At the surface, the grown-up children are concerned, but it remains at the surface. There's contrasting dialog where one person says ""you can serve your parents only till the grave"" and another says ""children have their own needs"". There's really no wrong or right. Its what is. For the mother, getting the chance to sleep in the bed of her long assumed-dead son was bigger than being shown around Tokyo city. Priorities are different and keep changing. Life has a unique way of tying different threads together. Sometime, they are left untied. There's comment on how clothes take centerstage instead of the lived/shared experience. Sense of consumption and objectifying life takes away from the deeper connection and being with the experience of living life. The daughter-in-law inherits the goodwill, while the daughter takes the goods. The movie reflects on the isolation and increasing loneliness of ageing. It ends with a sense of loss, stillness and depth – all signifying old age.",

50,27 November 2011,fa-oy,10, Ozu's best film,"One of my favorite films from Ozu, and it probably deserves to be on the top of my favorite Japanese film list. This is, in my opinion, one of his most accessible efforts, although you have to be at least used to Japanese or classic cinema in order to fully appreciate it, otherwise it is more likely that you'll find yourself not caring much about what's happening, on account of Ozu's pacing style. ",
51,24 December 2011,Artimidor,10, About things said and unsaid and everything in between - a story about life itself,"Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story is a very simple narration where nothing really spectacular happens that couldn't happen in anyone else's life. What takes place in the film is just life itself. It's about the not uncommon difficulties of generations that have to deal with each other, where natural gaps arise after the children have moved away from their parents and each family member is living a different life now - all things we might have experienced ourselves in a similar fashion from the one or the other side, or even from both. Everybody tries his/her best in their own kind of way when it comes to a visit. One means well, stays polite, but the lives the family members lead are their own now. While the parents don't want to impose on their children, the children are fine when their parents are on their way again so that things take their regular course to which they are used to.

Their daughter and son-in-law send them on a tour to Atima with all expenses paid. They enjoy their tour but after they cut short their tour and are back at their daughter's place do they realize the motive of their daughter in sending them away.

The story of the parents coming to visit their children in Tokyo and finding their children too busy and too put out to want to entertain them must have been a revelation for Japan moviegoers at the time. Nowadays, this movie cannot even be made, it would just garner shrugs. So, you have to watch this film knowing it takes place in the early 1950's, not yesterday. Although it has probably been commented on already, Setsuko Hara's portrayal of Noriko is amazing. She plays the daughter in law role perfectly. She has the perfect mixture of sweetness and awkwardness. You want to see her be happy, as she seems to be the only person who has time for the parents. You should buy the Criterion Collection version of this DVD, as it includes a documentary of the director. It is a purposely slow moving film.

Basically in the small coastal village of Onomichi, Japan, live elderly couple Shukishi (An Autumn Afternoon's Chishû Ryû) and Tomi Hirayama (Chieko Higashiyama) with their young schoolteacher daughter Kyôko (Kyôko Kagawa), their other grown up children are in various places in Tokyo or Osaka. The couple make the decision to travel to Tokyo for an extended visit to see these other adult children and their families: eldest son and paediatrician Koichi Hirayama (Sô Yamamura) and his two sons, eldest daughter and beautician Shige Kaneko (Haruko Sugimura) who runs a hairdressing salon, and they see their other son Keizo Hirayama (Shirô Osaka) with an unexpected stop in Osaka. As each of their children have Shukishi and Tomi hang around they try to adjust and cope with their visits, they are treating them with hardly any care, respect or want for them to be seeing them. They even try to stop spending time with them by trying to send them the inexpensive Atami Hot Springs resort, only daughter-in-law Noriko Hirayama (Setsuko Hara), who was made a widow when her husband Shoji killed eight years ago in the war, is making any effort and treating them nicely during their trip. As Shukishi and Tomi realise that their grown up children are not very fond of having them around, each of their offspring are realising the effects of their actions, and it may be too late to make up for their general behaviour both from the past and during the trip time, especially when Tomi dies, and Shukishi has to try to connect with them after the loss. Also starring Kuniko Miyake as Fumiko Hirayama – Koichi's wife. The performances are all fine, especially by the older two leading stars and by the actress playing the sweet daughter-in-law, it is a simple story about family who do not connect as well as they should, I will confess it was a little hard to follow what was going while having the read the subtitles as well, but what I gathered made a watchable drama.

It's an intimate family drama, but it also has an epic quality. It appears larger than it is, and its story takes on a wider scope than is literally presented on screen. It's a film about family in the context of a rapidly changing society, the relationship between generations, and the bonds forged over lifetimes that hold people together. The story takes place in post-war Japan as an aging married couple decide to leave their small town to visit their adult children in Tokyo. Once they get there, their kids barely have time for them and struggle to keep them occupied as they juggle their professional lives, daily routines, and their own children. It's a film about the cycle of life and changing perspectives. It's about the future and the past, hope and regret. And it's ultimately a film about our mortality as human beings and the importance of the time we have.

The story itself is traditional, simple, linear, slowly developing and without pronounced acts/climaxes. This has the effect of keeping you engaged evenly throughout. The performances are, however, worth mentioning to modern viewers. I personally enjoyed it, but there is a ""stagey-ness"" to some of the acting. It can't be ignored.

And this film does it as well as any other. Ozu's direction is nearly perfect. Every aspect of the film is profoundly effective. I thought the cinematography was simple, yet intricate.

This is a plain (shomin-geki) film ostensibly about plain (and not especially attractive) folks using a plain (impoverished) script with: plain (for the most part) acting; plain (often obscured or obscuring) sets; a plain (and often ""wandering-about"") film score; and plain (and very simple) camera work. To call this static, soporific, house-bound film a ""movie"" would be a stretch. Nothing much seems to move, and the attributes that render the motion picture a unique art form are pretty much ignored. A ""filmed pseudo stage play"" might be a more apt description. That said, the director seems to effectively reflect aspects of the contemporary trauma faced by a country whose long-standing (ancient) traditions are in the midst of serious migration in the aftermath of losing a disastrous war. Issues explored include: the ramifications of children no longer traditionally carrying for their aging parents (or wanting to); dealing with the loss of loved ones in the military service; facing rebellious (rather than obedient) children/grandchildren; living in cramped city apartments with dirty hallway; and the emergence of home-based businesses to just get by financially. The character actors who play the aging grandparents are principal weak spots. The actress playing the grandmother over wears a stoic mask; her face rarely reflects the different emotional lines she delivers. The actor who plays the grandfather is seriously miscast. He usually exhibits a goofy expression; lines reduced to continuously repeating ""pause words"" (like ""aahh"") and variations of SO DESU KA (""really?"", ""is that so?"", etc.) don't help matters (due to an impoverished script) . Often characters are seen looking out at things which are never shown to the audience (like in a stage play). The director seems to have a fetish for clothes (including under garments) drying on laundry lines. Some scenes show only laundry drying and many scenes have laundry lines in the foreground or the background (surprisingly, there are no scenes of clothes being washed!). Subtitles and video/audio restorations are fine. Bottom line: Unless you are interested in 20th Century Japanese cultural chaos, best to skip this one. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",

The drama centers on the relationships of parents and adult children in a way that is both touching and still relevant. How does one go about aging gracefully? And how do children respond to aging parents? Certainly the way it is handled here is leaning on the malicious and greedy side. There's a sense of yearning for this alien presence (the parents) to be gone and to not be dealt with. It seems like such a burden and a chore to care for elders. And yet there's the silver lining of a widowed daughter-in-law (daughter-in-law!) to save the trip from complete disaster. The ending of a mother passing lingers with you. Even then there's bickering over trifling possessions that the deceased had owned. I felt angry, but also know people in my life who hold no respect for even the dead. The movie ends with Shukishi meditating. I was left to ponder how he must feel knowing that he will be left all alone and also be treated in the same way.

The story slowly shifts to the parents reflecting upon their children and while being overly polite to the point of being evasive, they keep mentioning how they live much too far apart. Eventually, the parents decide to no longer burden their child and daughter in-law and travel home. Then children receive a somber telegram. Was there a reason the parents came to visit now? Aside from the honest drama, the camera perspective was noticeable as most of the film was shot from waist level which gives the characters a prominence and focus within the frame; as family is the focus of the film. I'd say the message this film is communicating is not to be so distant, emotionally, from your family. What should the relationship between parent and child be as they become adults?",

108,30 May 2015,ath_steph_3000,9, Ozu's poetic masterpiece,"""Tokyo Story"" is one of Ozu's poetic masterpieces. It is the story of a journey - of an older couple visiting their relatives in the bustling metropolis of Tokyo in the 1950s, the journey of the coming of age, and finally, the journey of life itself. With his touching images, Ozu manages to capture the spirit of a simple Japanese family's household but also the unsaid conflict and tension that can never really evacuate because of a cultural taboo. ""Tokyo Story"" is a wonderful narrative which contrasts tradition and modernity and the abrupt changes life brings. The perspective of the film shots is remarkable, as we can see the actors sitting or lying on the floor most of the time - this approach allows the viewer greater access to the more intimate spheres of a Japanese house while the dialogs reveal strong emotions. The film, despite its very modest storyline, will not leave anybody untouched because the impressions in it are very intense and unique.",

Several moving scenes and dialogues ensue in the typical Japanese social atmosphere of delicacy, politeness and courtesy very well depicted. Although there are not particularly dramatic scenes the atmosphere is realistic enough in psychological terms to allow us to be aware of the real feelings of the characters with great depth.

But when things start clicking, when I finally start to understand what's being conveyed and contrast here, I'm just hooked in on the modernized and Westernized city, the kind and forgiving, as well as the selfish, and the distances between characters, between family generations. I start to see my family in it, and like Kyoko, vow to never be like that. The use of non-Hollywood style and techniques is worth highlighting too, representing what's called the transcendental style. The non-melodramatic - characters always smiling, major plot points happening behind the camera - truly makes the style unique, not forcing but sharing emotions with the audience.

Ozu's well-publicised feelings regarding the responsibilities and duties of the family unit are never more elegantly or graphically portrayed than in this, one of the true masterpieces of post-war cinema.

Old parents from a distant province go for the first time to visit their grown-up children in Tokyo and Osaka, hoping to see them in ""full glory"" of adulthood achievements. They get disappointed by the ""modest"", busy lives of their off springs with little time and patience for old folks. Children are already fully separated from their parents emotionally and handle the visit like inescapable and rather annoying obligation to do something ""nice"". The only person who is really glad to see them is their daughter-in-law, caught in her own internal torturing fantasy of ""staying faithful"" to the long-dead husband. No bond is forever, neither parents/children nor husband/wife Any bond eventually gets torn down, it should be torn — this is the wisdom of life But who of us never kept holding to the relation, existing only in our heart? The karmic attachment to the past makes the parents and the young widow extremely vulnerable and causes them lots of emotional pain, which they endure quietly with great dignity, supporting each other with soul-felt love, care and understanding. This movie is made of the very fabric of human life. Absence of any judgment and genuine kindness give it an uplifting rather than depressing mood.

I recently saw the film again and became interested in the life of its director Yasujiro Ozu.  According to my brief research, Ozu is considered to be one of the greatest Japanese filmmaker of the 20th century.  During the 1930's, he fought as a front-line soldier of the Japanese Imperial Army in China. After a discharge from the Army, he was re-conscripted in the 1940's by the Japanese Army to make propaganda films.  He was a life-long bachelor who was apparently a hard-drinking but functioning alcoholic.  Toward the end of his life, he had to drink several pints of sake just to start the day.  Even though he was a hard working filmmaker, he was also a life-long party animal who partied really, really hard.  He could be rather bad-tempered.  When he was young, he got into trouble after punching a waiter at his studio's commissary.  In spite of his drinking and bad-temper, Ozu was worshipped by many Japanese actors and actresses.  He made many masterpieces, including ""Tokyo Story,"" `Equinox Flower,' and ""Floating Weeds,"" before his untimely death from cancer in 1963.  ",

Anyhow The film is so casual and something other filmakers dont included or think about to included because they dont make any different is in this film very much included and its those little things which make it so speciell.

In the sense of writing songs, it becomes indifferent, but this is the way everyone must go. With your own family, you have to assume your responsibilities. Kiko tried her best not to be old and not to become an indifferent adult, but she also admitted that she was inevitably changing like a big sister.
At the end, my father said: ""I knew that she should be treated well while she was alive."" The younger son also mentioned many times that ""the child wants to raise but not to kiss"" This is a very popular and difficult to understand in advance. Cherish the people before you.
In the clip where father and old friend chatted in the pub, they expressed anti-war thinking. Abomination of war, war makes people lose loved ones.
The feelings of being able to take a very ordinary family life are amazing. There are many tearful scenes. For example, grandma plays with grandchildren, and tears after Kiko turns off the lights.
In terms of running mirrors, there is only one way to use long shots in the entire movie, when the parents are on the street. The rest are fixed screen shots. In addition, the composition of the film is also very particular.

137,6 October 2020,milanis,2, Unbelievably slow and boring,"Even though I accept the differences in movie eras and/or directing ways, this movie is far overrated. Namely because not all dull things can be described as artistic.
The movie reflects on a rather universal topic - kids drifting apart from their parents, which become quite a nuisance to them. It's a story told many times, due to its universality, since everybody can find themselves in any side of the story - whether as kids or the parents. It's also nice to reflect upon yourself, comparing to the characters and the story line, drawing comparisons to your respective everyday lives and people.
However, this movie gives opportunity for neither of those.
The thing that struck me the most is lack of emotion throughout the movie, and even where reflected, it is so indescribably fake and hard-to-believe.
Of course, I don't mean to be disrespectful, especially acknowledging the difference in emotion expression in western and eastern Asian culture. However, this is not the case, especially comparing to other Japanese movies from this era.

That says a lot, and it means that the reviews that take Tokyo Story as damnation of the ungrateful devils in the younger generation or as damnation of a ""western society"" (as one reviewer fantasizes) are off base. ""Sho-ga-nai wane"" simply means ""that's the way it is"". My wife says it fairly often. ""Shikata-ganai"" seem to be more like ""life sux and then you die"". My wife doesn't say that and nobody says that in Tokyo Story. This movie is a dilemma, sort of like the dilemma discussed while they're drinking ... how it is tough to live with your kid but tough for them to be gone. This movie? As oka-san says about her kids ""certainly better than average"". And in Lake IMDBgone, average is about a 6.5, so I give this an 8. The problem? Tokyo Story is both literally and figuratively BLACK & WHITE. It is a simple movie. Even the dialogue is simple. How simple? I speak Japanese worse than kindergarten level, but I could understand most of what the older generation said. They talked slowly. They used simple grammar, polite forms, and simple words. So, I empathize with the commentator who panned it. Yeah, I also knew everything that would happen after 20 minutes of viewing. If I hadn't spent a lot of time in Japan and have Japanese in-laws, i.e. if I had little to no interest in Japan, I might feel similar and not even have watched the whole thing. (In this way, it is almost like Lost in Translation.) I mean, if you have little to no interest in Japan, it is neither very entertaining nor very revealing. Come on, you have to be pretty baka to not understand generational gaps and the damage done to family life by modern society. Well, duh! Having said all that, the message is well-done, it is universal, and who knows, maybe seeing it in a different time and place will add something for you even if all you know about Japan is Sony and Toyota.

Having to go through the immense lost of my grandfather (who was not only my grandfather, but someone who I can call my dad and my best friend) and knowing for a fact I will be missing him for the rest of my life until I die, I felt greatly disgusted by how a lot of the children in the film treated their parents. I come from a culture where we would NEVER put our parents or grandparents in an old person's home, and we would be more than willing to take care of the people who raised us just the same way they took care of us. If I have to make sacrifices in my job and my me time, then I would make no hesitation, because I LOVE, as well as RESPECT my grandparents/parents. Whatever differences we may have wouldn't even matter and in the end it never did. Not to trying to tell anyone how to live, but I think that showing some compassion and respect towards the people who did a lot for you shows a lot of character.

It is very touching if you're someone who is into empathy. It's about acting. Nothing moves, yet there is some surprising insight and candor and great quality with the dialogue. You're expecting to simply be a foreign witness to something exotic from a time past you cannot really understand (unless I guess you're a Japanese national from that era) but the parents provide surprising feedback and emotion, and this is beautiful nuanced top notch acting. Going into this a long time ago I though this was a feudal era piece so I was expecting the traditional clothing etc loll. It's all old but modern and those people got style. Sometimes you have to go very very far away (in my case) in order to find something very close. A movie which discusses age and family and makes you think about the quality of our interactions with people from different generations.

I've enjoyed silent films and ""art"" films, but this 2+ hour long examination of an elderly couple visiting the big city of Tokyo to visit many of their children and in-laws was painful to watch. I clicked on the ""spoiler alert"" box but there is really nothing that can be spoiled: the plot is so ""everyday life of ordinary people"" that there is no suspense at any point in the movie. The parents are very simple people and speak simply, often only affirming or negating a question by saying ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""is that right?"" So there is nothing resembling sterling dialogue. No, it is a character study of relationships among the family that carries on interminably.",
158,14 December 2011,ajoyce-222-935612,7, An elderly couple visit their children and grandchildren in Tokyo and find that they are not as welcome as they hoped.,"There are different reasons films become classics. Some because their imagery is burned into the memory's eye indelibly, others because the characters are unforgettable, still others because they blazed a new trail in the art form. Tokyo Story claims its distinction among lovers of world cinema largely due to its quietly revolutionary social material, as well as some indelible images: the view of the hill with the little figures of the grandmother and her grandson playing for example, like an animated version of one of those classic tiny bamboo sculptures encased in glass. To name only one beautifully framed shot. ",

163,18 April 2001,jacknchicken,9, Peaceful,"I started watching the movie, and it moved so slowly.  By the end of the movie, i was emotionally connected with the characters and i almost cried. I have never cried at a movie before (almost at Life is Beautiful, but thats another story).  You just have to get out of the MTV-rapid-cutting mindset, and live with a story told from a camera located on the ground.",
164,15 July 2020,Sadelovesmovies,10, Relationships do age...,"As a Westerner, this film can be hard to comprehend. It depicts a very different family dynamic than I am used to. However, that is what makes the film so engaging. It slowly peels off layers of civility and politeness to reveal a deep humanity and emotional vulnerability that resides within the family. This such a welcomed contrast to the overly dramatic and often one-note American films depicting the subject. Parent-child relationships do change with age, and it is often difficult to navigate. This film is heartbreaking in its honesty.",
165,7 November 2020,synsen-40334,9, The essence of life,"Slow and poignant, almost the mirror of a lifetime. A story greater than the movie, it had to be. We all know the story, no one is exempt from this situation. If not parents, it can also be another family member, or just a friend. The film makes you step back, and just look away for a minute. Years flow through your head, and you wonders what your life really means. Great film, great story.",
166,6 July 2000,abelina,10, Best movie for a classical movie beginner,"Through a typical Japanese family, it reminds us the priceless value of the traditional family.  The love of old couple showed on their slow conversation, I am deeply moved.  When one is sad, males in the traditional eastern society don't allow themselves to cry out, the only thing he can do is to drink a lot with old friends.  How sad it is!  Parents and grandparents are always treat the grandson very well, and most of the time they become spoiled children.  After children grown up, it seems that only the death can definitely bring everyone home.  This movie gives us a chance to review the value of our own.  Wonderful!",
167,20 December 2015,invertedforest-70474,9, Nostalgia,"I cannot think that this film is about Japanese but foreigners, because all characters are bit different from current people in Japan although this film was made in the old days. For example, such a big family is decreasing in a big city and family relationship changed significantly from those years. However, the theme which is treated in this film is not out of the date. I think that it is a universal theme for every person. In spite of this film doesn't have any action scene, but tranquil scenes and quiet conversations attracted me. Its atmosphere makes me feel good, because it reminds me nostalgic things although I didn't experience.",

169,18 March 2006,raaesquire,10, This is Japanese Cinema.,"even seven samurai is getting too commercial, because it is so western. while i love the seven samurai, there is another aspect to Japanese cinema besides kurosawa. that other half includes yasujiro ozu, who is probably one of the most unconventional filmmakers on this side of the Atlantic. there is no side swipes nor fast paced editing. instead, ozu pulls the camera back, has very little movement, and we just observe what is going on. the dialogue in tokyo monogatari may seem a little pretentious with a stationery camera, but this, in a sense, is sort of capturing life as it is. i'd say in the final scenes of the film where the dialogue is its best, for it is here where we see the power of this simple story. what was very interesting for this new comer to ozu is how he actually kills off one of the main characters throughout the plot, and i think it is his usage of dialogue and editing that has this death of this main character impact me more than the death of - oh, let's say obi wan kenobi in star wars. that is because he comes back in spirit. star wars is fantasy, while tokyo monogatari is not. i want to show this film to my parents, as a message for them to respect their elders that they take care of and complain about. but, they'll probably tell me i'm either ungrateful or that the movie was boring. but, viewers such as the ones that share the same feelings about tokyo monogatari as i know better. this is an excellent film, and i am grateful to have seen it.",
170,31 January 2011,ChorusGirl,10, Early Reality TV,"Quite unlike any other film...with a camera so passive it almost feels like we are eavesdropping into the lives of this family. As in McCarey's similar MAKE WAY FOR TOMORROW, there are no obvious villains here...though the adult children may be selfish, many viewers will be able to sympathize with them. While parents fear dying alone, children fear having the burden of aging parents. TOKYO STORY never lets you forget this.",
171,22 July 2006,shart-15,10, How good can a film get?,"Perhaps the finest film ever made. Technically it is a breathtaking piece, showing Ozu's static, tatami-hight camera work and exploiting his unique 360º space. By this I mean that instead of the usual Hollywood/Western 180º Ozu utilizes a spherical space. When the old mother tells her widowed daughter-in-law how much she enjoys her visit the daughter-in-law is initially screen right. Noriko massages Tomi's shoulders and then she stands to cross the room. In a typical Western film this would be a cut on action, the action 'disguising' the cut. Ozu cuts on her motion too but at the same time shifts the camera across the 180º line. Thus, when the cut on Noriko's motion is completed she is now screen left.",

However, their children were very hard, and they are unkind to their parents. This movie focuses on family ties and life and death. This movie draws a reality of family in Japan. Almost all children leave their home and live their respective lives. Of course, I think I will be one of them. It is often forgot that parents are always worried about children, and we also have to consider our children. This movie reminds us important things which we tend to forgot. This movie draws a family from the point of view of parents, so we are made notice that we have to be dutiful to our parents. After watching this movie, I consider the importance of family, and I think I want to tell my parents thanks. I want many people watch this movie.",

185,13 August 2020,benjamin-wasneeplus,9," Subtle, dignified and intense","There is a certain aura around Ozu movies that tends to scare away more casual viewers. They are movies about life, about ordinary folks people often say. One might hear that and think it's a bore fest meant for only the more ardent art film snobs. But that would be a mistake. Tokyo Story is not boring. Yes, it takes a while to get going, but if you're afraid of some kind of Andy Warhol experimental visual poetry, then it's time to put those fears to rest.",
