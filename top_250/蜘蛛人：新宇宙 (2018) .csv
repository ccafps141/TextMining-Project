0,26 March 2019,planktonrules,10, Fantastic...but possibly overwhelming.,"""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is a fantastic film but might be a bit overwhelming for some viewers. It's filled with blaring hip-hop music and the animation is beyond splashy...it's competely intense! Now these are NOT criticisms...more a warning if you hate these sorts of things or if you or someone you loves has challenges, such as Autism....as the film might really be overwhelming. Still, I'm nearly 55 and loved the picture...and I think most will if they have an open mind and want something different. That DOES strongly apply to me, as I've gotten sick of superhero movies because there have been so many recently and there's a certain sameness about them...but not this Spider-Man film!",/
1,19 November 2019,Hitchcoc,10, So Much More Than I Expected!,"So many have commented, so I will be brief. From an intriguing plot to wonderful characterizations using drop dead animation, this film works. About ten minutes into it it thought, ""This is just a kind of hip hop version of Spiderman."" But the main character is suddenly thrust into a world which he must learn quickly to manage. The canon takes a turn here toward incredible creativity. I avoid mainstream animation, but this has restored my faith.",r
2,21 December 2018,matthewssilverhammer,8, How on God's green Earth did this work so well???,"The worlds of superhero movies and superhero comics are not as similar as they seem on the surface. Currently, film studios are all about the ""extended universe"", seeing how many different titles and characters they can shove into one franchise (Avengers, X-Men, Justice League), making for an easy way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of their lesser known properties. Comics have this as well, of course. However, they also have something modern movies haven't really tapped into yet: story one-offs, a chance for a storyteller to create a unique tale and not be constrained by the implications on or from the larger universe. Spider-Verse gets to do just that, while playfully taking on the fun (if convoluted) absurdity of extended superhero universes.
Listen, I hear you. ""How could we possibly need another Spider-Man movie?"" Spider-Verse understands that question and has a take on it. Yes, Peter Parker is here. In fact, there are two Peter Parkers. There's also a Spider-Woman, a Noir Spider-Man, an anime Spider-Girl/Robot, and a Spider-Pig. At the center though is Miles Morales, an Afro-Hispanic Brooklyn teen who must help these other Spider-People get back to their own planes of existence. He fights with his cop dad, he adores his shady uncle, hates being simply the smartest kid in the room, and just wants to do something that matters. Being Spider-Man wasn't his idea, but hey, when a radioactive spider gives you powers, what choice do you have?
Look, I don't have any sort of hot take on this movie. It looks great, the humor pops with surprises, the voice casting is beyond perfect. It's simply a stylishly exciting and refreshingly unique take on the superhero genre, and sometimes that's more than enough.",e
3,26 December 2018,BandSAboutMovies,10, The best comic book movie I've ever seen,"The thing I hate about superhero movies is the origin story. After a multitude of Spider-Man stories, do we really need another retelling of his origin? That's the first - of many - things that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse does right. Much like how Grant Morrison retold Superman's beginnings in one page in All-Star Superman, this movie tells you everything you need to know within one minute and goes right into the action. It expects you to know the expected, but then once it makes you feel comfortable, it tears the rug out from under you.",v

This film lives up to the hype and honestly surpassed my expectations. The only reason I think there are some negative reviews is because you can never please everyone. However, for the vast majority of viewers, I believe you'll find this film to be great. Highly recommend seeing it in theaters just for the amazing animation style.",i

6,20 December 2018,soulsplosion,10, the most visually stunning film I've ever seen,"There's hardly anything I would improve about this film. The visuals, concepts, soundtrack, characters, pace, humor and animation are all some of the best I've ever seen in any film; I was worried the hype would ruin it for me, as it always does, but not even the group of kids in the theater who wouldn't stop loudly talking could ruin it for me. It is visually engaging and beautiful in every scene, not to mention with an incredibly unique art style, and is honestly something other animated movies should have to look up to for a long time. The only real issue I can think of is the flashing lights, which really alienates any epileptic audience, but even then it's done so in a beautiful and artful way.",w
7,14 December 2018,Cizzurp215,10, A Spidey Movie That Works In Multiple Dimensions,Visually stunning. Great storyline. Great cast. Amazing soundtrack. Tear jerking cameo. Pop culture post credit scene of the decade. Thank you Marvel and Sony for making a Spidey movie everyone can love.,/

From the very beginning, Spider-Man: Into the Spicer-Verse is very energetic and captures your attention. This animated film has impressive visuals. The music creates a fantastic rhythm. And you just want to watch more.",w
10,15 December 2018,vancewinstead,10, Giving Infinity war a run for it's money,"This movie was absolutely incredible. From the animation, to the storytelling, to the characters this movie is completely one of a kind. It is easily the best looking animated movie of the year (no surprise there), but what really caught me off guard was the story they were able to tell in such a short amount of time. Each character has their own distinct personality and is given their own separate characterization without making the movie feel bloated. I knew I would end up liking this movie, but this movie has completely exceeded my expectations. If you enjoy superheros or animation you should 100% definitely watch it in a theater.",5
11,4 January 2019,FairlyAnonymous,7," Visually innovative, but has a lack of focus and is overstuffed.",As much as I enjoy this movie (and as an animator/storyartist I love the visuals!) I have to honest and say it is a bit of an unfocused mess. The reason why you should see this movie is because it is the first in what will hopefully be a trend of innovative and creative animated movies that aren't just looking over the shoulders of what Disney and Pixar are doing. This movie is its own creature and I think it deserves to be seen just for the visuals and the opportunity to hopefully support this trend...,1
12,21 December 2018,mahmus,10, The Best Spider-Man movie ever!,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is one of the most beautiful animated movies I've seen and possibly the best looking superhero movie of all time; with its bright neon colors combined with its comic book asthetic, it creates a world unlike anything I've seen since the LEGO Movie.
The characters are all great. Miles Morales is a fantastic protagonist; understandably scared at the prospect of being Spider-Man, but excited to learn. His relationship with his father and Peter Parker are some of the most emotiinal scenes in the movie. Gwen Stacy is also a great supporting character, as are thr rest of the spider people.
The villains are fun and the action is jaw dropping.
It's also tear jerking tribute to Stan Lee.
This is the best Spider-Man movie by far.",1
13,15 December 2018,benribble,10, This movie is not over hyped!,"Going into this I had high hopes but, was afraid It might not be as good as the hype says But, damn... This movie is underhyped. I loved every second of it. The animation was gorgeous, the characters were so fun and the soundtrack, flawless. The twists, you never see coming and don't even get me started on how beautiful the end fight scene was. This film is the best animated film of 2018 and in my opinion, the best film of 2018 definitely worth seeing!",4

Now, all the Spideys must team up to put an end to a danger, that could alter reality in terrible ways.",8
15,13 March 2019,Top_Dawg_Critic,7, A little overrated but still good.,"Didn't find the graphics that appealing and the story was ok, but nothing spectacular. I'm guessing anyone into anime or young kids would've enjoyed this more than teens and older viewers. 7/10 from me",6
16,15 December 2018,chriscarlisle25,10, Out of This Dimension Good! 100/10 off the Charts!,"I knew that this movie would be good from the first moment I heard about it last year, and it did not disappoint me one bit. It met all of my expectations, and then went above and beyond them. The animation is a blend of CGI, stop animation, pop/comic book art and realism. The vibrant colors pop out at you, and the action sequences really enthrall. A very captivating and beautiful piece of art is this movie, and the writing choices leave nothing to be desired. The story is that of the traditional starting superhero with a bunch of twists thrown in. The movie itself actually follows past comics for the most part, with some minor changes here and there. A true Spider-Man, or comic book fan in general, will not have anything to criticize in this movie. Everything that fans want to see out of Spidey(s) is in this movie. There are multiple different variations of Spider-Man in the film, and all of them have their special moments to shine. The end credit scene just rockets this movie up past my already positive expectations, and it gets a 10/10 from me! The movie can be enjoyed by both young and old alike, and trust me, it will blow your mind! Best animated film of 2018, and one of the best superhero movies ever made. It deserves any and all awards and kudos it will surely garner.",5

21,11 December 2018,kjproulx,10, Possibly the Best Spider-Man Feature Film Ever Made,"Growing up, I grew an appreciation for the character of Spider-Man that I've never been able to develop for any other comic book character. It was Sam Raimi's original live-action trilogy that hooked me and had me scrounging for more. Watching countless episodes of every cartoon iteration, and even starting to read a few of the comics, I found myself becoming a huge fan of this generational icon. Once Spider-Man 3 hit theatres, the character had lost all hope on the big screen, until Andrew Garfield took the role from Tobey Maguire, which didn't last too long, and also crashed and burned. Finally, he found his footing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, played by Tom Holland, but none of that matters when watching Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Not only is this the best that this character has been in a while, but I believe there's a real argument to made that this is possibly the greatest feature-length film based on this character, period.",f
22,2 January 2019,classicsoncall,7," ""What would I do if I were me?""","Uh-oh, I feel a 'here I go again' coming. As I write this, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is ranked #29 on IMDb's list of Top 250 movies of all time, right there in between ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Léon: The Professional"". Among the eighty plus comic-book based super-hero movies I've seen and reviewed, it comes in at #2, right behind ""The Dark Knight"", which means viewers give it a higher rating than ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", if any of you Marvel fans care about that. I don't know, I just think there's just something askew about that, instinctively telling me that in this case, it's not the quality of the movie that places it so high in the rankings, but the overall popularity and buzz that attaches itself to the film. But enough of that.",_

I was waiting for something beyond my expectation but when it became weirder it definitely became a lot weirder. If you have seen episodes of The Flash, this film's story feels like meh. Apart from the dialogues, it's definitely bad writing. The main character is completely clueless about being spider-man but when the writers need him to use his skills, voila!, he knows it all, like the back of his hand.",t
25,17 December 2018,jackgdemoss,9, The BEST depection of Spider-Man yet!,"This film was phenomenal for so many reasons. First and most importantly, it was the most visually impressive film I have seen to this day. The animation style alone had such a mystical and wonderous quality to it. The animators didn't stop there, however. They added so many little fun details that made me feel like I was watching some sort of blend between comic and movie. In addition to the gorgeous visual nature of Spider-Man, I was impressed by both the humor and the meta references. The reference to the cringey Spider-Man 3 scene and the post-credits meme reference were my personal favorites. There were tons of little details that I am sure I never truly appreciated because I have never been a consumer of comic books, but I have to imagine that this film is even more special to Marvel comic fans. The only gripe that I have with Spider-Man is that it failed to keep my attention in act 3. It was longer than it should have been, and it would have benefited greatly by cutting down 10 minutes. With that being said, this is the best movie I have seen in a few months and I hope that my review reaches someone who was not going to see it and urges them to reconsider.",t

27,18 December 2018,TheMovieDoctorful,10, So Much More Than I Could Have Hoped,"I've waited 4 years to love Spider-Man this much. From comics to movies to video games, the last Spider-Man related story that I truly loved was the divisive Marc Webb movie, The Amazing Spider-Man 2. However, 2018 has really turned things around for my favorite Marvel superhero; from his groundbreaking video game for the PS4 to the brilliant Nick Spencer taking the reigns from the incompetent Dan Slott in the comics. Hell, even the MCU's depiction of Spider-Man (Which I despised in both Civil War and Homecoming) was surprisingly enjoyable in Infinity War, despite my thoughts on the rest of the film. The resurgence in quality Spider-Man stories continues with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse; perhaps the best superhero film since 2004's Spider-Man 2.",u
28,10 January 2019,tavm,10, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse will hopefully blow your mind as it did mine and a couple of friends of mine!,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and his adult nephew. We all were enthralled by the tale of the various Spider-Heroes depicted in this film especially the main one of Miles Morales. Some of the backgrounds looked like what a 3-D movie would look like without wearing the glasses which confused me to think I needed them but then the front scenes were clear so I then knew I didn't. Great visuals and story. Also, nice extended cameo by co-creator Stan Lee and touching since this was released after his passing. Nice of the credits sequence to also dedicate the movie in memory of him and other co-creator Steve Ditko. So that's a very high recommendation of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.",r
29,13 December 2018,Zephrey,10," Anyone can wear the mask, but no one can rock it like Miles Morales","I'm blown away, this movie is absolutely beautiful. The animation is stunning, the soundtrack is amazing and the dialogue and storyline is so heart-warming.
The characters are memorable, they all bring their own emotions rubbing off on the audience, and the humor is right on, its daring and hilarious and doesn't seem forced like you might see in some of the MCU films.
There's been 7 Spider-Man films in the last 16 years and this might be the best one yet, its pays its respect to the past films while driven on its own storyline adventure, being such a known character the movies still comes out as original.
The cinematography and animation are gorgeous, definitely oscar worthy. I'd say this is one of the best superhero origins movies ever made. Then there's the numerous amount of easter eggs, be on the lookout for those.
I can't say the movies underrated cause its be treated just as it should be, but if there's one thing that its underrated its the soundtrack, the funny thing is the soundtrack is the exact type of music Miles Morales would listen to, so I guess you could say there's a touch of realism.
In the end all I can see is go see this movie for yourselves, the visual experience is amazing, its touching and serious, funny and witty, brings more emotion than some of the superhero movies you'll see today and best of all if your sick of superhero movies this is a complete different and fresh start of the genre. (Don't forget to wait till the end of the credits)",v
30,15 December 2018,jeannefrancoise,10, What a fascinating graphic to win Golden Globe very soon,"Dear Marvel fans, since I knew Spider Gwen is dubbed by my idol Hailee Steinfeld, I really wanted to watch this Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse movie. Then happily I did watch it and my review is just short: This movie is a fascinating graphic that please your eyes! Take a very big applause for artistic department and all team that make the idea of parallel universe could be combined with the original story of Spiderman. The identity, friendship, battles, family relations of Peter Parker became clear enough for the whole story of Spiderman series itself. How we ever knew about him, what is going on in his world, and when Spiderman transform himself to be a hero, is explained more here, and with the special appearances of Kingpin and his villain team, the director could lead the plots into the fun way for everybody. This is not just ordinary cartoon, but the highly qualified design graphic with the exact scenes, special effects, and bubble conversation like a moving comic-book. Every details in this animation is clearly edited by professional film-makers with any mistakes, nor any flaws. Even for Spiderman fans, this movie is so fresh to be watched and stays in his original starting point. No matter how many Spiderman movies could ever be made, this Spiderverse perhaps the first sci-fi animation I've ever watched and what a fascinating graphic to win Golden Globe very soon. And yes, I listen carefully of what Spider Gwen said because it is dubbed by my idol, Hailee Steinfeld, who will win many awards ahead. Thank you producer, director, casts, and crew to deliver this amazing movie to us.",

32,13 December 2018,eashanvad,10, Best animated film of 2018,"I had high expectations for this movie and it didn't fail to meet them, this film has great animation, great humour, emotion, and heart. It has pretty much everything people would want for an animated movie.",
33,7 December 2018,Thekeybaldemasterrises,10, Stop with the race agenda @ IMDB users,"Edit: I see a lot of people have already thumbed down this review because it sounds like people are playing the race card with this movie. ""Peter Parker is the only Spider-Man!!"" Look watch the movie for yourself, or don't see it at all. If you're really that bothered by a black Spider-Man in this movie then why are you here reading reviews? You still have the Rami films and heck you still have the Garfield films if that's what floats your boat. If you really care about good storytelling and good animation then hear me out.
Into the Spider-Verse is the hour of redemption for Sony's animation studio. I haven't been particularly happy with their recent films ranging from endless Hotel Transylvania sequels, constant remakes of the Smurfs, and of course the god awful Emoji Movie. I kept asking myself, when Sony? When will you actually use your creative talents and give us something worth our time? And folks, this is it. This is their baby. Into the Spider-Verse is not only one of the best animated films of the year, it's one of the best Spider-Man films period. I was skeptical at first too, the high ratings, the complex story, the studio, but thankfully the reviews were right on this. What this movie does so well is how it constantly engages its audience through visual storytelling. It reflects the same methods Stan Lee/Steve Ditko used when they wrote their comic stories all those years ago. You can tell the filmmakers did their homework and really captured the comic book esthetic to a whole other level. It's colorful, it's full of amazing textures, and the action is just amazing to watch. Now if the movie solely relied on this I probably would've given it a lower rating but thankfully they wrote a nice story here. We get to finally see Miles Morales come to life and while I didn't think he had the most interesting personality compared to say Peter Parker, he worked as a vessel for the audience. We got to see his Spider-Man journey in a very unique and interesting way that feels nostalgic but fresh at the same time. I do have to add that I didn't quite feel the emotional weight in this film with Miles' character arc like I did in Tobey's Spider-Man 2, but it was still emotionally satisfying for this film on its own when you don't compare it to previous films. In the end, this was still my favorite Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2. It's funny, fun, and full of heart. I would be ok with Sony owning the license to Spider-Man if they kept making movies with this animation style but still carry some depth and passion in the storytelling. Because this movie honored the most endearing thing about Spider-Man's story, and it's that anyone can wear the mask. It's that universal trait that Steve Ditko and Stan Lee created all those years ago that make this character so mythological and so palpable. And this has one of Stan's best cameos yet I promise you that. If you're a Spidey fan, or just a comic fan, or even just a fan of animated films. YESSS GO SEE IT. This is my favorite animated film of the year, if not in years, and might potentially creep into my top 10 films of the year. PLEASE GO SUPPORT THIS. 9/10.",
34,19 December 2018,ninjaboyballer,10, THE spider man movie,"I gotta day I thought this movie was going to suck because of that awful emoji movie by Sony. Boy was I wrong. This probably my favorite spider man movie. It as great characters, great comic book action, great emotional moments, great animation. I also liked in some particular scenes they were down for using violence. In the movie a character gets crushed and another one gets shot. Although it didn't actually show any blood or anything, it's still a bit over the top for a PG movie. But I'm glad they had the balls to do that. It also feels like your watching an actual comic book. Like they have those sound effects like when spider man thwips his webs and when characters punch and kick each other and explosions go off. It feels like a panel of a comic come to life. I also like how they make peter and Gwen's backstories hilariously sad. This is actually a pretty funny movie. I was suprised that this movie was funny. I also like they have journeys for the two main characters that are wrapped up by the end of the film. This film also shows how the character of spider man is so inspirational and important. How he matters not just to the marvel universe but how he relates to people who read his stories. And the post credits scene is probably my favorite of this year. Wait till the end to see it. I pretty much loved everything about this movie except probably Kingpin. He was underdeveloped a lot and I wish he was given more to do. Overall though, Spider man into the spider verse is a blast of a film and I am going to give it a 9.7/10",

Attempts to be two things at once, a Spider Man film and a sort of parody of a Spider Man film. It does have heart, and never goes to far into silliness.

40,6 April 2019,andrewroy-04316,6," For such an inventive premise and excellent animation, questionable plot choices are made and the themes and arc are surprisingly formulaic","I think this one is mostly ""on me"", as someone who never read comic books growing up and enjoys the ideas that movies leave me with, not the visual experience as much. Spider-Verse is undeniably creative and unique, particularly in its animation, which I think is the best I've ever seen, and the premise is a self-aware and original breath of fresh air in the superhero genre. The voice acting is good, and the comedy is pretty good (though I found the jokes revolving around Miles being young and being goofy in learning his powers to be trite and overplayed). While I was ready to love it, many plot points left me scratching my head and there was no sense of any real stakes. Among the frustrating plot points to me were the absurdity of the 3 new spider people, especially Porky (why? How does that make any sense?); the uncle coincidentally being the person working for Kingpin and tasked with chasing down Spider-Man; Kingpin's backstory scene, where we are following Miles escaping and out of nowhere cut to a memory of Kingpin's family dying after having no background on him at all, just felt very out of place and poorly edited; and other minor points. The story was quite predictable and followed a rote story arc, which contributed significantly to the sense that the outcome was never in doubt, keeping my emotional investment and engagement low throughout. In classic deus ex machina form, Miles struggled and gradually is improving in using his powers, and then right after his dad talks to him he magically has complete control and can win all the fights, is a beast out of nowhere? It had done such a good job of showing his struggles in being valued and succeeding in his tasks, so the flipped switch of him effortlessly and suddenly being powerful was a disservice to the rest of the movie. Thematically, it didn't feel like anything unique, as a standard coming of age story and with a message that anyone can be a superhero. It pays obvious and honest homage to the comic book form, more genuinely adapting the style than any movie I've seen before. It did many things really well, but the various plot point frustrations and the lack of emotional investment due to the lack of stakes made it a forgettable, if pleasant, movie experience for me. I certainly recommend it to others, as at minimum you'll get a fun, amusing and visually gorgeous movie and if you like the comic book style, it could be an all time great.",
41,23 December 2018,cardsrock,9, One of the best superhero stories to hit the screen,"I've long thought that Spider-Man 2 was the gold standard for Spider-Man movies. I think it's safe to say that Into the Spider-Verse gives it a run for its money. Everything about this film, the beautiful animation, voice-acting, character development, and music are top notch. You can tell that the people behind this movie actually care about Spider-Man and care about their craft. From hilarious references to touching storytelling, this movie is just a joy to watch. It's such a unique addition to the genre and indicates that as long as talented people are involved in making these films, the superhero genre will continue to reinvent itself.",

44,11 January 2019,alansabljakovic-39044,7, Overrated and overhyped,Well this will hurt but I don't know why is this rated so high when it's pretty average story with a big help from animation part.

It has a completely fresh and different style compared to any other comic book movie I've watched, now I don't just think this is the best animated movie ever, I think it's the best Spider Man movie ever, the best superhero movie ever and one of the best movies ever, which is a massive accomplishment. Considering the Sony movie that came before it was The Emoji Movie, most people were skeptical, but leaving that theatre, I have no doubt in my mind people were blown away! The idea of a multiverse is sick, but it's even sicker when it is executed like it was in Into the Spider Verse, it is often considered the best Spider Man movie of all time, even by Raimi trilogy fans (such as myself) and it definitely deserves that title. It balances seriousness and comedy without falling down, and that ""What's up Danger?"" scene is magnificent and one of the best scenes in cinema history!",

The screenplay is sharp, funny and emotionally resonant. Miles is a great character. Not a mere clone of Peter Parker but a person in his own right with unique foibles and desires. The screenplay does a lot to demonstrate the particulars of representation lead to different tonalities. It manages to make a really obvious twist hidden in the process of doing that as well. The story is great.",

With Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Sony not only took a huge risk with the animation style, it's lead character, and bold story choices, but it's actually a very good film in its own right. Blending a heartfelt story, well-timed humor, and a bold animation style, Spider-Verse is the best Spider-Man film to date, and one that should garner all sorts of accolades. If it wasn't for an ending that gets bloated with hectic animation, it could flirt with some of my favorite animated movies of all time list.

The movie also features Peter Parker as a side character to make room for a new Spider-Man and I love this part of the story and how it introduces so many characters but doesn't feel crowded. The animation is also very beautiful, fluid and unique you'll never be bored. It's also very funny for kids of all ages to enjoy.

66,21 December 2018,oscaralbert,9, Since they conclude with Quantum Explosions . . .,". . . and especially because they each opened in American theaters on December 14, 2018, viewers have naturally wondered whether MORTAL ENGINES and SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE tell the same story. The quick answer to this question is a simple ""Yes."" Let's examine some of the areas of congruence . The makers of MORTAL ENGINES and SPIDER-VERSE strive mightily to make their characters more ""diverse"" than a United Nations picnic. This is quite ironic, because these flicks emanate from New Zealand and Japan, two of the LEAST diverse, most homogenous places on Earth, with immigration policies that make the USA's current White House Occupant seem like a spiritual brother to the Statue of Liberty by way of comparison. However, SPIDER-VERSE deserves a higher satisfaction rating than MORTAL ENGINES because it celebrates a hallowed past (even after ALL of its end credits have rolled), while the latter flick runs out of gas desperately seeking to set up sequels which will rival HEAVEN'S GATE II, HOWARD THE DUCK QUACKS AGAIN, and ANOTHER ISHTAR when it comes to audience demand.",

78,19 December 2018,BenWollmuth,10, The Spider-Man Movie Sony Needed,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an ambitious film. Sony's last few attempts with the character of Spider-Man have been underwhelming to say the least. I haven't seen a good Sony owned Spider-Man movie since 2004's Spider-Man 2. Luckily, Spider-Man: Homecoming turned out to be a pretty good film, but that was mainly Disney and Marvel Studios, so I still had low expectations. However, I am happy to say that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an awesome Spider-Man film, and an amazing film overall.
Instead of following Peter Parker like every other Spider-Man film out there, this film instead tells the story of Miles Morales and how he handles being Spider-Man. This is a bit different, however, because instead of skipping the learning and the suit making, we see his struggles firsthand. Miles makes a promise to his world's original Spider-Man that he would put a stop to Kingpin, but he has no idea how to control his powers, so he has a hard time.
Luckily, Kingpin's fancy collider machine happens to bring in some other Spider-Man, as well, so that Miles can get the help that he needs. The best part about this film is the way the characters are handled. The writers understand the character of Spider-Man, no matter what dimension he/she is from. They all have different personalities and art styles that make them stand out from each other. They did such a great job that I now want to see spin-off films for all of the Spider-Men in this movie.
Into the Spider-Verse is a lighthearted film, and is able to mix seriousness with comedy for the perfect effect. From the comedy aspect, the film, as I said before, understands Spider-Man. He is a funny character and knows how to stay calm in any situation. He cracks goofy jokes and says witty one-liners. With this movie, the different personalities of the different Spider-Men mixing together brings the comedy. On the other hand, the serious family issues bring some conflict to different characters, but in order to keep this spoiler free, I will not go in depth.
There is one issue I have with the film, but it isn't too big. Okay, the character is too big, but the issue is not. Kingpin, I feel, needed more characterization in order for me to think of him as a good villain. We learned some things about his family, but that was really it. He was a just a large man who wanted to conduct an evil plot. I can look past this, however, because the movie wasn't really focused on Kingpin. It was more focused on the Spider-Men, and most importantly, Miles Morales. Since this was done so well, I can forgive the film the Kingpin issue.
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was a film that was much needed on Sony's part, because it shows that they still have good things they can do with the character. Animation, I feel, is the best format for Spider-Man, but that might be because I grew up watching the Spider-Man animated series. Overall, this is an awesome film, and definitely deserves a watch. If you are a Spider-Man fan, I believe you will truly adore this movie as much as I did. If you are a heavy critic who doesn't know much about the character of Spider-Man, I think you will enjoy this movie too. If you just like movies in general, go out and see this movie. It's worth it.",
79,19 December 2018,Phil_M_A_Kerr,9, Spidey-sense very common in this radioactive spin on the web-slinger,"Using misaligned colour templates, like 3D without the glasses, for portions of the screen that were out of focus was a bold step. Bring them together and our eye is drawn to that now sharp part of the screen whilst everything else goes out of focus, or rather misaligned. What a different way to direct the audiences' eyes. Maybe a subliminal nod to the existence of parallel realities.
Like all good PG animations, the creators build a bit more depth into the narrative which makes the film a coming-of-age tale, leading the young viewers into the world beyond. Despair and faith, loss and hope, and all those adulty type themes are threaded through this three-dimensional ... no, MULTI-dimensional tale.
It is a silky-smooth incorporation of comic book panels, colours, and shading into a big screen motion picture.
The city slicker wit had me laughing out loud aplenty although it is occasionally too clever for this semi-rural simpleton.
This was a Tuesday night 9:30pm session with about a dozen adults and no kids so it was probably wasted somewhat without its target audience. Nevertheless, it is good to see the PG-rated teen animated epic is in capable hands.
When I was a lad we had epics like Watership Down, the Mouse Trap to enthrall is over the Festive period. I hope Into The Spiderverse delivers just as well to the current generation.",

The animation style, the universe(s), the voice acting, the story telling, everything is amazing. I feel bad for the other animated films this year, because Into the Spider-Verse blows them all out of the water. It's hard to believe this is the same animation studio that made the smash hit The Emoji Movie. Spider-Man: Homecoming is still my favorite from the hero, but this one is not far behind. My only, tiny complaint is that the villains weren't very fleshed out, but with the multiple Spider men and women needing adequate backgrounds and screen time, I can easily look past it. This is a superhero movie for the typical fans or the oblivious viewer, creating the always beautiful message that anyone can wear the mask. We're all a lit bit Spider-Man.",

86,16 December 2018,piggulu,6, Split Personality,"Overall, I found the whole thing underwhelming. While the animation and comic book style is excellent, the movie suffers from a monumental case of identity. Excluding the parallel universe concept, it initially presents itself as grounded/realistic. Average kid just wanting to be a kid, etc. But then it heaps on unspectacular one-liners/physical gags reminiscent of old cartoons (Kingpin's design and Peter Porker) I felt like I was watching a Dreamworks animation film, and although I easily classify myself as ""young at heart"" and am always a fan of classic Looney Toons(Tunes?) I didn't find much particularly funny here. Which leads to the question: who is the main audience, young/older adults or primarily kids? It doesn't really play strength to either. Is the movie an ensemble film? Not really, Miles is so much the main focus that the rest of the could've been left out entirely or just appeared at the end and it probably would've made a tighter film. None of them get to personally shine or have a memorable moment. One can argue that's part of the charm of ""Anyone can wear the mask"" but I disagree.",

I was looking forward to this movie for two reasons: a great voice cast and the whimsy of multiple Spider Man/characters from varying dimensions. But instead of building interesting characters (heroes and villians) I was presented with a number of long, chaotic action sequences robbed of dramatic (or comedic) tension by the lack of well articulated characters and interpersonal dynamics. There was also a production anomaly that was puzzling - there were times when the animation was blurry as if drawn for 3D (there was a 3D version, but that wasn't the one I was viewing), so, I hastily put on my 3D glasses, which I happened to have at hand, and it was still 2D, just blurry ... odd(?).

The ones helmed by Sam Raimi were particularly impressive, as those films focused on the idea of the boy beneath the mask, Peter Parker.

Whether they be the right blend of goofiness and emotional drama with Sam Raimi's trilogy, or the embarrassingly lackluster Amazing Spider-Man series, the web slinging hero has been through as many duds as successes. However, there has never really been an animated feature with this hero or any incarnations....until now.

This is a fresh take on Marvel that we have not really seen before when it comes to a PG cartoon. This was unique and stylish and very comicy and was incredible! The Spider group made the film for me! Liev Schreiber was GREAT as Wilson Fisk! This is the first film with Nicolas Cage where I actually dug him! Everything else I have seen him in is either overrated or just ok, but I really enjoyed his role in this and hope this makes for a comeback in his career, considering for years he has been in some STRANGE movies but he worked well in this! Noir Spiderman is actually a really neat take on Spiderman! This film does things in such unique style! I mean, Peter Porker and an anime Spider character! Holy cow! This film pulls you in and doesn't let go till the credits! The story is wonderful and very personal, the characters are wonderful, the artsy style and animation is beautiful, the voice acting is legit! Go see this! It is about time Sony gets their act together and make good Marvel movies! Having an entire group sort of like the Avengers, consisting on incredibly unique Spider characters, CREATIVITY IS STILL OUT THERE! I really hope to see more of this group in the future, because they are a great team! I wish I could view this as a masterpiece but for some reason I do not. It is awfully close to it though!",

113,17 December 2018,jg_1977,10," No, it's not over-hyped, it is that good.","Wow. That's the only word that I was able to articulate after being blown away by Spider-Verse. Normally I write my reviews as soon after seeing the movie as possible, however this time, I needed to give myself a few days to make sure I wasn't just riding the high that the movie leaves you on, and that it actually was as well-made as I thought. A few days later and my thoughts haven't changed. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is not only the best animated movie of the year, it's also the best superhero movie of the year (and this is coming from someone who loved both Black Panther and Infinity War), and simply one of the best movies of the year period (not to mention the best Spider Man movie of all time). This film succeeds in every conceivable way: it's got well-written, compelling characters that are brought to life by superlative acting; the visuals are stunning and create the most immersive theater experience of the year; the action is thrilling and never gets repetitive; the story manages to be both completely groundbreaking while also paying homage to the Spider Man story we know and love; and best of all, the comedy is absolutely spot on, every single joke lands without feeling cheap or getting old. As good as this movie is across the board, I suspect it all stemmed from an impressively written screenplay. Not surprisingly, Phil Lord (and an uncredited Chris Miller), truly understands what people enjoy and relate to in the Spider Man story and brings that to the screen beautifully. What's accessible about the character of Spider Man is that he (or she) is just a normal kid who gets these extraordinary powers and learns to become a superhero. As great a character as Iron Man is, it's pretty hard for a child to relate to the hard-drinking billionaire who happens to fight crime. Spider Man is relatable because he is a superhero every person can see themselves becoming in those circumstances. And that is the thesis of this film. Anyone can be Spider Man. The introduction of the Spider-Verse actually serves this message and enhances the story, which is what made the movie so enjoyable. At no point did the multi-verse concept feel like a device for selling toys (ahem... Porgs), but instead was a natural way to set up Miles Morales. There are only two things I could think of that could get criticized in Spider-Verse, the first is its inaccessibility to people who don't like Spider Man or superheroes, and the second is its visual style might not work for everyone. To address the first issue, I suspect there will be people who think this movie is only entertaining for people who already enjoy Spider Man properties, but I strongly disagree. Taking the Spider Man aspect out of this film, there's still a lot of great storytelling at work. Within this movie is a coming of age story about a black-hispanic kid trying to fit into his almost all-white high school, a story about a father trying to relate to his son, a story about a man who has given up on life who needs someone younger and more hopeful to show him the way, and a damn good science fiction story about a multi-verse. All of these narratives work without the superhero aspect, and I think make this film completely accessible to someone who has never seen a Spider Man movie before. The second issue about the visual style I understand a bit more, as initially the visuals didn't work for me. The style is shaky and imperfect and I felt like I was watching a 3-D movie without glasses. However, I realized they meant for the look to be imperfect and rough around the edges, just like worn out comic book come to life. I think part of the problem is that in recent years, with Pixar and Illumination movies, animation has gotten so refined and smooth, that is was at first off putting to see something break out of that mold. But after about 30 minutes, my eyes adjusted and I was able to get absorbed into the world they created. In summary, Spider-Verse is a mesmerizing movie that is firing on all cylinders and absolutely succeeds. It's funny, smart, heartfelt, with a message that makes me feel as hopeful and optimistic as I did when I was a kid seeing Toby Maguire become Spider Man for the first time. If you love Spider Man, you will 100% eat this movie up, and if you don't already love the wall-crawling hero, you will by the end of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Go see this movie!",

119,18 December 2018,Animated_Antic,9, An amazing and mind-blowing animated movie.,"Spider-Man has gone through a lot in film, hasn't he? From the trilogy directed by Sam Raimi with Tobey Maguire, to Marc Webb's two Amazing Spider-Man films with Andrew Garfield, and being in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Tom Holland. He has really been through a lot. So if you took him as well as many different incarnations of the comic book character and put them into one movie, you'd get ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"". It may seem like a really crazy idea, but here it works. And it works phenomenally well. This is such an amazing animated movie and is also a breakthrough for new animation technologies. I haven't really seen a full length animated movie like this until now and it really is mind-blowing. This seriously is such an amazing movie.",
120,16 October 2022,Dello_,10, An animation masterpiece,"""Spider-Man into the spider-verse"" is truly an animation masterpiece. It is hands-down the best Spider-Man movie, and one of the best superhero movies ever made. But why is it so? I usually tend not to give maximum ratings to movies, because I think that to be worthy of that 10/10 they need to be great, but also have something very special about them. In this case it is the animation style, that in the end is a comic translated into a movie. This animation is style is not only there to be beautiful, but also it enriches the scenes and the story points thanks to some inspired visual solutions. But is the plot able to take advantage of the animations style? Yes, it does. Indeed, it is entertaining, fun, but also profound and moving in few instances. And finally, also the score is really great and the songs are perfect. The best example of it is the ""what's up danger"" scene, that is able to give me chills every single time I watch it.",

It won the BAFTA, Golden Globe and eventually Oscar as well, not to mention managing a rare clean sweep for all its nominated categories at the Annie Awards. I will spare you the names of the many writers and directors here, as you can check them out for yourself, but the voice cast sure was spectacular. Lead actor Moore is not too famous and Johnson (who voices Peter Parker) is probably also only known to New Girl fans, but Steinfeld, Ali, Tomlin, maybe Pine and of course Nicholas Cage (Kick-Ass anybody?) should really be known to non-film buffs too. Maybe a few others as well. I mean there wasn't a voice performance that really stood out, but they were all rock-solid. Maybe American viewers will recognize them better. In terms of their voices.

147,28 November 2021,aidanratesmovies,10," Mediocre Spider-Man film, outstanding animation","Although on paper and of course aesthetically this film seems rather pleasing- Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse feels like a missed opportunity of epic proportions- hardly showing any emotion and lacking the depth to triscend it into something extraordinary. I'll start with the pros for this film, I love the animation. Yes it can be a bit jumpy and flashy at times, but it's an incredibly unique and magnificently detailed art style- not to mention its comic like quality in the terms of a comic book based superhero film. The voice work is also pretty well done for the most part, my favorite being Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker and the smaller cameos from John Mulaney and Nicolas Cage as Spider-Ham and Spider-Noir. The film has good intentions and a sweet message, and it's fun to see all the different variations of our favorite characters on screen, but it just seems to lack the emotional depth and charm that so many other films have. It's a trend that has taken a lot of potentially great superhero films down to blissful mediocrity, and never has it been more prevalent to me here. Its formulaic attributes and pacing, and even rhythm at times makes it seem more artificial than genuine and I just feel like it misses the point of what it is trying to say. It has all the right elements, and it even works at times, but it could have been so much more impactful than it was, and that just makes me sad. In the end, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is not at all a bad film, but a mediocre one with somehow high accord. I feel its potential is often greater than its execution and in most people's eyes, they may not be able to tell the difference. I just hope the second one is an improvement.",

I have never seen an animated movie that mixes together 4 entirely different art style so well. Sony has truly produced a masterpiece. When we talk about comic book movies, we too often think of everything that MARVEL has produced in the past 10 years, but into the spider-verse reveal to us what a comic book movie can be and should be. This is a movie that's special as it is.",
168,16 December 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,9, Amazing animation and a spectacular story; pretty much the ultimate Spider-Man picture.,"Just because 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)' is animated doesn't mean it's a 'kids' film. Here, the danger is always real, with the stakes never being anything less than (on-screen) death, and the experience is all the more exciting for it. Don't get me wrong, it's not overly grim; if you, or your children, have seen any of the web-head's previous films, you're probably good to go. This one is essentially everything you could want from a 'Spider-Man' story, an accessible yet comic-conscious blast from beginning to end. It really is an incredibly entertaining time, a joy of a movie that pretty much just gets better and better as it goes along. It manages to expertly mask its more conventional (though, as yet untold) 'origin story' elements behind its bolder and more unique 'multi-verse' motifs. You usually don't know what it's doing until it has just done it, even if what it has just done is the most by-the-numbers superhero plot-point you could possibly imagine, which makes for a refreshing, constantly original and highly enjoyable thrill-ride that's easily up there with the best of its genre. On top of all that, its phenomenal animation is literally groundbreaking, a unique blend of 3D and 2D that expertly evokes a 'comic-book' look. Because of this, as well as its quick pace, it's potentially the most lively and energetic film I've ever seen. It's amazing. Plus, it has one of the, if not the, best post-credits scenes of recent memory, one that not only bookends the piece with a relatively subtle yet still intriguing tease for the possible future of the franchise but also with the feature's best joke. It's a fantastic, genuinely funny note on which to end. 9/10",
169,16 December 2018,joexrayguy,10," Perfect, hits all the right buttons.","Absolutely spot on. Respects the history of the characters and story, but has a totally new fresh look. Visually amazing, its hard to absorb EVERYTHING that is going on on screen. I did have to go,out and make sure I wasnt in the 3D theater; some of the background items have a double outline that gave the impression of a 3D projection. I found out this was a production choice and I was in the right place. I think the way to tell a perfect melding of voice acting and production is when you look at the character onscreen and think ""Wow, they're really giving a great performance"" then realize, it's a cartoon, not a person in n the screen. You've been drawn in...they did their jobs well. Nice tributes to Ditko and Lee can be seen.",

This was just absolutely weird. This movie was just all over the place, I don't think Marvel could possibly have had anything to do with this mess unlike Spiderman Homecoming. I'm at a loss as to why Sony has problems making a decent Spiderman/Venom movie. Yes, I know Venom did well, but let's be honest, people only went because Homecoming was so good, so they thought Venom would be as well. They didn't know Marvel wasn't allowed to have any say on that film though, sadly.",

The traditional 2D animation mixed in with computer animation and cell shading technique is something that you have possibly never seen before.
The story is easy to follow because they explain it as the movie goes along, so you do NOT have to know about the comic books or much about this particular version of Spider-man.
Do yourself a favor and try to see this on a big screen such as IMAX. I saw it in 3-D and I can say it does add to the experience.
This movie is definitely in the running for not just best animated movie, but best movie of the year.",

Its visually stunning for an animation film and manages to be lively throughout by mixing humor and action like the Homecoming movie. But too often the characters are left under developed like the Spiderman Noir which really was disappointing because I was looking forward for Nicolas Cage. The soundtrack was fine and the song placements were perfect and as for the casting goes its very diverse and is a good representation for BAME. Overall its an interesting film with a great post credit scene but the major drawbacks are excessive action and a basic 3rd act.",

181,15 December 2018,Benslie,10, Perfect movie for everybody,"First of all, I love the animation style in this film. The animation in this film is styled to look like an actual comic book. I think this approach for this kind of film was an excellent choice because we've all seen the usual kind of animation but nothing like this. To tie in with the animation I need to talk about the action scenes in this film. These tie in with the animation because of the way the directors styled the action shots is to look like something in a comic panel. Most people don't know who Miles Morales is and after this film, you'll want to learn more about him because of how they made him so relatable in this film. He acts like a typical teen in this situation compared to other versions of Spider-Man. Other versions kind of just acted like they always knew how to use their powers when Miles struggles with his. Miles isn't the only relatable character film all of them are. The creators of this film did a ""Marvel""ous job at making each character in this film somebody at least one person in the audience can relate to. All of the voice actors did a great job in their respected roles but it would've been nice to have a returning voice to at least one of the Spider-Man. It would've been cool to hear a returning voice even if it was for a few seconds. I have to talk about the humour in this film. It isn't overpowered in this film and I felt like it had just the right amount of humour that will make everybody laugh. They poke fun of things that wouldn't make sense in a real movie and other Spider-Man movies. Not a single moment in this film felt rushed or slowed down every scene felt the right pace for a movie like this. The cinematography in this movie was spectacular. This is probably because of it looking like a comic book and how the lighting needs to match up with how it would look in an actual book. If you are a comic book junkie you'll love all of the easter eggs in this film. Some of them just comic book readers will get but others a majority of people will understand. The music in this film is fantastic. Every song in this film isn't overused and matches perfectly with the age of the character. Somebody Miles age would be listening to the type of music he listens to. And the music without lyrics helps increase the emotion in the film. Also, there are two end credit scenes that are worth waiting for. In the end, this film is perfect for everybody.",
182,6 December 2018,themadmovieman,9, Spellbinding,"This is a genuinely exceptional film. Away from the world of the big-budget, mainstream comic book movies, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse breaks boundaries with a stunningly original and fresh take on the classic superhero tale, combining hilarious self-referential humour with an equally thrilling story, all topped off with spellbinding visuals from beginning to end.",
183,16 December 2018,sunraider,5, Over-Hyped,"The most over-hyped movie of the year. Now, I'm not a comic book fan, nor an MCU fan although I've enjoyed a few, especially ""Spider-Man Homecoming,"" which I loved as I'm a sucker for those teenage, coming of age tales. The animation style was lovely in this movie but, the plot was humdrum and there was little character development and none of the witty repartee that is such a hallmark of the best animated films that appeal to both children and adults. This should have focused on Miles Morales getting a disillusioned Peter Parker to train him and get his mojo back. THe other iterations of Spider-Man were unnecessary. This was truly little more than a mediocre kids' animated movie. The small audience in my Friday morning theater was exclusively adult and there was little reaction from the audience throughout. Sitting in the Dolby theater, with the recliner in use, I actually thought about taking a snooze at least a couple of times during the movie.",

The movie is also very impactful of the drama (watch out Disney Sony is coming) what I liked about this movie is for the cultures of different people in this movie (Go Hispanics/african Americans and Japanese people). The different Spiderman/women even thought I know who they were but it was fun to see them in a short easy version of explaining their backstory in a very short time. The drama which is awesome ,which beats all the Spiderman movies on drama. This One is the king of Spiderman movies aside the Tobey Maguire trilogy and Andrew Garfield movies. This is by far the most ambitious to make the different art styles for each character and how they show New York in this version.

This film is Bendis on steroids and LSD. Peter Parker is a washed up white guy (hello America) and the future is Miles Morales - a black / latino kid & a white woman (Gwen) who is independent and puts Miles in the friend zone.

Nevertheless it was cool and the story was fun.
HOWEVER its clear the film was animated for 3D but when I watched it in my 2 d theater the normally blurred images in the background (the way we humans see things) were occasionally double images, the likes of which you see in a 3d movie when you watch for a second without the glasses.

206,20 December 2018,andreaf-78503,10, Sony's Redemption,"This movie was outstanding! After seeing The Emoji Movie last year, I had low expectations for any Sony movie coming out. After I found out this movie was coming out, I was nervous. Being a Marvel fan at heart, I didn't like the idea of a Marvel movie being put in the hands of Sony. After watching the trailers, I got more hopeful and decided I would check it out. And boy am I glad I did. This movie is one of my favorite animated movies of all time. Let's start with my favorite part of the movie, the animation. I absolutely loved the idea of an animated movie being told as a comic book. It was so colorful. Sure it was a bit blurry at times (once to the point where my friend thought we went to the 3D version on accident) but it made up for it. The part where the glass breaks from the building was beautiful. And Kingpin's body was hilarious. 10/10 for animation. Next, storyline. It was a pretty good story line, but it could've used a bit more work. The beginning was a bit confusing but I would say I was just about as confused as Miles was. One cliché thing though was that if the rest of the Spider people didn't get back to the universe they would disintegrate. Very funny Marvel, very funny. One thing that was really shocking was how(SPOLIER ALERT!!!!!!!) Aaron was secretly Prowler. That shocked the heck out of me. I liked Kingpin's motivation, but I could point it out a mile away. 8/10 for storyline. Last but not least, characters. I personally really enjoyed the characters. I loved that some of the Spider characters got a chance at the big screen. Miles was my favorite by far. I also enjoyed that they had a different version of Peter Parker. The middle-aged, overweight, divorced side of him. I wished they would do a bit more character development for the other characters though. 9/10 for characters. One last thing. I found it really touching that they did a tribute to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko after the credits. They would be very proud of this movie.",

Getting to see it in the theatre, I was blown away. The animation is fantastic, it has its own sense of style, but the colour palette is bright, and the movie is constantly moving throughout its environments. It looks as good as any big studio animation movie for kids if not better. What makes it even more amazing is how the action scenes are put together. They're stunning, the movie is inventive with how they use their characters and you never lose focus of what's happening, but you feel the hits and each character gets bad@$$ moments to show what they can do.

I mean I could give this film a 10 on animation alone. Its bright colors, fluid movements almost like a music video, and those comic book text boxes across the screen were a brilliant artistic choice. I realize that with movies like this the more obvious aspects like amazing action and visuals can make me not even think about the amazing character relationships and dialogue. The triangle between Miles, Jefferson an his uncle(sorry I forget lol) felt very realistic and grounded. Miles had a specific soft spot for his uncle, which was explored early on in the film. I really enjoyed how Jefferson wasn't a hardass annoying dad, and he wasn't a softie. He was just a guy, that wasn't 100% sure how to reach out to miles, but that didn't matter because he was doing his best. Also the talent from the amazing voice acting cast was undeniable. As a huge big mouth fan I kept finding myself laughing at John Mulaney as Peter porker. Not to mention they got Nicholas cage, who felt very natural for Spider noir. Who doesn't love that guy. I was pretty happy to see the concept of the multiverse explored in this movie, and I loved the brief, but still unique and interesting takes on each of the characters universe. I would love to see a solo movie for one of these characters, but I feel like thats a bit of stretch. I also want to talk about the most grabbing and probably the best aspect fo this film, the incredible visuals. I have always been a fan of animated films and TV, because with animation, there is not creative limit. Those limits, or lack there of is clearly on display for a majority of this film. Some of the shots and scenes (Especially the final act) just look like they would be incredibly difficult and/or expensive to film in live action. Not impossible though of course because we all saw ""Avengers: Infinity War."" Any-who I was constantly looking up at the screen in awe as I watched these beautifully animated and well developed swinging around the screen. I really enjoyed watching miles grow from not knowing what he was doing at all do understanding and really feeling his powers, with the help of Peter Parker. Speaking of Peter and Miles, I love the kind of relationship they shared, almost comparable to a really cool teacher and a student who desperately anted to learn everything. Overall this film had Excellent characters and character building, stunning visuals, beautiful animation, amazing cast, and an amazing script with dialogue that felt like a real conversation, and at times, very very funny. Point is go watch this movie ASAP it truly is a spectacular, colorful, work of art.",

248,24 October 2022,CinemaSerf,7, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,"I'm still a little wary of this multi-verse theme. I find it can lead to some seriously lazy writing as inter-dimensional characterisations can write, then re-write their own pasts and futures in a fashion that can become dull and repetitive quickly. This is not one of those. It centres around ""Miles"", a young lad who likes to hang out with his wayward uncle ""Aaron"" and who has a penchant for street art. It's whilst they are decorating an underground wall that he gets bitten by a spider and soon afterwards starts to feel the effects of his spidery-transformation. Meantime, the real ""Spider-Man"" aka ""Peter Parker"" falls foul of the evil ""Kingpin"" who has created a collider that will enable him to enter parallel realities in the hope of reuniting with his family, tragically lost to him years earlier. The more he messes with the timeline, though, the more chaotic the effects and the more our new, trainee, ""Spider-Man"" meets his equivalents from those different dimensions. It isn't long before they conclude that only as a team can they hope to thwart the megalomaniac and young ""Miles"" must find new inner strength to take charge of this mission to ensure all his colleagues get safely home. It's a good, characterful, story this - the youngster finding his feet and learning to use his new-found skills is entertaining to watch. The dialogue is frequently quite amusing, and the action scenes hold the attention rather than recycle themselves endlessly. As I watched it, I wondered if it might have made for a good exercise for 3D cinema. As it is, though, it's quickly paced with plenty of action, a little food-for-thought and it might just be the most ""human"" of the Spidey iterations I've yet seen.",
249,16 December 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9," Into The Spider-Verse crawls, swings and glitches its way in becoming the best Spider-Man adaptation.","It took Sony over a decade to finally create a decent superhero flick that involves not one web slinger, but six of them. Well, better late than never I suppose. However, it's not just a decent adaptation. Oh no no no! Much to my surprise (and everyone else's), it is one of the strongest superhero blockbusters to ever be released. In a time where saturation and fatigue is settling in, it is incredibly refreshing to see one beautiful animation reinvigorate an entire genre. Student Miles Morales is having a hard time dictating his own life, but after being bitten by a radioactive spider he soon comes to terms with his new powers. Stop right there! We've seen this far too many times now. Fortunately, something unique is injected into the repetitive origin story that we all know and love. Parallel dimensions are merged, forcing six alternate ""Spider-Creatures"" to team up and stop Kingpin from destroying worlds. So why after all these years does this work? Well, we actually have to thank the failures that came before it. The origin story has been told countless times, the writers know this and intelligently use that to their advantage. Satirising 'Spider-Man 3' and the infamous ""emo"" dance sequence. It almost lovingly pays homage to previous iterations, but translates the mediocrity into humour that consistently hits with every line of dialogue. Honestly, haven't laughed this much during a film in many years. The humour is never forced, with each punchline ingeniously executed heightening the personality of the various incarnations of Spider-Man. Mix that with the astute action that feels both chaotic and beautiful, creating frequent doses of entertainment.",

Basically teenager Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) admires Spider-Man, he struggles to live up to his parents expectations, his father Jefferson Davis (Brian Tyree Henry) is a police officer and sees Spider-Man as a menace. After Miles meets a new classmate who calls herself ""Gwanda"" (Hailee Steinfeld), he gets advice from his uncle Aaron Davis (Mahershala Ali), who encourages him to pursue her. Miles and Aaron hang out in a disused subway station painting graffiti, while there Miles is bitten by a radioactive spider and develops spider-like abilities. Miles later returns to the station and unintentionally finds a particle accelerator built by Wilson Fisk aka the Kingpin (Liev Schreiber) to access parallel universes to connect with his deceased wife and son. Spider-Man (Chris Pine) arrives to disable to accelerator, and fights against the Green Goblin (Jorma Taccone) and Prowler, Spider-Man and Miles meet during the battle and sense they are alike. Green Goblin tries to kill Spider-Man forcing him into the accelerator's energy stream but instead causes it to malfunction, he is killed while Spider-Man is injured. Spider-Man gives Miles a USB drive to disable the accelerator and warns that the city could be destroyed if the machine is turned on again. Spider-Man tells Fisk that his family is gone forever and that his plan will fail, Miles watches Fisk kill Spider-Man from a distance before escaping. The news of Spider-Man's death spreads all over New York, while Miles buys a Spider-Man costume and tries to master his own abilities, and inadvertently damages the USB drive. Miles meets Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson), an older and slightly podgy Spider-Man from another dimension, at the grave of the original Spider-Man. Peter has been brought out of his dimension by the accelerator and needs to return home, but he begrudgingly agrees to train Miles, in exchange for help stealing data to create a new USB drive. While breaking into Kingpin's research facility, Miles displays the unique abilities of invisibility and an electric ""venom blast"" that can disable enemies by touch. Fisk's Chief Scientist Dr. Olivia Octavius aka ""Doc Ock"" (Kathryn Hahn) confronts them and reveals Peter will slowly deteriorate and eventually die if he is not returned to his own dimension. ""Gwanda"" rescues Miles and Peter, her real name is Gwen Stacy, an alternate universe female version of Spider-Man, another dimension-displaced hero, she takes them to May Parker (Lily Tomlin), who is sheltering other dimension-displaced heroes. They are Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage), a dark and monochromatic version of Spider-Man from a 1930s universe, Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn) and SP//dr, a Japanese-American teenage girl from an alternative anime-like universe who co-pilots a biomechanical suit with a radioactive spider that she shares a telepathic link with, and Spider-Ham (John Mulaney), an alternate funny animal version of Spider-Man from an anthropomorphic universe. Being out of their own universes, they are also deteriorating, so Miles offers to disable the accelerator to send the other Spider-People home, but he is shocked to discover Prowler is his uncle Aaron, moonlighting as an enforcer for Fisk. Peni repairs the drive, but the group attacked by Fisk and his enforcers: Prowler, Octavius, Scorpion (Joaquín Cosio) and Tombstone (Marvin 'Krondon' Jones III). Miles flees during the battle but is captured by Prowler, who prepares to kill him, until Miles unmasks himself, causing Aaron to realize he has been hunting his own nephew. Aaron refuses to kill Miles, so Fisk shoots and kills Aaron, Jefferson sees Spider-Man over Aaron's body and mistakenly believes he has killed him, he radios in for the capture of Spider-Man. Miles angrily returns to his dorm, the Spider-People arrive and tell him that they, like him, have all lost someone they love. They leave to face Fisk, but Peter restrains Miles, leaving him behind for his own safety, deciding to sacrifice himself and taking Miles's place to deactivate the accelerator. Jefferson arrives outside Miles's door to tell him about Aaron's death and wants to apologise for his mistakes, Miles has finally gained control of his powers and heads out, spray painting one of Peter's suits as his own. He joins the other Spider-People at the accelerator and helps them defeat Octavius, Scorpion and Tombstone, though Peni's SP//dr is destroyed. Miles then activates the USB drive and sends all the Spider-People back home through the accelerator portal. Fisk and Miles fight throughout the accelerator, Jefferson arrives and realises Spider-Man is not the enemy, he encourages him, giving Miles the motivation to withstand Fisk's attacks and knock him out with his venom blast, which also destroys the accelerator. The authorities arrest Fisk and his enforcers, Jefferson recognises Spider-Man as a hero and Miles embraces the responsibilities of his new life. Back in their own dimensions, Peter attempts to reconcile with Mary Jane Watson (Zoë Kravitz), Peni rebuilds SP//dr and Gwen finds a way to contact Miles across dimensions. In a futuristic dimension, Lyla (Greta Lee), assistant to Miguel O'Hara aka Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac) informs him of the crisis and gives him dimension-hopping technology, he decides to ""go back to the beginning"", and ends up arguing with the 1960s universe version of Spider-Man. Also starring Luna Lauren Velez as Rio Morales, Natalie Morales as Miss Calleros, Lake Bell as Vanessa Fisk, rapper Post Malone as Brooklyn Bystander and Stan Lee in a posthumous cameo as a character named Stan who sells a Spider-Man costume to Morales. The voice cast are all great, and most of the characters are good, especially the 1930s gumshoe take on the lead character, and the Kingpin who is both menacing and in moments sympathetic, the Porky Pig style cartoon version of the hero is a little weird and makes almost forced laughs. It does get a little over-complicated at times, and maybe it is much more style over substance, in animation style, special effects, and big-scale sequences, I'm not sure where it fits in the world of superhero movies and it may confuse viewers, but the kids should have fun, an unusual but not bad computer-animated superhero action adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Featured Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Worth watching!",

He is smart, funny and brave and these are all traits you will look for in a superhero. But this Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse movie disappointed me very much. In fact, I would not call it a 'movie'. Its a more of a youtube video I would say. The inconsistent script, character popping up here and there like a popcorn. Total waste of 1h 57min of my life.",

To start things off, I'd like to say that I'm not the biggest fan of the past Spider-Man movies except for a couple of the originals. So coming into this movie I was not planning on liking it as much as I did, although I was hopeful after hearing about the great reviews it received. To keep this review simple I will not go into much detail in why I think it was so great but rather just state my overall opinions. There were hilarious moments, countless action scenes, a perfect amount of character development, and a phenomenal soundtrack to match today's modern culture. Also, the animation was so different than the standard and it really made you feel like you were watching an animated comic book. I definitely recommend you go see this movie as it's entertaining for people of all ages and will leave you wanting to watch more.",

While the film was somewhat enjoyable, it, it does not rate the incredible reviews that it received. It is a good movie that one might enjoy, but the animation is not great, and the voices are not great. I have seen many animated films, and there is an unnerving aspect to this. I would say that there is something missing, that is hard to describe. Perhaps it is the description of the characters, or the pace of the story, but this film did not feel right to me. I did not come out of the theater with that outstanding feeling that one gets when he has seen an outstanding film. Wish all the best who see this, but I would not recommend it ..",

I can safely say that Sony Pictures Animation has made the best Spider-Man movie to date, and best movie of the year. The story is your typical story, near the end it does get a little too bunched but I am more than willing to forgive it for that. The characters are excellent, I am no fan of anime at all but I loved the unique anime style and expressions Peni Parker gave, I loved the cartoonish nature of Spider-Ham, Related to the edgy nature of Spider-Man noir, Felt sympathy for Miles, emjoyed Peter Parker, and loved Gwen. The action is great, no more needs to be said.

It follows the style of a comic book and does it perfectly.",

306,29 December 2018,Henry-klein,7, Real and Objective Review,"I'm not caught up in the history of Spider Man or how the franchise has evolved over time. With that perspective, it's easy to judge this movie on its own merits. The animation is flat-out amazing. Rather than the the pages of a comic book coming to life, the creators have succeeded in pulling you into their world. Unfortunately, that's where it ends. The story line is passable but mediocre at best. The characters are bland and for an animated multi-verse the villains are uninspired and unmemorable. I'm glad I saw this in a theatre in 3-D because at home on a small screen it will be like watching a Sunday morning cartoon. Albeit, one with a 90M budget.",

313,2 January 2019,nate-car,10, I'd gladly pay to see another Spider-verse with Miles Morales...,"Some pretty dark elements for a PG movie, but overall a thoroughly exciting and enthralling Spider-Man movie that managed to be completely new and original while combining most elements of the first 5 films and several from comics and other media too.
Prowler is a real show stealer (which comic fans would never have predicted of this C-list villain) whenever he and his effects and music came on, the entire cinema held their breath and Miles Morales got such a strong showing in this, I'd gladly pay to see another Spider-verse starring him on the big screen!
All the villains were REALLY well designed (Dr. Ock is AMAZING...) Kingpin is finally done right! The first outing for Spider-Gwen was sweet and fun too.
Cartoony/corny Spider-Ham, Nick Cage (too famous a voice) and VERY graphic bloody murder were the only low points in an otherwise perfect film in almost every way!",
314,20 January 2019,khanbaliq2,9," Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is solid, entertaining, gritty, sharp, and funny.","Since a few people have asked me why I don't like Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse that much, I've decided to reveal my issues with it. First of all, I do like this film. It's easily the best wide-release film that's now playing in theaters, but I think that it's not a great film or the best Spider-Man film. The main character, Miles Morales, turns out to be one of the least appealing and least interesting characters in the film, although he's given plenty of time for character development. The most appealing character, in my opinion, is the original Spider-Man (Peter Parker or Peter B. Parker). Morales seems like a poor copy of the original Spider-Man, except that, for some reason, he also has additional, unoriginal powers like invisibility and bio-electric energy. In this case, the creators of this character just couldn't come up with a new, original superhero. This isn't surprising because hardly anything that's made by people in the American entertainment industry these days is original. Therefore, they took an old, beloved character and made him black. Morales isn't a terrible character. He's appealing, but he's lacking, in my opinion. In the film, Morales is also not a science wiz. He's simply a laid back, normal teenager, who just likes to draw and who even gets bad grades in order to transfer to a less prestigious school. Apparently, the filmmakers thought that such a character would be cool for today's audience and fine for being a superhero. This doesn't work, at least for me. Can this normal, laid-back teenager really be a superhero? Is he a good example for black teens and kids? In addition, there are, perhaps, too many Spider-Man characters and too many supervillains. A few of them are just ridiculous, though they're still kind of likable, and they add little or nothing beneficial to the film. The only character with enough development and enough appeal is, yet again, the original, Peter B. Parker. Still, even with all of this baggage, the film has several good scenes that make it worthwhile to see it again. The filmmakers can be praised because of this. But these scenes aren't enough to make Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse perfect or great. So, this is my take on Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse. It's very good, it's fresh and well-animated, but it's weighed down by a few poor characterization and filmmaking choices. That's too bad. The score for this film is nine out of ten from me.",
315,12 October 2020,SebMoz,10," The best animated movie since Spirited Away (Yes, I really mean that)","I originally didn't see this movie in theaters because I thought it was just gonna be a boring product-placement. And MAN was I wrong, because this is the best animated movie released this decade (in my opinion of course). Where do I even begin talking about it? Well let's see.",
316,17 March 2019,cherold,9, Wow,"Into the Spider-Verse has everything. I mean, it is stuffed to the gills with everything. The animation combines graffiti art, anime, and Warner Bros. cartoons. The story is a crazy kaleidoscope. So much happens on screen simultaneously that you can't possibly see it all. Characters are varied and engaging, ideas come at you like popping corn.",
317,5 July 2021,Drawmort,9, This is a groundbreaking animated movie!,"This is one of the most exquisite films visually speaking, but it is not just about its aesthetics as a complement or as part of the landscape, but this is taken and handled as an important part of the film's history. Rarely you see a movie made as meticulously as this one. Each and every detail is calibrated to its proper measure, like a Swiss watch made by a Japanese old guy.",
318,16 December 2018,sirquickie,9, Thank you! Stan Lee!,It was fun and funny. Everything that is in Spider-Man was shown in animation. It was curious to learn about each Spider. The picture is rich and dynamic. I was glad to see Stan!,
319,19 December 2018,iamabossnotreally,8, The Best Spider-Man Film,"I had very high hopes for Into The Spider-Verse. After seeing it, it surpassed my expectations. The best part of the film is easily the animation. It has so much personality and style. I hope more animated films in the future use this style. There is also some deep and dark elements to the story as well. The film isn't scared to dig into some dark material instead of only trying to appeal to children, and I can commend it for that. Another great thing about this movie is the characters. Some of the side characters like Spider-Ham don't build that much as characters but they never seemed like lazy characters. They all have their own personality and add a lot to the film. The more fleshed out characters like Miles, Peter, and Gwen are one of the biggest surprises of this film. Most super hero films don't try to flesh out their characters and mostly just try to make them cool. This movie takes time in developing those characters to make them more likeable. Especially the process Miles went through in this film was really impactful. There are a few issues I have with this film though. For some reason, they blur out of the backgrounds for some of the shots which bothered me because since the animation was so amazing I wanted to watch the environment and take in the art. Although, it may have just been the theater screen I watched the film on. Another thing is that the film gets a little cheesy near the end, but nowhere near annoyingly cheesy. So, I would highly recommend seeing this film. It's my favorite super hero movie of the past years and my favorite Spider-Man movie.",
320,3 January 2019,casperlowe,6, Funny but flawed.,"Overall I really did enjoy this film for the most part. For me it worked best when humour was used and it failed miserably in the ""emotional"" scenes but hey ho it is a cartoon aimed at kids so there is bound to be the odd saccharine moment (or ten) to be expected. Visually it was a bit of an assault on the senses at times but overall worked for the film. My most hated thing about the film was the gawd awful soundtrack. Highlight of the film goes to ""Spider pig""",
321,20 December 2018,EddyTheMartian007,8," A great Spider-Man movie, but it's rushed, with underdeveloped characters.","Woah this movie was actually really good. Into The Spiderverse follows Miles Morales as he has to stop a machine that is combining dimensions, and becomes the next Spiderman. I gotta say, I was really impressed. The animation is absolutely stunning, and there's a ton of animation jokes. I'm not really gonna talk anymore about the visuals, because that's been said to death, but the movie is just gorgeous. The action was also really engaging, it's all very fast paced, and while it can get weird at times, you can still follow it with ease. For an animated film this movie was surprisingly mature in some moments, and I think that's what makes it great. I mean damn characters actually die, and there are many emotional moments. Also there's themes of divorce, depression, among others. However I don't think this movie is the best Spider-Man movie, or even an amazing movie. I do have to say this movie definitely understands the character of Spider-Man, and I love the theme of everyone can become Spider-Man. My real problem comes with some of the characters. Miles is the only character that gets significant development in the movie, and in the respect it's excellent. Miles has some really great emotional moments and Shameik Moore does a great job voicing him. In fact the whole voice cast does a phenomenal job. However apart from Miles no other character gets significant character development. I mean I get it, this is Miles movie, and they should develop his character the most, but the other characters are really 1 dimensional to me. While all the other alternate dimension Spider-Man were very entertaining, I really don't care about them. The older Spider-Man was done really well though. He does have his own little arc in the movie. He's definitely well developed. You can see he's reluctant to mentor Miles, but he knows it's the right thing, and Miles needs this. Again apart from those characters we get the most basic information of everyone else. Each character just gives their origin, and that's it. We don't know anything else about them. Those scenes were handled very well though, without making them too repetitive, but the other characters barely have anything to them. The same thing unfortunately happens with the villains who are all severely underdeveloped. The only 2 villains we know anything about are KingPin and Prowler. We get KingPin's motivation early on, which was done once again very well, but that's the only thing we know about him. The same thing happens with the prowler, except we don't even know his motivations, he just has a connection to a character. This really hurt the movie for me because while Miles, and the older Peter were well developed, everyone else kinda fell flat for me. They aren't bad, but they just feel like a shell. However characters like Miles' Dad, KingPin, Prowler, and Gwen were good despite this. Now I know that's a significant flaw, but this movie is still great. I'm focusing on the negatives because everything else is so good. Like the soundtrack, which is brilliant. I do think some music choices were odd, but the Prowler's theme is fantastic, and so is most of the score. Also The humor, which is done well. However Another issue I have with the film is it being kinda cliche. I mean removing the Dimensional travel stuff, this is the average coming of age, origin story. For example for most of the movie Miles has no idea how to use his powers, but when he needs it the most he now suddenly, and perfectly knows how to use his powers. Again though it's done very well either way considering this is an extremely fast paced movie, and it does feel rushed sometimes. Also there's some noticeable plot convenience, especially in the 3rd act. I have some other specific issues with the movie, these might be considered minor spoilers so you've been warned. In the beginning it's mentioned how they can't turn on the machine or else it'll end destroying Miles' dimension, however later on in the movie, it changes to letting the other Spidermen enter their dimensions quick enough. Also that part is very convenient. They use, basically a flash drive to stop the device, and that can somehow control which dimensions each character goes too? Anyways my final issue is a very specific one. There's this moment where KingPin shoots a certain character (which was an awesome moment) but it doesn't make sense that he wouldn't shoot Miles too. I mean he probably could've dodged the bullets with his spider-sense, but KingPin doesn't know this, it just didn't make sense. However I do think overall this movie is great. It's very mature for an animated movie, it's animated extremely well, it has great voice actors, it's just great overall.",
322,15 December 2018,augustdraper,10, This blew me away!!!,"I rarely ever make movie, but I had to on this one. I remember seeing the trailer for this and saying ""this lowkey looks bad."" Months go by and I start seeing reviews saying ""Best film of 2018"" This film is amazing"" so on and so on. Then I was like okay, I should go this. I saw yesterday with my film class and I blown away, like I mean blown away. The story was so well written, like certain foreshadowing and elements that came back in the end from the beginning. It was so well done. The relationships between Miles/Uncle Aaron and Miles/His father are super well done. It highlights the complexities of role modeling, which I love. Miles is such an authentic teenager and the way puberty is portrayed is too relatable in this film. Just the overall story was fantastic. The music works super well with the film, which always is something I appreciate. Sometimes, it gave me straight goosebumps for a solid 5 minutes. And let me tell you, the final fight scene!!!!!!! I'm not going to spoil it, but it's something the MCU could never pull off. It's one of the coolest fight scenes I've seen in a long time. Also, not to be political or anything, but this is the only film that I've seen where the friend zone is accepted. It's really a nice refresher of every movie that I have seen that always has the main character fall for the attractive female character. Overall, the entire blew my expectations out of the water.

8 hrs ·
I'll run out of superlatives describing how good this movie is. Not only is it already my favorite best comic book movie but it may even be one of the best animated films I've ever seen, rivaling Pixar's best. The animation pops and brings comic book pages to life right down to the 'Kirby Krackle'. Animators have attempted this unique blend of 2D and 3D animation styles that just work wonders in translating the comic book feel to motion unlike anything before. A very visionary alternative to the 3D Pixar style that has become the industry standard since Toy Story back in 1995. It's even psychedelic in parts. They've done some clever use of dialogue boxes, thought bubbles and transitions that are unique to comic books. Every single frame is brimming with Spiderman references ranging from iconic to those obscure deep comic book lore. The screenplay is crisp and sharp too. I'd totally be okay if the current live action superhero boom ends with Avengers 4 next year (just because I'm already committed) and shifts to this format going forward. #IntotheSpiderverse is an innovative, kinetic and endearing masterpiece. If you have the option to watch only one movie this holiday season then pick this one.",

Even Spider-Man Homecoming I can't say is that good, and that was done by Marvel Studios. I initially liked it when it came out, but it's only gotten worse over time.

345,9 January 2019,WooderIce64,10, Best Spider-Man Movie.,"Sony Pictures Animation has had its ups and downs. It had critical and financial success with Hotel Transylvania but stooped as low as the Emoji Movie in 2017. However, they bounced back the following year with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which is undoubtedly their best movie, and one of the best animated movies of the decade. While Sony has made 5 Spider-Man movies since 2002 (not counting the Venom spin-off), this is the first one to not focus on Peter Parker, but rather on Miles Morales. Miles is hesitant to take on the superhero life due to his school life and his cop father's disapproval of Spider-Man in general but is encouraged after witnessing the death of Peter Parker. While that sounds like a major spoiler, it happens 20 minutes into the movie. He spends the movie learning what it means to be Spider-Man, and how much harder it is than it seems. Miles' arc is handled very well, and he develops well from not wanting to have his powers at all to embracing his new role as Spider-Man.",

The characters worked out well, but I wanted to see more of the relationship between Miles, Peter and Gwen. And also see more Fisk, as he showed little. And perhaps this is the only drawback for me.

My kids enjoyed it about as much as I did (I'm 35, they're 6, and we all love superhero movies). I really enjoyed the movie at times, and was bored at other times. The comedy was great and the plot was original/decent. For the first 30 minutes of the movie, I thought we were being shown the 3-D version. I looked around to see if people had the glasses on. The random guy next to me was doing the same, and he left to get glasses for him and his kids.

364,4 June 2021,kevin_robbins,10, This may seriously be my all-time favorite Spider-Man movie,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) is a movie my fiancée and I caught in the movies upon its release. The storyline takes place when the son of a police officer, who enjoys spraying graffiti and making murals in New York, is bitten by a spider while working on one of his projects. As you'd expect he gains super powers; however, shortly after gaining his powers he witnesses a murder by a current serial killer and barely escapes. Now the serial killer wants to uncover who the witness is and make him disappear. This picture contains voices by Mahershala Ali (Green Book), Zoë Kravitz (X-men: First Class), Shameik Moore (Dope), Chris Pine (Wonder Woman), Liev Schreiber (Ray Donovan) and Nicolas Cage (Face/Off). The storyline for this picture is outstanding and contains so many coming of age elements. The depiction of Miles Morales, the depth of his family, the explanation of the Spider-verse, the villain and the action are all remarkable. The animation style is unique and absolutely awesome. This may seriously be my all-time favorite Spider-Man movie. I would easily score this a 10/10 and recommend adding it to your collection.",

Lord and Miller once again prove their ability as Hollywood screenwriters, bringing their wits and smarts along with them. SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDERVERSE does everything a comic book film should, it has heart, humor, scope, stakes, it's well paced, and has a genuine message of what it takes to be a hero, and it starts with a leap of faith.

What I love about a film like ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is that a wide range of young kids can watch this film and see in it people who look and sound like them. It resembles the world as it actually exists rather than the worlds of most super hero movies, where white men are constantly saving the day. It also has a funky sound and look to it.

I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me! It's better than any film Pixar has produced (with the exception of Coco). The story is great. Hey, it's from Phil Lord, one of the directors of The LEGO Movie, another visually stunning film. The voice acting and music are both phenomenal, and I have to give a truckload of credit to Shameik Moore for his performance as Miles Morales. This movie just proves that anyone can wear the mask.",

The brilliant living comic-book experience of Spider-Verse came alive in our imaginations and enhanced and upgraded the colorful pages comic books for a whole new generation. The storyline of alternative Spiderman possibilities while definitely not new in the sci fi movie industry, it finally brought out the quantum possibilities described in superhero comic books that have been around for decades with a pizzazz and an excitement. The humor incorporated into movie's dialogue is like a live comedic act that brings continuous smiles throughout the movie while its emotional drama and bittersweet edginess offers up a refined balance to the entire film. There is a human genuineness and emotional connection to the audience with a surprising focus on father-son relationships.

We have already had entirely too many Spider-man movies, and the concept's kinda weird, and they are trying to fit WAY too many characters and plots into this one story."" I could not have been more wrong. The degree of difficulty here was super-high, but Marvel still stuck the landing. They introduced a new Spider-man while paying homage to other Spider-man stories and creating something that felt entirely original...and they did it without rehashing the origin story all over again. There were moments where there was a little too much happening, but the choices almost entirely paid off and almost all the characters were given their due. Plus, the animation was just plain gorgeous and the soundtrack was great. Overall, it was a great movie experience.

This film really hits every emotion possible and has such strong themes running throughout. I thought that the quirky characters would really make this movie childish but it benefits the movie greatly, I didn't particularly think the side characters where expertly written but they for very well with the story and interact well with the other characters. The prowler is also one of the most badass villains ever and the noise that place when he shows up is so menacing. The comedy is nailed in theirs as well with the funniest character for me being spider-noir played by Nicholas Cage which was so unexpected. I can't wait for the second one, and if you haven't watched this because ""I don't like animated movies"" or because ""animated movies are for children"" then you are a criminal. 9/10 must watch.",
450,18 December 2018,clock_me,4, I hate miles,"First of all I have never hated a spiderman character more then Miles mourlas
it takes him 1hour and 30 minjust to learn how to use his powers and we only we see him at full capacity for less then 15 min
also it takes an hour before we see every multi verse spiderman come into play
for about 35 or so mins all we really see is miles just stumbling trying to figure out what is happening to him and as he talks to himself it getès so annoying i just want to clog my ears
the animation looks like an old video game i used to play wish i could remember which one and the music through out the film is bad bad bad
and there are only a few jokes in the movie that get a laugh or 2
with only 50 mins left in the movie we really don't see very much of the other spiderman fight until the very end and even then poky and nic cage have less then 10 min of actual fight time like i said it focus most on miles and man is he an idiot for most of the film it was very cringy another thing if i remember peter never had a father in the movies or the comics so why did he it confused me and I don't ever remember a female doc oc one last thing wtf is with the size and look of the king pin he is ugly anyway will not be buying or watching this again Ièll stick to the other flims they are way better",

The writing, the score, the action, the comedy, the characters and most of all, the message. The message of Into The Spider Verse is that anyone can wear the mask. This is heart-warming and only adds to the amazing list of spectacular (2 spidey jokes in one) things to love in the movie. Usually I say in my reviews not to expect an oscar worthy film but this time I think you should. Loved it so much and is in my top 3 favourite Spider-Man movies. Can't wait for the sequel and third one. 10/10. Goodbye, have a great day and thank you for reading. :)",
452,7 December 2018,stevendbeard,8, Different Versions of Beloved Hero,"I saw ""Spider_Man:Into the Spider_Verse"", starring the voices of Shameik Moore-The Get Down_tv, Dope; Jake Johnson-New Girl_tv, The Mummy_2017; Hailee Steinfeld-The Pitch Perfect movies, Ender's Game; Nicolas Cage-Dog Eat Dog, the Ghost Rider movies and Liev Schreiber-Ray Donovan_tv, Salt.
This is an animated Spider_Man movie that gives you a look at the different Spider_Men from alternate dimensions-it's also the first animated Marvel movie to be rated 'PG'. Those familiar with the comics know all about these spin off heroes. Shameik plays Miles Morales/Spider_Man, who runs into Jake/Peter Parker/the original Amazing Spider_Man-notice the 'Amazing' in his name? That's how you tell them apart in the books-after Liev/the Kingpin causes a dimensional rift that lets the others visit his world. Hailee/Spider_Gwen and Nicolas/Spider_Man Noir are a couple of the other Spider_Men that make it through the rift. There is also a Japanese Manga robot Spider_Girl and a Spider_Pig. Jake and the others help train Shameik in the use of his new talents-some are a little different than Jakes'-to make him Spider ready. Stan Lee makes his usual cameo and I heard that this was his last voice_acting role. There is a lot of humor throughout the film and it is pretty good-sometimes I had a hard time hearing everything because of the audience laughing so loud. Some of it is even 'nods' to the live action films and tv shows. And make sure you stay after the end credits because there is a nice scene with another Spider_Man not shown earlier.
It's rated ""PG"" for action violence, thematic elements and some mild language and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes.
I am a big Spider_Man fan-Amazing & otherwise-and I really enjoyed this look at the different versions of the beloved hero. I would buy this one on Blu_Ray.",

457,23 February 2019,carlos-darkestembrace,10, What did I just saw?,"I'm watching this movie as I write this review. It's weird. I've seen hundreds of movies, from fantasy to sci fi, horror and everything in between. I've seen LOTR, Titanic, Into the Wild, and so many others and all of those movies had something that would made me feel. Feel the history, the characters and their pain or their joy. And... there's Spider Man - Into the Spider Verse. And it's the first time I shed a tear in a movie.
Spider man's death is one of the most powerful scenes I've came across in any media in any genre.
Spider man. Our friendly neighbourhood Parker. Its has been with us, with you and me, for more than 30 years an for some, more than 50. Whether you like comics, books, movies, games, cups, magnets, toys, he's been with you. And, in a brief moment, for those who knew the character and the humanity he brought into a 2 dimensional universe where everyone with a cape can be Super, but not a man, we felt the pain. The pain of those who in that fictional universe, lost, such an amazing person. We felt it and we morn it as if it was one of our beloved friends taken from us, because this, this is how BIG, more than life itself, this character is.
This moment, and the incredibly gorgeous animation is in, deserves my respect. I salute you, animator, director, sound designer, voice actor, coffee boy, donut boy, and every single person that worked in it: Congratulations, you made an outstanding job and I sincerely believe that, if alive, Stan Lee would aplaude it as loudly as I did.

458,2 March 2019,El-Ak,9," ""It's just a leap of faith"" and this unique movie did it, way to go everybody.","I begin with a simple question ""why did it take more than 20 years of modern animation to think to make superheroes from comic books an animation comic book style movie?"".
I think that it's one of the unique animation films you gonna ever see. The rendering style of the comic books that the animation is based on in no doubt superb and I feel it fits superheroes more than the marvel kinda thing though I am not quite sure as both are very extraordinary. The movie is creative and gonna be the first in a series of non boring superheroes movie that made a category for itself in this unique rendering style. The animation along with the movie's score are the heroes of the film with a tons of visual metaphors. The story itself is unique and creative but it was just so quick in it's events along with some of the action scenes which seemed very unclear and random and went out of order especially in the ending scene. Also the ending scene of the story along with it and the dimensions kinda stuff went out of order and made me confused especially the story and the origin of the multiple Spider-Men especially that of Spider-Woman and her relation with Peter Parker who is from another dimension than her! The 3 other Spider-Men were for me neglected and wasn't defined enough for that some of their powers were mentioned in the trivia of the film here on imdb that I didn't know about. The movie itself deserves a 10/10 for as a whole picture which was a real adventure that could have gone wrong but it went out with stealing an Oscar from Disney's movies at the end of the year marking a complete surprise and a well deserved win indeed. It stole it with the catchy story and the idea of multiple Spider-Men and the crazy costumes along with the comic book animation style, light comedy, score and songs and most importantly the comments that we are used to see in a comic book like ""booooow"" which was terrific. The classy Spider-Man jumping and swinging from a building in the end scene in this movie's style with the literally out of this world cinematography making a great combination with the costumes and again the animation. As for me, the movie is described by one word which is ""wooooooow"" and would give it a 10/10 (which it deserves) but for the storyline and unclear action and fight scenes along with the ending though it's superb. Don't you dare miss it 9/10",

Eventually, his paths collide with Peter Parker as well as several others, as they must stop a villain named Kingpin. The film's stylized animation style is intended to look and feel just like a comic book, and that it does. While some viewers might find it a bit jarring from time to time, the animation looks outstanding and has an extraordinary level of attention to detail. A scene near the climax with Miles Morales web-swinging through Manhattan is utterly stunning.

One of the most prominent writers of the comic is Dan Slott, who's long run provided some of the most barmy, adventurous stories of the comics history. One of his most notable arcs was Spider-Verse, which was a fun, crazy storyline that introduced the concept of multiple Spider-Men and Spider-Women joining together. With this storyline, the Spider-Man multiverse was created, and serves as the influence for this latest Spider-Man film. Miles Morales was first introduced in the Ultimate universe as the new Spider-Man who takes on the mantle after Peter Parker is killed.

I grew up watching the 1990s animated Spider-Man show, so when I saw early trailers for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), I half-thought it would be some direct-to-video movie. After all, everything up until now had been live-action. I was encouraged to learn that it would receive a theatrical release, especially when I started to see more footage of its unique artistic style. Not only does Into the Spider-Verse embrace its comic book origins, but it also does so with a flair and panache that I'd almost like to see in other superhero franchises.",

The dialogue was over-the-top intelligent, witty, comically self-effacing at times. I had to use subtitling just to keep up w/the depth of satire, banter, burlesque.

A lot of the humour is really good (although I don't really like Spider-Pig that much) and the villains are really well-developed.

534,23 March 2023,Elvis-Del-Valle,9, Marvel's first great cinematic adventure through the multiverse,"Visually stunning and surreal, this film is a work of art for its combination of traditional animation and CGI. Although this film was made by Sony, there is no doubt that this is the one that begins the concept of the multiverse in Marvel's filmography, which would later begin to be applied in the MCU by relating it to Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, the saga from The Amazing Spiderman, the X-Men saga and the SSU. Of course, the multiverse started being used in the comics and is now being used in the movies, expanding Marvel's filmography in a crazy and exciting way. In addition, this film clarifies a mystery about what would happen if Peter Parker at some point would leave and who would replace him. The answer here is Miles Morales, who also receives the powers by chance. Other points to mention are the post-credits scene that connects to the 1960s animated series and the feud between Wilson Fisk and Spider-Man that is reminiscent of the 1990s animated series. This movie and its sequel leave the door open for that everything is possible in the multiverse without exception, as seen in the MCU, which is of enormous importance in Marvel's filmography. Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse is undoubtedly the ideal film to start getting to know the multiverse once you have seen the movies and series that Marvel has made before and start this multiversal journey that for someone who likes Marvel is a beautiful wet dream. My rating for this movie is 9/10.",
535,16 December 2018,ciaramellam,10," Thank you, Marvel!","Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse
Non-spoiler review
Easily the best Spider-Man movie made to date. That's isn't much of a stretch, because the others, while some have been good, are just not great. Why is this the best? Simply stated, it is 100% faithful the the source material-the Marvel Comics.
While the mainstream Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is fantastic, those movies have been adapted for mainstream audiences and morphed into their own laws of their established sense of reality. This movie about the Spiderverse is straight off the colorful pages of the comics. The one true Peter Parker Spider-man, from Earth 616, does not appear in the movie. Instead, the main character is the Miles Morales Spider-Man from Marvel's Ultimate Universe, an alternate dimension that exists as part of the greater Marvel Comics universe. The 616 Spider-Man was created by the late GREATS Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, who both passed away this year. Miles was created by the man who had written the majority of all Marvel comics over the past 20 years, Brian Michael Bendis. For someone who has read comics for most of his life, I am happy to report this is the first theatrically-released superhero movie that is a faithful adaptation of the comics. Thank you Mr. Lee, Mr. Ditko, and Mr. Bendis for creating this AMAZING universe and thank you Columbia Pictures for visualizing THEIR original creations on the big screen. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Excelsior!

537,10 January 2021,fciocca,7," Loved the idea of the mutiverse, stunning animation, a mix of different styles.","After watching the entire MCU, that I have criticized several times for its lack of originality, finally Sony releases a good movie about Spider-Man, that really looks different and entertaining. I really hope that there will be a sequel. Visually speaking is something truly original, compared to the vast majority of these super hero flicks: seems to see a comic book coming alive. The animation removes also all technical limitations that directors might have with a live-action production. There are a lot of action packed sequences and there are some shots that contribute to add a lot of dynamicity. There are tons of graphical effects, but they are never over the top, it is a very colorful and vibrant film. Different kind of animation are merged together, there is Peni Parker that has an anime-style drawing and Spider-Man Noire, straight from a 40s investigation novel. From a technical perspective it is amazing.",

I didn't change my thoughts on the film throughout the several months leading up to watching it. That is until five minutes into the opening scene. The rich, vibrant animation was an enigma to me at first. Swirling, spinning web-slinging (excuse the pun) spectacles and characters took a second to wrap my head around, but once the film had fully immersed me, I had been 'thwipped' to my seat.",
541,5 January 2019,timuriv,5, am i watching the same movie?,"This movie has one of the most boring and predictable story lines I've seen in a long while. i'm giving spider-verse 5 stars out of 10 because the animation is beautiful, especially the comic book spreads but the animation cannot hide the plot weakness, since if you know the title and the first few minutes of the movie, you largely know the plot. The only reason I didn't leave one hour into the movie is because my companion fell asleep and i didn't want to wake them up, but the movie is also painfully long. Bottom line, I would rather have spent my time re-watching Tobey Maguire's 2002 spider-man.",

Unfortunately, I'm not a huge Spidey fan, so that rating I just gave might get a little bit biased, but it's still great, fun, funny, cool, and unique. Not to mention the deep message it carries throughout the film: being a Spider-man doesn't mean one is the strongest and the most perfect being of all time, the persistence, standing up for what you believe what is right despite the odds of winning, rising up no matter how many times one got punched, no matter how strong those punches are, no matter how fall or hard you fall, is what makes you a Spider-man, or Spider-woman if you're a woman (and of course the web slinging thing).",

The animation is on point, a real spectacle, and while some hate on the comic-style it goes for, I personally couldn't be happier with it. The multiverse is a very hard concept to explore, but this movie did it perfectly and really made a simplistic version for those not quite understanding of it. Each multiversal character is a blast. And every main character has some sort of arc that I'm pleased with, but Miles' is poetic and a true masterpiece. He goes from the clumsy kid to a skilled Spider-Man, and the scene that implies that is breathtaking. It's definitely my favorite animated movie of all time, and I can't wait for a sequel soon.",

However, with so much going on, lots of psychedelic colours and flashing lights combined with a 3D effect, it was a bit too much at times.

However, if we distance ourselves from the design: the plot is somewhat boring and very predictable. Due to the excessive amount of new characters they were not developed and seemed to be very one-sided. Indeed, it is not possible to sit on a fence in this case, but I would like to see fewer characters, but know more about each of them.

This is the first comic film that truly embraces its roots. These guys took what a great comic is and amplified it for the film medium. Character designs are awesome including a nod to Bill Sienkiewicz amazing work. And finally, the story and direction are pitch perfect. Can't wait to seem more movies from Lord and Miller.",

626,26 December 2018,statuskuo,7, Thank Donald Glover,"Ever since Glover begged to be a ""Black Spider-Man"", people were intrigued by the idea. Except purist nerds. So, here's your version where you can have two Peter Parkers in their 30's (?) and have the Black one too. Because they open up a universe that allows anyone to be Spider-man, if you can be bit by a radioactive spider, you can be a web spinning one. Okay, that's not the point to this movie though. It's basically to forgo the logic of...common sense. As in, how many radioactive spiders exists in New York City (the one this Spider-Boy exists in) Answer: Too many to deal with.
Look, it's a massive leap into a franchise that is overdone and boring. In fact, they joke about it. But the flash and dash and clever animation is brilliant and deserves the accolades, it still seems a little forced. Consider the logic again. Trying to tie some alternate universe into a changing storyline is things J.J. Abrams got a ton of flack for, somehow...fans forget his ""Star Trek"" went over this territory already.
Okay, nuts and bolts aside, it's fun. And funny. And good enough where you don't have to think too hard about these things. Kingpin, the villain, isn't just comically villainy. There is a point to his madness. And there are enough fun moments with Doc Oc or Liv that make it enjoyable.
Great way to launch a new style of animation others will start to rip off.",
627,30 December 2018,mr_bickle_the_pickle,9, A Great Origin for Miles,"This movie is such a delight. Its funny, its heartfelt, theres lots of cool action and theres lots of bright colours. I really loved Miles Morales. I didnt know much about his character going in, but I would totally love to see more of him going forward. Even before the film ""Spider-manned"" I was thoroughly enjoying the movie as a teen comedy. I also liked that they mixed different animation styles together, and that it also felt like a comic book was literally coming to life. It was also shocking, I wasnt expecting the death of a certain character (won't say who). Wilson Fisk/Kingpin wasn't as menacing as he is in the Daredevil TV show, but he was still pretty good. Doc Ock was good too, but I still overall prefer the Doc Ock in Spider-man 2. So even though the villains lacked a little for me it definitely was made up for by the various spider-mans. I loved Miles as I already stated. I thought Jake Johnson was really good as a somewhat bitter Spiderman, John Mulaney as Spider-Ham was funny and surprisingly works in this world, Spider-man Noir was great too and I think Nic Cage was the perfect fit for it, I also really liked Spider-Gwen and would like to see more of her too. Stay through the credits, you a) get a fantastically funny Christmas song as well as a funny after credits scene.",

629,16 December 2018,jdbaker-55122,9," Wow! Just, Wow!","This movie is not only going to redefine what an animated movie should look like, it's going to raise the expectation level of what any superhero movie should feel like. The creators combined traditional animation with pixar-style animation and then went even further and developed a new way of blending colors, text, dialogue and music so the audience feels like they are living inside a comic book. I actually tried to find a scene or moment where the animators maybe cheaped out or half-assed something and I couldn't. Every scene, every sequence . . . hell, every frame was stunning.",

632,9 February 2019,weirdedout,10, An amazingly innovative piece of Animation,"Alright, I'll say it, we are oversaturated with bad and tired animation nowadays. However, Spiderman breaks the mold in every way, being one of the most beautiful and innovative pieces of animation that has ever been created. It is in the top 5 pieces of animation ever created in my opinion. It's relatable, and shows us that it doesn't matter what we look like or where we come from, anyone can wear the mask. Not to mention, it is the ONLY comic book movie that has been created to date in my opinion. The dotted and comicbook-driven aesthetic is unbelievable, and captures your attention every moment of the film. An absolutely wonderful movie that has deserved every award it has already won, and every award it is up for in the future.",
633,13 December 2018,ridwaneaissaoui,9, Probably the best Spiderman movie,"I am notre a huge fan of any of the Spiderman movies from the last decade. Raimi's trilogy, the Amazing films, and homecoming though good had a lot of major flaws. This time they focus on a different Spiderman and the overall message of the movie is that basically anyone could be Spiderman. This idea allows the spectator to easily relate to the main character which works perfectly. You feel everything the lead is going through, from his excitement to his fears. I'm not usually a big fan of origin stories, but this one I really loved. I guess the movie might be a little bit difficult to follow if you're going blind into the movie (if you don't know anything about Spiderman before watching this one). But aside from that it's an extremely creative movie, with compelling characters and amazing pop-style animation (very stylized so it might not appeal to everyone but it definitely worked for me). The comedy works, the drama is also effective, I just don't see any major flaw especially comparer to other Spiderman films. It's just a great movie that almost redeems Sony animation for making the emoji movie. I really hope it does well in theaters and that we can get a sequel because this spiderverse has a lot of potential if it's treated this way.",
634,6 March 2019,undeaddt,9, No space for competition here.,"The best piece of art that was made in 2018 and among the best in the 21 century. It is understandable why they needed 4 years to create this eye watering beautifulness. I just can't believe how amazing this animated movie is, the combination of 3D and 2D animation along with moderately used CGI is the best formula that will be used by many others in the future, I can guarantee it. The story is beautiful and full with amazing characters that complement each other all the time, nothing feels to rushed or to long and boring. It has a very interesting ending, altho my only issue would be the fact that I wanted a bit more action seen from the heroes that come from the other universes. That would be my verdict.",

636,30 December 2018,gcsman,8, A pyrotechnical must-see for Marvel fans,"This is a fun, dazzling ride, no doubt at all. It's a Superhero Origin Story (young Miles Morales gets the radioactive-spider bite, but with some different results than we were expecting), an alternate-universes story (several Spideys from different universes all piled together), and a warm-hearted family drama (Miles learns his favorite uncle isn't to be admired after all, and snaps back to realizing how good his parents are after all). And it's an ultra-dazzling CGI display with style to burn. I came out of the theater with the feeling that I'd been immersed in an actual comic book for 2 hours. There's clever use of visible word balloons and sound effects (e.g. 'Thwip!"" appears on the screen as Spidey shoots his webbing) and lots of split-screen action as if you're seeing several panels on a comics page at once.",

Got to watch it on the first day of release, gotta say the studio was not jam packed as it hits cinema while lots of people are also watching aquaman. Okay so for the movie GORGEOUS animation, great music, fantastic story. Bored of spider-man origin stories? The movie gives you 7 origins!! Yeah thats right 7 and presented in such fun but heartwarming way that you will smile and also care for each characters. Humorous, sad, great actions, and tons of easter eggs this is just what you would want from a Spider-Man movie. Spider-Man is my favorite marvel super hero and i gotta say i never enjoyed a Spider-Man movie quite like this, every moment of the movie i was like ""oh thats from..."" ""hey thats..."" if you're a fan like me you won't stop looking and noticing the easter eggs even till the final after credit scenes, and non fans you will be a Spider-Man fan after this movie!

638,24 December 2018,rpherigo,10, One of the all-time greatest animated films of all time,"I have rarely been so completely blown away by every facet of a single film as I was by this movie. The soundtrack is stellar, the voice acting literally could not have been better, and the animation! The ANIMATION!!!! The art style was so unique and gorgeous, I kept whispering ""wow!!"" like every ten seconds. And to cap it all off, the story, the lovely, perfect story. You think you've seen Spider-man, you think you know what to expect. This was so much more than just an origin story. This was a whole world. This was a boy reaching for everything he could be. And it was a look into what makes Spider-Man one of the most beloved Marvel characters. It isn't just that he punches bad guys and saves the day. It's that he loves the people he saves, and craves connection to the people in his life and his city. This movie had so much heart. I cannot recommend this movie enough. Please go see this movie!!",

This 'art style' is like when a cartoon tv show has no more budget and they draw half of what they need to make a fluid motion picture. People who just accept this as acceptable or even edgy, just don't understand. It's unpolished and unfinished. Feels like you're watching a story board. Get the point?",

644,26 December 2018,barca_AW,7, Good!,"I did not expect such a good movie going into another Spiderman Movie. But Marvel did a great Job showing us another Story out of their huge Comic Book Universe.
But seeing only 10 Reviews on this Page is a bit overrated. First of all the Animation is really mind-blowing and a completly new Style. This is incredible and i hope more movies risk something in this area. The Movie felt like reading an actual Comic Book which was surprsingly fun. The Soundtrack helped the Movie to create Emotions and felt cool because it fits in our Time. The Story was overall not bad, but nothing great happend. As i said earlier, it felt like a cinematic Comic Book and this also means that the Story was nothing more than this. Therefore it was a way better story than average with a lot of Humor and Action. but nothing that will be remembered long.
So Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse was a very good Movie with a solid Story. You should definitly check it out if you are interested in the Animation Style or you are a Fan of the Comic Books. Good job Marvel, try out more things and you will go in the right direction. 7/10",

Every single Spider-Man movie was amazing, but this one is my second favorite (No Way Home being first). This movie was just so unique in so many ways. Firstly, the plot was amazingly creative.

I'm at a loss of words on how to even sum up what I just saw right now. Pretty much it's everything you've ever wanted in a superhero and animated film and nothing like you've ever seen in your life. I was sad when it ended and I had to go back to real life. :( If only we had a Spiderman to defeat our own CERN and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Yes this movie was solidly based around that idea. Not trying to be a tin hat here, but look at the obvious. There's a reason keep seeing similar appearances in our favorite movies/shows (IE: Ant Man 2, Stranger Things).",
648,7 April 2020,nawshadlabib-35414,5, A flawed movie ..good visuals with many plot holes,A movie can have plot holes. But..this movie has many. Like morales' uncle worked under the command of the VILLAIN Kingpin. Kingpin killed spiderman. And he is okay with his uncle. Just like that. The emotions didn't add up. The animation is gorgeous.except for the movements of the characters. But it's not all bad. I kinda liked the spidermans from all the other dimensions. The villan's base is not strong. This movie is really over hyped. I don't know what happened with oscars. But the oscars' weirdness have become a standard issue now.,

651,1 March 2019,BlizzyFoxTF,9, An animation masterpiece of the 2010s,"I'm only 19, but I remember watching the first 2002 Spider-Man movie with Tobey Maguire and watching the cartoon from the 90s when I was a kid. I was also an avid Spider-Man comic book reader, I had a box with literally hundreds of comic books on the character. All of this ignited a passion in me. Spider-Man was more than just a character in a book or movie. If I felt sad I went to Spider-Man, if I was bored I went to Spider-Man, if I was angry I used Spider-Man to calm myself down.
This movie takes that love for the character and strengthens it. Everything from the story, the animation, the soundtrack, and the spider-people and villains are done to perfection. Watching this movie made me tear up because I felt like a 7 year old kid again, staying up past my bedtime to read just one more comic or watch one more episode of the cartoon.
My review doesn't do this movie justice, just please go watch it.",
652,28 December 2018,ratpackaustin,10, This is why I love Spider-Man,"This is, hands down, the greatest animated movie ever made, the best Spiderman movie ever made and one of the best, if not the best, Marvel movies ever made. First off, the animation is fantastic. At first, I didnt like it because it looked too choppy and disorienting. That was before i realized what their goal with the animation was: to make a comic book come to life, and it is AWESOME. I loved how there would be words following the sound effects like BOOM, PAW or SNAP; that was awesome. Lets talk performances. Shameik Moore gave the performance of his career as Miles Morales; he was extremely funny and likeable, and his voice was so fitting for a character like Miles. Jake Johnson as Peter Parker was equally as fantastic; he was extremely funny and charismatic, and he gave a new approach to the iconic character, which i thought was great. Everyone else (hailee steinfeld, mahershala ali, nicholas cage, etc) did a fantastic job in their roles. The action was very well-done; it was fast-paced, satisfying to watch and waa just fun. Also, the soundtrack was fantastic, and not just the soundtrack with sunflower, whats up danger and all the other great songs, but the score was great too. There waa not a single dull moment in this movie. I cant find anything to criticize. This film gets an ""A+"".",

656,25 December 2018,sushantahim,10, The best SPIDER-MAN MOVIE ever!!!!!!!!,"This movie would definitely have Stan Lee's approval. When I saw the ad that would release this movie, I wasn't very excited, I thought it would be just another Spiderman movie, but with another character used to enhance Peter's image, I confess I was totally wrong, it's a movie about Miles Morales and his trajectory to become Spiderman, which was something wonderful, I have to start talking about the soundtracks, at the beginning of the film, it plays the song ""Sunflower"" from the Post Malone, and it makes the film earn a point with me, because it fit perfectly at the moment, as much as I think the best song in the movie, I confess that the scene with Miles taking the leap of faith while playing ""What's up danger"" is the best in the movie, and I also say that the tracks are used in building the scene in a perfect way. Let's not forget to mention the animation in the movie, which is just PERFECT, the style applied in homage to the comics was simply the best animation I've ever seen, and all the scenes are done with love, the animated battle scenes are better than many movies choreographed, which makes the level go up a lot. We have to close talking about the characters in the movie, many think some characters (such as Peni Parker and Peter Porker) poorly developed and even boring, but I disagree, these two characters mentioned may even be worse than the rest, but they are very good, and they all teach Miles something, however, i have to say i'm spiderman noir fanboy in this movie (because he's my favorite spider), he could have more screen space because his voice acting (at least in the Brazilian version) is wonderful, his dark line and with only two colors works very well, and the battle scene at Aunt May's house with him using the powers is very good. I'll make honorable mentions to two characters I haven't mentioned here: - Peter B. Parker - Gwen Stacy It would take a long time to write about both of them, but I assure you they are the best characters in the movie. That's it, sorry if it's poorly written, because I'm Brazilian and I'm using the translator to write, until next time.",
657,27 November 2021,fabipaularossi,10, the BEST Spiderman Movie,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a heart-warming film for all the family to see. I admit the film can get upsetting in some places, like when Uncle Aaron dies or Miles can't talk to his Dad because he's wrapped up in a chair. It's sad but exciting. When your not crying your gripping to your seat or clutching your friend next to you or even imagining you are Miles Morales. I mean the animation in this film is really cool and not just the same old boring cartoon s**t you see in Disney Princess movies. No, this is gold to one's eye. I'd even say that Spider-Man: Homecoming is trash compared to this. Yeah, come and get me MCU! The only thing I'd like to say is go and enjoy this film as it is quite hard to dislike.",

This film breaks barriers not only with people of color but does it in a culturally grounded way, with style for dayz, innovative combinations of genres, simultaneously paying homage to the mythology as well as reinventing it with funny and fresh takes.

The writing of the movie is very much similar with any Marvel movie, you'll find same story telling with plot twists and turns which you've seen in Spider-Man Homecoming and Far from Home. The movie attempts the diversification within Spider-Man's character including gender and color which might be little difficult to digest and may be that is why instead of a feature film Marvel with Sony played safely to bring it into the animation so that extra leverage can be taken with respect to creative liberties and they did it successfully as the movie already got praises from masses and critiques equally also the film got Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film.

I highly highly recommend you watch it in 3D if you can. The comedy and voice acting is on point, using its highly stylised animation to its advantage. The characters are all great especially miles and peter, although the others all have their own time to shine. This film is brilliant with great themes and messages with the best Stan Lee cameo and end credit scene. The only reason I give it a 9 and not a 10, is a small few gripes that I was a bit confused in how characters got to certain things places and a certain character development that wasn't really explained, as well as Kingpin not getting as much development as I would of liked.

A fun, though not original, story leads all the various Spider characters together in a fun ride through Marvel lore. Was also very pleased with the adult overtones to the story while keeping it an animation movie for kids, which so many new cartoon movies do so well these days. In the end, while I may still believe that Peter Parker is the Spiderman, I now have a better understanding and appreciation of Morales and the other variations of Spiderman and their place in the Marvel Universe.

A beautifully written script went hand-in-hand with the characters and their personalities producing some great laughs and moments that pulled at you.

The whole movie using a unique style, feeling the audiences are reading a comic book, feeling like those old comic book but because of the printer error, everything looks a little bit obscure. Feeling like that the director and producers bring the comic book s back to life and in 3D.
The speed of this movie is so good. A new kid got bite by the spider and from an idiot to a master is the base line of this story. And then we give him the family line. Father issue, best friend is his uncle who we all know will die. How to fix the family problem is another line. Then writers give him the third one, bad guy Fisk, other Spider-Man as his teachers, I would call this the motive line, why he want to become a real Spider-Man.
Although, 6 Spider-Man in this movie, Miles Morales is the absolute protagonist. Also could say it's such a pity that the movie did not using too much part to talk about other Spider-Man. But luckily it did not, otherwise this movie gonna lose its focus. See, 6 charming, unique, special Spider-Man but still cannot let other steal Miles's thunder.

However the film is immensely entertaining and hilarious. My wife and I watched this with huge grins on our faces. The first hour is superior as we meet Miles and watch him become Spider-Man. It also has the best Spiderman ( the one from Miles own World ). Unfortunately it goes off the rails in the climactic altered reality battle where the animators went haywire loco. It also loses points for the hunchbacked and unnaturally strong Kingpin. The manga and pig Spidermen were also stupid. But just about everything else is spectacular and spot on. Great twist from one of the villains and some shocking deaths. I'd love to see a movie with the first Spider-Man and his ( Alfred ) Aunt May.

Adults playing cartoon characters almost never works on the big screen, animation, however, frees cartoon characters to do things much easier in the area of special effects than when adults are trying to be superheroes.

796,16 August 2021,gianmarcoronconi,10, Wondeful,"'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is a surprisingly mature, yet constantly entertaining animation that never loses its sense of fun despite the serious themes that it explores. At its core, the film is an origin story that hits all the beats that we have come to expect from films of its kind, however these elements are fused with the completely new 'multiverse' aspects and this ensures that the generic elements of the narrative don't prove to be much of a problem. The excellent character development also helps to keep the film fresh. While a few of the 'Spider-People' aren't really fleshed out further than their basic character traits, the majority of core characters have believable arcs that allow us to care for them. Peter B. Parker was a surprisingly nuanced character and his Spider-Man story is probably the most realistic one that we have ever seen on the big screen. Although it initially seemed distracting and some of the shots looked like you were watching the 3D version without the glasses, the animation style was overall excellent and really brought the comic book aesthetic to life, in a way that has never been seen before. The character design was also generally good, except from Kingpin's as he looked way too big and didn't really fit with the aesthetic style of the rest of the characters. Unlike a lot of recent superhero flicks, the film knows when to use humour and when to be serious, never confusing the two, allowing for both laugh-out loud comedic moments and genuinely tense and exciting action sequences. Overall, 'Into the Spider-Verse' is a fantastic film that knows exactly what it wants to be, and will appeal to children and adults alike thanks to its humour, action, and fleshed-out narrative. 8/10",
797,28 December 2018,domtaylor,9, The best animated film of the year.,"Review:
When I heard they were making an animated version of Spider-Man for the big screen, I wasn't overly excited, but after watching a couple of trailers, I saw that they really took a chance with the unique style and concept of the film. It still didn't make me want to pay to see it on the big screen, so I waited for it to be released on Blu-ray, and I must admit, it was a great movie. The whole black Spider-Man concept was brilliantly put together, and I liked the family element throughout the film. The various Spider-Men & Women were great but it did take me some time to get used to the animation, which was done just like a comic book. The mannerisms and facial expressions of Miles Morales were brilliant, and the kingpin looked nuts but it really is the storyline which I have to give top marks. It did get a bit confusing when it came to the quantum leap concept because they seemed to be flying in and out of time, but apart from that, I really did enjoy it. The movie is about a teenager called Miles Morales, who struggles to live up to the expectations of his father, police officer Jefferson Davis, who sees Spider-Man as a menace. Miles changes to a boarding school, but he sneaks out and goes to his Uncle Aaron Davis house. When he takes Miles to an abandoned subway station to paint graffiti, Miles is bitten by a radioactive spider and gains spider-like abilities. Miles returns to the station to search for the spider and discovers a particle accelerator called ""The Super-Collider"" built by Wilson Fisk. Fisk hopes to access parallel universes to find alternative versions of his deceased wife and son, who died in a car crash after they found Fisk trying to kill Spider-Man. Spider-Man tried to disable the collider while fighting Fisk's enforcers, Green Goblin and Prowler. Spider-Man saves Miles and senses that they are alike. Green Goblin shoves Spider-Man into the collider, causing an explosion that kills Green Goblin. Wounded, Spider-Man gives Miles a USB drive to disable the accelerator and warns that the machine could destroy the city if activated. Miles watches in horror as Fisk kills Spider-Man, and flees from Prowler. Miles damages the hard drive whilst trying out his newfound abilities. At Spider-Man's grave, Miles meets Peter B. Parker, an older and worn down version of Spider-Man from another dimension. Upon meeting Peter, Miles inadvertently discovers a power to emit a bio-electric pulse to disable his victim. Peter reluctantly agrees to train Miles in exchange for help stealing data to create a new drive. In Fisk's research facility, Miles discovers he has the power to turn invisible. They are confronted by chief scientist Olivia Octavius, who reveals that Peter will die due to cellular decay if he stays longer in their dimension after taking DNA samples from Peter. Miles and Peter are rescued by Gwen Stacy, Spider-Woman from another dimension. They find Peter's aunt, May Parker, who is sheltering more heroes from other dimensions. Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Ham and Peni Parker are also deteriorating. Miles offers to disable the collider so the others can return home, but the heroes tell him he lacks experience. Miles retreats to Aaron's home, where he discovers that Aaron is the Prowler. He returns to May's house, where Peni has completed the drive, however, he is followed by Fisk, Prowler, Octavius, Scorpion and Tombstone, leading to a brawl. Miles flees, but is captured by Prowler and unmasks himself. Unwilling to kill Miles, Aaron is shot by Fisk. Miles flees with Aaron, but Aaron dies of his injuries. Jefferson sees Miles mourning over Aaron and concludes that Spider-Man killed him. The heroes regroup with Miles in his dorm. peter restrains Miles with his webs to ensure his safety before heading out with the heroes, choosing to sacrifice himself by staying behind and deactivating the collider. Miles masters his powers and goes to Aunt May's, where he gains web shooters and repairs Peter's suit. He joins the heroes and helps them defeat Fisk's enforcers before activating the USB drive and sending them home. Fisk and Miles fight throughout the collider and Miles paralyses Fisk with his venom blast and throws him at the kill switch, destroying the collider. Fisk and his enforcers are arrested and Jefferson recognises Spider-Man as a hero. Back in their home dimensions, the heroes return to their lives. Peter prepares to fix his relationship with Mary Jane, and Gwen finds a way to connect Miles across dimensions. It's definitely not a straight forward plot, but it makes more sense when you're watching it. The directors tried their utmost to stay close to the comics, which is why it was popular with the die-hard fans. Personally, I haven't read any of the comics but I still found the movie entertaining, and completely different from any of the movies. It wasn't made with young kids in mind, which is why it didn't smash the box office, and it's ""Street"" concept isn't for everyone, but there are many different elements that will satisfy all ages. I just hope that they carry on this animated franchise because it's one of the best Spider-Man adaptations that I have seen to date. Surprisingly Enjoyable!",

822,29 July 2019,jeshelle,5, Not the greatest,"Everyone knows the story of Spider-Man and ITSV touches upon it briefly but then moved away from it which is a nice fresh take for a ""re-boot"" of the Spider-Man franchise.",
823,12 October 2019,Kingslaay,8, An exciting spin,"Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are known for their penchant for irreverent comedy; 21 Jump Street and The Lego Movie immediately pop to mind with a grin. Here the talented pair, along with Avi Arad and Peter Ramsey, turn their hand to a beloved Marvel item who is no stranger to a reboot; Spider-Man. But, this time we're not being subjected to yet another Uncle Ben death scene; Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse tells the origin story of another Spidey, plucky teen, Miles Morales (an energetic Shameik Moore) as he grapples with the infamous Kingpin (Liev Schreiber), helped by a number of inter-dimensional ""Spider-people""... including a washed-up, cynical Peter Parker (voiced with a nonchalant drawl by Jake Johnson). We watch as Miles grapples with finding his feet after an unfortunate interaction with a radioactive arachnid, in a hearty and humorous adventure, that feels distinctly Lord and Miller.
Into the Spider-Verse is a noticeably different adaptation of the friendly neighbourhood superhero; from the outset, the film cheekily satirises the incessant rebooting of its character (a flashback to a certain Spider-Man 3 moment gives perhaps the biggest laugh). Plenty of fun is poked out of comic-book movie tropes too; this doesn't change the fact however that, plot-wise, Into the Spider-Verse has little to offer in terms of originality, its narrative as predictable as a Saturday morning TV cartoon.
The film almost makes this redundant, however, through a stylish and confident execution, that feels fresh. Lord and Rodney Rothman's script is full of wry humour, quick-witted, yet full of heart and honesty. Miles Morales is also a more fleshed out lead than we are used to from Marvel (despite a slightly easy resolution to his arc) and his band of misfits, whilst largely one-note, are fun enough to carry the film with ease. Brian Tyree Henry and Mahershala Ali are unfeigned as Miles' father and uncle respectively and Jake Johnson is simply brilliant in an incarnation of Peter Parker hitherto undreamt of. An antagonist in the form of Kingpin is more disappointing, a forced motivation leaving him uninteresting and decidedly by-the-numbers. The movie leaves us little time to think on its faults though; it takes a relentless, yet natural, pace through riveting action sequences and comedic montages, with the ease of a web swing.
Into the Spider-Verse's greatest strength, however, is its design. The animation is unique and aesthetic, delightfully reminiscent of an old-school comic strip. The film feels like a very real homage to its source material, the comic in comic book movie always coming first. Into the Spider-Verse won't be remembered for breaking ground in plot and character, but its design alone is enough to make you want to go back for more.
Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have assembled a fun and frenetic film which, whilst standard on paper, is executed with artistry and flair. An incarnation of the world's favourite superhero surely to be remembered.",

836,31 January 2019,owenddavis,10, Best Translation of a Comic Book Story to a Motion Picture,"Spider-Man: Into The Spider-verse managed to effectively mix pathos with humour. For Miles, being bitten by a radioactive spider doesn't automatically turn him into an expert superhero. He has to learn how to use his new powers. For the majority of the film he doesn't even know what powers he has. In addition he also has some difficult things going on at home. His father, Jefferson Davis, has great expectations for him, which is a level Miles doesn't know that he can meet. He has a closer relationship with his uncle Aaron. Miles' story was very interesting and that more than anything else kept one engaged in the plot. The majority of the humour came from the various iterations of Spider-Man. For me Spider-Man/Peter B Parker was more hilarious. The others had their moments of laughs, but none were as funny as the original Spider-Man. As he also has his own little subplot going on. The one hero I wasn't too pleased about was Spider-Ham/Peter Porker. The character went too far into the weirdness. I also thought the villain - Kingpin could've been fleshed out a bit more. He didn't get much screen time; and we didn't learn enough about his back story or motivations beyond the basic reason for his creating the particle accelerator. The most appealing thing about this movie is the unique animation. It's unlike anything we've ever seen before before; it's very impressive. But it's a style that not very enjoyable to watch after a certain amount of time. One of the major frustrations was how sometimes the backgrounds would go fuzzy, to the extent that it made things visually confusing especially during chase sequences. That said, the use of speech bubbles and text for sounds, the kind of which you'd see in a comic, worked very well.",

They even adress and implement stuff that is known from the spider-verse I did really not remember. Here's my two issues with this film though. I was really looking forward to it, mostly hoping for a game-changer in art within the whole franchise.
The stop-motion-trick while doing the whole movie may be a bold animation choice, but turns out to make the whole thing clunky and I cannot figure out why they went for a lower framerate than regular animated movies. To me it just feels off and makes it hard to watch. What brings me to the second issue. I happen to feel motion sickness in certain games that appear to have head bobbling and certain light and brightness effects. So far I couldn't figure out the reason but this movie manages to do the same to me. I had to stop watching 1 hour in due to actually feeling sick just watching a damn movie.
Lot's of people like it. give it a try. I cannot recommend due to motion sickness issues. A clear no to the lower framerate. It was an artistic choice but I clearly don't see the point except for the saving money part. It is creative, sure, but I cannot watch it...",

An animated Spider-verse movie featuring Miles Morales along with other Spider-persons from throughout the multiverse team up to stop a threat that could destroy every parallel reality. There has been a lot of buzz around this film even mentions of an Oscar nomination for best picture not as an animated feature but for the big one. I quite liked the movie but I didn't walk away agreeing with the Oscar talk surrounding this film. Some have even said this may perhaps be the best Spider-Man film ever made and I don't know that I agree with that either.
I am glad that the Miles Morales character is finally getting his time in the spotlight. There have been a contingent of fans calling for a live action film featuring the character but I still think we're a few years away from that happening. Shameik Moore gave one hell of a performance as Miles in fact I was impressed by the voice performances of the entire cast. I was especially impressed by Jake Johnson's performance as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. There were some really great emotional beats and moments in the film especially between Miles and his dad as well as Miles with his uncle.
Even though I did enjoy the film it didn't wow me as I had been expecting it to. Maybe this film was never going to live up to the hype for me but I did enjoy it. One reviewer said this was his favorite comic book film of the year again I would have to disagree for my money it would have to be Aquaman.
The first act dragged a bit for me and the pacing felt a bit off. By the start of the second act onwards things really started to pick up and the story seemed to flow a bit smoother as well. I love the fact that Spider-Ham of all characters was included in this film as his character added a lot of levity to the film that had a couple of dark moments in it but tonally overall I wouldn't call the tone dark it was mostly fun and very emotional.
Stan Lee's cameo got me a bit choked up especially considering the context of the scene in which he was in. I won't spoil it for you here but it was a really beautiful moment. Kingpin is the main big bad in the film but a couple of other notable villains turn up as well but you'll have to see the film to find out who they are.
Lily Tomlin as Aunt May was a delight she did such a great job with the character. Her Aunt May is a very different version than one we've seen before on screen which added a lot more dimension and importance to the character. I definitely would recommend this film if you're a fan of any versions of the versions of Spider-Man and if you stick around for the post credit scene another Spidey yet to be seen on screen makes a cameo.",

Also, unlike most - the film's message harks back to what originally made superheroes such as Spiderman loved in the first place, as if someone has finally paid attention; their relatability - anyone & everyone has the ability to be super if they choose to be - all it takes is ""a leap of faith"", as the film describes.

When he's consumed by the black symbiote in the Raimi trilogy's climax, that results in an unmentionable scene (even this iteration acknowledges this embarrassment). But isn't that just a perfect encapsulation of Maguire's Parker? He's not only the underdog, he's the furthest thing from cool.

868,4 June 2019,kz917-1,9, Surprisingly Good!,"Not really a marvel nor a spider-man fan so I guess maybe those who know more did enjoy this movie better. It was much different than what I've expected. The animation was new to me, kind of like comics style which is weird but entertaining at the same time. Didn't like the humor though, I think it was a bit over re-used and the story lack a little bit of depth and emotion. Soundtrack was great, maybe it's best quality out of all. So overall, I think it's good but I've seen better super hero movies.",
869,19 December 2021,miguelcastrogusa,9, Tear Jerking Spideman Movie,"Wow. This was a feat on multiple levels.
(1) The animation style - I've never seen anything like it. While it takes a bit getting used to, the animation makes you feel like you're reading a comic book.
(2) The story - My biggest concern going in was how the filmmakers would explain the concept of multiple parallel universes to audiences without bogging down the plot. Somehow...they did it
(3) Honoring Spider-Man - despite none of the spider-people being the Peter Parker shown in other films, there was an element to each character that made one feel that they were, indeed a Spider-person. The cameos and references to Spider-Man canon made the film especially fun for longtime fans.
(4) A Good Movie - It's a refreshing take on not only Spider-Man, but the superhero genre as a whole. It's got comedy, drama, action and heart.",

It's an origin story and a multiverse travelling adventure all in one. Youngster Miles Morales is involved in an incident which leaves him with spidey superpowers; he's also witness to an incident which sees Peter Parker being murdered at the hands of King Pin. Coincidental fallout also causes a multiversal rift which somehow pulls various multiverses spider-people into the same existence. Running at just over an hour and half this film is well equipped to keep its audience gripped and entertained. It'll be something that new audiences, as well as people well versed in Spiderman can come to. It looks aesthetically good and mixes various animation styles too.

A wonderfully imaginative and creative blast that harnasses the unique possibilities of animation and the best of the superhero genre with wit and intelligence to produce something new and different. Unlike many new and different pieces of art, however, it's also warm and inviting. Brilliantly animated, acted, and directed, it has uplifting ideas about diversity and inspiration without being too sentimental or 'life lesson' of the worse type.

One negative was that some moments really shouldn't of had rap music over them as it just killed the mood.

When I started watching it, I thought there wasn't enough time for all the superheroes to have defining moments and WOW to my surprise every spider-character/person was given enough time for you to fall in love with. The main villain also isn't one directional but rather complicated; had a reason for the collider and also a reason to hate all Spider-People. Man the animation was superb- great visuals, fighting styles were spectacular ( cuz every spidey character had his/her unique fighting style) , the jokes were on point and to top it of the movie had HEART and all this were culminated in less than two hours, I give this movie a 10 cuz they delivered the pinnacle of what a super hero origin story should be, no more no less.

899,26 December 2021,ElizabethM_Badpwnies,10, A perfect spiderman movie,"Amazing. Spectacular. Sensational. Superior. These words have all been used to describe the character of Spider-Man. They can all ALSO be used to describe 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse'. The film follows young Miles Morales who, after being bitten by a radioactive spider (sound familiar?), starts on his thrilling journey to becoming the new Spider-Man! Along the way he encounters several alternate, dimension-displaced versions of Spidey. These Spider-People include an older, jaded Peter Parker, Spider-Gwen, Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Ham (Yes, he's a pig), and Peni Parker (along with her biomechanical suit called SP//dr). The story is uplifting, inspiring, and hilarious, with the message that ""Anyone can wear the mask"". The animation style is unlike anything I've ever seen before. The film looks like a comic book come to life, and it was captivating and mesmerizing to watch. It really is a ""comic book movie""! I left the theater feeling like I had just witnessed something truly special. The cast and characters were all FANTASTIC, but my favorites were Spider-Ham and Spider-Gwen. The villains were all menacing and intimidating, which I feel is rare in an animated film. The music was also incredible and complimented the film PERFECTLY. In conclusion, 'Into the Spider-Verse' is an emotional story about believing in yourself and becoming who you were meant to be, regardless of any obstacles that may be in your way. It doesn't matter who you are or where you come from...you can be a hero. YOU could wear the mask. It is not only the best Spider-Man movie thus far, it's my new favorite animated film and one of the greatest comic book movie's of all-time.",

That's just what the story, premise, characters, sound, art and animation and many other things within this movie were like. They were okay, sure, but nothing great. They weren't progressive. They weren't unique. They weren't creative. It was a movie that existed alongside Black Panther which I think did better in some ways. It really didn't need to happen but at the same time it was decent enough that I might give the sequel a chance if it ever comes out.

The themes of Self Identity and where we can differentiate Him with the other Spider-Men is heart of the film as it establishes this Miles as his own self, rather than another Peter clone in the Ultimate/Prime Universe(Of the Comics). The Comedic Relief didn't feel far off Noir portrayed by Nic Cage is a highlight, Peter Porker is a cartoon character what you'd expect and Peni Parker with Sp//dr (i prefer the Evangalion design of the original.) The Animation superb, The score and Soundtrack ultimately fitting (although some complain about the use of Scared in the Dark and yes it did feel off, but it didn't bother me that much.

As they say: with great love for comic-book origins, comes a great Spider-Man movie. Or somewhere along those lines. Anyhow, the point is, in this criminally undervalued gem of an animation, we can plainly see an undisguised appreciation for the comics and the classic components that comprise the world of Spider-Man. Or worlds. It's no secret that Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, while honing in on the heroic progression of alternate Spider-Man Miles Morales, brings together a number of universes, in which exist different versions of all the characters present in the one we know. Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the brains behind The LEGO Movie and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, have here worked with the three directors (quite unusual in itself) to craft a very unique and unequivocally original take on popular stories stemming from late creators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko (who are saluted by a special credit at the end of the film), tied together by a ground-breaking animation style which hearkens back powerfully to the comic books from where it originated.",

I wasn't overwhelmed but everything about this one was so well done. the jokes were not actually funny but there was no cringe factor like most of the MCU movies. and instead of adding up different spidermans together the creators managed to put all those internet memes and pop culture into great use. they pulled off the (ready player one) style of using real life references and they added their own touch of making it relatable to the spider verse and even emotional at times. overall the movie is really entertaining and a new take on the spiderman stories without all the already known boring stuff. totally recommended.",

This movie has a lot great and special things like these. Also I appreciate it for paying respect to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko at the and of the movie. RIP legends... But this movie is not so laughing at all. It hasnt so many amazing jokes. And I think it is a bit overrated because lots of people say it is better than any Marvel movie so far but this is an idea which is beyond this movie. It is not because it hasnt a so intense villian or villian team. These characters are a bit recessive in story. Finally, I have to say something.

924,28 December 2018,rockstarzz05-97-745174,10," No word's, AMAZING!","When I first saw this movie announced, I was skeptical. And by skeptical I mean I didn't care at all and forgot about it. But boy was I wrong. I love spidey but don't really care about the MCU, and this sure is a treat for any Spider-Man fan. Firstly, and most importantly, this movie has absolutely some of the finest, most impressive visuals I have ever seen in an animated film. There are tons of different art styles on display and it's a barrage of swirling color and sharp animation work. The character design is flawless - from the various spider-people to the excellent Doc Ock (who's a woman), Kingpin, and my personal favorite, the prowler. Speaking of The Prowler, who is by far the best character in the film, the scenes he's in are mostly intense, large scale chase scenes (there's an excellent homage to The Dark Knight when he gets on his motorcycle) and he is an intimidating and genuinely menacing character (although so is this Kingpin).
Also speaking of Prowler, the score and soundtrack to this movie are excellent. You've probably heard the soundtrack, consisting of great rap songs by some of the biggest names in the game right now. But the score is the unsung hero, specifically the sound design used for Prowler's scenes. Here, a sampled elephant call is warped and twisted into a ridiculously cool and terrifying sound that plays whenever Prowler is near. It's amazing at all other parts too, don't get me wrong, this is just the clear highlight.
The plot is immediately engrossing, incredibly emotional, and very, very well written, from the screenplay to the clever dialogue. I'm a huge horror movie fan who almost exclusively watches horror movies, but this movie is just absolutely stunning. My ONLY complaint is that I wish Prowler got more screen time.",

931,15 December 2018,vinothdharma,9, Amazing movie,As a life long superhero comic book fan I am sick to death of superhero comic book movies. But this was a nice exception. The visuals are absolutely amazing. But at times the movie felt way jerkier than being animated on twos. For the sequel it would be interesting if they went for broke with digital projection and animation on ones with 60 fps for flawless fluidity. Although I liked the movie it felt a little long. 100 minutes would have been perfect.,

The story was easy to follow for those paying attention, and certainly capable of maintaining the interest of viewers of all ages. The humor was spot on. The animation had an insane amount of attention to detail, but also somehow felt a little unpolished even in the scenes that didn't intentionally have the off-color effect, but I think that's more of a personal issue because I loved every other aspect of it. My only real complaint was that I didn't feel a strong emotional connection to any character at the climax, though I was certainly entertained throughout.",

This movie rocks. Plain and simple. I have never seen animation like this before ever. Clearly the people behind this amazing movie are geniuses. Before the movie even starts we are introduced to the characters and get to know their story. How many movies with real characters fail to do this? A LOT!
The movie hums along like a fine-tuned sports car and after some sequences I had to pick my jaw off the floor.
What an incredible movie and why it's not up for best picture is beyond words. The sheer amount of people involved (ending credits) clearly shows this movie was made with love and Stan (not sure if he saw it before he passed) would be super proud. 2 hours of mayhem I will gladly repeat soon.",

939,6 June 2019,funtasticfour,8, An excellent Spiderman cartoon movie!,The movie itself is a meme that tries to meme the audience with even more Spider-Man memes. And it succeeds at exactly that.,
940,19 March 2019,bhernandez2216,10, Into the Spider-Verse,"Despite being touted as a Lord/Miller return project, with what seems to be little of their actual involvement, the real star is the incredible editing and overload of visual styles and the completely relatable and believable (but not forced) characterisation of mixed-race star of Miles Morales.
Into the Spider-Verse is (obviously) a hilarious, creative, exciting, surprising and engaging elseworld fusion and re-invention of Spider-Man, and while they had to go animated to give a mixed-race Spider-Man his due (and some strong, feminine, and different female characters as well), it may have completely done Morales justice. Free of the shackles of Raimi's live-action post-9/11 America-pandering version of Spider-Man, Spider-Verse is allowed to make something clever out of the whole time-paradox-rebootquel trend popularised by 2009's Star Trek - except here it's deftly handled, gentle and most of all, fun; rife for easter eggs and appropriate fan-service; I for one, actually cheered, when I saw the videogame costume in the lair, and the bubbles and comic styles all just gel.
The voice cast is superb, for this reason: they are all great actors but the characters felt entirely like characters, and unlike something from Dreamworks where the characterisations hinge entirely on you recognising the actor's star power, in Spider-Verse I never felt the need to it half way through, I just felt how real these people were. My girlfriend, at the tease of the other Spider-People, said, with a real surprise and light in her eyes: ""There's a female Spider-Man??!!"" and I realised that I took for granted that I already knew who Spider-Gwen was, and also how powerful it was to see her, and how little I cared whether the Spider-Person was in fact a man or not. In-fact I'd kill to see a live-action Spider-Woman film.
So this film is truly one for fans and one for noobs, and that's rare, I think my partner would have loved it even without me pointing out that I owned the Spider-Noir comic book and without pointing out that, yes, Wilson Fisk is that big in the comics (sometimes), or a myriad of little things that I don't know how I know.
More impactful than anything for me though was that the final fight, when he's all 'alone', was the most tense end fight in the usually predictable, numbing and inevitable superhero final fights. Whereas by the end of most superhero films, the hero has built himself up to win, in Verse, Miles has only just got himself ready to start, in a film that starts with the actual killing of a universe's Spider-Man, you really don't know what it can do, and with a Miles Morales who has only just found himself, and who's an actual kid instead of a thirty-something-year old actor playing a kid, it's nail-biting stuff.
I read an article about how the Spider-Man from the start is the idealised version of Spider-Man, the brand version; perfect, the whole of everything, unrealistic, unreachable. And where that Spider-Man could do it all, it takes the team of Spider-People from different universes, each with their different skills to come together and support each other. More pointedly, The Peter B Parker (B for Ben?) is the hero we can be, he's flawed, he has the same problems as we do, he's neither immaculate, nor immune to the trappings of life, he's the flawed hero, and he's from the main Marvel universe. 'Our' universe. I think that's quite powerful, and certainly a bold decision and one we may never see in a Spider-Man film ever again.",

943,11 January 2019,reinhardtkuechl,10, Spider-Man into the spider verse,"The visuals are pretty bad-ass, it shows hard work by the people behind the film. Not just that, the film has heart. The problem with having too many characters in a single film is a loss of character depth, but it was nicely done in this film, you start to feel for the characters, even for the robot taken straight out of anime. The only fault, and I really had to look for one, was not lending more time to the chemistry between Gwen and Miles; when I say that, I don't mean it wasn't done well, but that I'd have loved to see more of it, I found it cool. Unlike other romance between superheroes that feel forced and have 2nd rated importance, the relationship between Gwen and Miles shone. I'm definitely into the multiverse so much so that the Tom Holland's version (due for a second film) is just not appealing anymore- in light of the trailer for ""far from home"".

954,5 January 2019,bsoterion,9, I stayed awake and my kids loved it...,"Sony's latest Spidey outing is a vibrantly colourful and fast paced comic book love letter to the amazing superhero and a fitting tribute to the late great Stan Lee. This time we focus on Miles Morales; the Spider-Man of this particular reality who due to a universe shattering machine being used by some classic Marvel villains, comes into touch with other dimensions and indeed other Spider-People including Spider-Gwen, Spider-Noir (Nicolas Cage) and Spider-Ham (my personal favourite!) I really enjoyed this one for the most part! As much of a Spidey fan as I am and as visually inventive as it is, the animation did prove to be more of a distraction for me from an emotional entrance point into the story and the characters which is a shame (The intentionally 3D aesthetic on the background while watching the 2D version does make you feel like you've walked into the wrong screening) but it is simultaneously its strong point in terms of spectacle; different animation styles mixing together is quite lovely to watch and it comes masterfully together in the exciting final showdown sequence which is worth seeing on the biggest screen possible!

I'm also an avid animation fanatic, and even animate some myself. To see so many styles and artistic designs fused together in a seamless, comic book way is breathtaking. I wasn't expecting so much from this movie, I honestly wasn't even excited to see it.

965,20 March 2019,adityak-91942,10, No words to Say!!,"Last year, I said that ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" was the best Spider-Man movie ever. I was wrong. This is! It has the perfect amount of action, drama, and comedy. Allegedly, the directors, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, were fired from the Han Solo movie because their vision was ""too comedic."" This movie proves they can balance drama and comedy perfectly, and I'm hoping this film opens the floodgates for them with other studios wanting to hire them. The animation took some getting used too as it is computer-animated, but meant to look like a comic book not quite completely CGI, but not quite completely hand-drawn either. What was clever about this very unique animation style was in certain close-up shots you could see the little dots that you would see in the pages of a comic book if you zoomed in with a magnifying glass. This movie already blew my mind, but if it had come out when I was 6, it would have blown my mind even more so. This is the Spider-Man movie I would have wanted as a kid, and I can't help but feel jealous of kids today who are my age when the original Spider-Man movie came out in 2002. The backstories for the various Spider-people are told very well, and even if you're not familiar with all the various iterations of the character, you still don't feel lost. (and this movie barely scratches the surface of the Spider-Man lore. There are still many, many, versions of Spider-Man that can be touched on, and I look forward to seeing them in the sequel). This is perfect for kids and adults! If this is not nominated for an Oscar next year, something is wrong with the Academy. There was absolute nothing about this movie to complain about!

I felt sorry for the gangster who produced the fantastic machine: he loved his wife and child. Sometimes death is death. The saving grace is that we miss the dead and remember them. as in Coco. Also a fantastic animation. So, on that basis, the cartoon worked. Marvel is over the top. I loved Peter Parker as paunchy. His wife missed him because he dove into his rescue work. A death of a marriage, each rescue escapade was another nail in the coffin. The visual jokes were good. The ""heart"" was there. Stan Lee was there as usual. We miss him, but his ""heart"" lives on. A bit much for the preschoolers. Cool for the older ones. Narrative lacking cohesiveness for the retired. Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" confused me at the time.

There are so many characters, so much emotion and so many quick fire gags both in the script and on the screen that a re-watch is surely a must to help put things into perspective. At first glance however not enough time was spent on any one plot line or device in order to give it the weight that the emotional stakes needed them to have - for example the primary villain's motivation, Jake Johnson's ageing Spiderman's love life, and particularly Miles Morales complex family problems, control of his powers, and acceptance of his role in the larger world. Slyly aware of its place within the diversifying superhero market, Spider-verse is reverent to the history of the character, both on-screen and off.

The movie has a simple story line where multiple, parallel universes collide and the writers take good use of this by writing enthralling character arcs which give out a simple message, 'That person who helps others simply because it should or must be done, and because it is the right thing to do, is indeed without a doubt, a real superhero.'
The great aspect of this film is how it builds an emotional relationship with very less screen time. For example, the protagonist Miles and his Uncle Aaron hardly share a few scenes together yet one can understand the emotions they share for each other with just a single scene. So is the relationship of Peni Parker and her father, they don't even talk to each other but still, the emotions are justified.

This movie was 100% in the vein of Stan and Steve's vision. After all, what made Spider-Man the most popular superhero of all time, was it's relatability. The heart of the character is summed up in Uncle Ben's immortal words, ""With great power, comes great responsibility."" This is as true today, as it was over fifty years ago, and this movie completely embraces and expands on this concept.

1026,22 February 2021,nicolasmaczk,10," Can't get any better, comes down to taste, really","This is by far the best Spider-Man movie of all of them. The art style is so incredibly unique in how it utilizes aspects from comic books. Not only that but the entire film is dotted in most scenes or textured in other ways akin to the tv show Chowder. The next thing you notice in this movie is the sound, more specifically, the music. The music is amazing and perfectly fits every scene throughout. Not only that but the fact that so much of the music is Post Malone fits perfectly with Miles Morales' life and character within the film. It also creates a very modern feeling that other movies lack. The level of absurdity is great and totally works with the animation and plot. This even allows for some great humor moments. Even throughout the absurdity and fast-paced animation style, the movie still manages to hold onto a meaningful and well thought out spiderman origin story with amazing characters that are incredibly well developed. Even the villain has a good motive with an extreme plan fueled by emotion, a good trope in any movie really. Lastly I will address the thing that most people talk about, a black Spider-Man. I will say that unlike other movies, this movie does diversity right. Miles' culture and heritage does play a role in the movie and is clearly visible to the audience, however, nothing about the plot revolves around his race and culture. He's not 'black Spider-Man' but he is Miles Morales, a character that proves to the world that anyone can be a hero with enough determination.",

The humour was overly forced and at some points more like a slap in the face. The action in the film was all a bit rushed and what can only be described as clumsy.

I'm going to make this review fairly short, as quite frankly I really don't have much to say about this film.I know many people loved this movie, myself sadly I did not. I was totally bored all the way throughout and even kept nodding off for a few seconds here and there .Don't get me wrong the ANIMATION was FANTASTIC BRILLIANT, but if there is a stupid story behind it then in my book, it's a waste of time. I really wasn't keen on any of the characters except for SPIDERMAN NOIR voiced by NICK CAGE and WILSON FISK voiced by LIEV ( RAY DONOVAN ) SCHRIEIBER, both of whom I admire as talented actors. Don't get me started with that idiotic SPIDERMAN PIG which was more like POKE'MON than SPIDERMAN. That's when I just really had enough. I remember when I was a kid i used to look forward to a tv show called GLEN MICHAEL'S CARTOON CAVALCADE. This was a show which predominately showed toon type short cartoons, however there was one more serious type of cartoon, a favourite of which of mine was SPIDERMAN usually shown as a weekly 2 part episodes. This was suberb, and the reason I am bringing this up is that all that time way back in the late 60's and early 70's these SPIDERMAN Toons were wae better than this rubbish. Let me iritterate , again the ANIMATION for SPIDER-VERSE was truly MAGNIFICENT. If these guys had a better story and script then perhaps it would have been truly magnificent. One last thing. I absolutely hated the RAP MUSIC and BLAND songs. A QUINCY JONES - LALO SCHIFRIN style JAZZY score would have suited better. It wouldn't make the script better but it certainly would be more pleasing to the ear. Ending on another note I also thought the gags were awful , and could have done with the gags from AQUAMAN which was out the same week and if you read my review on it , you will see I absolutely loved it.

3D not warranted so try and watch in 2D.

Animation was okay but turned brilliant with comic book type narration.
It was good to see Spidey's arch rival - The Kingpin make his first appearance in a Spider movie.

1059,8 December 2018,minnesh-77256,10, Brilliant movie - must watch even if you hate animated movies,"This was definitely the best movie of 2018! The characters, voice actors, setting, animation and cinematography are all executed excellently. I was a little worried about having a black spider-man with a black family - and hear me out!- I was just worried that the developers were going to use Myles' skin colour as a way of punching in the face with a Spider-man-should-be-black-because-we-want-him-to attitude, that is all.
Myles is the perfect embodiment of a relatable teenager for those who watched in the theatres or at home. He has elements any teenager could relate to: loss, school, the struggle to make friends, father issues. Yeah, he's a convincing super-hero, but his issues in life are something that any teenager can empathise with, no matter which element of Myles needs to be plucked out.
The rest of the alternative Spider-man characters - well - I was nervous about them, too. An anime spider-woman? A Spider-Woman? A Spider-Pork?! I was nervous. However, this film doesn't treat its audiences like idiots. Furthermore, the characters were immensely likeable, and whether you enjoy watching anime, or have grown out of cartoons, you will feel a lot of enthusiasm towards these alternative spider heroes. And, thankfully, they didn't abuse Spider-Woman's character by stocking her as the being-a-spider-woman-is-so-difficult position.
Moreover, some of the villains were underwhelming for me (except for our new Doctor Octopus). Though, when it came to Kingpin, I have never admired his character as much as I do now. His portrayal in this film had me feeling apologetic for him (you'll have to watch to understand) and his motives have never been as clear to me as they are now.
I'm not a big fan of the rap genre or any of its sub-genres. However, I'm going to be realistic and say that the music in this was hammered down to perfection! When music, of any genre, is added to films they need to be delivered right. Into The Spider-Verse does this without a doubt. No matter the situation, the music was manufactured to work in each situation; sad, irritable, happy and exciting moments.
The animation is extremely inspiring and will have a colossal effect on the beauty you want to see. Night, day and danger, in this film, are all carefully fabricated into a style and theme of appeal. Even the fight scenes between the characters are designed excitedly. And, overall, the animation in this film is unique and nothing I've personally observed before.
Anyone who wants to remember and honor Stan Lee's memory, get inspired, understand themselves and gain motivation, this is the movie to watch. And hell, you may even want to animate as your dream career. After all, this movie is motivationally thought-changing.",

The style of painting is like a comic strip moving directly. There are a lot of imaginative and expressive shots that cannot be achieved by live-action movies. This is the advantage of animation.

1069,6 June 2023,eunbi0530,6," Mid film, Marvel is cutting costs on the writers","Note: I say it's overrated, but I still think it deserved the Oscar. Now To the review!
When I heard this film had a 97 percent on RT, I was shocked. A Spider-Man movie with a 97% and everyone including some random dude chanting in a Apex Legends lobby screaming INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE RULES!? My friend (who is a freaking legend) gave me a copy of Into the Spider-Verse and when I went home, I instantly watched it. I then proceeded to say ""Wow"" and thought it was the best Spider-Man. Several months later and rewatching it several times, Yeah, This isn't the best Spider-Man (not even close). This film has several flaws that kinda hurts it for me. 1. Dr. Ock sucks. I disliked Dr. Ock in this film, I question her motive and I questioned even more about how did she end up like this? 2. A pig Spider-Man? Really? Okay, I'm kidding about that, that isn't a flaw, Although, I still question out of all the Spider-Mans, Why this one? 3. Aunt May feels out of place. 4. Several origin stories feel somewhat rushed. 5. The self-awareness just doesn't work. 6. Most of the Jokes feel out of place.
Overall, I say this is a solid 7/10, because some jokes were funny, the voice acting was awesome, and the soundtrack was almost as good as TASM2's soundtrack, which is my favorite Spider-Man film and soundtrack.",
1070,1 January 2019,shuksam,10, A true treat for the fans.,"Sony's handling of certain Marvel properties over the last few years has certainly been questionable, but 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is everything it needed to be and so much more. A thrilling blend of action, humour and emotion, wrapped in an awe-inspiring animation style, 'Into the Spider-Verse' is one of the standout movies of 2018, and arguably the best iteration of the web-slinger. Marvel's animated projects are usually overlooked due to the figurehead that is the MCU, but this is a leap in the right direction. The premise of multiple characters with a great power and great responsibility, all of whom feel isolated in their respective universes, adds an interesting layer. After realising they are not alone, they seek solace in one another, working together in an attempt to find a way back to their respective worlds, each leaving understanding the importance they hold in the universe. Miles in particular finds himself along the way, overcoming family issues and the hardships of teenage life, all whilst coming to terms with his recently acquired superpowers. I'm sure we'd all like to be a spider-person, but we learn that we don't need to be the biggest or the strongest to be a superhero - because in our own way, we already are. But hey, you never know when you might get bit by a radioactive spider, right?",

Now caught in a fight against Wilson Fisk turns into this inter-dimensional clash, one the proved to be too much to handle for only two super-powered Spider-Men. Once messing with dimensions, Miles meets and recruits 5 other super-powered Spider-Men and women from their respective dimensions in this battle over time and space.

1073,12 January 2021,shawnmikedryer,10, Groundbreaking animation!!,"If you can look past the obvious pandering to the PC mantra that every effective team must consist of one brilliant black, a strong minority woman, and a white male who is a screw-up looking for redemption, then it's a pretty good movie.",
1074,13 July 2021,Connor213,9, GREAT MOVIE!,"This is an immensely fun and beautiful film. The main characters (Miles, Peter B. Parker, and Gwen) were generally well-developed. And the relationships and banter between that crew was genuinely interesting.
However, the plot ran into some issues. The main villain, Kingpin, for example does have decent motivations that are eventually explained, but he never feels like a real person, largely due to his exaggerated physical appearance. And so the conflicts with Kingpin rarely feel like genuine conflicts, but rather these are forces that are in opposition because it is demanded by the script.
Similarly, 3 of the spider-people (Peni, Noir, & Ham) are under-developed. They are funny, entertaining characters that are pleasing to watch, but because there are so many characters in this film, there simply isn't time to develop all of them and the movie suffers as a result. For example, there is an emotional moment near the end regarding Peni that doesn't work well because her character wasn't built-up enough for that emotional pay-off to work. The result is that the moment feels hollow and insincere, breaking up the pace of the action scene it interrupts. I really like these 3 and I'd like to see more of them, but to bring them into the film all at once and then not develop them or give them true character arcs, makes them feel under-utilized.
Spider-verse is still a very entertaining experience and most of the film succeeds, but it is a bit disappointing to me that what Sony Animation built here is a platform for an amazing film with great performances and gorgeous art-style, but the final film is only very good, and doesn't quite live up to it's potential. I think this film was bit too ambitious, trying to bring in a large crew of heroes and multiple villains, and too many of those pieces were just not properly developed.
The final result is a film that varies from a 7 to a 9 out of 10 throughout its runtime, as it's held back by the aforementioned flaws. And so my final score is a 8/10.",

Into the spider-verse is the 7´th movie of the superhero, it might look at first sight that this only another spider-man movie, it actually isn´t.

The movie immerses you into the comic world through lively action and cool editing. Although many people claim it's the best comic movie yet, I still think it falls short in that category, but it is an entertaining film.

A lot was taken from the Sam Raimi Spider-Man Trilogy and the beginning is pretty rushed and can confuse those who aren't familiar with Spider-Man. It having almost 100% on Rotten Tomatoes is a major over statement. It's still a great film and a must see for Spider-Man fans. But normal film watchers, maybe skip this one. It's also no where near comic book accurate to Spider Verse or even Miles, so if that's what you're looking for this isn't your movie.",

The story is also very fun and engaging up until the point when you realize that the plot is barely hanging on by a single thread and it still manages to stand up to every other super hero film in recent memory. The last 10 minutes was also a letdown for me and the film could have wrapped up in a more succinct and original way. Still, definitely see this in theaters to get the full and nearly-flawless visual experience. Even the ""dull"" moments are a joy to watch.

When I saw the trailer for this movie I wasn't impressed , in fact I thought it was a cashgrab from sony with the remaining rights for Spider-Man they have left. And I was wrong. The story is about different spider men / woman from different dimensions , it's also an origin movie for Miles morales' spiderman. For those of you who've watched the ultimate Spider-Man cartoon crossover, the characters might not be new to you but they're all just wayyyy better than the tv epsiode. The animation in this movie is like stop motion but with a very fast frame rate which you grow on with as the movie progresses. The artstyle is just super cool , it's like a comic book with the thinking boxes and the POW , BAM stuff ! . The movie has really good voice actors and a powerful soundtrack , cause sony ( duh) and yes ! Tons and tons of product placement . The humour in this movie is really good , it's the best I've seen in animated movies since Zootopia. The movie has loads of Easter eggs , fourth walls , one liners which makes your spider sense tingle. In the end , into the spiderverse was way beyond my expectations , with great characters , 4th wall breaking , a slick artstyle , great humour and everything you love about Spiderman . It's like if 90s Disney made a Spiderman movie that your kids will be watching on repeat mode , ten years down the line.",

1154,29 October 2019,heirman_steven,10, A master piece,"This is easily the best Spider-Man film released to theaters. While the story itself is a little weak, that is made up with an exceptional animation style. You also get a great score from Daniel Pemberton (his best work since ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.). The voice work is another standout here, with excellent use of Nicolas Cage as well.
My other criticism, other than the flimsy story, does go back to the music, though. More than once, the licensed music that is played after an emotional scene takes you out of the moment. Which is a shame because other than that the choices in music are on point.
The cast of characters in ""Into the Spider-Verse"" is wonderful. Miles father is written very well and feels believable. The other Spider characters are particularly enjoyable. The older Peter Parker is very engaging and has a good arc. Gwen Stacy and Peni Parker are also very fun to see interact with everyone else.
The animation alone is worth the price of admission. 2018 will hopefully go down as the year for Spider-Man. From the blockbuster PS4 game, one of the most emotional moments in Infinity Wars focused on Spider-Man, and ending the year with not only the best movie from Sony Animation, but also the best Spider-Man movie.",

This was actually really really good everything about it is about it is innovative and the story I thought it was childish is really complex and deep. The animation of this film is unlike anything you've ever seen unlike Pixar that tends to focus on realism this one is surreal and isn't afraid of it's animation status, it takes advantage of it. The colors, the comic theme the excellent soundtrack all is mesmerizing. Yet that's not all the rapport between our characters is very humain and heartfelt especially the Spidermen, despite it been animated you feel the depth of the bond they formed more particularly the one between miles and peter parker with there father son, big young bothers Dynamic that's can't but make you aw.

Is the personality that matters). I found Miles dislikable, as well as Peter D. (Or B?) Parker. Other characters didn't have enough screen time to show any personality. It was long, boring, and the humor wasn't as good as other SpiderMan content. I had to force myself to watch it to the end because I already paid for it, and well, maybe it'd get better at the end.

Into the the spiderverse has everything the mcu lacks (good acting, directing, tension, humor that is actually funny, drama that actually matters, an interesting visual style, and characters that do things other than making obnoxious quips every five seconds). It isn't perfect, some parts are predictable and while they try to give the villains some depth they still aren't that interesting.

1184,9 January 2019,jayham-99975,9, The Best Sony Pictures Animation Film!!!!,"In my opinion it's better than the Sam Raimi trilogy, better than both amazing spider-man films, better than homecoming and even better than the Japanese Spider-man show. It is also the best animated super hero film I've seen, but where I have seen every spider-man film and tv show, I haven't seen every animated super hero film so that might change.
What it is is pretty much what you would get if you made a film based on a mix of modern marvel and Stan Lee's original Spider-man run and then made it a whole lot better than you would expect from that description. The animation, voice acting and cinematography are amazing. While the story is kind of done before, that is mostly in comics and not as a film. Not all villains have gotten the time to develop, but honestly, somehow that makes them feel realer. I'm not 100% sure I'll still feel like this after my second watch, but right now it is really hard to decide between a 9 and a 10.",

I really cannot express how much I loved this movie. It's Hollywood so they'll try do another but I am not sure they'll ever top that now.",
1186,12 April 2020,stretchfoofight,10," Awesome, funny, great story, interesting characters",Thank you Sony for this visualy STUNNING masterpiece.,
1187,25 December 2018,tonkvrie,10, The best spider-man film,There has been a great deal of praise thrown at this film and whilst there is a lot to like and admire there are a few flaws.,
1188,19 March 2019,TheWordYo,9, With great stories you get great movies.,"I did not have the opportunity to see this movie in its premiere months ago, but taking advantage of the fact that it returned to the cinemas of my city due to its nomination to the Oscars I decided to see it and WAO! what a surprise
Beautiful story, incredible animation, witty jokes, great soundtrack, wonderful message, good villain and especially endearing characters.
This movie has everything and deserves the Oscar award and above all deserves to be in the Best Movie category, more than Black Panther",
1189,28 February 2019,asherwiegartz,7, Best. Apology. Ever.,"This is by far one of the best animated movies ever made. The voice over work, story telling, plot twists, characters, action, great animation and more keeps the movie in a very entertaining mode. It took a few minutes for things to start working but once they did it worked all the way. I thought Incredibles 2 was worthy of winning the Oscar this year for best animated feature but Into the Spider verse is now the sure fire winner in my book.",
1190,6 June 2023,stevenjlowe82,6," Stunning animation, mediocre story....",The movie was quite good but there were a lot of missing spiderverse charecters.How ever The plot was so awesome so it is a must watch,
1191,3 February 2019,iamluisk,10, BEAUTIFUL!!!,"This film is just AMAZING. It's not only visually astonishing but the story is an incredible journey that shows us that everyone can be a hero in its own way. As a HUGE Spider-Man fan, I was blown away by all the action and emotion this movie provides, it's definitely a love letter to marvel fans. Hailee Steinfeld, Shameik Moore and Jake Johnson make an spectacular job portraying Gwen Stacy, Miles Morales, and Peter B. Parker respectively. For me ""Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse"" is just the best Spider-Man movie ever.",
1192,29 January 2019,mitchellmcmiller,9, Animation GOLD,The animation is spectacular in this movie and it has such a unique look that it feels like we are reading a comic book when we're just watching it play out on screen. It is also surprisingly hilarious and the comedy is actually one of the best aspects of the film.,
1193,20 April 2019,unsalakgun,8, A well plot with missing things.,"This movie developed its character through the struggle to keep your family, love them, but also live your vocation? How do you know you're doing it right? You won't. It's a leap of faith.",
1194,27 December 2020,emiporrasnc-74766,10, A LOVE LETTER TO SPIDER-MAN FANS,A breakthrough in superhero movies. Combine the advantages of comic books perfectly with movies. Great music.,
1195,30 March 2022,BenjaminPopkin,9, One of My Favorite Animated Movies,"The movie is great. The voice actors did well, and the animation was on point considering they had a small budget. A must see film in my opinion.",
1196,4 January 2019,jnlewisiii,10, Amazing movie with real value?,"This movie is amazing and deserves greater than a 10/10. As an animator, I look at this movie and all I can say is.. wow, the art-style is unique and fits AMAZINGLY with the idea of the movie; it's probably the most unique style I've personally ever seen. The animation is probably even better, with small details here and there that add to the characters and what they represent, speaking of small details, Brooklyn is beautiful in comparison to the cities of other modern animated movies and it genuinely looks lived in. Also, I MUST mention the sound design, I mean, they used spray-cans in Mile's theme! Every Spider-Man (or woman) character gets their own theme that sounds different from one another but also quite similar. Anyway, that's my quick review of this movie, go watch it or.. you're life will most likely be incomplete.",
