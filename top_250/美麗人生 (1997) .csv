1,27 March 2000,Anonymous_Maxine,10," Funny, entertaining, and amazingly intense and dramatic.","I find it sad that so many people are so narrow-minded that they will not watch a movie that is black and white or, in this case, is subtitled. I feel sorry for people who refuse to watch a movie like Life Is Beautiful just because it is a foreign film. They have no idea what a beautifully acted and directed film this is, and they'll never know what an amazing experience they are missing. ",r
2,4 September 2001,Nazi_Fighter_David,10," A satire set in a concentration camp, tough a hit internationally, was thought by some critics to be in bad taste...","Mixing humor and the Holocaust isn't anything new: Ernst Lubitsch's 'To Be Or Not To Be' is just one enduring classic; Mel Brooks' 'The Producers' is another; and 'Life Is Beautiful' has the small-town charm and ambiance of 'Amarcord,' and light-straight satire of 'The Great Dictator.'",e
3,29 August 2000,amira_berzi,9, One of the best movies ever.,"This is one of those movies that have a lasting effect on you.   After watching it, I found that it has less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the human feelings and the beautiful relationship of a father and his son.  The holocaust provides the ultimate context, that brings and highlights the story and adds yet another deep dimension to the movie.  No such piece of art has ever before combined laughter and tears of sadness in me before and that is the miracle of the movie.  The realism of the movie is not its strong point, but then again it is  not supposed to be; this helps in bringing the audiences to a state of mind away from reality, focusing on the feelings generated by forgetting about all external events and developments of the war.  Despite that, the movie does not fail to point out an element of the nazi psychology demonstrated by the doctor who was obsessed with riddles.  This portrayed the nazi 'state of mind' (if ever such an expression existed) as a sick mentally disturbed state.  Life is really beautiful as you watch Guido's relentless efforts to make a lovely exciting experience of the concentration camp to his son.  You get exhausted just watching him going through his painful day and yet you smile as he speaks to his son and makes him laugh.  One can go on forever  describing the creativity of this movie, but one will not be able to capture all its beauty in writing.",v
4,19 July 2005,planktonrules,10, funny and disturbing,"Before I watched this film, I was a bit hesitant because the basic premise sounds so ridiculous--a man who uses humor and imagination to shield his son from the horrors of the holocaust while in a concentration camp! I mean, how can this movie be funny? Is this another ""Hogan's Heroes"" or what, I thought.",i
5,26 February 1999,Serpico-7,9, A superb tragi-comedy,"Roberto Benigni's Vita e bella, is in many ways similar to Chaplin's Great Dictator.  Both are comic attacks on fascism, but the former's is the more successful.  Benigni initially accesses the emotions of his audience through simple comedy, which is a pleasant mix of Keaton and Chaplin.  Romance ensues with his real life wife Nicoletta Braschi.  The first half of this film has been seen by various critics as being inferior to the second, but this is certainly not the case.  In the first section we follow the delightful romance that will eventually lead to marriage and the creation of the wonderful Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini).",e
6,12 November 2005,gaur-abhi,9, The most aptly named movie - A classic,"I have never in my life seen a movie that so truly symbolizes its name and its message. Roberto Benigni - 'The Italian Treasure House' has probably given to his viewers his best. The story, the performances, the entire theme of a person performing his duties as a husband, as a father is very 'moving' and inspiring. 'Life is beautiful' as the name goes is about a Jewish man, who falls in love with a non-Jewish lady, marries her, has a kid and who is then taken as a prisoner in a concentration camp along with his wife and kid. But the way he protects his kid from the horrors of the genocide, how he always tries to find ways to make his wife and kid smile and laugh, is what makes the movie, a MUST SEE.",w

8,12 November 2000,gbheron,9, A Movie About Hope,"Life Is Beautiful takes the premise that love and hope can survive the most trying of conditions, in this case a Nazi concentration camp. Most everyone knows this very popular and honored film, so I won't belabor the story. Briefly, in my humble opinion, this film deserves all the accolades it's been awarded. A near perfect film, my only gripe is that Mr. Benigni's performance could have been more understated, especially the half of the film that's set in the concentration camp. But this is only a slight complaint. For a joyful, life-affirming movie, Life Is Beautiful is tops. But be forewarned, as its principal backdrop of anti-Semitism and Nazi murder, it is not a very happy movie.",r
9,6 December 1999,kvonarx,10, The Best Movie I've seen for a long long time,"I am surprised about the negative comments that some people made on this web-page.  I can see how some people might not experience the same kind of uplift or joy that most of us lived through when seeing the movie.  But that some viewers felt insulted and betrayed because the movie did not depict ""reality"" as it really was or is, is not fair.",w
10,25 June 1999,baumer,9, The best foreign language film I have ever seen.,"I typically don't care much for sub-titled movies.  Foreign films to me are slow and about nothing.  So I naturally went to see Life is Beautiful with a chip on my shoulder.  I wanted to hate it.  I wanted it to be just another movie that Hollywood was praising to show that they were an intelligent bunch of people.  Oh boy was I in for the surprise of my life.  Not only is this film good, I honestly believe that it was the second best film of 98, next to Saving Private Ryan.  The mere fact that Shakespeare in Love won best picture over not only Ryan but over this, is a joke.  It's actually funny.",8
11,12 July 2005,lee_eisenberg,10, Roberto Benigni is a GENIUS,"""Life is Beautiful"" is more than a masterpiece. It is possibly THE most incredibly wonderful movie that exists. Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni) is a Jewish waiter in 1930s Italy. He has managed to hide his ethnic background, although he is fully aware of the anti-Semitism around him (one man has sons named Adolf and Benito). To counter Mussolini's nationalism, he goes to a school to ""prove"" that the Italians are a superior race: he shows off his bellybutton. After some flings with ""principesa"" Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), the two of them get married and have a son named Giosue (called Joshua in the subtitles).",8
12,30 January 2006,farkas419,10, One of the Best Movies I've Ever Seen,"The first time I saw the movie was when I was about seventeen or so, and I never forgot it. The incredibly human characters (such as the doctor who loved riddles), the fantastic script-writing, the amazing acting, and of course the heartwarming story. This movie proves once and for all how strong we are, as humans, that in the face of adversity we can make the best of things. There is so much love in the characters; Dora's love for her husband Guido is boundless, as well as Guido's love for his son. Sure, it's a slightly unrealistic movie, but hey, aren't they all a little unrealistic? I've also seen people review this movie and say that it made light of the Holocaust, which was of course a dark point in history. I don't think so; I think that it's only delicately handled, and because of that, the movie is one that a person can watch in one sitting without being thoroughly disgusted by mankind. I would say that those who think this movie is too ""light"" are cynical and bitter. The whole point to the movie is to show what love is capable of, and to provide encouragement and perhaps guidance. This movie changed my life from the first time I watched it. I came away with this feeling that no matter what I have to face in life, that I can overcome it. This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone over the age of eleven. The acting is superb (though Roberto Benigni is a little over-the-top, LOL), the story heartwarming and easy to understand. It's excellent!",1
13,19 December 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Visually stunning, but uneven. For me the second half was better than the first","Before I eventually saw this film, I was not sure whether I was going to like it or not. While in general it is very highly regarded, there have been those who have said it is overrated or whatever. Just for the record, I did like the movie very much. It is uneven, and there were parts that didn't work as well as intended, but this is a brave and affectionate realisation of life during the Holocaust. I asked myself after watching Life is Beautiful, is it really overrated. Well, maybe a tad, but I can really see why people like this movie.",3
14,4 January 2015,classicsoncall,9," ""Nothing is more necessary than the unnecessary"".","Remember when Roberto Benigni's name was announced as winner of the Best Actor Oscar? He was literally jumping out of his skin to be declared the winner. It perfectly resonated with the character he portrayed in ""Life is Beautiful"". Now I understand why he was so excited, as I hadn't seen the film until now.",7
15,6 February 2005,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,9, A beautiful film... but not an entirely perfect one,"When I first saw this film, I was told up front that the first full hour of the film, the first half, was all slapstick comedy and character development, and that the second half was more serious and important. I prepared myself mentally for the first half, but I was still surprised by how annoying the gags and jokes were. We're talking cake-in-face, fall-over, slip-on-banana humor. For one full hour. At the end of the first half of this film, I was thinking ""this had better get better very soon..."" And it did. Right then and there. From the very beginning of the second half, the serious mood enters. And it doesn't take long for even the most average minded viewer to realize that the first half of humor and character development was important. It was important for us to ease into a less tense mood, to make the important subject strike even harder, and for us to get to know the characters, to make us care more about what happens to them. I've just finished seeing it for the second time, and I've come to realize that this film is not entirely perfect, as I felt just after seeing it through first time. It does have its flaws, though there aren't many of them. The first half, and some parts of the second half, are heavy on humor, which some will mistake for making fun of the subject(which is almost a crime), or trying to make it seem less important. I don't believe this to be true, it's just a retelling with a more positive message; yes, people do horrible, inhumane things sometimes... but after all, there is beauty, too. The first half will also deter some viewers who will enjoy the second half much more. The plot is very good, though slightly unrealistic. The acting is pretty much all flawless, even in the child actors. The characters are well-written and interesting. The humor is more acceptable in the second part, because it's more toned down and not trying way too hard to get a quick laugh out of the audience. All in all, a great film which anyone and everyone should see at least once during their life... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll realize that, in the end, Life Is Beautiful. I recommend this to just about anyone, but I know that not everyone will enjoy it equally. A near-perfect film. Keep watching past the first half... you won't regret it. 9/10",1
16,28 November 2009,jcaraway3,10, Slapstick humor in a holocaust film?,"You betcha. But it's not as offensive as you think. In fact, it's not offensive at all. It's a powerful and moving film about the power of family and what one man will do when that family is threatened. The plot is as follows: after Germans attack Italy, Guido and his family are forced into a concentration camp. Guido spends most of the rest of the film desperately trying to convince his young son that the holocaust is nothing but a game- and that the child has to keep out of sight in order to win. He promises him that the winner will earn a full size tank- and the boy does get a tank at the end of the film, just not in the way he thinks he will. The first hour or so is pure slapstick/romantic comedy, and the second hour or so is moving and heartbreaking- with touches of humor to(I assume) keep the audience from becoming too depressed or disturbed. I was amazed at how it could dramatically shift from comedy to drama so quickly. ",9
17,4 December 2012,ma-cortes,8, Marvelous tale about a likable Jewish protecting his son and wife from horrifying concentration camp,"Wonderful fable plenty of amazing fantasy, lively comedy and sad tragedy . This is a poignant and moving fable about a sacrifice to save a son and a wife . It's an unforgettable story formed by two halves that proves imagination, family and love conquer all ; as Benigni's focus is on the love between daddy , mummy and son . The first part results to be an Italian comedy style , the second is horror along with humor . It concerns upon Guido (Roberto Benigni, a magnificent rubber-faced funny man), a Jewish man who has a wonderful romance with the help of his humour, but must use that same quality to protect his son in a Nazi death camp . He's a madcap romantic man and women wish him . But he falls in love with Dora (Benigni's real-life sweetie Nicoletta Braschi). Every day Guido dreams of marrying her , under Nicola Piovani score . When the Second World War spontaneously breaks out , he and his family is imprisoned at concentration camp . Guido is determined to save his lover and son (Cantarini) from dangers around them . His effort sometimes is pure fantasy , though with ruse he pull off more impetus to keep his son and accomplishes feats no man could realistically execute . Guido fabricates an elaborated game to convince his child that the whole ordeal is an endurance proof to be won with prizes forthcoming , as it turns out to be a special contest to win a tank.",/
18,12 December 1998,JonB-2,9, Begnigni è Genio (Begnigni's a Genius),"On seeing this film, my first thought (after wiping the tears from my eyes) was ""My god, he pulled it off.""  I can think of only one other director who's dealt with the Holocaust in a comedic film and done it with any depth, and his name was Chaplin -- and ""The Great Dictator"" was made before the horrors of the Final Solution were known to the world.  Chaplin didn't have to deal with that baggage.  Begnigni did, and did so brilliantly.",?
19,28 January 2013,eric262003,9, Shows a Lighter Edge To A Tragic Event In History,"I never thought the day would come when a movie centred during the Holocaust would be provided with humour. The Holocaust was anything but funny then and now as thousands of Europeans of Jewish faith were killed off mainly towards fear, paranoia, economical insecurity and just plain hatred. But once in a while towards sadness, we can open our hearts and try to survive the grimness with some humour to raise our spirit. And that is exactly what actor/director/writer Roberto Benigni succeeds in ""Life is Beautiful"". It's a refreshing break from the graphic and and disturbing images that has haunted the theatres past and present like Spielberg's ""Schildler's List"" or Polanski's ""The Pianist"" as we look to a more brighter side of the Holocaust mainly toward the humour of the leading protagonist, Guido Orefice (Benigni).",r
20,27 October 2002,TheGautamMathur,10, Bon Giorno Principezza!!!!,"Contains Spoiler Every once in a while a movie comes along which makes you question the kind of man you are. How do you handle situations? If you were put in the same situation, Would you come out of it smiling? Do you have the courage? Guido (Benigni) did. Life is beautiful charms you right from the opening shot of the beautiful Italian countryside. It takes you into the life of Guido, a young Italian Jewish Waiter who has a beautiful way of looking at things. he never seems to look at anmything negatively, in fact, his frivolous view to life is what makes you sit riveted throughout. I don't think he's delusional, he is a very serious man, and he sees the gravity of situations in his life, but he doesn't want the people around him to feel it, hence his ever-smiling, effervescent demeanour. It all seems like a fairy tale. His landing into the school as the impostor school inspector and lecture on the virtues of the navel... His galloping down into the ballroom on the horse and whisking his bride away towards a happy life... His superspeed bike ride down the town square... things that we all dream of. An untouched innocence. The movie takes a dramatic turn when he finds himself in a concentration camp with his son... His made up story of how the camp is a game and the father-son team are the leading competitors... An unmatched courage. Not one to cry in movies as a rule, I found myself alone at home one day, and when the boy is hidden in the little box, looking at his father being led away at gun point, getting scared... and then, the father doing what he usually does to reassure the boy that the situation is not as serious as it looks... the clown march... I felt tears roll down my cheeks. And then, i started sniffing... after a while, the sniffs turn into sobs, and ultimately, when his father is dead, and the boy sees the American tank coming towards him, the elation in his eyes, the jubilation at winning first prize... it turned the sobs into a full fledged howl. Thats when i got the message... That's when the maginitude of the sacrifice made by the father in an effort to protect his son hit me like a thunderbolt and hasn't left me since. Thats when you realize that life is all about loving, and protecting and cherishiong your loved ones. and despite all the troubles, the despair and the danger that one may face, Life is... Beautiful.",e

22,28 June 2020,henry8-3,7, Life is Beautiful,"A film of 2 halves. The first is a joyous lighthearted comedy with Benigni trying everything to woo Braschi. The second half takes a far more serious turn with a Benigni and Braschi (now married) and their young son (Cantarini) send to a concentration camp. Here he tries to protect his son from the horrors by pretending it's all a game, with a real tank going to the winner.",_
23,5 February 2022,wisneskilife,10, Unlike Anything,"I've never been so uncomfortable enjoying something in my entire life. How can anyone make a ""comedy"" out of the Holocaust? Well, they did and it was a work of art. In short, a dad convinces his son that the concentration camp they're in is actually a game where he wins a tank if they get the most points. All while finding ways to show his wife he's still alive. The first hour of the movie is a little slow, but shows subtle ways nazis are affecting Italy. Then the last 30 minutes are just tear jerkingly painful. My jaw never left the floor all while I cried like a baby. Perfect in every sense of the word.",=
24,23 July 2007,FilmCriticLalitRao,8, Life is beautiful as to make it smart as everything depends on your attitude.,"""Life is beautiful"",is a film about that brief period of Nazi rule in Italy due to which many ordinary Jewish people had to endure enormous hardships.Although it is a film about Nazism,it is quite different from other films of the Nazi film genre like Schindler's list.It is more of a film about comic romance,laughter,optimism and how to keep one's sanity intact when one finds oneself in a difficult close to death kind of situation. This film ran into trouble as many leading filmmakers protested against what they called ""making mockery of a serious issue like holocaust"".According to Godard it is hard to believe that life could have been beautiful for anyone in a concentration camp.Life is beautiful is divided into 3 parts:carefree life,period of hardships and a harmless game with a kid.Roberto Benigni and his wife excel in all these parts.It is the star kid Giorgio Cantarini who shines in the last part.In a way,it can be said that the film succeeds because of his innocent behavior with which he carries himself through his entire stay with his father.",t

26,5 November 2013,jackasstrange,8, To See the Good Side of Life,"'La Vite è Belle' touches very deeply into the concept of meaning of life. It's a study about seeing the beautiful side of the things, doesn't matter the nature of that thing. It looks like a hard theme to put in film, because it's not that easy to convince the viewer to buy such theme. So director Roberto Benigni picked a very controversial and somewhat extreme subject to put this idea in: The Holocaust. Hardly someone would think in a good side of the Holocaust, and certainly it hasn't any. But we can only cheer and appreciate what Benigni tried to do. He dared a lot doing that.",_

The movie is not the effective and emotional involving concentration camp movie it promised to be, which is due to some poor choices of storytelling and its approach.

34,8 July 2014,aharmas,8, What an Achievement,"Benigni makes the film. I believe if it had in someone else's hands, it would probably not work, but there is something about this man's facial features. Somehow he connects with you, and yet he's so different from everyone else. Most of us can't conjure fairy tales and magical moments like his protagonist.

39,28 February 2012,Artimidor,10, Holocaust meets comedy and someone who can pull it off,"Question: Is there any conceivable way at all to combine the holocaust with comedy and get laughs out of it? Well, not really I'd say, not without completely sacrificing the unspeakable horrors the concept of organized mass murder stands for. One shouldn't even try. If you look closer at Roberto Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"" you will see that such an attempt isn't actually made either in this film. It's not about ridiculing Nazis, confronting them with their own absurdities or pretend to go along with their ideas to make the underlying idiocy apparent. This is just a means. Rather the film creates a parallel, carefree world alongside the horrific reality of the Nazis, which is upheld by the central character Guido (played by Benigni himself), a clown at heart. All this in order to keep up the illusion of a perfect world for his son Giosué in the face of impending doom. ""Ah, the train ride was no good,"" the father admits to his son when they arrive at the concentration camp. ""When we go back we take the bus. I'll tell them!"" And when young Giosué wants to quit what Guido has convinced him to be just a game, his father is the first one to head out: ""We're in the lead now, but well, we won't get the big prize then. Too bad."" And suddenly Giosué reconsiders.",
40,21 June 1999,Rumples,9," Absolutely amazing, one of my all-time favorites","This movie is simply brilliant. Casting aside all of the trappings of modern movie-making (special effects, brain-jarring sound, big name stars, bizarre plots and settings, language sex and big explosions) it produces instead a film which captivates audiences because of its simplicity, classy acting and the sheer beauty of its tale. In what may well be the hallmark of a great movie, opinions of LIB are markedly polarised - the number of '1' votes are about equal to the range of 2-6, strongly illustrating that it is difficult to be indifferent to this movie. This is a major difference between LIB and most of what Hollywood churns out where indifference is the only acceptable response. It saddens me that so many people have failed to recognise the charm of this film by choosing to take offence at the way in which the Holocaust was portrayed. I am not Jewish (or Romany, Eastern European, handicapped etc) and would not attempt to presume to tell any of these groups how to react to this portrayal but I can say that I was more moved, more hurt by man's inhumanity towards man, by LIB than I was by Schindler's List or any other Holocaust movie or doco. I, like many others, came out of this film wanting all my friends to go see it. The sub-titles in no way detract from the experience, in fact they are hardly noticeable after a little while. My vote 9/10.",
41,17 March 2007,ackstasis,9," ""This is a simple story... but not an easy one to tell.""","For the last 60 years, films regarding the Holocaust have had to tread carefully. It is truly a horrifying and disheartening period in Mankind's history, and, quite evidently, little humour could possibly be derived from it. Perhaps the last mainstream film to attempt such a thing was Charles Chaplin's classic 1940 satire, 'The Great Dictator,' which memorably spoofed Hitler and his Nazi regime, and poignantly highlighted the plight of the Jews. Indeed, Chaplin's film was released approximately a year before the true Nazi death camps, such as Auschwitz, were constructed, and Chaplin would later state in his 1964 autobiography, had he known the actual extent of the Holocaust's horrors, he could never have made such jokes about the Nazi regime.",

43,6 October 2007,blairgallop7,10, A movie that truly proves that Life is Beautiful,"This movie is one of the ten best movies I have ever watched. Life is Beautiful(La Vita e Bella) is an Italian film which is set in 1930's Arezzo,Tuscany which is in central Italy. Roberto Benigni's performance as the imaginative and humorous Guido Orefice is one of my favorite characters in film but Benigni is also good as he also directed and co-wrote the script for this film. This film won three Academy Awards which were Best Actor-Roberto Benigni, Best Foreign Film and Best Dramatic Music Score and was also nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture,Best Director-Roberto Benigni, Film Editing and Best Original Screenplay which it would win three out of the seven. This is one of my ten favorite movies of all time which I usually compare with The Truman Show as it starts out comedic but quickly takes a dramatic turn.

44,7 November 2001,claudemercure,1, The most overrated movie of the 90's,"Despite its unusual approach (it's a holocaust comedy) this is at heart a fatally self-conscious, shamelessly lowest-common-denominator film with the subtlety of a brick to the head.  When he isn't straining to act 'lovable' (actually coming off as obnoxious), Benigni keeps busy pushing every easy emotional button he can think of.  But why should we care?  His romance is never made believable, and the horror of the holocaust is never made real, because the way he edgelessly films it, we might as well be watching a film set in a medium-security prison.  (The movie numbers a grand total of one effective dramatic moment, which is Benigni's artfully handled last scene.)",
45,28 June 2002,bedazzle,10, Schopenhauer,"The first time I saw this movie I didn't remember the references to Schopenhauer, but now I've read said philosopher and was thinking about the point in using him in this movie. At first it seems like a mistake. After all, Schopenhauer is of the major philosophers, the most pessimistic. So it's strange to have him portrayed positively in such an optimistic movie. I think the movie is reinterpreting his philosophy from an optimistic perspective. Reinterpretation is a strong part of all classic works. For example, Virginia Woolfe has a crazy man interpret Shakespeare as being a misanthrope in 'Mrs. Dalloway.' Basically, Schopenhauer says that humans are conditioned by evolution to choose life over everything horrible that could happen, and that we have no choice but to obey. 'Life is Beautiful' takes this reality to be a positive. Really, it's an affirmation of the inherent goodness of life. So I think the Schopenhauer references work perfectly here.",
46,30 October 2007,TheEmulator23,4, The most overrated Film of all time!,"I will never understand why this film and the star (Roberto Benigni) were/are so highly praised. This film is mediocre and plain pathetic at what it tried to do. I felt that it was only highly praised because everyone was sooo in love with Benigni and his ridiculous antics! I will never understand how this won any Oscars, or what exactly made this a great film. Now some of my favorite films are those that deal with WWII (""Downfall"" for example) and the Holocaust. (""Schindlers List"" stomps on this.) I appreciate what was trying to be said about the inhumanity of the Holocaust, and the fathers love for his son in keeping the truth from him. I just felt that it was very repetitive and didn't say or do anything that hasn't been said or done before in film. It is still rated in the Top 100 a decade later so there is obviously those that think this is still an excellent film. I would hope that people would watch it again and see if they still feel that this is really one of the best films of all time. I just can't see how this is rated in the Top 250 when there are so many other better films that are just out of it. Doesn't it make you wonder why we have never heard of this film really since? For that matter have we even heard of Roberto Benigni since? I feel that so many of these ratings are because everyone likes HIM so well, and are therefore biased on their ratings.",

In reality he was trying to just try to divert the attention of his loved ones from the cruelties , desperation and sadness of life. The most impressive is the way he be fools his son that when they are caught in the web of Holocaust administered by Nazi Germans , he tells him and other folks that this is just a game , the won who scores most points in it will emerge as victorious and the prize is brand new tank. I loved the way really never let his son know what is going on in his surrounding and saves him from the pain , sadness and disappointment about the future.

I left the movie with a greater appreciation for the love a parent has for their child and the sense that under extreme duress sometimes its humour that drags you through to the other side. Yes it wasn't accurate, yes it was a caffeine free Holocaust Lite, but its not Schindler's List - nor a documentary. No-one with half a brain would expect that, yet here amongst all these reviews are people lambasting the movie for not being 100% factual. Last night I felt a greater empathy for what the Jews, Gypsies, Intellectuals, Political Dissidents, Blacks, Gays and all the others went through in the atrocities of Nazi Germany, but once again the belligerent attitude that accompanies any mention of The Holocaust has soured it. No-one is discounting any of the horror, but that wasn't what this movie is about.

And the women had their hair shaved off, the film apparently couldn't find extras who wouldn't shave their hair, so they put unrealistic bandanas on their heads. The camp itself doesn't even look realistic, and there is no way that the prisoners had that much freedom to walk around. I actually felt sorry for the extras in the barracks, because Begnini talked so loudly and thought he was the only one who had problems, I expected them to tell him to shut up because they were suffering too.",

It was not about the Holocaust and how Jews were killed or tortured, but instead it was how love can keep the spirit alive to go through tough times. Roberto Benigni did a wonderful job playing the character of Guido. I was so impressed to see how nothing was impossible to Guido. His hyper personality got him in trouble all the time, but his spontaneous personality helped him to find quick solutions in a very intelligent way. Guido showed us how he devoted himself to his son, even though they were in a terrible situation. He used humor and jokes to protect his son from minimizing the horrible reality that him and his family were going through at the concentration camp. Even at the most bitter moment he sweetened everyone's and his son's life with a joke or a smile. It was really shocking to me that right before Guido was killed he made sure that his son was safe and he was still joking and smiling even though he knew that he was going to be killed. This movie was made so beautifully that I strongly recommend it to anyone to watch it.",

Something maybe you only understand if you have children of your own. That no matter what - your job is to protect them. Your only reason for being- is their safety. I couldn't put myself in the position of how tragic the circumstances of any war would be. But I can put myself in the position of a father protecting his son. The love you have for a child surpasses anything. Benigni puts us in a world where the horrors of war have become part of everyday life and the only way to survive is through love.

As far this movie is concerned Roberto Benigni has done a great job as the director and as well as an actor. This is the movie where we find out that under circumstance of crisis an ordinary being like Orifice can get transformed into a Godly being in order to protect his loved ones.(Here, the wife and the son.) Its in this movie that one learns the importance of will power.(Remember the 'hat-exchange' scene? Or the 'dog near the box' scene? Or the scene in which a real,true tank arrives which the son considers to be his first prize?) This is the movie where one learns that its us who should be in control of our emotions and not vice versa.(Remember the scene where Orifice is carried away for execution? Watch his facial expressions and the way he walks in order to mask his sadness and fear in front of his son.) Its in this movie that one learns the great principle of OPTIMISM.(Remember all the scenes where Orifice keeps telling his son that they are playing a game where they have to score bonus marks and if he expresses even his desire for food(hunger) there will be substraction of marks?They were actually suffering extreme conditions in the concentration camp for being a Jew.) Even though I usually don't prefer to give ranks to my Personal choice of 25 Movies of All Time, this is an exception and this movie gets the Rank One.

Often the best (and most unsettling) comedy is the blackest, in which the intertwining of the funny and the tragic makes us consider afresh the absurdity of life and death.  And the holocaust, sadly, was horrific precisely because by the fact that it happened it proved that such events do fall within the range of human behaviour. If, in remembering the holocaust, we can only do so with solemnity, we put it in a mausoleum outside of the rest of human experience; and are thereby less, not more, likely to understand and remember.",

76,29 December 2003,themadstork,1, nauseating,"There are very few movies, no matter how bad, where I come away personally disliking all those involved.  ""Life is Beautiful"" is one of those movies. Why because beneath the shiny, happy coating ""Life is Beautiful"" embodies a narcisstic and almost nihilistic view of the world; I say this because Begnini et al. are apparently willing to use genocide to infuse a poorly written, badly acted, and sloppily directed movie with dignity it doesn't deserve.  And make no mistake this movie is all three.  The drama is fake, the segments don't flow, the acting sophomoric, the history laughable, and the characters stereotypes at best.  Begnini can do slapstick and there is a funny bit or two, but these add up to nothing and seem positively grotesque in light of what comes later.  This movie is the most banal and manipulative sort of crowd pleaser, the sort that assumes the crowd is composed entirely of idiots, but because it nominally concerns the holocaust otherwise intelligent people are unwilling to call the movies cynical little game for what it is, fearing the -""What you didn't like 'Life is Beautiful?!'  No don't say anything else you don't have a soul,"" or the more common, ""Well go back to your Jerry Bruckheimer movies.""  Well in all honesty that's an insult to Mr. Bruckheimer.  His movies may insult my intelligence, but never to the level this movie did.  At the predictable and overdone ending I remember thinking, ""I know what you want me to do movie, but there's no way I'm buying.""  Worse this movie is an insult to anyone who had to suffer because of the Nazis and their fascist allies.  Watching this movie I'm reminded of how Salem, MA uses historical atrocity as a kitchy tourist draw (going so far as to put witches on broomsticks on the sides of police cars). Begnini uses the holocaust to draw in suckers in the same way.  Group Mr. Begnini with the all those in the holocaust industry who are willing to use the worst atrocity of the 20th century to open wallets and flatter their inflated egos. Beyond being an insult to the victims of National Socialism  this movie is terrible because it crowds out much better movies on the same subject. Everyone chalks in ""Life is Beautiful"" as their art movie of the month and ignores better movies on the holocaust like ""The Ogre,"" ""Invincible,"" or ""Heimat.""",

I felt strange as I left the theater for this movie, I was impressed by the imagination that poignantly proved that love and the human spirit could conquer all, even during the worst of times. The trouble was that the worst of times was the Holocaust in an Italian concentration camp, and I kept thinking - this is terrible! As time goes on and the Holocaust becomes a thing of history, and as less survivors are alive to remember the travesty that mankind let occur, Benigni is being praised for making a film that DOES trivialize some very serious subject matter. History that is only half a century old. I think the film itself is a noble and creative effort, much like the characters in the film, but the cartoonish depiction of genocide and desperation did not sit well with me. The audience I was with laughed and cried on cue. They were manipulated. Just like the Nazi's were manipulated in Germany. I'm sure Benigni's intentions were noble, but noble intentions don't merit unconditional praise and Academy Awards. Maybe we should feel good for the child that was saved form the horror of his situation, and then maybe we should pity him for his ignorance. I'm not so sure, but I'm not laughing and crying on cue.

The first half shows us a funny part of Guido's story, already a highly witted person with no shortage of optimism, in getting by his life and reaching for his love Dora. The second half displays how Guido, now a father, shields his son from the grieve of a concentration camp, all while always incorporating his wits to get by things, his optimism and enthusiasm to get by with his son's curiosity, and having a fair share of luck that eventually saves his son's life. I rarely see such a movie that can turn its mood from the happy tone into one of a sad tone so drastically, yet the happiness is still there even in the sad moments. The background is of course the classic and usual set of World War II's Europe, but again the developed story takes us to see the war from a very touching angle. Of course there are pot holes and things that don't really make sense, But the story itself is so touching that it belittles the shortcomings.

He uses his wits and lack of any thought of repercussion to get kicks out of the mundane aspects of life. Guido finds comedy his tool to gain anything he needs. He is the exaggerated personification of optimism never failing to find the best out of any situation. The first half of the film shows Guido win the love of Dora, a beautiful and engaged Italian woman. There is nothing realistic about his methods of gaining her attention. There are just perfectly played out coincidences that Guido takes advantage of. It is almost like an embellished story passed down through the years. Guido pulls one over the top antic after another and eventually runs off with Dora. It is pure fantasy.",
98,6 August 1999,bnm81510,5, Begnini is no Chaplin,"There is no subject in the world sacred or horrific enough that it cannot be dramatized for cinema. Holocaust, because it occurred so recently, is deemed an unfilmable taboo by many. Some of the people I know, refused to see Benigni's controversial film out of sheer principle. I resisted seeing it as well, but not because of the nature of its topic. Everything can be approached from many different angles, and in this case, Comedy has the most risk in striking wrong notes with the viewers. At times, Comedy ,particularly in the guise of social satire, can expose truth and even present it in a bold, provocative manner. But a Holocaust comedy? Of course, life in the concentration camp can provide plenty of material for life-affirming sentimentality, but as presented in ""Life is Beautiful"" it is obviously FALSE. This is simply milking a historical event of great importance to modern humanity, for the purpose of luring an unsophisticated audience to admire one's work. Benigni without a doubt makes a talented comic, and the first half of the film, when his big-mouthed character mocks Italian fascism, IS funny, precisely because it's satire. As soon as he and his on-screen son are shipped off to the camp, the object of ridicule becomes less clear. What we get is a soft toned, PG-rated, annoyingly unrealistic treatment of unspeakably brutal conditions, where death and disease prevailed. In a fantasy or a science fiction setting, the duo's exploits could have worked, but to anyone who is aware of history, they would seem implausible. It's surely a noble effort to protect one's child from the terrifying reality by pretending that the whole setting is a game, but unfortunately, had it been a real camp, both father and son would have perished within a week of their ordeal: the later would die of starvation, the former be shot on sight for excessive talking or better yet, silenced by his irritated fellow prisoners. Chaplin, whom the director is often compared to, in The Great Dictator, never even tried to exploit the ""Final Solution""; wisely, he stuck to Hitler and his henchmen. Besides, Chaplin was most brilliant at silent comedy. Benigni, on the other hand, just can't seem to shut up.",

The first act is very different than the second, which is, in my opinion, superior by far. The first act contains too much unnecessary comedy and is not taken seriously. At all. But then there's the wonderful second act. It shows us the love between a father and son and how far a man is willing to go to achieve the happiness of his son. The second act is taken a lot more seriously and I consider it to be excellent. That being said I do think this movie is very uneven, and therefore overrated.

112,25 January 2010,Ziya90,1," The script has some brilliant ideas, but the film is lack of interest, art and even heart","According to some people, Life is Beautiful is one of the best movies of all time, and for some, the best movie of all time, yes, because the movie seems sweet, right? How? There is a family, we watch how the father and the mother meet, oh! how romantic and warm it is. Many people like such things, the meeting stories. Sometimes, it begins with saying in a rainy day... In the first half, we see some superficial slapstick comedy. Comedy is different, tragicomic is different, Life is Beautiful is not tragicomic till the final that shook me a little. It is clearly seen that Benigni inspired from Charlie Chaplin movies, but if you ask me, his film, Life is Beautiful cannot be even ""C"" of Charlie Chaplin movies. People say that the first half is comedy, the second half is tragedy. No. There is nothing devastating or shaking in the movie. Benigni runs after only romance and comedy and little drama, but he does not show anything to us about the conflict or the intensity of the situation. If the story had been told in a different way, with a different mood (tragicomic and serious), it could have been a masterpiece. The idea is brilliant (a father who tries to conceal the (bitter) fact from his little son by saying all this is a game in a concentration camp), but the execution is zero. However, also the movie was excruciatingly boring, I don't know how did it happen, but for me it is the same as Fellini's Otto e Mezzo in terms of lacking interest. The (too heavy?) style including cinematography is lack of effect, lack of cinema feeling, thus the movie is lack of real art and even heart! I couldn't feel anything for the situations of the characters personally and the heartwarming, heartbreaking tone of the film didn't seem me sincere (I mean made for audiences) If you think that I exaggerate too much, please watch The Pianist or Schindler's List again to be sure (both are excellent movies by the way) Roberto Benigni was not the right person for this project I believe. His approach, execution is the same as street theater or child theater which no objection, but for such a story, almost unbearable. Yes, also the movie is not realistic, but it is not important, welcome to this fantasy, an alternative history or an inventive story, but as said, the movie can't carry that great idea.",

It already had an Oscar and the ratings on IMDb were very high, so could it not be great? It was a BIG disappointment! I thought `Life Is Beautiful' lacked consistency most of all. It this movie was a Holocaust fairy tale (!?) for everyone to enjoy, it should have ended with the nazis and prisoners dancing and kissing each other, because `love conquers all'. If it was a comedy, I should have laughed more than twice. And if it was realistic, it would have ended sooner and tragically. Fortunately, my family didn't experience the Holocaust, but I have read enough about it and seen enough pictures, that I can never understand how you cannot be offended by this movie. I think a lot of people don't realize how wrong it is to trivialize the Holocaust, because it doesn't seem real to them. Can anybody even imagine a comedy about 9/11? I didn't think so.

It's disturbing, because I left this film wanting to tell everyone I knew to go see it immediately. Fortunately, credit was given where it was due in this case, and the film got the sort of exposure that no other foreign film has gotten in my memory (I'm 28.) This is not the best film I've ever seen- that honor is still held by The Godfather. It's not the best foreign film I've ever seen- that would be Kurosawa's ""Ran"". It's not even the best Italian film I've ever seen- I still hold up Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"". But it is, without a doubt, a great film. Begnini has a gift for comedic pathos that was previously the sole possession of the late, great Charlie Chaplin. People who profess a problem with the ""realism"" of the concentration camp need only take two things into account- 1.- Have they ever even seen pictures of newsreels of any camps in Italy? I know I haven't- they were always the Polish ones. 2.- The realistic, accurate depiction of concentration camp life is not the point of this film- if that's what you're after, try ""Holocaust"", ""Sophie's Choice"", or ""Escape From Sobibor"" to name only a few. In this case, the story's the thing- a man who so loved his son, and wanted him to feel safe, is able to convince him that the whole situation in the camp is a game. Take the realistic depiction of the camps and the realistic depiction of the settings with a grain of salt and you'll enjoy the film a whole lot more.",

There's beauty in the movie but it's also a bittersweet film. War movies are my least favorite genre however I liked this movie. As I didn't expect what was going to happen the movie had more of an impact. The first half hour was pure bliss. Guido is hilarious and his cheerful personality makes him extremely likable. The scenery was stunning. Everybody was innocent and it was all around fun. Then suddenly it became really dark. I thought the transition was well-directed. Because the first half hour you completely love the characters you keep rooting for them to escape the concentration camp. Every scene either gives hope or scares you that something bad will happen. Guido shows so much strength of character. He never gives into the darkness. You really wanted him to get out of there and get back to his life. It was frustrating to see him be in that soulless place with his family. There was so much suspense. Like the scene with the doctor where you think there's hope but then again it's shown that there really isn't anything you can do in a place like that. Very tragic movie but also beautiful in a way.

142,1 August 2002,Frank-80,1," This movie is an insult to anyone who has experienced the real holocaust, not this contrived, farcical version.","Words escape me!  Perhaps ludicrous, contrived, insulting come close. There is nothing factual about the depiction of the holocaust in this ridiculous, totally unbelievable mess.  Death camps were not nasty places where people toted weights around, got a little dirty but remained shaven, were able to keep their sons not only hidden but alive and well despite a starvation diet, had access to records, phonographs and loud speakers, could basically move about at will and suffer little more than the inconveniences of a run down boarding house.  This movie claims the camp where our heroes sojourn is a death camp, (not one of the thousands of concentration camps that were located throughout Nazi occupied territories) complete with gas chambers and ovens.  There were only six death camps, all in Poland, and all were dedicated, absolutely dedicated, to the dehumanization unto hideous death of their inmates.  Slow agonizing demise from Zyklon B was the easy part; twenty minutes of choking, while clawing at your throat and eyes and it was over.  The devastating removal of every vestige of humanity through constant beatings, lack of sleep, lack of food and water, lack of any semblance of medical care, torments that ate away at body and spirit over endless days, was the intolerable part.  No one ever spoke to a guard without being shot on the spot.  Guido would not have been taken around a bend to be killed, he would have been shot, or beaten to death, or hanged, publically to display for the other prisoners both his impotence and the Nazi's total control over life itself.  It is absolutely impossible for a boy to have been hidden for a day much less weeks in a death camp.  To depict this living hell as a Stalag full of Schultz's, largely ignoring at least one of the inmates, who gets to clean up and wait tables, with his son, no less, is an insult to every person who has been touched by the real horror of the holocaust. This would have been a great propaganda film for Goebbels to have shown to the Red Cross to show how humane the Nazis really were.  If this was meant to work as some laugh-your-way-through-life's-troubles allegory, then a vehicle more appropriate than the greatest genocide ever perpetrated by man against man should have been chosen as the vehicle.  As it stands this movie is a travesty.",

152,3 December 1998,pluis,1, One sure route to the shrink,"La vita è bella sucks. The first half of the movie is mildly interesting and sometimes even funny, but from the moment daddy Guido and son Ferrucio are heading for the concentration camp, director Begnini's hideous master plan takes over. Guido explains to his son that an unforeseen and rather unpleasant truck ride is part of the kid's birthday present. Once they enter the concentration camp, Guido has a lot more of explaining to do. The reason they are here, he tells the bewildered kid, is that a huge game is going on. There are many different ways to score points, and the first contender to reach a thousand points will win the first prize, consisting of a real tank! In order to avoid a one way trip to the gas chamber, Guido orders his son to hide in his bed all day. Now that is real fun! Day after day the kid is running or hiding. All part of the game. Sometimes his father's romantic nature takes over. For instance, he makes an old gramophone blast his favorite love song all over the place, so that his wife in one of the other barracks will know that Guido is still alive and very much in love with her. Happily, at that moment there is obviously not a single German soldier in the camp to shoot this loving soul right through the head. Apart from the whole story being silly and incredible, one may wonder if on the long run it is a wise idea to frame a series of very unpleasant experiences in a kid's life as a game. If he gets out alive - and of course he does - how will he feel later when he discovers that he has witnessed one of the biggest crimes off all time, believing it was all just a game? The answer is: he will feel guilty as hell and, to make things worse, he will think of himself as a particularly stupid and trusting person. If I was a psychiatrist, I would try very hard to have this guy for a client. But Benigni is such a romantic and caring person, that he doesn't seem to realize that sometimes thinking can be a great asset.",

That might only be possible if you go a long way and illustrate what a person is capable of doing such a crazy thing. And this is exactly what Benigni does. Everything Guido does in the seemingly comedic first half of the film, prepares us for how he is going to explain the situation to his son, in the second half. The Schopenhauer-magic trick, the wit to act as somebody, who you aren't under extreme danger, only for the one you love, first his wife, then his son. All this is part of a touching story, which does not need any greasy effects, but tells us about love. In addition to that Guido is so impossibly witty, like when towards the end, he breaks from the camp and tells his friend, Bartholomeu, to meet in Vareggia and open up a steel business. Although the tragedy already being inevitable at this point, I cried tears from laughing. When Roberto Benigni jumps around screaming, full of life, it looks easy, typically Italian. I'm convinced it is not, for it must have been hard work. How hard is it to tell a sad story in a funny way? To find anything funny, regarding the background of the setting, the holocaust.

Roberto Benigni - 'The Italian Treasure House' has probably given to his viewers his best. The story, the performances, the entire theme of a person performing his duties as a husband, as a father is very 'moving' and inspiring.This may be one of the best films ever made. I've never seen a movie with such a balance of hysterical comedy and serious drama. Roberto Benigni totally deserved his Oscars. People on this site have said such negative things about him and this film. Mr. Benigni had a lot of guts to make this film, and there's not another film like it. He handled both the comedy and drama aspects beautifully. I loved the beautiful cinematography, scenery, and the characters.This is one of those movies that have a lasting effect on you. After watching it, I found that it has less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the human feelings and the beautiful relationship of a father and his son. The holocaust provides the ultimate context, that brings and highlights the story and adds yet another deep dimension to the movie. No such piece of art has ever before combined laughter and tears of sadness in me before and that is the miracle of the movie. The realism of the movie is not its strong point, but then again it is not supposed to be; this helps in bringing the audiences to a state of mind away from reality, focusing on the feelings generated by forgetting about all external events and developments of the war. Despite that, the movie does not fail to point out an element of the nazi psychology demonstrated by the doctor who was obsessed with riddles. This portrayed the nazi 'state of mind' (if ever such an expression existed) as a sick mentally disturbed state. Life is really beautiful as you watch Guido's relentless efforts to make a lovely exciting experience of the concentration camp to his son. You get exhausted just watching him going through his painful day and yet you smile as he speaks to his son and makes him laugh. One can go on forever describing the creativity of this movie, but one will not be able to capture all its beauty in writing.",

Sugarcoating the Holocaust just seems like such a bad idea and, while I get what this film is going for with having the light-hearted tone of the first half translate to the second half, the tone is too inconsistent for me to take it seriously. Given all the suffering shown in the second half of the film (not to mention that most of it is shown offscreen, which wasn't the best idea either), I found it hard to feel the cuteness the second half seemed to want me to feel. In one scene, for instance, after Giosuè unknowingly escapes from certain death, the film has a ""cute"" scene between him and his father talking about it, but given the knowledge that the people who didn't understand the rules all died, I couldn't take that seriously at all. Sugarcoating the first half of the film works just fine, but the closer the film moves towards the Holocaust, the more this magic wears off.",

Unfortunately for Benigni, I disliked an entire half of his ""masterful"" feature, and was left perplexed as to how it crumbled into emotional manipulation for the sake of entertainment.

A poor man from the country, he and a friend are going to a metropolitan area to improve their financial situation. On the way to the city, Guido catches a beautiful maiden, Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) when she falls from the second floor of a barn, due to rampaging bees. Each of them looks at the other fondly. Once in town, Guido gets a job as a waiter but, on the way to the restaurant, he loses control of his bike and, once again, smacks into Dora and ends up with his arms around her. This time, he has the courage to ask her a few questions. She is a teacher for the community and, alas, she is engaged. Yet, Guido is not deterred. He arranges to meet Dora at the opera and ""borrows"" a car to take her for a ride. Dora falls hard for Guido but her parents have other plans. Nevertheless, Guido secures her hand in marriage. Flash forward several years. Now, the much-in-love couple run a bookstore and have a young son, Joshua, adding to their great happiness. But, the world is in turmoil, with the rise of Hitler and Mussolini. Since Guido is Jewish, he is eventually captured, with Joshua, and sent to a concentration camp, with gentile Dora voluntarily going along to support her husband and son. Knowing that his son is about to witness and endure unspeakable horror, Guido tells the little boy that they are entering a contest. Whoever can ""play the camp game"" correctly will win a tank. But, in truth, how will the trio survive this situation? Dear viewer, beautiful is far too weak a word to describe this lovely, lovely film. The first half is extremely funny and light, with the Oscar-winning Benigni giving one of the all-time great comedic performances for the screen. Just watch him inpersonate a health inspector at Dora's school or convince a man to order a dinner already rejected by another restaurant patron and you will be smiling so wide, your face will almost break in two. Braschi is pretty and talented, too, as the object of Guido's affections and the rest of the cast is absolutely superb, also, from the young boy playing Joshua to the Nazi camp guards. The scenery is likewise lovely, in the first half, while the setting for the second half is an appropriately horrific concentration camp. The costumes, screenplay, direction, production qualities and, especially, the Oscar winning score by Nicola Piovani are beyond reproach. Yes, the story takes a sad and serious turn but, believe it or not, the humor never stops, even in the face of extreme evil. Naturally, the film has received criticism for the tale's implausibilities. But, it is undeserved, as the movie is a far too beautiful and touching piece of fiction to worry about the ""what ifs"". In summation, if you somehow missed out on a showing of this film, remember ""life is beautiful"" but, it is also short. Do not hesitate another hour before committing yourself to watching one of the most uplifting, humorous, and indeed, beautiful films ever created.",

203,2 January 1999,Tinlizzy,3, The most overrated film of the decade.,"Which is itself an exaggeration, of course. But I cannot possibly imagine how rabbis and survivors of the Holocaust can recommend this movie to anyone. The first half of the film is so achingly unfunny I turned the tape off. Eventually I tried it again, and discovered that the second half turns into a completely different movie. Auschwitz is portrayed as a particularly grubby holiday camp where no one is beaten, the guards never shoot Benigni as he runs around looking for his little boy; people go to the infirmary and come back; and no one starves. I'd say this film plays into the hands of the revisionists who claim that the Holocaust never happened. The Nazis are indeed 'the mean people who yell a lot' since that's mostly all they do. Run Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR to see a truly brilliant film about life in a Fascist state, and then run SCHINDLER'S LIST to find the best fictional portrayal of the Holocaust. They work together about as well as the two halves of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL do. This is a real disservice to the memory of the people who died in the camps.

Writer, producer, director, and star (along with Best Actor honors) Roberto has finally crossed over to mainstream America after so many years of making foreign filmgoers laugh.

Some subtle hints are dropped here and there. ""Guido"", played by Benigni, is half-Italian, half-Jewish and is a waiter.

Also, the movie avoids becoming an expose on the horrors of the concentration camp and instead manages to stick to the story about the family. Instead of moralizing on the injustices and ill-treatment suffered by the hero, the movie presents a story of sacrifice and spirit which remains strong even in the most dire of circumstances. The movie offers a glimpse of the concentration camp from a little boy's perspective. For the little boy, who is too young to understand the true nature, purpose and implications of the concentration camp, the camp is just a bad place. It's only years later that he truly appreciates what the camp was about and how his father's bravery saved his life.",

If the film was a German comedy about the Holocaust would it have won an Oscar I wonder?

I'd give it a nine for the first half.  But then the second half left me horrified.  I suppose it was meant to.  I wasn't expecting it. While I recognize how well made the film was, I just can't see how you can make a film half comedy and half holocaust.  It was meant to make you laugh and then cry, and so it did, so I guess it was a success from that point of view.  But sorry folks, I'd rather watch Johnny Stecchino when I want to laugh and then Schindler's List when I want to see a harrowing story of the holocaust.

242,21 July 2011,nickmesafilms,10, Life is Beautiful (1997-98) - La Vita e' bella: Italian translation,"Italian national treasure Roberto Benigni makes his greatest film ever with the story of making every day into a beautiful day, even if every day is a tragedy. The movie begins as a romantic comedy, where Benigni plays Guido, a charismatic waiter with a desire to make life beautiful, and then he falls in love with the girl of his dreams. Five years later, he lives a happily married life with a new son named Joshua. Then, the movie starts to enter dramatic proportions. Guido's fairytale life takes a serious turn, when he and his family are sent to the concentration camps during the Holocaust, and tries to show his son that this is just a simple game. He wraps up this beautiful message, and makes a beautiful movie called ""Life is Beautiful"". Now I think that since you are reading this, you might think this review is only in Italian. Well, the answer is 'no'. But here's what I have to say about the movie: although the movie was Italian, I can understand the deep and true heart to this story. Roberto Benigni arranges a great script, an excellent score by Nicola Piovani, and also arranges a hilarious performance for himself as the man who makes life beautiful. Also, the comedy in one half of the film, switches to a part of the film that takes place during the Holocaust, and that brings a dramedy charm to it. The film is a great portrait of family, courage, and imagination, and the movie is something I can watch again and again either in English or Italian. ""Life is Beautiful"", in my review, ""beautifully meaningful, and contains a huge heart"".",

It is not necessarily believable but the sheer force of Benigni's personality is enough to allow one to go along for the ride. Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife, plays his wife while little Cantarini does well as the five-year old son who Benigni tries to shield from the horrors of the concentration camp.

However I was greatly disappointed in this movie. As many others have stated, the first half of the movie is very boring. It's also not funny at all. I honestly found Guido to be very, very annoying. I also thought the way he tried to win over Dora was stupid. I mean to be honest, I just did not find him charming, or romantic. He was just not funny. I kept thinking to myself when is he going to get the girl so that all this nonsense stops. The second part of the movie was a little bit better, but not much. I could not stand the way Guido kept telling his son that them being there at the camp was a game, and that he would win a tank. I mean I know you don't want to scare your kids but come on. If I was a child and my father kept telling me stuff like that, I would know it wasn't true. I highly doubt his son was stupid, and I'm pretty sure he had an idea of what was going on. All in all, I just did not care for this movie. I found it slow, with lame attempts at comedy, and it just didn't keep my interest. THis movie did not touch me the way others say it has, and no I don't have a heart of ice, I am actually a very sensitive person. It didn't make me cry.

As astonishing as Begnini was, Edward Norton was still more worthy for the win. In some of my lists and reviews, I say Norton in American History X is the best acting performance in film history, so I knew Begnini would be inferior. I wasn't trying to be stubborn or biased.

The movie takes a sharp turn as soon as the couple gets married. In the 2nd half you can feel the contrast, which has been very well done. Sorrow takes place of laughs but innocence stays throughout especially in the character of the kid. The sensible side of a father comes to the front, who earlier in the movie was more of a clown.

It doesn't make sense to take this risk, in light of his efforts to save his son (which also fall short of believability.) I often am able to suspend my logic in favor of a romantic choice by a character. It is, after all, the movies. But is doesn't even work on that level, since so much time is dedicated to his single vision: save the boy from death or reality! There is no fear of the camp or even death in the film. So, Benigni's character's actions don't have a base in reality. Thus, we cannot feel compassion for the moment, even if we understand that we should feel it. It's the fault of the script and the director, who don't recognize that most of the audience would like the lead to be BOTH smart and charming, to be BOTH brave and funny, to be BOTH egocentric and understanding of others.

Entertaining?- yes; intelligent?- no. And worse, the second half is a terrible tearjerker. I wasn't at all moved by it as everybody told me I would. These two halves don't flow naturally into one another and you get the feeling you switched channels to watch a whole different and not even better film.

The problem is that somewhere in the transition from brainstorm to actual movie the whole thing seems to have lost all sense of direction. Is Roberto Benigni trying to make a statement? Raise some questions? Or is it all an excuse for another overdone ""oh I'm so cute and funny"" performance? Sadly, I suspect it's mostly the latter. Has anyone noticed he won't deal with this movie seriously but rather resort to chair hopping, ""I love you""s and other spectacles? Benigni's refusal to really discuss this movie and some of its more disturbing aspects bothers me. In fact, the whole movie bothers me. It could - and should - have been SO much better. ",

Mental patients belong in asylums, not in power. I guess as a homage to good fathers, the movie is somewhat more tolerable.

I think maybe people like to hear themselves say aloud that they loved a movie with subtitles.","This movie is possibly the most wretched abomination I've ever been forced to endure.  Never was I amused, stimulated, impassioned, engrossed, or even interested.  Divided into two independent halves (which in and of itself isn't necessarily bad), it proceeds to bore and insult the unfortunate viewer with two seperate stories.  The first of these unlikely tales involved a horribly contrived and utterly loathsome tale of a man and a woman falling in love.  Basically, he drags her around the city to various locations where he knows something specific will happen, such as a man tossing a set of keys down from a second story window to a locked-out friend, and she falls in love with him.  Whoopee.  Nothing is done here that hasn't been done a thousand times over in better movies.  The second half amazingly and deftly trumps even the first's diabolical drabness by continuing its utter bore-fest, but then contributing what may be the most insulting, degrading, and unholy storyline ever to grace (or in this case, curse) the screen.  The filmmakers evidently thought it appropriate and amusing to have a good chuckle at the expense of all of those sustained and killed in Nazi concentration camps, as the one in this film is depicted as more of an expensive resort than a death camp.  Of course, there were token scenes that showed a death or two, but never was the horror ever at the focus of the story.  (This may have worked if the picture had anything else going for it, such as a storyline, but sadly such amenities are absent from this stinker.)  I am shocked at the poorness of this movie, and I walked out asking myself something that years of exposure to the supposed decay of society, American pop culture, had never caused me to wonder: ""Is nothing sacred anymore?""",

Even though it is rather controversial, the movie's plot, acting and screenplay are just too brilliant to ignore. It all starts as a pretty lame comedy, but then in the second half it turns into a moving and touching story with some truly brilliant moments. I don't consider this a comedy (the first hour really got me wondering what the fuss was all about), it was much more an emotional movie. There's one scene that kinda sums it all up and makes me lump just thinking of it. To all none Italian people who are not used to reading subtitles: don't let them scare you off.

293,30 December 2006,dcldan,9, Very good one,"Guido is a young-eccentric Italian Jew that begins his life in Toscana. There, with his personal way to live (life is beautiful, there's always place to optimism and to live happy, without hating) he is able to make Dora fall in love to him. They marry and have a child. Some years later, II World War begins, and him, as a Jew, is brought to a concentration camp. There, he will make all the efforts to make his kid to forget all the nightmares of the real life and tries to hide him by telling that this is a game. The movie has two different parts: the first one, a comedy where Benigni shows himself as a clown, and later in the concentration camp, where benigni makes a dramatic part, where, indeed in the worst places, there's time to hope. Very well directed, the film is never annoying and never too childish, nor excessively dramatic. The acting of Benigni is just superb, how, knowing that these are hard times, is he able to seem happy, as he is alive. The soundtrack is also wonderful and the script is very well done, all the scenes have their point and their importance for being there and the two hours it is long seem shorter when you are watching this film. one of the best modern masterpieces, beautiful, interesting, touching, highly recommended to everybody. The only bad point is the fact that the movie is sometimes quite fantastic and far from reality, there are some moments when Guido is in the camp, that, he would have died due to his acts, but he doesn't.

Benigni, without making any political statement, gets closer to the situation and makes this fable an utmost believable one. I've never cried so much watching a film before, especially at the end scene which is a redemption and revelation, of sorts, both at the same time had me in tears and when I learned that there are no more scenes ahead, I was left wiping my tears for a really long time.

308,4 April 2017,sol-,6, Dolce Vita,"'La Vita è Bella' - better known as 'Life is Beautiful' - this Roberto Benigni movie focuses on a free-spirited Italian Jew who pretends for his son that being sent to a concentration camp is part of an elaborate game. One's mileage with the film will vary based on whether one views him lying to his son as benevolent or utterly irresponsible; certainly, the film celebrates his efforts to shelter his son, but he also often places the boy in danger by not letting him know how serious everything is. The film is hampered by a roundabout structure with 45 minutes of childish pranks by the protagonist as he romances his wife to-be before his son is born. Things admittedly pick up well once the son enters the picture, but with slapstick gags beforehand including splattered eggs, it is certainly a bumpy ride. That said, there is a lot of cleverness in how the protagonist manipulates every situation (especially mistranslating a stern guard) in order to convince his son that it is all one big game. There are some very tense moments too, such as when his son accidentally says thank-you. A lot of suspension of disbelief is required though given how many shenanigans they get away with (sneaking off at will; using the concentration camp PA) and therefore it is hard to consider the film very realistic. It does admittedly resonate somewhat though as a tale of fatherly devotion and trying to make the best of bad situation.",
309,20 November 1999,Col-3,7, An interesting movie about a complicated subject,"I think I must be in the very small majority of people that neither loved nor hated this movie. In many ways it was skillfully made and well acted. However, the first half of the movie felt like a wacky romantic comedy with an Italian slant. The second half of the movie, however, is set in (of all places) a Nazi death camp. I happen to believe that if you're going to set a movie in the midst of one of the most terrible parts of history, you want to have something say and to do it very carefully. This movie fails in this, I feel. The message of the movie is very trite: ""The human spirit can triumph over any adversity"" might be a good summary. Rather than being uplifting, though, I found the implausible caperings of Guido and the credulity of his son to be ghoulish and disturbing in a way I doubt was intended by the filmmakers. I'm afraid I can't go along with the premise that the horror of Auschwitz could be covered up with some clever lies and a silly walk.",

I'm sure many will take the same line.  But opening reviews rank this as a must-see.  So.  Must see.  The first point to note is that it takes the best part of an hour before we realise that Roberto Benigni is playing a Jew, which is a reasonable point and makes for happy viewing.  This isn't a north European ghetto.  This is a beautiful Tuscan mountainside village and Charlie Chaplin is centre stage.  But then the storm troopers arrive.  And the chronology is irritatingly wrong.  And the camp is surreal, but in an inappropriately comic fashion.  I felt for Giorgio Cantarini and thought about the lies my father told.",
314,5 November 1998,Jeff-112,1," Okay, but not as great as it might have been.","There seems to be a fair amount of controversy surrounding this film, but after seeing it I have only a bare glimpse of why.  Sure, it is something of a light-hearted tale set in a death camp and one can see why offense might be taken at that premise alone, but the humor is not used to make light of the situation, but rather serves as factor that mitigates the horror for us and for the boy who it is directed at in the film.  I do think that Benigni could have made the death camp scenes darker as that would have made the contrast created by his behavior stand out all the more.  The Nazis never achieve the truly commanding status they must have occupied in reality, instead they come off as dull buffoons which is something that might have been reconciled to create a better film.  But then we must remember the function of the framing device which locates perspective on the young boy, so we have now a tension between what we know of the reality of the situation and the fantasy world that Benigni creates for his son. This is an interesting tension, but it is never drawn out fully enough.  In only one shot do we ever get a sense of the loss of life that was the eventual outcome of these camps, and even then it exists in sort of a dreamscape so it is hard to say whether or not it really existed at all.  If the scenes of Benigni away from his son had contained more horror the film might have been more able to build on the fantasy versus reality theme that seems so crucial here.  Since this is the boy's story, the scenes of Benigni away from him lay outside the realm of his personal memory, so they exist as constructions implying that either the son has extended the cloud of fantasy retro-actively over things he learned about the camp or the filmmakers did not wish to break the aura that they created.  I would tend to think of the latter as a the more probable cause.  Benigni is crafting a fable here and applies a ""fable-istic"" aura to all of the proceedings, but frames the story in the perspective of the boy (post-Holocaust)  thus opening the possibility to break down the wall of fantasy and insert scenes of tragedy that might have made Benigni's act all the more heroic. This criticism aside, there are quite affecting moments in the film.  In the moment Dora chooses the forsake all for her family and follow them to the death camp, Benigni has created a piece of pure, selfless melodrama that illustrates the ties that bound families together in that time.  We know Benigni must die, and thus the scene of his death is oddly unaffecting.  But by pairing it with the coming of the tank at the end Benigni has made both moments all the more affecting.  Life is Beautiful is not a great film.  It might have been, but it never really explores the battle between fantasy and reality that is the core of the film.  Fantasy wins out and reality only makes a few insertions making what could have been a truly uplifting homage to the human spirit somewhat dulled.  Not dulled enough to consign it into the realm of mediocrity however, as there are enough good moments to make this a film worth watching.  Benigni's courtship of Dora is quite sweet, even if I find the Benigni character a bit overblown for this film.",

No concentration camp even remotely resembled what is shown in this film. No child would ever be successfully hidden from those running the concentration camp. Anyone who acted like the character played by Roberto Benigni would have been immediately killed. If Benigni wanted to make a film about a father protecting his son from the evils in the world, he could have invented any situation or set of circumstances he wanted. He certainly didn't have to, and shouldn't have, totally misrepresented this period of time in modern history. For reality, try watching ""The Pianist"". Try visiting the Holocaust Museum.

Shindler's List is the defining movie for its genre, but rather this movie takes for granted that you already know about the holocaust from school, movies, or elsewhere. For example, what else would give you that pit in your stomach feeling when you see Guido's uncle sent to a different line after the train ride. This is not exactly a film about the holocaust per se, but it is a film about a triumph over the holocaust. Yes, Guido dies, but Giosue survives. Guido's sacrifice was a triumph. It is a rare mixture of happiness and tragedy, all in the correct amounts. It is a film that will leave you speechless, save to say ""Life is beautiful.""",

The movie has movement, rhythm, it is a look the holocaust  from the eyes of a little boy, who's dad ""Guido Orefice"" played by Roberto Benigni (Son of the Pink Panther, Pinocchio)  had the most wonderful perspective of life that I ever heard about .The role of dad ""Guido Orefice,"" was  in reality based on that of Benigni's father himself,  which indicated that Roberto inherited his great and awesome humor. That is a precious gift. What a thankful heart! I absolutely loved the movie. There is that famous show business saying:"" to make people cry is easy, but to make people laugh is hard.""  To, I would add if you will, to make people cry watching such a predicament is even harder. There absolutely nothing in the movie that I did not like. I fell in love with every detail. Normally when I buy a foreign film I like to get the original, especially those in Italian which is a language that I understand very well, but I ended up with the English version, even so no complaints, I really, truly enjoyed the movie. My favorite scenes:Guido Orefice on is bicycle, Guido Orefice, his wife and his son on his bicycle. The way he treated the woman he was in love with, always saying: ""Buon giorno, Principessa!""  Guido in front of the students in his undies!  All he did to charm ""Dora""  Nicoletta Braschi (Afirma Pereira; Pasolini, un delitto italiano) the love of his life, and also in real life,  Benigni's wife.

I've heard this movie criticized for its depiction of concentration camp life, but COME ON!  The father's need to protect his child from his surroundings was truly touching. I loved the little boy.

Guido tries to make light of what is a very horrific, nightmarish situation by heavily improvising to his young son by using humor that it is all just a game. The young boy that played the son was brilliant in the role-he is VERY talented. I didn't think the harsh reality of the camp was built up enough in this movie. If they would have put more detail into the horrible reality of the camp it would have made the movie better. Overall it was good and enjoyable. I give it 7/10.",

I am an Indian and I saw this movie in Hindi dubbing. But the language is not a matter of barrier for such piece of art to communicate the mass. The liveliness of Guido till the end of his life is really inspiring. And the depiction of scenario during 2nd world war is very realistic. The movie starts with fun, comedy along with his friend Feroccio and then his romance mix with fun with Dora. The scenario becomes darker when they are kept in jail but still Mr. Guido keeps the movie alive as well as his son from Nazis. The most touching part comes when Guido is taken by the soldiers to kill and he tries to make his son smile for the last time and his promise to his son for the tank is fulfilled when the US army comes. The movie is a comedy with a hidden tragedy. It's a story of a father, his love for his son and for his wife under the shadow of world and the activities of Nazi during the time. We should also thank Mr. Roberto Benigni for such a beautiful piece of art.

He also directs the film, but lost the Oscar to Steven Spielberg, I think he's much more compelling as the actor. Set in the 1930's Italy, the first hour of the story sees friendly Jewish book keeper Guido Orefice (Oscar and BAFTA winning (for acting) actor, writer and director Roberto Benigni) having a fairytale romance. Using his cunning wit he wins over Italian school teacher Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) who was set to marry another guy. He basically makes it out like he is a prince who has found his ""Princess"", and getting the timing right he always shows up, making her smile, until she gives in. Years later Guido and Dora are living together with Guido's Uncle Eliseo (Giustino Durano), and they have a 5-year-old son, Giosué (Giorgio Cantarini), and they all seem happy. I thought the whole film was going to be a happy and charming comedy throughout, but I was wrong. It becomes a gripping drama when Guido and his son are arrested by the Germans and taken away to a concentration camp, with Dora demanding she go too. They are split, but Guido with Giosué wants to protect him from the horrible truth, so Guido tells his son that this is a holiday, and a big game where he has to get 1000 points to win a tank and leave. This lie seems to be very convincing as some of the prisoners and the Germans go the way that Guido expects, and his son does not suspect anything, even with the near catches. When Guido tells Giosué he has 1000 points, he makes him hide while he tries to escape and find Dora, but he is caught, and sadly killed. Thankfully though, Giosué comes out of hiding, a tank really does come with an American (the only English spoken in the film) soldier driving to take him, and he finds his mother Dora, both a tragic and happy ending together. Also starring Sergio Bini Bustric as Ferruccio Papini, Marisa Paredes as Dora's mother, Madre Di Dora; Horst Buchholz as Doctor Lessing, Lidia Alfonsi as Guicciardini and Giuliana Lojodice as School Principal/Headmistress. Real life comedian Benigni is fantastic being funny in the first hour, but also very compelling as a serious actor in the realistic concentration camp environment. Both a great funny film, and a great dramatic film, just a great Italian film. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Music for Nicola Piovani, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Film Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film not in the English Language and Best Original Screenplay.

How does a movie deal with such evil and tragedy which can easily offend an audience? The Pawnbroker (1965) touches upon such terrible experiences in a touching and yet harsh way through the pain of a Holocaust survivor. The death camp scenes in the Pawnbroker are at times not plausible but the emotion of the movie always rings true. Life is Beautiful is also centered on personal Holocaust experiences but the central character could not have been shown in the realistic way of the Pawnbroker. While the Pawnbroker deals with the anger and the trauma of a Holocaust survivor, Life is Beautiful asks the question, is there something more important than survival?",

I anticipated a harrowing couple of hours, akin to watching 'Schindler's List' However, it was the most wonderful, entertaining film.  I had a smile on my face throughout almost every minute, sometimes laughing out loud, often holding back tears.  The sense of love is overwhelming, the comedy all the more remarkable given the subject matter, which has all the more power for the relatively few direct references to it.  (I'm thinking especially of the scene where Guido emerges from fog, talking about how dreamlike it is, to be confronted with a sight which really brings home how nightmarish his condition really is) I really hope that on Oscar night, Benigni will be saying 'Abbiamo vinto!', because this film deserves it more than any of the other nominees that I've seen.

It is about a father and how far he goes to protect his son's innocence from the most horrible evil the world has ever seen. The movie can be split into two halves.

This is a love story about a funny man and a lovely woman who have a son together. The Pre-WWII setting is simply a motif where everything takes place. However, this movie doesn't intend to be a rehashed bashing of Nazi Germany where we have seen in high profile films like ""Schindler's List"", ""Diary of Anne Frank"", and countless other Holocaust movies. These movies had a purpose and it was often to point fingers at those responsible for all the deaths in concentration camps during WWII. ""La Vita a Bella' takes a different outlook and demonstrates how a nice European family fell victim to the political problems and tragedy of WWII. It's a sweet and wonderful film with a good sense of humor. Roberto Benigni was fairly unknown before this came out. But when he accepted his award for best actor, everyone clearly noticed his English was quite shaky. For a guy to win the hearts of the world with his limitations is proverbial. I remember when the cameras panned to the audience and so many people, actors and stars, were crying in joy for his achievement. The end of the movie had me crying my eyes clean as well.

411,17 July 2020,jgcorrea,5," No, it's not a wonderful, Capraesque life","Life Is Beautiful is perhaps the most celebrated film with an inspiring and motivational purpose. At first, it's a kind of mixture between romanticism and hypothetical wishful thinking, with a motivational aura that has little to do with reality, politics, or harmonious social norms.
But a comedy about the Holocaust?... It surely mounts to pure escapism towards nowhere. Schmaltzy sweetness is not exactly romanticism. There are nuances that distinguish pure romanticism from cathartic sentimentality. The sentimentality that affirms La Vita È Bella, as presented, is frankly fake. Benigni makes a talented narrative, but the direct object of his ridiculing led to an indirect, irritating and unrealistic treatment, done in soft tones, with a PG label. The real conditions in the extermination camps were unspeakably brutal. Only death and disease prevailed there. The Holocaust is very recent to not be considered a taboo. In principle, no subject in the world is too sacred or hideous to be dramatized. But I did avoid watching Benigni's comedy until my daughters insisted that I took them. I say, I'm an incurable romantic who was somehow vaccinated against motivational instances.
Movies like AMélie Poulain, American Beauty, Bad Santa, Big Fish, Breakfast On Pluto, Chocolate, The Hangover, Up, Sex and the City, Rushmore, Precious, Koyaanisqatsi, I definitely didn't like them (I even hated some of the more glaring cases, like Motorcycle Diaries for instance, a mistifying apology for false benefactors of mankind)
On the other hand, there were genuine sincerity and romanticism exuded from movies like Groundhog Day, Babette's Feast, The curious case of Benjamin Button, Once, Midnight Express, Midnight Cowboy, and above all from a masterpiece such as It's a Wonderful Life.",

429,13 February 1999,T-10,10, The power of love!,"Let me first say that I don't think Life Is Beautiful trivializes the Holocaust.  Admittedly it uses the stark cruelty and violence of the Holocaust only as a back-drop to love of a father who is desperately trying to protect his son by playing a game which has a comedic outcome to the viewer, but in fact is a deadly game. I'm sure the actual cruelty was also soft-pedalled somewhat so as not to overshadow the father/son relationship.  However Roberto Benigni who co-wrote, directed, and starred in this film makes no doubt as to how he feels about the perpetrators of the Holocaust and mocks them at every turn whether it be his comment about ""Visigoths and spiders"" or the using of the guard at the camp or the shallowness of what appeared to be a sympathetic friend/camp doctor. Chaplin, the Marx Brothers, and even (forgive me) the Three Stooges have all mocked the Fascists.  I believe that Benigni, who is brilliant in all his roles, in this film offers a story of triumph of the human spirit where comedy is only protection for his son. The film also captures the era well and features a strong performance by Nicolleta Braschi as his wife and an outstanding performance by Georgio Cantarini as his son. I will see this film again.

The film is really very low quality. If you want to see a quality comedy about the holocaust, try Radu Mihaileanu's (a romanian director) 'Train of Life'('Train de Vie'), which is some million times better(it was written before Benigni's film(and filmed before, I think), and the script was read by Benigni's producer, who should have produced but didn't, and might as well have 'inspired' Benigni, if you see what I mean.

It was recommended to me by a friend who said it stayed with her long after it ended. I had the exact same experience after watching it. I've seen it several times, and it always has the same impact. The love of the husband and wife is very clear. And the ""game"" that the father creates to protect his son is ingenious. Of course, the main portion of the story is very sad, because you know what is going on and what they are enduring. The ending brings both tears of joy and accomplishment, but also tears of sadness. A bitter-sweet moment. The actors are excellent in this movie, especially Roberto Benigni - which is why he won an Oscar for his performance. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.",

The way in which he tries to protect not only the son's life, but also his mental health, makes Guido the ultimate film father and one of the greatest film heroes of all time. ""Life Is Beautiful"" is the lifetime achievement of Roberto Benigni and certainly one of the most beautiful and the very best movies of all time.",
442,9 May 2021,briancham1994,9, Very touching,"This film starts off as a slapstick romantic comedy which is already quite good in itself with lots of gags, odd scenarios and repeated call backs. The main character is a lovable idiot and borderline stalker but ultimately harmless. We get to know a wide cast of characters and we feel the life of the town. Halfway through, the film turns into a Holocaust drama and we feel the gut-wrenching attempts of the protagonist to act as a good father and help his young son to cope in the concentration camp. The main character is beaten but not broken - a paragon of perseverance, hope and positive fatherhood no matter the circumstances. It's sad, it's tragic, it's uplifting, it's touching, it makes you cry and laugh at the same time!",

445,24 May 2003,Comet-5,10," A superb movie about the power of love between man and woman, parent and child and the lengths to which people can go under even the most horrific, tragic and desperate of circumstances.","This is my favorite film of all times.  It demonstrates the power of love even under the most devastating of circumstances;  the lengths to which a parent will go to protect his child from an overwhelming truth and the imagination it takes to carry this off.  It is absolutely hilarious in parts and incredibly sad in others. The first half and second half are beautifully balanced.  The acting is superb, and the music very evocative, haunting and jaunty as well.  After it was over I was silent for a long time just feeling the experience and thinking about what I had just witnessed.  It brings home the depth (and breadth) of the holocaust by focusing on its effects on one family. I lost over twenty members of my mother's family including my grandparents.  I think this film is a fitting memorial to them",

448,21 August 2003,pfeinman,10," Bittersweet, yet fulfilling.",The most bittersweet of all movies. You wished that Benigni and Vincenzo Cerami had written it so that he would have overcome the German and killed him instead of being slain. But life is not that way.

451,28 November 2002,jefff99999,1, Missing the point,"This was a confusingly awful film.  At first it seems like a rip-off of ""An American in Paris""; the main character falls in love with a girl that's going to get married, and she ends up with him.  There's a bit of clever romance during all this, but it's disturbing how quickly it shifts topic, while remaining very light.  Lots of people seem to think it uses comedy and courage to tell a story.  I think it's irreverently mindless, and skims off the popularity of one actor and the tragedy of war.  I saw a clown, although energetic and somewhat talented, lying to his son who is to dumb to recognize the truth.  He calls his act a sacrifice; it's really just a showcase of physical comedy leading to an emotional void.  This film borders on propaganda, making light of the reality in concentration camps.  Most of it just doesn't make sense, in that with everything that the characters did and went through, they would have suffered much more and probably would have been killed several times throughout the film.  Knowing what they did, no one could be that emotionless or stupid. Comedy and the holocaust are not good partners and Benigni just didn't pull it off with this.  Guido's game with his son came just too easily; it makes you wonder why if WWII was this nice everyone didn't come out as sugary sweet as this.  I'm sure that Benigni is very good as a clown and will be other movies as one, but this wasn't as good as it should be. It won awards for the wrong reasons.",

This is no Schindler's List, it is a story about one man's unending ability to maintain an uplifting and positive outlook on life no matter what. Guido does everything in his power to shield his son from the true horror of what is happening around them, so therefore we (the audience) do not see the full horrors of the Nazi camp either. We see life through Guido's eyes. We see life through his son's eyes. Life is Beautiful no matter what - and that is the point. This is not a factual representation of the atrocities of war, it is a film about hope, about love, about one man's dedication to his family above all else. The fact that it uses the holocaust as a backdrop is not really important, although I can understand why some people see it differently. If you have children, you will understand it straight away.

I feel that Roberto Benigni was absolutely charming, disarming, beguiling, supremely inventive and hugely compassionate in his desire to win the heart of his loved one and then to shield his child from the horrors of the holocaust by game playing.

477,1 February 2000,marchrijo,10," Now, you have to mention ""Benigni"" in a row with Chaplin and the Marx Brothers...","Once, I thought about Roberto Benigni to be a clown, now I know him as a comedian. Comedian, that doesn't mean, an actor, who plays funny roles, but a film-maker, who developed his own style of comic - like in the old days: In importance for movie history to compare with Charles Chaplin (and with the ""Great Dictator"" ), with the Marx Brothers in his sense of humour. Remember the absurdity of the hat exchange! It's the variousity of ideas and running gags, that makes it to one of the best comedies ever. The box, in which Josue is hiding to take refuge from the bath, reappears at the end when it saves from the Nazi troops, Maria's key becomes the key to a woman's heart, the tank is the ambiguous symbol for childhood dreams and warfare fright. The naivity and purity of the message is heart-healing, not ony concerning the horrors of war and concentration camps, but also concerning social and emotional boundaries that love-foolish attitudes commonly may have. It's one of the most beautiful romantic movies ever, too... As to the discussion about jewish fate vs. comedy: The first half of the film is refreshing and a flower of comedy. It seems as if Benigni said at this point, laughing at the audience: Now I show you, of what I'm really able, my comedy can't stop at nothing, because it's not only a nice film, but a mode of living. And he succeeds in a triumphal way: Not a single scene that touches uncomfortable, despite of the severe affairs... I have a new cinema hero.",

With much respect to the critics of his treatment of the holocaust, he managed to convey its brutality to me, ie when the children and elderly were on their way to being ""showered"", the Germans shouting a bunch of harsh sounding and untranslated words, Jews being carried from their homes without a moment's notice...  Those scenes sent chills up my spine.  I really don't think anyone will ever take what happened lightly because of this film, (unless they were predisposed to taking it lightly before they saw it).

Unfortunately though Benigni lays it all on too heavily and broadly. Sure there are sweet moments throughout where it does work and the viewer can feel good about it, but the misses accumulate to a degree that they weaken the whole undertaking.

Basically handling a physically challenging problem. With shear guts and determination you will it through to the end. I'm not talking about playing or participating in a sporting event. I'm referring to the game of survival. Life is Beautiful was a breathe of fresh air to me personally. At this time in my life I was working at a job I dreaded immensely. Director/actor Roberto Benigni adaptation of his Father's Holocaust experience is portrayed in such a tasteful and comical way despite the harsh realities of the Nazi atrocities. This story takes place of course in Italy as slight tidbits of racism appear behind the beautiful backdrop of the Italian ambiance during World War II. My first take on this movie which I watched in Italian (with subtitles in English)Our Star Guido is romancing his love from afar Dora or as he coined her moniker Pricepessa (Princess)played by actress/Wife, Nicoletta Braschi. I thought this movie was going to be about a light comedy filled with slapstick and romance but as I mentioned earlier you see subtle racism with (Negozio Ebraico) spray on random store fronts. Roberto's charm and physical dexterity are slight reminders of those silent screen giants Lloyd and Chaplin. Dora is supposed to be married to a snobbish, full of himself individual. An engagement party is held in the Hotel where Guido works. Dora bored and dubious about her future with this man is instead taken with Guido's charm and laughter. Love the scene with the decorated painted horse which Nazi sympathizers painted racial remarks on the animal.Out of a scene from Sir Galahad Guido rides into the elegant hall breaks up the party as the two whisk away on the steed to the angry potential In-Laws plus Dora's Mother as the center piece goose egg falls and breaks over the Fiance's head. Dora and Guido wed. Five to six years have passed. Enter our third shining star there adorable son Giosi (Giorgio Cantarini). Bright and Cheerful with a wondrous curiosity the boy is down right adorable on the screen. Giosi is a little entrepreneur running the family business(A bookstore) to the delight of Dora's estranged Mother who visits her Grandson for the very first time unbeknownst to Giosi. The relationship between Father and Son is uplifting despite Giosi's refusal to take baths. These are ominous times of war torn Europe. The Nazi now flexing military muscle are rounding up Jews throughout the town. Wife Dora is Christian and is spared but the realty of Guido, his elderly Father and son entering a cattle car north to a concentration camp takes our story into a dark place. Dora tells the Captain of the guard to hold the train as she can't bear being separated from her family. She gets on and sacrifices her freedom just to be close with her family even though she'll end up in a neighboring camp. Upon their arrival the Grandfather is separated and sent to a termination line. Meanwhile Guido makes light of everything around him. Pretending to translate German Instructions from the German Officer in charge of the barracks. Conjuring up a mythical story about a contest involving an army tank telling his son, no matter what, obey his orders or they will lose the contest. The reality of the concentration camps and the Nazi's final solution plans are to kill off the elderly, weak and of course gas all the Jewish children. Guido tells his son to hide to gain valuable points in the imaginary tank lottery. By doing so the boys life is spared. Before all this Guido befriended a German Doctor Lessing played by world renown actor Horst Buckholtz who speaks many languages and has a penchant for riddles. Guido does all he could to keep the boy's mind occupied throughout this incarceration of evil by Nazi occupation. Just a moving story about how far a Father will go for the love of his child.",
501,1 December 2002,sing4him28,10, I watched it at a very low time in my life and it picked up my spirits.,My daughter rented this movie and recommended that I watch it. She loaned me the tape. I never really appreciated foreign films because of reading all of the sub titles. But I stopped and rewound the tape at certain scenes in order to get the most out of it. I realized that this can not be done in a theater. I was touched by the characters in this film. I highly recommend it. I watched it at a very low time in my life and it picked up my spirits. I hope that it will do the same for others.,
502,15 February 2016,pratyush-03848,10, You learn to appreciate those around you after watching this movie.,"Life is Beautiful is an Italian film that released in 1998 in USA. It is the story of happy-go-lucky Jewish man named Guido who is married with a son. The story is set in World War II in Italy where the Fascist Party is in power. And during the course of the story, Guido and his son are taken to a concentration camp. What Guido does to keep his son safe forms the rest of the story. Roberto Benigni plays Guido, the loving doting father and husband to perfection. His performance makes it so easy for us to love his character and to cheer him on. His son in the movie, played by Giorgio Cantarini, is also exceptional. After watching this movie, I was moved by how much Guido works to make sure his son is fine. It made me appreciate a father's role in a family more. All in all, this is a film that no one should miss. I recommend that you watch it whenever you have the time and after watching this movie, I believe you will appreciate your fathers more.",

All three are great films, but the fact is that LiB is more touching than either of the others.  Schindler's List does not focus on the smaller characters enough for us to be emotionally involved with them, but we care about Guido, Giosue and Dora.  The Great Dictator is also a great dramatic-comedy about WW2 which touches on the Holocaust, and is a fantastic movie, especially when we consider that it was made in 1940.  This film, however, focuses on dictators and war, rather than the holocaust.  LiB creates human characters that we love and care for, and so the experience of watching it is truly touching.",

The performance of the R.Begnini and the child can't be better. Dora is great too, except for the situation of the car when R.Begnini surprises her in her boyfriend's car, her expression is very poor, except for that, her performance is excellent.

Second, Roberto Benigni performs outstanding in the movie. The movie consists of two distinct parts. In the first part, it depicts a romantic relationship between a lighthearted gabbler named Guido (Roberto Benigni) and a teacher (Nicoletta Braschi) in Italy of 1939. Here, the movie is slow-paced giving the viewer almost no clue about what will become of the lead characters. However, in the second part, the plot makes a 180-degree turn. A few years after their marriage, Nazi soldiers capture the family and take them to a concentration camp. Guido makes every effort to make his son feel comfortable in the camp.",

528,8 September 2013,jchodyka-712-409893,9, Not at all about human evil,"Those who accused the movie of lack of realism missed the point. This masterpiece was not about Holocaust and its atrocities but rather this theme served as allegory for something so sadly rare that in order to show it the director had to use this controversial subject in a comedy. I am talking about something called ""human spirit"" although I don't like this phrase as it became slowly a cliché. I am Polish and had a few relatives who experienced concentration camps - some of them survived - one didn't. I also lived 100 km from Auschwitz which became sort of a destination for school field trips. On top of that - in schools we had an extensive course on camp literature and let me tell you that your typical Holocaust movie is not especially realistic either. The problem I have with those movies is that it shows always similar narrative: diabolical German guards (chosen from criminals), victims so sick and emaciated, and super obedient due to hunger, illness and extreme fear that you could not find the shred of humanity in them. Other people, outsiders, did not nothing because conveniently didn't know. Camps were super isolated so only a few could be blamed - that is typical narrative of movies which makes people feel good. After all: we are not so bad, it is just a few of us. As to camps: image of prisoners are totally inhuman which is probably the biggest injustice to those who suffered and died. But death, torture,hunger was just part of the camp experience, huge no doubt but not the whole truth about those places. There was camaraderie, help, compassion,medical attention done by prisoners doctors (some hanged for this),acts of incredible courage (Jan Karski, priest Kolbe)... And if you want to know how it really was like being there read Tadeusz Borowski's: ""This way to the gas, Ladies and Gentelmen"" or ""Men's search for meaning"" by Victor Frankl. Yes, it was abyss but people reacted differently. Many became a part of killing machine, many gave up any struggle for survival but few remained humans despite hell. There was even humor, nightly reading stories by some writers, teachers inmates without books, some sort of lectures, art performed with coal, games done with sticks or balls made of rags and yes - there were some attempts at saving small children although rarely successful. What I am trying to say that clichéd, tired image of big cruel guards, sheep like prisoners walking in mud,slowly,in perfect order towards death without any protest, piles of corpses really say nothing about Holocaust. It only desensitizes viewers and pose a threat that it will be forgotten by younger generation, or perhaps even repeated. Before extermination camps were built there was the whole decade of injustices, watched by the Western world with indifference , which started small but slowly precisely because of lack of reaction from the World, snowballed to gas chambers. If you don't believe it could happen now. Just listen to people with their stupid simplistic explanation to complex problems. I heard statement from so called decent people that in the light of recession and lack of jobs for born citizens all foreigners, including their children should be deported to their countries. Here you go. That is how it starts. And Roberto Benigni made movie so original, so different from other of this sort that said more about humans that all other films combined. combined.",

His humour and happiness provide the strength they all need during what must have been an horrific period in their lives and history. Despite the horrors all around them, the subject is handled in a way that doesn't shock or detract from the story, which is ultimately about the strength of love, and the refusal to be broken by negative forces.

All falling on top of a death that shocks something inside that tears don't begin to roll when you would expect them to but eventually have their way with you when you see this little boy's face light up over something he does not even understand and then the ever so powerful reuniting of the family brings a wonderful climax of emotion.

While Fascist forces grow in power around them, he woos her with magical imagination; so shamelessly sincere in his earthly motivations that at times he seems to levitate while expressing himself. He even rides a horse into her engagement party to rescue her from a loveless union with a hulking fascist bureaucrat, as we witness his romantic honesty transcend every spastic goof he involuntarily makes.

564,23 February 1999,han solo-4,10, LA VITA E BELLA DESERVES TO WIN BEST PICTURE OSCAR,"La Vita e Bella is an extraordinary film. Not many films can make you laugh as much as you cry - but this certainly is one of them. Roberto Benigni (the Robin Williams of Italian cinema) is wonderful in the lead role and has done a fantastic job with the directing and script, too. His real life wife, Nicoletta Braschi, is great as his wife who, although she herself is not Jewish, demands to be taken to the camp with him. Credit must also go to little Giorgio Cantarini who is brilliant as Giosue (Joshua), Benigni's son, who he tries to shield from the horrors of the holocaust. The film starts in typical slapstick Benigni fashion in 1939 Italy as Guido and his friend Ferruccio go to Arezzo, a Tuscan town. On the way, Guido meets Dora, a schoolteacher, and falls for her. Once they arrive in town, Guido and Dora meet again on a number of occasions, each time Guido surprises Dora - his ""principessa"". Although Dora is engaged to another man, he still fights for her and eventually wins her over in a memorable scene which uses so many set pieces that have been set up in the previous 30 minutes. The film continues 5 years later and now Guido and Dora are married and have a little boy called Giosue. This is where the film begins to get a little dark as Giudo, Giosue and Dora are taken to a concentration camp and the men and women are seperated. Guido pretends to Giosue that it is all a game and that they must obtain 1000 points to win the prize of a real tank. Schindler's List was a very powerful film and had very graphic scenes portraying the holocaust. Benigni does not show as many graphic scenes but you can still feel the pain and suffering. La Vita e Bella should win the Oscar for Best Picture - but unfortunately I don't think it will as Hollywood is bound to overlook the most powerful, funny and emotional film of all the nominees.",

He fortunately survived, and Roberto Benigni's film isn't far away from that in terms of approach to the subject. it's arguably my favourite war film, due to the unique perspective of the little boy (Giorgio Cantarini) and the gruesome reality that's about to crush him, where his father (Benigni) does his best to prevent him from the horrors of the Holocaust and protect him by turning survival into a game where the boy gets to win a tank if he behaves properly. The viewer is unable to ignore the repercussions of the situation in which the story is unfolding, yet Benigni's direction make the hot potato of the topic at hand much easier to handle. Nicola Piovani's emotional soundtrack hit the right nerve without descending into pathetics. Benigni won two Oscars, which were very well deserved. When he got up to the stage, the great Sophia Loren handed him the award, hugged him and broke down in tears, which is a scene that resonates with me even today. He dedicated the Oscar to ""those who gave their lives so that we can say la vita e bella"". It' impossible to stay cold to that. Bravo, Benigni!",

I realize that many people will find Roberto Begnini extremely annoying, the storyline ridiculous and the filming typically chaotic Italian style, but I don't care.

The film's highlight is one man's battle to keep the ugliness of the world from his innocent son, no matter how ugly the world might be, and in this case that means the death camps of the Nazis.

But really, if you're expecting a life-affirming comedy about how the power of love can overcome the most cruel and unfair circumstances... you may be disappointed.

He shows what belief in yourself can do when trying to get something you want and in facing difficult situations that are beyond our control. If you are watching the movie with subtitles you become so entrenched in the plot that you forget that you are reading them. This movie moves at a nice pace.

It's no secret that Benigni is the spiritual successor to Chaplin (and Keaton as well) but he has now made a film that is worthy of Chaplin. In fact, while Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR is uneven - thanks to it being ahead of it's time - Benigni has managed to complete the work and convey the message that Chaplin attempted valiantly with that film.

Brilliant filmmaker and actor Roberto Benigni tries to protect his child from the horrors of World War II and the German Nazi's overtaking of him, his family, and every Jewish person in between.

There's no movie I have ever seen that could make you laugh and cry at the same time. Not a false move in the whole picture, nor a poor dialogue. The acting is superb and the direction is great. Don't listen to the criticism about how the holocaust was lightened in this movie. I do not agree with that, but feel exactly the opposite. After watching this movie you ""really"" get the idea that the war was awful and I don't think anyone could come out of the cinema laughing.

I think the point of this movie was to portray the importance of love and thoughtfulness and to show how strong and selfless people can be with love.
Sometimes, trusting someone is not easy. Loving someone is very difficult. But Guido was not afraid of any risk that he had to take in order to show how much he cares about his wife and son. He always gave his first priority on people he loves, not on himself. He never forgot to make his wife and son laugh even he is in a very hard situation. Such his selfless and thoughful character made me rethink about what love is. I felt like this story was telling me not to be afraid of devoting all my heart to people who I truely care about.

Unlike any other world war II movie, the film is a dark comedy that takes on the history of world war II in a new and unconventional way. Roberto bernini gave all those wounded in world war ii an injection of painkillers from his own perspective.
""Life is beautiful"" is not a tragedy, and Guido's hilarious appearance at the beginning shows that director Roberto wants to create a comic atmosphere, but definitely not to undermine the film's ideological content for the sake of kitsch. In fact, on the contrary, benini did this in order not to fawn on the vulgar, in order to express the deeper thought, not to let the audience indulge in the shallow touch.
Benini just wanted to tell all the people who really love life through this film, the nightmare is temporary, believe that the beautiful life is forever. Even in the camp, Guido kept a smile on his face.",
635,6 January 2006,kgm3,9, A truly amazing film,"Life is Beautiful is a completely original depiction of the Holocost, filled with dark humor. When I first heard that there was a comedy of the Holocost, I was extremely against the idea. I though it would minimize the importance of the event and make it appear trivial. But it isn't making fun of the Holocost, and the extreme light hearted humor actually adds to the tragedy of the story. Benigni delivers an amazing performance as Guido, a care free, creative and playful individual you instantly adore. We watch him win the heart of the woman of his dreams, successfully open the bookshop he always wanted, and have a kid. Then, because they are Jewish, they're sent to a concentration camp. But Guido makes sure his son doesn't know they're in real danger, telling him it's a game, and being careful to always hide his suffering. He continues to be hopeful and funny, and that's what makes the tragedy of the Holocost so real. We see Guido create a Beautiful life for his family, then we see the Nazi's destroy it. The difference in the lives of Jews before/after Nazi's is clearer here than in any other Holocost film I have seen. Guido's attempt to keep the illusion of beauty alive for his son is, to me incredibly inspirational. Life can be, and should be Beautiful.",

Roberto Benigni paints the beautiful picture of a father who, though he is aware of reality, builds a fantasy around his son so that he might not have to suffer as he suffers, and also in order to save his life. Though it is important to live in reality, there are times where it is unnecessary, or it can even be healthy to escape it.

641,29 January 2021,judemcrobbie,9, Benigni is insane in this role!,"Life is beautiful is not a movie I've really heard of before I watched it, but am I glad I did.
I think it is a good movie, however Roberto Benigni's performance as Guido puts this movie with the greats. It is hands down one of the best performances I've ever watched. He basically plays 2 different characters throughout the movie. At the start he is this man who with do anything to get the girl, to a caring father doing right by his child. Sadly the time jump doesn't pay off and his character shifts too quickly. Benigni does incredibly well to bridge these 2 roles and still creates bucketloads of empathy for his character but sadly it seems almost missed potential. And I can't believe I'm saying that about this incredible role as how good it is.
As alluded to, it creates emotion in spades from all the cast. The emotion is so easily portrayed and seamlessly throughout the movie I'm sure even without subtitles I'd get the message.
My only problems with the movie are the basically separate first half and second half, the unabridgement (that's definitely not a word sorry) and the death at the end is done terribly to the point where we aren't sure if it happened.

This movie is categorized as a drama, however, I believe it would be better described as a compound love story. It is the story of a man's love for his wife and son. Refreshingly, it's also about the man's love for life in general. He approaches every situation with a positive attitude and conquers his goals, no matter what is at stake.

674,21 December 1998,irfan-2,10, Extremely enthusiastic,"I can't remember the last movie that moved me in the way this film did. Even today, several weeks later, I can hear Offenbach's Baccarole sing out across the camp creating indescribable beauty amidst the greatest ugliness this world has known.  The simplicity of the script, of the direction, and of the cinematography should be a lesson to all aspiring filmmakers on how to let the story dominate rather than the storyteller.  Robert Benigni, thank you for a delightful film.  And, to the rest of the world, Bongiorno principasa.",
675,9 January 1999,Edward-18,10, A film to be treasured,"Spare no effort to see Roberto Benigni's LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, a film so powerful its weakest aspect could derail a stationary freight train.  At its conclusion audiences have probably rushed out of theaters to sign up for Italian courses in an effort to absorb more of this masterpiece during subsequent viewings.  In Los Angeles and New York Martin Scorsese is presenting a Beningni film retrospective titled, ""Beyond 'Beautiful'""; lovers of first-rate films unable to show their appreciation of Benigni by attending the festivals should be tithed to help keep this Olympian film maker going.",
676,12 August 2019,victorscarelli,10, Such a touching movie,"This film is special in many ways. A great sample of love, perfet amount of comedy that made me laugh all the way, but also it doesn't idealize the reality, going in the opposite direction of hollywood movies.",
677,1 March 1999,rcaccio,10," Best film of the year, but it won't win much - and that's ok","After having read all of the comments here, I don't want to seem redundant with my praise. Having rated it a ten myself, I must say that I heartily agree with all the superlatives mentioned by so many others...and yet, all of it taken together still doesn't seem to do justice to the film. For me, the comparison to Chaplin is right on the money, this film stands right next to `City Lights' for its `laugh out loud' comedy, and its `hurts so bad', but joyous, tears. The final frames of both films are absolutely devastating, although for far different reasons. And both films are the product of each one's singular vision, which is what makes `La Vita e Bella' such a refreshing change from the `by the numbers', focus group driven style of contemporary American films - like you can imagine some Hollywood bigwigs getting behind a storyline like this! (What! No special effects! No sex! No violence! No Cursing! No teen appeal! No old TV sitcom rip offs! - you get the idea. I doubt that this film's whole budget could have kept the `Titanic' crew on set for more than a day.)  In my humble opinion, this is by far the best picture of the year, but I doubt that it will win much more than token `Oscars', which is as it should be. The Academy Awards are Hollywood's self congratulatory party, and this understated, haunting, lyrical,  and profoundly moving gem stands in opposition to all of Hollywood's recent excesses. As for me, I'll take `Life is Beautiful' over a dozen `Titanic's' any day.",
678,18 February 1999,hvrosen,10, A true masterpiece for interesting reasons:,"I never imagined that a film could reach so deep into my heart, communicate so much laughter and at the same time hurt so much. And neither the laughter nor the pain was due to manipulation, but to compassion and true empathy. At the surface this film might be beautifully surrealistic, but that seems to be merely the attractive language, the vehicle used to transport something really essential about life and hope and love.",
679,11 January 1999,Emerald_,10, Best film of 1998!,Definitely the most moving film I've seen this past year.  The film engages your emotions.  Roberto Benigni was magnificent - and so was the supporting cast.,
680,16 October 2007,tony-farah,8, Human Love,"In my opinion, this film is all about Love. Human Love. The special kind of Love a father has to his son. After seeing this movie, I understood more about this human faculty called Love. I understood that Love is a distortion of reality only Humans are capable of. This father distorted and twisted the awful unbearable reality of being captivated in a concentration camp. Why did he do that? For his son not to be scared? Maybe. I think he did it so that his son does not live in hatred which is self destructive and for his son to find joy in the most awful of situations. The thing that moved me the most is that until the very last moment, the father continued playing the game of twisting the reality preserving the emotions of his son. The lesson learned from this movie is that ""Imaginary"" is necessary to beat unbearable reality and it is even better when it is done for others ...That's love.",
681,28 February 2017,moonpop,10, Perfection,Simply the most beautiful film I've ever seen. I have watched this movie upwards of 20 times and will continue to extol the virtues of this cinematic masterpiece to whoever will listen. Such a roller-coaster of emotions and has something for everyone. Worthy Oscar winner.,
682,13 January 1999,didier-2,10, The Movie of 1998,"This movie is a masterpiece. We can compare it to Chaplin's Dictator. But it is a more modern version of the nazism critic and good way to show the horrors of the holocaust. Roberto Benigni is a marvelous actors, even good in sad moments than in happy moments of his movie. Every children in the world should see this movie. (not only this one of course)",
683,20 July 2008,starman2765,9, Definitely worth seeing,"Definitely a great movie, worth seeing. Very funny, and horrific; not in a Clockwork Orange kind of way, rather, like slapstick, jokes and slapstick. The horror of the movie unfolds as the protagonist is slowly revealed, and we see that it is told from a distance of many years. Presented as a story remembered, it could fall into a trap of too much artifice or sentimentality. It doesn't even get near that line, dealing with the horrific overtones implicit in the plot with restraint. I give this one thumbs up! Plot Synopsis: The story begins with the story of the protagonist's father, and how he met his mother. He was a Jew, and she not, in prewar (WW 2) Italy. His father is very fond of humor, slapstick and joy. He wins his wife away from another gentile. The boy protagonist is born into prewar Italy, and then we fast forward to the time period when Jews were rounded up and killed. The protagonist's father makes believe that it's all a game to the child, who is at just the right age to make it believable that he would swallow such nonsense hook line and sinker. They (all three main characters) are interred at a concentration camp; where they manage to stay alive until the allied forces come. Except that the father dies saving his child's life. Did I mention that this is a really good movie? You could rent it tonight, and have some real eye opening fun.",
684,13 September 1999,Bob-355,10, A Brilliant piece of motion picture art,"I see a lot of movies and not many can be described as art. Well, this one definately qualifies. The story of a man's love for his wife and son has so many facets that a 1000 words would not be enough to describe it. I thought the acting of Cantarini was excellent. This young man was casted to a very high standard of performance. I could compare it to Anna Paquinn in The Piano, only better. The story could indeed be compared to Schindler's List in that one gets to see the picture from the victims' side, without the war being the centre of the plot. I felt that the lesson to be learned here was that one can rise above one's life situation and problems. You saw how heavy those steel things were that Guido had to carry and how tired he was. But, for the sake of his child, he stayed positive and focussed on calming the child. Guido gave the ultimate sacrifice of love, namely his life to his family. This scene must be one of the most intence I have ever experienced. One wishes he would come out from behind that wall and laugh in your face and tell you like Jim Carrey would that it is only a joke, but he doesn't. He shows us that life is beautiful indeed, if one strives to make it beautiful and be willing to share that beauty with people around us.",
685,4 April 1999,boogie-7,10, Acclaim to this year's best movie.,"What a treasure. Roberto Benigni has taken us back to the wonderful ""Chaplin humor"". He even took us one step further and lets us cry. This movie about World War II is this year's best picture. Never before have I been touched by a movie in such a tremendous way. What makes it so incredibly sad is the fact, that you have been laughing, living and experiencing beautiful things with the main character. He becomes a perfect figure to identify yourself with. That's why it is a lot more sad and touching to feel his pain. Roberto Benigni's character always tries to see everything from a positive way for him and his son, even though he isn't always well up. But he lets us be happy that we aren't in his situation and he lets us know that life is beautiful.",
686,1 February 1999,jakewood,10, Stunning Film,"Roberto Benigni is a cross between Charlie Chaplin & Harpo Marx.  His pratfalls, mannerisms & facial expressions blend the two as if he is related to both.",
687,7 February 1999,Daniel-67,10, The film of the year.,"La Vita e Bella is the best film I have seen in 1998. I rarely see a film more than once, yet this is a film I could see over and over, each time gaining something new. I really enjoyed the warmth and comedy and genuinely laughed out loud (along with many other patrons in the cinema).",
688,1 March 1999,Scooter-46,10, A great film,"Some great films depict reality.  Others depict reality through the eyes of someone who doesn't quite see it as it really is.  I just can't get over how this film got to me.  The entire audience broke into spontaneous belly laughs at some parts, and when I left I had the impression that everyone else was as angry as I was.",
689,29 April 2020,DemonKiki,9, Classic and warm,"The director beautified all the black acts and processes, and made these  more profound with kindness and beauty. The whole film does not have a positive description of the war, it is only a story about a family. The film uses the unexpectedness of this happy family, and the hard work of the parents reflects the cruelty of the war. Just as the child finally excitedly told his mother ""won"", he did not know that his father had left. At that moment, I saw the pain, tolerance, struggle and hardship of a father, including all the people in that era.",
690,23 February 1999,cutie-10,10, This extraordinary picture should win the Academy Award,"Life is Beautiful is a true masterpiece, depicting what family, love, and hope really is.  Joshua, Dora, and the beloved Guido, have a wonderful and intimate relationship, and one that will never be torn apart.  As a 15 year old, this movie moved me and helped me reflect upon Judaism and made me proud.  Benigni directed this movie beautifully, combining a comedic beginning with a dramatic, sorrowful, yet hopeful ending.  The scene with Guido translating German was gorgeous, and had the theater laughing tremendously.  Joshua is a skilled young actor, and Dora plays a great role as well.  This was a pleasant movie, Rova!!!",
691,17 May 2020,o-43050,9, Beautiful Life,"Even in the most difficult and darkest days, even if there is no hope, death is near, he still loves and protects his wife and son with life and wisdom. His courage and wisdom, even in the smoke of war, even in the dark days of the concentration camp, even at the moment when the last gunshot sounded death, still dazzled with dazzling light.",
692,13 March 1999,FemTiger,9, One of the best movies I've ever seen,"For those who have critcized ""Life is Beautiful"" for ""making light"" of the holocaust have missed the whole point of the film. The film was not intended to be a documentary of sorts about what horrors that were inflicted in concentration camps. The movie is about love and making the ultimate sacrifice for that love.",
693,14 February 1999,lalia,10, WONDERFUL!,"This movie was a film of story, substance, not glitz, not special effects. I always hold a higher admiration for films such as these because they don't depend upon technology to give them good reviews or backbone to the film (such as Titanic or Saving Private Ryan)....the story stands on its own.",
694,15 February 1999,allstar,10, Most Excellent watching,"i'm not one to dig many movies, so my word is bond here :). this was an *excellent* film--without giving too much away i would say that the cinematography is beautiful, the store is even more beautiful...i was not sure at the first 10 minutes if i would really get into the humour of the film (and the subtitles bugged me the first 5 minutes since i've never seen a subtitled flick on the big screen before), but after about 30 minutes, i was captivated by Guido's character, his life, energy and love for his family, and at the very end i just burst out in tears...i didn't realize how affected i was. i came in not knowing what to expect at all, and believe i came out of the film changed in some way.",
695,20 January 2023,javierwinstondiaz,4, What next?,"It's crazy to me that this film is so beloved. Can you imagine making a wacky movie about other tragedies? Perhaps a father and son are on one of the planes that's involved in 9/11, and the father lies to the son and says it's all a game? If that sounds offensive to you, then guess what - it is! Now take a second to think about this movie - I have no doubt that everyone involved had good intentions but there shouldn't be a light-hearted take on any tragedy, whether it be the Holocaust, slavery or 9/11. Some things shouldn't be trivialised, because doing so minimises the actual suffering that the victims and their loved ones had to endure. No one in any of those situations would have been able to suspend their disbelief that it was a game. Presenting it as otherwise, even when dressed up as an inspirational tale, is misguided and disrespectful to the pain they were forced to endure.",
