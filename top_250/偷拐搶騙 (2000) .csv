0,24 August 2004,FilmOtaku,9, There are few films that can make me laugh like this one can,"`Snatch', written and directed by Guy Ritchie is by far one of my favorite films of all time Â– it is easily in my personal Top Thirty.  In the film, about (what else?) several schemes that happen to go very wrong yet manage to intertwine and (for better or worse) resolve themselves in the end, Ritchie assembles one of the funniest cast of characters in recent memory. Let's see if we can keep this straight:",/

2,14 January 2001,Shiva-11,8," Lock, Stock, and Many Smoking Barrels","The release of Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" in 1994 prompted a schism in the staid gangster movie genre: the standard hallmarks - serious characters, gunfights, intrigue and damsels in distress - were enhanced with snappy dialogue, and gallows humour.  The biggest change however was the introduction of the mobius strip-style plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail.  Inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantino's success, but it wasn't until 1998 when Guy Ritchie, an unknown British director, took on the challenge that a successor was found.  Now Ritchie is determined to prove that his first time out wasn't a fluke.",e
3,23 December 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, The pinnacle of Guy Ritchie's career,"This sleek, stylish and very effective black comedy-cum crime thriller is an excellent movie, and one of those rare 'perfect' films where it would be difficult to spot one flaw let alone a number. A follow-up to Guy Ritchie's powerhouse debut, LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, this sees the director in familiar territory with a haphazard plot involving a stolen diamond and an Irish gypsy boxer. It doesn't make much sense, there's no story, but what you do get are hundreds of twists and turns and confrontations, some absolutely hilarious scenes of comedy (anything with the dog in it is a classic) and tons of class acting and class actors.",v
4,7 March 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9, Subtitles A Must To Really Enjoy This,"I would imagine viewers would either really love this movie or be totally turned off. It is presented in a different format for its time (since copied), has very odd and profane characters, accents that are difficult to understand, and tells an unpleasant story with some disgusting scenes. So, why do I enjoy this film, being an old-fashioned so-and-so?",i
5,3 September 2000,SpudMons,10, A Comedy Masterpiece,"""Snatch"" is fantastic; and not least because it demonstrates emphatically that the British movie industry is capable of rivaling even the best of what Hollywood can offer.",e
6,21 January 2001,Keyser Soze-12,9," Just as much fun as Lock, Stock. Snatch is a great and entertaining movie.","Imagine what would happen if you took 8 or 10 criminals of various professions, threw them into a maze, gave one of the criminals a diamond the size of a fist, and yelled out load, ""SOMEONE IN THIS MAZE HAS A HUGE DIAMOND!  WHOEVER FINDS IT AND IS THE LAST MAN STANDING, WINS!"" What do you think would happen?  Snatch is what happens.",w
7,26 August 2004,marty_666,10, Do You Know What Nemesis Means?,"I was never really too keen on ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"".  All my friends constantly quoted it, raved and ranted, and then when ""Snatch"" came out, everyone made an even bigger deal of that.  I watched Lock Stock, and though I did like it, it didn't really tickle my fancy.  But Snatch, that's a completely different story all together.",/
8,28 August 2000,willeniams,10, Guy Richie and Vinnie Jones have done it again!,"Guy Richie's follow up to Lock Stock and Two Smoking barrels is every bit as astonishing as its predecessor. The humour is better and I have never seen people in a cinema laugh as loud and as frequently as they did here. Vinnie Jones plays a similar role as Big Chris, here as Bullet Tooth Tony. His appearance is limited but boy does he make an impact. Even when he is not on screen there is much to savour from Dennis Farina as Avi and a trio of pawnbrokers who are sent to rob a bookies. Brad Pitt sheds his movie start personna and preforms impressively as an Irish gypsie. Unlike Lock Stock.. the humour will appeal to all nationalities. However they mind some slang expressions such as Pikey and blag hard to understand. Good preformances, fantastic characters, razor sharp diologue, expert direction and camera work and brilliant humour, Snatch will make you laugh more than any other movie this year. See it now.",r

10,5 July 2015,hitchcockthelegend,8, In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary... come again?,"Snatch seems to be one of those spunky British gangster films that critics are divided on, yet it's loved by the target audience. Guy Ritchie has done a Sam Raimi, he has remade the first film that put him on the cinematic map. Where Raimi remade The Evil Dead, and just called it Evil Dead II, Ritchie cheekily tries to get away with remaking Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and calling it Snatch. Sure the circumstances in plotting are different, and there's a big American star brought in to beef things up for the global market, but it's the same movie and without doubt it's lazy film making. But it still - like Evil Dead II - Rocks!",4
11,27 December 2020,auuwws,9, Snatch,"A very interesting movie, the black and gypsy people in the film were very funny, Brad Pitt created a movie. This is a Russian character who was enjoyable especially the scene of her death, the film villain could have used better, most of the comedy scenes in the film were funny I really enjoyed watching it",4
12,14 March 2020,meaningbird,10, Might be my Favorite Movie,So I just saw Snatch and it might be my favorite movie I've ever seen. It is filled with so much fun and funny moments that it made the film so enjoyable to the point where it made me want to write a full review for it. All the cast is great and play their roles really well. The film's comedy is probably the best part about this film. My stomach hurt from laughter because of how funny this film is. This is the end of the non-spoiler section of the review. Another Great part of this movie is the great plot twists especially the one near the end.,4
13,14 April 2010,GirishGowda,10," For Every Action, There's A Pikey Reaction!","I saw Sherlock Holmes a couple of months ago and it was very good. I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed that and my friends were raving about Guy Ritchie's style of film-making. So, now I wanted to see Ritchie's previous works & rented out Snatch as it was 135 in the top 250 of IMDb. I have to say I was very impressed. I didn't want to know anything about this film beforehand as it takes away something from the experience and told my friends to shut up about the plot of Snatch. This was Jason Statham's second film, he was not so well known and Brad Pitt was already a superstar. This is one of the best films out there and I totally agree with IMDb users.",8
14,12 August 2013,planktonrules,9," Good, but it's not a film for most folks....","My summary sounds a bit vague, so let me explain. ""Snatch."" is a very, very, very bloody and violent film. It also has a lot of very rough language and a bit of nudity. So, it's obviously not a film you show your kids, your mother-in-law or Father Jenkins!! This isn't as much a complaint as an observation--one you really should heed before you try watching the film. I just can't see most folks gravitating to a movie like this one, though if you do, it IS incredibly unique and well made.",6
15,23 July 2007,pyrocitor,10," Brutally funny, a stylish masterpiece","The tightly knit formula for the average ""heist movie"", is constantly in danger of becoming predictable to the point of redundancy with each new increasingly formulaic entry, so to see a film quietly whisk in and reinvigorate the genre was a refreshing feat indeed. And if anyone was up for the task, it was visionary director Guy Ritchie, sweeping into theaters fresh off his cult classic Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to deliver his most hard hitting, savagely funny and effortlessly stylish film to date - Snatch.

One of my all time favourite films.","Snatch starts in Antwerp where four guy's dressed as Jewish Rabai's gain entry & steal an 86 carat diamond from a building, one of the gang Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) smuggles it into London where he plans to sell it to crooked jewellery dealer Doug 'The Head' Denovitz (Mike Reid), however his Russian mates double cross him & informs shady Russian gangster Boris 'The Blade' Yurinov (Rade Serbedzija) who hires two petty criminals Vincent (Robbie Gee) & Sol (Lennie James).

18,22 April 2020,h-28658,8, Snatch is just a fun ride all around.,"Its filled with plenty of hilarious British dark humor.

21,4 May 2006,lee_eisenberg,10, Surely someone can understand Brad Pitt's accent...,"If you thought that Guy Ritchie's first movie was whacked-out, then get a load of this! ""Snatch."" has a rather convoluted plot, but the pace makes it worthwhile. Focusing on several groups of criminals trying to capture a diamond, it's basically a series of crazy situations. The weirdest (by which I mean ""coolest"") aspect is of course Brad Pitt's incomprehensible accent. But the other characters also have their own things to reveal about themselves.",f
22,25 March 2006,Boba_Fett1138,9, Awesome movie.,This is top-class entertainment. The movie is brilliantly constructed and has its own unique style. Both the story and characters are over-the-top and therefor also extremely fun.,_
23,15 June 2021,cagebox111,8, Guy Ritchie's Best,"Snatch is the best Guy Ritchie has to offer. While quite similar to Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch is better acted, better paced, overall more compelling, and has a more satisfying ending. There is really nothing wrong with Snatch, its just solid entertainment.",=
24,2 March 2023,moviepro69,10, Never gets boring,"I've seen this movie not only with the older of my kids but with the parents. It's a movie everyone can enjoy. Each time you re-watch it you seem to understand the wackiness a little more. It has a great usage of darkish humor and has an overall engaging atmosphere to it. Speaking from bias, Brad Pitt adds a sense of worth to this movie - he is always in really good films! This is the type of movie you can put on late at night when you are looking for some quick and easy laughter, but not only that. It's a good movie with a great looping plot (meaning the end of the movie feeds quite nicely into the opening of the movie).",t
25,5 April 2020,danielmanson,8, Why did I wait 20 years to watch this?,"Granted I was only 7 years old at the time but I'm sticking with my title. It's a great film, it's hilarious, action packed, great characters, fantastic editing and cinematography and just overall a good watch.

26,29 April 2014,SnoopyStyle,7, Guy Ritchie's style on full display,Turkish (Jason Statham) and his buddy Tommy are two low life boxing promoters.

27,22 March 2020,Majikat76,9, 20 years on and still a great watch!,"A film I revisit at least once a year, the intertwining stories, the hierarchy of criminals, the simplistic, dark, comical dialogue and recognisable faces, make this a true Brit classic!",u
28,5 August 2006,Flagrant-Baronessa,8, Weeding through the Cockney slang is half the experience,"In this fast-paced thriller-comedy Ritchie again takes us into the 'underworld' of England and this time he does it with more assured direction than in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. This is a world full of tough, gritty and eccentric characters who cheat each other on everything from rigged unlicensed boxing games to multi-million pound diamond heists. This heist is central to the wide montage of characters in Snatch who all want a piece of the action.",r
29,6 July 2017,Floated2,2, Lot of characters not much interest,"Snatch has been critically acclaimed throughout and has been praised as such a great film with an interesting take on a British crime, involving many characters. However as watching the film, there were many characters but too many where we did not care for them. The plot at times is confusing with these characters all coming together but in the end we do not really care. For a film with a running time of a little over 1 hour 40 minutes, it feels longer than one should. As an ensemble cast, not many stand out except Jason Statham (in a very early role in his career) and Brad Pitt (though not in a good way, speaking with a difficult hard to hearing accent- and wondering why he took this role).

31,28 March 2008,zardoz-13,10," British Crime Goes From Rags to Ritchie's ""Snatch""","Although they don't produce as many gangster movies as we Americans, the British know how to make some proper, first-rate, sure-fire crime thrillers. Movies such as ""The Lavender Hill Mob"" (1951), ""The League of Gentlemen"" (1960), ""Robbery"" (1967), ""The Italian Job"" (1969), ""Get Carter"" (1971), ""Sitting Target"" (1972), ""McVicar"" (1980), ""The Long Good Friday"" (1981), ""Buster"" (1988), and ""The Krays"" (1990) exemplify the upper tier of British crime cinema.",
32,4 March 2008,BJJManchester,6," Slick,quick,but ultimately empty gangster opus","Upper middle-class mockney Guy Ritchie virtually remakes his previous hit LOCK,STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS,but this time with a larger budget,the addition of a Hollywood big-name (Brad Pitt),and even more flamboyant surface style than before.But this does not disguise the excessively complicated plot,the rather glib characterisations (not enhanced by jokey,Runyonese monikers),and the undoubted emptiness that lies beneath Ritchie's directorial excesses which threatened to get out of hand on LOCK STOCK;it certainly goes several miles overboard in SNATCH,which is to the film's considerable detriment.It is quite obvious that Ritchie is impersonating such American filmmakers as Scorcese and Tarantino (who himself has always been somewhat derivative of other directors,and judging by his recent efforts seems to be running out of the ideas he once had),though the gangster epics made by the aforementioned had far more style,depth,wit and conviction about them.Ritchie's closeted,wealthy background means that his essay in low-life criminality comes across as a caricatured,stylised fantasy,which admittedly is slick and very fast-paced,but lacking in the slightest bit of profundity.He may think his various directorial flourishes which he frequently employs here (and to a somewhat lesser extent in LOCK STOCK) are clever and the epitome of innovation,but they are actually anything but;merely designed to cover the obviousness of the plot,they rapidly become wearisomely flashy,and so resistibly self regarding as to become monstrous and indeed wholly pointless and unnecessary;subtler and quieter directorial techniques would've been much more credible and effective.",

35,15 June 2007,kmillervir,10," Fun, Fast, and down right cool","Snatch is definitely much better than Ritchies first movie ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and is one of the most underrated films ever. I don't know why no one has ever seen this movie, its gotta be up there with some of the funnest, and most creative movies ever. Its fast the whole time, you never get bored, it has a good mix of action and dialogue. Its one of the coolest movies you'll ever see. Go out, rent it, and then buy it. Its better than any other below the belt action movies you can get. Its funny, smart, and there is really no other movie like it.

46,19 November 2005,gavin6942,9, A Win for Everyone,"Snatch is a gangster tale, set in England. While it's nothing like these films, the best comparisons I can make are ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Way of the Gun"". All the actors do a spectacular job, especially Brad Pitt who plays Mickey the Piker. His ability to play a marble-mouthed boxer is impressive, comparable to any of his other solid roles. The camera work is brilliant, with guns directing the direction of angles. Boris the Blade is one of the greatest mob characters ever invented. But best of all is the intricacy of the script. Rather than a straight ""rise to the top"" gangster movie like Scarface, this one requires multiple viewings to really understand. Multiple gangsters with various affiliations going after different objectives. Yet they're all interconnected, and trying to keep straight in your mind who works for whom might just take a little work. This film is highly recommended, and even more so if you're already a fan of the other films mentioned.",

55,8 March 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," An energetically eclectic, hyperactive yet occasionally unfocused comedy of errors.","'Snatch (2000)' is an energetically eclectic, hyperactive yet occasionally unfocused comedy of errors in which whatever could go wrong does go wrong. It's a series of eventually intertwining parallel stories each centred around a stolen stone which feature a cast of colourful, mostly inept characters with slightly weird names and a mainly cockney lilt (aside from the Russian, the American and the sort-of-but-not-really Irish thing that Brad Pitt tries to do). It deals in stereotypes and the comedy is pretty broad, but the film isn't so much funny as it is exhaustively coincidental in a strangely compelling way, with the usually dumb-as-bricks characters making a major mistake only to run into someone (sometimes literally) who then fixes that mistake or changes their path entirely. It's not so much a straightforward narrative as one that keeps you guessing as to where it's going to go while simultaneously not mattering at all, as it's the individual situations themselves that entertain. The fact it all ties together in the end is, strangely, kind of a bonus. 7/10",

57,30 June 2009,ianlouisiana,3," 6 cans of Stella,a prawn vindaloo and thee.......","In the gutter and looking down,that's ""Snatch"".Obviously its extremely violent,foul-mouthed and aimed at blokes under 30 who think Mr Vinnie Jones is the mutt's nuts.Cheap laughs,racism - ""I hate fxxxxx pikeys"" is a constant refrain - abound and the movie continues to demonstrate the director's peculiar sycophancy to the South London demi - monde. One day those Frankie Fraser wannabees are going to get fed up with being portrayed as beetle-browed psychopaths without the wit to stay out of the nick long enough to sit through 15 three minute rounds. Here Mr Ritchie has trawled through the pages of ""Rent an 'ard bastard"" and come up with a ""comic"" cast whose idea of doing comedy is to read their lines like Morecambe and Wise,almost nodding and winking at the audience to let them in on the gag. The worst offender is the aforementioned Mr Jones who,regretfully, displays all the signs of a man who has come to believe his own publicity. The bareknuckle boxing plot has Irish Traveller Mr Brad Pitt outsmarting the crafty cockneys at their own game - not perhaps the most challenging of tasks - and the saga of the big.big,big,big diamond is more than a little reminiscent of Stanley Kramer's early sixties masterpiece but instead of under the Big Dubbleya,the treasure ends up inside a traveller's dog. Best viewed as a twenty - something bloke with a bunch of other twenty - something blokes,belching,breaking wind and necking the Stella as if there was no tomorrow. If that is not your thing I can honestly advise you to give it a wide berth.",

Still, the interaction among its characters, from the guy who keeps losing his fingers, the three black men with the dog, to Brad Pitt and his mother, fried in her trailer. The plot is convoluted and intriguing. There are two issues: a huge diamond and boxing match that needs fixing. Sometimes when so many cooks are involved, the broth gets pretty strange. These guys are all at the top of their games, each looking over their shoulder to see when the next shoe will fall. It would be fun to see it again, knowing the relationships that developed throughout. There are delightful performances all around and we actually find some of the characters naive and rather playful.

Now, don't get me wrong, I love England, however that one line has stuck in my head that when I arrived in Hong Kong after spending two nights in Bangkok, if anybody at Hong Kong customs were to ask me if I had anything to declare (mind you, you don't actually go through customs in Hong Kong, only if you have something to declare) I was going to say 'yeah, don't go to Thailand' (though I must heed the warning of a friend of mine from my last job not to crack jokes at customs).",

The script is full of rapid-fire patter and colourful Brit-slang, and the characters are unforgettable, especially (to name but a few) enforcer 'Bullet-tooth Tony' (Vinnie Jones), murderous pig-keeper Bricktop (Alan Ford), 'sneaky Russian' Boris-the-Blade (Rade Serbedzija), and Mickey, the nearly incomprehensible Gypsy bare-knuckle boxing champion (a priceless Brad Pitt).

74,15 August 2008,Jasper76,9, Not bad at all,"""Snatch"" is a lot like ""Lock Stock"" in many ways. The formulas are exactly the same, and we have quirky characters, and scene-stealing Vinnie Jones always ready to slam a guys head in a car door. And of course a lot of underdogs getting to the top by some freak accident. It's differences are the presence of American actors (Benicio Del Toro, Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina) and in some ways it is more American. It's a lot more violent than ""Lock Stock"" and has more of a darkness to it. I'm teeter tottering whether I like the more violence and darkness in this Guy Ritchie project. I don't know whether I'm a big fan of the violence in this one, or maybe I just don't like hand to hand combat. The darkness is attributed with characters who have more depth than the characters in ""Lock Stock"". Though Brad Pitt's character is very funny, there is a moment, when his caravan is burning down, of a sad intensity in his eyes, there was nothing like this in ""Lock Stock"". I think Guy Ritchie's character development shows that he has grown more from his first project. Though he is following the same formulas as his previous work, there is more elements added to ""Snatch"". I highly suggest if you haven't seen ""Snatch"" or ""Lock Stock"", I suggest seeing ""Lock stock"" first. Because they are highly comparable (as if you couldn't tell) and ""Lock stock"" will help you bone up on the way Guy Ritchie writes and directs. I also suggest if you're new to Guy Ritchie to get a pad and paper and play connect the dots between all the characters. It's kind of hard doing it in your head like I did when I watched ""Snatch.""",

Snatch is marvelous,"Guy Ritchie's debut ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was a refreshing, lean, original, and very funny British mixture of Action Comedies/Gambling Dramas/Crime Thrillers. ""Lock, Stock.."" also introduced Jason Statham with whom Ritchie went on to making two more films and Vinnie Jones, a football player turned an actor. Ritchie's next movie, Snatch, was my introduction to his work. It is simply marvelous and my favorite. It uses the same broken narrative as Lock and Stock, intertwines numerous plot threads which intersect and play off each other, and follows the characters who are over-the-top deliciously evil, marvelously clueless and always funny. The plot revolves around a stolen diamond as huge as these historic celebrated stones you might have seen on display in the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom in London Tower or Washington Museum of Natural History or in The State Diamond Fund of Moscow Kremlin. No wonder that every character in Snatch tries to get it. Among them, low-levels gangsters of all sorts of mafia, including Jewish, Russian, and London based. Add to the mix the Irish Gypsies ""who can't be trusted"" because whatever they say could not be understood even by the native English speakers. Don't forget a sadistic crime boss who keeps huge pet pigs with very specific diet. And then there is a dog that likes to snatch and swallow things. All sorts of things.",

As a result, the British have a bit of a rigid temperament and their sense of humor is always a little bit bashful, seems to be unable to break away from that bit of the so-called traditional reserved.
Guy Ritchie is a master of dark humor, and he's a bit of an outlier among British directors.

I had heard plenty of good things about this film, and I do believe that I've seen some of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels(though that didn't impress me much, actually), and after seeing some advertisements for this, I was looking forward to seeing it. I must say, it did meet my expectations, though it didn't exceed them. The plot is great, very interesting and constantly developing. It also has a good pace, you're never bored, which can also be attributed to the many quick cuts and great editing. The acting is great, I really enjoyed Brad Pitt and Vinnie Jones, not to mention Jason Statham, though they were all great, I think. The characters were diverse, well-written and credible, not to mention quite entertaining, though at times they became a little lame, in obvious attempts at humor. The action is great, though there is fairly little of it; it's mostly sacrificed for the sake of more humor. Don't get me wrong, the humor is mostly good too, but sometimes it just seems like there is too little action in it, though, when there is action, it's good. The camera work and overall filming style is, well, stylish, and looks very cool. I liked the use of slow-motion, fast-motion and instantly changing angles, not to mention the well-placed quick cuts. The way the diamond constantly changed hands in the film was great, though a fairly basic way to keep the plot going. I liked all of the things that didn't have anything to do with the diamond, like the gypsies and the boxing, but I did think the plot revolved a little too much around the diamond. All in all, a very entertaining film, that couldn't have been much better or much more professionally made, but was lacking a little. I recommend it to fans of British/violent humor, and fans of the actors. I guess people who liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels will enjoy this too, though I can't say for sure, as I haven't seen it. 8/10",

126,7 July 2008,kenjha,8, Jolly Good,"A hodgepodge of plot lines comprise this comedy about the low-lifes of London, featuring characters such as ""Franky Four Fingers"" and ""Boris the Blade."" Ritchie's followup to ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is far superior because he has much better script to work with. As with the earlier film, Ritchie goes a little overboard with his hyperactive camera-work, but is not as distracting because of the amusing situations and funny dialog. The running joke is that nobody can understand boxer Pitt's Irish Gypsy accent; ironically, to those outside Britain, it is hard to understand what most of the characters are saying. Thank heavens for subtitles.",

It was hard to sit in the theater and watch everyone around me enjoy this film.  I kept thinking to myself what am I missing.

But Snatch was a pretty big surprise that kind of came out of nowhere. Besides the first rate performances, this film had some incredibly innovative photography (second only to The Matrix?), as well as some brilliant editing techniques. Some of the editing was so fast and so surprising that it's actually funny (the plane-flight sequences, for example).",

If I want to hear the f-word 153 times, I'll just call a Detroit tech support. So once again, a bunch of criminals get themselves into the most standard situations available, like being in debt with Harry the Hatchet uhm, Brick Top, stealing diamonds (where would he get that from?), betting on illegal boxing matches etc. It's pretty obvious the only crime Guy Ritchie has ever witnessed is when Madonna gets her pay. Obviously, everybody needs nicknames again, Boris the Blade (he has nothing to do with blades but hey, it's an alliteration), Frankie Four Fingers, Doug The Head, you get how it works by now. Obviously the movie is still quite good because it's so like Tarantino that you can't help enjoying yourself and I suppose it's Guy Ritchie's specialty (I'm not saying it's great, I'm saying I've seen ""Swept Away"").

The humour is better and I have never seen people in a cinema laugh as loud and as frequently as they did here. Vinnie Jones plays a similar role as Big Chris, here as Bullet Tooth Tony. His appearance is limited but boy does he make an impact. Even when he is not on screen there is much to savour from Dennis Farina as Avi and a trio of pawnbrokers who are sent to rob a bookies. Brad Pitt sheds his movie start personna and preforms impressively as an Irish gypsie. Unlike Lock Stock.. the humour will appeal to all nationalities. However they mind some slang expressions such as Pikey and blag hard to understand. Good preformances, fantastic characters, razor sharp diologue, expert direction and camera work and brilliant humour, Snatch will make you laugh more than any other movie this year. See it now.",

Alan Ford to be sure is quite good in the role of a psychotic gangster, and Statham and Graham are lovable. But everyone else is forgetable. Except for Pitt who is neither forgettable nor very good. The only thing worst then his performance is his Irish accent, which I can assure anyone who has not seen the film, is terrible.

There're no soft spots.  It's hilarious. Now, reading through the 230+ reviews, I can see that black comedy, violence and mayhem is not everybody's cup of tea.

150,17 June 2016,srepolt,10, Guy Ritchie is one of the most underrated directors of our time!,"To simply put it, this is my Generations Pulp Fiction. With that being said I know there are people on IMDb who would disagree but that's just because this movie is not meant to be taken too seriously. Just like Tarantino, this movie is heavily character driven which is anchored on very clever set ups. The only deference is that the story for the most part is told in a linear fashion and it also happens to be much more lighthearted considering all of the violence. If you are a fan of knuckle headed crime dramas that are filled with over the top exaggerated characters, than this movie is for you. It has action, well fleshed out characters, hilarious dialogue, and a very intriguing premise that once you start watching, you can't help but want to know the films final outcome. Overall Snatch is very well acted and entertaining movie for fans of Tarantino style crime films.",

It had that hard edged comedy that Pulp Fiction seemingly invented. As a matter of fact, except for Fight Club, this may be the best movie that has come out since Pulp Fiction. This should definitely be up for an oscar, and Brad Pitt for best supporting actor. You can't understand a word he says but he still manages to say more than most actors do in a 5 minute monologue. Another highlight was Benicio Del Toro who, while not in the film for very long, steals every scene he's in.

They are only no names in my book, but they may be established in English cinema. I loved some of the characters and every one of them was unique in their own way, but added a lot to it. I loved Brick Top. This maybe be sad, but after Seven and Fight Club this is the only movie that I don't hate Brad Pitt as an actor. He held his own in this movie.
