0,8 September 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, A cinematic bad boy,"Oldboy really is an odd movie. It's totally unconventional, completely original, and unlike anything else you'll probably find out there, even in the realms of Asian cinema. To say too much would be to spoil the ride, but this is a film where you'll always be guessing what's going to happen next and never quite sure what's really going on.",/
1,22 January 2022,Xstal,10, You Only Live Once...,"Imagine what you'd do, when you wake from a bad dream, to find you're held by four square walls, for as long as someone deems. No idea why you're trapped, what you've done, why you're kidnapped, just a ceaseless line of dumplings going down your gyoza hatch. Now some fifteen years have passed, every question has been asked, and you're suddenly set free, can start your own avenging spree. Before you do you need to feed, by eating something that's in need, so an octopus is ordered, and head first you cross the borders. But things aren't what they might seem, tied and tethered and undreamed, as the puppet master hovers, manipulates what you'll discover.",r
2,22 July 2007,johnny-08,10, Excellent in it's sickness,"I looked at program for today and I saw movie ""Oldboy"". I read plot and I liked it. What I expected is decent thriller from very good South Korean cinematography,something like ""Salinui chueok "". But once again I was wrong. ""Oldboy"" is masterpiece, so unusual from all other movies. I've seen lots of violence on screen and to me this isn't nothing new but I think that people under 18 really shouldn't watch this one. It's because movie is brutal and I don't think that younger ones would fully understand this one.",e
3,19 December 2007,bur_007,10, If only we were all living in Asia....,"To start off; This is the one and only film that kept me quiet for a whole 5 mins after seeing it. I literally couldn't close my mouth, and yet there wasn't any sound coming out of it. Oldboy had such an impact on me that words are too little to describe that impact. Therefore this film is definitely in my top 3 films ever made. It belongs there because it has a massive ingredient that a lot of films seem to miss out on; a divine plot. Even though the acting and screenplay are world class, the plot is really the cherry on the cake.",v
4,29 July 2007,Genevieve_X,9, Freaked me out,"I haven't written a comment on IMDb for about 3 years but was inspired to with this film. It is not very often that I come across a film by accident (World Movies on cable) and the spend the next day scouring the internet to find out information about it and can't get it out of my head! Anyway, yep there are plot holes, but Old boy borrows a lot from surrealism and you are meant to suspend your disbelief! I don't buy comments when people say ""it is so unrealistic because he should've done this ..."" because it is a surrealist film and meant to be unrealistic! For me the sign of a good film is if it sticks on your head! THis one surely does (althought I did have to look away a few times ... ) Loved it!!!! Work of cruel genius!!! (HOLLYWOOD - Please don't ruin it by remaking it!!!)",i
5,3 February 2009,LeroyBrown-2,8, As good and disturbing as expected.,"I read the review for ""Oldboy"" a few years ago and have since read praise about the movie from IMDb posters. Often times movies with that kind of hype tend to fall short and is a major disappointment. I don't know anything about Korean cinema so I had fairly low expectations. I had expected it to be a simplistic revenge film, shot in bad film stock. Well I have to say that I'm glad I was wrong, and even gladder still that I actually watched this film.",e
6,17 March 2007,lucas739,9, Great film!,"I feel compelled to defend this film from some quite frankly unwarranted criticism. Although it isn't without its flaws, and all films have a few,it certainly isn't a one star film.What this film has is the ability to be sublime, shocking, ridiculous, mildly amusing and visually stunning which is some feat for any film.The sheer scale of the comments here suggests that here is a film that gets to you in one way or another. This film is as far away from Maborosi as you can get yet both films are up there as great pieces of cinema. I wont divulge the plot or end this comment with a Latin quote to reinforce my self importance i'll just say go and watch it, preferably if you're not too squeamish and don't mind subtitles.This film left me thinking about it the following day which is normally a good thing (atleast it shows my memory is working!)",w
7,12 February 2008,kywoo7,9, A couple of answers that may be useful to understand this film better!!,"Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.",/
8,4 March 2007,LoneWolfAndCub,10, One of the most gripping movies I have ever seen,"Oldboy is one of the most intense movies you will ever see. Breathtaking, brutal and easily one of the best revenge movies ever made. The acting is amazing, especially Choi as the main protagonist Dae-su Oh. All the actors did great but his performance was powerful and emotional (all you need to do is see the infamous squid scene). Chan-wook Park gives this movie a very unique style with his direction. The plot starts off like a fairly standard revenge drama but he slowly makes the movie darker through a series of beautifully shot flashbacks and a huge scene involving nothing but a family photo album.",r
9,16 June 2018,paulclaassen,5, I don't get it; what's the hype all about?,"'Oldboy' is constantly mentioned as one of the greatest Korean films ever made, and has also been called the most disturbing Korean film (followed by 'I saw the Devil' and 'The Chaser', which were both incredibly disturbing). I therefore eagerly watched the film in high anticipation, but am quite sad to say I was very disappointed. It started off very interesting and mysterious, and the story was told in a very unique way. The moment Oh Dae Su is released, the film becomes very neo-noir-ish (and I don't enjoy neo-noir) and I actually found it to me more comedic than disturbing or suspenseful. Choi Min-sik was excellent, as usual, and without him in the lead I might have liked the film even less. So, essentially the film is about an old school friend, Lee Woo-jin, who wants to avenge Oh Dae-Su for Lee's sister's suicide. Because of this he locks him up for 15 years, then sets him free after 'programming' both him and his daughter via hypnosis to fall in love. Uhmm, ok... Ok, spoilers to follow, so stop reading if you don't want to know. Is this filmed said to be the most disturbing film simply because it is revealed the woman he so eagerly had sex with is actually his daughter? Nothing else in the film is disturbing. When all is said and done and Lee kills himself (what an anti-climax!!), Oh Dae-Su tracks down the hypnotist and asks her to erase his memory of his daughter so they can have a relationship. Seriously!!?? So he'd rather have her as his lover than his daughter?? I rest my case...",w
10,3 October 2009,KineticSeoul,9, One of the best Korean movie I have ever seen,"I will start out by saying that Chan-wook Park is a film making genius, maybe Quentin Tarantino of Korea. The plot was original and the character development and cinematography was really well done. This is a revenge story that grips you from beginning to end, especially at the end. This movie is a must see, even if you have a weak stomach go watch it anyways, cause there will be those ""thats f***** up"" moments, the fight scenes are few but realistic. I am not going to ruin anything about this movie or give away the pot, all I can say is just watch the damn movie. Korean film making at it's best.",2
11,20 October 2007,MrVibrating,10," Complex, challenging masterpiece that puts Hollywood to shame.","While Hollywood is slowly choking to death on clichés and unrealistic budgets, the movie lovers turn their attention to Asia. Especially interesting is Korea's emerging movie industry. Japan has a long tradition of quality horror and anime and China dominates the epics with state-sponsored spectacles. Which place Korea will take we don't know but if Oldboy is any inclination it would be intelligent, disturbing drama-action movies.",9
12,11 April 2005,Chris Knipp,7, Revenge: a dish best eaten live?,"In Park Chan-wook's 'Oldboy' (which won the grand prize at Cannes in 2004 when Tarantino was at the helm), a rough-looking man is held by the cops for some hours after a drunk. A series of relentless jump-cuts show him misbehaving at the police station. Once bailed out, he suddenly disappears in a pour-down rain while his rescuer is in a phone booth. The next we know he's imprisoned in a tiny apartment-like jail cell, and is held there for.fifteen years! Again jump cuts take us through this experience, which includes pumped-in gas while he sleeps, self-tattoos of cross-hatching to remind himself of the years, a journal, a constant TV which is his only companion, imaginary swarms of insects, and personal martial-arts conditioning that includes punching the wall till his knuckles bleed.",9
13,20 February 2008,coldwaterpdh,10, Absolutely authentic and 100% bad ass.,"The first time I saw ""Oldboy"" I watched it by myself on a rainy evening. When the credits rolled at the end I think I actually stood up and clapped. It's been a long time since I've seen something so original. The film is gripping, it grabs and never lets you go.",7
14,17 February 2012,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,10," Park Chan-Wook's Masterful ""Oldboy"" is a Tour-De-Force of storytelling! My favorite film of all time!","I just recently noticed that I have written 99 reviews on IMDb since joining in 2005. And I have decided, in honor of my 100th review, to tackle my favorite film- a Korean release from 2003, directed by the masterful Park Chan-Wook. I am speaking of course, of the controversial and amazingly elegant film ""Oldboy.""",0
15,7 March 2007,ryuakamrvengeance,9, One step ahead of America,"Oldboy takes a hammer and ""batters"" its American equivalents, leaving them as pulped as a chewed up squid. Park Chan Wook displays what America misses with his ultra-stylish, ultra-violent thriller. Why watch Ben Affleck fail spectacularly to summon any displayable talent, when Min sik Choi serves up a memorable role as the disturbed, vengeful Dae Su Oh, in the second of the Vengeance trilogy. Park skillfully creates a compelling plot that will have you guessing through the entire film, up until the final shocking revelation. The Cinematography expertly done by Jeong-hun Jeong, who also worked on the follow up to this film, Chinjeolhan geumjassi. Everything about this film is done in style and panache and creates a memorable experience, and has many memorable scenes.",7
16,21 April 2007,max8791,9, One of most well-made films I've ever seen,"I decided to check this movie out after Ebert's 4 star rave review, and the cult status this movie has received (and was also intrigued by the sexy-looking Ultimate Edition), so I decided to rent it. I was VERY surprised at how different it was than I expected it to be - I expected a ton of violence and not much in the way of writing or acting. The first time I saw it, I wasn't blown away, just kind of like whatever.",6

I have just read a review that says the reviewer cannot understand the hype. I can see no hype. Everything the film promised and more was delivered. This is a truly wonderful film. It is beautifully acted, brutally and painstakingly directed and as good a display of raw emotion as I have witnessed in any language. The story is gripping, the characters believable and well rounded, the emotion human and the feeling I was left with at the end of the film is one of awe. And that was after I had watched it twice. Honestly, this is a truly, truly wonderful film. Do not miss it under any circumstances!",f
22,5 September 2022,atkinsonlouise-73873,10, A true masterpiece!,"Man this film is good. Having watched the remake from 2013 first, I finally watched the original and man it's streets ahead of the Spike Lee version. I already knew the plot, but it's told so much better here with a more realistic feel that still keeps the sickening nature of the plot I know. Also the ending is so much better. What sells it, is the chemistry between Choi Min-sik and Kang Hye-jung who feel like they genuinely feel the way they do for one another. Also, Yoo Ji-tae is a phenomenal villain who is cold, calculated and calm. The other standouts are the shots, man they're creative and iconic, showing the directors vision to a tee. Also the soundtrack is weird and cool, mixing European music with Wild West stuff. A fabulous and creepy movie that truly stands out and I can't fault.",_

26,16 July 2015,ironhorse_iv,8, Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Old Boys was very interesting!,"This South Korean mystery thriller neo-noir film is like a hammer. It always manage to hit the nail on the head. Directed by Park Chan-wook, and loosely based on the Japanese manga of the same name written by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiya. Oldboy is the second installment of The Vengeance Trilogy, preceded by 2002's Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and followed by 2005's Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. The film follows the story of a Korean businessman, Oh Dae-su (Min-sik Choi), who is locked in a hotel room for 15 years without knowing the identity of his captor or his captor's motives. When he is finally released, Dae-su finds himself still trapped in a web of lies, conspiracy and violence. With the help of a female Japanese chef named Mi-do (Hye-jeong Kang) and one of his old computer friends, No Joo-hwan (Dae-han Ji), Dae-su must find a way to piece together the scattered clues of who took his life away from him, while cutting down anyone who gets in his path. Without spoiling the movie too much, this film has a lot of twist and turns, that will keep the viewer, interested in the story. The movie is an extreme art-house film, often using tropes taken from previous psychological movies such as 1929's Un Chien Andalou (1929) & 1966's Persona. The film also has several parallels to classic stories such as William Shakespeare's to Titus Andronicus & French author Alexandre Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo. The most famous one is the Greek myth of Oedipus Rex. Other works, like Ella Wheeler Wilcox's famous poem, ""Solitude"", played a big part in this film. ""The Man of Sorrow"" by Belgium painter James Ensor gave the movie, some depth with it looks. Classical music gave the movie, its ears. ""The Last Waltz"" by Frédéric François Chopin, and the first movement of Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons: Winter"" are certainly used the best. The rest of the entire soundtrack is a work of genius. Not only does every title clearly applies to the events seen in the film when the track is played, but every track is takes their name after a famous film noir film. The acting is excellent for the most part. Min-sik Choi really put a lot of work, into this film. Not only did, he nailed it, with the emotional side, he trained for six weeks and lost twenty pounds to get in shape for the role of Dae-su, and did most of his own stunt work. If that wasn't extreme, enough, he ate four real life live octopodes as Dae-su in the sushi bar scene. While, it did provoked some controversy abroad. Eating live octopus in Korea is commonplace although it is usually sliced first. I saw nothing wrong with it, as long as he ate all of them. That scene was used, to represent, Dae-su hatred toward his enemies and I think Min-sik Choi capture that. Supporting character, Ji-tae Yu as Woo-jin Lee was great at being sinister, while being realistic. Director Quentin Tarantino was at the screening and was shocked to find himself crying for a character who had been completely despicable for the prior duration of the movie. That's how much, Ji-tae Yu got people to invest in the character. The only weak acting in the film, had to be Hye-jeong Kang as Mi-do. I really didn't like her damsel in distress, manic pixie dream girl role. Still, this was a very powerful film. The movie was shot, superb. Great use of mirrors, as a symbolism of fragmentation of one self. I like how everybody is looking at another person, through a mirror. I like how shots of Woo-jin Lee, show how much omnipotent by wealth, he is. I like how Dae-su is shown as the common man. Getting back at the society, by hammer. It remind me of socialism ideas pitting against that of capitalism. Still, the most well-known shot had to be, the lengthy scene in which Oh Dae-su takes on over a dozen men armed with just a hammer. Given that the scene is nearly 5 minutes long, and is all filmed on one camera, in one take. The fight sequence took three days, worth of attempts to nail it. The violence in this film wasn't as violent, as some critics made it out to be. The torture wasn't too in- depth, as the camera cuts away, when things become way too gory. I found the violent to, pretty tame for a Rated R film. The story matter is indeed shocking. The whole twist toward the end is a gut-wrenching and sick. The movie ends with a gloomy ambiguous ending. While, some people might see this as a fault; I see it as thought provoking. While Dae-su is let out of captivity, he can only free himself, by finding out why he was imprisoned. Dae-su takes on many aspects of an Ubermensch on finding the truth, but ultimately his character has no control of his own fate and plays into his enemies' hands. By the end of the movie he is a very, very broken man. It's a great example of why human decisions are meaningless and choice is an illusion. One of the most important themes of Old Boy is the truth. Sometimes, the truth doesn't set you free. The only thing, that I can see as a fault of the film is how some scenes were very confusing. One of the biggest mistake, you can make, is watching it, with the English dubbing. It's horrible. It doesn't match with the lips on the screen at all. Unfortunately, you will lose a lot of Korean language drastically changed over those fifteen years, with it. You should watch it with English subtitle, instead. This movie help influence a Bollywood remakes in 2005 & an American remake in 2013. Overall: This dark Oedipian tragedy is somewhat enlightening. Drop the hammer, and give this a watch! You will not be disappointed.",_
27,6 September 2007,tetsuoisleet,10," Pass by the ""Boo"" comments.","After going through the comments, i must say i'm impressed how many people out there don't have a slightest clue of beauty or intelligent screenplays. there are so many comments from people that totally disliked the movie. which is plain and simple not possible, if you got an open mind and a open heart (and are not drunk). I would compare it to chocolate. You may find it too sweet and prefer bitter chocolate. or you like white chocolate more. Or you got diabetes and can only sometimes eat one. But people that totally dislike chocolate scare me to death. Same goes for Oldboy, you gotta admit some of the genius art-form it contains. Its everything in there. Its heartwarming , disgusting, intelligent, beautiful and lead with outstanding performance of any actor . You HAVE to like something, cause it wont get much better. Its chocolate. If you disliked the movie so much and on a constant basis, why even bother to write a comment? My guess is you just could not follow the movie at all. which is my only guess actually. well enough rambling.",u

I knew 2 things: 1. From a visual point of view, it's one of the best movies I have ever seen. Cinematography & scenography are nothing short of perfection. 2.

30,6 August 2010,xnrat,1, Why?,Why? That is the main question about this movie. When I watched this movie it didn't yet have its devoted followers.

This is the movie that got me hooked on Asian revenge films. Oldboy is an original movie that shows what happens when a man's freedom is taken away and he doesn't know why, or by whom. He is sudden thrust back into society where he must track down the person that took away his freedom. Along the way come multiple plot twist and surprises that you just don't see coming. ",

35,27 July 2009,grdontom,10," Emotional, evocative and excellent.","Old Boy is my favourite film. As far as I can see, no amount of superlatives could explain quite how much I love it. After my first viewing, (all on my lonesome) I realised I probably hadn't blinked during its entirety and I could quite possibly have been burgled during its course and been none the wiser, such was the extent to which I found it totally and utterly engrossing. Obviously a review consisting of very little other than me spewing praise would be a fairly dull read which was why I never bothered to review Old Boy until after my second viewing, with my Po'. My father being the eternal sceptic that he is turned out to be an extremely worthy person to watch the film with, and his response to it opened my eyes a little as to why I love it that much.",

37,8 September 2005,somf,6, I don't get it.,"Nothing about this film rang true. I've enjoyed a lot of Asian cinema, but perhaps I have just no understanding of the Korean culture. Little that the characters did during the entire film made much sense. There were some wonderful individual scenes and great camera-work, but that didn't make up for a lot of things in the film that appeared for lack of a better word ""lame"". An example is when Oldboy holds off a gang of thugs with a hammer. It didn't work as ""comic book"" action nor as a realistic fight. Another example is the ant thing. Especially the giant ant on the subway. ""Hey, this would look arty"" Really disagree with those that loved this film. It has its merits. I wasn't fooled by the ending twist. Some disgusting scenes that made little sense. Just overall forgettable. I must admit though, I'm really curious how the American remake will turn out.",
38,30 July 2010,Theo Robertson,3, Doesn't Deserve To Be In The IMDb Top 250 List,"Some people people have described the South Korean film OLDBOY as challenging . For me the word "" challenging "" is perhaps most associated as challenging someone to a duel . You see a man walk down the street arm in arm with a woman who is far too good for him so challenge him to a duel . You cross swords literally and kill your opponent where hopefully the woman won't want his death to be in vain so she gives you her heart and soul for all eternity . There can be nothing more romantic than disemboweling or decapitating a man over a hot chick and if you think my way of thinking is grotesque or perverse please watch this film before casting any judgment over my character ",
39,16 May 2006,yduric,5, If only more people voted...,"There is one principle in politics which roughly says that the bigger a lie is,the easier it can be swallowed by a great number of people: I think that this can also be extended to films, that is to say that sometimes a film is so bad that it appears like a masterpiece to a great number of viewers: Oldboy, (and, in my opinion, 'The Shining' as well)illustrates this to a degree I have never seen before: what do we have in this film? 1)the movie is filmed like an below-average MTV-clip all along, something that, I do not doubt it, might be viewed as 'great cinema art' by some people, but, in my opinion, only denotes bad direction. 2) this film is full of totally and extremely distasteful violence and gore,added for 'shock-value, something that, I suppose, can certainly seem 'extremely impressive and audacious'to some people, but only left me and very probably other viewers as well with an impression of extreme boredom and reinforced my feeling that this denoted the total vacuity and senselessness of this film. 3)The plot, which I will not reveal here (I will leave it to the 'appreciation' of future viewers), is of a poverty many B-grade TV-movies would be jealous of. 4) And, of course, last but not least, the film got a prize at the Cannes film festival. So, what we do finally get here is a perfect 'screen of smoke'generated in order to prevent the viewer to see what lies beneath. There is, however, one thing that I noticed which greatly reassured me: the fact that the comments of the users who disliked the movie were found useful by a far greater number of people than the comments of the people who liked it: taking this into account, we get a far more accurate perception of the general feeling of the audience, a fact which is, unfortunately not reflected in the overall user rating, a user rating which would have been significantly different and maybe have sent 'Oldboy' out of the IMDb top 250, a better deserved place.",

43,28 October 2005,cultfilmfan,5, Oldboy,"Oldboy, is a Korean film although it is dubbed into English. The film is about a man named Oh Dae-Su, who is kidnapped and locked in a private prison for fifteen years. When he is finally set free he is given five days to find out who did this to him and he plans on finding out and getting revenge for his imprisonment and death of his wife. Oldboy, has good performances from everybody in the cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing and good art direction. The film starts off with a very interesting premise and the visual look of the film is great but the story seems to go downhill as the movie moves along. One of the big problems I had with this movie is that I had a really hard time understanding it and I found it very confusing and muddled. When the movie finally got near it's ending time I found the film too long and it got boring and I felt like it could have ended a lot sooner. Also in some ways the movie was kind of pointless to me and it really left no impact. I thought I would like this film quite a bit because of very good reviews it has received and some recommendations I have gotten for the film but other than it's visual style the movie did nothing for me.

45,26 April 2007,Dr_Coulardeau,10, A Universal Masterpiece,"This film, in spite of its sulfuric reputation, and the direct connection established by the media in the recent Virginia Tech massacre case, is a masterpiece. A boy has been privately imprisoned for fifteen years with no explanation at all, and of course no trial. It was a private initiative taken by some kind of criminal organization controlled by some kind of mafia itself organized by the entrepreneurial rich. When he is freed he tries to find out why he had been imprisoned like that and to get even with those responsible for it, hence to get his vengeance. The film is a lot more powerful than that in fact, than a simple vengeance case. He will understand that he had known something he shouldn't have known, and he had used it against a schoolmate of his though he should have known he should have kept it for himself, he should have kept his trap shut. And his talking, even if very little, was enough to cause the suicide of a person, and it is the schoolmate of his and lover of the suicidee that went through with his own justice. The film becomes great when the victim of this imprisonment understand his mistake, his crime, his responsibility in the death of the other person and mutilates his speaking for him never to speak anymore. But then the schoolmate, quite older of course understand that he caused a lot of suffering, the death of his victim's wife for instance and the disappearance of his daughter. He then brings justice back onto himself. And the Old Boy, meaning the boy who got old in this private prison, can finally tell the story, in writ, to a woman friend of his and he finally rediscovers love, even if mute love. And this time the film becomes a rewriting of Oedipus' myth: the criminal, unaware of his crime, blinds himself when he discovers the amplitude of his criminal attitude and will die slowly in poverty, rejection and begging. Here the responsibility is definitely shared, silence is imposed onto the criminal tongue, but death comes to the avenging initial criminal who did the first unlawful act that was revealed by the Old Boy, and this Old Boy can then rediscover love again via his writing down his own story. Guilt is always a shared human dimension and punishment must also be shared though some innocent people will pay for the crimes of others and the initial criminal will have to pay more than the subsequent ones. The human species is a very barbaric animal race and yet it is haunted by justice.",

Quentin and his Cannes Jury gave this film a prize, which is the sole reason I didn't walk out of the screening, vainly hoping to see some justification of this accolade. It didn't happen. I endured this film right up until it's bitterly lame and frankly laughable Scooby Doo ending.

What difference does it make if a crazy guy is so wealthy he can torture another guy for 15 years all due to a twisted incestuous affair? Not only is that whole plot line just dumb the only reason for it is so there can be some outrageous violence involving hammers and shears. I guess for many it's better than roll out the old serial killer and have him do horrible things to his victims but when it comes right down to it the only difference is this plot is just weirder. With the popularity of Saw I foresee many more wildly ridiculous plot lines just so we can have more violent set pieces. Anyway the film lost me when the guy bites into a live octopus and stuffs it in his mouth. I'm not interested in seeing this but I guess with ""reality"" TV this is the kind of thing I have to expect. And why is this movie in DTS?

Let's not even talk about artistic merit. Quentin Tarantino (maker of one, perhaps two great movies and a couple of good entertainments) is the most obvious salesman for the view that pulp junk, polished up and translated by cinematic trickery and fascinated with its own pop cultural hipness, is valuable (and Tarantino was on the committee at Cannes that gave this film the Grand Jury Prize). Park steals here from some of the greats (film noir specialists like Hitchcock, absurdists like Bunuel, masters of cinema cool like Kubrick), but lacks any feeling for what made *their* movies worth seeing. Put simply, it lacks wit (unless by wit you only mean slapstick), and its ideas are like bad homilies no one understands. I keep encountering this in the newer Japanese and Korean and Hong Kong cinema that seems influenced by Tarantino: comic book themes and characters pass through high-polish celluloid/digital trickery and a ironic pop filter (all borrowed). I hear Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, which I have but still haven't been able to force myself to sit through, is much the same. Avoid.",

67,25 April 2005,supcuzz,5, Best film at Cannes? Please explain.,"I just saw this at the Philly film festival and I was amazed at how so many people were conned into thinking this was such a great movie. While sitting on the steps before the movie started (all seats were sold out at that point) I heard such a buzz: ""...best Korean film of all time... won best picture at Cannes... ending will blow you away..."". In fact the guy who introduced OLDBOY said to the anxious crowd before the lights went dark that ""OLDBOY may be the greatest movie ever made"". I must admit I almost fell for it too. It looks beautiful and the director is nothing if not innovative and technically brilliant. However the praise goes only as deep as the razor thin plot line. To say this movie is contrived is a drastic understatement. I don't want to give anything away (why? I'm not quite sure) but lets just say this: the ridiculous ending to Park's OLDBOY is on par with the likes of Shamalan's SIGNS and whoever the moron was who directed last year's abysmal SAW. Now if you were amazed by the ludicrous 11th hour revelations in those movies (although SIGNS at least was pretty good up to that point) then you probably won't feel utterly cheated and let down by OLDBOY. I found myself saying ""good God they can't be serious!"". I can't really trash the movie for too many other reasons other than the weak story and atrocious ending. Everything else was pretty good, not #92 of all time and Cannes darling good, but decent and enjoyable. I actually cared about the characters which almost never happens in movies today, and the blood and violence which others have complained about I thought was a strong point. But the story! Come on already. I'm in awe that Quentin Tarantino, who can spin a story like no other, bought into OLDBOY. Another prime example of writers managing to stink up a great premise. One more thing, Park's earlier film SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, while also no masterpiece, was far, far superior to OLDBOY in my opinion. Worth watching.",

I had been constantly pushed by my friend to watch Oldboy and he had always insisted on its brilliance. For quite a while, I refused to watch it believing that it would simply be another excessively gory and graphic Asian film, but I was so wrong. I have read many reviews of people criticising it for its violence, and have to admit I am not a fan of gory movies per se. However, I am okay with the occasional gore as long as it is not the main focus of the film. In Oldboy's case, violence is just a small (and necessary) part of a much bigger all. The film takes you away on a roller-coaster ride of human emotions, a brilliant plot, and sheer brilliance. The acting is absolutely superb, from the smallest to the biggest character, and has you believing all along in the storyline.

No-one escapes unscathed in 'Oldboy (2003)' and the so-called 'crimes' for which penance is being sought are so petty that when they're revealed you realise that the villain's motivations were actually to simply avoid placing the guilt upon himself (the only reasonable party). When the film reaches its heart-breaking, tragic finale it will leave you as devastated as the protagonist, before it all ends on one of the most deceivingly dark notes of the last few years. Yet, besides the fantastically well thought-out plot that's told with some brilliantly intelligent writing, the feature also relies on it's stand-out powerhouse performances and unflinching violence that, while certainly not as graphic as its reputation would have you believe, serves the dark and uncompromising story well.

If you ever thought a movie twisted the fabric of your mind as to what is and isn't possible in this modern world of cinema, watch Oldboy and I'm sure it will surpass all your previous notions. Chan-wook Park is a Korean director who specializes in incredible stylistic camera work and artistic cinematography within a carefully constructed narrative. Oldboy is the second film in his aptly named ""vengeance trilogy."" It is about a man who is imprisoned 15 years for unknown reasons. After enduring painful loneliness for all this time, he is released, only to find out he has five days to find out why he was imprisoned. It starts off strange and different, yet don't get discouraged. Everything echoes throughout the film to end with one of the most twisted and stunning climaxes I have ever witnessed. My jaw was left wide open for the last fifteen minutes of this movie, and then about ten more after the credits finished rolling. If it hadn't been so late I might have hit the play button again as soon as I made it back to the DVD menu. It was utterly mind blowing.",
95,9 August 2011,Red-Barracuda,9, An emotionally intense thriller,"This South Korean revenge story is something of a tour de force. It features a powerful central performance from Choi Min-sik, who plays a man called Oh Dae-su who is mysteriously snatched in the street and imprisoned in a sealed room for 15 years. Until he is suddenly and unexpectedly released, from here he seeks vengeance and answers. Cinematically it's very accomplished with a number of standout sequences, including an excellent extended fight scene that uses every inch of its widescreen frame in a single unbroken shot. It pulls no punches on the violence front either; there are a number of brutal scenes not for the faint of heart. So the film is both stylish and visceral. But it also has a powerful emotional core. By the end of the film after the devastating final twists, you are taken to a very dark place indeed. A very psychologically troubling place. Oldboy looks at the lows to which human beings can sink for vengeance. Although, admittedly, the villain of the piece is clearly a sociopath. His revenge on the unfortunate Oh Dae-su is, to put it mildly, over-the-top and excessive.",

The mystery of what's happening to this guy is intriguing, and as he himself tries to figure out, we get a very creative fight scene in the corridor (among lots of other things, cough, octopus). It's no wonder Tarantino liked this film so much, as its main theme is revenge, it goes for those big, squirm-inducing shock moments, and it's quite stylish. For me it fizzled a bit in the second half, as I saw more of the nemesis character and the story was revealed. Much as I tried to suspend disbelief (and not think too much about the misogyny), several big moments in the plot seemed contrived, and it seemed kind of messy, wanting focus.

It was one of those perfect moments I guess, and it was all the much harder to believe, because I am no Asian-movie fan. Actually I avoid Asian movies as much as I can because I don't like their storytelling and directing, plus I never remember the faces because they all look the same. I have, since seeing ""Oldboy"", changed my opinion on that. How could I not, the movie has more style that the first two Matrix movies combined, visual effects that are more than equal rivals to any big-budget Hollywood movie, actors that I was somehow able to recognize were amazing, despite having to read the subtitles all the way through, and a music score that has been playing in my head for many days now. And I haven't even gotten to the true core of this movie. It's a story that blew me away, it's a hardcore revenge movie that won't leave you cold.

This movie has a subject that starts like a Kafka story of an individual facing an unknown repressive machine, but turns quickly in a sordid and personal revenge run that would be worth of the hand of Tarantino. I am sorry to use Western cultural references, but this is the best way to describe my impressions. There is actually much more deepness, a troubling, shocking but yet so human story beyond the action story line. There are tons of graphic violence and some sex, but they did not seem shocking to me because they were very much in the logic of the story. Acting is superb, and the story line, including the ending is perfectly logic. I am hearing that Hollywood intents to do a re-make and I fear the results.

117,1 November 2005,Jonny_Numb,7, an unusual yet mesmerizing revenge fable,"I will admit right off that bat that I'm not a fan of the whole ""Asian Extreme"" phenomenon sweeping across North America right now; as far as horror goes, my heart is grounded in the Spaghetti Splatter of Fulci and Argento; as for revenge, Charles Bronson always ""makes the bloodlust grow fonder."" ""Oldboy"" takes a bit from both: a man is imprisoned for 15 years without any apparent purpose, and vainly attempts to break free of his shackles; once he does, he seeks out those who put him there, and embarks on a stylized--yet strangely 'civilized'--killing spree. For much of its running time, my reaction to ""Oldboy"" was a stupefied ""huh?"" It has a plot as excessively complicated as a '70s giallo, and often drifts quite far from reality (not really griping, as it provides the film with a disorienting, surreal sheen), but is simply mesmerizing. From the standpoint of visuals and camera work alone, ""Oldboy"" is as beautiful to look at as Dario Argento's ""Deep Red."" However, like Argento, the characters are less prone to expressing their feelings outside the requirements of the plot, and while there is a striking humanity underneath the bloodshed of ""Oldboy""--it simply isn't enough to elevate it above its own obsession with surface quality. Too bad, seeing as how the potential for greatness is certainly present.",

147,9 December 2008,KingM21,8, One of the best films I watched in 2004.,"Oldboy, a Korean action thriller, is one of the best films I watched in 2004! Oh Daesu, on his way home to celebrate his daughter's birthday, finds himself kidnapped and placed in a small apartment-like room. Despite his attempts to find out why, he is never told anything over the 15 years he remains prisoner there! During the time in his cell, he stays busy by attempting suicide, watching TV, trying to escape, and preparing for when he does get out. It is at that time Oh Daesu will begin his violent, disturbing quest for answers. No more needs to be said, as this is a film best left revealed as you watch it for the first time. I will mention one scene for the action fans though. Oh Daesu, on his way out of a building, starts into a hall and encounters a whole gang of punks prepared to stop him. Armed with a mere claw hammer, our hero smashes his way to the other end, realistically dishing out pain (and taking his share of it back!). We witness this awesome scene of action beauty unfold over the course of about three minutes, scrolling from the left to the right, and with absolutely no cuts! Anyway, with its unique and suspenseful plot, great characters and acting, and sharp sense of style and music, Oldboy was an impressive feature. The film was less than a year old and a remake was already in the works! If you get the chance, I definitely recommend watching it.

151,14 August 2021,x_manicure_x,10, Daring,"""Oldboy"" is a messed-up double revenge story that never holds back and takes risks over compromises. Instead of the slightly more realistic, social critique-oriented approach of ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"", Park Chan-Wook goes for an overly stylized, pulpy but elegant approach here, almost to retain some kind of connection with the Japanese manga the film is loosely based on. It feels silly and caricatural at first, but things get more and more engaging after you start connecting the dots and noticing how each shot is carefully constructed, how the action scenes are tastefully choreographed, how inventive ad original the mise-en-scene is every time. The mystery behind Dae-su's captivity is what drives the whole narrative, but the stylish visuals are enough alone to keep you engaged on multiple views.",

The ""intensity"", an obsession and a goal in itself with this director, is served up with the cheapest of means. Let's not confuse a mindless shot of adrenaline with artistic worth. By the end of the movie, it seems that all the cards were exhausted so the script becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of ""horror"", to continue to ""shock"" an audience which is already numbed by the plethora of dumb soap-opera ""revelations"" already served up in big bunches.

Oldboy received good reviews, so i rented it out. It has a brilliant unique storyline, with a disturbing and shocking twist and ending. The movie is about a man that gets mysteriously kidnapped and finds himself in a room locked. Not a prison, just a room, with a bed and TV and he receives food. The days turns into years, and after 15 years he is suddenly released. He is given a phone and message on not Why did this happen to him, but Why was he released. Sounds a little daft, but for those who have seen this movie, if you think about it, it makes sense. It is absolutely bizarre and not for the weak hearted. Oldboy had some magnificent violence that was recorded excellent. There is a fight scene, where he takes on 15 guys on his own in a hallway. The 2 minute fight scene was recorded in one camera take, and looks brilliant. Great performances, I still recommend this movie to anyone looking for a challenge.",

While I like how the director, Chan-wook Park, handled the revenge, the move as a whole was TERRIBLE. Oldboy is only billed at 1 hour and 55 minutes long but it feels like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. I will say that the English dubbing was done very well and the movie was easily understandable. I felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and a lot of the dialogue repeated itself. Also, if you have an aversion to annoying voices, then avoid hearing Hye-jeong Kang (she plays Mi-do) speak. If you are looking for a movie to kill time and make you feel morally superior to others, then watch away.

174,11 January 2011,Tubular_Bell,3, Never such abysmal content has been presented with such brilliant style,"If you've watched a few films off the Saw franchise, you probably know what it is to watch a ""torture porn"" film with a completely ludicrous, ridiculous story, with a style ripped-off from awful MTV videos. Oldboy is exactly like that, with the difference that the style is actually brilliant and gorgeous beyond words. But what's the use of great cinematography, mood and beautiful imagery when its sole point is to deliver a story like this? I have NEVER seen a story so richly pointless, absurd and unrewarding. Yeah, I can deal with films that make ""no sense"", that have ""no meaning"" or things like that; sometimes that's what the director is going for. But the trouble here is that you, as a viewer, is supposed to RELATE to this story, to feel attached to it, as if it could be actually happening. You're intended to connect with the protagonist, or something like that, and that is simply unimaginable. The story is written with the sole purpose of being shocking and disturbing, and that's ALL there is to it. Trust me: the twists and surprises along the way will give you no reward whatsoever, it's just there to shock and disturb you. And if you want to be shocked and disturbed, why not go watch films that address TRULY shocking and disturbing things that are happening around the world, instead of a stupid ""torture porn"" fantasy of a filmmaker? Yeah, Oldboy is not ""torture porn"" in the same strict sense as Saw and Hostel, but in the end, that's pretty much what's going on. And actually, it is doubly so: not only the characters are being tortured, but so is the audience. Ignore the hype and leave this Asiatic garbage aside. No, the beautiful cinematography is NOT worth it.",

When rating a film the most important thing should be, what is the film giving the audience and what is the message that the director is pushing across. In this film the message is not much smarter than your average horror flick, and the only feeling you have after seeing it is disgust. That's not really a bad thing, if it has direction. In films like Seven there is and it can be summed up really easy in the last sentences from Morgan Freeman. ""The world is a beautiful place and worth fighting for. I agree with the last part.""

178,14 May 2005,plutokennedy,4," Good beginning, weak ending","'Oldboy' has a very intriguing premise: A man has been locked up for 15 years in a private prison by unknown people. No reason has been given for this punishment. After he is finally released, he tries to find out who imprisoned him and what their motives are. The first part of the movie is very good. The plot is a little bizarre but you simply want to know what is going on. Once the puzzle start coming together, things are falling apart. The movie may still work for some as a morality tale, but those who desire at least a little bit of realism (and the first half of the movie certainly encourages this expectation) will be sorely disappointed. This is certainly not the first movie that uses hypnotism as a cheap and highly unrealistic plot device for mind control, but in the 21st century one should expect the authors to know better. This is a shame, as direction, photography and acting are fine. With a better resolution of the plot and a slightly less playful style this could have been a winner.",

I'm still struck on how balls-to-the-wall director Chanwook Park goes with his story. It's actually not a bad story, but it needs a certain push and originality in drive to make it work. For some this will be overkill, and it's not without an argument. The film is violent, though perhaps not on the level of Fukasaku or Miike's films. It's disturbing, but in a way that hits deep by way of raw emotions that can only come out of East Asian cinema. And it has a level of drama that's staggering, maybe for some a little far-fetched.

In my opinion, this is more like a Japanese movie than a Korean movie. Some violence and sickness are totally unnecessary. I know that they tried to tell a thriller or suspension-like plot to attract audience. But why use such a sick and fake story? When you find out the truth at the end, you will feel very sick, I promise you. I don't know why this movie tried so hard to mimic Japanese movies. I watched several Korean TV series, most of them were pretty good. Nothing like this movie. I'm so disappointed. Why did this movie get so high rating?",

First, let me get this off my chest. A lot of people either love this movie or hate it with a passion. The ones who love it are the one's who choose to give something a chance, have an open mind, and already know the best stuff is being made outside the US. The ones who hate this movie well, never mind, it's not worth filling up this space. I did like this movie a lot. Liked it when I first got introduced to it in 2003 by friends in Korea and I still feel it holds up to most movies in its genre. The story in summary is explained by others who've posted review and synopses of the plot so go there to read it but to compare this to Count of Monte Cristo is a bit dumb. Maybe if you stretched it you can see the comparison but come on, seriously? Fans of go-for-broke revenge plots in the vein of Seven will love this movie as it is the closest thing to it. Certainly it has some plot elements that are going to make American audiences squirm but it is a Korean movie not an American movie. Don't be detracted by the people who've given this such negative reviews. It's VERY raw and sometimes brutal but it is a revenge movie at its core. Also, I don't know what ""gore"" people are referring to in this movie as there is no gore. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is gore. Brutality yes, gore? Hardly. Tarantino wished he could have directed this movie, 'nuff said. This movie rightly deserves it's rating.",

How does a writer comes up with this kind of story. It Unbelievable and hard to digest. Performances are too good. Preclimax and climax are outstanding.

The movie itself has attributed a rather love it or hate it personality during its introduction to the American public and its rather explicit and disturbing scene for sex.

I watched this very close to watching ""The Punisher"" and would be hard pressed to say why this is lauded as a masterpiece and ""The Punisher"" is pulp. The plot is pretty well incoherent, which given the nature of what one can make out is just as well. The acting is awful. The ludicrous fight scenes make WWF look realistic, and teeth pulling was far more sinister in ""Marathon Man"". ""Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance"" is far better (though very short of being a great film) but the risible ""Lady Vengeance"" and this suggests that Park is the latest over-hyped Asian talent.",

On that count, it does not disappoint. It is a chilling depiction of a man who has been imprisoned for 15 years without knowing the reason for this punishment. The performance of Chao Min Sik is absolutely phenomenal. By portraying Oh Dae-Su, he completely owns the role and shows the desperation and want for revenge effortlessly. This is not a film for the weak-hearted as it contains several scenes of graphic violence which can't be handled by everyone. A must-watch for all cinema-lovers, this one can definitely rival the best movies that have come out of Asia.

Along with Mi-do, to save those he cares about most, Oh-Daesu is given 5 days to figure out who imprisoned him and why.

The theme is about revenge and how it destroys one person. After viewing it, it left me silent for more than five minutes to contemplate on what I have seen. It was simply a master piece. It has proved that Koreans are one of the most creative when it comes to cinema. But mind you, this film is not for everyone. Es pecially for the weak at heart. Aside from revenge, it touches subject on incest as well. Nevertheless, it is a MASTERPIECE. The acting is world-class in this film. Choi Min-sik and Yu Ji-tae were simply amazing as Oh Daesu and Lee Woo-jin res pectively. Credit should also be given to Gang Hye-jung as Mido. The characters are given emotional de pth that one could sy mpathize for. They were not simply categorized as either good or evil but they were allowed to feel raw emotion. The direction was also spectacular from Park Chan-wook. And the soundtrack was mesmerizing. This is definitely a must-see es pecially for people who love another kind of entertainment.

238,25 April 2020,yuenyeeac,7, About Incest,"The brutal and almost perverted revenge caused by an unfavorable love is bound to be achieved by causing another unfavorable love. Ignoring the fierce bloody and psychological distortion process for a while, the theme of the film is clearly cleared in a clearer way. This incident of incest is faced with the brave posture of resistance shown by today's powerful ethical and moral system, and some kind of interpersonal crisis of modern people revealed in this stiff and unpretentious posture.
Just as Marquez said in his magical realism masterpiece, the end of incest-a person with a pig tail, modern biological science can also testify to it, incest will lead to deformity of future generations due to the similarity between genes. However, the reason why incest has become a taboo is not such a biological reason. To trace back the history of mankind with the population of the earth today, we can simply make a simple estimate of the population of thousands of years ago or even ancient times, and then we have come up with an impossible number. Such a fact of population growth. This incident proves that incest is not a long-forbidden and rare, but a basic fact of human beings for millions of years. The reason is very simple, it is just a small number of people. In fact, it is difficult to imagine a social organization without incest. Because incest succeeded in preparing the network of in-laws, it enabled the continuation of society, and people in any society without it would be unsustainable.
The birth and reproduction of human beings, from the necessary combination of men and women to family construction to today's monogamy, is a long evolutionary story. From the initial biological, physical, and slowly to the so-called cultural and social evolutionary path of today. One of the basic premises for its realization is the gradual increase in the number of people, so that people no longer have to choose whom to combine from in-laws; at the same time, another more important reason is not fertility distortion, but incest. The disorder caused by human relations makes incest gradually unnecessary and further becomes a taboo.
Therefore, the original primordial incest can actually be generated naturally; now incest has become a problem again. It is actually artificial. The most important thing is of course all kinds of sexual taboo thinking, which causes the so-called sexual repression. Sex has become a shame and even a sinful thing, and the lust can't find an exit. It makes people return to the ancient stone carvings that have only direct blood relatives and only a few heterosexual blood relatives in disguise. . In this way, incest seems to have gone from the ancient ""naturally forced"" occurrence to today's ""artificially forced"" occurrence. And this is the most important reason for the film to be almost invisible but concealed under the modern incest system.
Finally, in the wilderness and snow of the desert, the father realized the detached love with his daughter by choosing to forget. This scene is like the ancient moment when humans are scattered in the earth, but the truth is that this is an extra-legal place free from ethics and social taboos. Love itself is not guilty, even if it is not good, who has hurt it? In fact, it is meaningless to discuss the actual rationality of the ending. It is just a window that condenses the airtight cultural and moral system constructed for modern human civilization, and a buffer that dispels the pressure of the system. Belt for some people who can't bear the burden to take a breath.",

A grand prizewinner at last year's Cannes Film Festival, Oldboy has plenty of action, startling visual effects, dark humor, and an existential mystery that will linger in your mind long after the final credits have rolled.

For the next 15 years he is imprisoned (not in a typical prison), with his sole companion being TV. The rest of the story revolves around the whos and whys of what happened to him. The story is complicated and twisted, yet very compelling. For the duration of the movie I could not look away, completely captivated by the story (and waiting for it to unravel). The cinematography and soundtrack is simply stunning. My favorite scene has to be his return of the place of his incarceration (especially the hallway fight scene - reminded me of many side-scrolling video games). The fight scenes are not martial arts masterpieces, but rather realistic throw-downs (I especially like the use of a simple hammer).

The film has opened theatrically here to rave reviews, which I do not often find a good omen and several IMDb reviewers find it slow and lacking in violence and gore. Well maybe there is not as much blood as in some but it is far easier to watch an arm issue forth a fountain of blood than to watch just a second of Mr Park's gastronomic or dentistry scenes.

It starts out with throwing an innocent man to jail. The end is a complex story about why he was put in jail mixed with some other weird stuff that are totally off base and it destroys this movie. The quality of the movie falls dramatically when this so called ""revenge"" takes place. Reminded me of a action video game where you get hit by all kinds off stuff but nothing ever happens, and the enemies are too easy to beat. It's pretty slow at times too (2nd half). You see long slow flashbacks and the reason for putting him to jail along with the other weird stuff are silly. The only good thing about this movie was the first half.

""Oldboy"" was at the top because I've heard that Tarantino liked it and it was one of the most critically acclaimed films of the 2000's. After watching this film, I was in a trance. The story is based on a graphic Japanese manga. It follows a man who gets kidnapped and incarcerated by mysterious forces, spending 15 years. Through means which I can't describe in words due to the graphic nature, the man comes back to real world but is given a limit by his mysterious captor to find out the reason of his incarceration. Much of this film is filled with surreal imagery, which is also complemented by the editing. It is very violent and graphic-possibly the most violent film I've seen.

274,7 October 2006,weownyoursoul,4, The tyranny of plot over character.,"This film has no soul. Thats my main problem with the film really. It has no soul. Sure the film looks fantastic, sure it supposedly deals with the often popular and heady subject of revenge in a brash, bold way but it does it in a way that is needlessly gratuitous and wholly sensational. The long, side-scrolling fight scene which is very striking and original is entirely unnecessary and drawn out. A clear cut case of style over substance, which is apparent throughout most of this film. And it suffers heavily from a certain style of writing that seems to be symptomatic of substandard east Asian filmmakers. The idea that drama and powerful film-making are the result of a cumulative effect. That is, if you add enough elements that are recognisably powerful and dramatic, you will end up with a powerful, dramatic film. For example, suicide is very striking and powerful, revenge is dramatic, unrequited love is dramatic, a character unable of feeling human emotions is a powerful statement. The problem is that this film amongst other Asian films (eg. hero, Samaritan girl) tries to imitate truly powerful films, without an understanding of what made those films powerful in the first place, thus creating a dramatic atmosphere by carelessly throwing all these features together without the slightest care for how it effects the characters that it subjects these ""dramatic"" events to. What you are left with are alien characters, that no human being can possibly relate to or comprehend, that have no soul of their own, but are merely devices, allegories and playthings of the sensational directors that use them. In short what you have here, in this highly praised and touted film is the tyranny of plot over character and ultimately the death of character.",

Old boy is the second movie of his revenge trilogy (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance - 2002, Oldboy and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance - 2005). Oldboy is by far the best movie of the trilogy and one of the best Asian films of all time.

284,20 April 2007,zarplex2003,6, Way Over-hyped,"I thought this was possibly one of the stupidest, most melodramatic, over hyped movies ever recommended to me. First of all, I'll admit that I don't like the movie Se7en. If you DO like Se7en, then you may like Oldboy. However, I DO like David Fincher. In particular I like his use of still imagery, high contrasting colors, etc. This director borrowed a lot from that. I also like the scenes where the main character is stuck inside a prison for 15 years without explanation. However, when I learned at the end that he was put into the prison because an arch-rival of his wanted to go to an excruciating extent to seek revenge on him for what I thought was the most ridiculous reason, I was so ticked off. First of all, his arch rival dropped his sister off the bridge, okay? She could've lived, but he was being such a drama queen and decided to drop her off the bridge because she was being such a drama queen. And why was she being such a drama queen? Because the main character started a rumor that she slept with his arch-rival (that is, they had incest). So his arch rival killed his sister because he was being a drama queen because she was being a drama queen. And after he did that, he apparently thought it was worth sticking the main character into prison for 15 years and tricking him into sleeping with his daughter. How does the main character react when he finds this out? He apologizes in the most melodramatic way and proceeds to cut his tongue out. Uhmmm... he already slept with his daughter, I don't know why he felt it was worth getting his arch rival's apology so bad that he felt he had to cut his tongue out to get it. Also, they connect the main character eating a live squid with his arch rivals very well thought out plan to get him to sleep with his daughter. That was such a stupid attempt at trying to make everything have meaning within this movie. Why couldn't he have just felt like eating a live squid? I would've liked that better. I felt like the director just wanted to throw a lot of things that he felt were cool all together even though the main storyline is SO STUPID!!! And apparently people liked this SO MUCH that they're making a remake of this movie for the U.S. RARRRR!!! Well, now that I'm done venting my frustrations, I did like everything with the movie until they actually tried to make a pathetic excuse for a plot out of it. I wish there could've been a much better story as to why he was in prison for 15 years because that part was cool. But I just think the director was trying to do things because they were cool, not because it would actually be good when it was all put together. Editing is good. Production is good. Acting is good. I can't remember the music, lol. But I'm not interested in watching it again to critique it. Directing was good. Cinematography was good. But come up with a better plot please. For these reasons I think it deserves a 6/10. I think a less produced movie with more thought put into the storyline would've been WAY better. I'm already used to seeing Hollywood churn out overproduced movies. These things don't impress me.",
285,9 February 2010,harryteja2,10, A masterful psychological thriller,I ran across this movie by shear chance. I assumed it would be just another action flick but I was proved wrong. I was confused half and hour into the movie.But around the 1 hour mark it pulled me right in. The ending is what make the movie such an masterpiece. They could have just as easily put in a dumb fight sequence and it would have become a forgettable movie But instead we get one of the greatest twist in movie history. The acting is fantastic. Both the leads and villains deliver all guns. The movie uses dark grim images. In fact most of movie is shot indoors or during night. Dialouge is another thing that stands out as there are many quotable lines. The movie also has its funny moments. The comedy is usually dark but provides some relief for the viewers Personnaly I loved this movie. But it does contain strong violence and deals with some countervail issues. Hence wont recommend it for kids. But for mature movie lovers it is a must see.,

What we see  or what we think we see  is misleading, however, and gives us an appropriate introduction to Park's remarkable yet flawed saga. The opening scene echoes a much later, pivotal, moment that holds the key to the entire mystery, and neatly encapsulates one of the themes of OLDBOY  the passing of time, its resonance, the power with which control of another person's time endows us, the manner in which what is a trivial moment in time for one person can be the irreversible beginning of life-altering tragedy for another. OLDBOY is also a study of revenge, of its nature, and of the way vengeance can destroy the person who seeks it more completely than the person on whom it is intended. ",

Chan Wook Park's latest installment of his Revenge series is clearly a work of superior art. The real winner here are the makers of the movie, the direction, cinematography, music, actors , their performance is immense and simply brilliant. The plot is complex but revolves around the life of Oh Dae Su getting abducted and locked in a prison for 15 years for no reason whatsoever. Then one day just like 15 years earlier he is released for one reason, to find he was locked. The rest of the movie shows how he achieves this and what are the twist and turns to achieve the same. The people who he meets during this time are really the real bearers of this story and the uniform brilliance in acting really makes the whole time spent on the movie worthwhile. The movie is very stylish, very graphic with blood and gore, very touchy on some I think this masterpiece is not given enough recognition over other similar movies. I hope this movie is never remade in any language since the subtle brilliance will definitely be lost in translation.

This is how he learns that his wife has been killed and the police suspect him. His pointless and incomprehensible detention reaches a determined inner revenge after initial despair. He is released 15 years later, without any explanation. This basic story could be, done badly full of clichés, or it could be the way Park Chan-wook staged this revenge movie going on indefinitely. The main concept is based on trust. The protagonist Oh Dae-soo doesn't know who to trust and who will help someone who has been detained for 15 years for his own entertainment. The amount of gore and violence the director brought to the screen was never so faithfully shown. All nudity, all tooth extractions, self-tattoos, injuries, are all portrayed realistically.
Min sik-choi fantastically brings the desperate average man who, in the midst of all ordeals, is trying to survive and take revenge.

As as such, much is lost in translation. incest between brother and sister, between a father and his daughter are the subject and are not only consumed on screen they are in a way condoned by the director who views them as to love stories that deserve to be let to blossom. The plot holes and inconsistencies that defy common sense are too many to even bother listing and my in themselves be enough to make the movie risible but you also have to add to them the numerous sadistic as well as masochistic scenes that leave you with a sense general malaise. Not a single character in this movie has an interesting arc or motivations that make sense and the revenge plot quickly appears to be a weak pretext. Although well photographed and scored, this movie is disgusting and evil at its core and one feels dirty after watching it. Don't let anyone fool you with a supposedly artistic nihilist approach.

One of the most incredible performances ever by Choi (the acting all around is spectacular, but he stands out above the rest), great directing, the corridor scene is just pure glee, one of the most ingenious plots and story line twists of all time, and believe it or not, the movie is extremely funny in some parts (the whole, ""now let me tell you my story"" part is hilarious, just to name one example). However what really shows the quality of OldBoy is that it's not just a excellent conglomerate of all those things that make a movie good, it was how it affected you. OldBoy is a extremely deep and psychological movie on the level as well as the carnal level, and it gets better every time you see it. If you think you can handle the content, and don't mind subtitles, then this film is a absolute must see. Overall, this is quite possibly the best revenge drama of all time.",

322,31 May 2011,MorgothsReach,10, A Modern Classic That Raises The Bar For Future Films,"Can you take revenge on someone for imprisoning you if you do not know the reasons behind their actions? This is one of the notions that permeates Park Chan-wook's 'Oldboy' that sees an ordinary man, Oh Dae-su(Choi Min-sik) imprisoned inexplicably for 15 years before being abruptly released and given 5 days to find out who locked him away. Opening with a terrified man being hung over a building by his tie, Oldboy never lets up in its furious pace as an urgent Dae-su attempts to piece together the reasons for his incarceration. Aiding him in his trials is the young chef Mi-do(Kang Hye-jeong) whose attachment to Dae-su is out of mutual loneliness and a secret unknown to either. Much more than an average revenge thriller the likes of which Hollywood continually regurgitates, 'Oldboy' focuses on the themes of isolation and of revenge itself as Dae-su uses his prison television as a companion during his separation from society as well as feeling and sniffing the first man he encounters after his release. Mi-do, in addition, recounts how she once saw a six foot ant in her train travelling home in a stylistically eccentric scene that references her assertion that lonely people imagine ants. As with the other two components of his Vengeance Trilogy - 'Sympathy for Mr Vengeance' and 'Lady Vengeance' - 'Oldboy' examines the nature of revenge itself and how the futility of it brings no closure but only more pain. This is apparent when it becomes clear to the audience that Dae-su's revenge is not the only one at work. Choi min-sik puts in a powerhouse performance as Oh Dae-su portraying the immature drunk from the opening of the film then descending into desperation and anguish before excelling as the post-captive Dae-su whose thirst for vengeance gives way to a more sadistic character who thrives on both receiving and administering pain. In the standout scene of the film - the now famous tracking shot - Dae-su fights 20+ thugs in a narrow corridor with a knife lodged in his back before smiling nonchalantly as an elevator opens to present even more assailants to him. In a film full of classic scenes this is one of the most exhilarating as we watch Dae-su cleave through his enemies like a force of nature. We are never in any doubt that he will win the fight; we simply sit back and admire the choreography and sound effects of Dae-su's callus hardened fists meeting various parts of anatomy with a force that is going to do more than just tickle. Kang Hye-jeong likewise puts in a tragic performance as the ill-fated Mi-do: the image of innocence who is corrupted by two opposing evils. In a powerfully symbolic scene Mi-do adorns a pair of angel wings, unaware of their significance as Dae-su's terrible scream roars across the screen. As Dae-su's captor, Lee Woo-jin, Yu Ji-tae delivers a twisted performance as the obsessive mastermind whose imprisonment of the protagonist is only the precursor to his elaborate plot. As the wealthy recluse, Ji-tae portrays a man perfectly in control who in his final scene descends into grief-stricken remembrance that allows the audience to understand but not condone his machinations. In his crafting of 'Oldboy' Chan-wook has delivered a modern classic that will stay with audiences long after the credits roll. Not simply a thriller but a meditation on the destructive force of revenge nowhere is this better epitomised than the final scene where Dae-su's lingering smile slowly fades into a grimace as he embraces Mi-do in the snow.",

Oldboy is one of those films that starts out strong, builds you up the whole way through, and then ends with a bang, leaving you satisfied and thinking back at what a great film it was. It follows a lonely man who has many problems but refuses to face them. The movie guides him through a healing path where he discovers the mistakes he made in his life and as a result pays the consequences for them. It really makes the viewer draw many parallels between his or her life and the life of our tragic hero in the film. Not to mention it is beautifully filmed. The choreography in a rather impressive sequence involving some torture and a fight scene involving a hammer (I won't say much more for sake of avoiding spoilers) was fabulous, almost a bit Matrix-esquire.

There's nothing about the movie that I did not like, absolutely nothing. And I think it's better than ""Kill Bill"" in every respect, in fact, much better. After watching director Park's ""CUT"" from the ""Three... Extremes"" anthology and being very impressed, ""Oldboy"" seals the deal that this is the director to watch. Superbly filmed, amazing performances, a dynamite soundtrack, and a story that will linger in your thoughts long after the credits roll. I still can't get over the feeling I had when the twist is revealed. Just absolutely amazing how a movie can physically take over your body, and make you visibly shaken.

An incredible Korean thriller that really packs a punch at the end (though it is a very unconventional ending and bound to bother some people). I can't really say too much about the movie without risk of giving things away... but here's the movie in a nutshell. After being bailed out of jail on a drunk and disorderly charge Oh Daesu (Min-Sik Choi) is kidnapped and confined to small apartment where he is cut off from the entire world except for a TV. His meals are brought to him through a small trap door and every now and then he is gassed into unconsciousness and his captors clean up after him. After living like this for FIFTEEN YEARS he is suddenly set free with no explanation. He vows bloody revenge on the person who did this to him but he also desperately needs the answer to the question ""why""? To say too much more would ruin the odd twists and turns. The movie gets pretty nasty at times (explicit sex and violence) but is not a senseless barrage of constant action like some Asian thrillers.

369,11 February 2014,phobonnika,10, The 2nd greatest film of all time.,"What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? After being kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years, a man is released, only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days. Number 2 sees a controversial choice: a film that has in fact been passionately set on fire with denouncement by a number of critics. Nonetheless, what I find in Oldboy is comfort of a strange kind. What Park Chan-wook creates in his twisted and surreal world is an untouchable empathetic consistency. The protagonist, named Oh Dae-su (Min Sik-choi), is quite frankly the most three dimensional, intriguing, inspiring and hard-hitting character ever to grace the screen. His conduct is real yet fantastic, defiant yet compassionate. Aside from Oh Dae-su's remarkable and unmatchable persona, sweetly showcased by his narration of the taxonomy of rock bream whilst indifferently wearing a stolen pair of women's sunglasses, or as he walks away, undisturbed by the suicide-by-falling of a man he has just told his story to, and what this brings to not just the film as a whole but its ability to connect with a certain breed of audience, the directing is arguably flawless. If one only has five minutes to spare, I recommend taking what could just be the most impressive scene of stature and presence in the history of cinema: the corridor fight scene, shot over four days (it is a continuous one take with only correction of punches comprising the totality of the computer editing intervention), where we are shown a trademark of the calibre of filmmaking that Oldboy contains. I've never seen anything like it. I watch it again and again, dumbstruck to its perfection, as composer Jo Yeong-wook's magnificent and moving score sombrely serenades over the visuals. Oldboy touches on some controversial and taboo subjects which deter the average viewer, but to the trained eye what Park has done with them is to create a piece of cinema that rip-roaringly strips back the layers of the heart to ultimate bareness, whilst still including some of the best action shots in any film to date. Oh Dae-su's tormented soul, battered and bruised both physically and mentally throughout, compliments the captured transition of his mental state into a 'monster' as well as the finest white wine with fish. Lee Woo-jin's distress, his patience and craftsmanship of a bizarrely pleasurable witty kind of sociopathic torture is portrayed with uncompromising genius: studying the sheer power of the final scenes in his penthouse and his ultimate relinquish into decline is taxing and infesting. Many cast Oldboy aside as a publicity stunt, and fail to see past the octopus. What I'm trying to say, in the end, is that Oldboy earns its place as the second greatest film ever made because of how is depicts the depth that human emotion can delve to.",

However, Chan-wook Park's style is no holding back and he tells this warped twisted tale. Is this movie about mindless violence and vengeance. It definitely factors in, but I felt it was about transformation. Daesu, played with gusto by Min-sik Choi, is such a perplex character that you find yourself rooting for him, yet appalled at his actions. He is forced to review his life (very involuntarily) and what he's become. I don't even want to go beyond that, but think about your past, your present, and the individual you've become. Are you pleased or satisfied? Would you have done anything differently? Would you reject people who you'd previously greeted with smiles and called friends or would you seek out those who you may have unjustly wronged? That's what Oldboy is about. The journey of life and the consequences of actions taken. That's why Min-sik Choi is so superb in that he really becomes Daesu and from the start to finish, you become fascinated, even obsessed with finding the path he takes. The cast work well here and this may be one of the most intense films I've had the pleasure of seeing. Oldboy may be a huge step for korean cinema, but it really is one fantastic movie.",

Visually it was an extremely impressive movie. There were some shots that seemed on the verge of being truly beautiful with some cool color themes, but they always fell short. The one fight scene that the movie is famous for is really one of the most impressive fight scenes I have ever seen. It was nice mix of powerful action that really gave us a feeling of the character's desperation. The relationship between the main characters always felt forced to me and the hypnosis explanation never sat well with me. I guess it explained the reason why the relationship felt forced and out of place, but without a meaningful character relationship the movie felt hallow.

430,20 September 2014,FilmCriticLalitRao,10, Oldboy : A Park Chan Wook film which has divided viewers into two different camps.,"Park Chan Wook's film ""Old Boy"" has divided viewers into two different camps. On the one hand there are many viewers who have voiced their positive opinions about it. On the other hand, there are also some viewers who have not been able to understand this film and its message of revenge. Whatever one might say, there is no point in going into details regarding this film's popularity neither would it be worthwhile to discuss its notoriety. All that can truly be said about ""Old Boy"" directed by Korean iconoclast filmmaker Park Chan Wook is that it can make one learn more about a Korean person's psyche. This aspect of human behavior is revealed in the character of Oh Dae Su whose role has been amazingly played with heavenly aplomb, tremendous maturity and remarkable agility by Korean actor Choi Min Sik. A film critic has to be trusted when he states that a film like this has not been made in the recent past. This is one of those rare Asian films which doesn't walk on the crutches of exotic Asian elements even for a second. There is one sincere advice for the Victorian prudes who criticized the scene in which an Octopus is eaten alive. Kindly have a look at Pasolini's film ""Salo"". Compared to that film the octopus scene appears like an angelic infant. Those viewers who lambasted the portrayal of incest, it must be told that it has always been a part of human civilization since olden times. Hence, why are some people making unnecessary noises now about its depiction ? The best thing about ""Old boy"" is that it makes us aware of the fact that the time connection is extremely important for all of us. Everything about the film is brilliant indeed mind boggling. Whether it is catchy music, quick pace, ample suspense, raw violence or maudlin melodrama. ""Old boy"" is a first class product in the truest sense of the word. It is a film which gives its viewer complete value for money. Whichever format one chooses to watch this film, it is surely going to rest in the viewer's mind for a long time.",

It has lot of twists that are not easily foreseeable and the powerful emotional acting of the main characters is just astounding. Style and artistic tricks and effects are of great variety and amazement. Editing starts like a badly done home made film but gradually gets more refine and delivers the end as a masterpiece. The cinematographic close ups deliver strong emotion but also humor. The film keeps its strong national style and that makes it still more interesting.

"" - Oh Dae Su","It's rare that I see a movie I'm so excited about, that I watch it again the day after I've first viewed it. 'Oldboy' is one of the rare movies, a hyper-active energetic gore-fest with Tarantino undertones from South Korean filmmaker Chan-Wook Park. The film surrounds a thirty-something year-old businessman Oh-Dae Su (Min-Sik Choi) who pretty much gets wasted every night after work. One night he is kidnapped by mysterious captors and help prisoner in a window-less room that looks like a hotel room. He has now inter-action with anyone for 15 years inside there, so he starts to make a list of all the people he's ticked off in the last decade or so. One day he wakes up in an extra-large suitcase on top of an apartment building roof. From there he goes on a mission to find his long-lost daughter and to find whoever did this to him and exact revenge (a.k.a. = he's going to kill their ass!) Along the way, he befriends and falls in love with a young female sushi chef, Mi-Do (Hye-jeong Kang) who helps him on his journey. The feature also stars Ji-Tae Yu, Dae-Han Ji, Dal-Sul Oh, Byeong-OK Kim, Seung-Shin Lee and Jin-Seo Yun. Chan-Wook Park's directing is stellar to say the least while the acting is top-notch 100%. Min-Sik Choi gives a riveting performance as our hero, while Hye-jeong Kang does alright with her role. Dae-Han Ji and Dal-Sul Oh provide much needed humor for this crime-mystery while Ji-Tae Yu creates one of the most effective villains in recent years. 'Oldboy' isn't a film for everyone and if you don't have the stomach for it make sure you avoid it. But, for those with the same flair and passion for great cinema as me, I would definitely encourage you to give it a whirl. 'Oldboy' has very few flaws and a lot to love about it. Grade: B+",

We watched it again, right after. I've seen it over 10 times by now and it was an entertaining watch (at the least) every time. I told myself, if there where movies made by Asians out there, THIS GOOD, then I can't just sit by and not watch them. I got off my lazy ass and searched the Internet from top to bottom and I've been rewarded greatly.

488,29 October 2022,Horst_In_Translation,6," Relatively old movie by now, but still a good watch despite some flaws","""Oldeuboi"" or ""Oldboy"" or ""Old Boy"", but not (Gary) Oldman or Old Man, is a South Korean film in the Korean language that was filmed in Busan in South Korea, so the direction here is clear. The movie is from 2003, which means it will have its 20th anniversary soon and if you look at the quantity of ratings this title has received on imdb, you will immediately understand that it is among the most defining films from Korea and also from Asia from the 21st century. And if you also look at everything else that was done in Korea movie-wise in the last over 20 years, then you know what that means. The 8.4-rating and the film being currently at #70 in the imdb top250 is also self-explanatory. This has the potential to be seen as a classic in the future, even if I would not go this far as you can see from my rating. But first things first: The director is of course Park Chan-wook and this was not from the early days of his career. He had already been active for about a decade in terms of shooting projects at that point, but still you see that he will turn 60 soon now, so this means that also he did not start making movies at a really young age either. As always, he was also the writer or was one of the writers I should say of this film that runs for exactly two hours. If we look at the other two, Minegichi and Tsuchiya, you will find one name who has drawn really many mangas that got turned into films at some point while the other has Oldboy only in his credits and also of course the American version by Oldboy that got made a decade later by Spike Lee and starring Josh Brolin. That one did not turn into a big success, so most people rather stay with the original. I have not seen that American version though, so I cannot talk about differences and parallels here, but I found Lee always a bit on the overrated side and lacking subtlety with his approach to everything, so I am not surprised at all.",

You see the characters torment. Some very witty lines shine too with him wondering whether imaginary TV training can carry into the real world. However the violence often becomes too much of a spectacle and at times too glorified. While the visual content sometimes I question, the style and make-up of the cinematography is well done. Unfortunately as is often the case with movies - the ending suffers; the twist is more for shock value and very predictable - they would've done better going a traditional route with it, or at least something with a little more integrity. Also, the final suicide is absolutely pointless further detracting. How could the father make that decision also?? Anyway, worth a look if you can handle the utter lack of integrity to stoop to for entertainment's sake I guess - are you entertained by immoral, base, and twisted ideas? If so enjoy.",

Like ""Squid Game"" and a number of Bong Joon-ho's movies - and probably other movies from South Korea - it paints a grim picture of that country, depicting it as tainted by corruption (and if your response is that it's a different culture, I'd like to remind you that corruption has the same result no matter where you are).",

Basically Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) is planning to see his daughter on the day of her birthday, after getting out of the police station completely drunk, but he disappears without trace. He has been imprisoned in a shabby cell with no explanation, meagre amounts of food, one range of clothes, one bed, one television, and gas that puts him to sleep every night, and he counts the time he is inside. He marks his time on his arm with tattoos, and he starts chipping his way through the wall, prepared to fall however many stories up he is, as long as he gets out. All of the sudden he wakes up coming out a trunk in a field, with fresh expensive clothes, money and a cellphone, and of course the knowledge that he was imprisoned for fifteen years, and now he wants revenge. He stops in a Japanese restaurant where he gets a suspicious phone call, and he meets chef Mido (Hye-jeong Kang), and they quickly have a strong attraction for each other. She wants to help Dae-su Oh find the ones who held in captivity, and the reason why, and he doesn't care how he gets to the truth or who gets hurt in the process. Eventually, after a few back and forth moment, Dae-su Oh concludes that it was Woo-jin Lee (Ji-tae Yu) responsible, but he tells a big secret when explaining the reasons. It wasn't just that it was saying a certain something to Mido, or that both of them were hypnotised to fall in love with each other, the reason they were was because they are already married! Also starring Dae-han Ji as No Joo-hwan, Dal-su Oh as Park Cheol-woong, Byeong-OK Kim as Mr. Han, Seung-Shin Lee as Yoo Hyung-ja and Jin-seo Yun as Lee Soo-ah. It is an interesting story, if a little vague in places, but for seeing moments like eating a live octopus, some fight scenes, and of course the teeth pulling scene (inspired by Marathon Man), it is certainly an action thriller to admire.

The mysticism along with the dark side of human nature bind together so as to hypnotize and beguile the audience. The action scenes are brutal and realistic, the kind that can actually happen.

The plot is quite simply fascinating to witness. The way it is unravelled, the narration and the direction are all fantastic; it is gripping to the point where almost two hours fly by without you even noticing. The way Chan-Wook blends past flashbacks with present goings on is very smooth and does well to further show off his obvious directing talents. The revelations at the end are extremely shocking but are done so cleverly that despite how the audience may feel about the issue in question, they must at least be impressed with how it is presented. Park Chan-Wook really does deserve an applaud for his directorial efforts in this film as it is such a stylish masterpiece and really focuses on the details, taking great care in making a great film.",

I agree the film has its problems but the acting is sterling (especially the lead guy)there are some amazing sequences of action and emotion and violence and some terrific camera-work. I hate it though when people have to react so violently when they don't like something - okay, so you disagree with some of the strong reviews and awards this film got. Fine. You didn't like it. Okay. But you all are hypocrites when you lash out at others who don't share your opinion. You liked this?? Bull****! This seems to the main thrust of many of the negative reviews and I don't get it. I get that you may not have liked OLDBOY. I have many times not liked films that the mainstream gushes over and throws awards at: I think Forrest Gump is incredibly overrated, but I don't lash out at those who embrace it. The main plot turn of this movie - guy in drunk tank, gets bailed out, stops to make phone call in the rain, boom - you wake up somewhere and you are a prisoner. If you go with that in pulp fiction kinda way - it really is quite disturbing. And the process of someone trying not to go mad, trying to work out in their mind all the people they have wronged - powerful stuff - especially when the lead actor is so strong. Plus the infamous loooong hallway fight with him and his hammer - slowly moving down the hall in all camera shot - it is great.

It is not an easy film to sit through by any means, but when the credits roll at the end, you feel as though black is white, left is right, and day is night. The villain in the film is one of the most sadistic characters to ever appear on screen, and I would he think he even gives Hannibal Lecter chills.

Okay, so you know the basic premise of this film. What is hard to convey is the sheer excellence of the performances in this film, or the artistically intriguing camera shots or even the absorbing nature of this intriguing thriller. Every scene looks stunning, the lighting and sets seem perfect from the drab prison walls that actually make you feel ill, to the cold steel of the office building with its clean lines and vapid design. Great care and attention has been taken when planning this film, and it shows. Park Chan-Wook deserves much acclaim for his direction and sheer effort in bringing this film to screen. The plot is also intriguing yet not overly complex and the pace of the film is punctuated by scenes of extreme violence which are somewhat disturbing, but never gratuitous when balanced against the nature of the world Dae-su has descended into. But all of the sets and direction only gain cachet when placed next to the performances of the two main players; Choi Min-Shik (who is simply astounding in probably his best role to date) and Yu Ji-Tae (from the enjoyable Korean horror/thriller Into the Mirror). Both men put in staggering performances of particularly extreme characters without seeming too grandiose. This baroque thriller is simply not to be missed by any fan of thrillers or Asian cinema. Yet I would warn those who have issues with screen violence and somewhat disturbing subject matter to look elsewhere. But all in all, I hold this film up as a true masterpiece, and unquestionably one of the best thrillers to be made yet.",

528,22 November 2005,gpatere-1,3, Overrated indeed.,"** contains spoilers ** We can call formulaic a movie which develops according to a well-established, consecrated and successful formula and obey some kind of narrative pattern. It can be a good rendering or version of the established formula or a bad one. In either case, it lacks originality. The logical corollary is that any formula, no matter how brilliant and awe-inspiring it may be, is prone to be depleted sooner or later. When you sit through a movie and you find it disturbingly boring without knowing the reason, it may well be the case that you've seen it before  one, twice or a dozen times. That's exactly the problem with 'oldboy': from Freud's works and Kafka's Process to Angel Heart, Memento or Spider, we've already seen or read way too many stories about someone who's trapped in a mysterious plot without knowing why, forgets a good deal about his life and then goes to hell in order to discover what's going on with him  just to find out in the end that the big secret lies in his own past, usually a dirty or tormented past which has been done away with by the character's harried mind. What changes from a movie to another - apart from the camera work and all the formal qualities which a movie may or not possess  is the past dirtiness: a murder, a rape, an incestuous relationship. You name it. I'm tired of it. ;-)",

The thing that strikes me the most about this movie is the lead actor who plays Oh-Daesu.

The photography is superb, the editing and pacing keep the viewers glued to their sits for the entire 120 minutes. And the plot itself, is an unequaled wonder. It's a Greek tragedy (or a Shakespearian tragedy if you will) set in our modern world, and yet it always looks real, much of it is due to the breathtaking performance of the cast, but they could never do it if the plot wasn't there to carry them through.

The movie is about Oh Daesu, who is mysteriously abducted on the eve of his daughter's birthday and kept in detention for fifteen years by someone unbeknown to him. He finds himself in a small room, with a television and no means of escape. He is served food through a slot in the door and put to sleep by introducing various gases through the air shaft. While he is kept captive, he hears of his wife's murder, with which he has been charged. The movie reflects the internal struggle of Daesu in coming to terms with the dire situation he finds himself in. The fifteen years fill him up with relentless hatred for his mystery captor and an unquenchable thirst for revenge. When released, he sets out to find out who was behind all this and why he was subjected to imprisonment for so long. He befriends a young girl who's a cook at a diner and seeks help of his best friend from fifteen years back in order to unlock this mystery. He finds out that his daughter was adopted while he was away and is currently in Stockholm. Very soon, his captor does reveal himself.

The premise of a man imprisoned for 15 years for no apparent reason is frightening but this is just the beginning of a series of horrors. At once scary, funny and poignant Oldboy is easily one of the best films of the last ten years, only the dreaded prospect of an American remake (possibly starring Nicholas Cage!!) leaves a bad taste in the mouth. The director's other films - JSA, Sympathy for Mr Vengeance and Lady Vengeance (the latter two part of a 'revenge' trilogy along with Oldboy) are not in the same class as this but still worth seeking out.",

556,16 September 2010,estebangonzalez10,7, Even Monsters have the right to live,"¨ Even though I'm no more than a monster - don't I, too, have the right to live? ¨ Oldboy has become a cult classic among film fans because the images in the movie are so strong, raw, and nothing like you've seen before, that they stay with you for quite some time (and I mean ¨raw¨ literally because in one scene the main character eats a live octopus, how is that for a first?). The story is very original and the twists keep on coming as the movie reaches its climatic ending. Oldboy is actually based on a Japanese Manga written by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiva of the same name. This is the second of three movies that Chan-wook Park directed of the Revenge Trilogy; the first was Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and the third Lady Vengeance. I haven't seen either of those films yet, but critics agree that Oldboy is his best one of the three. The three are also separate movies so you don't have to see them to understand the plot. Oldboy currently ranks in the IMDb top 250 films at the 113th spot so as you can see it is a much respected film among viewers. This is perhaps one of the best Korean movies I've seen, as I really didn't enjoy The Host as much as almost everyone else did. I think this is a superior movie and much more complex as well. Yes, there is plenty of violence, but it is very different from other revenge films and it really took me by surprise. The plot is a very original one, it is developed really well, and I have to admit the less you know about this movie before you see it the better because the experience is very unique. My expectations however were a little higher for this film, but it didn't disappoint either.",

You don't have to read about it later to understand what is going on.  This film is very accessible and truely horrifying.  I feel like buying this movie by the crate and giving it as a gift to those who appreciate movies and who have seen 1000s.

I wouldn't say I was hugely excited about seeing it, but I was very interested and a friend's recommendation eventually got my bum on a seat for it. Continuous discussion of the graphic nature of Oldboy had suggested that perhaps it'd be a very unpleasant two hours, but it proved an intelligent and at times deeply funny and moving study of a man imprisoned over something he is unaware of, suddenly let go after several years with no explanation other than a time limit to find out why he was locked away before a young woman is killed.",

It seems strange that a film many will call a disaster could be ranked so highly. The reason for its ranking is that despite the opinions of some it is actually an amazing film. Technically its perfect, the only problem is in the narrative, which is quite a disappointment to say the least. You spend the whole film trying to figure it, trying to untangle the mystery of his kidnapping and then when its finally revealed you are left feeling cheated, and robbed. To some it is just too much, it devalues the entire film and so the entire thing will be looked upon as a failure. However, others will overlook the ending, or at least come to terms with it and still respect its more brilliant side Oldboy walks the line between realism and insanity, yes it has its problems, but it also has many good points. It's the same with 'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance', and it is in 'Lady Vengeance' that I can only hope for a combination of both these two films better points with none of the negatives. You have to remember that it is a trilogy; each film compliments the other. You may well hate it but to say it is a bad film is just ignorant, personally I love it and give it a 10 out 10.",

Most of the credit belongs to Park Chan-wook as I've heard many of the worst implications in the film aren't even present in the source manga. He approaches the depravity with an artistic flair though, bringing life to this seedy underworld through a keen eye for colour and set composition.

I think if I were Korean i may find this less of a masterpiece, as to me this film was new and different, and reading the subtitles meant i didn't get bored easily, and if I missed a few of the words out it left more guess work which i like in a film. I hate it when films show and explain every detail of everything, and show every image possible, leaving nothing to the imagination, and to me, Oldboy didn't do this. The images that were shown were very dramatic and sometimes horrific, which i liked because i like experiencing shock and even disgust, and i have great respect for films such as this one which can bring out such emotions in me.",

I knew that one of the driving factors on my mind would be revenge and to find the beast that was responsible for the incident. I would make the monster suffer and to suffer dearly once I got my hands on him. Old Boy showed the determination of one man and what he was willing to do to find the kidnapper that led to his ordeal. It delivered much more that I read about it and that was a great sign of an independent movie. I am always willing to have more than less. If you have ever thought about any type of revenge or deep hatred for another human being, I suggest that you watch Old Boy first. It might change your mind and steer you in another direction. Old Boy was a good piece of film work and it is a must see.",

619,8 May 2014,whoislucian,10, Best movie i've ever seen,"Old Boyis a delirious, confronting ride, a movie full of visceral shocks and aesthetic pleasures: it has an explosive immediacy and a persistent afterlife, a lingering impact that is hard to shake. While it has scenes of considerable brutality, its violence is expressed in a range of ways: its shock value lies most of all in what it tells us about its characters and their emotions. Full of visual and auditory pleasures, it is a dense, carefully structured film, an enigma laid bare with merciless inevitability and moments of lyrical beauty. Some of its patterns and repetitions are apparent on a first encounter, but its intricacies need more than one viewing. It is, in the most disconcerting and disorienting of ways, an exhilarating movie.",

622,25 December 2022,VikingBurialService,8, Don't Watch this with your Parents,"This movie is incredibly well made, and also incredibly gross. I felt like I needed a shower afterwards. Basically, a man is locked in a hotel room for 15 years without knowing why, and seeks revenge when he is released. The editing and cinematography of this movie are incredible; it feel both old and new at the same time, with the colors and scenes having a blurry quality, and the cuts happening at unexpected moments, so that the whole thing keeps you on your toes. The acting and dialogue were both great. The music definitely felt like it was from the early 2000s, but I'll forgive it that because it was edited in so well. The main drawback of this movie for me is the plot. It's not slow or uninteresting, but it's extremely uncomfortable to watch. The sex, jerking off, and big reveal of the movie all give that cringing skin-feel. I wouldn't want to rewatch this movie again alone; definitely don't watch it with your parents.

625,19 January 2006,jpkwolf,8, Clever and original piece of movie making,A guy is kidnapped and prisoned for 15 years. He doesn't know why he was prisoned. Then he is released and is hungry for revenge. That's the basic plot of this movie. The story is great with many clever twists and turns. Sometimes the movie was a bit confusing but there is nothing too complicated. The movie was also a bit violent and included few realistic but cool fighting scenes although it's by no means an action movie. Hollywood is remaking this movie for the year 2006 and I think if someone like David Fincher directs and we add some great actors to the soup it could be even better for me at least. Not to say things were bad here. Just with a even bigger budget and things I can see this movie being even better if they don't change wrong things. They could sharpen the edges of this diamond.,
626,24 May 2005,waynesjohn,8, Come on Hollywood!,"I think that movies like 'Oldboy' highlight the fact that if you want to watch high-quality, thought-provoking film, then you must first check that it wasn't made in America. This leads us to an explanation for the conspicuous failure of Hollywood to actually make any money for the last few years, and a criticism of the formulaic 'blockbuster' approach to movie-making. 'Oldboy' isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it is certainly a complex and unique piece of work. Hollywood should take note, understand that things like this can sell, and regain some of the pioneering spirit that built the business in the first place.",

The presenter gave us a quick run-down of the plot, and that, along with the blurb in the TV listings did more than enough to make me want to watch. I couldn't agree more with other contributors, that the film is a work of superb surrealism, and therefore should not be taken as literally as any similar Hollywood offerings might. All in all, the best foreign language film I have seen in a long time. I would hasten to add, that the story itself is told in a fantastically twisting, to-ing and fro-ing manner which adds to the superbly crafted atmosphere of the movie. Superb!",

642,12 April 2013,farrokh-bulsara,8, Just a bridge between two masterpieces,"Differently from previous ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"", Park Chan-wook's iper-realistic and brutal aesthetics here becomes dynamic and puzzled, as its violence gets more spectacular than estranged, so more involved in entertainment than in reflection: in this sense it's an achieved film for the way it manipulates, even with a great dodge, the attention of the audience who never gives up in the suspense crescendo, plot twists, flashbacks, all mixed by sapient editing just to get us curious and intrigued. Anyway the extreme violence becomes pathetic, really excessive if not justified, self-satisfied in sadistic incursions in bad taste and in a mannerism end to itself, surely of great impact for the ability of director to shock and wonder, but not always necessary. After all the narrative machine, cerebral, confused, studied like a glove with that modern and Hollywood-a-like attitude to plot twist and ambiguity, doesn't betray the comics' source with frame shots and parallel chronological structure, but even with a certain, overblown absurdity which often cuts off of the film, visually sensational, a kind of honesty. Chased by apocalyptic music, macabre game of incest and blackmails, punishments and tortures, violence against himself, against next in line, against animals (the protagonist eat a living octopus), has some inventive flash, it's cathartic as Greek tragedy source (Sophocles' ""Oedipus the King""), but even if the passionate audience sews the wires of the story and characters, gets order in the chaos and fins solutions to the enigma, something is still missing, something unachieved and unobserved: an authentic verisimilitude for this delirium, which goes over the equilibrium between Dionysian and Apollonian , giving up to this last one and to a muddled work of mind. By the way, it's a great actor performance for Choi-Min Sik, in a still significant artwork from a certain Asiatic cinema, and from an extraordinary director. In his trilogy, this film in the middle is the less deep and the funniest one, the one in which he dared the most in terms of style and provocation, but even the most commercial and mainstream, in Tarantino pulp era.",

When he is finally released, Dae Su finds himself still trapped in a web of conspiracy and strangeness. His own quest for vengeance becomes tied in with romance when he falls for an attractive sushi chef (Gang Hye-Jung), who feeds him live octopus and who may or may not be involved with the bizarre mystery. This is all served up in a striking palette of purples and dark reds and stuffed with insanely malicious twists and turns. Choi Min-Sik is terrific in the lead,counterbalancing over-the-top hysterics with deadpan. There are intense fight scenes (Dae Su's favorite weapon is a hammer), look-away moments of torture and self-mutilation, sex, and gallons of black humor. Not for the fussy, but for those seeking something wholly original and daring, this cinematic entree is alive--it's hard to imagine a better slice of psycho-shock sensationalism.",

He runs out and - again, somehow - finds the other flat right away and there confronts the antagonist to try to find why he kept him imprisoned for fifteen years. The antagonist opens his own shirt to show him a pacemaker operation scar and a remote control device he says he paid a surgeon a ton of money for so he could switch off his pacemaker at any time and die and he'll do that if, uh, the protagonist tries to...uh...kill him?... Because, OK, yeah, no, the protagonist really wants to know what happened to him and he won't find out if...OK, yeah, it's that the protagonist can't torture the antagonist to find out because then the antagonist will die and he'll find out nothing... OK, yeah, kind of makes sense, but then the antagonist lets the protagonist know that the woman he left tied up in her flat did not betray him and is now in danger - because he, um, left the door open, which, how did the antagonist know that when he's been in the other flat the whole time? But anyway, that's all he really had to say to get the protagonist to leave and not torture him, so why didn't he just do that...? Oh, OK, only so way later in the movie the antagonist, now apparently suicidal, can toss the remote control at the protagonist who'll try to use it to kill the antagonist only to discover all it really does is play a tape of the protagonist having sex with the woman he loves - a tape that didn't exist when the device was first shown, by the way - whom he now knows to be his daughter, after which the antagonist kills himself anyway.

This movie screenplay is simply awful. The plot focuses on a man in prison for 15 years. And focuses on torture scenes and does not have much of a real story. The 2 hours that I spent watching this film was an absolute waste. And I will never get them back. Nor can I think of a worse way to spend 2 hours. This movies is also nothing but sickening images with no real purpose absolutely shocking storyline. The acting however was very good but everything else about this film is pure garbage. I don't understand how this movie got into the top 250. The only good things about this film were the acting which I will admit was very good. And the end credits when this pure junk was finally over. I have a splitting headache after watching this and I will never be able to erase this bad memory. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM! staring at a blank wall for 2 hours would be more entertaining,
