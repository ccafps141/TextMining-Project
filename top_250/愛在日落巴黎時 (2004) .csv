0,13 December 2004,ivko,10, The only problem...,"...is that it ends. This is a fantastic film. It joins the handful of movies where I think I liked the sequel even more than the original, although I liked 'Before Sunrise' as well. Where Sunrise captured the immediacy and urgency of perfect youthful love, Sunset reflects beautifully on the aftermath of that perfection. I remember a line that says ""nothing that is complete breathes"", and I think that is what we see in this film. A perfect connection with another human is a blessing and a curse; having experienced perfection a part of us stops breathing, unable or unwilling to mar the perfection of that memory.",/
1,20 November 2004,film-critic,10, I'm designed to feel slightly dissatisfied!,"I will be the first to announce that I was not a huge fan of the original film. While I thought that it was interesting to see as well as an untapped concept in Hollywood, I felt that the characters were too forced coupled with a very amateurish and repetitive moments. It was an average film that seemed to be lacking bits of the human element. It needed something more. At the time I couldn't put my finger on it, but after seeing Before Sunset, I could see what it was. Maturity. This may sound strange, but I felt that Jesse and Celine were too perfect in the first film. They lacked connectiveness to the average person. I couldn't see myself in this situation. Perhaps if I would have seen the original film in 1995 instead of a couple of years ago, it would have been closer, but I just couldn't capture the moment. In Before Sunset, I feel head over feet for both Jesse and Celine.",r
2,19 June 2004,Superunknovvn,8," Linklater, Delpy & Hawke make an impossible sequel work (including minor SPOILERS)","""Before Sunrise"" was one of the most beautiful independent love stories of the 90's. Part of its appeal came from the open ending. We didn't know how the lives of these two young people would continue and what would become of them. The whole movie was like a snapshot that left the rest to our imagination. A sequel to such a story seemed to be unnecessary, but apparently director Richard Linklater himself couldn't stop thinking about these two intriguing characters and had to envision their lives after this one fateful day in Vienna.",e
3,14 August 2004,Bob Pr.,10, Wow! Satisfying at so many levels,"I had not seen the prequel to this although my date had and she filled me in on many details. While the experience of this film would be enriched by having seen the preceding film first, it certainly stands satisfactorily alone.",v

5,16 July 2004,preppy-3,10, Just great,"A sequel to the 1995 film ""Before Sunrise"". Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and  Celine (Julie Delpy) meet 9 years after their initial meeting. They've  changed--originally they were in their 20s and full of idealism. Now  they're in their 30s--and their lives have changed in ways they didn't  predict. Like the first movie they walk around Paris this time and talk about love, life, reality, what  might have been--and it's all fascinating. Like the first film this is  basically a character study and (like the first) just incredible. It's  like catching up with old friends after 9 years apart! They've aged a  lot--Hawke looks TERRIBLE but Delpy looks OK--and life has thrown both  a few hard knocks but hearing how they survived and what they went  through is just incredible.   This is NOT for everybody (four people walked out when I went to see  it) but, for people who can deal with nonstop talk for 80 minutes it is  just great. Every single line rings true and is delivered full force by  Hawke and Delpy. The acting varies--Hawke is good (but he smiles WAY  too much)--Delpy is just superb all the way through.  This is easily one of the best films of 2004. Highly recommended.",e
6,7 March 2005,Galina_movie_fan,9," ""I know what you meant for me that day. I just want another try, I just want another night""","This film is one of my favorites from last year, along with ""Sideways"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". Is it just a coincidence that three best films of the year all deal with ability to connect with other people, with meeting one's true love and losing it, with memories that will not go away, and with possibilities of second chances?",w
7,30 November 2004,FreddyShoop,10," A great movie, and a nice break from most Hollywood trash.","This is simply one of the best movies I've seen, with very few qualifications. Maybe I should say that this is one of the best ""simple"" movies I've seen. Perhaps it is a bit like cooking, use fresh and quality ingredients and you can make something great without a lot of unnecessary stuff. Unfortunately, Hollywood just doesn't seem to have the ambition to make these type of movies anymore.",/

9,29 October 2004,johnnyb-16,10," How do you make a sequel to ""Before Sunrise""? This is how.","I'd been longing to see this one as I'd always thought 'Before Sunrise' was one of the most honest, most real films I'd ever seen, but at the same time I held off seeing the sequel from fear of disappointment. For all of you in the same position, fear not ; Linklater, Hawke and Delphy (for it has surely been a joint effort and labour of love for all three) have done us and themselves proud. I've just seen the film and despite being male and 38 I feel like Roberta Flack must have felt when she penned 'Killing me Softly' after hearing Don McLean sing 'Vincent' in concert; this is - once again - just so close to what it's all about. You want technicalities? The acting, superb; Hawke and Delphy slip right back into their characters, their mannerisms, their sometimes gauche repartee, the way they seem to fence around each other, seeming to go in for the kill then feigning, drawing backÂ…Exquisite. And then the details, the echoes of the first film in the settings but now with a world-weariness, an autumnal note and yet with still that fundamental freshness and optimism that revives the memories of Sunrise's youthfulness and reminds us, as our heroes discuss, that though time changes people, there remains an unchanging core. Just see it; this is about as good as it gets, folks.",w
10,11 February 2005,The_Void,10, A magnificent follow up to a beautiful picture,"This follow-up to the cult hit 'Before Sunrise' takes place nine years after the original masterpiece. The wisdom of making a sequel nine years later to a film that doesn't really need a sequel is questionable. Or at least it would be, if this film was anything less than brilliant. While the first film depicted an energetic and youthful romance between two young people; this sequel is a more mature tale, all about reflection. Before Sunset plays out almost as a tribute to the one night that the characters spent together in the first film, and analyses what happened to them after those events. The film takes in themes of missed opportunity and the effect that time has on character. Just like the first film, time is of the essence again and we follow Jesse, now the writer of an international best seller who meets up with Celine again, this time in Paris. The two take to the streets and begin discussing their relationship with each other, with their respective partners and how life has been treating them in the last nine years.",1
11,19 March 2007,Quinoa1984,10," what fascinates and interests almost works to annoy the viewer, but Linklater does come closest to Bergman here","Before Sunset provides us not so much a sequel as a continuing development in the lives of these characters, who are starting to embody the neuroses and deeply-held desires that neither want to admit to until it's at the most crucial and tragic of times. Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), who first met on a train in Vienna in 1994, meet again nine years later as Jessie has published a book which is based on that night they had together. He's in Paris, they meet again, and before he has his plane back to the states they talk, and talk, and talk, and unlike in the first film there are no asides. It's just two people who at first talk about concerns that came up for them the first time, if a bit more pragmatic: what it is to have concern over the environment, to live in the USA, to be involved enough in a relationship. There's even a moment of deja-vu where they talk about reincarnation and a respect for faith if not an embracing of it. But then we also get to see something much deeper in each side that Jessie's book and mere re-appearance for Celine brings out a memory that has become hyper-realized, and vice-versa.",1
12,12 September 2004,sm22281-1,10, Lovely romantic story,"I saw this movie with my husband. He is usually a die-hard fan of action thrillers, special effects and horror movies but he allows me to coax him into seeing a really thoughtful movie every once in a while. So this was my choice for the evening. Neither one of us had seen the first movie, ""Before Sunrise"", although I knew of it by reputation. Well, my husband absolutely loved the movie! He sat up and became totally engrossed in the story, frequently patting my hand at intervals as he identified with the the characters in the story. He forgot about the dreadful uncomfortable movie seat. He let up a big sigh of disappointment when the credits came up... Personally, I grew up in Paris, France, I came to the US for graduate studies and I had an environmental protection career for 20 years. So I could strongly identify with Celine, a young woman of French origin with a patina of US graduate schooling and a career in environmental protection work. Her vulnerability shines through her modern chatterbox exterior. The acting is absolutely superb, with the intimate extended conversations drawing us into the characters' lives. Certainly, this movie can stand on its own. For Jesse and Celine, the opportunity to pick up once more their romantic relationship is here! A smart couple would not let the moment pass. I doubt that they would just have a quick passionate affair... I think that the characters already know how lonely their souls can be without true love and commitment and they are emotionally ready to grasp this chance of a lifetime. They have been around long enough to know how rare their type of romantic feeling and connection can be. They will cherish their unique relationship and nurture it forever. My husband and I agreed that the movie could only be watched by couples of ""a certain age"", rather than young couples still searching for life's meaning. Only people who have lived through the throes of searching for a lifelong mate, then living through the disappointments and joys of struggling relationships, can recognize and appreciate what true love is and how important it is to go with one's heart and seize the moment.

13,17 February 2005,senocardeira,10, Pure Delight,"Nine years on Celine and Jessie meet in Paris not entirely by destiny or sheer force of circumstance... Nine years ago I loved Before Sunrise so much! And identified with it even though I was far from home not out of choice - and a war of the kind that bothered Celine in Bosnia was going on in my own country... But I was young. I was 24, actually, very romantic and innocent. Now I Know how things work a little better. The world, relationships. But I'm still plunging into causes for their own sake. And I'm still a reasonably normal person. Just like the characters in this film. Paris has never looked simpler in its casual elegance. Dialogue has never seemed more natural. A script never touched real life like this one so effortlessly. I'm in love with these characters - and with the ending... This is how European Cinema used to be - and Hollywood, too for that matter. Naturally real and magical in the details.",1
14,17 July 2005,claudio_carvalho,9, Delightful Sequel of One of the Most Beautiful Romances I Have Ever Seen,"In Paris, the American writer Jesse Howard (Ethan Hawk) is in the end of an European tour, promoting his novel about the one night stand he had with a young French woman nine years ago. In the end of the debates in a bookstore, he finds Celine (Julie Delpy) in the audience, who works in an environmental organization, and they leave the place to drink coffee and talk to each other before Jesse goes to the airport. Along the moments together, they realize that they are still in love for each other.",2
15,22 June 2013,Arcturus1980,10, Actual intoxicating perfection,"Rarely do I watch Before Sunrise and not Before Sunset immediately afterward. The former insists on the latter. A divine three hours indeed. The original writing team of Richard Linklater and Kim Krizan get the story credit, while Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke join Linklater for the screenplay credit. Way cool to have actors writing their own sublime dialogue. Funding difficulties forced a minimalism congruous with the naturalism. Done in real time with long continuous shots, there is not a hint of contrivance. I really cannot imagine an improvement of any significance on this superlative film.",4
16,5 October 2018,cricketbat,4," I appreciate it, but I don't like it.","I appreciate Before Sunset for what it is -- a sequel made nine years after the original, set nine years after the original, starring the same two actors and following up on the events of the original -- but that does not mean I liked it. The conversations in this film were not as interesting as the first movie, and I did not want the two romantic leads to get together anymore. Yes, it feels very realistic, but who wants to listen to people complain about their life and their marriage for over an hour?",2
17,20 August 2016,SnoopyStyle,8, sweet return,It's 9 years after the events of 'Before Sunrise'. American Jesse Wallace (Ethan Hawke) is in Paris on a book tour after writing about that night with CÃ©line (Julie Delpy) in Vienna. He's coy to the reporters about that night. CÃ©line shows up and they restart the conversation while he waits for his flight later that night. She reveals that she didn't make their planned meeting due to her grandmother's funeral. He reveals that he did return for the meeting. He's married with a son. She has a photojournalist boyfriend who is away. The conversation fluctuates between breezy and deeper material until personal truths start to be spilled.,/
18,7 December 2017,classicsoncall,7," ""Memory is a wonderful thing if you don't have to deal with the past.""","At the conclusion of my review for ""Before Sunrise"", I practically vowed I wouldn't be catching any of the sequels, but IMDb beckons with it's Top #250 list (this one from #2015), so here I am again. I thought there might be a more mature handling of the now adult Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), but it seems like they're still stuck in that awkward teenage stage of their lives. At least that's the case with the dialog that consumes most of the picture.",?

20,1 July 2007,yoescribo88,8, Life as few know it,"I'm a movie lover. That first thing said, i have to recognize that i'm really hard on movies, and i usually discard many of them for being under-prepared, for so many errors and things like that. But with ""Before Sunset"" i felt different. We all know movies are just fakes: what happens, what we see is not the real life. It's just a construction. It's just somebody imagination becoming a visual media. But when i was watching this movie, i didn't felt that. I was seeing real people, with real problems and having thoughts, and fears and hopes. It's the most real acting i ever saw. All about it is just perfect: the ambiance, the set, the city, even the apartment we can see at the near end. Every piece of the movie was connected, and you can tell a whole story about the characters just for hear them, or seeing the way they talk, the things they said, the music they chooses or the things they have. In that way of thinking, i found this movie inspirational, a well-made piece of life, and incredibly deep and wide film. I think this is a portrait of life as only a few can know, of all the shadows and lights we all share.",e

22,30 October 2012,paloma54,1, The longest half hour I've spent in months......,"A truly gag-worthy inside look at the juvenile, self-serving world view which motivates Hollywood writers and producers. Ethan Hawke was physically unappealing (can't he get his teeth fixed?!), his character narcissistic beyond belief. Julie Delpy is so busy trying to be charming as her character tells Jesse about all the wonderfully righteous things she has been doing to save the planet from all the bad actors in the world who are polluting everything, while she and Jesse puff away on their ciggies. Hello? The first few minutes of interviewing Ethan Hawke's character were laughable. I simply couldn't buy the idea that any person this inarticulate could have written a novel considered a worthwhile piece of literature. Jesse (Hawke) sounds like a bumbling 19 year old college sophomore. After 30 minutes of this disgusting drivel, I decided to preserve my stomach and eject the disc.",_
23,8 March 2005,libri,10, A perfect sequel to Before Sunrise,"When I saw Before Sunrise I really enjoyed it. It was the essence of every romantic travel fantasy and, lets face it, Ethan Hawke was the stuff that fantasies are made of. Having enjoyed the first movie so much I was really looking forward to the sequel but was also feeling some trepidation. What if they made a mess of it? Fortunately when I finally got to see the film any concern was put to rest. Before Sunset is everything I wanted in a sequel. The characters had matured in a way that made sense. You could see how the young Jessie and Celine had come to be these thirty-something people. There was no sickly sweet romantic perfection. These characters were clearly the product of real life, effected by their decisions good or bad, making compromises, sometimes insecure, a little scarred, but still holding on to memories and dreams of perfect moments. They are still on a journey but no longer sure that their destination is the right one. Unsure whether they can change direction, or even if they should, but afraid of what will happen if they don't.",=

28,26 May 2006,GOWBTW,10, Enjoyable from the start!,"Ever tried to go back to your first love you met years ago? And later you're involved with someone else, and not very happy? This movie gives the word comfort in a whole new meaning. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke star in the sequel to the movie ""Before Sunrise"". They show the flashbacks of ""Before Sunrise"" and it makes the movie more enjoyable to watch. And Julie Delpy's role of Celine is ""tre magnifique"". She sings, and plays the guitar. This movie can be enjoyed in any language. OOH! LaLa! However, the story has a lot of flashbacks and what the future holds for each. Each one found love after nine years apart, yet neither one is happy. Jesse(Ethan Hawke) is a father, but his marriage to his wife is a total mess, Celine(Julie Delpy) is striking out everywhere in France. Both shared their joys and pains, and they seem to rely on each other when they first met. This movie can be definitely used in French class, and I think it can also used as a learning experience for all. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.",r

30,24 July 2006,dasalinas,10, Beautiful in its simplicity,"I saw both movies, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, at home as DVD's and was amazed at the effect these movies had on me. I was mesmerized and entranced by the utter simplicity and beauty of the love story. The Sunrise movie takes us through a magical night in Vienna where two young (23 year old) adults fall in love. The sequel Sunset movie re-unites them nine years later in Paris. During the nine year interval, much of the idealism they had as young adults has been been overtaken by the realism that comes with life disappointments experienced in the intervening years. The dialog in both movies is so compellingly real and so natural it borders on surreal. Its like being a fly on the wall. It doesn't seem like they're acting at all. The script was written by Director Linklater, and actors Delpy and Hawke. Any guy will fall in love with Celine. Thank you, Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke for creating these two small movie masterpieces. Its a must see for all romantic souls. Best movie I've seen in years. 10 out of 10.",

As such, I delayed seeing this as long as possible.",

The conversations and cinematography is beautiful as expected. This movie makes you feel sad in a way that can otherwise only be felt after a heartbreak or regret over life's decisions.

34,4 February 2011,Scarecrow-88,10, Before Sunset,"I think those of us in our thirties will really respond to BEFORE SUNSET as we did to BEFORE SUNRISE when we were twenty. I think those in my age group will have a special place for these two movies because they fell within our time, as if a voice speaking for us. But, ultimately, the idea of unrequited love is universalâ€”how many of us truly loved this certain someone, that first true love, only to find ourselves married or linked to another, although we will forever remember that girl/boy who got away? My heart both melted and warmed as I revisited BEFORE SUNSET since I first watched it back when I was a little younger in 2005, still in my twenties, but approaching my thirties. However, in 1995, when BEFORE SUNRISE was made, I was so young, a teenager with the future ahead of me(in essence, two years later I'd be married, and the next 12 work in a factory, before losing that job gave way to a possible brighter future)and so the plot of two people, an American young man touring Europe, running into, by chance(or dare I say itâ€”gulpâ€”fate )a lovely Parisian woman, the two sparking conversation, before remaining together throughout the day and night, falling in love in the process. I secretly am a romantic at heartâ€”although that side of me is often hidden awayâ€”and so BEFORE SUNRISE & BEFORE SUNSET have a way of really reaching me, holding me in their grip, and I hate when those movies end. It's nearly improbable, the idea that two people who would never meet in Vienna, find each other in Paris as Ethan Hawke has written his experiences with Julie Delpy in a novella which is a success. They pick up right where they left off, with relationship problems(he is unhappy in his marriage, probably because his wife is not Delpy, and she can not find a substitute for Hawke), discussing intimately details which have accumulated over the last nine years since the last time they saw each other. It starts with small talk and eventually both admit and confront the disappointments of being apart and never recovering from that moment in their lives which forever remains with them. And, Paris is the backdrop, the two walking and chatting, as if one 80 minute long take, quite an impressive feat for director Linklater who allows us to partake in their reunion.",
35,2 February 2013,Metacognizant,1, In one word: trite.,"This film lacked all the charm of the first. In Before Sunrise we have this intriguing & alluring physical attraction and intellectual interest between two characters that ""destiny"" has united on a train. We follow them through an exhilaratingly spontaneous evening as their youthfully curious sensual dynamism develops. Their dialogue is interesting and sincere, and their attraction is sweet and sort of nostalgia-evoking. ",

I'm a huge Julie Delpy fan. I think the idea of having the actors from the original film contribute to the screenplay of the sequel is inspired. Bravo Richard, Bravo! I love that about you. What I didn't love was the result. Basically it didn't go anywhere. Flat beginning, middle and end. No magic. Maybe that is what it was trying to convey, the loss of magic, inability to recapture the magic. But why make a film about that? Why end the story of these two characters on a down note?

Celine (Julie Delpy), his partner from a short-lived romance nine years ago, shows up at a roundtable for his book signing and they pick up almost immediately where they left off. Jesse has eighty minutes before he has to leave to catch his plane and that is how long the movie lasts. They go for coffee and take a walk through Paris. They talk and talk, then talk some more.

Acting by Hawke and Delpy is so artificial, these people couldn't have been lovers in a million years. you can feel 0 chemistry between them and the whole movie you just have a feeling of 2 bad actors pretending they once meant something to each other, with an attempt to cover it with a series of really, really boring stories and ""oh were having so much fun together laughing to our silly jokes"" type of talk.",
49,10 July 2020,ArmandoManuelPereira,8, Hugely Satisfying Sequel.,"A hugely satisfying sequel to Before Sunrise. I do not wish to say that it is better then the first film, as both are good. Yet, I personally feel that Sunset has an emotional rawness that goes deep at times and so is maybe the maturer work. Or maybe its just that the characters have matured. In any case it is an enjoyable watch. It rakes a little time to find its main groove, but when it does, you feel that you are entering into a place where hearts are vulnerable and exposed. All that and an enigmatic, but perfect ending.",

55,1 June 2008,clemtine,10, What if?,"Unfolding almost in real-time, this is a story about another chance for love that was once lost. Set nine years after they first met, Jesse and Celine find themselves older and wiser and still crazy about each other. They meet in a bookstore where Jesse is on tour for his best-selling novel which, incidentally, is a transcript of their magical night in Vienna long ago. He needs to leave for the airport soon and they have just about an hour to spend with each other in Paris. This film is going down in movie history for me as one in my all-time top ten favorite romantic films. It is even better than its 1995 prequel, which was already magnificent in itself. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have unbelievable chemistry. Their two characters are even more real than when they were first introduced all those years ago. Their love for each other just bounces off the screen. This is terribly remarkable film-making. The immediate sequences are a direct metaphor to the urgency of their situation, how little time they have. It is beautiful. I can't even spot the longest shot. It must have taken a real effort for those two actors to pull off these great performances, long dialogues and all. The best part about this film is that it can be seen as a stand-alone. You don't have to have already seen Before Sunrise. Watch it and I swear you won't regret it.",

Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, and Richard Linklater have created two extraordinary people with ordinary lives, but their ability to articulate their thoughts and emotions to each other puts them way above any movie couple I have ever seen.  10 years after they parted ways, Jesse (Hawke)and Celine (Delpy) feel each other out and then lay it all on the line after hearing one another's story.  This sequel surpasses the original, as Jesse and Celine have grown up, and now they have grown-up problems to boot, but their connection hasn't gone anywhere.  The open ending was perfect as well.

The movie reminded me of meeting a long-lost friend after a long time and how you catch up. Though the movie speaks of lovers it can be applied to any relationship. The flow of the movie was of calm river undisturbed by external things. I felt a sense of relaxation while I watched the movie.

So I assume most people were surprised that Before Sunrise, a small romance that only made about $5.5 million would warrant a sequel. But it did. I haven't seen the first one, which was released in 1995, but that didn't stop me from seeing its sequel, Before Sunset. I have learned that you usually don't need to see the first movie in series to understand it. Some enjoyment may fall out of it, but it's still coherent nonetheless. Before Sunset is a sequel where you don't need to see the first. In fact, I think I probably benifited from not seeing the first.",

62,7 October 2012,jboothmillard,6, Before Sunset,"I am pretty sure that I heard the title of this sequel before the title of the original, Sunrise, so having watched the fantastic original I was very interested to see how the follow up would fare, from writer / director Richard Linklater (Waking Life, School of Rock, A Scanner Darkly, Me and Orson Welles). Basically it has been nine years since Jesse (Ethan Hawke), now a writer from the United States, and CÃ©line (Julie Delpy), now an environmental protection organisation worker, met on the train from Budapest to Vienna and spent a day, and a night, together. They ""coincidentally"" reconnect when Jesse is in France, Paris to promote his novel ""This Time"", inspired by his time with CÃ©line, as he talks about the book, and a new one he is planning he has flashbacks about her, then he spots her outside smiling. The bookstore manager reminds him he will be catching a plane back to America within an hour or so, so when they decide to spend some time together just wandering the city their time together is again constrained. As before they talk about themselves, but mostly what has happened since they last met and what they have learned and changes in their circumstances, for example Jesse is married with a little boy, and CÃ©line has a boyfriend, and obviously as they find all this out there are many personal questions and explanations. Jesse admits that he did show up in Vienna at the spot where they said they would meet again in six months, but CÃ©line explains that she could not come because her grandmother died and the funeral happened to be that day, and they did not exchange addresses or phone numbers, so the chances of them meeting again were slim. As they talk and continue to stroll around Paris they express opinions of how life in general has changed, i.e. in the world, but mostly they clearly show dissatisfaction of the lives they have now, Jesse is only staying married for the sake of his son, and CÃ©line hardly sees her boyfriend at all because he is always on assignment, and they talk about the fact that they had sex together, twice. They go through various venues, a coffee shop, a garden, a park, an open excursion boat, and in a hire car, their feelings for each other are slowly rekindled, but at the same time there is small frustration that they could not get together those nine years ago. Jesse admits that he was desperate to see CÃ©line again so much that he wrote the book in the hope of her reading it and finding her, and she admits that she did read it, twice, and it brought back emotional memories of their time together. The concluding scene sees them go quickly into her apartment where CÃ©line promised to play him a song on her guitar that she wrote herself, she plays him her waltz song (written by Delpy) which contains lyrics that clearly relate to their time together, and Jesse then puts on a Nina Simone CD that she dances to and imitates Simone's voice and attitude, and the last moment sees her say ""Baby... you are gonna miss that plane."", and he just smiles and says ""I know"", and the film ends. Once again Hawke and Delpy have great chemistry together, obviously being in their thirties their characteristics have changed slightly, but you can tell that the characters long to possibly show stronger affection than they may be expressing. The script is still witty enough, and the real time concept this time makes the film flow in a different style that is interesting, I will admit the fact that they already know each other makes their conversation not as much fun, but it certainly engages you enough to see what will happen next, whether they will reconnect, so overall a likable romantic drama sequel. Good!",
63,10 March 2005,erialc,10, Perfection,"Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy were just sublime in ""Before Sunset"", the sequel to their 1994's ""Before Sunrise"". Essentially, it's a movie about nothing -- the two of them see each other for the first time after nine years and just walk and talk; yet, at the same time, it's about everything and anything we truly care, desire, and hope for in life. It's about love, our perception of it, our yearning to attain it, and our disappointments for our inability to put a grasp on it. Nine years later, we see clearly the signs of dissatisfaction and disappointments on their faces. Frustrated with the banality of life, yet imprisoned by the vast responsibilities to themselves and the ones they love to endure its miseries, the two of them are no longer as hopeful, nor as romantic about life and love, like they were nine years ago. There is less dreaming this time, more about reality, more about the pains experienced and the compromises made in life. There are also regrets, regrets about this lost love, and tears, tears held back in their eyes wondering what could've been. But the sparks and longings they saw and felt long ago were still palpable, just like they were the night they first met. By the end of the film, it's clear that not all is lost, their love is buried some where deep down in their hearts, cherished by their memories of that one encounter almost a decade ago. And for us, it's always comforting to know that perhaps, just perhaps, their love could eventually prevail, for after all, we are all hopeless romantics struggling to live a life of love and dream.",

Unfortunately, it has now claimed the lives of many viewers who too spineless to say they hated it because expressing an honest opinion might cause them to be scorned by those who feel that this movie is a work of art. This movie was no ""Dinner with Andre"" nor was it in the league of other great script intensive movies. This was simply a bad movie. The characters were self-absorbed and terribly uninteresting. The script was stuffed with cookie-cutter philosophical quotes and paraphrases and I wanted to vomit after hearing each utterance. The city of Paris could have been used a distinct character in this movie, in the way that Tokyo was used in ""Lost in Translation"".

These two young people who had met 6 years earlier in a ""passonate"" fleeting moment (The subject of an earlier film)seemed intent on destroying any pleasant memories that they had each carried of the other! This was the longest stupidest movie I believe I have ever watched! The use of brief ""flash-backs"" from the movie filmed in 1995 was unique and interesting because the characters had changed (matured in appearance) but not unrecognizably so. The Movie set was very nice (maybe it was really Paris?). But the streets of Paris and the ""flash-back"" technique could be put to much better use elsewhere! The Movie contained a lot of unnecessarily nasty language - maybe in an attempt to make the conversation provocative? Don't waste you time watching this movie!",

75,14 March 2015,StevePulaski,10," Man, it's great to be alive","Initially, I had planned to watch Richard Linklater's Before trilogy in three days, watching one film after another. However, upon viewing Before Sunrise, along with writing the review, I took note that this trilogy was about time, time progression, and how people respond with being in company with one another for either an extended period of time or, in contrast, a relatively short period of time sporadically. I thought in order to make the trilogy bear a wee bit more relevance and realism for me, as a viewer, seeing as impatiently waiting nine years between each film to see them in theaters was an option I missed, I'd distance each film by about two weeks (and with the amount of films I watch in between, there would hopefully be little obsessing over what happens to the characters in between that time). My confession to you, the reader, is that it took all of my strength not to watch Before Sunset sooner than I had scheduled it; Before Sunrise is the kind of film that blindsides you so greatly, and tickles your human spirit so tenderly, that when it's over, knowing there's more films of the like makes you want to seek those others out immediately. Unfortunately, I had to exercise some restraint in the process to at least add some personal realism to this series; like I was impatiently waiting with these characters to see one another again.",

77,15 September 2020,moirasofiavaccaro,6, Forced and cheesy,"I loved the first part ""Before Sunrise"", but I felt it was ruined with this sequel. I rated 6 stars because Paris shots are always good to watch, and the actors' performance is really good. But regarding the story, I was very disappointed.
I found the movie in general so cheesy it's almost unrealistic. On one hand, some of the characther's reflexions are interesting as in the first movie, maybe because it shows some part of them that it had been left out in the previous film or because they show how their personalities have changed in some aspects as they got older.
However, on the other hand, I feel like there are some details that come across as ""forced"". I think that ""Before Sunrise"" left us with a very nice feeling at the end, like full of this kind of ""teenage love"" and also rather sad because of their split, but with an uncertainty and a question up for debate in the audience (will they be seeing each other again in 6 months?) Finally, ""Before Sunset"" crushes all that with a new meeting after 9 years. Both characters are unhappy about how their love lives turned out be, which could be realistic, but what doesn't fit me is that they seem to be blaming the encounteer that they had when they were younger, pointing it as the reason for why they didn't develop themselves in a better way. They left EVERYTHING they were on this night, and then they wrote books about it, they wrote songs about it, like everything in their lives revolved around this one day, and I don't know, it sounds a little bit forced to me and I feel like it poors the construction of both caracthers.
Anyway, I can't say the movie is bad. It just wasn't what I expected for the continuation of the story: I get some of the main messages intended to be put on the table, but from the very first minutes of the film, I found it unconfortable and not in the good way.

It is not that it is far-fetched and unrealistic, on the contrary, it is very realistic and many a viewer will immediately recognise the way the two protagonists, who may have lost sight of, but had not forgotten, one another, interact. From the tentative exploration of the emotional landscape in the Parisian cafÃ© at the beginning of the film, to the more intimate open closing scene with its mixture of sexual tension and regret over missed opportunities and choices wrongly made, the script, filmed in apparent real time, stays very close to life. However, like some nineteenth-century realistic novels of which this film reminded me a little (e.g. George Gissing's New Grub Street), realism does not necessarily make for compelling viewing. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the film, not even in the acting, that lifts the everyday story to a higher plane so as to invest it with more meaning.

""Before Sunrise"" tells the story of Jessie & Celine's one-day romance in Vienna. Jessie is the American and Celine is the Frenchie. They were young, vulnerable, and adventurous. The film's open-ended finale left us pondering if they would reunite in 6 months. Before you know it, 9 years have passed. So you know what that means, Sequel Heaven! Jessie & Celine are now Sunset People! Doing it right! Night after night! OK, Summer's over! Donna Summer, that is. ""Before Sunset"" is one of the best sequels ever! I know some of you think that my brain is fried by getting too much sun with this overstatement. However, you have to experience this breathtaking sunset to believe it. In ""Sunset"", Jessie & Celine unexpectedly reunite in Paris nine years later. They're older, wiser, and more experienced in the game of love. Will they recapture the magic in this ""Sunset Place""? If you are an avid fan of ""Sunrise"", then you will adore the ""Sunset"" even more. The film's poetic masterful screenplay is quite deserving of its Academy Award nomination; which by the way was scribed by Linklater, Jessie, and Celine. Yes! Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Their acting was also not too shabby. Ethan Hawke as Jessie and Julie Delpy as Celine were commanding thespian performances that were definitely on the sunny-side up category. Without a doubt, the best acting duet of the year! Reunited and it felt so good to see Hawke and Delpy on screen together again. I announce in my delpysition that Delpy's work might very well be the best female acting of 2004. So much so, that I desperately wish I had ""Jessie's Girl"".

This is because Celine's grandmother died, leaving Ethan alone in Vienna. They meet each other in Paris after Jesse is in a book signing session with his book that adapts from his experience in Venice. They decide to talk about what happened to their lives and how they are. Jesse is married and an author, while Celine has a boyfriend and is an environmental activist.

They were strangers and there was nothing tricky or hidden to be surveyed, and their emotional baggage was light; it was a straightforward meet cute. Initially it seems to be again one of those chance encounters that happens only in movies. We are under the impression that Jesse is over the moon to once again see Celine, and that she also wants the chance to make up for not being there at the train station.

Sometimes little gems turn up - Cinema Paradiso, The Thin Man, Clerks - and occasionally I'm left cold.I'm afraid this film was in the second variety. Before I watched it I read only good reviews - how does IMDb classify them? So I thought it would be worth dropping a few slightly more alternative thoughts on a film I so wanted to enjoy. 1. The main characters are soooo boring, honestly I cannot imagine spending any more than 10 minutes with them in real life. Gauche and self obsessed; not my cup of tea and definitely not people to care about. 2. The script is weak as water. It honestly sounds like they were making it up as they went along - badly. It was like watching Big Brother - boring people saying boring things. 3. There's no atmosphere to the film, no colour, no spark. I mean nothing - no characters, no character. It's great to see Hollywood drag itself out of its natural home - the west coast, and even better to attempt a film like this, but it never really works. Setting a film in Paris and employing a French actress doesn't make it worth watching, I would suggest trying one of the other 499.",

110,17 December 2013,harsh-kabeer1,9, Love is all you need.,"Before Sunrise was a date movie- a boy and a girl meets and talks about love, life, their experiences and their interpretations. They talk and talk. Both wary of love, but still falling for each other. It had those smart great dialogues that make for an absorbing patient watch. In their conversations I found my own philosophy, my own search for soulmate and my own dilemmas. But there was something amiss there. A proper narratively structured story was missing, yes, but what the movie was really deficient was in its aloofness. It muses about ideas of love and life and they even lay bare their personal lives to each other, but what was missing was the translation of that anguish, of that hurt, of that disappointment in the wordings of their dialogues and mannerisms. It is like they are trying to reach a diagnosis in that clinical detached sort of way and this may be an appropriate treatment given the circumstances of the movie, but that was very off putting for me. Now coming to Before Sunset, it is everything that its predecessor was and much more. It takes place nine years after their first encounter with each other. He is the author of a best selling novel on a book tour in Paris. She stays in Paris and works for a cause. They meet in the morning and he has a flight to catch in the evening. So starts their second date. It starts initially with their cool detachment to the growing love between them, more so as they are left bitter by their love lives though their professional lives are in a much better state, but you could see in their mannerisms and dialogues their anguish and their pain and their longing for each other. A look here and there. A word here and there. You could feel that. And then in the second half where this facade of coolness bursts open and they for the first time really talk their heart out, you really get to know them and feel them and care for them. These are two vulnerable people charred with their bitter and disappointing experiences in the matters of heart trying to come in terms with loneliness and their elusive search for 'the one' and their anger and frustration to keep up their appointment. The screenplay credit is shared by Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke along with Richard Linklater. And since both Delpy and Hawke were going through tumultuous relationships, you could read their notes of sufferings and pain in the dialogues they deliver. That added to the movie that sort of realism that was missing in the predecessor. SPOILERS AHEAD. There are two things that I am dying to mention here. First is the look that Julie Delpy gives now and then and more frequently in the second half to Ethan Hawke when he is not conscious of them. That look is the most painful and beautiful thing ever. That look says it all. And the second is the ending. The ending is just wow. WOW!! He is there sitting on the sofa looking at her and smiling. She is right there in front of him but not facing him and dancing slowly to a beautiful song. He knows there is a flight to catch. She reminds him of that playfully. But he is still smiling and she is still dancing. What an ending. Wow. SPOILERS OVER. Before Sunset is a movie that is for everybody who has fallen in love, is about to or has always wondered about it. It speaks to the heart, expresses the dilemma, but does not answer the question. It is funny and sad how the protagonists are trying to be real in their expectations, but are actually craving that idealism. Don't we all want that perfect soulmate that we hear it in all the fairy tale ending stories? So who am I to blame them?! Keep hoping, Jesse and Celine. And that was what the ending was about-an instillation of optimism in our hearts for that fairy tale ending.",

In a movie phenomenon, the amount of real time that passed between the films being released and the amount of time that passes in the lives of the characters between the films is the same. This time Jesse and Celine meet up in Paris. It's been ten years since the last film and ten years since they've seen each other. They are both with other people, Jesse is married with a child. He's now a published author and Celine finds him at a stop in Paris. They spend an afternoon together and their old chemistry is undeniable. This installment is even more closely tied just to the two main characters. There are no guys on a bridge or wandering gypsies this time.

Terrible, soap opera over dramatized acting, way too many unnecessary sexual references, and none of the sweetness of the first film.

I've followed Ethan's acting career with enthusiasm and scrutiny, but I must say, taking this role did not suit him. The pace of it all was way too slow even for mediocre minds. This was worse than ""August"" or ""Junebug."" (see all my reviews; they are not all negative)! The guitar music was sappy along with the odd conversation between ONE man and ONE woman. Where is everyone else? Not many actors can pull off an entire film without support cast members. This was one step up from ""Castaway"" at least... (well Tom did have his coconut head), but lacks the variety of emotions needed for a class ""A"" film. I'm sorry, but this movie was just too under-acted and no one falls in love that fast at their (understood to be) characters' ages and implied intelligence level. Maybe teenagers fall in love that quickly, but real love takes time. If you're looking to pass the time with absolutely nothing else to do, or if you need a good sleeping aide, then by all means, watch this film!",

It's what Jesse says at some point - nobody really ever change. Being of the same age group of the characters, I could identify a lot with what they say and feel. Which means that Hawke and Delpy did a great job, both acting and writing this film. It's subtle, delicate, and it needs to be listened to very attentively, not to miss one word of the great, deep dialogue. Well done to all of them.

The original movie could have easily done without the sequel, just as many films not based on comic book characters could. With that idea in mind, this film could have also brought the story of Jesse and Celine to a happy ending that felt like a cop out, which I expected it to do. However, director and writer Richard Linklater manages to bring these characters into full circle in ""Before Sunset"" without giving the romantic comedy fans what they want, which is why ""Before Sunset"" is just as good as its predecessor.",

The acting was very natural. Choices were made by the demand of the previous moment rather than for the mere Eggo. Both actors were very much into what they were doing.

They walk, they talk, they sit, they talk, they have sex, they talk. And throughout the evening, they realize that they are probably meant to be together forever. She has to leave, but they tell each other that they will meet in Vienna in six months. ""Before Sunset"" picks up 9 years later, and Jesse is on the last leg of a European book tour, in France. The book is based on his experiences that night, so it of course shocks and awes him when he looks over at the patrons of the bookstore and sees Celine.

The actors and director got together because they wanted to continue with the story and there was more of a story to tell. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy show great dramatic range. Lest we forget that they also helped write the movie and that too provides another level to enjoy the film on. It doesn't drift into conventions, it makes its own rules. This film is what romantic movies should always be: true to life. It doesn't shy away from the fact that these two may not get together, it doesn't provide a simple answer. It asks the audience to take the journey with them. The last 20 minutes of this movie is some of the most honest, heartfelt, and emotionally draining moments I have seen in film.

How could he (Director Linklater) do this, to tantalize and torment in such a rueful, and a cruel way!? Don't watch this movie without watching the prequel (""Before Sunrise""), first; you will be playing an oft confusing game of catch-up, I believe, if you do (i.e., watch these movies out of chronological order). I watched this movie three times before returning it. It is a gem of a movie, and the actors and writers should consider a third installment when the time is right ... not in any prerequisite number of years (i.e., nine for example). Here is my unsolicited vote for J. Delpy for an Academy Award for Best Actress 2004 for her work in ""Before Sunset""! Her performance throughout was captivating, engaging, engrossing. Her display of anger while riding in the van was such that only a Frenchwoman can manifest and it was mesmerizing!!!

I found this movie fairly disappointing given its high ratings: The first two-thirds of the movie truly moves at a french glacial pace and the dialog just goes on and on...what's the purpose? Avoidance? Lite repartee a long nine years after their intense tryst? The build up happens far too slowly to sustain interest; it isn't until the limo ride to the airport (via her apartment) that the emotionally significant part of the movie finally kicks in...and when it does, it's very good. Despite the pacing problems, all the dialog is well written and delivered naturally as though the actors had written the lines themselves (which, as you know, they did). This movie would have been much better had they jumped from the book signing (which also dragged on for too long) to the cafe and then to its ultimate conclusion.

141,3 July 2004,inman50,10," A Magical, Elegiac Continuation Of ""Before Sunrise""","Notice that I said ""continuation"", as opposed to ""sequel"", which is mostly a Hollywood term applied to cashing in on the success of an original film. There is nothing ""commercial"" about Richard Linklater's inventive, playful, wistful, and ultimately piercing story of two people many of us felt a deep cinematic bond with in the first film. For everyone who was content and beguiled by the aching ambiguity of the ending of ""Before Sunrise"", who felt no need to explore what became of Jesse and Celine, I think it's safe to say that our hearts still yearned to see them together. What ""Before Sunset"" does so beautifully is to show the effect of time on these two soul mates, how young love and youthful idealism have given way to life's weary compromises and bittersweet memories of what might have been. The torrent of glorious dialogue is back, only this time it's as remarkable for what is not said as much as what should be said. Jesse and Celine circle around each other with small talk, a rudimentary update of their lives in the intervening 9 years that slowly, irrevocably, and anxiously builds up to confessional regret. To see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy again 9 years later is like running into two dear old friends we haven't seen in a long time. Their rapport and chemistry together is extraordinary. To those who feared this film would somehow diminish the specialness of the original, it feels like an unequivocal homecoming. And the true miracle is it leaves you wanting more. Something tells me that many of us will never get enough of Jesse and Celine, and in that creative spirit, I'm sure Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy have Truffaut's ""Antoine Doinel"" films with Jean-Pierre Leaud, and Michael Apted's ""7-up"" series well in mind. For the time being, we have this wondrous little film to be thankful for.",

Even though in my opinion its the weakest of the trilogy, This is not a bad film at all. Everything about the film works. The one thing that doesn't make it a 10/10 is that it is to much like the first in the begging. But by the end of the film, it changes and has the best ending in the trilogy. There isn't to much I can say about it because its already been said. The acting is fantastic as well as the writing. The directing has a low budget feel. And I love the scenery.

The conversations they have are interesting and character-revealing, and you wish you could join in. Some of the transitions between topics are clumsy--I heard that the director and actors improvised the script, so I guess they weren't able to connect some of the ideas they had on different days.

I feel though, it falls second to Before Sunset. The difference between the two and what makes Before Sunset superior is the vehicle that drives the film. In Sideways, it is comedy. In Before Sunset, it is emotion-heartbreak, arrogance, hopelessness, and love. These by innate nature make it more powerful and haunting than the escapades of Payne's great film. Linklater, a great director that makes a Texan proud to be Texan again, directs like a great conductor letting a world-famous soloist take the vehicle where it needs to go but just keeping the headlights on. These two performances are deeply earnest. You can see the heartbreak coming from their own lives inch out of their mouths and glow from the building tears in their eyes. Whether or not they are bringing experiences from their own life is irrelevant. They are channeling what they know these characters need to feel into the sublime script. I hope and feel this will be remembered along with Sideways, Colllateral, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Closer as redeeming qualities making 2004 a movie year worth remembering.",

Haunting, Entrancing, every bit as wonderful as its already cult status (only one year old now) indicates. Ethan Hawke, gaunt, hunched and withered, and Julie Delpy, wiser and better, accidentally (or did fate set it up?) meet up a decade after their previous single day together to spend another day reliving it, and catching up with a decade that they eventually realize was all about that one day. What a love story this is! No love-making, but intelligent conversation that is orgasmic, covering the environment, Buddhism, the modern self, psychotherapy, relationships, America and Americans, sex and gender, God Â– pretty much everything that young people care about in ones and share about in twos. This is an even better film than the first one, sharper and tighter, and benefiting from the ground laid down by it, so that we now care so much more deeply for this couple that were essentially strangers to us the first time around. America meets Europe again here, as the couple walk around talking over Parisian backdrops that are not at all hard to look at. This is a must see, but only after you've seen Before Sunrise.

This time, I felt the city was less of a feature, and it also feels more urgent snd purposeful as you know how the characters feel about each other already. It is charming, with phenomenally realistic performances.

Knowing that there were two sequels, I was even more intrigued. Well, in 2004 Before Sunset was released. The film was written, directed, and produced by Richard Linklater (Before Sunrise, School of Rock, and Waking Life) and stars Ethan Hawke (Before Sunrise, Waking Life, and Assault on Precinct 13) and Julie Delpy (Before Sunrise, Waking Life, and Three Colors: White). The film was a financial success and also a critical success as well.",
153,26 September 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6, The space between words.,"As with its predecessor, 'Before Sunset (2004)' is at its most successful when it focuses on the relationship between its two core characters, this time painting it as a painfully accurate reunion. This focus on 'what could've been' and 'what may be yet to come' is where the piece really shines, crafting a palpable dynamic between its two long-lost lovers and giving the story a strange sense of suspense. Of course, a seventy-five-minute conversation is going to meander. This is especially noticeable when the topics of conversation turn to philosophising, with changes in direction sometimes being as drastic as going straight from ""how are you?"" to ""do you believe in god?"". When this is the case, the dialogue reflects the writers far more than the characters - I mean, you can practically hear Linklater saying some of this stuff - and the experience is worse for it. Still, it's all remarkably compelling for what it is. Despite being slightly theatrical, it feels incredibly 'real' as compared to others in the genre. There are no grand gestures or arbitrary break-ups, there's just an excellently evolving relationship. It's also great how the space in-between words is sometimes as important as the words themselves, indicative of subtle writing that really knows what it's doing. Overall, it's about as good as it's predecessor. As an experiment, it works rather well. It's not always the most engaging affair but it often makes you smile and it has a decent pace considering it's a constant 'talk-fest'. The core relationship is what really keeps you watching and it really is one of the best in its genre. 6/10",

158,22 December 2011,KineticSeoul,8, Just two characters constantly talking...And it's great.,"What this movie basically is, is a conversation between two character, one guy and a woman talking about life in general, there dreams, society and what they faced etc...But the movie is very interesting and is just entertaining to watch two character just ramble on. The movie is believable and realistic to the point you can't help but buy into it. Although few times I felt it was actors and actresses on screen but most of the way through it felt like real people not characters having real conversations with each other. And that is one of the elements that drives this movie besides the topic of the conversations which is another key element that made this movie good. What other thing that impressed me is the long one take scenes during the conversations since if they screwed up they would have to start that whole long take over again. Sometimes it seems like it compacted a bunch of interesting thoughts about certain stuff into one movie as much as possible but for the most part it's alright. And it also didn't seem all that forced and seemed natural most of the way through to the point it felt like a improv or they winged it. Some of the stuff the characters cover some audiences might agree with and some might not, but it's still interesting conversations that you won't mind listening to. Like how sometimes you might eavesdrop into other people's conversation and be interested in it, this movie is the epitome of that. The chemistry between the two characters was also really good. The ""what if"" aspect to this movie is also very well integrated into this movie. Even if this movie is about two people having conversations you will probably appreciate this movie even more the second time you watch it.",

164,13 July 2004,edelwais,9, why it doesn't matter how it ends,"It is interesting that most of the critics like this one better than Before Sunrise because the characters are ""more mature"". My take on this is: most of the critics are closer and above this age range (early 30s) and it is simply more difficult for them to relate to the first movie. However, these two movies are even more worthwhile considered together especially from the point of view of the audience that were 20 when the first one came out and are almost 30 now. Back in 95 Before Sunrise resonated with me because it was very relevant to the way I and my friends looked at the world, we had similar dreams, concerns, it was the way we talked. And of course we imagined meeting this one soul-mate with whom you understand each other without having to finish sentences, and you have exactly the same doubts and look forward your life ahead and are reluctant to commit right then because who know what else may come your way. Today Before sunset has exactly the same effect, I am almost 30 and I have changed just like the characters and I have similar problems and again this the way I would talk and the themes I would discuss in a conversation. I am sure this is roughly true for this whole generation. I don't think the open ending is intended for us to guess what happened in either of the two movies, although Jesse says in the beginning of Sunset: well it depends, if you are an optimist they meet in 6 months and if not.... I think the open ending in both movies emphasizes the fact that it does not matter whether they end up together or not. The point is that they are both enriched by meeting and spending a few hours together and by having a good conversation. Sometimes we choose not to be with someone that we feel is our soul-mate, simply because it would cost too much (kids, other people getting hurt) and that is fine, we still have experienced this connection and we will treasure it for the rest of our lives. It is not about letting your true love slip away, we don't know for sure if this is true love, what we know is that we made a connection. I find the brief episode when Jesse tells the journalists the topic of his next book very descriptive of what the movie(s) is all about. This connection that makes our lives richer and better may happen in a night, or in a few hours or in a few moments.",

From the conversation we learn their current situation and they referred to an event from the last film.

The acting, too, I caught myself halfway through the movie becoming seriously attracted to Julie Delpy's characterÂ—I think I love herÂ—an example of the acutely tuned acting in the movie is the scene in which they approach the bench and then sit on it for a while, the gestures that express a desire to touch checked by hesitation, held backÂ—as he is physically holding back, she is doing so emotionally, contriving a casual attitude towards their night spent together 9 years earlier, towards the hopes and fears which have grown inside her since that night and which for her are connected with that night and with him. And their conversation is just full of compelling thoughts and ideas; it raises to the surface large and latent feelingsÂ—I am not referring to their desires to solve world issues, but rather to the more personal thoughts that come out suddenly and wake some sleeping impression in meÂ—they spend long stretches in moderately stimulating discussion, and then, he or she will say something that they've been thinking about all along, this constitutes the ebb and flow of the film's energy, it's what makes it dynamicÂ—if the world was ending tomorrow and I knew it, ""I probably wouldn't want to talk about the environment, or my bookÂ…I'd still want to talk about magic in the universeÂ…only I'd want to do it in a bed in between intense love making sessions with you.""",
206,11 December 2019,vjnambu,7, An underwhelming reunion,"9 years after the events of before sunrise, Celine meets Jesse at his book launch in France. In the end of before sunrise they promised that they will meet in Vienna again after 6 months. But Celine doesn't show up because of her grandma's demise. So after they meet we find out that Jesse is married with a son and Celine is dating a photo journalist. They then travel around France sharing their past experiences until Jesse has to catch his return flight in evening.
I loved before sunrise as I feel its a best love story I have ever seen. In sunrise they spent a whole day together and part ways the next day. So as a audience we also feel like we have spent a memorable day with them. But in sunset we get a feeling of an unsatisfied one day picnic we have on Sundays because they spend very less time together. Another drawback I felt was with its abrupt ending without any proper conclusion. And last thing I felt disappointed was that Jesse and Celine don't have the same chemistry which they had in sunrise. But there are some great scenes. My favorite scene was in the cab where Celine shows her frustration of not being in a committed relationship and in return Jesse talks about his failing marriage and both wanting but unable to touch each other. On the whole, before sunset falls on those category of sequels which only partially captures the magic of its predecessor.",

208,30 September 2006,ChicaDificil,10, Romantic film that leaves you pensive and nostalgic,"I found this movie to be absolutely delightful. I remember seeing its predecessor, Before Sunrise, about nine years ago when it came out on video and being pleasantly surprised by that little gem of a movie. I was slightly younger than the main characters, Jessie and Celine, but their dreams and the questions they were struggling with at the time resonated very much with my own. When I heard that Before Sunset was being released, I was somewhat hesitant about seeing it, fearing that the follow-up would not measure up to its predecessor or that I would find the characters' conversations to be annoying and sophomoric. But Before Sunset turned out to be even better than Before Sunrise. Though just as idealistic and romantic, there is a stronger current of nostalgia in this follow-up. Celine and Jessie are more aware of their own limitations and of the sacrifices they had to make for their chosen paths in life. They are giddy to be around each other but also fearful about confronting the unrealized possibilities of the relationship they have so deeply idealized. Yes, the movie is very much conversation-driven, and the conversations sometimes veer into the realm of pretentiousnessÂ—but then again, who hasn't come off as slightly pretentious when they are trying to impress someone they really like? I felt a strong compassion for these characters who are smart, idealistic, but flawed in ways that are endearing and human. There is a real urgency in their interactions as they try to make up for lost time. Richard Linklater is a talented director who has genuine interest in and empathy for people who are adjusting to the difficulties and demands of adulthood.",

211,19 April 2005,cheryl-77,4, Can I have my 80 minutes back?,"This was actually a very interesting movie. The whole thing takes place in real time during a stroll, cup of coffee, short boat ride and short car ride through Paris. The couple does not stop talking once. Basically they are describing things that another director with a larger budget might have chosen to dramatize. Not that I don't like witty repertoire, but this was ridiculous. I mean it's clever enough, it is exactly the kind of conversation you might have if catching up with a one-night stand after 9 years. Though of course the ""man"" (Hawke) keeps somehow maneuvering the conversation back to jokes about getting the ""woman"" (Delpy) into the sack, which I found to be so juvenile. They skirt around touchy subjects like politics and religion and just when you think the conversation is going to turn into a debate they laugh and all is well (oh aren't they so cute). But I guess in real life that is what you would do with an acquaintance. The whole time we were watching we wondered what was going to happen. Something was going to happen. Nothing really does that isn't obvious. That's why I call this review a spoiler -- there is really nothing to spoil because nothing happens (and I don't mean nothing like Seinfeld's nothing which is really something, I mean NOTHING, just pleasant conversation). Don't get me wrong: the dialogue is very good. Ethan Hawke tends to pick very poetic touching movies. And any other night this would have made a good coffeehouse flick, but we were hoping for something with a little more meat. It was this or ""Defending Your Life"" and I really regret the decision we made! :) Best part of the movie: when Delpy sings the pretty waltz toward the end. Just lovely.",

But watching Before Sunset eventually left me slightly underwhelmed, I have to say. It is not bad at all, neatly tying up the loose ends after the heart-rending ending of the first movie - what happened to obvious soul mates Celine and Jesse? Did they meet up six months later? Did they end up together? Before Sunset is set 10 years after the first film and we get the answers to those questions in a satisfactory manner, but without ever really touching the heights of the first film.

226,24 March 2005,SmartRavi,4, Disappointing.,"Before Sunset is an oddity, a sequel to the one-night-in-Vienna romance of 1994's Before Sunrise. This time the pair reunites 10 yrs later in Paris and 98% of the movie's length is one unbroken conversation between the two. Sadly Julie Delpy ain't quite as beautiful while it seems Ethan Hawke has caught a nasty case of the Hivees. She's an environmental activist and still single he's married and is oh merely a best-selling novelist on a publicity tour promoting his book based on the one night these two spent together in the first flick. So it all gets very self-reflexive real quick, and annoying and not hot. She says that she's romantically numb and he describes his married life as running a nursery with a woman he used to date and has had sex < 10 times in 4 years. They don't kiss or make any promise to meet again and it's all ambiguous and noncommittal and forgettable. The screenplay was co-written by the two stars and a lot of the dialogue is humorless and chilly. I'm pretty annoyed by the whole thing and I think I've loved every other movie directed by my man Linklater, from School of Rock to Dazed & Confused to Waking Life to Slacker.

The protagonists share their experiences of the past 9 years, thoughts about the world and themselves. It's fantastic, and as i said, each subject talked about is richly detailed and interesting. There is apparently no cuts, every event is told in it's fully form. In fact, it is a real-time film, if that exists. And again, it's noteworthy saying: It's all about details.

Both delight in their own way. The ""Before"" series alongside Linklater's other ambitious bore, Boyhood are experiments that ultimately fall short of lofty targets.

The turn of the century definitely made it's impact on our two heroes, as did the turns of time. Now being 32 years old (as opposed to 23, the character's age in the first film), they are both much more mature and much less naive about what life has to offer them. Sure, on the outside they both made it well: Jesse is married with a child he thinks the world of, and is just visiting France during a PR tour for his recent published best seller (loosely based on his night with Celine, by the way). Celine, on the other hand, is engaged in a meaningful relationship as well, and after living several years in the states, where she finished her second degree, she is now an active member in several environmental organizations. Alas, underneath the surface, they are both aching inside. Neither of them is happy with the life he or she is leading, and they both find themselves compromising in cozy relationships and careers, with the memory of that mid-90's night still very much alive in their hearts and minds.",

They meet after 10 years in a Paris library in this movie. Some profane lines in between, as the movie is wholly a conversation between two opposite sex adults. I felt there wasn't much of back-ground music in this. Still there are number of songs which are nice. The movie too gets boring after a while, still happy it is just for 80 minutes.

It's not perfect; nine years is a long, long time to maintain an attraction, however deep, that only had one night to develop. But, I'm willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of watching these two characters reveal themselves with such subtlety and grace. The ending was absolutely perfect for the tone of the film -- if it had ended in the expected way, I would have liked the film far less.

The two protagonists are more complex. They have both suffered disappointments, yet - as Celine observes - their personalities are essentially unchanged, just more finely carved. The film's ending is inspired. The only mild criticism is that the characters are almost too eloquent. As a sequel to Before Sunrise (1995) this could not be bettered.",
265,2 September 2004,colonel_green,10, Utterly majestic.,"In 1995, director Richard Linklater released a little romantic comedy called Before Sunrise, which made only 5 million dollars, but became a cult favourite on VHS/DVD.  Nearly a decade later, Linklater reunites with the film's stars (Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawk) to produce this sequel.  The motive clearly wasn't financial, given the rather limited success of the original; this was a labour of love for all involved.  I haven't seen the original film, but having seen the sequel, it has now become a major priority.  I must see where this all began. The plot is minimalist.  Jesse (Hawk) is now a successful writer, and is touring Paris when he encounters Celine (Delpy).  Jesse and Celine wander around the city for an hour and a bit, with Jesse's imminent departure the film's ticking clock.  The plot is not the point; this film relies on dialogue and the strength of the two actors' performances.  French actress Julie Delpy is truly radiant as Celine, instantly becoming one of my favourite actresses.  Ethan Hawk, who has done little work seen by me since Dead Poets Society, is also great as Jesse.  No other actor has more then a couple of lines. The dialogue of Before Sunset is wonderful, all of it feeling natural, never forced.

Can everything of value provoke symptoms? Art, movies, love, sex, dialogues, conversations, music and theater? Is that why society sometimes condemns art forms of sorts? To prevent a movement of unpredictable thought?

I thought that the one on-going scene was annoying and that the characters were so completely self-absorbed that it ultimately turned me off. Ethan Hawke's answers at the beginning did not feel like real answers to me (""Isn't everything autobiographical?"" - What does that mean?), and Julie Delpy's role didn't seem personable or that deep. The dialog to me seemed so stilted that I got uncomfortable just watching the movie. The neat thing about this movie is that it really is centered on just those two characters. When that is done well, it can be riveting. But that makes it high risk - if you don't like the characters, there is nothing else in the movie.

The picture began with Jesse wrapping up his book tour in Paris, and was blushing red while answering questions about his work which I found out as the movie goes along, was the romanticized version of his and Celine's love affair that did not happen. She came and saw him at the bookstore that he was in and went on from there. They reacquaint themselves with each other, spawning endless conversations from every conceivable topic. They also can't help but look back from that day in Vienna and wondered what if. I just recently saw Before Sunrise, the prequel to this film, and must say that I enjoy this one more, only because the topics of conversations were more mature, and the romantic notions were more realistic.

In the sequel, she is older, thinner, and (if possible) sexier, adding a degree of sophistication and a greater sense of style to her youthful beauty and innocence. Despite having become rather cynical and pessimistic, she carries herself with more confidence and has developed her talents, which she illustrates at the conclusion of the film when she sings the song she wrote for Jessie about their night in Vienna.

You are not afraid but you are living the moment. Maybe I saw the film when I was at the correct age... I'm close to the age that Jess and Celine were in the first film and I new that this could be real, that this could have happened to someone at that age! The way that both actors were on the first film was as they were connected somehow making it so real that you could caught yourself thinking and hopping that there will be a classic -Hollywood made- happy ending to make sure that's just a movie and nothing more! But no, no compromise whatsoever! And now to ""Sunset"" which starts with both characters acting awkward, playing hide and seek. They are now older, 9 years older, which make every person change a lot and they are both afraid each other. You need less than 15 minutes in the movie and you realise that you feel like the first movie, but now is even better! You are sure that this is real life, you can easily be convinced that it's a home-made video or a movie based on a real life! As the minutes go by and you see them revealing themselves to each other once again after all this time you feel no acting but real feelings between them. The act of deception in all it's glory! Hawk and Delpy better than ever before and Linklater just brought reality in a way that no one could ever imagine as possible! If I had to chose a film to watch for full 24hours that would be it.

Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy return and in addition to acting they also helped with the screenplay and are credited for the effort. The acting is effortless and the fact that the characters as well as the actors have aged exactly the same way adds to the realism that this movie aims for. Richard Linklater does not disappoint with the sequel that manages to stand as a great film on its own without comparing it to Before Sunrise.

295,9 July 2004,jmc4769,8, Great movie except for the ending,"OK, this is fair warning. Before Sunset is all talking. I would describe it as a romantic My Dinner with Andre or maybe an intellectual chick flick. The movie is one extended conversation between the two lead characters, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy). They walk through the streets of Paris, they have coffee at a local cafÃ©, they walk some more, they take a boat ride on the Seine, they are driven to her apartment, she invites him in, they talk a while in the apartment, movie over. That's it. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, forget it. You won't like the movie. People who don't like Julie Delpy or her character won't like the movie either because she has about two-thirds of the lines. Personally, I was fascinated by the conversation, and I thought Celine was mesmerizing. I did have one huge problem with Before Sunset. It ended too abruptly, before the end of the conversation. I wanted to see how things turned out, but the movie just leaves you hanging. At the screening I went to, there was a collective gasp from the audience at the end because we weren't expecting it to be over. My bottom line - great movie except for the ending (8 out of 10).",
296,1 July 2010,contactshantanu,10, Stealing back those hours that could have been...,"""Before Sunset"" is definitely one of those few select films which are great sequels to their predecessors. The funny thing is you don't ever feel inclined to critique such films, you just want to bask in its sunlit perfection, walk with the characters in the eternal city of Paris and get lost in a reverie. It's like a capsule of time taken out of the entangled lives of these two dislodged yet strangely connected souls, a page in their journal. You seem to project those unexplained emotions in your heart in the brilliantly portrayed characters, lose yourself in the meandering by- lanes of Paris and the words and repartee of the protagonists and you realize slowly with the characters the cost of missed opportunities and those painful could-have-beens. Despite the expected pragmatic, mature tones of the characters neither Jesse nor Celine could fully escape the effects of that intoxicating night at Vienna all those years back as we are left to imagine how it must have been in that original moment for it reverberate through the rest of their life leading up to Paris. And just like before, they set out to create another litany of vignettes that will surely go on to have repercussions in their lives. At the end you feel like it's the perfect sequel to ""Before Sunrise"", like you have always imagined Jesse and Celine to steal a few lost hours from the eternal flow of time and continue the conversation they had 10 years back in Vienna. The script, the walk and talk shoot, Nina Simone and that waltz song goes on to show the burgeoning brilliance of Linklater, ably assisted by Ethan and Julie. Echoing Jesse at the beginning of the movie here's the perfect test to examine if you are a romantic or a cynic - if you love Before Sunset you are bound to be a true romantic.",

It was as if I was the proverbial ""fly on the wall"" listening in on a very plausible, convincing personal conversation between two people who fell in love nine years ago and haven't seen each other since . . . or forgotten each other for so much as a minute. I was totally involved in this movie from near the start until the last minute . . . which is perfectly done. At the end, you know what's going to happen right then, but not where the next few hours will lead. There has to be another update to this story which takes us to where they are in, say, 2009.

It was a simple romance of a boy who meets a girl on a train and both of them take a walk around Vienna. What unfolded in ""Before Sunrise"" made me bite down my initial cynical view of it and extol its greatness. ""Before Sunset"", on the other hand, is a story of a boy who meets a girl again. I always wanted to find out what happened to the characters of Jesse and Celine after the abstruse ending in the first part. Understandably, ""Before Sunset"" was like a breath of fresh air and, like the characters it involves, it was like catching up with old friends.",

I don't remember details about the characters or even their promise to meet again. That didn't matter. My companion didn't see the first movie at all, but that didn't lessen her enjoyment.

What's more, it affected me very personally. It really forces you to reflect on your own life. Even with movies I love, my enjoyment is usually of a very abstract, aesthetic kind...I admire this or that thing, this bit of dialogue, the way that scene was lit. With Before Sunset, I can't even comment on it so bloodlessly. I felt like I was face to face with my own joys and disappointments when I was watching it. A masterpiece. Richard Linklater is probably the most gifted and humanistic director alive...which is strange, because he's so unprepossessing, and has no particular aura of auteurist holiness. (Bully for him).

The movie is completely dialogue-based, and in order to pull a movie like that off, you must have an amazing script and amazing actors.  In this case, both are present.  The movie flows so well, and Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy interact so well, you would think that Linklater encouraged them to improvise practically the entire movie, but during the Q&A session after the screening he said that not one line was improvised.

The manor-isms in their conversations felt real at times, yet at times it seems as though they were trying too hard to make the conversations(the jokes, laughter, stories, playfulness) seem realistic to the point that it was annoying...i feel as though they did not pull that part off in this film...things i did enjoy about the movie were the following shots while they were walking instead of a lot of cuts, the long shots i feel like are harder to pull off...and i thought that the ending and storyline was good...unfortunately it just did not intrigue me and i became bored with it...if anyone else felt this let me know",

It was a little too real, like watching Julie Roberts change a diaper, yeah it's ""Julia Roberts"" Whoo Hoo, but ultimately... it's just someone changing a diaper. As we find out how profound of an effect each of them had on the other, I would have thought they'd run out of small talk much sooner, faced with the reality of a life's obsession presenting itself in person.",
321,25 April 2019,mnagaditya,10, If u think before sunrise is the best... This is even better,The way this movie starts is very interesting and without wasting any time it makes them meet so effortlessly in a way that we feel like there is no time gap between the movies. Or it is may be I am binge watching the trilogy. The question of whether they meet after 6 months is answered in a very minimalistic and beautiful way.

322,15 February 2015,FedRev,10, A definitive statement on love in the modern world,"In 1995, Richard Linklater released Before Sunrise, and every nine years since has released a sequel. While sharing certain characteristics, each film is unique and worthwhile in their own right, but taken as a whole, this trilogy is something truly special. Some say that they are the best films about love and romantic relationships ever made, and they just might be. The series follows Jesse and Celine through the years. Jesse is an American traveling through Europe when he meets a French girl who is on her way home to Paris. They get to talking and Linklater's camera follows their conversation throughout the rest of that single day as the two fall in love. And every nine years, we revisit the couple at a different stage of life. Because of the time between the films we get the unique experience of watching two characters age, retaining the core of their personality, but taking on greater complexity as the years pass. The first film is about embracing the moment and forging a genuine human connection. The second film, Before Sunset, is about the regret of missed opportunities and the need to be true to yourself. The third film, Before Midnight, is about the consequences of actually getting what you want. Each film utilizes long takes which pull the audience deeply into the dialogue heavy narrative, and the fantastic performances by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy belie the fact that they're actually acting. These magical films are not to be missed.",

I love this movie, probably due to the same reason most people who post reviews about it love it.

Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do something much greater than give performances Â— they give of themselves. They listen to each other, and when is the last time you watched a film and noticed that. Their sensitivity toward the material means they do not miss a note, or rather they miss many notes, just as two nervous people would. They play with each other, and every time a character says something that seems dishonest, the other character calls them on it.

The geography was all wrong.. the dialogue was poor, the acting way way below par and totally unconvincing. How on earth did it get a rating of 8?

330,13 January 2021,Senryu-Cherry,9, some moments of life become our entire life,"This movie is surreal. I can't even believe how the crew especially these actors pulled off this absurd storyline. There is no specific plot in it, they made a whole movie about 2 people just talking while walking in places which gives little glimpses of how the non-Parisian media sees Paris. Nothing out of the ordinary. That's what exactly the beauty of this movie is. They brought a conversation from a normal day and reminded us this is how people behave, this is how we miss people, this is how we have conversations, this is how memories are made, this is what life is. The conversations are interlaced so smoothly. It is deeply intellectual but done in such a casual manner- that sounds like people talking about their next meal.
This movie is a character study. I love how in the movie Jesse talks about why he wrote a book about that one moment of his life. This movie is the real-life reflection of that marvellous concept.
The only reason I'm not giving it full stars is because of the 1 problematic tangent of cheating. Well, I believe having strong romantic feelings (except nostalgic) for some else is cheating. Despite that, I love this movie, definitely on the top of my list of romantic movie recommendations.",

The idealized and rather immature notion of romance is gone, but parts of it is sought after by both Celine and Jesse, who face the all-too-familiar stage of loneliness and boredom in the mundane aspects of their days.  Powerful and heartbreaking, their conversations reach so much deeper than simply a declaration of love, but also encompasses confession and understanding of pain and loss.

I couldn't help but relate to the young (my age), somewhat naive couple. Now it seems rehashed, a little jaded and I couldn't help but feel that it was more like watching the DVD extras than a sequel - its only slightly longer than an hour and is just like the first, with less tension and uncertainty.

I watched ""Before Sunrise"" after I saw this one and was quite disappointed. The actors and the story are more mature in the sequel. Maybe I am too old to identify with the mid-twenty Jesse and Celine and feel more comfortable with the mid-thirties you see in ""Before Sunset"". If you watched ""Before Sunrise"" you can see what difference nine years make. They both have their lives, they both are less adventurous then they were back then. But as they wander through the beautiful set of Paris, talking about anything, the two remember and regret what they had back then and what decisions they made. What could've been? And what could be? The movie follows a slow pace, Celine and Jesse just walk through Paris, talking. But the movie is far from being boring. After it was over I couldn't believe over an hour had passed.

I think this trilogy is the best romantic saga ever created on the big screen (have't watched the 3rd one though). I read other reviews about this movie here on IMDb and i must say, they all are matured audiences and who know how to appreciate the class from the mass. The main reason of me liking these movies is because they are not glamorized by the Hollywood (like twilight and many others) aura. This is just just story about a guy and girl who meet for a very brief time and are running out of it. So all they do is talk some sensible things which definitely a generous man would understand and it is their so realistic conversations that feels like eavesdropping on a couple is the heart and soul of this movie.

Here they're a bit older and wiser and the conversation feels less natural and more forced. The randomly deep insights, while impressive, clash a bit with the other insecurities and awkward jokes. Their current relationship is possibly too stuck in romanticising the original, therefore giving them false expectations of what they have now, but this doubt can probably go down as a plus for the film.

Before Sunset is life, it is experience. Anyone that has ever met someone they ""kind of like"" and wanted to find out more about them will know what this film is about. This is missed opportunity, this is chance, this is the roll of the dice and the one that got away.

The movie is about coming together of two people who met each other a long time ago and fell in love but circumstances did not allow them to, they talk about politics, environment, love, sex, relationships but the feelings that evolve after meeting one another is what I feel is the USP of Before Sunset. If u see Before Sunrise and u come to know that there is a sequel to it u will go for Before Sunrise before too long. Before Sunset goes well beyond weaving the emotional drama then its predecessor, and the question it asks of viewers towards the end is quite sentimental. Through an answer from Ethan at the start of Before Sunset the director seems to make his point of view of why keep the viewers in dilemma. The chemistry between the lead pair is superb and no wonder Julie and Ethan were actively involved in dialog writing for the movie. The ten yr gap between the two movies seem to be well thought out in the script as well as well as the makeup of the artists. The movie is not for those who cannot stand the marathon dialogs between same two characters for a continuous period of one and a half hours. After seeing the movie you seem to be looking for the next sequel and whether we will get another romantic fiesta from Ethan, Julie and company is a question that remains in mind for the viewers",
352,25 July 2022,jessekneblik,9, I loved it,"My wife and I watched before sunrise when we were dating and both liked it. We became married and eventually watched before sunset. It really recaptured the feeling, had some hard truths in it, still positive and carried on the feeling, we both loved it. The last instalment wasn't so hopeful and I don't think I watched all of it( I'm a romantic so I want aq good outcome). I would recommend Before Sunset if you like dramas, like a positive outlook. Its helpful to know what happened in before sunrise before you watch this one though.",
353,25 September 2013,deepampathak,8, A different tune of celebrationÂ….,"While the hypnotic mist that engulfed me after watching the first movie 'Before Sunrise', of the trilogy by Richard Linklater, was yet to settle down, I had a chance to watch its sequel, 'Before Sunset', soon after. Two strangers, Jesse and Celine, who had spent a loquacious and romantic day together, exploring the streets of Vienna, were supposed to meet after 9 long years and I was very pretty curious and anxious to know what had happened before and what would happen now that they would be meeting again. Eventually, the movie turned out to be an awesome manifestation of strong emotions trapped within for years - as if a kind of low intensity volcano that doesn't erupt catastrophically but, never-the- less, changes the landscape of the minds of the protagonists and how they react to it. The movie, for most part, rests heavily on its strong script and powerful acting of the two lead characters (it's hard to believe that the protagonists themselves â€“ Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy â€“had co-authored the script). So one needs to be all ears to fully immerse and enjoy their coming face to face with the reality and tackling it. This demanded a very judicious and effortless acting on the part of the lead pair and Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy had done an excellent job of it. Their acting is so natural that most times they seem to be playing for themselves rather than performing their roles. Also their body chemistry is extremely enjoyable. It seems the body chemistry they developed before, while playing their roles in the first movie of the trilogy, had come handy and they have improved upon it further in this movie. The director, Richard Linklater, and his cinematographer, had a formidable task at their hands of holding the audiences together till the very end since the movie solely depended upon the script & acting with not much of the scenic locations, visuals or twists & turns in the plot. But in the end, they had done a brilliant job of it. Intensely dramatic scenes are handled delicately without glycerin filled tears or nerve breaking sobs. Then they made judicious use of light highlighting happy, sad or tense situations, For instance, the lead pair glows in the sunlight when they ferry across the river Seine in Paris in a joyous mood while darker shades of light are used to depict tense situations. This thoughtful use of light elevates the given situation beyond measure and, at times, even communicates in absence of any dialogue from the actors. This variable display of light seems not merely coincidental but a meticulously planned creation of the director and so are the unusually long takes between the shots. Maybe not realized by less discerning viewer, many small but deft & creative directorial touches go on throughout the movie that keep the audience glued to their seats till it reaches its pinnacle - the concluding song- 'A waltz for the night'. The song (also written & performed on screen by Julie Delpy) is the real gem â€“ a cherry on the top! Its sweet rendition echoes in your ears as you leave the auditorium and its sure to remain further with you for a very long time. So go watch it! The movie is a juxtaposition of art, music and crafty film-making which eventually sings a different tune of a celebration that an elite film-lover can't afford to miss.",
354,3 September 2004,jk8n,9, It is the most realistic romantic movie I've ever seen...,"Before Sunset picks up nine years later and, unbelievably, it is an even better film. Actually, I'm not sure which of the two films is really better, except that ""Before Sunset"" is more relevant at this stage of my life and ""Before Sunrise"" is now more nostalgic. They are both so perfect in every way, and I can't think of another film like them. I guess Linklater was influenced by that genre of French films in which ""a man and a woman have a conversation about life and love and not much else happens."" The difference is that so often in the French films the conversation is banal, pretentious or self-important, posing as something more profound. Linklater's dialog is so natural; it moves from the mundane to the intelligent without a single false note. Both films were written and directed by Richard Linklater who does this kind of talky, real-time, thoughtful and realistic slice of life better than anyone (his film, ""Slacker,"" was a masterpiece). The story of Before Sunrise/Sunset is about serendipitously finding one's soulmate (for lack of a better word) at the wrong time, and desperately trying to forget and move on, but utterly failing. In the case of the couple in the film, they discover each other when they are students traveling on a train through Europe; he's American, she's French. When they unexpectedly meet again nine years later they learn that, in the intervening years, neither had found anything remotely close to what they shared in their brief time together, and they reconnect so easily, it's as if only a couple of months had passed. Once again, as in the first film, their timing is off; neither are free to drop everything else in their lives to take the plunge and play out the romance. As the Ethan Hawke character puts it so well, ""It is a choice between being my best self or my honest self.""",

For example we should not think or worry at all about the fact that Jesse is married or if Jesse and Celine get together at the end. It really does not matter. We should just focus on the magic they create when they are together. We should just live like them in that particular moment and periodically looking back to the past.

Congratulations to the two principals for carrying the entire movie on the strength of one nonstop dialogue....indeed, I have never seen a movie that even attempted such a premise. Hawke and Delpy actually carry it out. I was tired, and listened to much of the first half of the movie with my eyes closed. Yes, I might have even nodded-off for a few minutes. But the thread of dialogue kept my interest up enough that I had to start watching at about the same time the two were at Notre-Dame Cathedral. Now I know I don't need to see Paris - this movie was the ultimate travelogue of the River Sienne. The shoreline promenade evoked memories of ""A Tale of Two Cities"" and it's dramatic end. Now that I think about it, I doubt they really had such elaborate concrete work in the days of the French Revolution, only in the Liam Neeson movie of it. Funny, how the setting had such a timeless aspect to it. Anyway, I digress....could they have pulled-off this eighty-five minute conversation (in real time: probably about three hours of relationship time) on a blank sound stage, without the beautiful backdrop of Paris to enhance their every word?

367,18 June 2006,timmaksimuk,8," There is much love, but not enough time.","You would think an entire film consisting of just dialogue could bore the heck out of you, and if you are a action-craving Hollywood blockbuster guy, you would probably be better off watching ""Die Hard."" But if you're up for a film with top quality acting and a solid script, you will probably remember this film as one of your favorite love stories. Richard Linklater pulls our attention throughout the entire film by allowing the audience to experience the emotional and psychological drama through each character's eyes while leaving enough distance to witness the events from a neutral perspective. With his accessible plot he creates much emotional and dramatic sequences within the small time-frame: former two lovers walking down the streets of Paris. By the time you realize this film purely consists of dialogue, you'd most probably want it to stay that way. The two major elements in this film are reminiscent emotions of a previous relationship and the little time in which two ex-lovers can share these emotions. Much of the talking seems to be a means of observation, while most of the communication seems to take place at a more subtle level. The physical expressions in can be observed with the fine acting of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who seem to be playing real-life lovers, especially for those who have seen ""Before Sunrise."" I haven't seen such a satisfying love story in a long time; it was quite refreshing to watch a love story that didn't make me feel mellow nor optimistic: this film, was neither.",

My mom and I just about always watch DVD's and video's together (we have the same taste most of the time), she'd probably think this one is boring because it's all talk and no actual action (in sense of fighting or running and stuff). I usually go for a little speed in movies as well, don't get me wrong I like movies like this but when I'm in a videostore I don't go out of my way to find a jewel like this. I tend to go look for a good action/comedy or a thriller, but I just loved this movie. The story has no elaborate scheme to it, it was just so simple, the whole concept and how everything played out. It was so serene and just calm but up beat (it's somewhat contradicting I know) and in a real sense. The movie has a pace but like real time, it's not like a day went by in several minutes.

372,15 January 2013,ng_open_air,7, Love story for anyone,"Just before writing this review, I took a quick look at the Board where people discussed this film's ending. There are so many interesting theories about what might have happened afterwards, and you can see how people are intrigued with the openness of all the questions left unanswered, when the screen turns black. It is not so much about the mystery, but rather provoking people's imaginations and more importantly arousing their own romanticism. I think that, in a way, the people were actually describing what they would do if they were Jesse or Celine. This is what I like the most about this movie (actually both movies), it kind of makes any viewer recognize him or herself in one of the two main characters. Because these characters really can be any one of us. And this concept, in my opinion, is what makes this film a winner - two ordinary people meet in a random place and fall in love. They are not your typical Hollywood love story characters, and that's a good thing as well, because if they were, this film would be as boring as hell. As Celine says when commenting on how long it took Jesse to write the book: ""Wow, that's a really long time to be writing about one night."" Both movies are quite uneventful and ordinary, but it's not about events anyway, the characters and the mood alone keep viewers in suspense throughout the picture. In its raw simplicity, both films evade tiring or confusing the viewer, thus making it a lot easier to just give in to the overwhelming emotions.",

There are long uncut scenes that must have been quite difficult for the Steadicam crew, but the results are quietly amazing.

What i must say is that are few valuable words to rate these films. Because this is about feelings. About that ""one in a lifetime love passion"" we once had, or we luckily are having, or yet, we wish we had had. Everything is perfect, Julie Delpy as Celine, Ethan Hawke as Jesse, Richard Linklater the director, the cleverest dialogs in movie history, the less known sites of Viena first, Paris after, etc, etc. Everything so ""real live"", ""real people"" that we viewers, become Jesse and Celine! They are us! We are them! Or we wanted to be... There were great love movies and there will be made great movies in the future, that's for sure. But these two will remain forever in my short top ten ranking. If you miss ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" you will never forgive yourselves! We get to the end of the movies, seeing the credits with a big and happy smile in our face. Next days later we search on the net more stories about ""sunrise"" and ""sunset"", the complicity with that young and then, 9 years older nice couple, grows and grows.

It's about how taking a chance on someone, setting yourself up for embarrassment, and throwing caution to the wind can lead to a fulfilling interaction, regardless of how brief that interaction may be. Jessie and Celine are riding a train through Europe, but they are sitting in different parts of the train and have never met. An argument between a middle-aged couple causes Celine to leave her seat and take the one across the aisle from Jessie. They share an uncomfortable smile when the fighting couple rushes past the two of them.

387,19 November 2005,author-21,9, Wanna know what happened next? I'll tell you :-),"So, here's my take on what happens next after this movie ends: Jesse and Celine make love, passionately, in every corner of her apartment, until the following morning at about five-thirty. Jesse writes Celine a tortured, ""we both knew we couldn't be together"" note on her telephone message pad, pins it to the 'fridge with a magnet, and disappears out into the damp Paris pre-dawn to call the valet and get a lift to the airport for a later flight. Why do I feel all of this so strongly? Well, it works on the same logic as Helen Hunt's character not getting back together with Chuck at the end of Cast Away: Clearly Jessee loved, has loved, loves, and will always love Celine -- but the movie makes it equally clear that, as much as they are mourning the missed opportunity in Vienna, they are also mourning the loss of their own youth; and one of the hallmarks of losing one's youth is that you start to choose responsibilities over passions. If the next sequel doesn't open with them having another chance meeting after having not seen each other for another nine years, I'm going to cry foul. I mean, come on: they're in their thirties now -- they know better than to start permanently mucking-up each others' lives.",

Unfortunately, as we were both poor college students and lived a long way from each other, we decided not to contact each other for the exact reasons that Jesse and Celine didn't in Before Sunrise.

I put the maximum number of stars since IMDb is hell bent on only giving the good reviews priority to the readers as opposed to giving priority on the first come first serve basis. Both movies were a french-wannabee flick using only dialog as its mechanism. The problem is that the characters are Americans and Americans talk about the stupidest things, as we see throughout the entire movie. We have a Joe Mangina douche bag who is smitten with this self entitled princess. He actually shows up to meet this bimbo at a place and time they agreed to meet 9 years ago and of course she is not there. The chick is a typical narcissistic American female, passed her prime at age 33, complete with her selfish attitude as she stated that she wished someone had proposed marriage to her and then turns around and says ""I would have said no, but it would have been nice to have been asked"" so really her desire is not to be married but rather to flush down the toilet a mans genuine affections of love.

The songs Julie Delpy sings are enchanting and lets your mind drift in and out of the story. Well done. Unlike other films, this one grabs your attention with sensitive dialog, intrigue and poignant moments. A classic love story from start to finish. I would put this up there with To Catch A Thief, North By Northwest or An Affair To Remember. It leaves you wanting more. So much more...",
395,7 September 2005,tas22,10, One of the best movies of 2004,"Along with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, this has to be one of my favorites from 2004. The movie is very talky and sometimes wanders dangerously into pretension, but nevertheless reaches beauty and profundity frequently against a stunning Parisian backdrop. What could be better? Before Sunrise was a bit too wide eyed and romantic for me, but Before Sunset hits melancholy notes that ring true with every bittersweet insight. The screenplay, written by the director and the two leads, is a gem and is realized with conviction and sensitivity by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who have never been better in my opinion. Love is all too evident between Jesse and Celine, and we are privileged to share the experience.",
396,3 January 2018,DeeKyuBee,10," Their older, bolder, better","Before Sunrise follows Jesse (Ethan Hawke) who is now a bestselling author and reconnects with Celine (Julie Delpy) in Paris as Jesse is having a book tour as he's become a bestselling author. It follows similar territory as the first film but in my opinion, it is better and might be my favorite film out of the three films.
You can just feel the vibe of Paris and the characters wonderment even just watching their back 
 The biggest improvement that this sequel does than its predecessor is the pacing. It is about 20 minutes shorter than the first film giving it a brisk 80 minute run time. Another reason why this film works better is how mature the main characters are. In the first film, Jesse and Celine, although way more mature and intelligent than anybody typically is their age, they were still young and didn't have as much life experience to have even more thought-provoking conversations about life itself.",
397,6 June 2005,k03prl,7, Not quite as good as I hoped for,"I think it was three or four years ago I accidentally came across ""Before sunrise"" while zapping through the channels on a slow TV-night. This was one of those rare movie experiences, where you are totally absorbed, almost drawn in to the movie, not for a single moment losing focus on whats happening on the screen. Being an 18 y-old guy, romantic movies weren't usually what I was looking for, but this one was different. It felt so real, but in the same time so magic. At the end of the day, I think the reason why I, and so many others, love this film, is that you think and hope that you someday will have a similar experience. It somewhat feels like the ultimate romantic situation, the two of them walking around in the beautiful city of Wienna, discussing everything between heaven on earth while the night slowly turns to morning.",
398,15 January 2021,neokatsapas,10," Before Sunrise is one of my favorite romance films, and it's sequel, Before Sunset, may be even better.","The most impressive element of these two movies is easily the fact that they manage to make a single, twenty minute long conversation about completely random subjects extremely engaging, while still maintaining realism and subtlety. This film is even more impressive than the first in that regard, because the entire runtime only takes place in around five locations and, unlike the first, is set completely in real time. So the entire film really is just an hour and twenty minutes of these characters lives put on screen, which works because they really do feel like real people. This is achieved by the excellent, grounded performances, with actors who have great chemistry with each other and perfectly capture their characters detailed mannerisms, which subtly tell the viewer a lot about them. These protagonists have so much depth that they truly feel as if they live outside of the film, that they have a life which isn't even shown. That's also not to mention how excellently this film captures the way people talk, with every conversation being realistically slow paced, repetitive and lacking a clear point. Much like the first, this movie also perfectly captures the awkwardness of these characters situations, which at times is surprisingly funny because of how real it feels.",

There is lots of information about the sunrise so, you don't need to watch sunrise to understand what is going on in sunset.The guitar solo of Jesse is awesome , she is not only a good a actress but also a good singer.

Linklater didn't just just write a story which will melt anyone's heart but was able to bring it life to make it real.Well Done Richard Linklater! this film isn't just a nice sequel of the original film but also completes the story and keep you hungry for more.As we know,Jesse and Celine love each other so much that they were like meant to be together and this film focuses on how you'll react when find your lost perfect match whom you were meant to be with and after all these real life suffering what will do when you finally find them.The movie was artistic,at first i was starting to think if there's anything wrong with celine but as the story flows it made everything clear.At some points of the movie,You'd just love to see the facial expressions of them especially when celine sings song.iI just fall for that scene.Ending was a suspense but i like it that way. This isn't a typical romantic movie we use to watch,it got spark.and thats why i think it's Classic.",

I felt I was with them, walking around eavesdropping on their conversation. It was excellent! I found the actors were able to maintain their chemistry mixed with anticipation of what each of them was going to do next. Both actors did a great job of appearing nervous yet natural. It was nice to see both characters had evolved, yet remained the same. I felt both ethan and julie did a fantastic job of recreating their connection. I also appreciated a bit of a tour of Paris in the film. Since ethan is visiting Paris it was nice to capture his perspective of Paris. All in all, I really loved it.",

In this particular case, ""Before Sunset"" does not hold a candle to the original. It does not have to, since it IS the original. If I have never seen the first on, and only saw this, I would still think it is one of the most masterfully movies ever made. Yet, it is hard not compare the two in the context of the change of the characters. And even though the ""younger"" version was maybe more about romantic, this one has more of a sense of urgency. The whole movie, they had a lot less time to catch up than the last time, so they have to get more out in the open in shorter time, being more cautious adults this time. This is probably one of the few films your don't really have to see the original before. I know many people will disagree, but I compare it to listening a foreign opera with no subtitles: enjoy the emotion, understanding will come later. And as a side note, both the director and the stars (Delpy and Hawke) are producers and writers, which is yet another reason to see this film.",

Coming into I had not seen ""Before Sunrise"" (you do NOT have to see it, Before Sunset gives you the back story). I was truly amazed at how Director Richard Linklater does with words. The whole movie is crafted upon conversation, often funny, sometimes sad, but always containing insight. Actress Julie Delpy gives an amazing performance as the neurotic Celine. Ethan Hawke, too, stands his ground as regretful Jesse. The actors were terribly denied any acting awards, which is a true shame. Another nice thing about the film is the lovely scenery. Taking place in gorgeous Paris, we get to see the inner city, parks, cafÃ©'s, and more. The soundtrack is also worth picking up. Actress Julie Delpy serves as chanteuse to the record with 3 of her lovely songs on there, including ""A Waltz For A Night"" which she performs in character at the end of the film. This is one of my favorite films and I hope this review makes it one of yours as well!",
412,27 July 2004,PulpFiction1987,10, The Best Movie of the Year So Far **** out of ****,Richard Linklater's Before Sunset is the long awaited sequel to Before Sunrise and is also the best film of the year so far. The dialog just like every Linklater film is absolutely flawless and the performances are too. This is one of the most unconventional love stories ever made even though it uses a few key elements. This film is even better than its predecessor because the characters are more developed and more life like this time around. After this film is over it leaves you with a warm feeling in your stomach that's saying everything will be alright. The story is simple its two people a man (Ethan Hawk) and a women (Julie Delpy) who had fallen in love over one night nine years ago but agree to go there separate ways and meet exactly six months later but neither do and they meet by chance a second time and go over the night in there memories and talk about new issues and thoughts.

Why would I love the movie in which two people just walk in beautiful scenes of Paris and talk about completely different subjects? Plus there was nothing special about acting. And about music.

The people, the events, the talk, the circumstances all are real and may even remind of your own lives. Highly recommended. I wished that more movie like this were made.

'before sunset' is a very nicely made film. this time the two lead characters got older and wiser. and it reflects in their interaction. this time they met in Paris and spent few hours before sunset. during this time they shared their memories, the events in their lives since the first film. the whole film is centered on their interaction. but you will never get bored. you will love it so much. the dialogues were great, cinematography was nice, music was awesome. most of all, julie delpy and ethan hawke seemed so made for each other. they gave the performances so real that it seemed like they really met after nine years. and at last credit goes to the director for making such a wonderful sequel.",
420,5 July 2004,keilenberg,10, Praise of the film and discussion of some reasons why it works so well,"""Before Sunset"" is one of the most exquisite romantic modern films I have ever seen. It is reminiscent of the following two movies: Claude Lelouch's ""Un homme et une femme"" (""A Man and a Woman"" 1966) and Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Trois couleurs: Rouge"" (""Red"") in that it is a magnificent study of the inner workings of a relationship between two people who meet accidentally: a man and a woman. But their ages, nationalities, and successes (things often used to classify people) are not why the characters in these movies connect. These films are brief glimpses of details that make relationships so intense and so special. The backdrop of Paris adds a lushness to the film's beauty, and it is a comment on the themes of movement, transience, and touring or visiting a place as opposed to living there and it becoming fabric in one's day-to-day ""real life."" At first viewing, the conversation between the two characters feels so natural, making it surprising to learn that there is no adlib in this film. However, at second viewing, (We stayed for the very next showing of the film!) the brilliance of the construction of the conversation became obvious. Every word is fraught with risk and meaning, even in the beginning of the movie, as the characters talk around the subject of their relationship so masterfully, while using it as every referential point in their dialogue.",

426,23 December 2004,natspirits,4, Not so hot!! Lacking severely in the romance department!,"I'd like to reject what another commentator wrote about ""Before Sunset"". This movie was slow, to be generous, and ended rather abruptly--without redemption. Eighty minutes of rather boring dialog with a plot line as repugnant. The characters, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), lacked chemistry and charisma. Ethan's forced diatribe left an uneasy feeling inside. The end was as bland as the beginning, a completely trite, over-used attempt at a cliffhanger. It is my understanding that in a romantic film, connection must be felt between the 'lovers'--obviously lacking in this flick. I have to say, any young lass would adore the bland commentary and lack of plot line, however. Even with the setback of being a sequel, this film doesn't come close to success. Nonetheless, Delpy and her cute French persona left the male viewer somewhat pleased--not enough to sit through with a date though. Linklater, Hawke, Krizan, and Delpy should give another shot at writing, just not a screenplay. Try a romance novel next time my friends. Not the best romantic film I've ever seen!",

I was impressed with a lot of the lines that just 'made you think.' I found myself thinking instead of keeping up with the movie, which I didn't mind - though some others might get annoyed.

There's no background music (like in the Dogma movies) and the scenes are simple. For example there's this scene in a cafe (a great, old french cafe with fantastic athmosphere). They sit there and talk .. for about 20 minutes of the movie. and it's not even boring for the viewer. I mean, it's so ""real"", and so exciting to watch them getting in touch again.

433,14 September 2004,Cricketlover43,10, True to life depiction of a timeless dilemma,"This riveting film ""works"". Who could not fail to relate to, or aspire to, connecting with someone at a spiritual level that transcends mere physical reality. Herein lies the strength of this film, for in abandoning the screen writing convention of ""show don't tell"" for exquisitely crafted dialogue in which the characters actually share ""real"" experience and emotion the film conveys what pictures alone cannot, the interior of the characters, and humanity in its ""natural"" state. The documentary style and intimacy generated by the dialogue leave the viewer feeling like they are right alongside the characters and actually sharing a real time experience. Who could not fail to be moved by the notion of deeply connecting with someone years previously, tearfully parting, suffering the pain of separated souls yearning to be re-united, and the self torture of wondering what might have been. Imagine years of being unable to remove the indelible imprint of a twin soul from the psyche, and the shock and exhilaration of meeting again years later. This 70 minute microcosm, packed with intervening life experience, personal development, emotions, blame, recriminations, and love that goes beyond the physical, undimmed by the passing years, induces alternating laughter and tears in the viewer. This is achieved by what is said, and also by what is not said but untuitively known by the viewer because they are drawn so integrally into the film, and by skillfully ""underplayed"" performances that generate empathy. The spellbinding performances subtly depict nervous and uncertain actions reminiscent of innocent and naive teenagers not knowing what to do for the best.

The beautiful couple now meet again, still beautiful but with more wisdom and bitterness. After a while we understand how much the brief encounter i Wienna really meant to them and their lovelies after that. For about 1 and a half hour the couple walks and talks about real stuff, the dialog is interesting and very honest. Ethan and Julie are truly believable.

So when I heard that Richard Linklater was making a follow-up to it, I was extremely excited and anxious (and I didn't even have to wait for 10 years between movies!). As much as I liked Before Sunrise, I think I like Before Sunset even more...the characters are so real-life it's almost scary and Delpy, Hawke and Linklater deserved their Oscar nomination for best screenplay, the dialog was so natural and realistic it didn't even seem scripted (and that's a huge compliment). The acting was phenomenal, for a film, shot in real time, involving only 2 characters walking through Paris talking about nothing and everything it held my attention and I think that was due in large part to Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, who I forgot were acting and almost believed were really their characters. This movie isn't flashy or loud or anything like that, it doesn't try to convey some huge philosophical message, it's just two people who met each other once and are now trying to make up for all the things in their lives they couldn't do with each other...so normal and sad and hopeful.

441,29 November 2017,alxunderkouts,8," A perfect example of a ROMANTIC movie THAT THE Characters DON'T EVEN KISS Each other OR HAVE SEX, and yet remains one of the most romantic films!!","...Another masterpiece from Richard Linklater.I recently learned that the first movie (before sunrise) was made by him because he wanted to find a girl that he had met and spent a night like that of the movie.He believed that if the girl would have seen the movie she could have tried to contact with him.In before sunset, he parallels his action of doing this film with the action of Jesse to write a book about the night with Celine, in order to find her...In this movie, indeed Jesse and Celine meet again each other, but this time they have continued their lives.Celine realizes that when we are young we believe that we will have the chance ,plenty of times, to connect with people, but in reality it only happens a few times.That in my opinion is the main message of this film.The biggest mistake that we can do, is to say that we will find another one in the future...NOOO, THIS IS THE TIME, THIS IS THE ONE!!! Another and last point that I would like to emphasize is when Celine says that many couples think that after a few years of living together, they would be in the same state of excitement,in the same passion and the consuming desire to be the same than in the beginning.And continues that this is impossible, because they would have ended up doing nothing at all with their lives, because of the constant heartbeat and desire for sex.Young couples must understand that this is natural and not lack of love.But, of course,in Jesse's situation there is also another important factor for his unhappiness, Celine!!And now fits perfectly the first observation that I made,THIS IS THE TIME, THIS IS THE ONE!!",
442,16 August 2004,macnugget,9, more than lives up to the first film,"The film is wonderful. If you saw the first, 'Before Sunrise', you'll definitely want to watch this sequel. I was very anxious about the prospect of a sequel to Sunrise which was a self- contained film that wasn't demanding a sequel. Although 'Before Sunrise' ended with an aching ambiguity I was dreading the prospect of a sequel because it would have been far too easy to screw it up and ruin the memory of the first. To their credit, they didn't. In fact, I found that Sunset surpasses Sunrise in depth and maturity. Both characters reappear now nine years later as more complex and with greater depth. The writing is spot-on and authentic, and it's clear that everyone involved has invested themselves into the film.",

Therefore, when you watch sunset, you literally cry in many scenes, just because of one word, one smile or one look which means so much implications behind it.The most touching part of love is that when you realize the person you keep thinking of is experiencing the same feeling and missing you that much.",

446,18 November 2005,k9proline,8, Excellent Drama,"Well, isn't this what life and love are all about? Consider the dynamics of two characters with an obvious untold passion for one another and you have the makings of a dynamic and intimate exchange of the heart. This movie is not big on special effects and mundane for those who desire visual excitement, but therein is the essence of a human drama which takes place on the streets of Paris, a coffeshop, a tourist's boat, and a chauffeured vehicle ride to a quaint apartment.",
447,1 December 2004,vic6string,9, Like nothing I've seen in a long time,"This movie (and its predecessor) might be the best character studies I have ever seen. There really is nothing but character development which may be a turn off to many (no effects, no big plot surprises, no stunts,,, really nothing but dialogue in both movies). I will say, you absolutely MUST see Before Sunrise first or this movie will be pointless. This is one of the most original movies I have seen in years, and is incredibly risky for the makers of the film. In today's short-attention-span society, a movie like this is really hard to pull off with most audiences. I was incredibly skeptical about a second movie when I heard it was coming out. I was afraid they would ""hollywood"" it a little and kill the magic of the first. Yhis, however was the perfect conclusion to the first. Everyone wanted to know if they re-met 6 months later, and that was answered, but the mystery of their future together (the best part of the first film) was retained. You need an open mind to watch these movies (and a bit of a romantic side) but they are well worth the couple of hours you put into them. This movie shows what 2 fantastic actors can do with a good script and incredible chemistry and not much else. I reserve 10 ratings for movies that define genres or change the way movie-making is done like the original Star Wars or Ben Hur, but I gave this movie a strong 9...maybe a 9.8 if they gave me decimals.",
448,4 December 2005,wildyeibi,9," Nice to see them back together, but not superior to the first movie","I really liked this movie. It was like being present in a two old friends reunion. It is mandatory to watch the first movie before this one because this is kind of an epilogue of their first encounter. Of course, this film does not stand up to the first one, but for those who loved the characters of Before Sunrise, it is like rediscover old friends and actually know what life has brought them to. Also, it has a connection with my life, as I watched the first movie when it was released several years ago, and I have grown up as a person as the characters in the film, so the basic topics they chatter about, growing older and becoming more cynical and skeptical about relationships and love, are familiar to me. I do not usually like open endings, but, in this case, I think it was justified, I really like the idea of them getting together and living happily ever after, but as the film shows us, there are many discrepancies between these two that it is very unlikely that this might happen. Maybe we will know what happened, in a future movie.",

Cornerstone for Hollywood i concerned this epic directed stuff. And Bravo for its Director who very found it by ease route to explain it to the viewers . Massive respect for all the people ,who played vital part in the making of before sunset .Synthesizing with the positive approach and self esteem that movies like these needs to be high rated rather so called IMDb ratings.",
450,30 March 2005,orkun-3,10, An excellent movie about the most meaningful search of our lives.,"Before Sunset is an excellent movie on the very basics of that feeling we have been searching for. It is a beautiful mixture of optimism and pessimism at the same time presented you in 80 unforgettable minutes. The dialogs will take you back on time and force you to question the past relationships. It is about hope, it is about despair. It is about not giving up when you most feel like to. This is a type of a movie that could encourage you to make a change in your life first time you get up in the morning. Or gives you the feeling to call that certain someone that you have been seeing in your dreams for a long time time now. I would really want to see the third leg of a trilogy within the intoxicating atmosphere of Istanbul.I would like to end by a quote from the film: ""Baby you are going to miss that plane""",

I have been like a kid on Christmas Eve ever since I found out Before Sunset was being made! Being the same age as Jesse and Celine, Before Sunrise resonated strongly with me then, and Before Sunset resonated even more strongly with me now. Thank you Richard, Ethan and Julie for wildly surpassing even my highest expectations for the continuation of Jesse and Celine's story.

456,19 November 2004,txevi,10, Simple and Perfect,"When I first saw Before Sunrise, I got caught by the performance and most of it by the story. I was a teenager, and to see that so romantic story in those ages, makes you search in your love life for that romanticism. After the ages, like the two characters, I have had a lot of ""problems"" in my love life for that reason, specially to get sex... They realize that such romanticism is impossible to keep, and they grow as adults also. But thank god or whoever, the second part of that marvelous movie exists, and that gaves us another vision of the romanticism and of the love stories. The second part is much more mature, much more bitter, but also much more realistic. In my opinion the fist one is very very nice, and a marvelous love story, but this second part is even better, for it's bitter vision of the ""tragedy"" of love. Well, I coud have written a lot more about this, but not now. Just say: Thank you Richard, thank you Ethan, and special thanks for Julie, 'cause you give us splendid songs!",

458,15 August 2005,abbutterflie,10, Brilliant brilliant film,"I love this film. I like it better than the first one. They're older, not so idealistic, so maybe it seems more realistic. And even more poignant, because now, second time round, you know they mustn't let the other get away, so throughout you sit holding your breath, waiting to see whether they do end up just talking again, just making the brief connection, or whether this time they really seize the moment and are prepared to risk allowing the connection to be permanent. I didn't realise how profoundly it had affected me, how many little bits of it have kept playing on in my subconscious since I saw it the first time round. And it's so subtle, like with the first one, the emotion is portrayed with just a glance or a gesture. A hand reaching out to touch the other but pulled back at the last moment, a look of longing or sadness, an angry outburst that you know is misdirected, but genuine nonetheless. It's harder to be as cynical about this one than it is about the first because they themselves aren't so naive, so even jaded people who don't believe true love happens outside of the movies, but still deep inside wish that the happy endings could be true if only life didn't get in the way, can find something to identify with.",

465,24 November 2004,flor_silesky,10," A ""thanks"" to the writers of the movie... a very personal comment","It's been such a long time, acting, pretending to be someone else - not one, but many- I no longer recognized myself. It sounds cheesy, and even normal, and that's what it is, completely normal. All human beings are supposed to belong, to adapt themselves. Even the criminals adapt themselves to a certain way of living, to a certain group, and they follow the description of their role in society like it was a prescription. I'm not implying to be different, or special, but the contrary, I am totally common, totally normal. Just another human being with an existential crisis, suddenly trapped in her comfort spotÂ… comfortable, but frustrated, adapted, but miserableÂ… fearing life, above all. Just recently I watched a film that made me feel like I had been raped. Like someone came and saw my naked mind, my naked soul, possessed it and wrote it down to shoot it later in ""before sunset"". I am nothing like the perfect beautiful blond actress, and certainly I am not a successful intellectual activistÂ… although I do like the ""wonder woman feeling"", helping here and there once in a while. And neurotic? maybe I am a little of that. One of the scene shots in that movie, named ""Dying inside"" told my love life story in less than 4 minutes. It's funny how insignificant you feel after such a thing happens. My concepts of love, romanticism, independence and frustration are there, in those 4 minutesÂ… along with the funny story of boyfriends that break up with me and get married, and call me later to thank me for showing them what love was. And that passive anger of not having been askedÂ… of not having deserved that honorÂ… While I am sure I would have said no, and I am sure none of them were the right oneÂ…if such a thing exists. I've been hiding for 5 years behind the wall of rationalism. Logic, strength, independence. And all these years I have longed for that experience of romantic love that was stolen once, or many times in my past. It's funny when it doesn't matter anymore to tell the truth out in the open, for anyone to see it grasp it and maybeÂ… get the courage to tell their ownÂ… I am just another womanÂ… longing for her blue prince to pick her up on a white horse and take her to his castleÂ… well not that simple of course. In my long 5 years of single life, I have managed to put together the most ridiculous huge and complicated list of perfect attributes for that blue princeÂ… In the end though, I guess it would be enough to know someone that makes me shiver just by the encounter of sights, that threatens my rational arguments and with whom I can forget the bullshit and simply be myselfÂ… but believe me that alone is too complex to even get close to realityÂ… It's funny how human beings love to complicate the beautiful simplicity of lifeÂ… and when it becomes a viceÂ… I doubt it has a way back. I have a confession to make, I am a weak daydreamer of romantic love, like any other cheesy womanÂ… And I am dying insideÂ… pretending all the time the strength and independence I don't have. I saw my self in that movie, like I dared to face a mirror for the first time in my lifeÂ… and found a tiny little creature too scared to even look straight into her eyes. I wish I could thank the writers... for ""stealing my story"", in the end maybe that's the story of everyone... and somehow, that's a relief. In the meantime, I'll keep on laughing at myselfÂ… until I am too tired to continue my own acting role and decide to show the real oneÂ… if that ever happens.",

It is rare in cinema today that the dialogue (and that's virtually all there is in Before Sunset -- conversation between the principals -- and thank God for that) is so real and so smoothly, naturally and humanly delivered that you (sweetly) fall into a state where you think you're eavesdropping on two people riffing off each other, responding to what comes up next and, above all, NOT working off a script.",

469,14 July 2006,warrenfriend,8, A great thought provoking flick,"Like its predecessor, Before Sunrise is one of those movies full of commentary on everyday life. Nothing heavy handed, just line after line of brilliant observation put into simple terms. If you're the kind of person with strong memories and consider yourself a product of your own mind this movie will appeal to you. Some won't care for the lack of apparent action but they're missing the point. There is plenty going on here. Though the dialogue is rich it only serves as an undercurrent. It casts no light on what's really going on here yet through it you see its shadow. Short and sweet. It even ended exactly when I thought ""it should end right now."" What happens next? Who knows?

Julie played superb and she closed the film in such great style that you simply couldn't avoid to enjoy happiness with Ethans character. Ethan, if you ever read this, please find more films of this kind. You give us a nice break for us seeing you in a strong character role instead of having some form of FBI agent character.

But this time, director Richard Linklater, with the help of these two incredible actors (Hawke and Delpy), manage to do the impossible.

All praise to Richard Linklater for bringing out a better sequel to his high-critically-acclaimed Before Sunrise. Keeping the essence intact, he brings his brain-children Jesse and Celine to the City of Love, Paris. The dialogs catch the viewers' attention and its a smooth glide from start to end. The performance of the two stalwarts stand out. Ethan Hawke as Jesse Wallace is flawless, but what takes this movie to another height is the bravura performance of Julie Delpy. The sensitive, sometimes erratic woman, Celine, she portrays comes to life and it is like she is giving you a tour of Paris. The screenplay is one of the best of the decade. Richard Linklater, along with his two character leads, Ethan and Julie, wrote the screenplay together that adds the edge. The songs are soothing, especially ""A Waltz For A Night"" and ""An Ocean Apart"". Nina Simone is also paid homage by a mesmerizing mimicry by Julie Delpy. The editing work could have been better. There are a few gaping flaws, or goofs as we know them. I have enjoyed the movie all the three times I watched it. The scenes remain in your head long after it is over.",

Apparently limited release means just that, and if you don't live in NY or LA, its very possible you wouldn't even know these movies exist. While its not necessary to have seen the first to enjoy this one, you owe it to yourself to know the entire story. Before Sunset picks up where Before Sunrise leaves off. Well, not quite. Its well after the six months agreed upon for the next meeting. Jesse has written a book about the fateful night he spent in Vienna, of all things. He's on the last leg of his book tour, which just happens to be Paris. As he's fielding his last question he catches a glimpse of a familiar face and somehow manages to wrap up the session w/o totally losing it. After a brief chat outside the bookstore, Jesse has the idea that Celine could show him around Paris before his plane leaves that evening, which she gladly agrees to. As the two learn more about the years that have passed they can't help but to be drawn closer. Closer to what is the only real question... Much like the first, this film is a great date movie, exploring the various insecurities we all have, the emotional baggage we accumulate over the years. It also goes into the whole ""what if"" factor of situations that don't receive the necessary closure and expands on how some moments really do stick w/us longer than we intend. Ultimately the film revolves around the many faces of love and the different roads that the search for it can lead us on.

Every moment spent together was and will always be precious. Filmed in beautiful Paris this movie is a delight, the acting is superb. It also opens the way to a sequel with a hopefully happy ending.

It tiptoes on the thread between logic and emotions and culminates as an ode to fate, achieving to present randomness as ultimate inevitability. Setting cynicism as the prevailing approach was most refreshing when one deals with the exploration of issues like love, experience and choice in a realistic manner for people in their 30s living in a modern western society. At the same time, conscious that it is dealing with the most fundamental of concepts it takes an aristophanic approach using regular swearing as an ideal means of the pervading cynicism. The combination of swearing and cynicism and the ultimate conclusion that love and choice can still be possible in todays cynical world has a massive impact; assisted by Nina Simone in the background it plays a tune of optimism to us all.",
487,19 August 2004,fabian-27,9," Better than my expectations, great acting","I happened to hit on 'Before Sunrise' about 5 years ago while zapping through the Telly, i was actually looking for the news but was caught by the movies atmosphere instantly. I had never seen a movie like that before; i really enjoyed it and i was inspired by the smart and interesting dialogs. Almost forgotten the movie, i now saw a poster for 'before sunset' and i started to remember the first part. I wasn't actually that eager to see the movie, because i thought that one couldn't top the first part anyway without copying it all in all. Furthermore, i thought the idea of it playing in Paris too much of a clichÃ© and considered that the movie would probably be just normal bad Hollywood sequel of some low class director who bought the rights of 'Before Sunrise', trying to make some easy dollars. Eventually i did go see it ( on the last day it played ), and was a lot better than my expectations:The movie is far more focused on the dialogue between the main actors. There are virtually no other actors in the movie ( except for some journalists and a guy standing at a grill ). There are hardly no interactions with other characters and during the whole 90 min movie there is no time-cut or time-gap. And the movie is definitely something new. The characters seem far more mature and seem to have laid off there naiv sides. I wouldn't even consider the movie a romance story any more, the theme is far more dramatic and subtle than the first part. The topic includes a lot more of the characters dark and vulnerable sides. Some parts though didn't fit in the atmosphere of the movie at all. The choice of profession of the main characters didn't really fit. She turned out to be an environmentalist and Ethan Hawke became a famous Novel author. In The first scene, seeing him in front of journalists discussing his new book didn't really fit. Apart from those two scenes, the acting was still amazing: later on i read that the script was very exact and that the actors weren't allowed to improvise: but it sure does seem like it. Both played amazingly realistic and very natural. I still think it shouldn't have played in Paris even though it was very nicely put into picture, leaving out all the familiar touristy attractions. But why didn't they choose a not so popular and romance-clichÃ©d city, like Barcelona or something like that.",
488,1 January 2013,imafrombrooklyn,9, Incredible,"This movie, Until Sunset is incredible. The way the characters interact, really makes you feel a connection between the characters and hope they find a way to stay together. The chemistry, conversation (and the background scenery) really creates a magical atmosphere. I enjoyed this much more that the first movie, Until Sunrise. It feels much more ""real"" and the bond between the characters comes through much stronger, more emotional and more authenticly. After watchilng Until Sunset, The first movie Until Sunrise feels really ""blah"" compareed to the intenisity of the Until Sunset. You can feel throughout the movie how the characters are still holding themselves back, and not trusting themselves or the other person to express their true emotions, but through the way they speak and body language, you feel that the strong emotions are right below the surface, yearning to be expressed.",
489,29 May 2005,Avalonbabez,6, 50/50,"if you're into listening to other people's life long conversations, then you might be into this movie, but if you're looking for anything more than a walk around Paris, then I wouldn't even consider watching this film. The characters were very interesting, which might make the story interesting to some people because it's usually the characters that make the story interesting. It doesn't obey by standard romantic drama films. It is simple and the action/conversation is more realistic. But, on the other hand, if you're looking for that standard of romance in which the two engage in a wild ride of romance, you are going to be disappointed because at this point in the story, that happened already...9 years ago. So I suggest renting something more of the standard persuasion.",
490,30 September 2004,jlsedaca,10, wonderful and enchanting,"This is one of the best sequels I have ever seen! Highly recommended. The film was sweet but tense until the very end, and even after that! When we see Jesse and Celine nine years later (it actually is nine years later since Before Sunrise was made) they have changed, and not necessarily for the better. However, sparks still fly and the chemistry that was first seen in Before Sunrise is more alive than ever. The question of whether or not they really did meet one another six months later is answered. The question of whether they belong together will also be answered in this sequel. (as if we didn't know the answer to that from the first film!) Jesse and Celine converse for the whole 81 minutes of the film, which incidentally follows real time. It's amazing how just one day can change your life... watch this film and see.",
491,28 March 2013,emgepe,9, Great Great Great!!!,"I can't say much, the thing is everything in this movie is great! I really enjoy the story and I felt a little sad when the movie ended because I wanted to see more, I wanted to listen to more good conversations, I wanted to see the way Jesse looks at Celine, I wanted to see more...

492,2 November 2004,aimeerae,10, A beautiful conversation,"Watching this movie is like being engrossed in a conversation with a friend you haven't met in a long time, or with someone you've been admiring from afar, or with a really close friend who knows all of your secrets.",
493,13 November 2004,thunggakiran,10, Subtle romance with real facts of love life form the core of the movie,"The writer of the story did a great job. He brought forward several subtle points, facts of life, in a subtle romantic story. In short, the movie captures the essence of love life as most persons live it in this world.",
494,20 July 2006,keckclip,10, can't wait for the next one,"Saw this last night after much anticipation and having always adored the first movie I knew that the sequel wouldn't let me down. I lived in Europe for a large part of my life and when I saw B4 Sunrise back in the 90s I got extremely homesick because that movie really conveyed the European mentality, culture, and lifestyle. The chemistry between Delphy and Hawke was incredible, one almost felt as if one were one of them. The new movie picked up right where the first left off, emotionally speaking. I was as happy to see them get back together as Jesse was at his booksigning. I would say that to me this story is one of, if not, the best romances to have hit the screen since Harry Met Sally. The Dialogue was so natural and spontaneous, I believed every word, nothing about the characters seemed contrived. A true breath of fresh air. Excellent soundtrack too, especially ""The Waltz"" at the end. Excellent all around!",
495,22 November 2004,erin-furnell,9, The chemistry is still there...,"I really enjoyed seeing these two together again. I also enjoyed that the second time around reflects the actual time that has passed since their first rendezvous. Although this film is not as endearing as the original, the two still feed off each other like no time has passed at all. This film is an interesting and sometimes hard-to-swallow parallel of a generations' disappointments yet continuing romanticism. Before Sunrise, the original, was a movie that truly affected me in the same period of my life, 9yrs. past. To see the maturation of these characters, and the inevitable sadness that has grown within these two is sad yet honest. This being said, the genuine trust and goodness of the characters is not seen in many movies anymore. Good flick for a snowy winter's night wrapped in a blanket.",
496,22 November 2005,alahmmed,8, its awesome.,"i actually loved the movie, it was awesome, the point is the movie is so simple, and its not that thing so i cant follow, that what made me like it the most, beside the idea is so nice. enjoy it! the acting was almost real, and the actors both of them, were so simple, that makes ppl think of it as if they were real events, the selection of the places is also good, different locations and a lot of nice areas, and the subjects they were talking about is really a concern of our time, that makes it even more real, to give this movie a word so i can describe it, t has to be AWESOME, lol. for any more notes i have alooot of pictures that am going to post, and some comments on those pics, have fun.",
497,11 January 2005,emailmelala,10, i have a question,"this does not really contain much of a spoiler but since it only pertains to people who saw the movie i don't think it really matters. this might be a little thing, but did u guys notice that the next stop (When they are on the boat ride), the stop where he gets off is called ""henriquatre"" (or Henri 4) and when it turns out he has a kid the kids name is Henry and hes four? Do you think its supposed to be something or not? analogies (sorry wrong word i cant think of a better one for now) comparing having a kid to getting off some sort of ride, or am i over-analyzing it? just a random thing, or not, comments on this? clarifications by the way great movie now I'm going to see the first ( i know i know i never read or see sequels before this one but at the time i could by this and not the other, so oh well i guess). which one is better Sunrise or Sunset?",
498,16 January 2005,guddu-chaudhary,10, A Good wholesome movie for smart & intelligent movie,"Very nice & relaxed movie with talented actors, worth watching,its wholesome in itself, away from thriller & action movies with absurd amount of money and special effects that are in spotlight these days. Full credit to cast, good job. They didn't paint a gloomy picture but most of what the movie was about reality, moreover it wasn't just about two people meeting after a long time and falling in love again but how there perspectives change living apart for so many years. The french girl seemed strikingly smart the way she performed during the whole movie, very intimidating women indeed. I met her during a award ceremony in San Fransico and she is a amazing women. I wish the cast best of luck and success for future.",
499,21 September 2013,Arka243,9, Jesse and Celine meet at Paris nine years after their meeting and spending a night together in Vienna,"Before I get down with the review, I want to specify why I picked the second of the Before trilogies instead of the other two. The first film was made out of a simple and exciting journey of two free, passionate young minds, whereas this film is set into a scenario where both the protagonists are engaged, in fact one of them is married with a kid. So it was relatively more challenging to continue from where the last film left off and maintain the same plot, like they meet, they have a chit- chat until one of them have to leave for a flight. There has been a change in mentality and lifestyle for both of them, and it was necessary for the movie to depict the same, which the director has done incredibly well! The whole film basically revolves around a continuing conversation just like the first film, only this time around the director didn't have plenty of choices for the environment, like a pub, or riverside, or rooftop as it was in the previous version. What amazed me the most is the way the story unfolds, how they initially appear really happy about current life, but as the movie progressed we gradually get to know how they are actually not fully satisfied with their current relations, and how they try to forget that night, but can't...for obvious reasons. There is so much conflict throughout the dialog sequence, that even though it was just two people walking and talking, you never feel awkward, or bored for a moment. Truly an outstanding piece of direction by Richard Linklater.",
500,5 February 2005,patrickmulroy-1,9, A great movie !!,"The one thing that struck me about this movie was that it relied solely on the characters to drive it along. There was no real plot (accept for that of the lurking flight home). However this did not affect the movie at all because the characters were so strong. The two actors, Hawke and Delpy, played the characters magnificently. There was such a real sense of longing to be together, but a knowledge that it could never be. They seemed to have been holding back with each other throughout the film, as if they didn't want to truly share their feelings. ",
501,12 February 2005,rishisw,10, Sunrise and Sunset,"perhaps its the naivety of the characters or where you imagine you were in 1996 or the frame of mind you are in now or what you imagine you were thinking when you were 23. Whatever it is and i think whatever is said in the two movies, aside the job/everyday work stuff it is relevant in your life and even if it isn't, it strikes a chord. Even the ambiguous ending allows you, whatever outlook you have in life, to imagine the ending, yo your outlook on love..whether it is cynical or hopeful.",
502,23 March 2005,pasuljyu,10, The best romance in years....,"This is one of those movies that tend to draw you apart of the idea that there is no way of love in this life... Story is phenomenal... I never saw Before Sunrise, but I enjoyed everything in this one. Hawke and Delpy were both great. You can sense their sorrow and their optimism, but yet you can sense their anger and pain for the years that were between them... I will always remember the scenes: 1)boat ride, where they look almost empty of love but so sincere to each other... 2)the song, Ethan's reaction and her smile... 3)THE END, because it was one of those endings in which you taste love in a way that is in life...",
503,15 April 2005,rbhands,9, Simplistically Original,"First to begin with , I was personally enthralled with the role Ethan Hawke played in the award winning film 'Training Day'.I developed a certain penchant for his character in that very film and his method of acting in general.And so as soon as I heard about this movie (mind you i never heard of the first one in 1995) i immediately got it.

504,24 April 2005,milucha,10," ""Before Sunset""","When I saw ""Before Sunrise"" eight years ago I was overwhelmed for how realistic the dialogs were, for the simplicity/beauty of the shoots .... But the most extraordinary were the actors, they really make the film. And I was already a fan of both. Â…Â… well, I also have to mention the very strong resemblance to something that happened to me that summer Â….",
505,25 April 2005,mail-1437,10," Don't watch this before the prequel ""Before Sunrise"".","Most of the people posting negative comments on this film have admitted to not having seen the prequel, or only having seen it after watching ""Before Sunset"". I first watched ""Before Sunrise"" 6 yrs ago and although forgetting the name of the film and the cast, the story had stuck with me ever since. It was last week I got to see ""Before Sunrise"" again and watched ""Before Sunset"" a week later. I enjoyed ""Before Sunrise"" even more and found the sequel so much better than expected. The skills in writing, directing and acting the story of an ""impossible love"" has never been done with as much perfection as these two films together and Richard Linklater has all of my respect and admiration. This is an incredibly deep, philosophical story about Life and Love, excellently portrayed by Jesse and Celine. It is certainly not a film to everybody's taste, depending on life experience and age, and ten yrs ago I cannot say for certain I would have appreciated these films as much. However to me this film would be the definition of film making as an art form at it's best.",
506,26 April 2005,bosels,9, well worth seeing straight after 'Before Sunrise',"I watched it last night straight after 'Before Sunrise' ... the first time I'd seen either. An excellent movie that celebrates life and love without the Hollywood treatment ... I thought it very real and believable, the characters, the conversations etc. and has been mentioned elsewhere, the obvious chemistry between the two. A refreshing change to see 'intelligent conversation' the centrepoint of a movie ... the desire to get to know another intimately thru questions and answers, and the toing and froing banter between them. I loved the duologue (except for a few crudities them seemed out of place and unnecessary), the observations about the big things and little things of life, and the way conversation flowed so naturally between them. The camera shots gave us plenty of time to observe the nuances in their facial expressions (and appreciate Julie Delpy's beauty). The enthusiastic awkwardness of their initial meeting ... the developing relationship with time as each other's lives are revealed ... very well handled. Hmmm ... think I preferred the first movie even more, for it's novelty etc., but this one was a pearler as well ... well done to all involved for coming up with another great script and performances.",
507,12 May 2005,Millarca,10, We waited for it for so long but it really deserves the wait.,"I loved ""Before sunrise"" when I saw it some years ago, the only bad point in it (for me at least) was that the ending wasn't so clear, you didn't really know what would happen, if they will be together or not afterwards.

508,12 June 2005,luciavolcan,9, courage to change,"A lifetime can be spent wondering how things might have been. Countless dreams go into exploring the alternative possibilities. Eyes meet and wonder flares at the thought of the other's arousal. Why didn't I reach out and grab the brass ring? Am I afraid to critique the life that I live versus the one that got away ? What places would I not know that I treasure now? Where would I have gone that I haven't? Would I have turned out healthier or happier? Would that obscure object of my desire turned out to be a dream or a nightmare? Is it too late to change, or can I plug myself into a new life now? Before Sunset is beautifully thought provoking, if not downright dangerous!",
