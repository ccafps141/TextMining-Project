0,30 October 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," ""Now it looks like Disney Land""","This is one of the best films of the 90's hands down. Without a doubt this has become one of my favorite movies. I'm not sure why really, I just love it. I think because I read the book and a lot of what happened in real life happened in my little town in Chicago. No names, and my old boss who runs our town grocery store actually knew ""Ace"". Again, no names. That was always pretty cool to me, since my town really didn't have much excitement. I guess also because I'm a huge fan of Martin, Robert, and Joe's. When they work together, they create masterpieces. ",/
1,29 December 2021,planktonrules,9," I enjoyed this more than ""Goodfellas"".","I generally avoid violent films...which is why I resisted watching ""Casino"" for a long time. However, despite being very violent in spots, the film turned out to be very compelling....it was far more than just violence and had an interesting look at the mob influence in Las Vegas back in the day.",r
2,22 July 2015,Movie-ManDan,10, I Know I Am In The Minority When I Say This Was Much Better Than Goodfellas.,"I saw Goodfellas first and more times than Casino. Yet, I totally love Casino as it is one of the best movies I have literally ever seen. I find Goodfellas to be overrated and Casino to be the movie that learned from the former's flaws.",e
3,20 February 2000,contronatura,10, The most uncompromising studio picture of the 1990s.,"A complex, multilayered, beautifully directed film, Martin Scorsese's Casino is a masterpiece of destruction and betrayal. Few films take so many chances and succeed so wonderfully. It takes some of the basic formulas that were found in Goodfellas and applies them to another type of story - while Goodfellas' view was ground-level, telling the story of the ""blue collar"" gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. And it's fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control the flow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris, and greed. An amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves in the years to come.",v
4,22 May 2007,Nazi_Fighter_David,8," Robert De Niro, an icon of the contemporary Hollywood crime film...","Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese ""Casino"" is a motion picture about two characters and their chance to rule the desert paradise of Las Vegas We are introduced in with all the lights, the noise, the flashing and the colors of the town that doesn't sleep day or night ",i
5,14 May 2003,FilmOtaku,8, Typically fantastic Scorcese film,"I have to admit my bias, because I believe that Scorcese cannot do wrong - ever.  Even his lesser-known or critically panned films are above the ""great film"" line, and Casino is certainly no exception. ",e
6,3 April 2005,The_Void,7," Entertaining, but it lacks bite and emotion","Martin Scorsese's Casino has all the ingredients for a great crime film. It's got hits, bad language, Robert DeNiro, gambling, lots of Italian Americans - it's all there. Furthermore, it's got a great soundtrack, the Las Vegas setting makes for a great location and the acting is largely very good...but somehow, this just isn't a great film. Scorsese has missed the mark thanks to a lack of emotion. There is no reason to care for the characters in this movie, and that makes the film hard to connect with on the whole. The movie also follows the common Scorsese format, in that some guy gets rich and respected, then something bad happens and he finds himself back where he started. In fact, the ending of this movie is only an ""I'm a schmo"" away from being a complete copy of Goodfellas. Still, at least the movie manages to stay interesting for most of it's runtime, and it's easy to forgive the flaws when you're watching Joe Pesci threatening someone who's head he's jammed into a vice.",w
7,28 October 2000,famsmith,10, An underrated and undervalued Scorsese Classic,"If you haven't seen Casino yet, stop whatever it is you're doing, rush to the nearest video store, rent it, and watch it.  Along with Mean Streets Casino is probably Scorsese's most underrated and unheralded picture.  I would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film. The film deals with a particular time period and a particular atmosphere and accomplishes an overwhelming achievement by creating and accurately portraying both.  The art direction is splendid, most likely the best of any film Scorsese has ever done.  The acting is superb.  I never thought Pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in Raging Bull until I saw Casino.  Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again.  This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in.  Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch alot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold.  Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker.  Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career.  Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it.  This film is truly a gem.",/
8,16 August 2005,ray-280,10, A Can't-Miss Story No Matter How Told,"As a lifelong gambler who has crossed paths with a few fringe types portrayed in the film, I'm well aware of the story, the culture, and the ambiance of the Tangiers, the fictional casino placed in the control of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert Deniro). Rothstein is not a mob member, but a ""moneymaker"" for them because he's the nation's best sports handicapper. It was refreshing for a movie to finally show that not all gamblers are stupid, but instead one of those who takes advantage of the many who are.",r
9,28 September 2010,kenjha,6, Narrated for the Blind,"Fueled by mob bosses, two long-time friends make it big in Las Vegas. Scorsese not only rehashes the themes he explored in ""Goodfellas,"" but is also much too long-winded about it. After the film starts with heavily narrated expository scenes, one would expect the main story to kick in, but it continues in the same vein. This must be the most heavily narrated film in history, defying the notion that film is mainly a visual medium. Adding to the busy soundtrack is a non-stop hit parade of 1970s songs. Of course there are numerous scenes showcasing Scorsese's obsession with repulsive violence. De Niro and Pesci essentially reprise their ""Goodfellas"" roles. Stone is alluring.",w
10,17 June 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, Hugely underrated and very compelling film,"I don't consider Casino Scorsese's very best film(Goodfellas is my personal favourite), but it is a fantastic film and definitely one to see. It is shocking, disturbing and unflinching in places, particularly the part where a head gets squeezed in a vice, but that added to the atmosphere rather than distracted from it.",4

Even Sharon Stone is good in this brilliant film,3

13,26 June 2005,BrandtSponseller,8, Very good but not without flaws,"Casino is a very good film. If you're at all interested in gangster/mafia films, or if you're at all a fan of director/co-writer Martin Scorsese, novelist/co-writer Nicholas Pileggi, or actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods, then Casino is without a doubt a must-see. I'm a huge De Niro fan, and I'm a fan of Scorsese and Woods as well. I certainly enjoyed the film.",2
14,5 August 2005,bkoganbing,10, How Others See Us,"Casino is my favorite movie of the last decade of the last century. Just like in Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese rivets the audience to their seats without a real hero to root for. It's the power of the characters he creates.",0
15,26 November 2012,TheUnknown837-1,5," Even though the technique is pure, the storytelling seems half-baked and uninterested in itself.","The opening 30 minutes or so of ""Casino"" embodies everything that I adore about pre-21st century Martin Scorsese cinema, most particularly the excellent craftsmanship he seems to have lost his grip in on recent years. As the picture begins, we get this fabulous quasi-documentary narrative with Robert De Niro, as the film's protagonist—nobody with any sense of morality can call a mob figure a hero—providing us all the details. What he's been given to say is fascinating, and the way Scorsese coordinates his camera is superb. The technique is pure, the edits are crisp and clean (there are none of those horrendous, in-your-face jump cuts that stabbed his 2006 film ""The Departed"" clean through the heart), and the amount of detailed information presented in an entertaining way. Scorsese and his co-screenwriter, Nicolas Pileggi, both of whom collaborated on the 1990 gangster masterpiece ""GoodFellas,"" are certainly to be commended as researchers. In this fabulous first half-hour, they know just when and where to tell us data about how the mob ran a Las Vegas casino and when to show us. They tell us who watches who during a big gambling night, and show us, in splendid detail, how to get rid of a cardsharp by giving him a bogus heart attack.",4
16,3 October 2020,Xstal,7, 7-7-7-7,"Nothing you haven't seen before, Robert De Niro performs in a similar style to several he established his career playing and Joe Pesci can only play himself no matter what the role calls for. If organised crime capers are your thing, or you're a casino denizen, it's lucky 7s all round for you, although, on this occasion, it's complemented and elevated through an outstanding performance by Sharon Stone. She steals the picture as the addicted to anything femme fatale opportunist most men would aspire to tame and, if they did get that chance, they would soon discover the trophy wife from hell - Sam did, but don't let that put you off.",1
17,10 March 2008,jpschapira,9, The Scorsese spell...,"During its first forty minutes, Martin Scorsese's ""Casino"" is pure narration, except for little spoken moments. It's a risky move, but then Marty has always been risky, and this movie may be the ultimate example to prove it. Closing in at three hours duration time, it takes its characters on a roller-coaster ride that not everyone might appreciate; from the advantages of recurrent fortune to the regular Scorsese tragedy.That's cutting it short, because there's a lot in the middle, but without telling you 'what' exactly goes on in ""Casino"", I'll tell you how you can approach it as a film. ",/
18,27 April 2007,CuriosityKilledShawn,9, Is it just me...,"...or is this the darkest black comedy ever made? I just find Casino so amusing and funny that I hardly even notice the grim violence and harrowing drama. I also think that Casino is far, far superior to the over-rated Goodfellas. Even though it's longer, it passes in a breeze. Casino is just so colorful, multi-layered and intricate despite it's apparent simplicity. The film has three different characters narrating the story but none of it feels like exposition and it's never over-bearing.",?
19,12 February 2022,jadavix,9, Another Scorsese classic,"While re-watching ""Casino"" just now I kept thinking of Spielberg's words re: Kubrick. ""Just try to stop watching one of Stanley's movies when you've already started,"" he said. ""It's impossible"".",r
20,20 September 1999,dover,8," Very Good, not great","Taken alone, this was an excellent movie, very watchable, if a bit long. However, a lot of this movie obviously plays very close to what some of the people involved in it have played before.  De Niro's character is eerily similar to Al Pacino's in ""The Godfather II"", and Joe Pesci could easily be playing himself in ""Goodfellas"".  This is another solid effort from Scorcese and crew, but it lacks originality.",e

22,2 February 2022,Cinemaniac1984,10, A captivating and brilliant movie with an all star cast that I still cherish to this day.,"I still remember watching Casino as a 12 year old on New Year's Day back in 1997 and being captivated from start to finish. I was lucky to be watching Casino at that age considering that the film is rated R 18+ in Australia for Medium Level Violence and Medium Level Coarse Language. Thankfully my Dad was lenient as long as we were sensible as myself, my Dad and my brother sat together and watched the movie. Casino was and still is a brilliant movie. Martin Scorsese directed another top notch film. The all star cast was perfect. Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese mark another collaboration after their success with the classics Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver (1976), New York, New York (1977), The King of Comedy (1983), and Cape Fear (1991). Also joining in the collaboration is Joe Pesci of whom the three actors united for Raging Bull (1980), Goodfellas (1990) and The Irishman (2019).",_
23,1 July 2005,hall895,6, GoodFellas in Vegas...it was better in New York,"Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci team up again for a GoodFellas rehash. Casino is not a bad film. But it pales in comparison to what has come before it. It would be much easier to applaud Casino if we could take it on its own merits. But the parallels to GoodFellas are so numerous and so obvious, Casino always leaves us wanting more. We've seen this all before and we've seen it done better.",=

Although not a remake in the traditional sense, ""Casino"" is a virtual re-presentation of Martin Scorcese's '91 smash ""Goodfellas"". Now that was a great gangster film.

28,8 February 2006,Sylviastel,10, I don't care how long it takes. Put an equal amount in each muffin.,"I love Casino especially if I watch it from the beginning. Robert DeNiro should have won an Academy AWard for this performance along with Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone. The film is perfectly entertaining about casinos before it became Disneyland. There were other great performances by Don Rickles, Alan King, etc. The film is a Martin Scorsese film with two of his favorite actors--Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci giving Oscar performances. The script was fresh and entertaining. I also have to say that James Woods' performance as Ginger's pimp was worthy of being nominated for best supporting actor. THis film has several fabulous scenes and moments. By the end, you really don't want it to end because it's that good. I love how Ace and Nicky (Joe Pesci's character) narrate and explain the on-going activities between the Las Vegas Casino and it's connection to Kansas City, Missouri. I really enjoy watching the scenes of Ace being in control and the corruption that occurs. But it's that kind of film. You know what happens but you enjoy the ride anyway and I do enjoy this film. I always look forward to seeing it on the cable stations. Of course, Ace and Nicky's friendship is the crutch of this film.",r

30,23 February 2000,Quinoa1984,10," ""Hey, better here than, uh, up there, y'know what I mean?""","Casino shows that GoodFellas, the milieu if not the overall tenor as this is more of a full-blown epic in Las Vegas can still be well done when people like Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi do it right.",
31,18 December 1998,RogueXVI,10, I never knew Sharon Stone was so talented,"What a fantastic movie, thanks to its cast, top heavy with stars and fine direction of the ""Oscar begging"" Martin Scorsese. Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci are great, as always, together. But, surprisingly, it's Sharon Stone that comes of with all the acting credit, she simply effervesces as the gold digging casino hustler. After witnessing her performance myself I couldn't agree more, and think she deserves a place above Susan Sarandon who ""stole"" the Academy Award from under Sharon's nose.  The photography is phenomenal and combined with great acting is a recipe for a classy film.  However occasional brilliant sequences, are often marred by the continuous commentary, which prevents any real, deep, emotional involvement with any of the characters.  Great stuff, just slightly flawed.9/10.",
32,10 January 2001,mm-39,8, The more I see the more I like it,"This film grows on the viewer, the first time I saw this film it reminded me of Goodfellas too much.  After, seeing the video a few times, I belong to a movie club, the movie rates as a classic.  Long movies usually become boring, however this story is easy to follow.  It is directed well, and acted well.  I read the book, and the film follows it closely, a few events changed because of time considerations and where shorting.  The film had to be long for it to reasonbly follow the book.  This is a interesting story, and the movie follows it accurately, and the viewer goes along the journey as he was there. My opinion when you feel this the movie is very good one.",
33,22 January 2005,optimism_always,10, Brilliant acting. Superb story based on events that happened in real life.,"Martin Scorcese's harsh and yet delicately balanced masterpiece rises above anything petty meaning that if one wishes and has the ability and means to create a Sicilian mafia movie he should do so with grandeur and put into it as much effort as possible for people remember those who take advantage of their talent and circumstances and are diligent in their undertakings. Casino is in my opinion an epic, but it's much more than that. This film speaks even to those who dislike the subject of organized crime. You have to be objective when judging this movie and those of us who criticize everything that stands out amongst the grey background of that which is mediocre are fools who envy others' accomplishments and view them as insults to their own personal uselessness. Casino is one of the best movies of the 90's. In fact, in my opinion, it's one of the best organized crime movies of all time. Its moral is that no matter how tough you think you are there's always someone you answer to and that you ultimately will, indeed, if you screw things up.",
34,5 March 2022,bosimmons-44782,10, One of my favorite movies of all time,"This is one if my favorite movies ever. The three hours just fly by for me. This movie also has a special place in my life because Sharon Stone reminds me of my mom in this movie. Every single person who knows my mom and has seen this movie says that about her even my dad and it weirds us out because she is nothing like that but we love it because of that. Anyway, this movie is great. Good story telling, good camera work, great acting. I prefer it to goodfellas just because its mainly Robert being the star.",

Despite sweeping cinematography and palpable evil at nearly every plot-turn, ""Casino"" seems a ""Goodfellas"" retread. Robert De Niro is predictably good in the lead, but Joe Pesci, as De Niro's surly back-up, does nothing new and Sharon Stone, as De Niro's wife, is just the 'token woman', trying to build a character without much genuine material to work with (she's satisfactory). Director Martin Scorsese seems more interested in his characters' actions than their motivations, causing some confusion in the story and leaving many questions unanswered by the end. The film is fast-paced and entertaining, but it doesn't leave a heady imprint behind, and some of the violence verges on self-parody. **1/2 from ****",

45,19 July 2022,gbill-74877,5," Seriously overrated, dreadfully bloated","Quality production value and a fine cast, but too bloated and too violent. Scorsese is revered as a filmmaker but personally I have a problem with how he revels in and glamorizes violence, and there are several scenes of sadistic cruelty here. His protagonists (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci) are full of toxic masculinity and while they pay in the story line for their choices, there is also a degree of admiration for them on display, and no real examination of the impact of their violence on others. They are men among men who know the score, know how the corrupt system works and are just better at playing it than others. The annoying soundtrack and overused narration just amplify this. I liked the arc of the relationship between these old friends who gradually become enemies and found Pesci's profanity (and accent) funny even though it wasn't meant to be, but the interminable melodrama with the wife (Sharon Stone) and all her ridiculousness (tying her daughter to a bed, snorting coke in front of her daughter, etc) dragged the film out far too long.

Instead, we even have narration as gangsters are shooting each other. Sharon Stone stole he show and she deserved to get the Oscar for Best Actress. Too bad she didn't. I don't know what more an actress could do. The film was full of great moments - Peschi for all intents and purposes reprized his role as Tommy from Goodfellas and was as menacing as ever, though it mystifies me as how anyone could be intimidated by this dwarf. It's almost as bad as when Danny DeVito played the tough guy in ""Hoffa"".But look out - when Peschi goes after a guy with a ballpoint pen, all bets are off - I mean, we're not in Kansas anymore...harrowing.

So, clearly, I held off seeing Casino for many years. The other day it was at Half Price for a dollar so I picked it up. I always enjoy stories about Vegas; it's fun to peek behind the scenes of the casinos. This was one of the last good roles DeNiro had, before he descended into the Valhalla of romantic comedies with the likes of Ben Stiller. The good is simply the story itself, which is essentially true. (It is certainly NOT true that the mob was not skimming in Vegas until the 1970's). DeNiro was good, especially when he tried to deal with an old friend who he realized and always knew was an out of control idiot. DeN was clearly ready to jettison Pesci if that was what it took to keep the casino running, but was afraid he could not do so because Pesci was a made man and DeNiro, a Jew, was not and never could be. The scenes ""back East"" with the big boys were always well done; good supporting jobs by all involved. Don Rickles was good. The bad, aside from Pesci and Stone, were: the soundtrack; I felt it got in the way because it was continuous, too loud, and often at odds with the tone of what was showing on the screen. The lighting; in many scenes Scorsese put a hot spotlight on a character or a desktop. I just can't figure out what he was trying to do. The running narration was not needed after the first few scenes. All in all, I'd recommend it.

There's the obvious, such as Pileggi writing the novels behind both, and some of the same cast. Beyond that, though, the story-telling(such as the frequent and effective use of voice-over monologues, and multiple narrators, I could go on) and overall flavor are similar. And why not? It fits for one as well as the other and they're well-done and not the exact same film(having watched one does not mean you've already seen the other, I'll put it that way). The plot is engaging and interesting throughout. Characters are credible, well-developed and consistent. The acting is excellent, for everyone involved(including the kids). DeNiro and Pesci nail their roles, Stone gives what may be the most powerful performance of her career, and Woods is spot-on as always when given appropriate material. The dialog is impeccable, with countless memorable and well-delivered lines. Cinematography and editing are marvelous. The music is great, the score well-composed, and they are used expertly throughout this. This has constant strong language, plenty of brutal, bloody violence, disturbing content and a bit of sexuality. The DVD holds deleted scenes(among them an outtake or two) and six featurettes, four of which are on this site, and that I will review individually, the last two being a documentary called Vegas and the Mob and an episode of a History Channel show entitled True Crime Authors, both of them well worth the time.

I do find the movie an entertaining three hours, but there ends up feeling like there's little point in the end. The rise and fall of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein and the rise and fall of mob controlled Las Vegas end up feeling disconnected to me, like they happened coincidentally rather than one feeding the other.

Taking place in the early 1980s, two mob friends, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, are put in charge of a Las Vegas casino. Their job? To make certain everything runs smooth and to make sure that the bosses get their black bag of money. What happens? To put it into a short context: things start to fall apart. The dysfunction represented in this movie is amazing, every little thing leads to something worse. The beginning shows the rise of the Mafia's empire in Las Vegas: from the towering casinos to the floors of the casino, you get a little taste of everything in here. What's really interesting is that if you played by the rules, they treated you like gold, but if you double crossed them things could get pretty ugly (see the hammer scene). Casino, put simply, is a great movie. The only problem I experienced was that there were parts that seemed to drag out. The movie weighs in at a hefty 2hrs and 59min so don't expect to go anywhere soon. If you haven't see this yet then give it a chance, it really is a great movie.",

You should be able to convey your story through images and character dialogue, not a constant narration with little clips of what they're talking about scattered throughout.

Sam has also fallen for blonde bombshell Ginger (Sharon Stone), a gold-digging hustler.

Funny at first, with his ""F""ing vocabulary, Nicky soon starts to grate on the nerves. Quick, bring out the baseball bats. Sharon Stone does a respectable job as Ginger, but a Golden Globe win over Susan Sarandon (not to mention the ignored Kathy Bates) is a bit tough to swallow.

Casino is no exception. I'm kind of surprised that no one seems to have seen this movie. I guess it's just overshadowed by other Scorcese's films with greater hype such as Goodfellas or Taxi Driver.,

The thing that I remember most vividly from seeing it that last time is being thoroughly upset by the scene in the cornfield at the end of the film. Most of the rest of the movie was overshadowed by the memory of that one scene, so I wanted to watch it again because I love Scorsese's films so much that not knowing about Casino was just acceptable. So I watched it again and I loved it again and my respect and amazement at the quality of the movie and the acting and the story and everything else was renewed, and nothing was that bad during the whole movie, so when the cornfield scene was coming up I thought, come on, there's only maybe 8 minutes left in the movie, how bad could this scene really be? Still, my heart was pounding in my chest. It was bad, man. It was real bad.",

All of his hallmarks are here in spades as he weaves his epic and vividly detailed saga of organized crime in Las Vegas. Much of the style here is over-the-top, and when you combine that with three brand-name movie stars (DeNiro almost hilariously subdued here, Sharon Stone at the pinnacle of her appeal and showing an amazing range here as DeNiro's gold digging drug addicted wife, and an insane Joe Pesci doing a gonzo take on an insane Joe Pesci) acting to within inches of their lives, you get a wildly entertaining albeit over long three hour ride. Toss in some scenery chewing from Don Rickles, James Woods, and that hilarious Italian grandmother (Scorsese's real life mother) in the butcher shop, and you can't lose. However, when the central conceit of the movie is to explore the criminal underbelly of a city that legally peddles crime and sleaze as entertainment, ""Casino"" ultimately seems a bit redundant.",

Add that with the clever and dramatic visuals using camera trickery, you get the astonishing look at the crime scenes. Particularly, the scene where the con artist gets his hand smashed is really neatly done.It's actually simple trick using camera angle and mock props, but the movie used it in a sudden way that is guaranteed to pull your eyes to the screen.

I don't care if Martin Scorsese directed it. Even monkeys fall out of trees. Why would a cartel of rich men hand over control of a casino to a handicapper, i.e. someone who is good at betting. You need someone who is good at organisation and leadership, a CEO. Any rich man would know that. If he didn't know that, he wouldn't be rich. So the premise, introduced in the first minute, makes no sense. Joe Pesci's yapping voice - as a narrator?! Some silly staged stabbing in a bar over a pen. The other man's hostility didn't even make sense. Just a lazy set up to show how vicious the Joe Pesci character was.

At three hours, the picture loses some of it's edge, even with Pesci's manic and over the top characterization of Nicky Santoro, a mob hit man sent to Vegas to keep an eye on Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (De Niro) as the boss of the new Tangiers Hotel.

It's not as intriguing as Goodfellas was when I was rooting against the lead characters, and not as interesting and complex as the storyline of The Godfather. Even in comparison with the over-the-top Scarface, it lacks real value and true substance. Some scenes with Joe Pesci are memorable, but the rest of the movie seems like a waste of space. Scorsese's career revolved around mobster movies, and this was just too slow of a movie.

It made little sense to me at the end. You don't really know what happened to the main character's (Robert DeNero) wife and kid. I am not that huge of fan of Sharon Stone but besides that I really can't fathom why she was nominated for an Oscar for this. Joe Pesci pretty much plays the exact same short tempered jerk that he plays in Goodfellas. Only this time he is his own boss. It was so long too. I liked how The Simpsons parodied the scene in this movie where Robert DeNero has a guy's hand hit with a hammer. That scene isn't that great either. I also didn't care for the amount of cussing in this movie. It had 422 uses of the Fword. Which is a record. Almost every single line in this movie used the Fword. I know Goodfellas used the Fword but not nearly as much as this movie did. Overall this movie was boring and I didn't really like any of the characters.,

Now, some may not care for it simply because it's just not their cup of tea, but nonetheless it's still a great film. The writing is really perfect for the kind of film it is. A record of the most F bombs ever spoken in a film was set by Casino, before Wolf of Wall Street came along that is. I would probably say the 400+ F bombs used was overkill if it would have been a different kind of film, but it fit perfectly for this kind. The writing definitely fits the characters. The characters are wonderfully deep too, we learn so much about them and we get to see them played by such great actors. Pesci, De Niro, and Stone all turn in marvelous performances, especially Stone (this was her Academy Award nomination). The story is very interesting and you won't be bothered by the somewhat long runtime because of the good pacing and the level of interest. There is just so much happening with these interesting, very damaged characters that you won't wanna turn away, I sure didn't.

140,3 August 2019,dreamingescapist,8, All Bets Are In.,"'Casino' is probably the last of the real epic mob dramas. Martin Scorsese's stylish tale of power, greed, and deception is based on real-life organized crime associate, Lefty Rosenthal. The screenplay is penned by Scorsese and his collaborator from 'Goodfellas', Nicholas Pileggi. The movie is three hours long, and it might feel like it drags on places, but the writing is perfect. And what fantastic performances by the actors. The main cast (Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, James Woods, Don Rickles, and Sharon Stone in one of her best roles) is supported by magnificent mob movie heavyweights like Vinny Vella and Frank Vincent. Nearly half of the movie is told through narrations that are quite descriptive, so it almost feels like you are watching (listening) visual audiobook. But the narrations are spot on and contains some of the best lines from the movie. Especially the ones from Joe Pesci whose narration is so smooth and calm compared to his hot-tempered character Nicky Santoro.",
141,16 January 2011,Scarecrow-88,7, Casino,"Gargantuan epic(some critics and Scorsese fans considered it his ""failed epic"")about mob-run Las Vegas focusing on casino ""boss"" De Niro, his flashy junkie wife Sharon Stone, and volatile ""muscle"", Joe Pesci, how they had it all and squandered it due to their own faults and frailties. De Niro, without a legal license to run a casino, was able to run operations of a specific casino successfully with help from city commissioners, and, most importantly, major Midwest mobsters who skimmed from the ""counting room"" in order to allow him his opportunity to earn lots of money and live a life of luxury. Pesci was the mob's go-to-guy when they needed people whacked or kept in line, anyone who threatened to take from the mobsters what they considered theirs. Pesci is feared, but unstable and ill-tempered, and soon his presence in Las Vegas wasn't wanted, his criminal activities catching the attention of the police and FBI out to put him behind bars. Sharon Stone is alluring and attractive to De Niro, but she's involved with a lowlife pimp(played by James Woods)and unable to let him go. Stone has the looks and personality that benefits De Niro, helping him bring in the right kind of people to profit from in his casino. But her drug habits and alcoholism(not to mention, her inability to relinquish her love for Woods who is manipulating her to give him money behind De Niro's back)slowly over time ruin the marriage and this deterioration places her in the arms of Pesci! Scorsese's film is, as you'd expect, very detailed and the screenplay quite elaborate in the inner-working of the criminal enterprise ran by the mob who used wiseguys as their eyes and ears in Las Vegas. We see how De Niro and Pesci's personalities bring about their downfall, and Stone's addictions lead to a tragic conclusion. With all the money, clothes, and jewelry, Stone couldn't find happiness, agonizing in a joyless marriage to a man she never loved to start with. De Niro, as much as he was skilled at making money for his mobsters, couldn't help himself when it came to Stone and running such an efficient casino that he couldn't appease the city commissioner to allow his dumb-as-dirt brother-in-law(Joe Bob Briggs, inspired casting)a small position. Pesci's explosive, corrosive temperament, and unwillingness to play by the rules when it come to behaving in casinos, meant that he was doomed to eventually be discarded by his superiors. As was the case in GOODFELLAS, CASINO has startling scenes of brutal violence as the FBI get the pinch on a stupid mobster goon who gave up the names and subject matter of his people with the old-time gangsters setting in motion the executions of anyone who might rat them out. Watching the glamorous Stone unravel by film's end is disheartening and rather pitiable, going from elegant and stunning to washed-out and browbeaten, the drugs and booze turning her into a hobbling, malevolent, blabbering misfit. We see Pesci stab a man with a pen for cursing De Niro, shoot a woman while eating her supper, and bash poor Don Rickles across the face and skull with a telephone..it's not surprising what his character's outcome is. De Niro, though, because he's such a money-making machine, might escape a grim fate, although Scorsese opens the film with him in a car that blows up. Scorsese leans heavily on voice over narration from both De Niro and Pesci who explain the ways things were run in Las Vegas before the corporations took over. Clocking in at 3 hours, CASINO is certainly long-winded, and I'm not sure these are the kind of characters one wants to spend this amount of time with, but I found the story Scorsese brings to light compelling enough to withstand the entire journey.",

143,2 October 2020,TheHonestCritic,2," Martin Scorsese has done it again! The keyword in this case, is ""again"".....","""Casino"" (1995), here we have an example of a dysfunctional ""film"" written and directed by a very lazy film maker, known as Martin Scorsese. This ""movie"" is a painful example of being way too pedestrian. What that means, is that the film makers behind redundant types of films are afraid to step out of their comfort zones and try something different. ""Casino"" is the exact same thing as the other diarrhea stain, known as ""Goodfellas"" (1990). It's the exact same plot, except it takes place in Las Vegas instead of New York City. Granted, ""Goodfellas"" is not a total disaster though. It does have a couple of redeeming qualities. But overall, it was nothing but pure disappointment. ""Casino"" suffers the same problems as ""Goodfellas"", just ten times worse! It has a dull and predictable story, abysmal acting, cheap special effects, and a dull generic soundtrack. This story was doomed from the start, it was co-written by Nicholas Pileggi, who also co-wrote the script for ""Goodfellas"". You would think that Martin Scorsese would have learned his lesson and kept his hands off screenplay duties! He should have just stuck to directing, but that's beside the point. ""Casino"" is yet another gangster film with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci as two of the main characters. We'll go into more details with them later. One of the biggest issues with this ""film"" is the constant bombardment of narration. As I mentioned, showing instead of telling usually conveys a stronger impact. This is supposed to be a ""movie"", not an audiobook! In one scene, where the actions of a casino are being described in detail, it just makes this ""film"" seem more like a boring documentary than a legible piece of cinema. Seriously, every time there was any narration during the ""movie"", I shouted: ""just shut up!"" Narration is supposed to enhance the story behind the film, not be a distraction. Another big problem, is the excessive violence. You're probably thinking: ""what?"" Yes, violence in movies and TV shows usually does not bother me. But, in the rare case of this ""film"", they went way above and beyond. It was past the point of redundant. I mean, good God! I don't mind a violent movie well-told with a great story. But, any violence has to be earned and warranted. I honestly think some of these fights were added in to pad out the runtime. Isn't 178 minutes long enough?! The plot in this ""film"" is the same exact thing as ""Goodfellas"", only on steroids. How original! Now for the acting, it ranges from bad, to just plain abysmal. The best of the bad are Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. But, the problem is, we've seen them before in other Martin Scorsese films! What? He couldn't find any other actors to be in this crappy movie? He must really treat those two like royalty to keep them coming back to work for him! Sharon Stone gives a terrible performance, seasoned with cliched filth. In the case of this ""movie"", her nickname should really be Sharon Stoned. Her character just looks bored and high as a kite throughout the ""film"". Hey, if I was involved with this ""movie"", I'd be bored too, but I would never do drugs! Bear in mind, Sharon Stone is not a terrible actress overall. She has acted well in other movies and shows. So, what's her excuse here? The other actors and actresses just fall flat, as a result of redundancy and bad chemistry from the other horrible acting performances. As for the special effects, most of them were actually not too bad. However, there were some, particularly a lot of the gun and blood effects get a little cheesy. Plus, you can tell at multiple points that the baseball bats during the death scene in the cornfield are just made out of rubber. Also, Joe Pesci's character buried in the ground is obviously an animatronic robot. Finally, the soundtrack is a total joke. It's one of the most boring and poorly arranged film scores I've heard. Once again, it sounds like it was rushed together at the last minute. Film Making 101: when you notice the edits on-screen, or notice it in the audio, then something is very wrong. Editing is supposed to be completely seamless and unnoticed by the viewer at all! Now for the only miraculous positive, which is the sets/locations. Casinos always create a nice atmosphere and of course Las Vegas is a fun place to film a movie! Bottom line, Martin Scorsese's biggest issue is that he's afraid to step out of his comfort zone with his films. I haven't seen all of his movies. But, ""Casino"" is, in my opinion, his absolute worst film! It is nothing short of a pile of garbage. I'm giving this ""film"" 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you're ever looking to watch a great gangster, drama film, or any other movie for that matter, I strongly suggest that you find one without Martin Scorsese's involvement!",

The story, the camera shots, the settings, dialog, montages, characters, acting, the soundtrack and references to real life. This is Martian Scorsese at his finest. You see the rise and fall of each of the main characters, how it starts psychologically effecting each of them. In my opinion this movie has the best personalities aside from sifi movies, each character is greedy but they get the things they want in different ways than the others. This movie is perfectly paced. I cannot think or find anything I don't like with this movie. If your a movie head than checkout this movie, a seriously underrated movie",

I wanted to be this ""Ace"", this manager whose infallible competence in gambling, betting and defining odds made it sound like an exact science.

Such is a theme that acclaimed director Martin Scorsese has returned to time and time again: demonstrating the pros and cons of a life lived on the other side of the law. And while Scorsese's mob classic Goodfellas charted the rise of a lowly hood through the ranks of the mob, Casino details the contrary: a life of luxury at the top of the mob, the consumption of man's soul by greed, betrayal and maddening violence, and the inevitable plummet which ensues.

Casiso is a rollicking, rock and roll ride through the world of Las Vegas, brilliantly set against the sounds and colours of two decades. The effortless way Scorcese pulls this off (he uses a 1930s-style font for captions, and at times the strip appears as if drawn in pastels) is perhaps his last great cinematic achievement. But it's not quite a great film, too long for its length, too similar to his earlier 'Goodfellas', and, for all its horrific violence, just a little too smooth. The audience of 'Raging Bull' was allowed to feel what it was like to be Jake La Motta, at least as Scorcese imagined it. The audience of 'Casino' is merely told, the double-headed voice-over steering us through a story we are shown, but never allowed wholly inside of. Still, the abruptly unsentimental ending reminds us of the ruthless that all great directors must possess; and sadly, it's not a edge Scorcese seems to possess any more.",

Deniro and Pesci, reteamed again, share the narration. Here's another true mafia related tale, about the corrupt vices behind a casino, where it's new boss, Sam Rothstein, (a more gentler soul to Deniro's semi frightening Jimmy Gent in Goodfellas) has a close call with death, via a car explosion, where too the Ace as he was known, survives many interrogations, and some terrifying moments of paranoia, not knowing if he was going to be the next body dropped in the desert. We see him take continual hounding by the FBI, but the Ace always managed to beat him. Of course, Deniro's faultless, his mate, mafia cowboy Nicky Santoro, (Joe Pesci, solid) bares some similarities to the incredibly frightening Tommy in Goodfellas, though I know who I'd pick, if I having to choose a room alone. Stone is at her shining moment, playing the junkie pro Ginger, who became Mrs Sam Rothstein, despite having to a constantly cling on to a scuzzy low life pimp, Lester, (Woods in one of his best performances) who maintained this sort of hold on her. Again there are violent moments that shock, one as excessively illustrated by the big boys upstairs, to players who rig games, another one involving insult, plus Pesci's foul mouthed antics, and womanizing, even doing Stone. Even more enjoyable than Goodfellas, it's running time had me worried, stretched out to nearly three hours. Casino, sort of has an excess feel to it, judging by some themes, that have us questioning if they were true, but again it's just another engrossing Scorsese hit.

It reunited director Martin Scorsese, writer Nicholas Pileggi and actors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci from Goodfellas. The obvious similarities between the films were used negatively against it. It was essentially seen as a lesser re-run of that earlier film. Well, I guess critics need to say things like this to indicate they know what they're talking about but for the rest of us such details are sort of irrelevant and we are only really interested in whether Casino was any good on its own right. And the answer is that it sure is. Maybe not of the standard of Goodfellas but it sure is in a similar ball-park. Like that earlier film it's based on real events, although in this case even more characters have been re-named, probably for legal reasons. It's a rise and fall crime film about the workings of a 70's Las Vegas casino, in which the Mafia skimmed millions of dollars.",

I admit I am not a fan of the genre, having watched 20 minutes of one of the Godfathers and less than that of The Sopranos. The characters are cardboard, overly romanticized, embarrassingly conforming to what someone thinks the stereotype is, and the dialogue is pitiful. Scorcese ought to try making a real movie instead of recycling this gangster swill. Mean Streets is the only thing of his I've sat through because it was gritty and real. Everything since - hogwash.

DeNiro plays a well-meaning odds-maker who is placed in charge of a casino, while Pesci acts in a perfect role as DeNiro's protective but jealous keeper.  Sharon Stone turns in the role of a lifetime as the mentally-instable, paranoid, and jealous (ex-hooker) wife of Stone (DeNiro's character).  The movie comes to a head in a frenetic battle between DeNiro and Stone, and the results are delicious.

178,12 January 2006,joelparkjools,10, Critics have issues,"OK where do i begin, i'm flabbergasted! that Casino doesn't get the attention it deserves. Most critics will say ooo it's just a rehash of Mean Streets and Goodfellas. The film has similarities yes, he uses the same actors playing similar characters yes, but don't you think Scorsese realizes this, don't you think he casted them for this very reason! He not only uses the same actors, he uses the same songs on occasion, he even repeats shots, but in order to give the shot a different meaning. For me Casino is the third and probably final installment of his mob trilogy. With each film he climbs higher up the ranks! Mean Streets starts with local hoods, Goodfellas to the more organized gangsters and Casino to the very top of the chain. I think Casino is probably the finest out of the three, it is certainly the best to look at. The cinematography and use of sound in particular are almost unparalleled. He even uses music from Jean-Luc Godard's Le Mepris, which contrasts the two relationships that are falling apart. Do you really think Casino is just an overlong sequel, do you really think Scorsese would stoop that low. The editing alone is probably the best of his career. Critics are always afraid to pride new films over the classics (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull). Now they are great films don't get me wrong, but i believe Casino deserves to be up there with them, more so than Goodfellas. Some critics have gone on to the say the film fizzles out after the first act? What film were they watching, do they know nothing about narrative pacing. If the film were to continue the pace of the first act i think the majority of the audience would have heart attacks, if they don't anyway. Now get this, it's from the Rolling Stone review. OK, 'What trips up Casino is its straining toward art'. So what exactly do they think Scorsese should be straining for, it doesn't sound like they need a great deal of straining for their reviews. It's little comments like this that really get under my skin. OO Casino's too long, if you think you can put across that much information in a shorter time then you're welcome. OK, that's enough for one night, Casino is an epic gangster masterpiece. A landmark of the 90s. It's not Goodfellas no, in my opinion it's better.

192,25 February 2006,titanrd1,9, A Masterpiece,"One of Scorsese's best films and one of the best films of the 90's; ""Casino"" in a no-holds-barred criminal drama that never ceases to entertain while at the same time, telling an extremely intriguing story. I'm not a big fan on gangster/mafia films (only a few exceptions), but this transcends my personal biases. The acting is phenomenal. De Niro, Stone and Pesci are perfectly cast and deliver performances with depth that is rarely seen on the big screen. Scorsese crafts this film with all of his usual intensity and the result is a masterpiece that certainly doesn't feel three hours long! Whether you like mafia films or not, give this one a try... you might be surprised. I certainly was.",

Ace knows how to run the Tangiers in the way it should be run and will use hammers and vices on cheaters who want to defraud his casino. Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) is Ace's hot headed body guard of sorts who will in his own words not let anyone f-word with the Golden Jew. Ginger is Ace's wife who is a drug addicted gambler as well and Ace considers her to be the Queen of the Tangiers because she can bring gamblers in. She has her world in control except for her former pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods). Even though Ginger is a wife and mother she won't let go of the hold Lester has over her! ",

196,15 November 2006,johnnyboyz,7," Although it shouldn't take 2 hours and 51 minutes to tell a good story, Scorsese manages to draw us in.","By 1995, Martin Scorsese had well and truly etched his name into the film making book and Casino is really just a cherry on the icing which was already on the cake; this means it's not a bad thing but just feels unnecessary. Whilst this film took me two sittings to get through (I had to cut it off with about 40 minutes remaining the first time I sat down to watch it), I can still see why it's gained a somewhat cult status amongst the masses.",
197,17 December 2001,JuguAbraham,8, Scorsese's America,"There are different levels to appreciate this work of Scorsese. Pileggi and Scorsese could be presenting an accurate social and political study on the manner in which casinos are run in USA. But it is also a study of how money buys power and success, and corrodes one's humility. It is written in the manner Greek tragedies were written showing the climb to power and the inevitable downfall of the powerful following the state of hubris (here the firing of an incompetent employee with the right connection}. Compare Ace (de Niro's character), thoughtful about mundane details such as alerting a stranger about a good pen that he could well lose at the bar and who winces at Nick's subsequent violent actions, to the later Ace, who is insensitive to violent actions he himself orchestrates. Compare Nick (Pesci), who seeks permission from Ace to live in Las Vegas, to the later Nick, who drunk with power refuses to acknowledge he once asked Ace's permission. In many ways 'Casino' is a director/screenplay writers film than an actors' film. Performances, though commendable, take a back seat. Is it a mere gangster film or is the film using the gangster and hustler backdrop to offer the audience another perspective of America beyond the obvious? The social commentary here is somewhat like Altman's films ""Nashville"" or ""A Wedding"".",
198,23 August 2020,xiaoli7377,9," De Niro, Pesci, and Scorsese Bring Us the Tale of Vegas Mobsters in the 1970s","Martin Scorsese's ""Casino"" is an often overlooked chapter in his storied filmography, and I personally feel this is for good reason. When people talk about Scorsese, they usually like to talk about ""Raging Bull"", ""Taxi Driver"", or ""Goodfellas."" And ""Casino"" draws a few too many parallels with ""Goodfellas"", in my opinion. Both films are told with a past-tense, first person narration of the main character(s) lives. Both chronicle the rise and fall of criminals caught up in the Italian mob. Both have excellent leading performances by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci (no Ray Liotta this time around), who basically play the same archetypes that they did in that previous film. Both are adaptations of books, which were actually (loosely) based on real events. ""Casino"" also had the misfortune of being released a mere five years after ""Goodfellas"", which I consider to be one of the greatest mob movies of all time. While this film is by no means a bad one, it certainly does not tell the most interesting or original tale. It's a hard thing, even for a director as seasoned and revered as Scorsese, to strike lightning twice within that short amount of time with what is essentially the same film retold with a twist.",

201,29 June 2007,wgranger,8, The rise and fall of the Vegas I knew and loved,"If nothing else, this film answers the question of what happened to the Las Vegas of the 70s and 80s that most of us experienced and loved. Ace makes the correct statement that now Vegas is the another DisneyWorld where you can take the whole family to be entertained. I remember when it was a little more adult entertainment - a great floor show, 99 cent T-bone dinners, and reasonably priced rooms - all subsidized by gambling. ",

203,29 November 2000,mozart827,1, AWFUL!!!!,"I absolutely hated this film. It was a complete waste of time, money, and celluloid. The only reason I endured the interminable hours spent on screen by the unpleasant, boring, borish, and nasty characters and the very bad story was I was keeping my friend out of his house so his wife could set up a surprise birthday party.

205,8 August 2003,sausagebrigade,9, A sombre Goodfellas,"Cruelly referred to as Goodfellas: Redux by some, Casino deserves (nay, demands) to be see in it's own right. It isn't as good as Goodfellas, however, mainly because it tries to outdo that wonderful movie with extra lashings of gore (some of the violence is unwatchable), foul language, sex and music, to no avail. It's also inhibited by a narrower scope, taking in only the 70s and the early 80s and by the end, the script dithers as much as Sharon Stone's druggy showgirl. However, Scorsese pulls several impressive tricks, De Niro is effective as a outwardly dull but inwardly seething Jewish gangster, and the dialogue is occasionally inspired. If you can stomach the length of it, this is high quality Scorsese, but only just.",

Martin Scorsese once again gives us a terrific movie, that has been directed Excellently. The movie folds around De Niro running a casino, and having marriage problems with Stone and Problems with a lot of things you can say with Pesci. Robert De Niro delivers yet another Brilliant Performance. Joe Pesci's character Nicky is similar to Goodfellas Tommy. Once again Pesci delivers a Superb performance as the violent Nicky. Sharon Stone looks sexy as ever and surprisingly delivers a Good performance. Casino Entertains Big time thanks to De Niro and Pesci working together. If you look at Pesci in Goodfellas and Pesci in Casino, which one is mightier. Both characters are Violent and a little crazy you can say. Pesci's Casino Character is slightly rougher then Tommy. Anyway Casino is a Must see, if you haven't seen it.",

The second was 1995's ""Casino"". Both movies are based on books by Nicolas Pileggi, and screenplays written both by Pileggi and Scorsese. The movie takes an excellent look inside the old Las Vegas when gangsters ran it. Robert De Niro is in top form as Ace, the main character that works his way up in Vegas. Joe Pesci is also excellent as Nicky, who seems to be a somewhat toned down version of his character Tommy from ""Goodfellas"". This is Pesci's best work to date. Sharon Stone, James Woods, Kevin Pollack, Alan King, Don Rickles, Frank Vincent, L.Q. Jones, and Dick Smothers round up the excellent support cast. The soundtrack to the movie is one of the best assembled. Robert Richardson, who did a majority of Oliver Stone films, does an excellent job at cinematography in his first Scorsese film.

The police tried to stop it, but it was their money which was bringing the city to life. De Niro is great, as usual, Pesci is a show-stealer, and Stone, a novelty in Scorsese's work (as Ray Liotta was in ""Godfellas""), has a much-earned oscar nomination in the role of an empty woman whose path leads to decay.

The story of this movie is beautiful and is portrayed by DeNiro and Pesci at there best. It could not have been any better then it was. The first time I seen this movie I was amazed at how good they captures the world of Vegas and the underworld of Vegas. It is told through the eyes of great performers to give you the great reality of the movie and a great feel to the concept of staying at the top and what people would do to keep that throne. I see this as another masterpiece and a classic that should go down in history as one of the greatest cinematic achievements yet. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.,

230,21 June 2010,tbills2,10, How can you watch this film and not think it's brilliant?,"Casino is an absolute masterpiece. It is easily one of the very best movies ever, but ya it is no Goodfellas, so i guess it stinks. If Casino was titled Goodfellas 2, then I could understand the critiques, but it is a totally different movie, err. None of them make any sense. Every reason I have read that supposedly makes this movie bad is something that doesn't even factor in to whether a movie is good or not. Too much violence - first off, Casino is not excessively violent. The things that happen are but it's obviously not so severe that it's too repulsive to bare or anything close (same goes for Goodfellas). That's nonsense, just like all the other excuses. I am still waiting for one reason to why Casino is not a 4-star, all-time classic movie. I can understand how some can watch it and perceive that it's boring, but you have to listen...there's so much going on. So much depth to the characters. And Scorsese is a genius with editing and directing a film. Casino is an unstoppable movie. It's easily cemented into my top 10. It is one of the most underrated movies with a 3 out of 4 star rating; that is an insult to this masterful film. What are you guys seeing? Nothing is wrong with it. Every scene is powerful. Way to go Scorcese. You give us another cinema classic, and get no love. This movie should be top 20 in the Top250 list, a perfect 10 outta 10.",

232,13 July 2012,ctomvelu1,9, About as good as it gets,"I can't believe I've never reviewed this classic, but that's probably because it is a classic and therefore hard to do it justice in writing. Scorsese gives us an intimate look at 1970s' Las Vegas, when the mob ruled, and courtesy of Pillegi's novel. The plot centers on two childhood pals (DeNiro and Pesci), both ""connected"" and shipped out to Vegas. DeNiro's charismatic character Ace Rothstein runs a casino and hotel, while Pesci's strong-arm thug Nicky Santoro delights in causing old-fashioned mayhem. The difference in their approaches to Sin City will eventually cause them to be at odds with one another. Sharon Stone plays a grifter and prostitute whom DeNiro's character marries, to his eternal dismay, as she cannot shake her old ways. An almost unrecognizable James Woods plays her loser boyfriend. Everyone is at the height of their careers here. The dialogue is sharp, the editing first-rate, the vistas of a now-vanished version of Vegas truly astounding. There are moments when the dialogue is clearly being improvised, which gives the film a more natural feel -- even though I normally associate improvised dialogue with inexpensive indies, not a major Hollywood production. Along with Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" and Mann's ""Heat,"" a must-see.",
233,16 July 2002,casey_choas66,10, ***** out of 5,"This movie gains five stars because it is nothing less than perfection. Robert De Niro is at his personal best as he give a white hot performance that could melt the varnish right off you kitchen table. Never has a man delivered his lines with such power and personal angst as this man, he is truley one of the most gifted actors on the planet. But it is not De Niro himself he is also giving an amazing script by Nicholas Pileggi, the same man who brough us Goodfellas and one of Americans greatest directors of all time Martin Scorsese. Joe Pesci is also fantastic as a violent mobster who is like a walking time bomb. Sharen Stone and James Woods are also in top form as well. It is the three hour plus story of the owner of one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas. We go through his ups and downs of life and his business. This is by far one of the grestest movies ever made and I am shocked at how even though it is over three hours long it never becomes boring and in fact even blinking might make you miss to much of this amazing gritty and very powerful drama. I have also found that out of all the actors De Niro is one of the only people who actually make swearing sound cool and you better believe there is a never ending stream of it here. If you like Goodfellas this movie is not to be missed since it follows the same basic formal just on a much larger scale. Not to be missed at any cost",

I get the feeling while watching it that I could re- order most of the scenes and it would play just as well.

Basically the film gives us an insight into the dark world behind the glitz and glimmer of Las Vegas, the gambling capital of America, maybe even the world. Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) runs one of the biggest and most successful casinos in Vegas, the Tangiers, with Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) helping him out, they are the mobsters that know everything there is to know about the running of a casino. They know how that the customer are never the winners, the money goes through a system of checks, they can spot the cheaters, and they know how the staff should be doing their jobs in the way they want. For about an hour and a quarter the film consists of the two friends, since childhood, narrating their knowledge of the gambling business, and then Ace meets Ginger McKenna (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Sharon Stone), a sure fire charmer to lure rich gamblers into the joint. Ace is the smooth operator, while the often troubling Nicky is the violent one who will beat someone if they cross the casino. As I mentioned, there is a dark side to the world of Las Vegas, and that is seen by Ace and Nicky, as Ace is lured into loving a hustler who he wrongly trusts with his most treasured assets, and Nicky gets involved with too much violence, drugs and alcohol. In the end, the whole casino and all of its building blocks come tumbling down, all the key staff members and mob heads are killed, including Nicky who is beaten heavily and buried alive, Ginger gets shot, and Ace only just survives his car blowing up. Also starring James Woods as Lester Diamond, Toy Story's Don Rickles as Billy Sherbert, Rush Hour 2's Alan King as Andy Stone, Kevin Pollak as Phillip Green, L.Q. Jones as Pat Webb, Dick Smothers as Senator and Frank Vincent as Frank Marino. DeNiro and Pesci both create vibrant gangster like characters, and Stone certainly deserved her Academy Award nomination for being a real hard-edge vamp, filled with the same sort of stuff GoodFellas gave us, the lust for power, the domination of money, some sleaze and some really graphic scenes, it is certainly a must see crime drama. Very good!",
242,21 May 2005,coop-16,10, a stunning epic,"It usually takes a decade or more for people to wise up to to a Scorsese film, and notice how brilliant it really is...just witness all the sneering comments being made about Gangs and Aviator. When Casino came out, its only high profile defender was Ebert. Most of the other critics, and not just the usual suspects( such as a certain hack whose initials are M.M).thought it was just an knock off of Goodfellas. This is , to put it bluntly, absurd. This film is one of the three or four greatest organized crime epics.The texture, the rhythm, the pace, the color, and the horror of Las Vegas are captured with bold brush strokes.The costumes, the music, the editing, the cinematography..all are brilliant. I will comment on the acting... Robert De Niro portrays someone hes never portrayed before in a Scorsese film..a cool headed, calculating near genius.His Achilles heel is his pride in his intelligence. He cannot imagine that he can make a mistake, and it leads to his fall. Joe Pesci offers a better performance than in Goodfelllas, because his character has more screen time and is far more complex. Yes..he is a violent, destructive man. He also imagines himself to be extremely loyal, a good family man, etc. Note how reluctant he is to torture the guy using the vise..its just that he knows that if he doesn't, HIS head will be in the vise.Note the weird grace notes , like combing the hair of the woman he shoots. Finally, Sharon Stone.This is a woman who who is pitifully weak and confused, for all her outward bravado. James Woods (a stunning portrayal) plays her like a Stradivarius.). The last shot of Ms. Stone in the movie(I will not give it away)is terrifying-and pitiful. every performance in this movie,from the biggest star turn to the smallest cameo,is dazzling..the use of Stardust at the end is brilliant.

243,27 November 2015,goreilly40,10, A classic,"Many have said that this was Goodfellas on a grander scale, and in many ways they're correct, but this isn't detrimental to the movie. The story is a fascinating look at how one of the most iconic cities came to be and how the influence and money of the Mafia built the world famous Las Vegas strip, how the Mafia's empire in Vegas came to be and in the end how (and in some cases literally) it came crashing down. The use of narration is well done and the acting is simply brilliant, Robert De Niro is in top form as the flamboyant bookmaker turned casino manager Sam 'Ace' Rothstein whose tyrannical no nonsense management style would contribute to his downfall. Joe Pesci picks up from where he left off in Goodfellas playing psychotic enforcer Nicky Santorio brilliantly whose violent temper ends up bringing trouble to just about everyone he comes into contact with. L.Q. Jones turns in an underrated performance as the deceptive commissioner Pat Webb, whose easy going good ole boy exterior disguises his real power and influence. Likewise James Woods portrayal of the sleazy pimp Lester Diamond while brief was well done. Onto Frank Vincent and I couldn't help but think he got some satisfaction over getting his own back on Joe Pesci when near the end he does to him what Pesci did to his character in Goodfellas, I think its safe to say he enjoyed that. But the star of the show is Sharon Stone who turns in an outstanding performance as the prostitute turned hustler Ginger McKenna whose devotion to her former pimp boyfriend, her drinking and drug addictions and her reckless behaviour would end up leading to her ultimate demise, Stone put herself through the grinder for the movie, losing so much weight the production team were actually worried about her, changing her hair styles and the emotional outbursts which were done brilliantly, and Stone's performance as a result was Oscar worthy. The portrayal of the mob bosses was also very well done, particularly Pasquale Cajano as Remo Gaggi, who gave a convincing performance as a ruthless mob boss. The rest of the supporting cast were all solid, Kevin Pollak, Alan King, Don Rickles and Billy Allison all turned in fine performances. The movie has got some criticism for its level of violence and profanity but this is the world of organised crime which wasn't exactly known for its eloquence and for its gentleness when it came to 'taking care' of things, so a subtler approach wouldn't have been an accurate depiction of the people and the events the movie is based on. So for those fans of gangster movies and even for history lovers like me this movie is a must see.",

Robert De Niro as always superb along with Joe Pesci and James Woods et al. I'm saying the film belonged to Sharon Stone. She was more than convincing as the meretricious demimonde. Her character began as a shooting star and deteriorated to a burnt out derelict. She should have won the Oscar for this awesome portrayal. Direction was meticulous with each shot and scene saying something pertinent to the plot. I did not appreciate the F word used so many times. it tends to cheapen the film. What did we do for sixty years before the F word was used?? I'm fortunate in viewing the film on TV where the filth was dubbed over. I remember seeing a film called ""Glen Gary, Glen Ross"" I had to leave the theatre due to the senseless filth in the language. I mean really stupid, unnecessary profanity. Later I saw the film on TV sans the filth. It was a very good film. I have nothing but praise for Casino and all connected with it. Kudos to Martin Scorcese.",

Casino is embellished with a lot of flashy overhead shots of nighttime Las Vegas, but underneath all that, you'll find a compelling and gritty drama full of great characters, a complex and winding plot that will have you stuck to your seat for the full three hours - not an easy feat, I might add - with multiple subplots that all remain interesting. They intertwine and twist into the great drama that is the individual man's life, and there are countless scenes here that will remain memorable: the introduction of each major character, Joe Pesci interacting with his young son, Sharon Stone interacting with her leeching ex-boyfriend, the scene where Robert DeNiro stands in the desert as the dust from Pesci's car kicks up around him, and the countless scenes of upper-class suburban Los Vegas juxtaposed with the chaotic, grimy personal lives of those who inhabit it.",

The documentary style filming by Martin Scorcese during the first 40 minutes delves deep into the inner workings of a mob run casino. The first 40 minutes is brilliant. From there the movie chronicles Ace Rothstein's marriage, his business of running the casino, his hitman pal Nicky Santaro, and his wife's affair with Nicky. I really, really love Robert DeNiro and here he has a great supporting cast: Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone, Don Rickles, James Woods, and Frank Vincent. All of them put on great performances. I love mob movies anyways but this one rocks. It's got a great soundtrack. Frank Vincent and Joe Pesci steal the show with the two best characters. And the ending scene of Joe Pesci and his brother being beaten to death with baseball bats in a corn field then buried alive to the tune of Eric Burdon's ""The House Of The Rising Sun"" is probably five of my most favorite minutes in film ever.

In that same year came Miller's Crossing, and Quentin Tarantino added to the palette with both Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.

Joe Pesci tilts the head and blood comes from the mouth. No too fake. Anothing I didn't like was that Joe Pesci. He can act but he isn't all that good in the bad guy role.

258,8 June 2019,christopher-underwood,9, it would have been a lesser film without Stone.,"From the mesmerising Saul Bass opening credit sequence, being an abstract mosaic created from inter-cut close-ups of Vegas neon, to the re-run of the exploding car, this is one brash and beautiful beast all the way. Of course, longer than it really should be, with maybe too many shots of the counting room and cash being channelled noisily, but then everything here is appropriately excessive, not least the violence. The language is confrontational, the lighting and colour shrill but the seamless editing draws us along, in what is essentially a rather slim story, eager to indulge further in the gluttony on display and arrogant swagger, shamelessly celebrated. I'm not a great fan of De Niro but he does well here, his rather flat delivery providing excellent contrast to the performance of a lifetime from Sharon Stone. Despite the amazing skills of Scorsese in bringing off this amazing cinematic epic with such pizzazz, it would have been a lesser film without Stone. Much criticised, she is undeniably an actress who with the right incentive can, seemingly effortlessly, lift a movie way out of the norm. If not more important than Taxi Driver, this probably is the better film due to the exuberance and sheer love of cinematic movement on display, oh and awareness of the importance of a superlative soundtrack.",

I don't think I spoiled much, while watching this classic, the thing I was astounded after watching it, was how quick the three hours flew. You know you really enjoying a flick, when you want more. Great movie, that is has a spirit of something fresh. As we proceed it is has tragedy of a family destroyed, the backstabbing of supposed friends, the mob and its ways.

I often have both, feelings of sympathy and feelings of revulsion towards the people in his movies. The same feeling occurs towards Las Vegas and its casinos in ""Casino"". On the one hand Scorsese glorifies the old casinos. When Ace laments in the end, that today Las Vegas is nothing more than a gambling Disneyland, we suffer with him. It's a place run by emotionless businessman. On the other hand, however, Scorsese knows about the victims that the old system claimed, about the abyss behind the shiny surface. The film is acted very well by the ""Goodfellas""-duo Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, while the biggest surprise for me was Sharon Stone. For me Ginger is a victim of this system, although some people might argue that she herself is responsible for the situation she's in.

The star of the film was De Niro's talent and sensitivity in portraying a man who is never sensitive himself.

He re-assembles his regular cast, adds a soupçon of Sharon Stone and proceeds to make three hours of cinema fly by. It all centres around the aspirational ""Sam Rothstein"" (Robert De Niro) who realises that there is a great deal of money to be made in Las Vegas in the 1970s. To that end, he is sent by his mafia bosses to run the ""Tangiers"" casino, hotel and general den of iniquity. Initially, though ruthless enough, he has a degree of decency to him, and when he falls in love with hustler ""Ginger"" (Sharon Stone) things seem to suggest that maybe he could be destined for the straight(-ish) and narrow. The same can not be said for his friend ""Santoro"" (Joe Pesci) who comes out to join him - ostensibly to make sure he stays safe - and is soon up to no good fleecing whatever and whoever to pay for his hedonistic lifestyle. It'd have been dull if all had gone to plan, and of course it doesn't - ""Rothstein"" has to deal with crooks, authorities (not that they are mutually exclusive), his increasingly rogue wife and his downright liability of a friend. Things come to an head when his wife and her former beau/pimp ""Diamond"" (James Woods) force his hand, the gaming commission wants his licence and ""Santoro"" - well, he is just toxic. Pesci only ever really has one style of acting, and this is perfect for that. He adds a distinctly plausible nastiness to his frankly rather odious character. Stone features a bit too sparingly perhaps, but she certainly steals the scenes she shares with a measured and confident De Niro very much at the top of his game. A nice little twist at the end works very well, too! It's stylishly photographed and has a great look to it - good stuff, this.",
287,7 December 2002,Sfpsycho415,9, An excellent gangster film!---9/10,"After seeing this and Goodfellas i have come to a theory: All movies should star Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. These two geniuses can turn any movie into a masterpiece. They can make you laugh and cry pretty much at the same time. The film follows Ace Rothstien (De Niro) when he gets the biggest prize a gambler can get: his own casino. Of course he has to pay the mobsters who gave it to them. He also has to deal with the violent and costly exploits of his friend Nicky (Pesci). Joe Pesci again perfects the loud mouth loose cannon character as he did in Goodfellas, but i think here he was given a more important part. Robert De Niro can not fail. You can see the stress and anger in his eyes in this film. Martin Scorsese is the world's greatest director. Screw the Academy. He should have won the best director Oscar several times by now. I would love to see him do more work with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. This is a classic gangster picture that is always compared to Goodfellas.

Martin Scorsese really is the master of gangster movies, no doubt about it, yet the novelist Nicholas Pileggi deserves kudos too.  People say this movie tries to hard to be like Goodfellas and I think thats a terrible description.  The reason for this I think is that Joe Pesci's Nicky is too much the same character as his Tommy in Goodfellas.  If they had of put someone else in that role, possibly Benicio DelToro or an Edward Norton with an Italian makeover, then Casino would have gotten more individual praise.

Some people say that Casino is a replica of Goodfellas but I don't see that at all. The only things i see that are the same are that Casino is about organized crime and Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are in this movie.,

I wont waste time outlining the plot in detail, I'm sure other reviews have that covered. The mixed reaction this film has been given has absolutely stunned me, reviews range from the worst film people have ever seen to the most impressive they have ever seen. This is of course the most underrated film of all time and not enough credit has been given to Scorsese, De Niro, pesci, stone and even the supporting cast including frank Vincent. The reason for much of this films criticism is its comparisons to goodfellas. This is not goodfellas or a goodfellas inspired film! (despite Nicholas peliggi's involvement). De niro and pesci surpass their performance in goodfellas with much to spare in this film. Pesci in particular has added more venom to his performance than seen in goodfellas (which was already as venomous as a venomous snake swimming around in venom).",

That is important since it's not sheer incompetence which brought this guys down; it's lust and dishonest in their personal sphere, especially Sam's unhappy marriage. That's why this is the very first line in the movie: ""When you love someone, you've gotta trust them.""

305,3 February 2000,classldy,6, Basic mob movie with Deniro and Pesci playing same characters,This movie is as predictable as DeNiro and Pesci get playing mobster type roles.  Pesci is simply to unbelievable to beat up guys bigger than he or to have a romance with Sharon Stone.  No range of emotion for DeNiro playing it stolid through out the hole movie. Even when he's angry he just yells no facial expressions of emotions.  Sharon Stone plays it to the hilt with believably as DeNiro's ex hooker junkie wife.,
306,22 January 2008,shadowman123,8, An amazing film!,"I had bought my-self a copy of Casino a while back ago but never did get round to watching it, however on Sunday I did as I thought I would keep up with my gangster movie phase I am going through, however unfortunately whilst watching it , my disc messed up and I got annoyed as anything (never purchase second hand DVD's). However the very next morning I got up and went to my local rental shop and watched it. All I can say is - WOW!, I mean I thought Goodfella's once probably Scorces's best work but I can probably say he has topped that with this beaut! No one is truly a fan of the gangster genre without paying homage to this. This movie had all the ingredients to keep to make a recipe for disaster and Scorecse just brighten's it up for us which keeps us hooked. The most funny I found about this movie was that Robert De Niro reminds me of my own ex-boss, his constant nagging and micro-management of everything might seem good to others , but then to the rest of us he just seemed like a control freak and all round ass hole. But I guess thats what keeps you in tune with the character because no matter how much we hate it ranting and raving we all know the stuff he is saying is true and oddly enough I thought to my-self thats what really matters in the movie. Joe Pesci was just nothing short of brilliant, I felt that this time he was let of the leash big time and he did provide a lot of the entertainment especially with his 21 F-U rant in just 2 mins! Sharon Stone was brilliant , normally in gangster movies I have noted that the women are either there for eye candy or their presence in the movie is not of a an big or major significance but I was glad to think that it did not happen over here as her performance is note worthy! Scorcese's makes Casino a pseudo-documentary with his clever use of commentary telling us what we all ready know about Vegas but with its use of colours, lights , music and glitz and glamour one is taken in by its hedonism and it because easy to understand how someone got taken into this world of lust,power and deception and greed. Nearly everything I have covered is probably covered in all the other the comments that people have posted on here...but the reason behind is that it is all true . To conclude Casino should be on every film geeks '100 movies to watch before I die list'. The only problem I had was that a few moments in it were a little bit long which made it drag and it is a long movie so do have a clear mind when you watch it.",

Casino is a masterpiece of a mob film from Martin Scorsese, and in my opinion better than the well received Goodfellas...and I don't know if I could tell you why, that's just the way I feel. There are many obvious similarities since they're both created by Scorsese, both have DeNiro and Pesci, and in both the s*** hits the fan in the end. They are frequently compared in reviews so I'll say, for the record, that I enjoy Casino much more.

Different colors but with his rugged complextion he carried them off beautifully. And he was dressed impeccably. Sharon Stone was also dressed to the nines. And their spacious and sprawling home was to die for. Joe Pesci looked like he had a face lift. I wonder?

I also like to start reviews of positively so I will say that I loved the world that was set up in this film, the whole mobster world hidden behind the guise of casinos in Las Vegas was a very entertaining aspect to this movie. Robert DeNiro is really good in this film I loved the scenes he had with Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone he was very imposing and did a great job in this film. Joe Pesci was good but it definitely felt like we've seen things like this from him before. But by far the best performance in this movie was Sharon Stone she was amazing in this movie she was perfect at conveying a damaged and sick woman with no way out and her break down scenes are just amazing to watch. This movie is extremely violent but I loved that about this movie, the violence was effective it showed the brutality of this system and made it feel all the more realistic. However I think this movie has some very big flaws that people has ignored. For one the first 30-45 minutes of this movie are nothing but exposition through narration your given all the inner workings of this world and everyone in it but it just doesn't work because it's given to you all at once and your struggling to catch up and should have been given slower and more gradually across the movie. Another massive issue that has been addressed with this movie is how many similarities it has to Goodfellas but it never comes close to matching that films greatness. Since its structured and layed out so similarly to Goodfellas the film feels like it has the massive hole in it, since the characters that DeNiro and Pesci are playing in this film are so similar to their characters in that movie you feel as if there should be another character in it to fill the place of a Henry Hill but there isn't and the film never recovers from that. This film is also very long and makes for a lot of moments to drag on and I wasn't really satisfied with how they wrapped up Sharon Stones character arc. ",

I must give kudos to Sharon Stone she was absolutely brilliant in this film. Robert DeNiro was and is mostly always absolutely brilliant in every movie he's in.

347,3 May 2006,vitobenson,8, Casino was and still is a great Gangster movie,"Yet another gangster film in the same flavor as Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese show's us the ups and the downs of gangster life from Kansas City to Las Vegas and back again. The film is Casino, based in Las Vegas in the Seventies, the original Sin City, we are now presented with the dirt of the Vegas underworld that often isn't even seen in the pit rows of the casino halls. I enjoyed Robert De Niro, (Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein) a professional gambler selected by the mob to run the biggest casino in town. You really start to believe Ace as a real business man looking to run a straight and clean establishment. Things seem to be going his way until his childhood friend, the wacky and crazy Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci) turns up with his own very different agenda, of how he is going to run things for himself and thus the mob bosses in Vegas Gangster movies remain to be cool and I can watch them over and over again and I look for the next one to be a little more modern day to see how things have changed over the last 10 years. Casino is a well directed, acted and edited masterpiece, which does a great job telling the story of 2 friends that in the end don't quit see things eye to eye.",
348,27 June 2012,joet1999,10," Casino, at cut above most","Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese collide in their eighth and final (to date) film in their partnership in this true story about gangster who get it all wrong. Based on the true story of Frank Rosenthal and Tony Spilotro this was bound to be good and by geez it delivered. Voiceovers, constant background music and also constant swearing (423 f-bombs!) result to make a very powerful film that is very well acted and also is told brilliantly. Scorsese uses a method which he also used in Raging Bull where he begins from near the end. The first voice-over really gets you interested, as soon as Robert De Niro's character says this you know the film is going to be good: 'When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point? And for a while, I believed, that's the kind of love I had'. This first line got me interested immediately and I am sure it will make most viewers want to watch for the whole three hour period. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci come together in a film for the third time and once again they click instantly, De Niro the successful guy who runs the casino, Pesci the man who stops anyone get in De Niro's way, it really is great stuff and you really start to believe that they are the characters and are not just acting. Sharon Stone showcased her talent like no one thought she could in this film and certainly deserved her Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast are also brilliant and get you into the film with such ease it seems like you can't see or hear all the carnage that is going down on screen. Music plays a huge part in the film and in fact there are 61 different songs used in this film, most of them actually being proper songs that are not soundtrack songs. The one criticism for the film is that sometimes the music was on at unnecessary times and you could occasionally not hear as well as you might. To compare this to other Robert De Niro-Martin Scorsese films would (in my opinion) put it third on the list and this was certainly an amazing film. Comparing it to other gangster films is a bit different but I would still say it it up there with such masterpieces as The Godfather, if not possibly better. Watch this if you are not disturbed by scenes of ultra-violence and world record swearing, it will be damn well worth it.",

It stands as one of Scorsese's longest movies, only beaten by ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". But just like ""Wolf"", this movie will leave you on the edge of your seat, for a whopping 3 hours, never losing it's intensity for a second. Scorsese might be the only director in history to sustain such rapid fire, intense power on screen for that long. It's classic DeNiro and Pesci, enough said. The real unique gem of a performance in this movie belongs to Sharon Stone. She's plays a character about as despicable as the mobsters themselves, and fascinatingly enough, you'll tend to root against her. It's Scorsese's oldest tactic, which is to make you interested in awful people, and perhaps seeing the traits of them that are overlooked.

Rob Deniro and Joe Peschi give top notch performances as the lead mobsters running the Tangiers casino in Vegas. In the first half we are shown how Deniro's character tightly operates his casino. He knows all the tricks in the books that hustlers try to pull, however noone can pull a one up on this guy. Peschi is his hitman who does most of the dirty work, but is eventually banned from all casinos. Turning in a fiery, top notch (Oscar nomination) performance is Sharon Stone as a drug hustler who enchants Deniro one day as she shows up at the casino. They marry and he hopes to ""make"" him fall in love with her one day, because her true love is a pimp (played by James Wood). Needless to say the last hour or so of this movie is vicious as we see the FBI crackdown on all the schemes the mobsters were trying so hard to hide in the casinos. Stone and Peschi, in particular have brutal demises. 9.3/10 extreme profanity, violence, and partial nudity. Excellent acting, direction, plot, and soundtrack.

It's a movie of two halves with the first covering the operation as a whole with quite a lot of detail regarding the inner workings of their sleaze pit, and the second deals more with the downfall of each character. Sharon Stone plays one of the most hateful god-diggers ever, and Joe Pesci is more or less the same character he played in Goodfellas. The movie ends with other side of all that money, jewels, and luxury in a bitter tasting manner with a really quite brutal death scene highlighting the reality of greed and power and where it can lead.

Scorsese simply makes all other gangster films inferior with his mastery.  You can leave this film on mute and still really enjoy it.  But then you'll miss the best dialogue of any gangster movie in 25 years.  It's overwhelming how quotable this movie is.  People that write this film off need to explain where the weakness in this film lies.  Even the soundtrack is incredible.  The acting is ridiculously good and should be the measuring stick for all films within this genre.

371,9 August 2021,jdring2007,7," a Joe Pesci vehicle also starring De Niro with an absurd amount of talking and narration, but impressively acted and filmed","There's no denying this is a great movie. It's a crime epic, frankly, but while I'm being honest I will say that it takes well over half an hour for anything to really ""happen."" That said, for me, the real pull in this Scorsese ""classic"" is undeniably Joe Pesci. When compared to Goodfellas, I'd choose Goodfellas over Casino every day, but even in that film Pesci was a favorite. In Casino he has more room to shine, and he delivers a disturbingly great performance beginning to end. This isn't to say that De Niro and others aren't superb; De Niro really excels in the last hour. It's such a cohesive movie, inspired by real events too, that it often feels like a documentary. Which I think is probably the biggest compliment one could give a movie and its actors. My main gripe is the heavy narration in the first two hours and the length. It often felt like a lot of the script was repeating itself, especially in the first act. At three hours and very little ""action"" within the first two, but enough talking to give you a headache, I couldn't wait for the third to be over...but that's when the movie really gets going. Knowing about all the improvisation throughout the movie, especially between De Niro and Pesci, and James Woods, made me respect the acting even more.

375,23 May 2019,RossRivero99,9, One of Scorsese's finest crime dramas,"Martin Scorsese is without a doubt one of the finest individuals to ever sit behind a movie camera having directed great films like ""Raging Bull"", ""The Departed"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Gangs of New York"", ""Hugo"", and ""The Aviator"" this movie is a welcomed addition to that already masterful resume for me. This movie is the ninth collaboration between Scorsese and his right hand man Robert De Niro and so far it's their most recent until their upcoming Netflix film ""The Irishman"" comes out later this year. De Niro stars as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein who owns a casino in Las Vegas called the ""Tangiers"" and happens to be based on Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal who started out as a sports better in Chicago and the mob decides that he would be a potential asset to their income and decides to send him to Vegas to run a casino. Rothstein then moves down to Vegas to run the place and not long after his best friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) along with his brother Dominic (Philip Suriano), and his associate Frankie Marino (Frank Vincent) are sent by the mob bosses to make sure everything in the place runs smoothly. Rothstein's trusted manager is an older guy named Billy Sherbert (Don Rickles) who at his side at all times during working hours and also watches everything that goes on and makes sure nobody does anything wrong. Then one day while the casino is in operation Rothstein sees a blond haired woman who he instantly falls in love with named Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) who is a hustler and former prostitute who has a pimp friend named Lester Diamond (James Woods) who she has known since they were kids and sometimes presents obstacles in her marriage to Rothstein. The movie's story is more than just the rise and fall of a mob family but also the downfall of one man's life, relationships, and wealth. Scorsese is a director who pays an immense attention to every little detail in his movies which makes it feel like you are there in the movie with his characters going through certain things in their lives, and in this case presents the excess that the characters live in perfectly proving that money can't make your life happy no matter how much you may have, and there are dire consequences with messing with a mobster's trust. This is one of the most violent gangster movies I've ever seen. Scorsese's direction is always in top form especially with this movie and his screenplay that he co-wrote with Nicholas Pileggi (who also co-wrote the screenplay for ""Goodfellas"" as well as the books that both films are based on.) Robert Richardson's cinematography is excellent same with the editor by Scorsese's longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker. The acting is also superb especially by Stone who nabbed an Oscar nomination for best actress who managed to get the movie its only nomination. But however my only problem with the movie is that it seemed a little bit on the long side for me which makes it seem a bit drawn out and at the same time is justified due to Scorsese's fast pacing and deep focus into Rothstein's personal life, and as a result is one of the best inside stories about a gangster I've ever seen along with ""The Godfather"" series, ""Scarface"", and ""Goodfellas"". The movie is one of the best of its kind and is a near masterpiece.",

'Cape Fear' was pretty much a solid thriller as well, but that film was a little too tense and frightening. This is really his one film where you can safely switch off your brain, and just relax and watch Scorsese do his thing. The fantastic visuals, the humour, the incredible sets and of course the masterful editing all together contribute to what is finally a lavish and jaw-dropping feast of a film. The way Scorsese directs his actors and sets his scenes with such utter perfection - the whole thing just makes you giddy with delight and blows your senses. Also, this movie is going to make you love 70s' American music - I guarantee it ! All the actors are a pleasure to watch here. In particular, James Woods as the ""country club golf hustler"" is hilarious - strange, why doesn't Scorsese cast him more often ??

He created an undisputed, instant classic for which all of his subsequent films - as well as all other Mafia films - would be measured against. As magnificent as ""Goodfellas"" is, it can be considered a curse. This is evident in ""Casino"", Scorsese's more-or-less follow-up to the life depicted in ""Goodfellas"". It is an impressive achievement, even more dense and visceral than ""Goodfellas"", but it has received some derision over the years by those who have accused Scorsese of ""copying himself.""

Joe Pesci plays his friend, Nicky Santoro, from back home years ago who comes out to A) Protect Sam and the casino and B) make some cash for himself. He does just that. Along the way, Sam begins a relationship with Ginger, a hustler at the casino played by Sharon Stone. It tells the story of how the mob controlled casinos, and how people like these helped mess it up. From the opening scenes, one can see that Scorsese is following the Goodfellas format of flashback/voiceover work, but this benefits the movie. DeNiro and Pesci are on top form again, as is Sharon Stone surprisingly. Over all, a very well written, acted and directed film, the only drawback being it's length.

In Goodfellas, Pesci kills Vincent and buries him. In Casino, at the end, Vincent kills Pesci with a baseball bat and then ""ships"" and buries him. I believe most people like the violence- they just don't want to admit it.",
395,3 August 2007,shortround8391,10, Wow....just wow....,"This movie has gotta be the most underrated film ever. I think the reason why people don't consider this a classic is because everyone has to constantly compare this movie to Goodfellas and because of this they say that Casino is somewhat of a rip off of Goodfellas, WHY? Because it has a similar cast? BIG DEAL. In my opinion I actually think Casino is better and more enjoyable and not to mention more realistic, in the movie pretty much all the gangsters are extremely violent which is what gangsters are in real life, this case, you've gotta point out the character Nicky (Pesci) for that since there's a scene where he actually stabs a tough guy with a pen and makes him begging for his life and another when he crushes a guys head in a vise. And Ace (DeNiro) when he caught two cheaters in his casino and had one of them get his hand smashed with a hammer.",

Like Raging Bull and Goodfellas, Casino never veers into unwatchability, remaining inspired throughout, especially for those interested in the truth, whether it be about the Mafia or no. The real truth here is the heart of mankind, which is filled with evil. The perpetual lure of sex and violence, end of the world hypocrisy, the false faces that cover the insatiable lust and love of money. Man's inability to avoid corruption, the ease with which he walks and rides roughshod, to roll in destruction and without remorse. The real world extremes of what people are capable of. Of what seeds are planted in the soil of the human heart, and the flowers of evil that are nurtured and grown. Martin Scorsese is an end of the world prophet here, and this underrated masterpiece is one of the brightest sermons he ever delivered. A latter day warning to mankind that the eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.",
397,30 October 2020,jordanpiche,9, Why should you watch this movie?,"I grew up in the nineties and the most worn out movies in my VHS collection was Casino and Resivior Dogs. The consensus was Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction were the better of the two and I thought I agreed. Although, after 25 years my opinion is a lot more constructive. Goodfellas is not good, it's great but Casino is different. Yes it is a mob movie and it's within 5 years of the great Goodfellas but it takes what was innovative in GF and it improves it. The colours, the set design, the costumes and the music really leaves an impression, almost like Scorcese was showing off his one of kind, unique style and finally perfected it. I love Goodfellas but Casino is something else, it's rich and long, the characters are almost too much, but it works. It is well worth the almost 3hr commitment ,it captures a mob story set in 1970s Las Vegas, a Las Vegas that will never be seen again. I High recommend this.",

The acting of course was great along with the directing. The set design was very memorable, honestly probably the most memorable thing to me was the looks and shots of Las Vegas and the casino. It had a neat way to shoot all those scenes and I think that is one of the best things about it. Overall, while not better than Goodfellas. Casino holds its own when it comes to Mob films.

I love Rickles cast as the manager, and his joke about the private jet problems, ""Hey, better down here than up there, you know what I mean"". Pescis' scene rousting the 2 hoods inside the Tangiers is just typical of his acumen as an actor. The final scene of Sharon Stones' demise backed by the over-echoed Animals song ""House of the Rising Sun"" is sheer brilliance. Solid 9/10.",

Casino captures the rise and fall of mob-controlled Vegas. It captures how lack of control, and later, overcontrol led the mob to destroy their golden goose.

405,15 September 2019,ntvnyr30,3, Disliked it more and more since it was first released,"I saw this when it was first released and it has not exactly grown on me. Scorsese peaked with ""Goodfellas"" and tried to re-create that magic with the same screenwriter, Nicholas Pileggi. He cast his usual trusty team of DeNiro and Pesce and Sharon Stone to play Ginger. The best of these was Stone, who reminded me of a lot of fake, greedy women I met in Las Vegas. DeNiro's character was just not likeable or sympathetic to me. Pesce was over-the-top psychopathic and his attempt at a Chicago accent was probably accurate, but annoying and distracting. James Woods was great as the slimeball Lester.
I thought the affair between Stone and the much shorter Pesce was comical.
The violence was too much, causing my date to shudder. Did we really need to see one of the gangsters spitting on the hero? Do we need to give the weak minded more examples of depravity?",

Coppola, Scorsese and Darabont-you expect brilliant dialog, narration and direction. Casino, is another masterpiece with Las Vegas connection by Scorsese. The narration has no depth as in ""Good Fellas"". Sharon Stone looks stunning and probably the beginning of her typecasting in movies. She plays the drug addict to the hilt. The movie is very close to the Vegas that existed in the Sixties and Seventies. Ace Rothstein's attorney portrayed by Oscar Goodman is now the current Mayor of Las Vegas. The movie is incredibly gripping with great acting that has tradionally expected from a Scorese film, but the Casting will never be like the ""Good Fellas"".The movie takes off where the masterpiece ""Bugsy"" left-off when it comes to the Las Vegas history. The scene where the brothers are done away with is gorily authentic you see only in Scorsese movies.

422,23 October 2000,jacob.rosen,10, A Fitting Coda,"The feeling of revisited material notwithstanding, Martin Scorsese's close of his New Mafia trilogy (""Main Streets"" and ""GoodFellas"" were the first two chapters) is striking for its last-gasp desperation and depletion: when it runs out of steam it simply expires--there's nothing left. The expulsion of the Mob from Las Vegas also serves to reinforce Scorsese's recurring themes of redemption and ascension; here both are mutually exclusive and to be redeemed and delivered from hell means an existence in purgatory. (Heaven, meanwhile, is reserved for the blue-haired innocents who have become the guests of the corporations that have purged Vegas from sin.) By the time it's over, Scorsese seems exhausted; he doesn't have anything left to say on the subject and it looks doubtful he ever will. Still, if he never makes another masterpiece, this will be a fitting coda on a remarkable subject.",

I've only been there once, but I was completely awestruck by the delicious, glowing obscenity of it all (mind you I'm a jaded New Yorker, not some babe in the woods). ""Casino"" only adds to the fantasy. The irony is that while Vegas is seen as a separate universe where vice is as commonplace as streetlights, it's probably the only HONEST city in the world. Every other city is as full of vice and corruption, but Vegas is the only place that admits that these things are at the core of our lovely civilization. Scorsese has many tools at his disposal; here he uses his scalpel and Bedazzler above all else. The one thing that really bugged me (other than the usual Italian-American stereotypes, but what are you gonna do) is the OVER-use of voice-over. Voice-over is pretty annoying to begin with, but here it's just way too much. It almost sucks the life out of the movie (especially when coupled with Scorsese's snappy montage style). Visually it's quite breathtaking, and the performances are top-notch, especially from Sharon Stone, who emits a raw energy not common among today's leading ladies.",

Scorsese has a fascination with the mafia and there is a lot you could say about the mafia, unfortunately most of it wouldn't work for a Hollywood film so he keeps telling practically the same story over and over again which is unfortunate. So once again we see this cool mob man played by Robert De Niro in a superb performance who is well standing in the community, and than we have his boy-hood friend the psychotic played by Joe Pesci who once again deserves and Oscar, and well we go from there.

It is brutally violent but these scenes are few and far between enough so that they don't distract from the story.However, it seems a little to familiar to another Scorsese classic, GoodFellas.
The similarities are obvious. There's a voiceover throughout the film, the relationship between De Niro and Stone is greatly similar to Liota and Braccos relationship in GoodFellas.

May not be the same wisdom as he had in Goodfellas, but much more of a brutal, ego filling mobster - at first protecting, but jeopardizing all the Mob influence had in Vegas which was the beginning of the end for them controlling casino's and their teamster ties. Scorsese masters the filmaking of these longtime actors, with Sharon Stone coming along for the ride, with truer feelings than in any other mob movie he has made. This was more, of a drama - soap opera than what can be called a mob movie. If you haven't seen it which is doubtful.

I didn't really like the way De Niro and Pesci just kinda told the story. It would have been better if they left all that out. But other than that this was a really good movie. I think everyone should go see it, it's a great acting job by De Niro, Pesci, and Sharon Stone (she is absolutely NUTS in the movie by the way and plays it perfectly).

He used the story of Casino however as a canvas, painting a landscape where so many distinct and wonderfully portrayed ideas interact. We see Manhood, addiction, anger, weakness, wealth, and so many other abstract concepts in conversation with one another. This is a beautiful film showing a man's journey through wealth and power.

What's great about Casino is how real the violence and emotions of the characters are. First is the acting. Sharon Stone gives a terrific performance and Ginger, the out of control don't-you-know-she'll-be-trouble-girl. Robert DeNiro as Ace is also a very wise choice, because DeNiro can play the complete opposite of his character in Goodfellas. Jimmy in Goodfellas was a strong and intimidating man, while Ace is always hiding behind Nicky. Speaking of Nicky, Joe Pesci gives, I think, an even better performance than in Goodfellas. His character doesn't look like much, but his acting makes him so much bigger. Also, the chemistry between the three is outstanding. For example, when Ace confronts Ginger after they leave the restaurant. You see Ace's absolute disgust of Ginger. And, when Nicky and Ace meet. Joe Pesci doesn't give 'forced anger' like so many other actors. The viewer feels like they are watching their conversation.",

However, I believe it is Scorcese's post-Goodfella's work that he should be commended for - excellent movies such as CAPE FEAR (1991), CASINO (1995) and GANGS OF NEW YORK (2002) have gone wholly unnoticed. While receiving 10 Academy Award nominations, GANGS OF NEW YORK didn't receive one and CAPE FEAR and CASINO were blatantly disregarded by the Academy - a gross oversight and disappointment to all Scorcese fans.

In some ways that is very true. She plays a gold-digging, druggie, drunk, hustling, whore. She is very glamorous in the film though, she is covered in beautiful gowns and jewelery that no guy could ever resist. Her first scene where Robert first sees her and she is stealing chips from a guy who has ""hired"" her for a night was extremely effective. You can see why Ace fell so hard for her. What a terrific performance in the end. When she screams at Ace ""I will go to the FBI! I will go to the police! I'm not protecting you anymore!"", you get scarred and can't help but watch more even though you are sitting on your butt for more than 2 1/2 hours.

Good lord this film is wasted potential. It's from one of my favourite directors and it has a great cast (hell even in this mess of a film the performances are pretty good), and the last Scorsese mob film is a contender for my favourite film of all time, and yet, this film was a near-complete waste of time. So what went wrong? Well, really this film suffered a death of a thousand cuts. I'll tell you this, the film certainly did not start out strong with opening credits that went on way too damn long and were quite dull, and on top of that even the music playing over the credits was sub-par. For that matter, I really didn't like a lot of the score/soundtrack for this film (in fact a few times I found the songs used rather distracting), which is saying something because this is a Martin Scorsese film and usually I love the soundtracks in his films, which brings me to this film's use of voice-over narration. As everyone and their mother knows, Martin Scorsese is usually very good at knowing how to use voice-over narration. Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, The Wolf of Wall Street, and the Irishman are all in my opinion films where voice-over is done brilliantly, so it pains me to say this voice-over in this film is terrible. For one thing, it's much too overused. Seriously, I was half an hour in and I think there had been like maybe 5 minutes where there wasn't a narrator talking. It does get better, but it's still overused. For another thing, I just didn't like the voice-over narration. Something about De Niro's voice I think, but I just didn't like it very much. This film gets compared a lot to Goodfellas, and while I can definitely see the basis of the comparison, Goodfellas is the far superior film. For example, while both films are rise-and-fall stories, Goodfellas does that job a lot better, whereas here I was left saying ""not much of a rise in this rise-and-fall story is there"", and even the fall was rather lacklustre. More than anything though, this film just really wasn't very interesting. It was extremely dull and I had to resist the urge to turn the damn thing off the entire time. What I liked about this film I didn't like that much, and what I disliked really really bothered me.",

Joe Pesci is Nicky Santorro, a rough-and-ready but nevertheless smart bully with his own gang ready to hit the jackpot in Vegas by robbing from every booky he can get his hands on and stealing jewelery from the rich gamblers.

While GoodFellas was mainly focused on a story full of gangsters in NYC, Casino tells us a story of them controlling those guys. It was very interesting and fascinating about how these people in Las Vegas running a Casino club and controlling the money and then fall from the heights of power when things start catching up to them.

With great attention to detail, great historical accuracy, and graphic realism that will make all but the most hardened movie- goers cringe, Scorcese delivers a full- throttle look at the mafia in Sin City before their fall in the mid- 80s. Definitely worth your time, if you can handle brutally realistic violence and non- stop profanity. The only thing that prevents this from getting a 10 out of 10 in my books is the fact that I personally found the character of Ginger, Rothstein's wife, to be slightly too prevalent, and to have received too much screen time.

It really felt like a community but then, that was the point of GoodFellas; that Henry Hill was being invited into a big family of sorts and that he would witness it's love and appeal but also it's horror and debauchery. Casino is more centred around 'Ace' Rothstein and Nicky Santoro. The secondary characters are there to provide their cog in the story and then go home. However, Casino has more grit and really conveys the pomp and greed surrounding the so-called ""high"" society of Vegas, not just the pathetic punters. It is also a benefit to hear of how the casinos work under the gaze of the Mob through the heavy use of voice-oveR. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are a fantastic double act and one cannot hide a certain envy towards Scorsese that he is able to wield the acting might of these two in his movies. Just seeing them having an argument is an acting tour de force (whatever that means, but I know it's positive). It's amazing that, like Temeura Morrison in 'Once Were Warriors', in that little scene with his son, Joe Pesci can make Nicky Santoro seem sympathetic. This must surely be the hallmark of a great actor. These are two actors at the top of their game under one of the greatest directors of all time, not just today. Enjoy. That said, Sharon Stone is as good as the madonna-cum-whore, Ginger, who starts the movie as a real figure in the world of gambling but ends up as a spiteful junkie, not even caring towards her child. I have not seen many of her films but I am sure that, just like Bruce Willis, if given the right roles or right director, she can act as good as the best of them. The supporting players such as; Don Rickles, James Woods, Kevin Pollack and L.Q. Jones manage to make their characters fresh and interesting in the time space given to them. The violence is one thing that people always comment on when it comes to this film. There is no doubt that it is pretty strong violence but what gets me is that the scene where Nicky stabs that man with the pen never gets a mention whereas the 'head-in-a-vice' scene always does. I see the pen scene as being a whole lot more graphic and shocking than the vice scene. This is because, with the vice scene, you get a couple of big warnings before hand so you know what will happen (also, the violence is more suggested, even though you can see what is happening to the victim, you do not see the gory details). With the pen scene, however, it takes you totally off guard. The close up of the pen entering the neck is more akin to Hostel than GoodFellas. It certainly took me off guard. What I want to talk about, finally, is the climax. Is it a climax? If so, it is a very played out climax. Maybe because it concerns the fates of several characters in the movie as opposed to just one big bad guy. Certainly Nicky's fate is drawn and bloody and the re-invention of Vegas is a part of that climax. It is a frank and final ending to the film and probably very fitting, as it shows us that crime doesn't pay for some people. In conclusion, I think that Casino is a definite Scorsese classic and one that should gain as much praise as his more lauded works. Despite some minor quibbles, it is up there with the better of Hollywood movies and hopefully will mature as time goes on rather than being regarded as the naughty younger brother of GoodFellas",
499,30 August 2003,ladiesman3383,10, Explosive and underrated,"You can sum this movie up in one word: explosive. Excellent directing by Martin Scorsese. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci once again deliver. The voice-overs work perfectly on De Niro, while Pesci gives the most explosive performance of the film, even better than he is in Goodfellas. Sharon Stone is perfect and should have won the Oscar. Amazingly, this film is the telling of a true story, based on Nick Pilleggi's novel. Great storytelling and the supporting cast is good,too. Scorsese doesn't use score, he uses source music, just like in Goodfellas. The use of source music fits in this story as it covers the 60's to the 80's. Underrated movie, although Stone was nominated, but nobody else, give me a break. Another thing I like, none of the acting is over-dramatic, they deal with the issues as they are.",

501,26 September 2019,JoshuaMHetu,9," A Worthy Follow-Up to ""Goodfellas""","""Casino"" is basically a spiritual sequel to ""Goodfellas"": Martin Scorsese reunites Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent to tell the tale of a mobster's violent rise and fall in 1970s America. ""Casino"" isn't quite as good as ""Goodfellas,"" but it's still a great movie in its own right. Scorsese, the master, avoids remaking ""Goodfellas"" by introducing new themes of doomed love and Catholic guilt that help to create a layered, engaging story. As he did before with New York City (and later with Boston) Scorsese uses the city of Las Vegas perfectly as a setting, portraying it as a sleepless town of bright lights and flashy cars ready to be taken advantage of by the American underworld. We experience the energy and excitement of the city's nightlife just as the characters do, and we understand why they'd want to escape to this lonely city in the desert where their dreams could come true - only for them to be dashed on the rocks of dirty money and broken relationships.",

It's the film that never sleeps. The characters interact on a 22/7 basis and maintains a strong atmospheric intensity throughout. The end though is much like that in Goodfellas, where all the top-men who know something end up getting wacked by the Mafia.

503,29 June 2012,matthewwalker50,9, Scorsese's most compelling drama,"Totally compelling to watch. Robert De Niro at 43 years of age packs his best performance since Goodfellas! I've always admired De Niro as an actor. His narrating, acting, and undeniable talent as an actor is there for all to see. It may not quite be the movie Goodfellas was. But, I'd put it 2nd best in the whole MOB Movie franchise. A strong, ambitious story about a multi-million dollar Casino deep in the lively city of Las Vegas set back in the year 1983. Mr Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (De Niro)is given the opportunity of a lifetime to take on the job of running the huge Tangiers Casino, the biggest casino in Las Vegas. He marries the beautiful sexy wildcard ""Ginger"" McKenna played by the gorgeous Sharon Stone who looks elegantly dazzling. Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) is Ace's bodyguard or ""Muscle"" if you like. His job is to make sure nobody messes around with the golden jewel. Later on Sam's relationship with Ginger totally disintegrates leaving Sam and their daughter Amy in an out of control situation with the circumstances resulting in the crazed Sharon Stone going on a rampage of madness until she finally gets arrested by an FBI agent and taken to jail. Nicky Santoro also has every FBI agent in the city watching him with great suspicion thinking he (which he was) behind multiple murder plots. The problem was that they always had to let Nicky go because there were never, ever any witnesses or evidence that he murdered these people. Very late on into the Movie near the end, Nicky and his brother (His closest friend) named Dominic are mercilessly & tenaciously beaten down in acres of cornfield around the desert of Las Vegas and buried alive in holes & filled with sand. The scene is excruciating to watch as the beating is realistic and extremely graphic to watch. Nicky's friend Frankie was responsible as he had basically just had enough of Nicky's evil behaviour and finally puts an end to his dominance. Frankie and his murder plot chums use wooden baseball bats and metal crowbars and whack Nick & his brother with them very hard. Seconds after Mr Rothstein faces a NDE as a bomb is planted under his car. Ace survives with minor burns thanks to a device under his seat that saved his life. He is seen on a stretcher being wheeled into an ambulance with the emergency docs saying ""You sure are lucky, mister."" Everyone should take precaution that this movie isn't for the faint of heart and contains incredibly graphic and realistic torture scenes that should not be watched by people who can't watch bloody scenes. Also there is around 600+ swear words including 430 uses of the infamous F-word including 3 racial slurs which should also be avoided if you dislike profanity. The Acting is absolutely outstanding and spot on though with a great cast, story, and director. Movie Tag: ""No one stays at the top forever""",
504,26 September 2002,ParaGreen,8, Hard stuff,"Very interesting gangster type film.  As good as anything else along these lines, if not better.  It reminded me a lot of the ""Godfather"" trilogy with the language and the killings.  If you like hearing all the versions of ""f***"" about every minute or two, sometimes three times in the same sentence, you'll enjoy this movie.  If you don't mind seeing about 30 or 40 guys getting wacked in the most bloody way conventionally possible, this movie will work for you.  To be fair though, that's what this story was all about so it had to be there.  If this movie is ever on TV, it's about as big a joke as putting on ""Scarface"" on TV.

We also recall Spilotro's crew, ""The Hole in the Wall Gang"" who, as depicted in the film, were notorious for jewelry store heists wherein their method of entry was, yes, drilling holes in the walls.

Oh, there's snatches of grand opera, too, especially when little Joe Pesci is killing someone. The point of all this music, presumably, is to punctuate with either emphasis or irony what we're seeing on the screen . . . An easy indicator that the director doesn't have much to show us. And in case that wasn't enough, Scorsese tries to fill the gaps with nonstop -- and I mean, NONSTOP -- voice-over narration. This may be one of the few movies a blind person could watch without missing anything. As cinema is a visual medium, I'm obviously not being complimentary to Mr. Scorsese, here. Scorsese keeps trying to outdo his earlier film with MORE narration, more walk-on characters, more gruesome violence (one guy gets his head squeezed in a vice), more domestic squabbling, more more more. But it's all meaningless, quite apart from being as boring as hell. What we have here is the story of small player from the Kansas City mob (Robert DeNiro) who wants to be a big player. His bosses send him to Vegas, where he feels he has a real opportunity to not only be a player, but to be ""legit"" in the bargain by becoming a real casino boss.",

Even though Chicago isn't specifically named (since at the time they still had power and Cullotta still had to watch his back) but if you know the story you know how good of a film it is. Of course they are going to take dramatic liberties as all films do but it's still close to what really happened. Even Frank Cullotta (Who's story it's based on) played a hitman in the film and did versions of the hits he participated with in real life. Pesci is fantastic as always. Sharon Stone as well. Only thing for me that was a source of annoyance was the accents. We from Chicago don't sound like NYC people. It's a harder accent to mimic than NYC but it is doable. Regardless Scorsese knocks it out of the park as usual.,

Martin Scorsese's fascinating film ""Casino"" knows a lot about the Mafia's relationship with Las Vegas. It's based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi, who had full access to a man who once ran four casinos for the mob, and whose true story inspires the movie's plot. As IMDb rightly puts it it is a film of greed , money , power and most importantly deception. In terms of acting De Niro steals the show as 'Sam Rothstein' as well as Sharon Stone who also portrays a very convincing performance. I believe the explanation of how 'Rothstein' runs the Casino are the most intriguing scene's of the whole film (as in how it is shot and acted) with De Niro giving us an 'in absolute character' performance. My only dislike for the film is what most people have recognised when watching it and that is it's similarity to 'Goodfellas' ( characters and narrative) and the fact that Joe Pesci plays the same little angry Italian everytime but this pales in comparison to the positives. Ultimately , having of finally watched this film after years of wanting to i regard it as one of the best of that decade and recommend it highly.",

And excellent use of voice-over narration by the different characters.

And the performances? How about the killer soundtrack?? As unintelligent as it may sound, the only knock I can imagine on this film from the aficionados would have to be the lack of violence when compared to say, Pulp Fiction, but I definitely think that there is ample blood and guts, but the gratuitous violence is actually (and this is rare) overshadowed by the depth of the art going on here, and this is the mark of greatness within this genre. Also, the editorial-stype commentary in the last 3 minutes was a bit heavy-handed, but nothing that would detract from a deserved 10/10 rating. Thoughts??",

Her fight scenes with DeNiro are jaw-dropping in their intensity.
There can be too much of a good thing, and this movie proves it. Better editing could have made it a true classic, but it drags at points and brings in too many secondary characters, thus losing focus. It's worth watching, but it's not for the squeamish or for those with short attention spans.",

It was much worse than what Scorcese is capable of at the top of his game, however, which makes it watchable. Dancing around the theme of redemption, like so many Scorcese films, it tells of Ace Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a crook trying to redeem himself and go straight, and who ends up running a fancy casino. Awesome, right? Wrong. He falls in love with a hooker (Ginger), marries her, and then his best friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci, playing a trigger-happy psycho for once!) comes and wants his share of what Vegas has to offer. Except Nicky's not even trying to go straight. Ginger ends up an abusive, cheating junkie bitch on wheels, and Nicky, by virtue of his relations with Ace, ends up messing Ace's life up in a big way. A main theme in this movie is trust - Ace begins with saying there can be no love without trust, and by the end it turns out Ace shouldn't have trusted anybody. Robert De Niro gave a pretty good performance - nothing compared, of course, to Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, or The King of Comedy - but he is from head to toe a fundamentally good guy with his head on right, who in fact tends to live too much in his head until he crashes for Ginger. He recovers quickly enough, though, and although he isn't perfect, we want him to win. One of the interesting points of the performance is that even though Ace is so logical and tough, when he gets hurt it's unbearable. Joe Pesci was OK, nothing compared to his performance in Raging Bull of course, and while I'm tempted to say Sharon Stone was awful she wasn't that bad. In my opinion Scorcese was a lot better before all the expensive sets and frou-frou camera-work. It just gets in the way of his message. I guess ultimately it's about how your life adds up at the end of the day, and how you can escape your past. It's got a very Catholic tone to it with respect to absolution - it seems to convey the thought that if you're just sorry enough for your sins, everything will work out.",

I know that this is his style, but I don't enjoy it. More to add, I can say, that I actually didn't like any of his films truly. I know, that he shows us true history of the scum of America. And most of this scum is American-Italian-Jewish mafia. I also understand, that most of these movies are based on real events, but I can't do anything about it. I HATE GANGSTERS. I HATE CRIMINALS. If somebody find it stylish, then I can't comment this. I'm not that kind of people that will enjoy THAT level of violence, depicted in this movie, because all, the people care in this movie is MONEY. MONEY -is the worst thing invented by human. This is why they kill, torture and humiliate other people. This is the thing I will NEVER understand and AGREE...

Anyways I was reluctant to see this film because some people say its just another Goodfellas or Scorsese is trying to hard to rekindle the magic from his 1990 masterpiece. But this did not disappoint. Robert De Niro gave, in my opinion, his best performance yet and Sharon Stone was great, although psychotic near the end. Now on to Joe Pesci. While he was great in Goodfellas, he was sometimes annoying in Casino. I'm not offended by profanity, but just about every other word out of his mouth is the F word. His performance in Casino was good, but doesn't beat Tommy in Goodfellas.",

Many consider Casino to be the sequel to Goodfellas. I completely agree with this, and for many reasons. And, if this truly is a sequel, I believe that Casino is the greatest sequel in the history of film-making. And I believe that Casino is better than Goodfellas, but not by much. This film is very in depth about the lives of gangsters and how casinos are managed. Parts of Casino feel like a documentary. Robert De Niro delivers one of his best performances as Ace. Sharon Stone is unbelievably believable as Ginger, who drastically changes as the film continues. Joe Pesci steels the movie yet again, playing Nicky, who acts very similar to the character that he played in Goodfellas. The lighting is beautiful and very shiny. Scorsese pulled it off once again.

It of course also involves the mob. If you enjoyed Scorsese's Gooddellas then you'll love this film. It is directed in a similar style to that of Goodfellas and of course has Deniro and Joe Pesci in it. And yes it features great first person narration like that of Goodfellas. The best performances in the movie come from Sharn Stone, the uptight weasel-y wife of Deniro's character, and the best performance goes to the ultra slippery snake weasel character played by James Woods. And in the spirit of Scorsese, expect to hear a lot of great music numbers throughout.

Even Sharon Stone is the only one of the three that doesn't come through for me. I do find it funny though that so many of these guys end up in the same gangster movies, do they even have to read the script anymore. Even with that said I do enjoy these films a lot and I hope they keep making them. I would like to see a new mob movie come out. The Sapronos is a good guide but even still I don't know how Deniro would deal with somebody like Tony Saprano.

Taking place in the early 1980s, two mob friends, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, are put in charge of a Las Vegas casino. Their job? To make certain everything runs smooth and to make sure that the bosses get their black bag of money. What happens? To put it into a short context: things start to fall apart. The dysfunction represented in this movie is amazing, every little thing leads to something worse. The beginning shows the rise of the Mafia's empire in Las Vegas: from the towering casinos to the floors of the casino, you get a little taste of everything in here. What's really interesting is that if you played by the rules, they treated you like gold, but if you double crossed them things could get pretty ugly (see the hammer scene). Casino, put simply, is a great movie. The only problem I experienced was that there were parts that seemed to drag out. The movie weighs in at a hefty 2hrs and 59min so don't expect to go anywhere soon. If you haven't see this yet then give it a chance, it really is a great movie.",

LV is now (as the movie observes) another Disneyland, but I know someone who just returned from another part of NV, and she has assured me that there are still ""a lot of holes in the desert"".

But i just think this a classic , truthful tale of power and greed and i don't think it is like Goodfellas, despite what people think. Every movie with gangsters in it will have the same kind of characters because that is the characters the mob is filled with, smart ones, raging bulls, good earners etc. There is a Nickey character in every mob, a hard raging machine that you just don't mess with because he will fly off the handle, their is someone like his boss Remo who seems calm and cool but was the most important man in the mob and he just needs to push a button and thats it lights out, then there are good earners like Ace who may not be Italian and cant be made, but they are around because they are useful and smart and great at making money for them.

Scorsese's fantastic writing and directing brings this great script to life. Every actor kills it in their roles and they play of each other in such a great way. The movie has amazing cinematography making the scenes so much more dynamic. The only real problem with this film is it's similarity to Goodfellas. A lot of the plot points and characters can be directly compared to Goodfellas even down to the casting. This does make the movie feel less unique as a result. I also feel that the movie has a hard time with concluding each characters story in the end. These flaws still don't ruin the movie because everything else is so well made.,

Casino takes many chances with the plot but it is wonderfully voiced-over by Ace and Nicky Santoro (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci). I believe the voice-overs makes Casino interesting because it feels as if we are eavesdropping in a secret place.

Casino is only slightly inferior to Raging Bull, Taxi Driver being altogether the best, but Casino takes Scorsese back to his roots : the Mafia, although instead of having his native city New York as a setting, this time he chooses Las Vegas, with the casinos and (obviously) the cash. The story is roughly based on true authentic anecdotes from the 70s. It's about a master of gambling, Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert de Niro), hired by the Mafia to control a casino, the Tangiers. He meets and marries a respected prostitute, Ginger (Sharon Stone), and one of his old friends, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), comes into town.

604,1 April 2023,esellecooney,9, All betting aside - better than Goodfellas,Goodfellas is a great film. It has quotable lines and we all know that Pesci stole more of that film than was taken by De Niro and Liotta in the Lufthansa plot. Casino offers so much more. It is like being on a rollercoaster and the minute you get on it is thrilling and terrifying in equal measure. It also has the most stunning performance by Sharon Stone as Ginger - her derailment is heartbreaking. Pesci's demise is brutal but actually more believable than in Goodfellas. De Niro is the quiet man of the film - doing what he does best - the small knowing looks and frustrations. I have only watched this twice - it has stayed with me and if you have not seen it yet - watch it - keep a cushion with you just in case though.,
605,24 November 2006,achilles_nation15,10, Not just a violent movie,"Casino has to definitely be in my top ten favorite movies. But why does everyone say it's so violent. I'll ask someone ""What did you think of Casino?"" and they'll say it was violent. They never say whether it was good or bad, they'll just say it was violent. Other then the scene involving the baseball bats, the movie is not all that bad. I thought movie's like Scarface and Goodfellas were a lot worse then this. It is really unjust to watch this movie, which had great acting, a good story and an awesome soundtrack and say it was just violent. If you thought this movie was violent, then you should not watch any of Scorsese's movies. This movie should be in the top 100.",

I cannot believe this was not rated higher. **Pay attention to the fabulous lighting in this film**- Especially how Sam (Ace) is lit whenever he is in the Casino. *He is shown with a very bright light directly over him, making him appear god-like. Notice how Sam is lit much differently when he is in his home with Ginger, showing he does not have full control and does not have his god-like status there as he does in the Casino. **Trivia**: ** DID YOU KNOW... that the ""Tangiers"" Casino hotel (as they call the casino in the film) Was based on the Sands? **DID YOU KNOW*... *...That Casino is based on a true story and a lot of the names weren't changed. **Major film Inconsistency*: in the first scene, Sam is shown flying from his car in the car-bomb explosion but later when they show how it actually happened, he gets out of the car just as it's blowing up and is never blown out of it at at all.",

There's a scene early in the movie where Ginger and Ace are in their apartment. There's a brief shot through the window in the background before is goes to a close up on Ginger. If you watch that window, you can see the Stratosphere in the background. The movie is supposed to take place in 1973. However, the Stratosphere was built less than a decade ago. Way to go filming guys! So yeah, anyone else catch that?",

Also great scenes which shows the reality Robert De Niro is the best option for that. Joe Pesci also performed very well in playing role of an eccentric caring money freak. Sharon Stone is beautiful, selfish whore who will do anything for money Movie is going straight not too much twist but the performances dialogues and direction is awesome.

626,22 June 2005,ScrippsHoward313,10, My Take On Casino,"I really like the movie because it is high in impact!!! Some would classify the movie as 'Crime Drama', but no offense, I found it to be somewhat hilarious for two reasons... One, how the intense gestures are approached and two, the ways that these people swear in this movie. That's how I see it!!! The truth though, I also thought it was very touchy and very addictive. I consider it to be my new favorite movie!!! Naturally, I also consider it to be 'Crime Drama' at its finest since it is a Martin Scorsese film. It's 100% high-impact, 100% eye-popping, 100% fun to watch and on top of that, 100% pure adrenaline rush!!! I sincerely recommend that everybody go buy the 10th anniversary edition on DVD in stock now at Wal-Mart or any other video store!!!",

628,13 September 2005,winst-1,10," Use keywords: "" honest casinos "" to find the trustworthy online casinos in the world","Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again. What an incredible movie! This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in. Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch a lot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold. Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker. Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career. Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it. This film is truly a gem you don't find often.",
629,20 December 2005,bengriffiths513,9, good film,"Casino is by almost all standards a great film. Its got a great ensemble cast,Sharon Stone gives one of the best performances iv seen by her and *obviously De Niro and Pesci are great. The film follows a rise and fall structure just like Goodfellas, which is probably why people are comparing them, and it follows the story of Ace Rothstein(De Niro) running a casino in Las Vegas which is under control by the mob. Aces operations in Nevada are put into jeopardy by the behaviour of his wife (stone) and Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) and many elements contribute to a kind of decline for Ace.",
630,17 January 2006,david99-3,9, Casino,"I first hear about casino at www.best-on-line-casinos.com , Everything is going well when the casino is going well. The mob got large bags of money each day so they could evade taxes. But as the film progresses the bags get progressively smaller. It becomes difficult to convince them that money counters who skim off the top are just going to steal some for themselves too. Suspicion abounds and bad times are ahead. Dinero has troubles with his wife. Joe Pesci stabs someone who insults the casino boss in one scene and sets out to dispose of the body. although The script & directing are not perfect.. their combination make great mix and very enjoyable movie! Go to see Casino! recommended!!",
