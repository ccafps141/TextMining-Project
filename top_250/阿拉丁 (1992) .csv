0,23 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, I'd put it in with the Disney classics,"Aladdin is such an awesome move that still gets me excited to this day, I remember when I was 7 and I saw this in the theater and I just had so much fun. I am such a dork, I still love a lot of the Disney movies that I loved as a kid, but I think the reason that I love Aladdin so much is because this is one of the last Disney movies that was hand drawn animation, the reason I love hand drawn animation is because it feels more personal and that the crew put their heart and soul into it, you can tell by watching it. They got a great cast of voice actors including Scott Weinger from Full House and the always entertaining and hilarious Robin Williams. Robin was just a perfect choice for Genie, he brought a lot of energy to the movie and makes the genie a great character. Who knew that a kid's version of the Arabian Nights tale could be so great? This is a great Disney movie that I guarantee you're going to love.",/
1,23 October 2004,Boba_Fett1138,9," Great songs and a good villain make ""Aladdin"" a Disney classic.","This movie has three elements that are important for an animated Disney movie: Great songs, a good villain and a great sidekick.",r
2,12 January 2007,ccthemovieman-1,10," Robin Williams, Great Songs Make This One Of The Best Animated Films Ever","I can think of three quick reasons why this has remained one of the best animated movies ever: 1 - Very good, very catchy songs that still sound good 15 years later; 2 - excellent, colorful visuals; 3 - the unique humor of Robin Williams, who seems to spout a joke-a- second. In fact, you have to pay close attention to hear Williams' lines because they come so fast and furious. Actually, at times they are too fast. You hardly have time to laugh or digest what he just said when another line hits you. Williams' genie character doesn't appear on screen until after the first third of the film is over.",e
3,19 December 2011,ElMaruecan82,10, Forever a favorite of mine ...,"I will never forget the first time I watched ""Aladdin"", I was with a group of friends waiting in the airport for the plane that would take us from Orlando to Paris at the time when ""Aladdin"" was the 'big thing' in the USA while some previews of ""The Lion King"" were starting to screen. ""Aladdin"" will forever be associated to that wonderful week I spent in Disneyland, and it's only fitting if the movie is my favorite Disney film, slightly edging-out ""The Jungle Book"".",v
4,5 September 2001,aesgaard41,10, Vintage Robin Williams,"I did not care to see this movie, but I was such a big Robin Williams that I rented it long after it stopped playing in the theaters. From the first few scenes I was spellbound by the voices and the script.I can still mimmick nearly all of the Genie's themes as well as see myself play Aladdin in a live action version of this movie with Paula Abdul as Jasmine and John De Lancie as Jafar. Jasmine in this movie has the same sexual innocence as Ariel the Little Mermaid and Krysta of Fern Gully. The songs are infectious, especially ""Friend Like Me"" and ""A Whole New World."" The whole movie is one big roller coaster ride augmented by the raucous wit of Robin Williams and his own talent for mimmicry and improvisation. Ten Stars way up!",i
5,17 February 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10, Aladdin is a beautifully constructed film. that is for me one of Disney's best!,"Aladdin is a brilliant movie. Sure, it isn't as good as Beauty and the Beast, but I think it is definitely one of my favourite Disney movies. It is beautifully constructed, with some of the best animation sequences of recent times. The music score is just delightful. How can I ever forget the animated sequence to ""A Whole New World?"" Perfect. Jafar is one of Disney's finest villains, voiced with relish by Jonathan Freeman. Unfortunately, like Shere Kahn, he was another Disney villain that was ruined by a DTV sequel. Aladdin and Jasmine's romance is so believable, and while people have said they are bland, they do appeal to you soon enough. And for me Jasmine along with Esmeralda is one of the sexiest female Disney characters. I actually found it hard to tell what was computer animated, whereas there have been some movies that make a mess of that. I want to guess what is computer animated. The best aspect of this movie, is a hilarious performance from Robin Williams as the Genie If he hadn't ad-libbed so many of his lines, the script could have won an Oscar- that said his genie was a perfect match and fitted with the story very well. Some people say the movie starts off slow. But with the songs and animation, that really isn't an issue. The movie also spawned the best DTV sequel, the King of Thieves. 10/10. Bethany Cox",e
6,7 February 2001,grahamsj3,7, Hilarious,"I think this is one of the funniest films that Disney has ever done. This is due entirely to Robin William's brilliant voice of the Genie. He is wonderful in this role. I think the animation is pretty fair although I dislike the ""generic"" people that Disney's shop is putting out these days. They all share the same basic facial structure and eyes, so there is not much difference between any of the characters. It's not like Sleepy, Doc and Sneezy, who all looked very different. Still, this is a great and funny film. It is totally clean and not very violent so it is appropriate for every member of the family. Give this one a try and you'll have a great time watching it!",w
7,15 January 2006,dcldan,8, Fantastic!,"Magic, adventures, laughs, love... This film has everything mixed, and the result is quite good! The film is about the classic tale of ""Aladdin and the magic lamp"", so the story is well known by everybody. Despite it is for children, the quality of the characters is very good, the story, though predictable and typical, results interesting and, which is more important, it males us to spend a good hour and a half. The songs (typical in Disney) never are boring, and are surprisingly well mixed with images. In addition, action scenes are well ended and most characters are very charismatic. Aladdin is sympathetic form the beginning and most secondary characters are simply perfect. The ""acting"" of the Genius is superb in his strangeness and absurd, and Yafar is well remembered as one of the ""best"" bad ones of the history of cinema. It exhales an immense aura of evilness hardly ever seen in a movie... To sum up, one of the best (maybe the best) Disney film made, which everything to have a nice afternoon with your children or just spending a nice time laughing and remembering when you were a child.",/
8,24 July 2007,Atreyu_II,8, A whole new world. A new fantastic point of view...,"The 31st animated Disney classic is one of Disney's best known movies. It also takes us to a whole new world, a new fantastic point of view. This one takes place in Saudi Arabia. I've always liked this movie.",r
9,13 May 2005,British_Aussie_chick,10, This film is so good!,"I grew up watching this film and along with Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella it is one of my favourite Disney films. I love it! Robin Williams is so good in it. He's hilarious. This film isn't just for kids but for the whole family. I think I was about 5 when I first saw it and at 14 I still watch it and so do my parents. I haven't seen the sequels because I heard that Robin Williams wasn't in them and decided that they wouldn't be as good without him. He was made for the part. The songs are amazing. I love singing along to ""A Whole new World"". I'm hoping to get the soundtrack soon. I also love the film because I have the same name as the princess in it! I would definitely recommend it to everyone. You're never too old to watch a classic Disney film.",w
10,3 October 2020,Xstal,9, 'Wake up and smell the hummus'...,"... or falafel or baba ghanoush, they all smell and taste outstanding, as outstanding as this piece of delicious and delightful Disney animation that gives satisfaction to the most devouring of cinephiles appetites. The cherry on the cake being the unique and brilliant voice of the genie, the voice of a true entertainer and genieus, the voice of the unforgettable, the one and only - Robin Williams. It just so happens to have an endearingly beautiful story as well.",5
11,2 March 2001,mattkratz,9," great work, Robin!","Robin Williams is marvelous as the genie. Try to keep up! True, the film gets a little stereotypical and formulaic. But the energy and story will keep you entertained. The usual be yourself message at the end can be found just about anywhere, but I'm sure you won't mind.",7
12,11 October 2013,ironhorse_iv,8," Aladdin grant the fan's wishes, by being a great film. A whole new world.","Aladdin is a key piece to the comeback of Disney. Before Aladdin, Disney was still struggling after a long period of fail animated block-busters films. The biggest blow to the company, came in 1981's The Fox and the Hound when long-time animator Don Bluth left Disney, taking 11 Disney animators with him. Disney came back with 1989's Little Mermaid and 1991's Beauty and the Beast, but with the success of Aladdin, Disney spark the era known as the Disney Renaissance, that continue until the early 2000's. These film restore public and critical interest back into Disney. Aladdin was a very controversial choice for a kid's movie when it came out. Aladdin is based on the Arab folktale of Aladdin and the magic lamp. It's still unknown if Aladdin is not actually part or not part of the 1001 Arabian Nights stories. The tale of Aladdin was somewhat violence and had various forms of erotica. The original story had Aladdin, with the help of his magical ring full of Djin, kidnapped Jasmine on her honeymoon. How romantic, a kidnapping movie! Glad, they change the plot somewhat from the original tale. One of the verses of the opening song ""Arabian Nights"" in the film had to be altered following protests from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) due to its violence lyrics about cutting ears. There is also protest raise by another scene where Aladdin is mistaken by critics due to the line, 'Good Kitty, take off' which the critics thought he was saying 'Good teenagers, take off your clothes'. Because of the controversy, Disney replaced the phrase with ""Down, kitty"" on the DVD release. People have also took noticed with the similarities between Aladdin and Richard Williams's film The Thief and the Cobbler AKA The Princess and the Cobbler (1993). Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief and the Cobbler, The Thief and the Cobbler was started much earlier in the 1960s, so they have been dispute who rip off who even up to today. The film story is about Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weigner) a poor but kind-hearted Agrabah thief who finds himself arrested for thievery. Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman) promise him a reward in return for retrieving the lamp from the Cave of Wonders, a mysterious magical cave. Jafar tries to betray him for the lamp, and Aladdin find himself trapped in the collapsed cave. In the collapsed cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unexpectedly unleashing Genie (Voiced by Robin Williams), who reveals he will grant Aladdin three wishes. Seeing this as his way out, Aladdin created a new life as Prince Ali to get closer to the princess Jasmine (voice by Linda Larkin). Jafar starts to question Prince Ali believing him as the poor thief that he betrayed and start to make plans to steal the lamp once and for all. The movie has a great message for the children about being yourself and not allow yourself to be imprisoned. Glad they didn't go with the Greed is good message. The animation is great. Even today, I have to say when the Cave of Wonders, Sand Tiger come alive, it brings chills down my neck. The magic carpet ride through the cave was collapsing was intense. I can't help thinking of those scenes, even now. The music to the film is ground breaking good to hear. Composer Alan Menken and songwriters Howard Ashman and Tim Rice were praised for creating a soundtrack that is amazing. I love 'A Whole New World'. One of the best love songs of the 1990's. It has an amazing melody that complements the scenery very well. I too love how the song speeds up, giving it a very romantic yet magical and adventurous feel to it. The other songs like 'Friends like me', 'Street Rat', 'One Jump Ahead' and 'Prince Ali' also work. I do have to say the 2004, Special Edition released kinda ruin it, by having a new song ""Proud of Your Boy"", performed by Clay Aiken which I thought was mediocre. Now there has been a couple of fan theories that goes with this film, that I like to address like The Merchant is the Genie. Both look very similar, and it seems to make sense because Robin Williams voices both characters. Another variation of this same theory says the man made the whole story up to sell the lamp, so Aladdin wasn't really a true story. The last theory is the most outlandish. Some people think that Aladdin takes place in a Post- Apocalyptic future where technological marvels had been long forgotten and been taking as magic. Some critics even think the Magic Carpet is a time- traveling device. The Genie proves this theory by making impressions of ancient, long-dead celebrities like Groucho Marx, and Jack Nicholson. Still, it can make sense that the Genie is an all-powerful being who can see into the future, so he can make jokes like those, but why would he make jokes that Aladdin wouldn't get. The truth is, Robin Williams was making cultural references jokes to get more people to see the film. Much of Robin Williams' dialogue was ad-libbed and it was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters for animation to work on. It was no surprised that the film has so many in-jokes impersonality as Robin is known for that at the time. This was a new type of Disney humor that wasn't in much kids movies at the time. Disney would later use this type of humor in other animation films like 2001's Emperor New Groove, and 1997's Hercules. In an odd way, Aladdin also take place in the same period as Hercules, so a crossover was used in later projects. Check out, Disney's first direct-to-video sequel, 1994's The Return of Jafar and the TV Show. 1996's Aladdin and the King of Thieves was OK so check it. Overall: Aladdin is a great nostalgia movie that takes us back to when we were kids. Worth watching.",6
13,11 January 2006,taeweth,10, Great movie!,"Simply a classic. The movie Aladdin is hilariously told with many many MANY funny moments. The genie his an all-time high in this classic film about a street rat and a princess. A great movie for young kids, but even adults will love the wonderfully amusing lines throughout the story. ",2
14,15 June 2005,mig28lx,8," Random Thoughts on ""Aladdin""","Just watched this recently, on the new-and-improved DVD which features a restored print, and it looks spectacular. The story is slightly shallower than the best of Disney's films, but this is balanced by the sheer lunacy of Robin Williams' bad, blue Genie. Whoever first thought of putting Robin Williams in a Disney flick should get a Pulitzer, or a Nobel, or something. The comic timing of his riffs combined with the comic timing of the animators transform the Genie from a ""Deus Ex Machina"" into the soul of ""Aladdin.""",8
15,18 January 2006,Lady_Targaryen,8, Imagine if you had three wishes....,"Aladdin is one of my favorite movies from Disney, and when I watched it for the first time I was 7 years old. Aladdin is a poor boy and he lives at the streets with his best friend Abu, a little and cute monkey. One day, at the market, he helps Princess Jasmine thinking that she is a regular girl,but under Jafar's orders (sultan's adviser)Aladdin is thrown in jail.Jasmine stays furious with Jafar's orders, but Jafar being an evil bastard, says to her that he asked to kill Aladdin. But many things that Jafar didn't think become true, and one of them is that Aladdin escaped from prison, and is the only person who can enter in a cave where the magical lamp is.(I don't need to say that he is the one who takes the lamp and become Genie's friend) But many things will happen, including Aladdin and Jasmine's meet as prince and princess.",2
16,17 April 2005,suspiria10,7, S10 Reviews: Aladdin (1992),"Disney animation strikes pay dirt again with ""Aladdin"". Aladdin is an orphaned ""street rat"" who, with his cheeky monkey Abu takes what they need to survive the harsh reality of their situation. All with a song in his heart. But Aladdin gets mixed up in a nefarious plot by Jafar (and his hilariously funny foul-mouth parrot Iago) the adviser to the sultan. Like most of the cinematic madmen Jafar has hatched up a glorious scheme to bring the world to its knees but there is a catch. A person pf pure spirit is the only one who can grab a mystical lamp which is the heart of his plan. When things go wrong for Jafar (thanks to that quick monkey) Aladdin discovers the secret of the lamp and the comic hilarity that lay inside. Aladdin gets three wishes from the *ahem* Genie in the bottle (voiced by the perfectly cast Robin Williams) and Al's life will never be the same. Will Aladdin fulfill his deepest desires or will he rescue the princess and take a magic carpet ride into the sunset? ""Aladdin"" is a beautiful melding of computer generated and standard animation that paved the way for Disney's best feature (The Lion King). Wonderfully magical story with some seriously crazy comedians at work, ""Aladdin"" is great fun for the whole family.",9
17,21 January 2021,mark.waltz,10, This out beauties the beast.,"It's a shame that voice acting has never been honored at the Academy other than personal recognition for their talents because Robin Williams certainly deserved an Oscar for his work here. Once you start to get used to the Broadway style voices for these middle eastern characters, you can truly enjoy this, and that's pretty much my only gripe about my favorite modern Disney animated musical.",/
18,2 June 2018,classicsoncall,7," ""You ain't never had a friend like me!""","No question Robin Williams delivers in a trademark role here as the wise cracking, ad-libbing Blue Genie, but I also got a kick out of Gilbert Gottfried's voice work for Iago the Parrot. And that's saying something, because otherwise, in a take it or leave it situation with Gottfried, I'd always leave it. The story is classic Disney, colorful and song filled, with an interesting balance of villains and heroes. The back and forth with the magic lamp gets a little played out after a while, but I thought the ending had an ironic twist with Sorceror Jafar (Jonathan Freeman) wishing to be the most powerful genie in the world. In effect, he got double whammied by the law of unintended consequences and a severe lesson in 'be careful what you wish for'.",?
19,30 September 1999,Spleen,8, One of Disney's weaker recent efforts,"`Aladdin' caused a few ripples of shock in animation circles.  It seemed that Disney had started to pick up some tricks from Warner Brothers, like the rapid-fire topical references and Hollywood-star-of-the-day caricature. Most people were pleased.  It's orthodoxy in animation circles that the Warner Brothers style is a great one, much more lively than Disney's.",r

22,23 March 2009,moonspinner55,6," Lots of color and pep, good songs but derivative elements...","Arabian Nights tale via the Disney people, presented in the much-missed, regrettably vanquished hand-drawn era of animation. The Sultan's daughter must marry a prince in three days or be forced to wed her father's version of a concierge, who drips with disdain and evil; meanwhile, young rogue Aladdin and his pet monkey have been allowed into a hallowed cave of treasures where they rescue a manic genie from a magic lamp. In-jokes aside, the movie visually borrows from other Disney product (particularly ""Sleeping Beauty"" towards the end), not to mention ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". It doesn't seem to have much spirit of its own apart from Robin Williams and his vocal hamming (which was seen as a tour-de-force in its time). There are funny bits and pieces, beautiful designs and scene transitions, and the romance between the young people comes off well. It's a little screechy and a little staid, with illogical rewrites to the Aladdin legend which do nothing but prolong the inevitable; however, the Disney magic is in evidence and the film is satisfying on a non-think level. **1/2 from ****",_
23,30 October 2013,OllieSuave-007,5, Not very timeless.,"I believe this is the first of the more recent full-length animated feature films to lose the ""Disney touch."" For some good points first, the animation is great and story had potential, about a poor street urchin named Aladdin who meets a princess in disguise, the palace-fatigued Jasmine, on the streets. They fell in love with each other afterward, but the only problem is that Princess Jasmine can only marry a prince according to palace standards. Thrown in the mix is the evil vizier Jafar, who wants to control the land, and the slapstick Genie of the Lamp. And, the music is great - ""A Whole New World"" is breathtaking and ""One Jump Ahead"" is very catchy.",=
24,29 December 2016,Hitchcoc,10, A Story With Teeth and Great Songs,"This is part of the Disney winning streak of wonderful animated films. It is the familiar story of the young boy who finds a magic lamp that allows him to converse with a genie. What an amazing choice for the genie as Robin Williams struts his stuff. The genie is the star of this show, but a good villain is also thrown in there. As they battle Jaffar, Aladdin is forced to use all his resources to become what he was intended to be. He must somehow become worthy to marry the princess. He is seen as a poser because of his humble upbringing. He woos her with the song ""A Whole New World,"" which is an apt title for what he has to offer. The best animated features have an edge to them, and this is no exception. The animation is fabulous and the story is well conceived.",t
25,15 June 2005,jboothmillard,10, Aladdin,"I remember this being one of the first films I would have seen at the cinema as a child, and became a favourite of mine from Walt Disney Pictures numerous times on video. Basically, a merchant (Robin Williams) welcomes the audience to Agrabah, shows a lamp for sale, and starts to tell a tale. Power-hungry Jafar (Jonathan Freeman), the Grand vizier of the Sultan of Agrabah (Douglas Seale) is seeking a lamp hidden in the Cave of Wonders (an opening shaped as the head of a tiger). The only person who can enter the cave is the one worthy known as ""the diamond in the rough"". On the streets of Agrabah, street urchin Aladdin (Scott Weinger) and his pet monkey Abu (Frank Welker) dream of a better life. In the palace, the beautiful Princess Jasmine (Linda Larkin) is upset that law dictates she must marry a prince, and not for love. With the help of her pet tiger Rajah she escapes the palace and meets Aladdin. Jafar and his parrot assistant Iago (Gilbert Gottfried) find out that Aladdin is the ""diamond in the rough"", so he orders the palace guards to find him. The guards, led by captain Razoul (Jim Cummings) arrest Aladdin on the charge of kidnapping. Jasmine confronts Jafar, wanting Aladdin to be released, but he lies to her saying that he has been executed. Disguised as an old man, Jafar frees Aladdin and Abu, proposing to find the cave, and receive a reward for retrieving the lamp. Inside the cave, after being told not to touch anything but the lamp, they find a magical carpet, which helps them to locate the lamp. Aladdin takes the lamp, but Abu touches a jewel, causing the cave to collapse, the carpet races back to the entrance. Aladdin passes Jafar the lamp, throws him and Abu back into the cave, as it disappears into the sand, but Jafar is devastated to find the lamp is missing. Trapped in the cave, Abu hands Aladdin the lamp, which he stole back. Aladdin rubs the lamp, and inadvertently releases the Genie (Robin Williams) inside, who grants him three wishes. Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing them from the cave without using a wish. Aladdin asks Genie what he would wish for, and Genie explains that he is a prisoner of the lamp, and only his master can wish him free. After Aladdin promises to use his third wish to set Genie free, he uses his first wish to become a prince to woo Jasmine. In the palace, Iago suggests to Jafar he could become Sultan by marrying Jasmine. Outside the palace, a large parade introduces Aladdin, as ""Prince Ali Ababwa"". The Sultan is excited to meet him and to introduce him to Jasmine, Jafar is displeased, while Jasmine is angered overhearing their conversation about her fate. The Genie suggests Aladdin should tell the truth and be himself, but Aladdin believes Jasmine would reject him and is determined to remain a prince. Aladdin asks Jasmine to give him a chance, she recognises him from their previous encounter, but he denies they know each other. He eventually persuades her to give him a chance and takes her on a magic carpet ride to see the world. Jasmine deceives Aladdin into revealing his true identity, but he claims he dresses as a peasant to escape palace life, which she accepts. After returning to the palace, Aladdin and Jasmine share a kiss, before Aladdin is captured by the guards and thrown into the sea. The Genie is let out of the lamp and saves Aladdin, at the cost of his second wish. Aladdin returns to the palace and exposes Jafar's manipulation of the Sultan, through hypnotism. Jafar manages to flee, but not before spotting the lamp and deducing Aladdin's identity. Fearing the idea that he will be one day become Sultan, and fearing he will be exposed, Aladdin breaks his promise and tells Genie he cannot free him. When Aladdin is distracted, Iago steals the lamp, Jafar becomes Genie's new master and wishes to become Sultan. Jasmine refuses to bow to him, so Jafar uses his second wish to become the most powerful sorcerer in the world. He uses his newfound powers to expose Aladdin and throw him into the snowy wilderness. But Aladdin manages to get back to the palace using Carpet. Aladdin fights with Jafar to get back the lamp, with Jafar tranforming into a gigantic snake. Aladdin taunts Jafar for being less powerful than the Genie, tricking Jafar into using his last wish to become an all-powerful genie himself. Now bound to his new lamp, Jafar ends up trapped inside it, taking Iago with him. While Agrabah is returned to normal, Genie launches Jafar's lamp into the distant desert. Genie suggests using his last wish to become a prince again so he can be with Jasmine, but he instead chooses to wish Genie free. After watching his actions, the Sultan decides to change the law, allowing the princess to marry whoever she deems worthy. Genie says his goodbyes to see the world, while Aladdin and Jasmine start their new life together. Williams (who won a Special Award at the Golden Globes for his vocal work) is pure genius as the eccentric and highly hilarious Genie, with his superb celebrity impressions (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Peter Lorre, Robert De Niro, Rodney Dangerfield, Jack Nicholson) and energetic vocals. The animation is fantastic, the story is fun and entertaining, and the songs are catchy and memorable, two sequels (The Return of Jafar and King of Thieves) and a cartoon TV series followed, but this is the one that is perfect for all the family, a brilliant animated musical fantasy comedy. It won the Oscars for Best Original Score for Alan Menken, and Best Original Song for ""A Whole New World"" (it also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Original Song for ""Friend Like Me"" (also nominated the Golden Globe), and Best Sound, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Score, and Best Special Visual Effects, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, and Best Original Song for ""Prince Ali"". It was number 35 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!",t
26,24 October 2005,lee_eisenberg,10, I'm losin' to a rug!,"In most cases, ""Aladdin"" would just be another Disney cartoon. But Robin Williams as the Genie gives it everything that it needs! Whether it's his monologue when Aladdin first releases him, his Jack Nicholson imitation, or anything else, you're in for something hilarious. Approximately as funny as the Genie are Aladdin's pet monkey Abu, and villain Jafar's parrot Iago. Abu basically exists to spout out a bunch of ""ack"" sounds that only Aladdin can understand, while Iago basically exists to make sarcastic remarks and get injured. With these three, who needs Aladdin's relationship with Jasmine?! Even the Sultan provides a chuckle now and then.",_

28,18 November 2015,veeleen,10, Aladdin may be the best Disney film of them all,"The film opens with a merchant's tell-tale song, performed by the classic Robin Williams. It begins the (inaccurate, but good) story of a boy named Aladdin, who has the power to open the Cave of Wonders, a place that holds magic and wealth. We don't meet Aladdin yet, as it first introduces us to the villain of the story, the well-written ""Jafar"". Jafar is cunning and witty. He is a classic villain, with a terrifying look and an evil laugh. We are shown Jafar and another man trying to open the Cave of Wonders. Since the other man is not Aladdin, he cannot go into the cave and come out unharmed. Jafar grows angry after learning this fate, and hatches a plan to find Aladdin.",r

30,21 June 2000,Quinoa1984,10, Quite good,"Aladdin is upbeat, fun, funny and good entertainment.  And oddly enough, it's all due to Robin Williams.  He brings charm, humor and fun to a character that hasn't been seen in animation in a while.  The story is the tale of wonder- a street rat who wants to win the heart of a princess, so he finds a magic lamp with a genie (voiced amazingly by Williams) who grants him his wish, but consequences come around.  Great fun, especially for kids, who will learn knew characters thanks to Williams impressions. A",
31,23 January 2011,studioAT,6, Robin Williams goes blue,Aladdin again highlights how good Disney can be when it combines all the elements that make their films great. This film has all the heart and humour that a Disney film should have with a great voice cast making the story come alive. There are jokes for all the family and the story can be enjoyed by everyone. The songs are mostly timeless and the film is as beloved today as it was when it was first released.,
32,25 May 2015,jfgibson73,10, Off The Charts Fun,"This movie is as fun as a movie can be. It was hard to believe, coming after Beauty and the Beast, that Disney would slam it home again, but I still remember the feeling of satisfaction of seeing this in the theater. Animated movies, which had been such a big part of my childhood, were officially great again. And the movie holds up. It's another one that finds a way to get your interest early and maintain the excitement right on through. None of the songs are personal favorites, although the short reprise of ""Prince Ali"" is deliciously demented. The animation is beyond world-class, obviously the product of an insane level of work. But the movie also continues to influence family films, for better or worse. Just like Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark ushered in the age of the quick-cut short attention span blockbuster, Genie and Iago made sure every animated kids production had to have sarcastic, wisecracking characters spouting off insults that usually went over young viewers heads'. Movies like Pulp Fiction, Forest Gump, and Aladdin brought in the age of irony, and pop culture has pretty much resided there ever since.",

Anyway, this is one of the mega hits from the 90s, the silver age of Disney animation.. if you ignore the 60's-80's filler films the studio pumped out. Anyway, the late Robin Williams steals the show and really puts this film over the top with his performance as the big blue lovable clown. Good stuff.",

38,13 June 2013,lasttimeisaw,9, Aladdin!,"Watched this Disney's optimal animation in its BluRay form, a stock-in-trade family crowd- pleaser which has been engineered with an impeccable technique and what's more impressive, it oozes an unceasing force of genuineness to edify both children and adults, no condescending doctrine nor feckless naivety, and Robin Williams' voice-performance as the Genie is a great bonus and plays a big part in the film's classic status among its genre. ",
39,26 December 2011,Lejink,8, How the genie got out the bottle...,"A great typical family-oriented Disney feature gets a lift by giving Robin Williams pretty much the run of the place as a genie with a) an attitude and b) a gift for improv. So you get all the expected heart-warming romantic stuff and exciting chases and surprising intrigues but with that soupçon of the unexpected and, deal with it, belly laughs to boot. At a stroke, it broke the mould for countless Disney / Pixar films to come which appealed as much to kids as to adults, by catering to the would-be adults in all the kids and of course the universal kids in all the adults. If I was being critical, perhaps the background-settings could have wowed me a bit more, especially with the fabulous source-material and the vocal characterisation of the evil Jafar a bit more strongly delineated bu I'm probably nit-picking. As someone whose first book was the ""Arabian Nights"" at age 5, and whose only experience of the Aladdin story since has been mostly in local pantomimes down the years, it was great to see Disney's modern but traditional take on the story. The songs are good too, skilfully worded and not over-populous. Interesting to conjecture about the fact that this Hollywood production from 1992 was made at the time of the U.S. involvement in the first Gulf War plus I like the way it, if gently, challenges the notion of female roles in Arabian society, sadly still a topical subject almost 20 years on. Very funny, mildly subversive entertainment you can take your kids to - now that is a rarity in modern cinema.",

I have watched it so many times, that I know all the words. I think this movie is great to watch with the kids. Or even if you don't have kids. I own all three on DVD and VHS. It is the first movie my daughter saw. I think it is the best Disney movie ever made. I like all three, but the first is still my favorite one. it's the original that sticks with you. the others may be good, but not as good as the first. I hope everyone can enjoy this movie.

From what I remember, I enjoyed every Disney animated feature I saw in those days to a certain extent (with the exception of ""Pocahontas""), but for a while, I was pretty much obsessed (I don't know whether that's too strong a word or not) with ""Aladdin""!

47,18 January 2008,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," Just really, really good","If you have any tolerance at all for these animated Disney musicals, this one is sure to be a hit. The plot is good, develops throughout, and manages to be accessible to kids, whilst not talking down to adults. The humor has moments for both groups, as well, entertaining those with two digits in their age with pop culture references and clever comedy. The characters are well-done, interesting and credible. The voice-work is quite good. None of the actors really do badly. Jafar comes across as smart and menacing. Gilbert Gottfried portrays his part well, and his voice works rather well for Iago. Robin Williams... he's great. Some of the best material in the film is his, and he delivers it impeccably. Beyond reproach. Unless you can't stand him and his act, he's sure to get you laughing. The songs are good, well-performed, meaningful and more often than not, catchy. The pacing is spot-on, throughout. The color scheme is full and the animation, with its mix of 2D and 3D, is a pure joy to behold. The energy, creativity and, yes, even emotion, is impressive. The DVD offers, among other things, two commentary tracks(one for directors/producers and one for animators), and a pop-up trivia track, all of which are worth watching for those interested in such things. I recommend this to any fan of the actors and/or Disney animated features. 8/10",

49,8 January 2020,planktonrules,7, Very good...but Jasmine?,"Everybody seems to love Disney's ""Aladdin""...and it is a wonderful film. However, one aspect of it bothered me long ago and still does....Jasmine. Think about it for a moment. Her people are poor, hungry and being oppressed. However, at the same time, she's living in complete luxury...nearly all of her wishes being granted. However, despite that, she wants to run around Baghdad pretending she's poor and hanging out the 'little people'! Doesn't this sound a bit like Queen Marie Antoinette? Such a selfish and annoying girl...in an otherwise enjoyable Disney cartoon. This and Aladdin's propensity to lie, lie, lie make it a film that is problematic and I just didn't enjoy it as much as many viewers. Still, it is worth seeing...with lovely animation and catchy songs....despite an annoying Disney princess.",
50,30 December 2009,JoeytheBrit,4, Surprised by all the positive comments,"I found this Disney re-working to be an incredibly pedestrian affair, with the animation itself the only truly laudable aspect of the whole affair.

54,6 November 2005,The_Void,7, A massive highlight for Disney,"To be honest, even as a kid I didn't really like Disney films all that much - but there was one exception to that rule; and that was Aladdin. Maybe it was the characters, maybe it was the plot, or maybe it was simply the massive amount of fun that the film is; but something clicked then. And, upon seeing the film again as an adult; I can say that, despite the bar being raised for animation by the likes of Toy Story, Aladdin has lost none of what made it great upon release  and the fact that I enjoyed this film as much as my younger sister shows that Aladdin is fun for all ages. Because of the fact that animation has largely moved to 3D, there doesn't seem to be a lot of classic animation about; and that's a shame if you ask me, because I'd rather watch animation like this. The plot is, of course, based upon the classic story of 'Aladdin'; only it's been spruced up by all of the classic Disney elements. The characters are all overdone, there are lots of songs and there's lots of humour; but the classic yarn about a street urchin happening upon a magic genie lamp remains intact.",

Though the genie is always entertaining to watch, he isn't the only enjoyable thing about the affair. In fact, it's generally quite a bit of fun. It has several likeable characters, an effectively dastardly villain and a decent message, to boot. It also has one of the strongest soundtracks in Disney's repertoire. It's a great animated affair that deserves to be remembered as fondly as it is. It puts its remake to shame. 7/10",

The characters are great and the music is superb, I don't think I will ever forget the lyrics to Whole New World or Friend Like Me. The highlight of the entire movie is without a doubt the Genie, superbly voiced by Robin Williams, who was given the rare opportunity of improvising his lines in an animated film, and that made it turn out so well, the kind of crazy lines delivered by Genie never would have happened if they just got Williams to read from a script.

One is Jafar, the scheming Royal Vizier, who needs a 'diamond in the rough' to retrieve a magical lamp from the 'Cave of Wonders'. The other is Princess Jasmine who must marry in three days but hasn't found a suitable princely suitor. Fed up with the restrictive life in the palace she dresses in peasant clothes and goes into the city, where she meets Aladdin.

64,20 September 2010,lisafordeay,10, Robin Williams makes this movie the way it is,"OMG I loved this film since I was a kid. I bought the DVD of it 2 years ago and I was so glad that I bought it. The story is about a commoner who stumbles across an enchanted lamp that holds a hilarious blue Genie who grants him 3 wishes. Aladdin falls in love with an Arabian princess who's father wants her to marry but she doesn't want to marry someone that she doesn't love so one day she disguises herself as a commoner and as the people at the marketplace think that Aladdin is a street rat she is smitten by him. I could go on but I am not giving away too many details as some people mightn't even see this film before. Packed with great music and a great message for people who are commoners and that is 'Accept a person who isn't from a royal background and don't pretend to be a prince(which Aladdin did as he was in love with Jasmine and he thinks that she doesn't date or marry nobody's) and that you just have to be yourself. The chemistry between Aladdin & Jasmine is absolutely fantastic and I love the A Whole New World Scene because its so magical. The real star to this movie is of course Robin Williams who was so hilarious in this movie I laughed so hard every time he impersonates someone e.g Jack Nicolsen or that guy that plays the terminator Arnold (I don't know the surname) but having said that he is the best comedian of all time along with Jim Carrey. The animation is very well done and the ballad A Whole New World is so cute. A friend like me & Prince Ali which is both sung by Robin Williams(yes folks he can sing) are so funny I loved it. Aladdin is my 4th favourite movie of all time along with The Little Mermaid, Beauty & the Beast & Enchanted.",

The sultan meanwhile is distracted by his willful daughter Princess Jasmine (Linda Larkin) who has rejected every suitor and by law must be married by her next birthday. Jasmine eventually leaves the castle disguised as a commoner and is saved by Aladdin (Scott Weinger) an orphaned thief who steals in order to eat and while projecting a cocky attitude also possesses a kind heart and the two form a friendship. Jafar soon learns the ""diamond in the rough"" is Aladdin and sends the guards to capture him despite Jasmine's attempts to dissuade the guards. Jafar disguises himself as an old prisoner and tells Aladdin of the Cave of Wonders which possesses immense treasure and promises it could be what he needs to see Jasmine again with Aladdin having fallen for her. While Aladdin obtains an old lamp from the Cave per the deal with the old man a combination of a sprung trap and Jafar's betrayal leaves him trapped.

70,4 April 2009,insomniac_rod,9, Simply fantastic!,Aladdin should be considered amongst Disney's most complete films. The idea of having a movie set in Middle East territories was excellent mainly because Disney knows how to print it's unique style on different cultures around the world.,
71,15 October 2015,C22Man,8, Las Agrabah,"With Beauty and the Beast receiving a best picture Oscar nomination, Disney's appeal was at a high and they were eager to build on their acclaim. Aladdin was the perfect film for this and took a very different approach for the studio, but they didn't forget what had made the previous few films so successful. It took an old-fashioned, solidly set-up story and gave it a much more modern feel with broader humour. You'd think that this would clash, yet it works brilliantly and gives the film a unique edge. It's a fine balancing act and I'm not sure many other Disney films could have carried it off, but this is one where nearly everything tried works no matter how madcap it may be. ",

It's still considered to be one of the finest animated films ever made, probably even the best Disney film of all time if not for the film that came directly after it, The Lion King, and it also carries the dubious honour of being the unofficial first Dreamworks film. At least in spirit. Because really, think about it. The jokey mood, the pop culture references, the scope and size of the songs.

It is worth noting for the early computer animation, and the excellent voice work by Robin Williams, Gilbert Gottfried, Frank Welker, and Jonathan Freeman, but on the whole, this is nothing but a big Saturday morning cartoon. For one thing, the 2-D artwork is absolute crap. The characters look like they're off of cereal boxes, and even the backgrounds are shoddy. The animation is technically very good, but good animation isn't all that impressive if the characters are crudely drawn to begin with. Compare this to stuff like, say, ""Pinocchio"" to see the huge difference in effort and talent on the artists' part.",

However, if you ask me, the Genie (voice of Reobin Williams) gave the funniest performance of everyone who acted in the film.

Aladdin is originally one of those dark stories with complicated language and plot, but directors Clements and Musker look beyond the obstacle and, once again, produce a great animated movie for children and adults. This film is wonderful. From the beginning, when a mysterious merchant sings one of the greatest ""onde upon a time"" songs ever, passing from the romantic moment, you are so fascinated with colors, camera movements and great voices, you can't take you eyes off of the screen. Incredible characters, a strong villain, good songs and breath-taking soundtrack and scenes, it has everything a Disney classic needs to be great. And this great would not be so great if Robin Williams wasn't the genie. What a talented guy. Jonathan Freeman as Jafar is not far behind, he helps the making of the best Disney villain. The characters animation is soft and beautiful, uninterested, the way the directors like. No matter the climax concludes with a (kind of) inexpressive phrase, it's only a minimum detail, and minimum details is for Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale (Beauty and the Beast), who seem to only care about that. Clements and Musker are a lot of steps ahead because they are the ones who inherited Walt Disney's magic. Let's hope they stay active for a good time.",

Based on a concept from the late Howard Ashman and its directors Ron Clements and John Musker coming off the success of The Little Mermaid, the film was a humongous success on its original release and has since spawned countless merchandise, sequels, and even a live-action remake in 2019. Known for its innovative usage of pop culture spewing humor that would soon become a staple in the mainstream animation industry, the film itself is both a hysterical comical roller coaster and a surprisingly heartwarming story on being honest about yourself.",

96,28 January 2012,sikes23,9, THoughts on this movie,"Just watched this recently, on the new-and-improved DVD which features a restored print, and it looks spectacular. The story is slightly shallower than the best of Disney's films, but this is balanced by the sheer lunacy of Robin Williams' bad, blue Genie. Whoever first thought of putting Robin Williams in a Disney flick should get a Pulitzer, or a Nobel, or something. The comic timing of his riffs combined with the comic timing of the animators transform the Genie from a ""Deus Ex Machina"" into the soul of ""Aladdin."" I have a tiny issue with the fact that the most recent VHS and DVD prints of the movie have bowed to pressure from activist groups and altered a line in the opening song. The original line was, ""...where they cut if your ear if they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" The revised line reads, ""...where the land is immense and the heat is intense/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" Protesters claimed the original line perpetuated a negative stereotype of Arab countries and peoples. But...but...but marketplaces and cities in Arabian countries still cut the hands off convicted thieves. And there's even a scene in the film which threatens to relieve the princess of an appendage. They're not being negative; they're being accurate. And, oh yeah, IT'S A CARTOON. But that's just my opinion.",

The genie tends to overwhelm in the 2nd half of the movie, and the ugly character flaws, continual lying of the protagonist (not telling the princess who he really is - which also shows he can't read people b/c clearly she likes the street urchin), are bared for the audience to see in the 2nd half of the movie, which is why I am not rating this an 8 or 9.",
112,4 March 2019,vjnambu,9, A movie which turns me into a kid,"When I was a child, during eid holidays Disney channel was added in my TV for three days and in that I got to see Aladdin cartoon. I don't remember any story or scenes but the only thing I remembered was that I thoroughly enjoyed it. Years later, when I was watching TV I was checking the info of coming programmes in a movie channel and I saw there was Aladdin so I thought to check it out that time though I never had any idea of the 1992 film. And when I started watching I got surprised to see those same cartoon characters I saw in my childhood. Looked like my childhood came back.
The biggest plus point of Aladdin is its mesmerizing and fascinating hand drawn animation which transports you to another world. The next plus point is its humor and light hearted treatment. All the characters shown in this film I love a lot. Charming Aladdin, stunning Jasmine, cute like a Teddy bear Sultan, cunning and wicked Jafar and his loudmouthed sidekick iago, greedy but lovable Abu, helpful magic carpet and the wholesome entertainer Genie(thanks to the super energetic Robin Williams). Only rajah was underused in the whole movie but his relationship with jasmine was shown pretty well.Last but not the least to mention is the songs which goes well with the narrative. I love all the songs especially Arabian nights, friend like me, Prince Ali and whole new world.
But the only issue which bugged me was the palace shown doesn't have any watchmen, bodyguards, servants and maid. What palace is it without them? There is only sultan, jasmine and rajah inside the palace. Did the animators forget to draw them or didn't have the budget for it?
Aladdin is the best animation movie in the world, and the best Disney film. I don't why today's Disney films don't have the magic of Aladdin.
On the whole, Aladdin is a film which nobody will hate unless you don't have a kid inside you.",

The story is good, Robin Williams is outstanding, Pixar blew me away with the back drop, and the supporting cast Disney until after this movie was famous for rocked. Abu and carpet were predictably better written for than the main cast, and Gilbert was made to play Iago. The movies only downfall that I can think of was its love song - the typical Disneyesque cheese "" A Whole new World"". It takes a bottle of Drano and a toilet brush to get that song out of your head. A true animated classic to show your kids and grandkids. Too bad Disney thought 3 outstanding movies (Mermaid, Beauty and Beast, and Aladdin) were enough and started dealing out the slop it is known for today (at least until Pizar came along and stole the show).",

Even if one isn't particularly moved by the love story between the title character (Scott Weinger) and his girlfriend Jasmine (Linda Larkin), you can easily get lost in Williams's improvisational energy and the equally entertaining performances of Freeman and Gilbert Gottfried (as Jafar's parrot).",

It has teaches you that you don't have to be someone or something that you are not to have others like you. I love Genie though the most. That might also be cause I'm a huge Robin Williams fan. The characters are awesome and developed well by the creators of each one. I will say though and as retarded as this may sound. When I was younger I had a crush on Aladdin.

The best thing about the film is that no matter what your age, you'll love this movie because it has everything that makes a great film. It has great voice acting, awesome action, very funny jokes from Robin Williams, a classic story, and a classic romance. Scott Weinger's voice is near perfect as Aladdin. It blends so well with the character, almost seamlessly. The hilight of the film is Robin Williams as the Blue Genie. His jokes are nothing short of hysterical, and there are some jokes that only adults will get. He does an impressive array of impressions including Jack Nicholson and Rodney Dangerfield. The only fault I have is Linda Larkin as Jasmine. She just doesn't seem right, but it isn't that big of a deal. The songs are absolutely spectacular, the best being 'Whole New World'. The film is still as good to me at age 17 as it was at age 7, because it is just so magical and lovable. It's a classic through the ages that I think everyone should watch.

142,31 December 2009,Larry41OnEbay-2,7," Rewatchable? Consider the dizzying, elastic miracle wrought by Robin Williams!","ALADDIN premiered November 25th of 1992 and was both produced and distributed by Disney. It was their 31st animated feature coming right behind THE LITTLE MERMAID and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and just before THE LION KING. It is based on the Arab folktale of Aladdin and the magic lamp from One Thousand and One Nights. As of today there are actually 27 film versions of this story. Movie buffs point to the 1924 silent film THE THIEF OF BAGDAD starring Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and the 1940 version which had Sabu & Conrad Veidt as two of the best. Back when Walt Disney was still alive and doing his own casting he never wanted to meet the actors face to face before the role was cast. He would stay in his office and have the actors audition into a microphone in another room and have the sound pumped thru speakers into his office so he could only base his judgment on what he heard. This way he could select the best voice to fit the animated characters as he saw them in his head. During script and storyboard development, the writers were already considering Robin Williams for the role of the Genie but had not approached him for the project. In order to convince Williams to do the role, Eric Goldberg animated the Genie doing several minutes of Williams' stand-up routines and screened it for him. Williams was so impressed that he signed almost immediately. Directors Musker and Clements created the Genie with Robin Williams in mind; even though John Candy, Steve Martin, and Eddie Murphy were considered. Unusually for an animated film, much of Williams' dialogue was ad-libbed: for some scenes, Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions, but allowed to improvise his lines. It was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters. Eric Goldberg, the supervising animator for the Genie, then reviewed Williams' 16 hours of recorded dialogue and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match. Most critics' praise went to Robin Williams' performance as Genie, with Janet Maslin of The New York Times declaring that children ""needn't know precisely what Mr. Williams is evoking to understand how funny he is"". Warner Bros animator Chuck Jones even called the film ""the funniest feature ever made."" Robin Williams was born in Chicago and educated at Julliard but this stand-up comedian became an over night sensation on TV's Mork & Mindy before going onto acting in films. He has been nominated for four Oscars and won one Academy Award, so far. Roger Ebert said, ""All of the film's best moments come from the genie and the other supporting characters, which include a plump little sultan, his scheming vizier, an angry parrot named Iago, a chattering monkey, a friendly flying carpet, and even a magic cave that turns into a fearsome face so that Aladdin has to venture down its throat. Ever since Jiminy Cricket first danced onto the screen, Disney animators have created entertaining supporting casts, and the magic carpet is one of the most ingenious: with only tassels and body language to work with, it somehow possesses a complete personality, whisking Aladdin on terrifying swoops around the kingdom. The scene-stealing monkey Abu (with noises supplied by Frank Welker) is a particular treat, as when he jealously mimics the Princess or otherwise comments on Aladdin's adventures."" Janet Maslin of the New York Times said, """"Master, I hear and obey,"" said the Genie in the storybook version of ""Aladdin,"" and his comments seldom went further than that. For an exercise in contrast, consider the dizzying, elastic miracle wrought by Robin Williams, Walt Disney Pictures' bravura animators and the Oscar-winning songwriting team of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman in ""Aladdin,"" the studio's latest effort to send the standards for animated children's films into the stratosphere. What will children make of a film whose main attraction -- the Genie himself -- has such obvious parent appeal? They needn't know precisely what Mr. Williams is evoking to understand how funny he is. And the crazily antic pacing of the Genie's outbursts will be utterly familiar to small viewers, even if they can't identify a lightning-fast evocation of ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" What will come through clearly to audiences of any age is the breathless euphoria of Mr. Williams' free associations, in which no subject is off-limits, not even Disney itself."" But this film is not with out controversy: In the opening credits song ARABIAN NIGHTS a line is sung, ""Where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but, hey, it's home,"" in the original release to video release changed the line to ""Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense/It's barbaric, but, hey, it's home.""",

145,30 October 2008,kyle-cruse,8, Probably one of Disney's best,"What an entirely enjoyable family film. ""Aladdin"" is actually pretty close to perfection. The plot is typical for most Disney movies of its type, similar to films such as ""The Little Mermaid"" or ""The Lion King."" As usual, of course, what makes these films great is not the plot but all of the little details throw in to make it fun. In ""Aladdin,"" it's Robin Williams as the Genie that makes the film so great. He steals every scene he is in, moving quickly from one great joke or imitation to another. The reason I like this film so much is because of these scenes. I don't believe there's another actor besides Williams who could have voiced this role so well. Williams fans young and old alike will be entirely delighted and joyful after seeing his performance. This film also has several great original songs, including the Oscar-winning ""A Whole New World"" and ""Never Had a Friend Like Me."" The only real reason the film comes off as less than perfect is because of the last few scenes. I hate snakes, and I think Jafar's transformation into a giant snake toward the end is far too scary for the young audience the film was intended for. If the film hadn't taken this unnecessary step, it could have been perfect in my book. Nevertheless, it is still tons of fun, and one of the funniest and most enjoyable Disney films you will probably ever see.",

The songs are very well done. Of course we all know that ""A Whole New World"" is a fantastic song that really gets stuck in your head. The animation on characters isn't as good as it was in ""The Beauty and the Beast"", but it makes up for that with extremely epic moments like when they are trying to escape The Cave of Wonders. Characters aren't the greatest Disney has done. That is except for Genie. Robin Williams delivers a funny, energetic, and extremely entertaining performance. You can ask anyone on the planet what their favorite part of Aladdin is, and they will all answer Robin Williams. The Genie in my opinion is definitely one of the great Disney characters. The romance (just like the animation) is not as good as it was in ""The Beauty and the Beast"". Still the romance is filled with all the good old mushy stuff that little kids always turn their head at.

Usually I skip the songs in Disney movies because you just do not need them to understand the movie here I wanted to hear the music and here you really miss something if you should skip the music. There is a song that I have not listened to either in the movie nor in any other way because I just do not want to hear now but I could listen to Robin Williams as the genius for days.

It was also great to see Robin Williams make his second animated debut as the Genie, whom his successors couldn't match up in the direct to video sequels as well as the upcoming live action remake, which will include all the original songs and a match for match recreation of the cartoon. The opening song's lyrics were changed for the home release since it was too scary at the time, and the vhs release came out with a teaser to what would become Disney's biggest animated 2d film ever, The Lion King, which like this movie as well as Dumbo, will get the live action treatment and will be more popular than Aladdin and Dumbo.",

Even today, I still laugh at the jokes (some of them are a little puerile, but they don't rely excessively on them, unlike The Emperor's New Groove, and plenty of them actually triggered me to chuckle), immerse myself in the songs and beautiful animation, and with all of that, I know I will eventually see it again. My one complaint would have to be that while the songs are among the best you will find in a 1992 movie, you may have to watch the film or clips of it constantly in order to make the songs memorable, because even though I last watched this before I even considered becoming an IMDb reviewer, I still couldn't remember some of the lyrics to top-notch songs like A Whole New World. That doesn't change the fact, though, that this movie is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates Disney, musicals, early 1990's films, or films set in the Middle East (I heard that Persia is the specific setting for this film, but I am not an analyst in that regard.

He is easily my favorite part of the entire thing. Jafar is another amazing character in this movie. He's easily one of my favorite Disney villains. He's so utterly despicable and he knows it. It is so much fun watching him on screen. The music freaking rocks too. All of it is catchy and memorable and it makes me want to buy it.

I also received the Musical Masterpiece edition on DVD that came with a free lyrics book a few Christmases ago. This film also has one of the best soundtracks that is on par with those from 'The Little Mermaid (my mum's favourite Disney film and one of mine),' 'Pocahontas (my sister's favourite and also one of mine)', and 'The Lion King (one of my housemate's favourite Disney films as well as this one)'. My top three songs here are 'A Whole New World (the version in the film itself and also the closing credits version plus its beautiful matching incidental music version),' 'Friend Like Me' and 'Prince Ali.' The opening song 'Arabian Nights' was the most authentic-sounding of them all. The rest of the incidental music by Alan Menken was tense and poignant at the right moments if somewhat generic. While this film is memorable for the most part, I found certain scenes and the song 'One Jump Ahead' forgettable, which are some of my only complaints.",

182,11 February 2022,ThomasColquith,6," Good, but could have been better","""Aladdin"" is surely one of the better animated films out there featuring memorable characters, lush scenery and beautiful animation. But the film is hampered by the genie's excessive ""patter"" (a word used by so many reviewers). The over-the-top genie character distracts from everything else that is working. His stand-up routine is especially now dated and irrelevant to most young viewing audiences and his jokes and antics are not funny but vexing. If the genie was toned down a bit as well as toning down Jafar, especially at the end, then this would have been an excellent film. They should have kept it more grounded and focused on human relationships and class differences. Yes I know there is a flying carpet and magical genie so this is not supposed to be realism, but the film just seemed to get out of control for my tastes. I liked the ""Whole New World"" song and scene, though some of the music did sound like the ""Reading Rainbow"" song to my ear, and the beginning hunt for the lamp seemed heavily dependent on ""Raiders of the Last Ark"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"". So all things considered I rate this film a 6/10, and I've just seen it once as an adult so no nostalgia points from me.",
183,8 August 2006,pvilleguy,5, Perfect illustration,"Many of you have probably read that one of the problems with Disney's animated films after about 1965 or so is the too-great reliance on well-known actors doing the voice work. ""Aladdin"" clearly illustrates the problem. Instead of using the script and skillful animation of facial expressions and other movements to give the characters personality, the current generation of Disney animators relies on identifiable actors to supply the personality for the characters in the process of the voice over. Thus, the Genie, voiced by Robin Williams, overwhelms and dominates the film as Williams tends to do in any film he's a part of. The Genie becomes a fast-talking hip comedian. Great, though it seems more than a little out of place in the context of the general story of Aladdin and his lamp. A similar observation can be made about the parrot, Iago, voiced by Gilbert Gottfried. Of course this is a children's film, but it seems to me that the presence of Williams and Gottfried dumbs this story down rather significantly, turning a story intended to be about the mysteries of the Middle East into a western pop culture fest geared toward short attention spans. I guess Disney studios has a rather low opinion of kids these days, or maybe a low opinion of what they need to inject into films to entertain the parents taking their kids to see these movies.",

190,11 July 2006,chrisbishop5000,10, A Whole New World! Beautiful and unique from every angle!,"Nothing on earth could ever compete against this enormous Disney blockbuster. The animation is outstanding, not only are the hand-drawn cartoons rich and detailed with the use of very striking colours but the CGI is incredible as well. The way the Beast has been created that guards the Cave of Wonders looks so real and sinister that it transported me into an entirely different world just sitting in my bedroom and watching it on the telly. It's surprising that it was never shown at IMAX cinemas, but then again, this was 1992 and I shouldn't think IMAX was around then. There is not a single sign of boredom, silliness, cruelty or any other bad points in a film, it's fantastic all over. The characters and the natures of the characters were very well considered and put into deep thought. Aladdin is a carefree young man who is poor and homeless who seems happy and perhaps the sort of boy who is up-to-no-good sometimes but deep down there is a feeling of insecurity and we are able to see how sad he really is. Jasmine has an incredibly strong mind (for a Disney Princess at least) and loses her temper quite easily but deep down she is sick and tired of having her ""life lived for her"" and with these two things, she is charming and rather funny. Jafar is quite different to ordinary Disney villains who'd normally yell ""I'll get you yet! Ha-ha-ha!"" He's dark and mysterious and witty with it, looking at him he looks like he's psychologically poorly when he plots evil schemes and people like that need medical help not being banged up in jail for god's sake! Think how hard it must be for them! I'm sure he's insecure too, at heart. The Genie has got to be the funniest supporting character Disney has ever come up with. Robin Williams, I have to say, was the perfect choice for this bundle of giant, hilarious fun. The Genie looked as if he'd gone a bit off his rocker in some scenes - but that's all the better. Irritating Aladdin, in one or two sequences, had me in hysterics, dressing up as pretty ladies and funny-looking men was side-splitting comedy and there are lots more gags from the Genie that'll always leave me giggling after the film. The Sultan is a rather eccentric, gullible character who tries to find Jasmine her perfect match but doesn't seem to be doing very well as she gets it clear to him that she wants to make her own choice of man, and he also, is very funny, especially when he pinches Aladdin's cheek and a slobbery kind of sound comes from out his mouth. The storyline is very interesting. A golden lamp is hidden in a mysterious cave but only one person may make their entrance and Jafar, to his dismay, is not that person. Who could it be? You guessed it! It's Aladdin! Jasmine escapes her Arabian palace so that she can lead her own life and then accidentally bumps into Aladdin, the man she truly loves. The palace guards arrest Aladdin and Jafar lies to a heartbroken Jasmine that he thought that the street-boy captured her against her will and he has already been put to death. Jafar dresses as an old beggar and takes Aladdin to the cave and promises him a grand reward if he fetched the magic lamp. Aladdin soon becomes trapped in the cave and now he has the chance to find out what is so special about this old, dented lamp - a big genie with a massive personality will answer that question! But despite the fact that his plan has failed Jafar is not going to give up getting his hands on the lamp! Soon enough Aladdin is powerless to put constant stops to Jafar's schemes. If ""Fantasia"" took you on a breathtaking adventure then you really ought to soar away from the normal world with this incredible film-experience. This is just too good to miss! Take it from me, you'll love it.",

Lea Salonga should have had a solo because her voice is so beautiful. Although I'm not a huge Robin Williams fan, I loved him as the Genie. This was the perfect character for him. It's too bad we don't see more of Scott Weinger--he is perfectly made for the title role. I loved everything about this movie.

Despite it is for children, the quality of the characters is very good, the story, though predictable and typical, results interesting and, which is more important, it males us to spend a good hour and a half. The songs (typical in Disney) never are boring, and are surprisingly well mixed with images. In addition, action scenes are well ended and most characters are very charismatic. Aladdin is sympathetic form the beginning and most secondary characters are simply perfect. The ""acting"" of the Genius is superb in his strangeness and absurd, and Yafar is well remembered as one of the ""best"" bad ones of the history of cinema. It exhales an immense aura of evilness hardly ever seen in a movie...

196,26 June 2012,japamo,8," Is ""Aladdin"" Nothing Without the Genie?","It's hardly a mystery why the ""Aladdin"" myth attracted Disney's animation crew back in 1992. This timeless story boasts everything: exotic locales, a scrappy hero, flamboyant characters, opulent royalty, giddy romance, despicable and devious villains, and, most tellingly, the endless possibilities of magic as epitomized by the genie. However, as Disney's animators crafted this dynamic spectacle of a movie, I think they must have been concerned that one of ""Aladdin""'s greatest assets -the protean, boundlessly energetic, and fast-talking Genie, as voiced by the inimitable comic pantomiming maelstrom Robin Williams- might ironically turn out to be one of its greatest liabilities. In the Genie, we have a dominating, omnipotent character who can seemingly do anything. So, once Aladdin gets possession of the Genie's lamp, isn't the movie over? Just three wishes, and it's happily ever after.",

He discovers an old lamp and to his surprise, a genie voiced by Robin Williams pops out.  Williams is in rare form as Disney seems to have let him do whatever he wants, which fits since it is a genie who has been bottled up for so long.

When I heard ""One Jump Ahead"", I loved it. When I heard ""Prince Ali"", I loved it. And then when ""A Whole New World"" came along, I was like, ""oh my god"". It is an amazing song. If I were to knock any points off it would be for the animation, which doesn't seem on par with Disney quality at times. But other than that, this is one of the best Disney movies ever released.

Aladdin is just a lovable protagonist and Jasmine a great love interest. That makes a lovely couple who I can root for and will defend.The sultan isn't as dumb as I thought he would be. For me he is the main comedic character. The songs feel really special and really add a whole new dimension to the story. The animation is really and fits very well with the atmosphere. The first scene really sets the tone for me. I immediately knew it was going to be good.

However, that did not stop me from watching this film many times during my life. Ever since I was little, this was my favorite Disney movie. This is an excellent film. It teaches great morals, and executes them very well. The story is about Aladdin falling in love with Princess Jasmine, but finds out she can only marry a prince, due to the law. He acquires a lamp with the Genie inside, and he wishes to become a prince, or should I say, look like one. This is my only problem with the film, but this can be overlooked. Why can't he wish he WAS a prince instead of looking like one? But it moves very well into the moral, so I can excuse this. After finding out he would become Sultan after marrying Jasmine, he decides to try and tell her the truth that he's not actually a prince. It's actually before the villain fight and not at the exact end where we have a moral. I like that. He learns that he needs to be truthful, and was trying to tell Jasmine before Jafar exposes him for who he really is. He also learns to keep promises. Before his first wish with the Genie, he promises him he would use his 3rd wish to free him, and even at the end, the Genie tries to talk him into wishing into a prince again, but Aladdin still frees him, despite unlikely being able to marry Jasmine. Nice guy. That is a fantastic way of telling your morals.",

And that was just one of the many songs I loved in this movie. I also enjoyed that song ""A Whole New World"" It had a very beautiful motion to it, I can see why that won an Academy Award. And what about that guy with the twisted beard and the staff, Jafar I think it was, he was such an awesome villain, he had all the qualities of a perfect bad guy, and his genius was well backed up by that sarcastic loudmouth sidekick Iago, he cracked me up.

As a kid, this was an amazing film; hilarious, thrilling, engaging and definitely on par with Disney's best. Coming back to it after so long and little has changed. However, there were a few things that detracted my present experience from that of my childhood. The first half of the film is overall a little on the boring side. Other than the unveiling of Robin Williams' show stopping Genie, the music, visuals and Jafar, the rest of characters weren't as compelling as i remember. The main protagonists and their romantic endeavour isn't the most magical in Disney's history (compared to say ""Lady and the Tramp"" it's desperately shallow), which is a shame since they take up most of the plot. Jasmine is still gorgeous with a fiery personality trying to break free of a restrained life, but Aladdin is quite a standard underdog, his plight not really drawing great sympathy, despite the fact he's a swell guy and all with a heart of gold. So really, Jasmine's attraction to him comes of quite ""same old trick"" sort of thing, both individuals having the same ""trapped"" feeling in life that brings them together.",

The first animated film to gross $200,000,000 domestically 3. The comedic styling's of Robin Williams and Gilbert Gottfried. With Aladdin, I expected a completely different film, but being a fan of Robin Willaims, I was not surprised how good it was. I was depressed when they canceled plans on re-releasing the film to Imax like they did with Beauty and the Beast and the Lion king. The film creators found who i think is the best villain actor of all time in Jonathan Freeman(Jafar). Him, Elanor Audley(Lady Tremaine and Maleficent), George Sanders(Shere Khan), Vincent Price(Ratigan), Pat Carroll(Ursula), and Jeremy Irons(Scar) are the best as well.

I vividly remember going to see each and one of them (starting with ""Mermaid"" in the spring of 1990) on the big screen. Those were scarce moments of true childhood innocence. Times that you take with you forever, and Disney has done just that to almost every kid in the world during the last 70 years. ""Aladdin"" came out at the peak of Disney's third golden age that started in 1989. The company released a number of films which broke new ground in animation and were huge artistic and commercial successes as well. Although it broke a few records when it came out on video in 1993, for some odd reason, this DVD release sold a meager amount of copies, catching everyone at the studio by surprise.

245,13 January 2016,corymauricejohnson,5, Meh,"Not the worst Disney movie, but pretty close. Lacks any real emotional depth, and just replaces it with Robin Williams slapstick. A Whole New World is one of the Disney songs, but a generic even for Disney plot and clear racism counteract that. This movie doesn't have any depth, just some white Indians defeating the evil, dark Indians. Some might commend this movie for being the first one with out an extremely pale Disney princess, but making her skin slightly darker doesn't change the fact that she's an even more out of touch brat. Some people might not like reviewing children's movies, but when a movie is so widely loved like Aladdin, I say it's fair game. Children are gonna like the movie no matter how bad it is, so why not review it for the 13+ demographic?",
246,17 January 2011,BenD25,10, Ranks Among My Top 10,"Like ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" holds some of my fondest childhood memories. Like the other two, I watched this in the theaters (even vividly remembering how I was annoyed that the princess was given a modern name). What's great about ""Aladdin"" is that Disney didn't try to duplicate ""Beauty"", which was arguably a huge hit. Instead, it's the complete opposite of Beauty: a quirk-filled comedy owned almost entirely by the Genie (Robin Williams). Artistically, it's also a departure from its predecessors. Aladdin doesn't look like your typical Disney film. Every object in the background is rounded, like the characters, and the style is more loose and cartoony. The music is a notch down from ""Mermaid"" and ""Beauty"" but ""Prince Ali"" and ""A Whole New World"" hold up pretty well. All in all, another winner from Disney. The Platinum Edition DVD is still available in most markets outside the US, so grab one while you can.",
247,1 October 2002,MattTheRaven,8, If not for Robin Williams...,"This movie woulda rated, maybe, a 7. The music is fun and the other character actors are decent enough, but William's ad-libs and characteristically manic nature make this movie so much more enjoyable - I consider it my favorite Disney movie - than it would've been otherwise. [Though, in reference to The Return of Jafar, Dan Castenella was horrible as the Genie, and Gilbert Gottfried's Iago shown through as the comic star.]",
248,8 April 2023,atleverton,9, Some of the songs are bangers,"It was quite interesting to watch this movie after watching the first seven or so Disney feature films - this is a film that grabs you from the beginning and holds your attention until the end. The opening number Arabian Nights sets up the story perfectly. It's a tune that really sticks in your head, which is true of the other great number, prince Ali. The plot is really well paced and there's no slow moments in the film, characters really work well together and all of their motivations are clear. It's clear by this time, Disney Studios had the financial resources to put money into the production of its films, and they were the best at what they did when this film was released. Obviously, I enjoyed the film, but I think there are parts that just didn't hold up. The first time I watched it I thought Robin Williams's performance as the genie was hilarious, but it contains a lot of references that audiences, today would have trouble understanding. For example, there's a reference to Ed Sullivan and Rodney Dangerfield. My kids did not understand these references at all - but what they really found funny was the character of Iago. I have to say that makes sense because the comedy connected to this character is more timeless - it's basically an irritable old man - and everyone knows at least one of those. The animation at times is clearly CGI from the era, and it looks dated. There is also the fact that the evil characters are portrayed in a more stereotypically Arab way whereas the main characters are portrayed in a more stereotypically American way, even though these characters live in the same area. I think this is mostly in regard to the character of Jafar, who was designed independently of the rest of the characters and resembles what a human version of Scar from The Lion King would look like. So that's a bit racist - but it's not racist in the same way Song of the South is racist. It's racist in a way that all the people who created this movie are not from this culture, and you're making a movie about characters that are from this culture, so you're applying your kind of own standards of what is good and bad and what looks good and bad. The other thing is that because the movie flows along so quickly the main characters meet and fall in love within about 2 minutes which is a little bit unrealistic, but I prefer that than a slow paced movie. The characters of Aladdin and Jasmine are also interesting, there's real character development there. Jasmine gets to make choices, and she's portrayed as being a real person. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see the best of Disney.",

As Snow White is the innoncent girl Princess Jasmine is more of a serious and more adventure loving princess with a tough tiger as a guard, but she is under the shadows of Jafar. The animation goes all out from the Arabian dreamlike surroundings to the wacky and Looney Tunes like with the all star voices giving it all like the goofy screechy Gilbert Gottfried and the booming Genie Robin Williams. This is also for men as there are action, adventure and old movie shoutout too so give this a watch when you have 80 minutes back when Disney family movies was under the 2 hour mark unlike today.",
259,29 August 2001,jodikane,9, A Disney Classic!,"The Disney version of Aladdin is the best one I have ever seen, and in my opinion, Aladdin is the third greatest movie made by the Walt Disney Company. Glen Keane again manages to create a great design for Aladdin, who is very handsome. The voices are great, and Robin Williams does a fantastic job as Genie. The animation, of course using the new CAPS system is wonderful, although I do miss the old Xerography movies. The new ones aren't the same as the coloring is now done by computer, whereas from 101 Dalmatians (1961)up until The Little Mermaid (1989) it was all done by hand. Lea Salonga does a great duet with Brad Kane in the Academy Award winning song 'A Whole New World' which is definitely the best song in the film, closely followed by 'One Jump Ahead (Reprise)' sung beautifully by Brad Kane, who I hope will do more singing for Disney and other company's, apart from the sequels to Aladdin, as I believe he has the most beautiful male singing voice in the world. Keep it up Disney, your movies are the greatest!",

If you get the DVD, you'll get bonus features of how they made the movie and the behind-the-scenes of some of the songs. The song,""A Whole New World"", is the highlight of this special film when Aladdin starts singing to Jasmine how he could take her to a whole new world as they ride the magic carpet at night throughout the land!!!

269,1 November 2015,cheebernard,9, Aladdin is not match to Hercules.,even though Aladdin is funny but not impressive as Hercules. Hercules make me understand what is called being a hero. but this movie Aladdin needs upgrade because I am not impressed and satisfied with the movie why even Aladdin is for adventure not for education as Hercules and Lion king. however it didn't match to lion king. the movie is not amazing because they did not try so hard as lion king. Lion king is best because not so much disappointing as Hercules. However I expect more from Aladdin. P.S this movie shows some graphic images like trying to cut of some one's arm and this movie needs lot of upgrade it's too unsatisfying because it didn't match to lion king and Hercules. if I see the movie I would be less uncomfortable but not so bad as Sailor moon. one thing I like about this movie was genie who is hilarious but Aladdin is not that powerful or smart as Simba who kicked Scar. I expect more from Aladdin.,
270,18 July 2000,FZAN,9, Fun and funny.,"Aladdin is a very fun movie and one of the few I enjoy watching again and again.  It has many of Disney's most entertaining characters, and you gotta love that Genie!",
271,12 September 2008,Sasha_5,6, Can be enjoyed LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF TIMES,"We literally wore out 3 Disney VHS editions of this film before it was released on DVD. Now several years later, our youngster watches this film just as much as ever and we enjoy seeing it with him: OVER & OVER & OVER!! SOUNDS GREAT - LOOKS GREAT & IT'S GOT ROBIN WILLIAMS & AN EXCITING PLOT TOO! IN A NUTSHELL: A WHOLE NEW WORLD & IT INCLUDES ROBIN WILLIAMS AS THE GENIE This DVD release of 'Aladdin' by Disney is a treat for audiences regardless of age. It is one of the few films I can think of that both children and their parents may equally enjoy, and this Platinum Edition DVD is the best way I know to bring Aladdin into our homes. WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: BOY MEETS GIRL - BOY MUST BE WORTHY OF GIRL ON HIS OWN MERITS! Jasmine is 'PRINCESS JASMINE' and she must be married to a prince before her 18th birthday, which is in three days, as the film opens. Needless to say, she is less than excited by the suitors who have presented to claim her. ""Another Stuffed Shirt - Swaggering Peacock"", to use her words. After deciding to runaway - without planning for any expenses or anything for that matter - she runs into Aladdin during a street market fracas caused by her lack of currency, and is saved by Aladdin from the knife point of a greedy merchant. Thinking that Jasmine was just an ordinary girl, Aladdin set his sights on her, but found it was necessary to flee from the palace guards several times with Jasmine in tow. Aladdin discovers to his chagrin, as Jasmine declares her identity to the palace guards, that she is no ordinary girl, which puts her out of Aladdin's reach. BUT THIS IS ONLY WHERE THE STORY BEGINS: ALADDIN: ""THE DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH"" Believe it or not, the film goes along happily for over 40 minutes before Robin Williams makes his entrance as the Genie. By this time we know that Aladdin must elevate his station to attain the hand of 'Princess Jasmine' - but how? A PRINCESS MUST BE MARRIED TO A PRINCE! BUT PRINCE ALI? Acquiring the services of the Genie for three wishes has made it possible for Aladdin to elevate his station rather profoundly by simply wishing for it. So Prince Ali is born, along with a terrific song, lyrics and video action. Unfortunately, wishing does not make one different on the inside, and this Prince Ali charade is doomed from the start. But -- Aladdin will elevate himself and redeem the trust which Princess Jasmine was beginning to place in him, on his own merit. THERE IS STILL MORE--LOTS MORE: ONE CAN'T JUST WISH FOR SELF-IMPROVEMENT-ASK ALADDIN This film has a lovely story and wonderful animation, but it also has Robin Williams who gives a truly over-the-top performance as the Genie. He is the Genie and is so quick and witty and glib that audiences, regardless of age, will really zone in on his delivery. His role clearly demonstrates that one cannot simply change or improve oneself by simply wishing for it. This type of change and improvement comes from within and we go back to the theme 'the diamond in the rough'. No decent hero can be much of a hero without a fiendish and sly villain over whom to prevail. 'Jafar' and his evil sidekick 'Iago' provide the needed balance to present Aladdin with a real obstacle. Jafar readily grabs at the chance to elevate his standing by wishing for it, and first wishes to be the Sultan, then the ""most powerful sorcerer in the world"" and ultimately the ""all-powerful genie"". This leads him down the path that Aladdin did not take and we get to see exactly what Jafar reaps in the end, which demonstrates that the only way to improve oneself is by exerting an honest effort, not just wishing for it. IN THE END: WE GET BACK TO WHERE WE BEGAN. This is a truly wonderful animated family classic to enjoy watching again and again. It combines excellent catchy songs with wonderful video images. Robin Williams as the Genie is incredible which serves to highlight this very worthwhile story and amazing tale.",
272,25 May 2019,Ryan_Barbakins,9, A Dazzling Place of Wonders,"Aladdin is such a fantastic, energetic, exciting, romantic film. The characters are all very lovable and zany in their own fashion (especially Genie).
The 2 main reasons I love this film are, 1: Aladdin's arch in this film is very intriguing. He goes through the journey of changing who he is to impress someone, but finds out that she preferred the unfiltered Aladdin, not Prince Ali. This is not only a great message to children, but also a very compelling journey to be a part of.
And 2: The Genie is Excellent! He is so jumpy and hilarious. He might actually be my favorite Disney character. No other person than Robbin Williams could have made him who he is.
My one complaint with this film, is that Aladdin and Jasmine fell in love with each other after being together for one day. I know it's a love at first site kinda thing, but if they gave more time to develop their relationship, then there would be a lot more hard-hitting moments in the film.
Also this film has A Whole New World. Do I even need to explain?",

No other Disney movie even comes close to this combination of childhood fun and adult humor like Aladdin. There are more memorable lines in this movie than I can count - ""Exits are here, here, here, here, everywhere!"" - ""I can't believe it, I'm losing to a rug!"" - and the songs are especially memorable, even for Disney.

277,28 February 2005,vilincica,7, Last Great Disney,"Aladdin was in my opinion one of the last Disney's great adventures, the last being The Lion KIng......... after that it all went downhill. The stories stopped being interesting, the music became average. To me, it seems like that magical something these animated movies used to have, simply disappeared. But Aladdin puled it off............ the story, although changed a bit, was still entertaining and the music made sense. Aladdin was likable, nice and funny, and the evil Jaffar was a classic villain we expect to find in a story like this. I've seen this movie a thousand times. When it came out I was about 13. My parents bought the tape and my brother, sister and I watched it almost every other day .... it was fun then .... sometimes you realize that things you liked so mush when you were a kid are not as good when you grow up, but Aladdin still is :)",
278,7 May 2006,Parchipex,8, Aladdin,"I just recently watched Aladdin on my DVD. I enjoyed the crystal-clear, completely restored picture and the movie itself was very enjoyable. Young Aladdin plays a ""street rat"" who must steal to get his food but still has a good heart (in one scene we see him give his hard-earned food to some hungry little children.) When he becomes trapped in a cave of wonders, he meets the goofy genie who can grant him three wishes, and I don't want to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it so I'll leave it at that. The voices, especially the Genie's (done by Robin Williams) and Iago the parrot (none other than Gilbert Gottfried- I think I spelled that right...)are good and the story is a very enjoyable one. The songs were very catchy. One thing I didn't like was how on the DVD they have all these extra features- on the second disk there is tons of stuff about how the movie was made and the characters were designed and things like that. However, I'm sure some people might find these things interesting so it's up to your opinion. I did like the deleted songs and scenes and when they gave reasons for why they didn't put them into the film. All in all I recommend this movie because (here comes the corny part) it has potential for becoming a family favorite in your household.",

Yes I am one of those people from the time before cell phones and computers. LOL. I have found this film to be magical on so many level. I always felt there was a tremendous message about being who you are and loving who you are no matter where you come from. I have always loved the music and song of the entire film which is very rare for me. I love that the film was humorous, touching, and highly entertaining. Princess Jasmine is not a typical Disney princess of the past ""looking for a prince to rescue her"" as her character has a voice and is strong and not dependent on a ""man"" to save her. Robin Williams is brilliant as the genie and wonderfully over the top. Aladdin is my all time favorite character who is representative of someone who wants love and happiness as we all do and he learns that ""money"" does not buy that. There is so much in this film about truth, honesty, and integrity. When he frees the genie as his last wish I cry every time.",

The songs and music in general are just great and very memorable. Jafar is a great villain mainly because he is voiced by Jonathan Freeman who has got a good and scary voice. But what is maybe the best element of the movie is Robin Williams as the blue genie. The blue genie is like a jokemachine that once it is started can't stop again and keeps you laughing.",

No! This movie's horrible. I don't understand why it is considered to be one of the best Disney movies ever made, it is just really bad. I've never seen a Disney movie so bad as Aladdin next to The Nightmare Before Christmas & Oliver & Company. Stay Away! It's overrated.

290,1 May 2013,moviecritichank-7,10, Solid Gold Disney Classic!!!,"Aladdin is Disney's 31st full-length animated feature film released in 1992. Based on the popular Arab folktale, the film follows a young peasant boy named Aladdin (voice by Scott Weinger) and his sidekick Abu (voiced by Frank Welker) who are in search of a life outside of the streets from stealing food and dodging guards every day. Then one day, they meet the beautiful Princess Jasmine (voiced by Linda Larkin) in the marketplace and after they save her life, they take her to their place and realize that she wants the exact opposite of what they want; a normal life outside of the palace walls. Then, after Aladdin is thrown into prison by the evil Sorcerer Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman), he is unknowingly taken to the Cave of Wonders by Jafar (disguised as an old beggar man) and his wisecracking sidekick Iago to find an ancient magic lamp that unleashes a genie that grants three wishes. After Aladdin and Abu find the lamp and narrowly escape the Cave on the Magic Carpet, they are thrown back into the cave as it crumbles in the ground. In the process however, Abu grabs the magic lamp, gives it to Aladdin and he accidentally rubs the lamp and unleashes the energetic, hilariously funny Genie (voiced by Robin Williams from ""Good Morning, Vietnam"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"") and chaos ensues!!! This was Disney's fourth film of the Renaissance Era and it's has every element of a classic Disney movie present: great story, unforgettable characters (including one of the best Disney villains of all-time, Jafar), great animation, suspense, great climax, and an awesome score/songs composed by famed Disney composers Alan Menken and Tim Rice (stepping in place of Howard Ashman). The best songs in the movie are ""One Jump Ahead"", ""Prince Ali"", and ""A Whole New World"", played during the magic carpet ride scene. This is yet another one of my favorite Disney movies and my favorite character is the Genie! If you by any chance haven't seen this classic American animated film in the last 20+ years it's been out, all I have to say is: WATCH IT!!!

The plot of this movie is that Princess Jasmine is supposed to get married to a prince but every prince she meets always want the same things and she doesn't like any of them. When she found Aladdin she really liked him because he was different, he wasn't a rich snotty boy, he was poor and he cared about her, all of the rest didn't make it seem like they really cared about her... she trusted Aladdin with her life because he saved her. He is a pure hearted young man who would do anything for the poor or hurt. He is a pure hearted person.

But one day, they give a hand to a lovely young person who happens to be Princess Jasmine. Love at first sight, but with not much hope: Princess Jasmine refused so many potential husbands that her father has decided to marry her to the devilish Jafar, his counselor. And anyway, a Princess cannot marry a commoner. Fortunately, Aladdin finds a magic lamp, in which there is a Genie. That will definitely change the situation. Walt Disney features, mirrors of our times, are losing in humanity what they gain in high tech effects. In the case of this so much revised version of the 1001 nights legends, the result is impressive for sure and Robin Williams is a treat. One just feels a little melancholic when comparing with the great classics of the 50's, so much purer, richer, lovable in a word",

It had excellent animation, great voice actors, songs were amazing, and really good characters. I loved every moment of watching it The animation is excellent. When Aladdin came out, they thought it was going to be a huge flop because of the success of beauty and the beast earlier that year. Well it did very well even the animation was great. who ever thought Disney could create excellent scenery for a sandy dessert, a tiger talking cave, a market place, and a flying carpet? Great voice actors all i can say. This proves that Disney doesn't need a list celeberties to play their characters. Yes Aladdin had Robin Wiliams and Scott weigner (steve from FullHouse) and most people probably knew the voice of Iago (forget how to spell his name)and the rest weren't very well known however you don't need well known voice actors to create great characters.",

Aladdin, the main character, owns a monkey named Abu. Early in the movie, he, by chance, ends up meeting the princess, Jasmine, who is in disguise because she wants to get out of the palace where she lives and experience life on the outside in the real world. She doesn't like it in the palace because it is confining and she is not able to make her own choices. For example, she must find a husband by her next birthday per the local law. While they are hanging out, Aladdin is arrested for stealing bread from earlier. He is taken to the dungeon. Her pleas to let him go fall on empty ears because the palace guards are under the orders of Jafar, an evil sorcerer who works for the King, Jasmine's father. They do not disclose to him or to her whether they are there specifically to arrest him. Later, while Aladdin is in shackles, Jafar sneaks into his cell disguised as an old peasant donning a gold tooth and hobbling around on a wooden cane that looks like a giant corkscrew. In exchange for Aladdin's assistance in finding treasure, this magic lamp, Jafar says that he will help Aladdin escape. He begrudgingly agrees. What else is he supposed to do?!

Its my all- time favourite movie and I never tire of watching it millions of times (I'm 17). Every moment is 'red-letter'!!!! I love it so much that I can't even express how good it is right now, but I'll give it a go. Firstly, its totally original and not the stereotypical 'fairytale' like previous Disney films. Its fresh and modern and simply fizzes with energy and light humour. The animation is really special, because the style is unique, too. All the characters are voiced so amazingly that you adore all of them, even the villain Jafar but particularly the Genie- he's a champ. The music is one of Disney's best as well- every song is a favourite of mine, particularly 'A Whole New World'. Aladdin is definitely one of those movies where you know and recite along to all the words and songs because it feels natural that way. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't just sit there reading this, actually buy it!!! You won't regret it- the second disc has stacks of great special features- you have to check it out and see for yourself because its definitely worth it.",

I along with many other critics, have been their biggest faultfinders. However, Aladdin is clever, funny, has amazing themes, a beautiful soundtrack, and is a very satisfying movie.",
317,19 September 2008,Harley66,6, A Fun Children's Story,"The story of Aladdin, from a collection of stories dating back more than a millennium, has been filmed dozens of times in dozens of variations. However, none was ever filmed as creatively, humorously and family friendly as Disney Studios did in 1992. The success of the movie owes much to the talents of Robin Williams, whose manic impersonations and characterizations propel this movie along at a frantic pace. Disney also kept the story of Aladdin and Princess Jasmine simple, helping the appeal of the movie. This story is relatively simple, cutting out much of the detail from the original story. Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weinger), is a teenager trying to find enough to eat in Baghdad. Though Aladdin steals food and is a bit of a rogue, he also has a sense of fairness, honor and innocence, a ""diamond in the rough"" that evil Grand Vizier Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman) needs to enter the Cave of Wonders to steal the magic lamp. Aladdin enters the cave and finds the lamp, but uses the lamp to escape and become Prince Ali in an attempt to win the heart and hand of Princess Jasmine (voiced by Linda Larkin). As we learn early in the movie, Princess Jasmine wants nothing to do with phonies and princes; she is looking for someone to whom she can give her heart, someone who will understand and love her. Prince Ali is not that person. Jafar wants the power of being the Sultan of Baghdad. His plan is simple, get the lamp, gain absolute power, marry Jasmine, and take over the world; not necessarily in that order. I would be remiss if I failed to mention Jafar's trusty adviser Iago the Parrot, voiced by the always obnoxious and, certainly in the case of this movie, funny Gilbert Gottfried. Perhaps if Jafar had not had a parrot as an adviser, things might have turned out different for him. The animation in this edition of the movie is marvelous. The colors are bright and images are quite clear. This movie is excellent to watch on your big screen television. Another wonderful feature of this movie is the music. The standout song is ""A Whole New World,"" but I also liked ""Prince Ali"" and ""One Jump Ahead."" Alan Menken's score and Tim Rice's music garnered an Oscar for Menken and an Oscar for Menken and Rice. In fact, this movie won 22 significant awards and was nominated for another 15. Aladdin is a good guy trying to survive in a tough world. Princess Jasmine is naïve and innocent. Aladdin's love for Jasmine is pure and teenage and children and teenagers everywhere will identify with Aladdin's angst. The song and dance routines of the Robin Williams' Genie keep the overall tone of this movie light, which is necessary to help balance the evil of Grand Vizier Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman). I recommend this movie for all members of the family except for the very youngest members, who may be frightened by the images of Jafar and the Genie is a couple of the scenes. Most children ages 4 and above should be able to watch this movie with little difficulty. Enjoy!",

After being thrown in cell he comes across a mysterious old man who lets Aladdin in on a secret - a secret cave in the desert that contains riches beyond Aladdin's wildest dreams. Little does Aladdin know, he is the ""diamond in the rough"", the one person that can enter this cave and retrieve the lamp that this old man, whose identity will be revealed in the film, is after. It follows the magical and extravagant life of Aladdin alongside his trusty monkey friend Abu and his new friends, Carpet and Genie and with Aladdin trying to catch the eye of the lonely Princess Jasmine all sorts of mischief can happen. Feel your heartbeat race as you watch this exciting storyline unfold with all sorts of twists and turns on the way. Robin Williams is brilliant as the genie and a fantastic soundtrack, which I own, makes this Disney movie an absolute classic. I recommend this to Lush people who want an enchanted afternoon film. A Whole New World is now a classic and could only be improved with someone like Kelly Clarkson and Mark Pakula's vocals but that's a different story.",

323,13 June 2017,godhatesharper,9, Entirely entertaining 25 years later,"Aladdin is a thoroughly entertaining film, with the theme of being ""trapped"" resonant across all demographics. This is probably the funniest Disney film of the '90s, with a large part of that owing to Robin Williams' ostentatious genie. The incessant references might date the film a little--in fact, I believe Aladdin may be the first children's animation showcasing the trend of gratuitous pop culture references for the sake of a knowing laugh--But I digress, for the movie does manage to find comedy in other places too. Jafar, for example, is probably the perfect Disney villain: sarcastic, maleficent, and creepy as all hell. He inspires most of the action scenes, which are exhilarating and suspenseful mostly because they have a sense of real urgency; Aladdin doesn't just slip out without having a few (or 10) close calls. Many people have complained about Jasmine and Aladdin being bland stock characters, but I don't see that, especially for Jasmine. She was probably the most autonomous Disney princess at the time, and she has grace and charm without being simpering and dependent. All of the characters here are entertaining; even the notoriously grating Gilbert Gottfried as Iago garners quite a few laughs. ",
324,29 March 2009,hannahbananacheetahgirl,4, Disney Could have given me better,"I just recently watched Aladdin for the first time(I'm 15). For some reason, though we owned many Disney movies, Aladdin was never one of them and I was very excited to watch it. I was thoroughly disappointed. The animation was good, but Jasmine looked like an Arabian stripper. What message does this send to the young girls that watch it? Also, the Sultan exclaims many comments about Allah. So, they'll put in comments about Allah but they won't ever put in anything about God? Robin Williams has always freaked me out, so imagining him as the genie kind of ruined the character. They condoned stealing and sneakiness, but maybe it's just the way I view it. Also, I didn't like that they put in very modern stuff for a very early time. I mean, a Disney vacation for an ancient genie? It made the movie kind of cheesy. Overall, I think that, after masterpieces like Beauty and the Beast and the Lion King, Disney could have done justice to a wonderful setting like Arabia.",

332,19 July 2019,qoodog,10, My favorite movie,"Aladdin is my favorite movie because of three reasons.
First, the kindness of Aladdin. The most impressive scene is that Aladdin gives poor children bread which he managed to steel. Aladdin is a true gentleman because he is also poor and he doesn't have enough money and food but he did such lines behavior.
Second, the appeal of Genie. I love the scene of Genie's entrance. He comes out from the lamp and starts talking with his pace. And you ciuld be involved in his strange world with his singing and using many magics rhythmically. It could make you happy and smile.
Third, the friendship between Aladdin and Genie. The best scene you could understand the friendship is that Aladdin fights with Jafar and put him into a lamp forever. In this scene, Genie's master is not Aladdin but Jafar. So, Genie couldn't help Aladdin. However, he seems to want to help Aladdin. Finally, Aladdin win the fight with Jafar. I think the key of the victory is the best friendship of them. Aladdin really wants Genie to be free so, he come up with the great idea to win Jafar.
Aladdin makes a last wish that is not for himself but for Genie to be free. He could do that behavior because of his kindness and their friendship. And Aladdin could marry Jasmine without Genie's power. I think someone who is kind to others will be very happy someday. This movie tells you what makes you happy is not money but kind to others.",

335,11 February 2012,d-novacek,7, That's so true!,"Just watched this recently, on the new-and-improved DVD which features a restored print, and it looks spectacular. The story is slightly shallower than the best of Disney's films, but this is balanced by the sheer lunacy of Robin Williams' bad, blue Genie. Whoever first thought of putting Robin Williams in a Disney flick should get a Pulitzer, or a Nobel, or something. The comic timing of his riffs combined with the comic timing of the animators transform the Genie from a ""Deus Ex Machina"" into the soul of ""Aladdin."" I have a tiny issue with the fact that the most recent VHS and DVD prints of the movie have bowed to pressure from activist groups and altered a line in the opening song. The original line was, ""...where they cut if your ear if they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" The revised line reads, ""...where the land is immense and the heat is intense/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" Protesters claimed the original line perpetuated a negative stereotype of Arab countries and peoples. But...but...but marketplaces and cities in Arabian countries still cut the hands off convicted thieves. And there's even a scene in the film which threatens to relieve the princess of an appendage. They're not being negative; they're being accurate. And, oh yeah, IT'S A CARTOON. But that's just my opinion.",
