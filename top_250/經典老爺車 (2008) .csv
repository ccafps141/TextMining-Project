1,22 March 2009,Smells_Like_Cheese,9, Clint's best performance since Million Dollar Baby,"I saw Gran Torino opening weekend and after hearing rave reviews, I was looking forward to it. After seeing it, I realized what people were excited about, it was Clint's performance, this is a man you do not want to mess with. He's the perfect good guy with a bad guy's lust for vengeance. I love his growls, he sounds like a great guard dog, I would love to just have him by my door if a salesman comes by to make that noise. I can't believe what a triple threat Clint is: he's a writer, director, and an actor, not to mention that he's great at all three of them. He presents Gran Torino with grace and style of an old man that society has forgotten about because of his bad mood not realizing that deep down, he's truly a good man.",r
2,16 December 2008,woljm45,10, Clint Eastwood shows you why he still should be in FRONT of the camera,"With his performance Eastwood shows you why people like himself, Jack Nicholson, or Paul Newman only come around once in a lifetime. Though Eastwood would rather focus on directing, he can still carry a movie with his on screen presence, and he's pure dynamite in ""Gran Torino"". Perhaps the poor box office results of ""hollywoody"" movies like Absolute Power, True Crime, Space Cowboys, and Blood Work, caused Eastwood to shy away from acting, but given cutting edge material to work with as ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Gran Torino"", he's as good as ever. His character as the racist and salty war vet makes you think of that old guy we've all had on our blocks with the garbage door open, the million tools hanging everywhere, and always fixing or building something. I found myself not wanting the movie to end because the scenes between himself and the various Hmong characters where priceless. There may be complaints over the racist remarks and scenes, but Eastwood pulls it off in a way a real person like that would talk or act to a point where it ends up being lighthearted. I'm not going to give the plot away, but if you like your Clint Eastwood as a hard-nosed tough guy with foul language alla Dirty Harry or Heartbreak Ridge, you'll love this movie!!",e

4,13 December 2008,Len9876,10," Another top-notch, Clint Eastwood film that entertains and teaches.","Manohla Dargis writes in the New York Times: ""Dirty Harry is back, in a way, in ""Gran Torino,"" not as a character but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film, in its themes and high-caliber imagery, and of course most obviously in Mr. Eastwood's face. It is a monumental face now, so puckered and pleated that it no longer looks merely weathered, as it has for decades, but seems closer to petrified wood. Words like flinty and steely come to mind, adjectives that Mr. Eastwood ... expressively embodies with his usual lack of fuss and a number of growls."" More praise for Eastwood comes from Joe Morgenstern in the Wall Street Journal, who comments: ""No one makes movies like Gran Torino any more, and more's the pity. This one, with Clint Eastwood as director and star, is concerned with honor and atonement, with rough justice and the family of man. It raises irascibility to the level of folk art, takes unapologetic time-outs for unfashionable moral debates, revives acting conventions that haven't been in fashion for half a century and keeps you watching every frame as Mr. Eastwood snarls, glowers, mutters, growls and grins his way through the performance of a lifetime."" Elizabeth Weitzman in the New York Daily News remarks that ""it's clearly a career-capping work."" Kenneth Turan in The Los Angeles Times writes that the movie ""is impossible to imagine without the actor in the title role. The notion of a 78-year-old action hero may sound like a contradiction in terms, but Eastwood brings it off, even if his toughness is as much verbal as physical. Even at 78, Eastwood can make 'Get off my lawn' sound as menacing as 'Make my day,' and when he says 'I blow a hole in your face and sleep like a baby,' he sounds as if he means it.""",i
5,16 November 2011,TheLittleSongbird,9, A very well done and powerful film,"I saw Gran Torino mainly as an admirer of Clint Eastwood, both as an actor and as director. And I was very impressed, there were parts that amused me and others that had me moved. Gran Torino was a very well made and beautifully directed movie, complete with a fitting soundtrack, a strong script with smooth enough tone shifts and a powerful message that is well conveyed and one that I think many, myself included, would identify with. The story is mostly engaging with an interesting protagonist, but there are a few moments where it is hackneyed and predictable, which is my only criticism of this movie. In regard to the acting, Clint Eastwood gives a very commanding performance and the kids are also very good mostly. Overall, very well done. 9/10 Bethany Cox",e
6,27 January 2009,Simon_Says_Movies,9, Sour Humour and Pure Badassery,"If movies like Indiana Jones, Iron Man and The Dark Knight were the thoroughbred hits of 2008, then Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino is the dark horse. This rousing crowd-pleaser is sure to surprise many, through its copious sour humour and pure badassery, while managing to still be an affecting and sombre dramatic entry in Eastwood's long-enduring and wildly successful career in front of and behind the camera.",w
7,15 December 2008,come2whereimfrom,8, Great whether in front or behind the camera.,"Hot on the heels of 'Changeling' Eastwood is back and as well as directing he is back in front of the camera. He plays Walt Kowalski a recently widowed ex-Vietnam veteran who harbours slight racism and bitterness which isn't helped by the changing world he now lives in alone. He has relatives but they only seem to call when they want something and his grandkids have already started deciding what they will have of his when he dies. He has a few mates he drinks with in the pub but other than that his neighbourhood is being overrun by immigrants and gang warfare. Walt's next door neighbours are a Hmong family with no father figure and after the son tries to steal his prize car, the 'Grand Torino' of the title, Walt decides to try and reform the boy and hopefully as time passes learn about their culture and change his mind before he dies. As with all Eastwood films where you begin isn't where you will end up and the story takes many turns that will test all of your emotions, I laughed, I cried and I got angry it's a real roller-coaster. But its Clint's aged 'Dirty Harry' in Walt that steals the show and anytime he is on screen he is mesmerising which means that the supporting cast members are barely noticeable. At times it plays like Lynch's 'Straight Story' with sprinkles of 'Taxi Driver' but the real beauty is in the old fashioned storytelling, something that Clint is a dab hand at, mix that with the modern day context and you have a gripping and enthralling film. It's no wonder that so many 'best of year' lists contain this film, they should, it is that good and it proves that even at 78 Eastwood is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to movies in front or behind the camera or in the case of 'Grand Torino' both.",/
8,24 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,9, This unusual Eastwood drama turns out to be one of his very best films,"Once rumoured to be another film in the DIRTY HARRY saga, GRAN TORINO is actually much, much more than a crime film. It's not even an action film, or a thriller, despite containing elements from those genres: in actual fact, it's a solid human drama about human relationships, along with ruminations on plenty of issues affecting today's world: immigration, integration into society, crime, violence, friendship, life and death, regret. I can't imagine anyone but Clint Eastwood starring in this film. Eastwood plays his usual character, except older, more frail than more; perhaps the word I'm thinking of is 'more human'. Whatever, he's absolutely astounding in this film, giving a brilliant performance as Walt Kowalski, a foul-mouthed, irritable old racist who gradually uncovers his humanity as the story progresses.",r

The movie takes you on a roller-coaster ride and the entire theater stood up in applause afterward. I highly recommend this film and if Eastwood doesn't get nominated for an Oscar something is truly wrong!!! The screening I saw was held at the Writer's Guild, so the room was filled with SAG, WGA, DGA, and other industry related people who I would wage know their movies.

'Gran Torino' is a very smart and hugely enjoyable drama film with a brilliant ending that tops off what is a truly great story.",6
17,8 January 2010,planktonrules,10, Like morphing Archie Bunker with Dirty Harry...this one is full of surprises.,"The movie begins with Clint Eastwood's wife dying. You can immediately see that he's a nasty old man who has little, if any, connection with his kids and grandkids (some of which ARE pretty unlikable). He also lives in a community that is now filled with Asians and Chicanos (and gangs) and he hates them—and they don't particularly like him either. At this point, it's hard to like the crusty old guy. He's nasty to the well-meaning priest that's trying to help him cope with the wife's death and he just wants everyone to leave him alone.",/
18,23 July 2020,schroederagustavo,9, Gran Torino Review,"A very good Eastwood movie, both in terms of performance and direction by the man himself. It has, I think, a great message about today's youth, the values that society used to hold, back when men used to be men, about redemption and about judging other people by the content of their character, rather than the color of their skin. The only thing I see holding down this otherwise great film, is sometimes the dialogue of the film and the stereotypes that the family of Eastwood's character plays are a little too ""on the nose"". The family, for example, filled with ungrateful people with no values whatsoever who are only interested in what will happen to Walt's possessions as soon as he dies, often seem caricatures, characters overly simplified in order for the message to come across that they are soulless creatures and to place the emphasis that Walt comes to value and grow a much better relationship with his Asian neighbors, despite all of his initial racism and prejudice towards them. But putting that aside, Gran Torino is truly a very good film, perhaps one of Eastwood's best.",?

In 2006, he revisited the Second World War with great lucidity and critical sense, in this case the American campaign in the Pacific, with The Conquest of Honor and Letters from Iwo Jima, shot in sequence.

29,13 December 2008,olofsson501,9, A great feel-good movie with both comedy and tragedy at the same time,"This movie made me laugh and cry at the same time. It deals with both grimy old bastards as well as with more serious matters as racism. Good acting from Clind as well as all his supporting actors and once again Clint has shown that he is capable of making movies that involves both emotions and stereotypes! The ""olidish"" bitterness of Clint's character and the mix between comedy and drama is just genius. The only criticism of the movie would be that the gang-bangers were pretty and does not correspond very well to all of the reports of gang violence all around the world. But overall I thought this was a great movie with lots of potential for being one of those films that you will actually remember when you visit the video rental store in five years from now.",v

He is one of the last Caucasian Americans in his neighborhood and does not have good relationship with his sons and their families; therefore he is a lonely man. When his teenager neighbor Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang) is pressed by his cousin Smokie (Sonny Vu) to join his Hmong gang, he is assigned to steal the Gran Torino of Walt as part of his initiation in the gang. However he is surprised by the old man and his traditional family feels ashamed with the incident. Later Walt saves Thao first and his sister Sue Lor (Ahney Her) later from gangs and he has the gratitude of his next door neighbors and the Asian neighborhood. On the day of his birthday, Walt is invited by Sue to join her family reunion and he begins a relationship with his neighbors, helping Thao to get a job. However he realizes that the Hmong gang disturbs the neighborhood and after a coward attack of the gangsters to Sue, Walt decides to take an ultimate attitude.",

From his grit your teeth spaghetti westerns, to Dirty Harry, to Unforgiven Eastwood has shown us WHAT movies are supposed to be. The steely eyed gaze, gruff groveled voice full of growls, grunts and innuendos serves the story of the film right to a tee. Not only does Eastwood serve as Director and Producer he gives a powerful and driven performance as a Korean War vet who for a better lack of words is stuck in those times. He believes in being a soldier, the flag and hates foreigners. ",
32,26 September 2010,classicsoncall,10," ""The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do"".","As great as Clint Eastwood was in all the films spanning his career, I have to believe that he's even greater as a director. In ""Gran Torino"", his Walt Kowalski could have been portrayed as one dimensional a character as the Stranger With No Name or Dirty Harry. Instead, Eastwood plays a conflicted retiree suffering the loss of his wife and the disintegration of his neighborhood while staving off the attempt of a parish priest to fulfill a promise to a dying woman. It would have been easy to convert Kowalski from a die-hard bigot to a reborn and reinvigorated Christian, but the film doesn't take that easy way out. This reluctant neighborhood hero never aspires to put aside his prejudice, but he does know the difference between right and wrong. I think that's why I admire the film so much. For justice to be truly color blind, one has to act on the impulse of what's right, not who's right. The first time I saw the film, I pretty much figured out what Kowalski was going to do. Knowing that he was dying, Walt sought out his personal peace with the Padre and insulated Thao from the chaos that was about to ensue. What I didn't count on was the measure of self sacrifice that would crystallize the character of this man who had killed in war, but had carried that haunting inside himself for a half century. Walt Kowalski would achieve justice on his terms without compromise, but with immense self sacrifice. Truly a neighborhood hero, the kind that destroys racial stereotypes instead of merely knocking them down.",

37,15 December 2008,AudioFileZ,10, One Man's Unexpected Path To Redemption.,"Clint Eastwood has certainly turned out to the best ""double-threat"" actor/director in Hollywood. As he has so often, here he once again portrays a very conflicted man. To complicate things as the story begins we see him at the funeral for his wife. The movie wastes no time in our realization that Walt Kowalski has been an volatile island his entire adult life who likely was reined in by the balance his better half just barely was able to provide. Without her it seems he just may veer into the abyss as everything around him seems to be in some state of decay.",
38,9 July 2009,GoldmundX,3, Did Eastwood's sense of quality take a holiday?,"Eastwood has shown us many times before he understands the art of movie-making. That's why it's so confusing to see he was able to make such an embarrassing, almost amateuristic movie. Yes, in the beginning of the movie some of the over the top grumpy, racist, cynical one-liners are quite amusing, but then it just turns into an embarrassing spectacle of bad acting, bad writing, bad editing, just bad movie-making. The acting of the girl, and especially the boy next door are just gutwrenching to watch. My head was spinning by such a display of amateurism. I try to understand how on earth they could have ended up in an Eastwood movie. Are they his adopted children or children of friends or something? For sure he's doing somebody a huge favor to include them in the movie. Some of the scenes are really beyond bad. What's up with him connecting with the Asian kids by fixing the washing machine in the basement? The whole idea of the scene is stupid and embarrassing, let alone the execution of it. And than the scene when they are waiting for the girl, not sure what happened to her. Eastwood stares at his hand saying (something like) ""at least in Korea we were expecting to loose one of us"".... Can it get more cheesy than that? I didn't know whether I should laugh or cry. And than the scenes with the barber. The initial idea works out well and amusing - the barber and Eastwood doing their grumpy routine. But than they try and milk the idea and even introduce the boy (deprived of all acting skills) into their 'domain of real men' to teach him the way of Men (to curse). It just gets so embarrassing, you just want to leave the theater and get drunk to simply destroy the brain cells that stored the whole thing, to save you from uncomfortable flashbacks for the rest of your life. Let's just hope mr. Eastwood had a blackout, let's just hope his sense of quality returns and let's hope the majority of IMDb-ers grow a sense of quality so 'movies' like this don't end up in the top 100 of all time again.",
39,14 January 2009,arcticcarrot,3, Clint Eastwood's character is interesting; the rest is garbage,"This movie has so many problems that I'm not sure where to begin. So i'll simply mention things as they come to be, rather than in chronological order. The first thing that has to go from this film is the awful scene at the barbershop where Clint is trying to teach Thao how to interact with people. Awful, awful, awful, and it goes on and on, and then it ends with the lamest joke about anal sex with some carpenters. Actually, all the barbershop scenes can go, because the only thing they accomplish is to show that Clint's character makes racist remarks even with his friends. But we get that from the scene with the Irish foreman. The priest should have been recast. That said, the scene near the end when the priest just walks right into Clint's house is terrible. The whole movie the priest has been calling Clint's character by his first name, and Clint keeps correcting him, asking to be called Mr. Kowalski, and then predictably in this late scene the priest calls him Mr. Kowalski, and Clint says, ""Call me Walt."" Awful. And nothing is accomplished in the scene anyway. The editing is poor also. Scenes that have ended continue for a few more moments. For example, the scene where Sue is being hassled by three black guys is over once Clint gets her into his truck and they drive away. But the scene continues with a crane shot of the three guys walking away and talking about Clint. What do we care what these guys think of him? The scene is over, move on. Okay, now for some real spoilers... The end is completely retarded. Clint's character should not die that way. After all, his standing up to the gang earlier should have empowered the neighborhood to take a stand. They should have reported the names of the guys who raped and beat Sue. Instead, Clint goes on a suicide mission, somehow knowing that only then would people tell the police what's been going on. Someone says, ""This time there were witnesses."" Well, hell, there were witnesses every time, but no one was willing to speak up. Why should they now? It's ridiculous. And then of course the kid inherits the stupid car. Who cares? What he should have inherited was the tools. The tools are what really brought those two characters together; the tools are what will be useful to him in allowing him to get on with his life. The movie is plagued by some of the worst acting i've ever seen in a film. The bit where Thao is locked in Clint's basement and he's demanding to be let out had the whole audience laughing, and it was supposed to be a serious moment. I don't understand why people love this film. My only guess is that the vast majority of film-goers are morons. Oh well.",

How on Earth I never got round to seeing it I've no idea . It's highly regarded by my peers on this website and it's by Eastwood who if nothing else is an inspiration in the way he constantly churns out movies without pausing for breath . He might not be on a par with Scorsese or Aronofsky but he's definitely not some third rate journeyman hack director who thinks he's doing an MTV ident while over dosing on cocaine which seems to be the in house Hollywood directorial style these days .

His transformation hinges on a single incident which I won't give away but it is certainly one which audiences can relate to. It seems a little easy and maybe it is but Clint gives such an excellent performance that he sells it.

There isn't. Depicting an oddball and a dinosaur who turns out to be able to learn things and teach things may be entertaining, but unless it brings something new to the table, it isn't philosophy. This is a movie about redemption, but in the end, the main character, who is initially depicted as a thinker and a secretly religious man, claims redemption and salvation by denying all hope of redemption and salvation to other (admittedly evil) characters. For me, this just didn't work and the contradiction ruined the movie for me. The character just would not have done that. He was neither stupid nor selfish.",
48,31 August 2009,nanturn,7, Not Among Eastwood's Best,"Although I am a big fan of Eastwood and have enjoyed most of his films, I found Gran Torino to be overly sentimental and I'm confused by the high IMDb rating. The plot thread is almost banal - why would the tough Asian gang devote so much effort in pursuit of the teenage boy who did not want to be a member? and lacked credibility - the sick old man was able to intimidate these gang members? and is too familiar - hardened racist comes around, honorable man sacrifices his life for justice and absolves himself of past sins through his last actions on earth, etc., etc. And I disagree with the comment that viewers were permitted to 'make up our own minds'. In this film, the moral of the story was in the viewer's face and an emotional response was overtly solicited. Compared to Unforgiven, a film that was both powerful and subtle, and avoided obvious moral judgments, Gran Torino is an amateurish piece.",

That aside the movie was terrible. Not because of writing flaws or cheesy one liners, like I expected, but because besides good old Clint, no one in this movie bothered to act. It was bazaar. Clint was spectacular, but everyone else looked like they were just reciting words on a page. I've seen better performances at middles school Shakespeare shows. The preacher had only one emotion, and it was so vague and useless that I couldn't actually understand anything he did. The bad guys were comical at best and the loyal friend, Toad, or what ever, was so unconvincingly angry that I just wanted Clint to let him out of the cage and get killed so I wouldn't have to watch him pretend he was enraged.

53,8 March 2009,pyrocitor,6, Eastwood's towering performance rises above a rare directorial misfire,"Clint Eastwood's film-making career has led credulity to the cliché that some things only get better with age, showing a transcendent self-awareness and reflective grasp for supremely genuine emotional storytelling and allegorical commentary on America, and the steadily fading beacons of past moral values. As such, it is difficult to envision a more fitting cinematic project than Gran Torino, addressing traditional Eastwood themes of age, morality and changing times through an unrepentant racist of a protagonist forced to rethink his prejudices when confronted with close interaction of a Hmong teenager after an attempted theft of his prized 1972 Gran Torino. However, despite all initial signs looking exceptionally promising (with Eastwood's vicious growl of ""GET OFF MY LAWN"" in the film's trailer delightfully hearkening back to the days of Dirty Harry sadistic cool), it is all the more disappointing to see Gran Torino somewhat miss its mark, falling short of the modern masterpiece it easily could have been.

This captivating drama starring the iconic actor as well as directed him isn't quite up the par with his legendary works, and can be easily be seen as just one of his minor pieces; but the energy he delivers from both his acting and directorial skills still deserve our attention. Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a disgruntled Korean War veteran who's just lost his beloved wife and now lives alone in a depressed state. The old man chooses to alienate himself from everyone including his family, and can't bare to have anyone in his property, particularly a Korean family who moves in next door in the racially diverse neighborhood.

When he ends up having to deal with an Asian family from the Hmong area who live next door, however, because of the teenage son's attempt to steal his prized car whose title is this movie's name, Walt feels a bond that grows complicated when a gang (one of whose members is the family's cousin) tries to bully this son and his sister. As this brother and sister, Be Vang as Thao Vang Lor and Ahney Her as Sue Lor give pretty good performances considering their inexperience before the camera. The same goes for many of the other Hmong players. And Clint is fine making this somewhat racist character lovable because of his sense of honor and decency. In fact, the most humorously edgy scene concerns Eastwood, Vang, and a barber played by John Carroll Lynch as Walt tries to prepare Thao for suitable-if politically incorrect-male adult conversation. I also loved the conversation between Walt and Sue after he picked her up from a near-assault from a black gang.

Eastwood stars as a war veteran recently widowed and disturbed when an Asian family moves in next door. When a gang threatens their lives he becomes involved and viewed as a hero. Wonderful portrait of self sacrifice directed by and starring Eastwood. Eastwood is known for portraying characters of great nobility and here he makes it his ultimate standoff. He has isolated himself from family since his wife's passing but the Church she attended makes unappreciated visits. Strong supporting work by Bee Vang who is in with the wrong crowd but discipline places him within the realm of great character and reward. Ahney Her is attacked by the gang but will find refuge in Eastwood. Christopher Carley plays his deceased wife's pastor whom Eastwood doesn't care for until he needs questions answered. On the minor negative end, the antagonist gang are more or less types over personalities. These scenes are provocative and portray one's curiosity with regards to faith. Very powerful and one of Eastwood's greatest films. It presents themes of forgiveness and self sacrifice where good triumphs over evil and the innocent is rewarded the ultimate set of wheels. Score: 9 ½ / 10",
103,5 September 2018,heisenberg12,9, Instant Classic,"Although Gran Torino is not perfect, it is an extremely good movie that adheres to simple, proven-to-work story structure with a tight script, strong characters, heartfelt meaning, and relatable themes like friendship, nostalgia, life and death, and the American dream, in addition to having lots of fun with the contrasts in generations and nationalities. There are a few errors, and it's a shame because if it wasn't for them then this would be a masterpiece. It's still mightily close, and is still definitely an Eastwood classic and possibly one of the most important movies in recent decades. Beautiful movie with a beautiful ending.",

How many more contrived scenes with racial slurs and name calling can story-tellers come up with - it began to remind of Crash unfortunately. Luckily the movie pulls out of it midway to develop an interesting story-line with grumpy-old-racist Wally and his Hmong neighbors. Eastwood is pretty much Oscar-the-Grouch for the whole movie, and the humor is dryly funny at first, but it wears pretty thin after repetition. I didn't think too highly of support acting from the brother Tao and especially the sister Sue , but they deserve a bit of slack being first-timers I suppose. Also, why do lead characters need to die to bring more meaning to things? Awfully clichéd - Wally doesn't need to die. Eastwood is good as Wally - though dry, sarcastic, angry. So it's a mixed bag I thought. If you're an Eastwood fan, you might enjoy it.",

Clint's racism and bigot-ism is SO one dimensional and over the top that it feels completely phony. His character arc(the transition from racist to racist with a heart) also feels quite forced. The acting was literally embarrassing for just about every character but Clint. No one could deliver a darn line in this movie. They all felt like first time actors!(their ethnic backgrounds weren't the reason...the Father and Clints son's were the same way and they were white.) The humor was so generic, completely dependent on the impact of one liners....situations quite void of laughs. The antagonists were only in the film just enough to know who Clint is going to have to face at the end of the movie, but nothing more than that to make any kind of impact in the film. How about giving them some personality and a reason to be the baddies they are? How about maybe attempting to make them come off 3 dimensional?

An ambitious year for Eastwood as a director with this film coming at the heels of his critically acclaimed ""Changeling"" he goes in front of the camera to deliver yet another classic Eastwood character. At age 78 he plays a crusty bigot who is at odds with his grown sons and their families and the modern world in general. Filled with great lines from a story by Dave Johannson and screenplay by Nick Schenk it's got to be the wittiest drama ever.

At 78, you wouldn't want to cross his path down a dark alley, or even just in a diner, without paying some proper respects. It's his presence, if nothing else, that makes Gran Torino compulsively watchable. It may be flawed with some of its dialog and plotting, as well as some key performances. But it's Clint Eastwood directing and Clint Eastwood the star acting in a near perfect two-dimensional performance (it works best as that, anything too much explained actually defeats the strengths of Kowalski for the audience), which makes it a minor must-see.",

In his youth, death was a trademark. Now in the twilight years, he seems to have brought out the humanitarian in him. In this film called "" Grand Torino "" Eastwood plays a retired auto worker, content to live out his life as a ill tempered curmudgeon, misunderstood by neighbors and family. His sole wish in life is to be left alone with his dog. Unfortunately, his neighborhood is infested with Asian foreigners, some of which live alongside him. As he nears the end of his life, he observes the youth gangs in his neighborhood have little manners and thus constantly invade his peace. That is until one boy is caught trying to steal his one remaining possession, a Grand Ford Torino. Dodging the gangs is difficult and Eastwood's character reluctantly accepts the boy as a pupil and tried to inject his life's philosophy into the troubled youth. As a result, the elders of the boy reciprocate with kindness. This allows Eastwood to galvanize the neighborhood into a merging caring collective which produces an unexpected result. A remarkable film and one which supposedly is Eastwood's last. An excellent tribute for a single lifetime as Eastwood Produced and directed it. Recommend ****",

It's been stated over and over about how clichéd this movie is, and that's probably its strongest point. It's downhill after that. The acting-- Clint's in particular-- is dreadful. I applaud the use of Hmong character's, but they should also be able to perform. Nope. The worst part of this film, for me, is that it is supposed to be ""courageous""-- so white-boy Clint spews as many slurs as he can, scattergunning epithets for every ethnic group he can come up with-- but dare not whisper the ""N"" word--even in a potentially ""appropriate"" scene-- which makes him totally unbelievable. If he was at all true to his character it would have popped out of his mouth smoother than ""zipperhead"", as living in Detroit would've afforded ample opportunity to hone that facet of his racism.

His most recent performances, starting with Unforgiven, along with Million Dollar Baby gave audiences a feeling of over-seasoning with old-age. As the audiences becoming old, they also got more and more involved in the characters played by Eastwood. In Gran Torino he perfects this tone of performance and delivered an Oscar-worthy performance. Just the last 20 minutes are worthy the Academy Award, in my opinion.",

The number of gross inconsistencies in character development, and highly improbable scenes are enough to make one wonder why time and money were spent making this film. Clint Eastwood's performance was a reprise of his earliest western films in which the tough guy staggers through the inane script. The appearance of weapons in unlikely situations can not be explained, and were obviously used to show how tough the main character was supposed to be. Apparently, his death at the end of the film was a vague metaphor for an even more illusory cleansing, but who knows what was meant? The entire film was so improbable that it seemed interminable.

And yet, ""Gran Torino"" is just that for the most part. The first two thirds of the movie are actually laugh out loud funny. Eastwood's Walt Kowalski runs his mouth with so many politically incorrect statements, it's a delight.

It was paced well and had a nice mix of humour, drama, action, emotion, cultural exploration, cultural understanding, redemption, forgiveness, finding manhood, modern issues, relationship building and human interaction.

Period.,"I'm no expert on movies by any means, but when a movie can make me experience every possible emotion, then leave me with tears running down my face and chills running through my body, it's quite apparent that this is a special movie. I first saw Gran Torino in 2009, during a dark time in my life, and since then I'd somehow forgotten the plot almost entirely, but I did not forget the emotional impact this movie had on me. I remember thinking it would be a typical high budget Hollywood action movie, with a lame story line but good action. However, what I got was the opposite of that, and I was very taken aback by how the movie played out, and every scene went against my predictions. Here we are 10 years later, and I am deeply moved once again by this movie. What surprises me the most, is that minus the high cost of an icon like Clint Eastwood, this movie could of been made with a budget of next to nothing.... which is extremely respectable. Clint used less resources than a C list movie, and somehow created a timeless masterpiece. I won't go into any details of this movie because I don't want to include any spoilers so that someone who's never seen this movie before can read this review, and hopefully have a great experience as I had.

In the past 5 years he has directed great films such as Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, Flags of our Fathers, Letters From Iwo Jima, Changeling, and Gran Torino. So many great movies in such a short period of time. Eastwood seems to be like a great wine, he gets better and better as time goes by. I really enjoyed this film. In Gran Torino, Eastwood plays an old grumpy and racist Korean War Veteran who befriends his Hmong neighbors and protects them from a gang. It is this unlikely friendship between them that makes this film work. And you cant leave out all the crazy dialog and racist comments which are what gives this film the comedic effect. Eastwood is probably the only person who can get away with this as he leaves all the political correctness out of place and truly becomes this grumpy old character. I really enjoyed every minute of this movie, it is Eastwoods second film of the year and both films are definitely on the top ten list.

I think that many of Eastwood's films are too sophisticated for the reviewers. There, I said it. I've seen this in Pale Rider, and many of his films. I think we all need to grow up a little when seeing an Eastwood film. In so doing, I think we wake up a little bit, and learn something from them.

Eastwood himself was fine but nothing special as an old angry curmudgeon (it's really not much of a stretch is it?). The problem I have with his films is that they lack any logical conclusion based in reality (particularly true of Million Dollar Baby). Same thing is true here. In the end of course Eastwood sacrifices himself for his new friends. It's completely illogical and is only used as a method for the audience to feel some sympathy for this ""hero"" who lets himself get killed to save his friends. Was this the only real solution besides using violence and killing a bunch of people? Yes, the point is that he suffered for the violence he committed years earlier (that point was not lost on me) but it felt heavy-handed and manipulative for Eastwood to have to die in the end.",

People WHO love to bust other people verbally. Not very politically correct place to live. I got my turn to be verbally busted and people love to see how you can take it and what your worth is. In the end, Walt viewed people by their actions and respect was earned. I think Walt learned a few things about other people in Grand Torino. In the end the right person earned the Gran Torino.

He didn't want to steal the car but he has to work to pay off the debt and Walt teaches him how to be a man and Thao also teaches Walt how to coexist. Walt gets mixed up in gang warfare and has to make difficult decisions along the way. Clint Eastwood's racism and devotion towards his Asian neighbors makes this movie mix well. The story itself was greatly written but there were no surprises or unexpected turns. The story was very basic but it worked. If something happened terrible happened to a character, which it does, you feel sorry and mad even. People care about these characters and by the end you see how each and every single character developed and changed. Not all movies have that affect and this movie did it differently.

Eastwood (who also directed) was perfectly cast as Walt Kowalski, an aging Korean War veteran whose wife has just died as the movie opens, whose family wants little to do with him except to get their hands on his house and his prized 1972 Gran Torino, and who is tormented by the fact that his neighbourhood has been taken over by Asians. Kowalski's racist nature was actually comical (in an Archie Bunker sort of way) but the most impressive thing about Eastwood's performance was how well he portrayed Kowalski's gradual change of heart toward his neighbours, beginning with his unexpected friendship with young Sue (a great performance by Ahney Her) and developing into his role as the neighbourhood's protector against the violent Asian gangs that continually invade the area. In that sense, Eastwood began to resemble an elderly Dirty Harry, with ""get off my lawn"" becoming Kowalski's version of ""make my day."" As Kowalski growls his way through his various encounters, first with his neighbours and then with the gangs, you are both appalled and amused by the character. You root for him in his battles with the gang, and finally end up applauding his ingenious and selfless way of getting the bums off the street and protecting his Asian neighbours who, as the last scenes of the movie demonstrate, have become far more his family than his real family had ever been. This is funny, action-packed, emotional at times (especially after Sue is attacked) and, in a strange sort of way for a very violent movie, even uplifting at the end. It's truly a superb piece of work by Eastwood.",

162,4 January 2009,screenwriter-14,10," ""The lessons of life and death""","GRAN TORINO is another masterpiece from Clint Eastwood and is a story that resonates with the diverse cultures of America today and the issues of assimilation into a white America. Eastwood portrays a typical blue collar American in the Midwest, hesitant to change, and dealing with his own personal issues. But when he takes on his neighbors and begins to understand their differences,along with their culture, magic happens on the screen and Eastwood's journey is one that brings laughter, as well as tears, to his growth and love for others. The Golden Globes missed out on this film, but Eastwood should be there at Oscar time and GRAN TORINO is a film that should be justly rewarded as the themes of life, death, family and assimilation of cultures into the American main stream, are extremely important ones. I can hardly wait until the Oscar nominations for GRAN TORINO.",

We're all different and are drawn to different things just like anybody else. In fact, I was born christian as were my parents. The movie portrays the modern hmong family only about 25% accurately and truthfully, backstage during filming there was racism going on even though the movie's main inclination is to KILL racism against the hmong people like seriously. What the heck? Clint Eastwood, you have lost my respect. Please stop trying to portray yourself as the great white hero we minorities need when in real life you wouldn't even genuinely converse or participate in activities with the hmong people except when you're ""on camera"". The lead hmong actor himself (whose name is Bee Vang for the 95% of you who didn't know or cared to know) said in an interview that Clint Eastwood kept his distance from the hmong people when they weren't filming.

I must say that I do not know why people love Eastwood's movies so much. I felt as if it was just not put together well. Maybe that is not the best way of putting it, but I would definitely say that he has no originality and does not bring anything new to the table as a director. To me it seems as cookie cutter as one can get with movies of this type. I felt as if the acting was terrible, but there were moments when I thought Eastwood was good, but not enough for me to think that he did a good job with the movie. I do not think that the script was all that strong to begin with and the dialog was a weak as it could get. I know the movie is about breaking views about stereo-types and prejudice and crap like that, but it did not resonate at all. I found myself laughing at a lot of racial slurs and I do not know if that was intentional, but it took away from the seriousness of the movie for me. Being a minority growing up with a lot of racists in my life might have skewed my view on this, but I do not think this was a realistic progression for any of the characters. This movie is as formulaic as it gets from the script to the music choices to the acting. Nothing unique about this movie to make me want to rate it any higher.",

They clearly have little in common with the old man and have little room in their lives for him. Back home Walt is alone with his dog feeling like a foreigner in his own neighbourhood; all the other European Americans have left and the Hmong who have moved in seem totally alien to him. Thao, the boy who lives next door is being pressured by his cousin to join his gang and as part of his initiation they want him to steal Walt's prized possession; his 1972 Ford Gran Torino. He tries but Walt chases him off. Later they try to force Thao to go with them; Walt might not like his Hmong neighbours but he won't sit by and watch especially when the confrontation spill onto his lawn. His actions make him a hero to the local community and when Thao comes round to make reparations for his actions the pair gradually bond. Walt also becomes friends with Thao's sister, Sue.

I actually had to turn away a few times because the situation became so very embarrassing. Sadly, Clint Eastwood is the only one on screen that keeps you from not walking away from it. Bee Wang and Ahney Her ,who are both totally unknown to me, both have major parts in this film. They are both doing among the worst acting jobs ever and should take acting classes before going on screen with one of the greatest.

Almost every single character in this movie was pushed to the extremes of stereotypes that it just didn't feel right. Walt was over angry, over lonely, over stubborn and you can probably put ""over"" in front of any describing adjective of that character. The opposite of Walt, the Chinese guy, was over ""the mentioned adjectives"" in exactly the opposite direction, and this is the theme that runs through the entire movie and all characters involved.

Clint Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski is a crotchety and ignorant old Korean War vet whose vocabulary is a thesaurus of racial slurs. He's basically a racist Dirty Harry in his 70s-80s and the script hits us over the head with his unabashed insensitivity and cold-heartedness to the point where ""Gran Torino"" is half comedy. But then, as only a masterful director such as Eastwood can do, ""Gran Torino"" becomes one of those classic unlikely relationship films between a widower and his teenage Asian-American neighbor. It's a film with a great premise but an off-kilter script that Eastwood salvages into something poetic.",

172,22 May 2022,emmanulstewart5,9, Good film of Eastwood,"Good film of Eastwood. Clint Eastwood serves as the pinnacle and emotional core that embraces the beauty of this film. Though there are a few flaws in terms of narrative, his brutally gripping portrayal of the lead character manages to lay those blemishes to obscurity. In the beginning of the film, we are introduced to his character who is gripped with tragedy and struggles with his faith with only his church preacher Father Janovich (played by Christopher Carley) being his aiding hand. Before too long, the character retains a grumpy, tough-minded, and prejudicial demeanor as he's grown hate to everyone of various racial status. One scene the young Korean teenager beaten and harassed by a gang who put him in a dog pile on Kowalski's yard, only to be interrupted by Kowalski himself who points a rifle at them and threatens to open fire if they don't leave his property. The scene is truly intense and sparks a fair amount of tension and unease. Furthermore, the character's near-constant use of racial slurs towards Asians and African-Americans and intimidating threats punctuate his cynical and hard-to-like nature. Clint Eastwood gives honestly one of his most arresting performances in recent years. He's an actor who doesn't take commitment for his role for granted. The almost equally powerful aspect of the film is the ironic relationships between the main character and the young Korean teenager who is brilliantly portrayed by Bee Vang. We watch as the bond between the two characters changes not only the troubled young man from turning to a life of crime by his cousin's tyrannical gang but also Kowalski's attitude towards the family and his determination to protect the family he once despised. The atmosphere is both dark and deeply moving, particularly the powerful and bittersweet ending.",

174,9 January 2010,rowmorg,1," Same old scowl, same old guns: no orang-utan","If you succeed in comprehending the dialogue in this movie, you will find that it contains no interesting or unpredictable lines, apart from the ugly racist sneers uttered by Clint Eastwood, whose voice --- never good --- is worse than ever. Ahney Her (as Sue) is no advertisement for Hmong elocution, since she s generally incomprehensible. She seemed to have developed some rare skill of gobbling her words: perhaps it's a Hmong thing. Apart from the lousy delivery, the film is remarkably uncertain about its handling of the key plot element: ethnic gangs. The most uncertain moment is when the gang pestering Sue's family has the astonishing experience of having one of its members beaten up by a very old man in its own gang house, and do they go to Clint's house for a showdown with him? No, they go to Sue's house! Well, that way, Clint lives to die another day.

175,4 August 2011,drqshadow-reviews,2, Eastwood Wears Prejudices on His Sleeve,"A surprisingly shallow way for Clint Eastwood's cinematic career to draw to a close, Gran Torino may have been better served with a more thick-witted title, something along the lines of ""Bitter Old Man Points Guns at Minorities."" Not that there isn't fertile ground for exploration along these lines; Eastwood's isolated, closed-minded widower could have been an excellent vehicle for prodding a number of inherent stereotypes present in modern American suburbia. Instead of meeting those issues head-on, though, it spends most of its time walking up and down the sidelines and, often, reinforcing the kind of bull-headed resistance to different cultures that, at the outset, it seemed ready to confront. I had a hard time accepting any of this film's main players as anything more than thin caricatures, especially considering the bland, straightforward dialog they're given to work with, and that resulted in a major emotional disconnect during the climax. Eastwood's jaded war veteran never seems to move completely beyond his biases and, shamefully, the film's resolution only serves to prove him right. A plodding, incomplete picture that will only be remembered for the single quotable line heard in its trailer.",

He's also a Korean War veteran who's very free with his politically incorrect views, and doesn't particularly care for the Hmong immigrants that have moved into his neighbourhood. All the same, he finds himself driven to look out for the troubled teenager (Bee Vang as Thao) who lives next door.

It is, however, about a racist living in a neighborhood that has changed. Walt Kowalski who was once surrounded by Polish neighbors is now living among Laotian, Aftrican-American, and Hispanic neighbors.

It would be less than a great shame to verging on the catastrophic should Eastwood not make another film in either (actor/director) capacity but if it has to be he need not feel even the tiniest shred of shame in a swansong of this calibre.

Rarely has Mr. Eastwood been more effective and entertaining, and for a career as successful as his, that's saying a mouthful. The movie itself is good, although there are some glitches in the plot and some overly contrived dialog. But the basic story is solid, with themes relating to social change, ethnic tensions, gang violence, aging, family tensions, and immigrants. Most interesting is the portrayal of members of the Hmong community who at first seem utterly out of place in its American setting but soon becomes apparent that they too share American values, both positive and negative. The movie also does an effective job of dramatizing ethnic tensions between minority groups. The main star, however, is Mr. Eastwood and his character Walt Kowalski around whom the story revolves. This movie is certainly worth watching and provides good entertainment.",
187,22 March 2009,Seamus2829,10, To Sleep (and live) With Anger,"Despite the fact that Clint Eastwood announced some time back that he is considering retiring after filming his latest opus (Gran Torino), he is,in fact working on his next project. Until then,we can sit back and enjoy 'Gran Torino'. Eastwood pulls no punches in his portrayal of Walk Kowalski,a decorated war veteran (Korea,in this case),who is in his later years,and longs for the way things were,back in the day. Walt is a walking case of anger,bitterness & repressed remorse for what he did fifty plus years ago in Korea. Things aren't any better, when his beloved wife has passed away, and his two sons want to put him in a retirement home. All Walt wants to do is sit on his porch with his dog,drink beer & smoke. Things only get complicated with the fact that he's the last white person on his block (which is boasting of a growing South East Asian community). The icing on the cake for Walt is the growing number of street gangs causing trouble for his Hmong neighbors (whom he already has major issues with). When he defends his neighbors from the street gang, a troubled sort of relationship starts to form between the two. Clint Eastwood directs himself (from a crisply written screenplay by Nick Schenk & Dave Johansson) as well as a top notch cast in a film that incorporates drams,pathos,humour & action. Eastwood himself deserves major kudos as a embittered war vet who's glory days are far behind him (and has no problem with expressing it). Rated 'R' by the MPAA, this film contains vulgar language (including some unpleasant racial slurs),as well as some violence (including the upsetting after effects of a rape & beating). Not a good choice for the kiddies.",

GRAN TORINO takes on this ugly issue and works it with such compelling force that just when the audience feels is cannot tolerate any more racial slurs a transformation takes place, opening a window to understanding and perhaps altering the poison of racism's effects on American Family While at first it may look to be another episode of Dirty Harry or ""What would a retired Dirty Harry do?"", this is a much complex movie. Yes the character depicted here by Clint Eastwood, has some similarities with his ""Dirty Harry"" character, but in the end, he's very different from him (you will get what I mean, if you watch the movie).I wouldn't call this a masterpiece yet it is a great movie, a little slow paced but entertaining enough. Eastwood here suffers from the abandon of his family and the death of his wife. For an old man, it could mean a depression and neurosis but he's capable of teaching a young boy what life is about. He also demonstrates he's a kind man and with an exquisite sense of humor. The movie is about Eastwood learning tolerance and befriended with Hmong neighbors. He befriends the young girl there, Sue and her brother, Thao. Thao has a cousin in a gang that keeps trying to get him to join and Walt becomes involved. The racist jokes and commentaries suit the movie's tone. Those dialogs are filled with black humor and tongue in cheek humor. Although Bee Vang delivers a great, emotional performance as Thao ""Toad"" Vang Lor, he is eclipsed by Eastwood's performance as Walt Kowalski.

Circumstances bring the young boy of this family to trying to steal, on the order from a gang of young people of this community, the Gran Torino collectible car of our Kowalski. Of course he is interrupted and yet spared a bullet that would have killed him. Why? Because Kowalski had done that, had killed a young boy, one day in Korea and that crime is still haunting him. Circumstances will lead him to helping that boy and his sister out of difficult situations with that gang but also with some blacks. He does that on the spur of the moment and along the line of his long cultivated guilt that has to find a salvation after the death of his wife and the discovery that he is spitting blood and probably has lung cancer since he is a heavy smoker. The gang though does not take an intimidation for an answer and certainly not for a final and uncrossable warning. So they go further in their victimizing that boy and girl from next door, a lot farther, and Kowalski take the case in his own hands, at night when he is sure the whole nest of killing predators will be assembled and he comes out of the night, on their front lawn, with dozens of witnesses all around to provoke them into killing him, in fact over-killing him and thus freeing him from his guilt and his disease and at the same time bringing the whole gang down for quite a long time. The best part of this film is the giving away of his possession before and after his death. He dares give his silver star to the young Hmong boy Tao before dying, and will his home to the church of the young Irish priest that had forced him into a sacrificial and Christian attitude and his Gran Torino to Tao again. Clint Eastwood in his old age seems to be cleaning up his own house and home, I mean his American mind and soul and that great Spring clearance takes the form of an admirable and at times compassionate or pathetic sidewalk confession and garage expiation. And that is so reassuring about the transformation that is taking place in the USA right now under our eyes, watered that it has been and still is by the blood of millions more victims, US or not, of two more wars in two more foreign countries that had asked nothing.",

Like Dirty Harry and Bill Munny before him, Kowalski (Eastwood) is an individualist who answers to no one and whose racism and anti-social behavior is the way he deals with frustration, in this case, minorities and Asian immigrants in the community. When local gangs threaten Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang), the young son of a large family of Hmong immigrants from Southeast Asia, however, Kowalski's cranky individualism is challenged in a way that compels him to reach out and transcend his misanthropic veneer.",

Clint plays Walt Kawolski, a grizzled Korean War veteran, who's too bitter to be accepting change. He resents the new neighbors on his block. A group of Hmongs move next door and he's full of contempt for those people. He's a widower, and he's also dying of cancer. On his birthday, he throws out his kids when they give him a chance for independent living. He later on slowly, changes his view when a young Hmong named Thao(Bee Vang), tried to be part of a local gang. His initiation, steal Walt's Gran Torino. His sister gets rescued by Walt when some black thugs start hassling her around. She later gives Walt a birthday dinner he'll never forget. When he sees Thao being a zero on getting the ladies, Walt gives his a crash course he'll never forget. Though he doesn't see himself as a hero to the Hmong, he ends up being one. Giving the chance to earn Walt's trust, he lends him the car when he gets the lovely girl. Now that's trust! Both men get vengeful when the Hmong gang attacks Thao's family, and brutally attack his sister, Walt was furious! He beats up one member when Thao gets his face burned. Walt ended up a hero when he confronted the gang. At least he got peace, the painful way. Well, maybe. It was funny where he was explicit with his will. He only wanted Thao to have the Gran Torino. Simply, he doesn't trust the granddaughter. Yes, he may have been hardcore, but he was old-school as well. Sue(Ahney Her) looked up to him a lot. Though he may not agree with her actions, he kinda did, just wouldn't show it. Some things would make any man bitter, it takes time to give it a chance. Most people let the past go to their brains. Walt didn't. He did get a chance to be a father figure again, to some who's not from his family. Clint Eastwood always know how to make a hit. He did point to some of my favorites, Ford Motor Vehicles. That what really got me going. Also diversity, that what makes the world go round. Learn the ropes, from a veteran is always going to be better than learn things from a rookie. This movie is a gemstone. ""GET OFF MY LAWN!"" is the new classic here! 5 stars!",

215,21 January 2009,meeza,10, The Pitches of Eastwood are still striking magic!,"It is deluxe, it is old, it is powerful, it swaggers, it still runs well, it can direct you smoothly, it is priceless, and it is infamous. I could be easily referring to the classic Gran Torino automobile; however, I am primarily talking about the monumental Hollywood God: Clint Eastwood. He continues to flabbergast all of us movie buffs by still maintaining his film-making supremacy even at the twilight of his illustrious career. I do not know what drives Clint; but I do know that he has driven his latest film ""Gran Torino"" to a superb flick destination. Eastwood directed ""Gran Torino"" and stars as Walt Kowalski, a retired Detroit autoworker who grimaces and prejudices his way through life. He is a recent widow who has two estranged sons; and he is not shy to share racist comments with others about the Hmongs whom he feels have wrongfully inhabited the neighborhood he has resided in for decades. Walt has trouble getting along with others including his two sons and his grandkids. Let's just say that Walt Kowalski is at the opposite end of the spectrum of Walt Disney. Walt's precious possession is a 1972 Gran Torino that he keeps stored in his garage in mint condition. When Walt's young Hmong neighbor Thao is forced to steal the Gran Torino by a group of hoodlums is when ""Gran Torino"" stars gearing up its thought-provoking plot. Thao's family is almost attacked by the same hoodlums but Walt comes to the rescue and to quote Dirty Harry himself ""makes their day"". Walt all of a sudden becomes ""the good, the not-so-bad, and the pretty"" geriatric boy of the neighborhood and is suddenly worshiped as a hero in the Hmong neighborhood. The Hmongs bring Walt gifts in appreciation, but Walt wants to be left alone in his ""grumpy old man"" life. However, some type of ""changeling"" gradually embodies Walt and he stars befriending his Hmong neighbors; most notably the witty female teenager Sue and her younger brother no other than Thao himself. Thao is forced to work for Walt by his family in order to repay his debt to ""Walt Society"" for trying to steal le Torino. Walt and Thao's elevator relationship is the heartstring and spark plug of ""Gran Torino"" and provides the sincere life lessons of the film; but not in an afterschool special kind of way. Writer Nick Schenk's touching screenplay is one of the best of the year; you have to ""schenk"" it out. I am glad than Schenk took a ""grassroots"" approach to writing by including the film's catchphrase ""Get of my lawn"". Let's head back east now! Because ""Gran Torino"" is Eastwood's showcase! He has never acted better in his classic career! He was mesmerizing as Walt and his ""Gran Torino"" thespian performance is headed for a red carpet light at The Oscars. Within Clint's direction of the film, he properly drives ""Gran Torino"" into reverberating societal & humanistic issues as: racism, mortality, religion, kinship, culture, friendship, and even more. In other words, his ""Gran Torino"" is fully loaded! Therefore, test drive the ""Gran Torino"" today! It will be worth your cinematic ride! ***** Excellent",
216,13 July 2018,user-322-326156,4, One of the worst C. Eastwood movies I've seen. Ridiculous dialog & poor acting.,"I saw this film when it came out and I thought it was garbage. 10 years later (today), I gave it another shot. I found it just as cringy embarrassing as I did when I saw it the first time. I don't know who did the casting, but almost everyone is miscast. Look at those asian actors today. They are nobodys - poof; gone! Yet somehow they were supposed to be one of the main anchors of this film. And whoever wrote the script; terrible. The lines the actors have to say sound like a 9th grade A/V student wrote them. They are embarrassing & awkward. Lots of times after they say something I'd say to myself ""What? Who says that?"". And even though I love Mr. Eastwood - he went too over the top by trying to play the hardass old man with his overdone scowl on his face and gruff voice. I still didn't get the entire pulling his finger out of his pocket like a gun routine. And I totally forgot how the film ended but when I saw it again today I was just SMH. This is one of his most terrible films in my opinion. How anybody can rally behind this lame flick is beyond me - but to each his own I guess, right?",
217,28 March 2020,yusufpiskin,8," It's Eastwood's requiem, and it's fantastic.","Clint Eastwood in this film reminds me of my grandpa Hasan, though not entirely, some of the decisions made are precisely decisions I could see my grandpa making if he were alone and surrounded by a neighbor changing from what he knew it to me as he grows older. I had a connection with Walt (Clint Eastwood) for that very reason. From a character development standpoint it was perfect, he started out a grade  to everyone and everything, souly based on his past experiences. By the end of the film, he grew to care for this neighborhood kid and made it his dying goal to keep this kid from living the rest of his life in regret and misery.

219,16 July 2009,tallvike,1, Get Off My Yawn,"Dumb, dumb, DUMB! I WANT to like Clint Eastwood, I really do. He is one of the few remaining true film stars and seems like a nice enough guy. The premise of this story was promising: a bigoted, crusty old Korean War vet with a chip on his shoulder forms an unlikely friendship with his Hmong neighbors. It COULD have been a great movie, and it started out well enough. But the acting was SO overdone, the script was SO cliché, and the characters were WAY too caricaturized, that the story soon lost all credibility. I was hoping that the film would portray a lesson about not giving up on people, even when they put up walls to keep people away. But Walt Kowalski was just plain mean. I found nothing likable about him. Part way through the movie, I thought, ""Maybe this is supposed to be a comedy?"" But if it is, I just don't think racial jokes and put-downs are funny. Sorry, Mr. Eastwood. This movie was a stinker.",
220,12 March 2009,Robert_duder,10, An absolute masterpiece---Eastwood gives a masterful piece of film making,"Rumor has this being Clint Eastwood's last acting performance (please Mr. Eastwood don't do it!!) But if he did decide to retire from acting Gran Torino would have been the most brilliant and effective swan song he could have thought of. The man stars, directs, and sings in the film but that alone doesn't make it brilliant. The sheer power of the film is what makes it incredible. Gran Torino is this intense and amazing character study led by the absolutely mind blowing character of Walt Kowalski created, played by, embodied by Mr. Eastwood. The character is probably the most unlikable, growly, peculiar, twisted of Eastwood's characters and yet he comes full circle and has such a huge character arc and goes through so many changes. The real brilliance is that you know Kowalski has a history, and so much has happened to him that has grated on him and made him very bitter about the world around him. It isn't really about the races around him, or his rude demeanor towards youth, and different cultures but just about the things that have happened to him in his past. While you never really discover details you know the history is there drawing you into the story and this man's life.",
221,4 January 2010,pepekwa,6, not realistic,"All Clint Eastwood directed movies are watchable as there's always a poignant story to tell that ambles along in its own time, this movie is no exception. However, unlike his earlier work, I found it very unrealistic that Walt would effectively give up his life for Thao. In the space of a few scenes, we're meant to believe that this crusty, inflexible, set in his ways, racist etc old man who has hated Asians and their ilk for generations now would fall over for them, I don't buy it even if he hates his family and is dying himself. Men like that always go to their grave bitter and angry. But as Clint was acting in his own movie, he can do what he wants I guess. Similarily, when confronting gang bangers in earlier scenes, again why would they just stand aside and let him do whatever he wants, maybe Clint was yearning to be ""harry"" one last time, very noble but sadly unrealistic and that detracts from the movie for me. Otherwise, its a decent story about modern America although, at times it seemed like a documentary about the Hmong people with sue explaining their culture, why they are in the US etc! Clint Eastwood is an amazing actor and director but I think his ego got in the way of this film.",

223,3 January 2009,fertilecelluloid,9, Eastwood furthers his legend,"Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"" arrives in cinemas just two months after ""Changeling"" and it's another winner. Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a widowed, grumpy, bigoted, no-nonsense war vet who takes a young Asian boy (Bee Vang) under his wing after he catches him trying to steal his Gran Torino, a car the Ford Motor Company cranked out in the 70's. Vang has been targeted by a gang of thugs who want him to join their directionless cause; Walt sees some potential in the boy, so determines to cultivate it. A short summary can't do justice to the complexities the film addresses. Eastwood's Walt is one of the screen's great characters, a flawed Everyman who's been left high and dry by his wife's death and the changing social environment around him. The character spouts a torrent of racial slurs and seem steadfast in his refusal to accept another culture and its inherent rituals. The first half of the film mixes violence and bitter comedy as Walt clashes with the thugs and gradually warms to the ways of his Asian neighbors. The film's second half explores Walt's rebirth as he schools his charge in the basics of responsibility and the finer points of social intercourse (a couple of hilarious sequences here). He also clashes with a well-meaning priest who promised Walt's late wife that he'd extract a confession from the atheistic old bastard. Eastwood works his magic to deliver a very compelling, totally involving drama that ends on a solemn, powerful note. This considerable accomplishment furthers his legend.",

I left the theater very disappointed; the movie, as many others have said, is boring, predictable and the racism theme is trite. It isn't a terrible movie but some scenes are really dumb like the one in the barber shop where he tries to teach Tao how to be a man. Also, Clint making fun of foreign names...well, only a 8 year old could laugh at it. The movie is not an action movie, just a mix of comedy and drama.

As is often the case, I am confounded by popular opinion, and am left scratching my aching head as to how this film could be revered by so many. While I could see the humor in it, and can admit that it worked sporadically as a crowd pleaser, I do not profess that Eastwood's created an important piece of sociological insight. In fact, my opinion is that the film's perspective not only is unimportant, but also irresponsible and indelicate. Aside from the atrocious acting (not sure if this is due to the talent level of the actors or if it was the intended direction of the film), the characters are nothing but caricatures drawn from the perspective of a racist cartoonist. They are not redeemed or empowered by a script that is only interested in dying for the sins of its white protagonist. The religiosity of the film's final act is the biggest eye roller of them all, with Eastwood's character being likened to Jesus himself, so that the film can pretend it cares about the well being of its supporting cast.

I'm sure everyone was expecting Eastwood to relive the old West as Dirty Harry and kill everyone of them with a single hand gun, but that's not what happened at all! I was both surprised and kind of disappointed, but thinking about it more I liked the way it ended. The gang members would never have expected an unarmed old man! He was clearly dying anyway, so going out like he did had to be something he wanted. This movie is a must see. 10 stars!",

The acting is embarrassing to watch, who cast these actors? The screenplay is basically a poorly written two hour long racist joke. I don't care who lives or dies and frankly the world would be better off with all the characters dead. If you like Clint Eastwood films, which I do, you will be completely ashamed. Maybe this film was so terrible to me because I had seen ""The Wrestler"" only hours earlier. I say that, but the truth is it's just bad. Avoid at all costs!!! You will thank me in the long run. If you want a movie that is a real slice of life, finely acted, and contains someone you can care and relate to I recommend ""The Wrestler"" instead.",

252,23 January 2009,sumsaris,5, A Masterpiece of Embarrassment,"The film Gran Torino culminates a feeling that has been growing within me for roughly the past decade or so. A last straw of sorts. Although this view goes against the prevailing tide, I believe Clint Eastwood has officially become the most over-rated director working in Hollywood today. Every one of the films he's made since Unforgiven, except perhaps Mystic River, has played with the melodramatic 'umph' of a bowl of chicken noodle soup. Hold the salt. If Mystic River stands out of the crowd, it is in large part due to the stellar performances of the three protagonists. I wonder if Eastwood has become Hollywood's darling simply on the basis of his being such a true Mr. Nice Guy. Or is it that the themes he chooses to deal with are generally so noble. Yet, film after film we are treated to the same directorial auto-pilot mode, unimaginative camera angles, rhythm-less editing and dialogue worthy of a Spiderman episode. Every now and then he is saved by his director of photography (Iwo Jima, Changeling), but in general we remain forever in the Land of the Bland. Nothing particularly bad about his work, but nothing really remarkable either. Until Gran Torino.",

It's a drama that at it's core is simply about an individual grumpy man's version of 'family' evolving and changing.

If you've seen this movie and enjoyed it, the only way I can offer a bit of enlightenment is to encourage you to listen to any real-life conversation that is taking place between any two people at any time anywhere in the world, and then compare it to the dialogue in Gran Torino. I think you will find in hindsight that word choice, the pacing, and the delivery come off as stilted, over-played, and clichéd in a manner which would make ""Crash"" blush. As seems to be true of contemporary society, this script is out of touch with its characters' voices and makes up for this absence of authenticity by exaggerating obvious stereotypes, such as the brooding vet, the snarky girl, etc. Clint would do well to relax a bit and let the voices of these characters evolve a bit more, rather than relying on these rather easy character devices.",

265,27 July 2009,jboothmillard,6, Gran Torino,"Star and director Clint Eastwood was rumoured as retiring from acting after this film, if that is the case he has made a good final performance. Basically grumpy, tough-minded, widowed automobile assembly worker and Korean war veteran Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) wants nothing to do with anyone, not his kids, Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) or even his new Asian neighbours, no-one. The only possession he really cares about is his mint condition 1972 Ford Gran Torino, and his new neighbour, teenage Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang) tries to steal it. Thao's family are disappointed in him, and they insist that Walt lets him work for him, fixing things for a week as punishment, and doing this Walt does show some humanity. Thao is getting beaten badly by a gang run by his own cousin, and soon enough it gets to the point where all his family get involved in the attacks. Walt sees no other choice but to protect Thao and his family from the dangerous gang attacks, and the final scene is a very brave move for him to make, also being the last. Also starring Ahney Her as Sue Lor, Brian Haley as Mitch Kowalski, Geraldine Hughes as Karen Kowalski, Brian Howe as Steve Kowalski, Dreama Walker as Ashley Kowalski, William Hill as Tim Kennedy, John Carroll Lynch as Barber Martin, Brooke Chia Thao as Vu and Chee Thao as Grandma and Scott Eastwood, Clint's son as Trey. Clint is fantastic in both the serious scenes, towards the end especially, and with his humorous grumpiness with one-liner put downs for everyone. It takes a little while to get to the really interesting stuff with the gangs and danger, but Clint keeps you engaged both on screen and behind the camera in a most watchable drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for Jamie Cullum's title song, with music by Clint's son Kyle.

The acting is abysmal and even though Eastwood is usually great or at the very least watchable, his crucial acting choice concerning the tortured nature of his character was to speak for the entire movie through his teeth. I'm pretty sure he didn't unclench his teeth even once. Moreover, the script was just disgusting and the dialogue was stiff and stilted. Finally, the ultimate message of the movie seemed to be that this immigrant community was only able to save itself because the white man was willing to die for them. HE ACTUALLY DIES WITH HIS ARMS SPREAD OUT IN THE SHAPE OF A CROSS. YES, YES, AS IN Jesus. Christ, THAT IS. Let's not even get into the fact that Clint Eastwood's character never actually stops being racist and so his redemption is contained in this totally contrived death, despite the fact that he, as a person, never really undergoes any substantial or worthwhile change.",

Walt had no intention of helping his Hmong neighbors, he was just trying to get them off his lawn. He ends up finding a kinship with his neighbors and a bond between them grows. While bonding with Thao and teaching him to become a man, he learns about the Hmong culture and ends up giving up his racist ways. The film the takes a dark turn as is expected when dealing with gangs. This is very well put together overall with a lot of wit and humor with one of Clint's most powerful performances in front of the screen. As one of Clint's biggest fans, I sincerely hope that he is not done acting yet. I didn't think I would like Trouble With The Curve, but Clint is great in that too.

Recently widowed, Walt is old-school: He hates his children for driving Japanese trucks and for trying to put him into an assisted-living facility and his grandchildren for their insolence and impropriety. Compounding Walt's loneliness is that he has become a stranger in his hometown; his neighbors all have died or moved away, and a cadre of ""dog-eating"" Hmong immigrants has taken their place, whom he incessantly disparages.

It comes in small increments and the charm is not in what happens eventually, but what happens in each small doses. His slow developing relationship with the Hmong family next door. Because he steps in in a crisis situation, their culture sees him as a hero and sets out to reward him. They bring him endless presents and food. Because he leads such a lonely existence, he is slowly, but surely, pulled in. He keeps a balance of hatred for the punks he sees with a true love for those who have befriended him.l",

He never goes for the obvious; there the ending is a remarkable example.

So, given you know what you're gonna get -- you won't be disappointed with Gran Torino. At least when it comes to Clint. If he had cast experienced competent actors in the other lead roles -- specifically Thao and Sue -- Gran Torino would likely be a riveting, entertaining and award-winning film. But, alas, the amateur performances of the Hmong cast sink the film to, at times, high school production levels. I assume Mr. Eastwood chose authenticity over professionalism. Big mistake.

284,14 January 2009,inkblot11,8," Gran Torino is a fine vehicle, wonderfully touching and real, but, tears may fall for many viewers","Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a retired automobile lineman, living in or around Detroit. He has just lost his wife and his relationship with his two sons and their families is somewhat strained as well. Therefore, he is mostly a solitary creature, taking superb care of his house and lawn and spending most of his days alone with his dog, Daisy. The neighborhood around his home is in decay, because those with the means to maintain their homes are moving out and the poorer folks are moving in. In fact, the house next to Walt's holds three generations of Hmong immigrants, much to Walt's disgust. That's because he is, first, somewhat of a bigot and, second, because he has haunting memories of the time he spent in the Korean War, killing the ""enemy"". One day, two of the Hmong neighbors, daughter Sue (Ahney Her) and son Thao (Bee Vang) are harassed by a gang of other Hmong low-lifes. It is Walt who comes to their rescue, telling the riffraffs to get off the block. Suddenly, he is a hero to the Hmong and, reluctantly, Walt strikes up a friendship with Sue and Thao, much to his surprise. But, even though Walt helps the sensitive Thao learn how repair things and start a job in the construction industry, the gang members refuse to leave him and his lovely sister, Sue, alone. What will it take to bring an end to their threats and actions? At 78, Eastwood has nothing more to prove, yet he has produced another stunning winner. Although it is not quite as worthy as Mystic River (that is one of the greatest films of all time) or Million Dollar Baby, Clint has still created a beautifully complex movie that will fascinate and touch viewers everywhere. With his portrayal of a repugnant bigot, first glance, Eastwood is at his best, showing Walt, also, as a gritty and determined war veteran and hard-working American. His Kowalski, too, is quite comical in his incessant racially-charged put-downs and his guttural groans which harken back to Lurch on the Addams Family! Without a doubt, this is the terrific performance of a cinematic master. Also quite wonderful are Vang and Her as the targeted siblings, each giving heart-breaking yet comical turns as the sensitive people who can't escape the bullying of others. All other cast members, including Christopher Carley as a caring priest, are just marvelous, too. The setting in Detroit (or Hamtramck?) is also a wonder, making one sad for the loss of a great city in these times but making one admire the strength of those who have stayed. Costumes, cinematography, and other production values are great, also. As for the story and its direction, they will grab the viewer by the gut and never let go. In short, Gran Torino is a terrific film vehicle which never runs out of fuel. Every viewer will feel immensely rewarded as the closing credits roll.",

But as the movie went on, with Mr. Eastwood constantly making inhuman noises, launching non-funny - but ""all-american; I'm-a-RAW-son-of-a-b****, the world has hurt me, and left me to rot"" jokes, and ""mingleing"" with the horrible cast - I just wasn't entertained. I'm still getting goosebumps of humiliation on behalf of Bee Vang (The actor who plays Thao), in the scene where he is locked in Walt's cellar; once again, horrible, horrible. At the end, I was just really disappointed in the movie. It could have been a great accomplishment - but it didn't, at all, rip itself off the Hollywood wallpaper. We have seen this movie a thousand times before, and will most likely see a thousand more of them (perhaps a few this Summer already).",
293,19 August 2013,Board,4, Looked promising but alas!,"Like most others, I like Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director (at least from around the year 2000 onwards). ""Million dollar baby"" and ""Changeling"" were two quite lovely films to give just two examples of him as a director. ""Gran Torino"" definitely had its strong points, and I enjoyed the themes of misplaced racism, and how it sucks the joy out of life, the unsolvable problem with gangs, and the need to get your problems off your chest instead of keeping them inside. I also liked the pale colours of this film (just like in Changeling), which was perfect for this bleak environment. But the problem for me with this film was simply that it wasn't very credible.",

300,7 February 2009,Willie-12,7," Not Eastwood's Best, But Still Pretty Darn Good","Gran Torino is not Clint Eastwood's best movie. Not by a long shot. However, even when Eastwood is not quite on top of his game, the result is still pretty darn good. I didn't even mind the somewhat depressing ending, because...well, that's just Eastwood. No one tells a tragic tale better than him. And what occurs in this film is tragic. But there is a ray of hope found at the end of this story...the idea that sacrifice and honor will ultimately defeat suppression and hatred. Eastwood's Walt Kowalski is a crotchety old man, and an angry bigot. At times, it's even a little difficult to like the man. But, as the famous saying goes, ""you can't judge a book by it's cover."" And, in the end, when the time calls for Walt to make a decision that will ultimately bring about dire consequences for himself, but ensure the safety of others, he doesn't even think twice. This is vintage Eastwood. That's not to say that there weren't any problems with this film though. Actually there were quite a few. It did seem a bit long, and yet the running time was just a shade under two hours. Simply put, there were a few scenes that could have used some editing, or could have been cut out completely. An example would be when Walt takes young Thao to the barber shop. I know that this scene was supposed to help illustrate the friendship developing between Walt and Thao. However, I think the film had already established that fact by the time this scene rolled around, and thus it seemed a bit redundant and distracting. And I'm not surprised that this was the first acting experience for Ahney Her (Sue), and Bee Vang (Thao). While they did a passable job, it seemed like, at times, they were reading their lines from a cue card. Part of the wooden acting, however, may also have been the result of a screenplay that needed some work. But, even with all the weaknesses, this is still a pretty good film. I would even go so far as to say it's a must for Eastwood fans. And if, as some have suggested, this is his last film as far as acting is concerned, he goes out with a bang. Figuratively and literally.",

The story was not written for Eastwood but it certainly feels like it was. The director has always tried to explore the ageing process of American society with a dose of sarcasm and very genuinely. In ""Gran Torino"" as well the audience will see a mix (quite eccentric actually) of violence and humanity, everything in harmony with the setting and the ambiance of many other Clint's works.",

A large family of Vietnamese refugees has moved in next door,loud,chaotic and close - knit,a complete contrast to his distant sons and their cold - eyed acquisitive offspring. Korean war vet Kowalski sees them with a jaundiced eye and rebuffs their attempts to befriend him. Under pressure from a street gang their youngest son tries to steal Kowalski's car and is nearly shot for his trouble.Slowly and grudgingly in an almost Fordian way,Kowalski teaches the boy to become a man. Nobody but Ford,you might think,could get away with such sentiment,but Mr Eastwood proves yet again that he has inherited the master's mantle. Influenced also by his mentor Mr D.Seigel's ""The Shootist"",Mr Eastwood has his main character commit suicide by gangbanger,redeeming himself and saving the neighbourhood at the same time. Half a century of guilt over an incident during the Korean War has turned Kowalski into a miserable misanthrope with a bad word for everybody.Whilst hardly Mary Poppins at the death,he has gone to his grave ""justified"",much as Mr R.Scott and Mr J.McRea in ""Ride the high country"". His total and joyful lack of 21st century political correctness has offended many but actions speak louder than words and a brave and brutally honest man chooses to end his life in a way that will benefit his Asian neighbours.Not,I submit,the act of an unregenerate nazi. Those who thought ""Unforgiven"" was Mr Eastwood's swansong will have to think again as his theme changes from unremitting bleakness to a rather tentative glimpse of optimism about the human condition.",

Eastwood is fantastic as the disgruntled, bigoted, ex-Korean war veteran who has become recently widowed. Now his character not only has to deal with life alone, but life with an Oriental family next door. Being an ex-Korean vet, his dislike for the Asian culture is evident at the onset of the film. Gran Torino is a wonderful character study of a man who learns to deal with his prejudices of others, of a man who learns to respect another culture and a man who learns to become friends with someone who he would have never looked twice at in his earlier years. It shows how a man changes from someone who hates a person to someone who becomes a strong male influence on that same young person. It is a wonderful, heartfelt and at times humorous story about the relationship between these neighbors. Gran Torino is an excellent film that ""real"" moviegoers will enjoy.",

Clint produced a double magic act both performing an directing at 78 years of age now that i call somethin special. And also th end and the soundtrack astonishing; i really shared a tear when Thao and Daisy passes by in the Gran Torino and the song started; U can't dream of somethin greater this absolutely PERFECT.

Gran Torino is sad, dramatic, educational, and sometimes funny. Gran Torino is rather awesome. The Plot: Walt is a retired ex-soldier who doesn't like what's going on in his neighborhood. Tons of Koreans are moving in. There's also a lot of gang violence. Walt soon becomes friends with his next door neighbors Thao and Sue, and shows them whats wrong and teaches them about society. Gran Torino is an amazing film. It really does deserve it's spot on the top 250. Eastwood does a great job as Walt. The gang in the film really are a-holes. The film has a good ending and I was pleased. If this is Eastwood's last performance or film, he's going down in a blaze of glory. From films like Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, The good, the bad, and the ugly, and In the Line of Fire, Eastwood has had a fantastic acting career and directing career.

I was an instant admirer of his work. Since then, he's rarely let me down, and catching up on Dirty Harry, I saw what I was missing. However, that being said, he surely has gotten better with age, and with every movie. Take 'Million Dollar Baby,' a near masterpiece. 'Gran Torino' is definitely short of that, but still a wonderful, actually suspenseful at times and often hilarious film, with a fantastic performance by Eastwood, but unfortunately, unlike 'Baby,' everyone else seems wooden. This might be due to the fact 'Torino' was being made during breaks from his other film 'Changeling.' Either way, Eastwood stands out again and it was wonderful seeing someone completely un-PC (God, I'm sick of PC) even if it's just a fictional character. So anyone easily offended by language and bigotry (the latter I'm very much familiar with), you have fair warning this contains its full share. But, for those with open minds/hearts: 'Torino' is a definite must see even if it's not a completely original story about a gruff older gent that (no real spoiler here) changes his ways. I think they set out to make a small film, but I can see this little film lasting generations.",
311,31 July 2013,Phillip-Riback,10, Inimitable Legend,"Just by looking the story of the film it is quite clear that the viewer in evidencing the last acting appearance in the prolific career of a big macho icon, and considering that Clint Eastwood is one of the few actors and directors at the same time, generally an author who never make mistakes in his plan, this, his swan song is a praiseworthy move. Gran Torino makes a tribute to all Clint's characters in his career. The protagonist Walt Kowalski, who is a rigid and quiet individual - an aging veteran of the Korean War, represents actually a combination of several characters, such as Inspector Harry Callahan, retired journalist Robert Kincaid (from Bridges of Madison County), Frankie Dunn (from million Dollar Baby) etc. The story is simple but the fact that the main character is in his golden years really makes it big and ambiguous. Sentimentality, nostalgia, coping with the new times, the loss of loved ones, discord with close ones, the relationship with the children.., all these are motives that Clint dealt with in his previous movies, and although are not mentioned here, they can be felt. As a personal project Gran Torino is a masterpiece.",

By random he becomes the unlikely friend with neighbours Sue and Thao of the Hmong people. The rest is a dramedy, turned tragedy, turned revenge/redemption. Walt has lung cancer. We never hear the word, but it's pretty clear and at last stage. It's not important per se for the story, but says alot of his character. Selfmade, he don't tell anyone. I'll easy rate this as Clints finest performance since Million Dollar Baby. He actually kids around with his old macho image. The hmong kids both do a very good job, likable, just as you feel disgust for the gang tormenting them. Close your eyes two seconds, and you'll miss Clints son, Scott, in a very minor role.",

I do hate the fact that so many characters with guts are depicted as alcoholics in film, let's get beyond that.

326,7 March 2009,Jonny_Numb,8, Eastwood's Legacy,"At this point in his career, Clint Eastwood can afford to get a little experimentalhe's earned it. I mean, would you tell this mean-looking SOB otherwise? I thought not. And while ""Gran Torino"" treads territory that invites memories of such whitebread vigilante epics like ""Joe"" and ""Falling Down,"" Eastwood (who directed and stars) transforms his film into a character study that, in spite of all its by-the-numbers machinations, works on damn near every level. I have never been a big fan of the man's directorial outings, but the appropriateness of his slice-of-life detail really turned my head here. Our grizzled, aged, yet firm-featured star plays Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran whose cynical, bigoted outlook on the world is affirmed by his wife's passing, and outright exacerbated by the arrival of a Hmong family next door. When the young son is caught trying to steal the codger's 1972 Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation, Walt becomes a one-man force of nature who isn't beyond training a gun on the kids stepping on his fresh-cut lawn. Yet when he frightens off the bullying gang in a gesture of unintended heroism, he is heralded by his neighbors, eventually acquiescing to the pleas that Thao, the son, pay off his transgression with a week of servitude to Walt. That these two unlikely characters become friends goes without saying; it's in the generational and cultural gaps that Eastwood makes these conventions something of revelation: the film even presents a nagging spiritual quandary for Walt that intensifies his burden as we see the layers of ice thawing from his personality. Additionally, ""Gran Torino"" is filled with such spun-from-Americana Archie Bunkerisms that one can't help but laugh at the audacity of Kowalski's passive racism (even positing that his usage of such slurs might spring from his own insecurity and fear); it sounds ""wrong"" and ""un-PC"" to say such a thing, and perhaps it's only in the context of our familiarity with Eastwood the actor and his hoarse voice and deliberate mannerisms that humor connects in such surprising places. Eastwood is no longer the young man who set screens ablaze in the Westerns of Sergio Leone, or as Harry Callahan, and ""Gran Torino"" seamlessly consolidates decades of his tough-guy persona into a character who is at once Eastwood, and also a near-satirical comment on the character he has been most associated with for his entire career, providing a fitting tribute to his own career, and an appreciative gift to fans of great cinema.",

The film is about a lone white ex Korean military man who saves a Hmong immigrant family from a terrible Hmong gang and terrible African American hoods. The allusions to Christ are obvious but I won't elaborate so as not to spoil the ending for any readers still with me. The message embedded in this film, I believe, is that American militaristic male white-hood is there to save everyone else from themselves so you all can rest easy. Quite the task however it would appear Clint Eastwood believes America and Christ are up to it. The acting is not that great and seems forced. Eastwood playing a curmudgeon who swears a lot and believes that male bonding is all about exchanging insults with other men who insult him right back. There is a scene where he and his barber are trying to teach a Hmong teenager how to do this and naturally all is right with the world once said Hmong teenager has mastered the technique and thrown some zingers himself which immensely impress the two white men.

Not excluding the young priest, Father Dzhanovich, who reads a funeral sermon in a pathetic tone, arguing that death brings with it both the bitterness of loss and the joy of eternal peace of the soul. One can only guess with what indignation and sadness Walt observes how there is less and less ""American"" in America - and now there are only Asians in the neighbors, and his son's family drives around in a Japanese jeep. And yet Clint Eastwood did not suddenly warn in an interview that the film, in which he may have played the main role for the last time, is directed against the notorious ""political correctness"", but at the same time is deeply anti-racist. No matter how Kowalski mocked the attempts of an inexperienced pastor to lure a convinced cynic and atheist to confession, but the old man's conscience does not know peace. It is not difficult to guess for what ""exploits"" he received a ""Silver Star"" that for several decades he has not been able to forgive himself those young ""blockheads"" whose lives he ruined in a foreign land. It is possible that the blame for the sharply deteriorated relations with relatives partly lies with him - at least to the extent that the parent is assigned.

Bitter old man who has seen too much of life? Check. Formerly nice, middle-class neighborhood being overrun by generically ethnic hell-raising teenagers? Check. Hard-working and helpless women, children and old people who need some strong-arm style protection? Check. Creepy neighbor with lots of guns and a cool car? Nothing new there.

Clint Eastwood is a fine enough actor that a simple furrowing of the brow could have pulled this off. His grandson's rummaging through his old foot locker clearly establishes he was a Korean War veteran, but again this seems overdone. It was all ready been established his grandkids were disrespectful brats by the attire they wore to their grandmother's funeral. Why not a more subtle clue that he is a veteran?

Eastwood commands an authenticity and humanity. The screenplay by Nick Schenk from the story by Dave Johannson and Schenk is a stark tale of prejudice, and possibility in a world of no possibility.

It is no surprise that Walt is a little bit tetchy, and one can only think they have seen this character some where before.

His family were nothing but vultures who cared nothing for him, and were waiting until he died, so they can sell everything that he had (In particular, his prized 1972 Gran Torino), and essentially his life would become meaningless. Spoilers ahead: When he was willing to sacrifice himself (Thus making sure the gang what raped Sue, and terrorized the Community, would no longer be able to do it again), and even more importantly by donating his house to the Church (Which is what his wife wanted), he could receive salvation, and help others in need. Perhaps most important, by giving his Grano Torino (And although not stated, but heavily implied) his mint condition tool set, and thus a job to Thao (Bee Vang). When Walt is able to get Thao hired, one of the first questions asked is does he have his own tools? When you see the final scene with Thao and his girl friend in the car, you can see how much he appreciates the gifts Walt gave him (Based on the condition of the car and his improved attitude). In effect, Walt will not be forgotten about, and although he failed with his own family, he succeeded in accomplishing something good with Thao and his family, and through him, he will not be forgotten about. 10/10 Stars.",
389,23 December 2008,zetes,7," A mess of a film, with a lot of bad parts and a lot of good parts","A confused and sometimes infuriating film, but also one that is undoubtedly entertaining and occasionally even touching. Eastwood stars as a grizzled Korean War veteran and widower with the worst family possible. Remember the family in Million Dollar Baby, so unbelievably crass that you just wanted to hit them, as well as Paul Haggis, who created the characters? The family here is ten times worse. Clint's teenage granddaughter attends her grandmother's funeral showing cleavage and her ample rear. And then her father complains that Clint is angry about the disrespect the girl is showing his dead wife! Even more confusing, Clint's son, both of his sons, actually, are dressed in suits and ties, while their sons wear football jerseys and daughters wear revealing clothing. If the parents are dressing up, wouldn't they force the kids to dress up, too? Who designed the costumes here? Who edited it? Who wrote it? And who the Hell directed it? Little of it makes any logical sense. The main body of the story is about Clint's dealing with his neighbors, a Hmong family. He becomes closer to the family after he unwittingly saves the neighbor boy, Thao, from his gang-banging cousin. Thao had previously tried to steal Clint's prized Gran Torino, and in exchange for his crime, as well as Clint's heroics, he agrees to help Clint out with chores and odd jobs. They become friends. Note to screenwriters: the Asian kids next door won't generally hang around you if you call them ""slopes"" and ""zipperheads"" to their face, no matter how much heart you have buried under a gruff exterior. Seriously, the racial epithets flow so freely, and are so often meant as comedy, that Gran Torino is going to face some major backlash because of it. There's even a memorable sequence in the film that claims that this is the way grown men speak to each other. Political correctness is, after all, for vaginae. Movies about racists aren't necessarily a bad thing, but Gran Torino crosses the line into offensiveness. This film hasn't opened in the Twin Cities yet, where the majority of Hmong people live in the United States, but I expect a slew of letters to the editor when it sees its release. So, yeah, the film has its problems. But I did find the relationship that arises between Clint and Thao, as well as Thao's sister, Sue, quite touching (if cliché). Eastwood gives a fine performance. I wouldn't call it Oscar-worthy, but it certainly beats the crap out of his performance in Million Dollar Baby, for which he was nominated for an Oscar. Its other Oscar possibility is for the title song, sung by Eastwood himself over the ending credits. It's simply awful.",

When Walt speaks he spits the most harsh one-liners in his everyday-talk, and he gives racist-remarks with nicknames only the Third Reich could ever socially accept. His voice breaths of inner demons and when he's coughing blood, it's like we can see some of the rasped, torn and dark soul inside this man. And Eastwood's performance is a goodbye-to-all-that, when slinging a gun out of his belt you can see the Man With No Name in the spaghetti westerns, Dirty Harry making your day and Bill Munny from Unforgiven, speaking of ""it's a hell of a thing, killing a man..."".",

399,21 December 2014,EdMMD,1," Worst film I've seen for years, well done Clint!","I have never written a film review before but this film urged me during the credits to find my laptop and begin my review. Firstly the main character of Walt obviously played by our ageing anti-hero Clint Eastwood is an awful representation of a human being. The film starts with the funeral of Walts wife, and he is then joined by is equally loathsome family. Walt is a retired Korean veteran who has old fashioned beliefs and strong moral codes, however is family are a disgusting portrayal of the kind of family Walt would have raised. So for me this makes no sense whatsoever, he's bitter and hates the world. Yet later in the film talks about the love of his wife, which changed his life, so why does a man with so much love in his life have such an hatred for everything?! ..Anyway back to the funeral; so on one hand Walt hates everyone yet there's a packed church for his wife??! If this evil hate filled man had anyway influenced this woman's life, she'd be just as miserable as he was and NO ONE would be attending the funeral family or otherwise. Now let's move onto the main ridiculous plot of the this farcical film. A family of Hmong (Koreans) live next door and of course Walt hates them as he does everyone. (I don't know how he gets up in the morning or for what purpose other than to hate on life). One member of this family Thao a young teenager who is also unable to speak or act for most of the film. Thao has a cousin who is part of a Gang of Four who drive round not particularly doing anything other than trying to recruit Thao who is by all accounts useless. The gang try and recruit him to steal Walts car (the Gran Torino) which fails and is caught by Walt. The pair then later build up a relationship over the next long 80 or so minutes with ridiculous growling by Clint at scenes with his family and other awful situations where the relationship grows between the old Man and the Young teenager. When I woke up the gangs were back and were doubting a cigarette on Thao's face just because he got a job on a construction site!!! Madness. This results in our hate filled Walt going to the gangs hideout and beating up one of them, not thinking they'd come back for him. His this guy out of his mind, he's a 70 something year old man who lives alone with a rifle, yeah Clint there petrified! Meanwhile the gang have access to semi automatic weapons and out number him 10-1, in reality they'd have smashed his house up and burnt it to the ground or worse just shot him in the street. I mean come on guys there either a ""gang"" we're trying to portray as ruthless thugs or are they supposed to be off a Broadway musical? The film gets worse and worse with the final scene where Walt lets himself get murdered by the gang with his genius plan that they'll all be sent to prison!! HAHAHA don't make me laugh does he really believe that 1. The community will give statements and follow this through to court even though they terrorise the neighbourhood and 2. That every member of the gang will be convicted when he's turned up at their house and used threatening behaviour to make them believe he was going to pull out a gun. 3. Finally if they were convicted surely they have connections or family other than the 4 of them to go after Thao and the witnesses. In summary loads and loads of plot holes, ridiculous acting but I have got to give credit where it's due, for someone to take a decent idea for a movie and produce this load of tripe then bravo Clint you truly are a master time thief!!!",
400,21 September 2010,KineticSeoul,8, The positive aspects overcomes the negative by a huge margin for this,"Some people that praise this movie say it's worth watching, but just wait until it comes out on DVD or Blu-ray. I disagree, yeah it's a low budget movie, but it's one of those low budget movies that is worth seeing it in theaters because of a brilliant performance by Clint Eastwood with a riveting script. This film is basically a atonement for Clint Eastwood's violent characters he played and it works really really well in this. The movie has heart and just seeing the friendship build while Clint acts as a mentor, a grumpy mentor but a good one was just brilliant with good values to go with it. So yeah, fabulous acting by Clint and a great script with values, is a must watch. Yeah it has some tiny violent scenes, but it's one of those movies that is still worth taking out your whole family to watch. Although the movie is not in theaters any more, watch this during family movie night or something. The movie will make you laugh with it's humor that has heart to it and make you sad in a good way, during the depressing scenes. Sure I agree with few of the other reviewers complaints, but there is just too many positive things about this film than the negative.",

402,14 June 2009,ensign-5,4, Dirty Harry retires to Detroit,"I have always liked Clint and I grew up in the Detroit area so I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, the movie did not deliver. It's biggest weakness (and there are many) is its dated story. The 'angry white guy struggles to come to terms with racial diversity' theme was interesting and relevant in the early 1970s (e.g, All in the Family) but it's very tired and predictable now. Within the first few minutes of the film, you just know that Eastwood's character is going to end up being friends with the Asian family next door. ",
403,11 January 2009,Greatornot,7, Entertaining but not ground breaking,"This was a nice little film but it seemed forced to me at times. The ethnic slurs were rampant. OK I get it Clint wanted to make it a point that he was a bad ass Korean war patriot or something like that and he can say what he wanted at anytime. Mr. Eastwood basically played a disgruntled bitter old man wishing for the 50s to come back. He had no passion for his children nor did they for he. He seemingly was a loyal husband now left a widower with his only passion his GRAN TORINO... hence the title. Trouble brews with the Korean family next door and Clint who at first does not like these Koreans, grows to be their friend, savior and mentor. The big bad Clint comes out saves the day over and over with various predicaments leading up to a grand finale with a gang. In summation, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie but thats just it . I do not see it as an award type movie for various reasons. The ethnic jokes and other comedic situations basically told me is the movie did not know where to go, than throw in a wet behind the ears baby faced priest and you have a silly movie. I was entertained so I guess that is the bottom-line in all this . Do not expect a shower of awards from this movie.",
404,22 January 2009,Buddy-51,8, Eastwood in his finest performance ever,"Growing old certainly seems to agree with Clint Eastwood. For popular as he was at the box office, Eastwood, in the early stages of his career at least, never seemed entirely comfortable in an actor's skin - his performances often coming across as stiff and wooden as he mumbled his way through perpetualy clenched teeth and the barest minimum of dialogue (it wasn't for no reason that critics always charitably described his early characters as ""laconic""). Yet, now that he's encased in an old man's body, that stiffness couldn't be more organic to the characters he's playing - or more effortlessly natural. In ""Gran Turino,"" Eastwood returns for one last time to the role of the lone gunslinger - whether it be on the western frontier as the Man With No Name or on the meanest of urban mean streets as Dirty Harry - that made him an icon for a generation of moviegoers who grew up on his films. Yet, it is a return tempered by the kind of wisdom and restraint that only age and a lifetime's worth of experience can bring.",
405,24 January 2009,kaihebb,1, One of the worst movies i've seen lately,"How can an awful movie like this one get so many good votes? Now that i think about it, there was nothing i could appreciate about this movie. Not only it was boring as hell but also quite cliché. The horrible acting of those teenagers made it rather hard to watch sometimes, so i just had to look away from the screen. The young boy who plays Thao really needs to learn to act and speak better (i couldn't understand most of the things he'd say). Also Mr. Eastwood's attempt at trying to be funny was pathetic i thought. The scene at the barber shop where Mr. Kowalski (Eastwood) is trying to man up Thao was supposed to be funny or at least make me smile but instead it was really lame and it failed to do any of that. This movie could have been a bit better if Eastwood had picked a better cast of actors and not just some kids who know nothing about acting. On some scenes, like the one where Thao's cousin and his gang beat up Thao or the scene where Mr. Kowalski beats up the fat guy from the gang, the violence looks completely fake. Overall the movie was very amateurish and a waste of time and money. I didn't expect much from it but I'm still surprised of how bad it was.",

Eastwood plays Walt, a recent widow whom still lives in the old neighborhood surrounded by foreigners. He's racist and mean. What I really didn't like and didn't think very realistic was when they would show him growl and grimace at people just because of the way they looked. It was over the top. The movie is about him learning tolerance and befriended his Hmong neighbors. He befriends the young girl there, Sue and her brother, Thao. Thao has a cousin in a gang that keeps trying to get him to join and Walt becomes involved. Walt is shown going to the doctor and spitting up blood.

Eastwood takes center stage here both in front of and behind the camera. Approaching his 80th birthday, he shows himself to be in his creative prime. It's not clear if Walt is really a bigot who undergoes a transformation or his gruff demeanor is just a shield he uses to guard his privacy. Perhaps the ambiguity is intentional. If this turns out to be Eastwood's final performance, it's quite a farewell. The scenes in the barber shop are hilarious, especially when Eastwood and Lynch teach Thao how real men talk.

Even that one good thing that some reviewers mentioned, and that is Clint Eastwood's acting, looks good only in comparison to the very bad job the rest of the cast does. I mean, what's with that growl? Didn't we have a multiple other hints, none of them subtle, that Mr. Kowalski is an embittered old man?

It was truly an amazing and profoundly moving experience. The story is about a grumpy, foul-mouthed, and somewhat bigoted old Korean War vet in a rundown neighborhood who is at first resistant to the change he sees his community taken over by the Hmoung (ethnic group from Southeast Asia). In most films, the cinematography is designed to glamorize what's in front of the camera, but Clint's (or should I say Walt, his character's) neighborhood is starkly unpleasant to look at.

It's a rare demonstrative piece that places two lead characters side by side, on the same equilibrium, whilst simultaneously having them uncover and discover new things about themselves; life and everything. It's an additional exploration of grizzled old men, whose minds are supposedly so elderly; experienced and 'made up' that they will never change; but actually can, in fact, suffer epiphanies of their own, at this age and at their own pace.

Here he is the crusty old ex-soldier, seeing his neighborhood change ethnicity, feeling himself getting increasingly isolated amongst the 'gooks' and 'fishheads'. His own sons are no solace in his old age. They're only interest seems to be in divvying up his belongings when he's gone. Otherwise they're strangers to him though he realizes that's not entirely their fault. He never really knew how to do the father thing. He's got an excuse of sorts, he's still haunted by faces he saw in their death throes back in Korea. But then his distaste for injustice and gangs kicks in as one of his neighbors is put in danger.

I think that Eastwood has followed the patterns of the Hollywood style to concentrate on the plot to affect our feelings more than to try to develop the characters more carefully as well as their mutual interactions with him as the main hero. On the other hand, I love the charming way he introduced all the stupidity of prejudices based on racism and especially implied it during the Asian party he was invited to. It must be very hard to direct and play the main role in the movie, so I certainly send all my respect to Clint Eastwood's work in this movie.

A few times Bee Vang's lack of the art came through. A wonderful job was done by Ahney Her. Her charm and beauty lit up the screen, and I was surprised that she wasn't a professional actress.

Once I was inside the movie theater getting popcorn, I started to wondered if this movie would either make Eastwood's last movie as a actor good or horrible. I had to see what happened and I was impressed. Clint Eastwood directed and stars in Gran Torino, a drama that focuses on a relationship between a racist Korean War veteran and his new neighbor, a Hmong immigrant. Eastwood may look old in this picture, but that doesn't means he is not bad. One night, Eastwood's character, Walt Kowalski, is alarmed when a intruder breaks into his garage. The intruder appears to be his Hmong neighbor, played by Bee Vang. He was ordered to steal Walt's 1972 Gran Torino because an Hmong gang told him to do it. Soon enough, the 1972 prized Gran Torino brings the Hmong neighbor, Thao and Walt together. Watching Gran Torino, I suddenly noticed that Eastwood's direction is the same thing as what he does in his 2004 Best Picture winner, Million Dollar Baby. The connection is that the relationship between different characters are focus on like we are seeing in his point of view. As for Eastwood, he has a great performance as Walt Kowalski. So it all adds up that Gran Torino is a modern update of Eastwood's stardom and that this film stays on that level all the time throughout. ★★★★ 4 stars.",

He strikes up a relationship with the young lad next door after catching him trying to steal his Gran Torino. Finding out that he hasn't got long to live, he makes it his mission to save the lad, Thao, whom he calls 'Toad' for most of the movie, from the gangland culture.
This is one of the best movies I have seen in years. It is funny, moving and brings out things that are true to all of us; the family who only want us for what they can get out of us, the people who do care but we don't realise, the ones around us who need our help and the sacrifices we can give. It shows the relationships we experience, in Eastwood case a Priest who promised that he would look after him.
The scene in the barbershop between Walt, barber Martin and Thao is just so funny.
Star performances from Eastwood and the supporting cast as they act a fantastically scripted moving with a cracking soundtrack. Listen at the end and you will hear the trademark grumbling tones of Eastwood singing the theme 'Gran Torino' which crosses into Jamie Cullum.

And this coming from a man who created some of film's Greatest heroes or antiheroes Josey Wales Dirty Harry The man with no name and many others. This film continues the trend Eastwood began with the Flag of our Fathers and continued with Letters from Iwo Jima. Humanizing the after effects of the trauma of war. Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski a bitter Korea War vet he's not happy with the way his life has gone he's not happy with the past and he's certainly not happy with the present and the future the way it's shaping out to be. His wife has died and his neighborhood has gone to the Asians in fact his neighbors are a family of Hmong who are having problems of their own. their world's collide when the oldest boy is pressured by his cousin to join his gang his initiation steal Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torino. When Walt stop's the car theft and saves the boy from the gang their world's become intertwined. Walt the loner does not want anything to do with them but slowly he gets drawn in and soon he cares deeply about the boy Thao almost as much as a father cares for a son. Comedy and tragedy mix in equal combinations to create one of the most stunning finishes I have ever seen in any movie that even now still lingers even after the movie has been long over. This is not a movie for the sensitive nor the political correct. But rather a movie for everyone caught up in a future they never could've seen coming and anyone caught in a culture clash they can't understand but Eastwood does and this is his statement and it is a powerful one. They Say Gran Torino is Eastwood's last time acting well if so he left on a grand high note.,

It's funny to see that though the 'prize' Gran Torino is all that is hyped in the title and above the entire story, it only has the slightest of significance in the actual scenes. The story blends well the fatherhood and responsibilities and the atonement background for it.

I know that elder people often look like this and act like this, but Clint went to extreme point. I even wonder how did this sad old man manage to live with golden retriever dog? I used to have a labrador retriever and can say that dogs of such breed will never make you feel sad. OK, Clint tried to act at least. All these ""gooks"" were not acting, but just spending time. Sue and Tao characters were underdeveloped and underperformed. All gangster characters, no matter - black or Asian, were just ridiculous.

Eastwood directing himself has the same problem. In Million Dollar Baby the performances were boring and pointless - and in Gran Torino they are just sad.

Scenes at Volt's home were extremely complex. The viewer needs to feel the lack of space but, on the other hand, should not be visually limited. His belongings, tools, weapons and even the cars, Eastwood and director of photography Tom Stern have incorporated in the image of Volt's everyday life. Locations are authentic; we got the feeling of a small community that lives its life. ""Gran Torino"" is well filmed, the coordination of the staff and space is at a high level.

In the house next to him there is a family whose young boy Thao is harassed and bullyed by a gang of other youg Asians. Walt Kowalski, our war veteran begins to react rudely and uncongenially to these neighbours but after an unhappy incident created by the young Thao he changes his attitude and starts a friendly relationship with Thao and his family and tries even to protect them against the gang above and takes revenge against them.

Whether for directing it, or for the character that he portrays in Gran Torino. A lot of people have described his character Walt as being ""Racist"", but I would have to disagree with that. In watching the Movie he let's a lot of racial slurs fly. His Character is very complex. What comes out of his mouth doesn't always line up to his actions. I would say he is more like a ""Archie Bunker"" type from all in the Family. But a lot more complex. I don't wanna give a way the movie or the character, but I think Clint Eastwood broke ground with this character. Because Walt in a ""Non Traditional"" racist. Whatever that means, lol.

But no man is an island and life ultimately intrudes into Walt's world in the form of the Catholic priest of his church and a Hmong family that lives next door. Initially Walt has little use for the priest and nothing but racial slurs and contempt for his neighbors--he calls the young teenage boy who lives there ""Zipperhead,"" a derogatory term he probably picked up when he was in the Korean war. The young boy's name is Thao and, in his more considerate moods, Walt calls him ""Toad."" As an initiation rite to get into a gang Thao is tasked with stealing Walt's prized 1972 Ford Gran Torino; this theft goes very wrong and Thao almost winds up being shot by Walt in the act of the theft.

474,11 January 2009,writerasfilmcritic,8," ""Gran Torino"" Eastwood's Best Effort Since ""Unforgiven""","Without seeing ""Gran Torino"" another time or two, it will be hard to judge just how good it really is. The movie certainly engages the viewer and tugs at his or her emotions without becoming maudlin or sappy, making it difficult to maintain a dispassionate and objective perspective as to its quality. Despite Walt's excessive boozing, continued smoking, and free use of racial stereotypes and epitaphs, the fact that he has a good heart in there somewhere is immediately evident, if difficult to discern. It takes a spirited young Hmong girl, one of his neighbors, to see right past his carefully erected defenses, and her brother, who is teetering on the brink of going bad, to give him a renewed sense of purpose following the death of his wife. One spot in the film came off a little weak, that being the scene at the barbershop where Walt was attempting to ""man up"" Tao by encouraging him to relate to others in the same way he does. Further, I think the crusty old Korean War vet came around to getting along with his neighbors just a might too quickly, considering the degree of contempt in which he'd held them before the initial incident that brought them closer. Could he really go over to the party at Sue's invitation and then settle into place rather easily what with all the suspicious and disapproving stares from the other guests? One would think he would just stalk off in disgust. Perhaps time constraints disallowed a more gradual lessening of suspicion and hostility. Finally, I suspect Walt shouldn't have had to defend the good Hmong from the Hmong gang. After all, they are not babies but obviously are a tough people and should have taken care of those punks in their own quiet way. These minor criticisms aside, I found the movie quite moving and Walt to be easily one of Eastwood's best characterizations. He deserves an Academy Award nomination for the role and probably the Oscar, itself. The young Hmong girl, Sue, also deserves recognition. We didn't fully realize her importance until the end of the movie. Her strong spirit is every bit as inspiring as Walt's.",
475,12 January 2009,petit76,9, worth seeing,"Manohla Dargis writes in the New York Times: ""Dirty Harry is back, in a way, in ""Gran Torino,"" not as a character but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film, in its themes and high-caliber imagery, and of course most obviously in Mr. Eastwood's face. It is a monumental face now, so puckered and pleated that it no longer looks merely weathered, as it has for decades, but seems closer to petrified wood. Words like flinty and steely come to mind, adjectives that Mr. Eastwood ... expressively embodies with his usual lack of fuss and a number of growls."" More praise for Eastwood comes from Joe Morgenstern in the Wall Street Journal, who comments: ""No one makes movies like Gran Torino any more, and more's the pity. This one, with Clint Eastwood as director and star, is concerned with honor and atonement, with rough justice and the family of man. It raises irascibility to the level of folk art, takes unapologetic time-outs for unfashionable moral debates, revives acting conventions that haven't been in fashion for half a century and keeps you watching every frame as Mr. Eastwood snarls, glowers, mutters, growls and grins his way through the performance of a lifetime."" Elizabeth Weitzman in the New York Daily News remarks that ""it's clearly a career-capping work."" Kenneth Turan in The Los Angeles Times writes that the movie ""is impossible to imagine without the actor in the title role. The notion of a 78-year-old action hero may sound like a contradiction in terms, but Eastwood brings it off, even if his toughness is as much verbal as physical. Even at 78, Eastwood can make 'Get off my lawn' sound as menacing as 'Make my day,' and when he says 'I blow a hole in your face and sleep like a baby,' he sounds as if he means it."" There are at least four reason why I like this film: 1. Clint Eastwood shows that the character he is playing is willing to serve in a war-- and die if necessary--to preserve freedom (and he has a medal to prove it), 2. he has grown old and the whole world has changed (and everyone around him seems to indicate--in one way or another--that he is no appreciated or needed), 3. even with a transformation, he demonstrates that people tend to be reactive--rather than responsive--and are slow to change (this is particularly true with bias, discrimination, and prejudice), and 4. that tolerance can lead to understanding (he tries to give tough love, but he becomes softer in his response--instead of his reaction--after giving and receiving genuine love). It seems that everyone around him wants his Gran Torino and everything else he owns, before he even has died, instead of being interested in him. He lives in a community that is transformation, and he knows absolutely nothing about culture, diversity, ethnicity, race, or sexual orientation. He does know about aging, however (if nowhere else, he learns about it from people's adverse and negative reactions, everywhere around him).

It had a great storyline, good message, some funny moments, and some heart-breaking moments. Clint Eastwood was awesome as Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran who is very cranky, grumpy, and racist. He lives in a neighborhood dominated by poor Asian immigrants and infested with gangs. A young Hmong boy named Thao Lor who agrees to an initiation which requires him to steal Walt's prized car, a 1972 Ford Gran Torino, but Walt stops him. Walt finally befriends Thao's family, and tries to help Thao become a man, and learn responsibility. When a Hmong gang threatens the Lor family, Walt knows what he must do. I highly recommend GRAN TORINO!!!",

Did the even research Asian culture they depicted or did they just swap in stereotypes about black people. CLint Eastwood's character is racist the entire movie, openly and the Asian characters laugh or put up with it. THe character of Thao is shown to be weak and needs Clint Eastwood, a white man to teach him how to act. There is a scene where Thao's sister interacts with black men and well, it racist. The black men want to rape her and her hip-hip white boy boyfriend is a pussy who tries to befriend the black guys until CLint Eastwood, or super Whitey comes to save the day, call the black guys a racial slur and point a gun at them. THao's cousins are gangsters and when he doesn't join their gang they rape his sister. THe hell? That never happens, I mean they raped their cousin. Once again Clint saves the day and sacrifices his life for his Asain friends. He leaves Thao a Gran Torino and says racist things about every ethnicity in his will.

Here he plays a grandfather and widower with a secret but serious medical condition who gets in a back and forth with a nasty Korean gang. Along the way he first offends and then befriends the Korean family next door, the children ""Toad"" and ""Sue"" being particularly exquisitely played, they in part make this movie.

490,11 January 2009,MRavenwood,8, Deliciously Politically Incorrect,"This movie feels like a cross between a modern film and 1970s-era Hollywood movie. Great acting, good story, and funny. Yet, it still is escapist entertainment and not a movie trying to sell you some philosophy. Very politically incorrect, which is refreshing without being a send-up. I won't give away any plot, but Eastwood plays a hard case, as you might expect. However, the supporting cast is pretty well drawn and has dimension that would be lacking in a run-of-the-mill revenge shoot-'em up. He gets a little push-back which keeps his character from being a cartoon. Clint Eastwood got some great performances out of these actors. You should start congratulating him now on his nomination for best director - there's no way it's not coming. The movie opened last weekend, but the 10p.m. showing tonight was sold out and we actually couldn't get a seat so we stood in the aisle rather than sit in the second row of seats. It was worth it to stand. Our whole audience laughed a lot and otherwise reacted, so the film ""plays"" to a diverse group and wide range of ages, although it is rated R for language, gang violence, and the requisite ""adult themes"". On that subject if you are sensitive to course language, this film is not for you. Having said that, your kids or friends probably already talk this way, so if you really don't like hearing the F-word as it is used by modern kids, then steer clear of this one.",

Clint does possess some of those qualities in his ""Walt"" character but to me, the movie was about him developing qualities of acceptance...of his neighbors, of his stint in Vietnam. It was so beautifully told, very moving. To watch his ""gruff"" character grow was amazing. I won't spoil the ending, but I would have preferred something different than what happened. I will also have to admit, I could have done without Clint's singing during the credits, but I was impressed he wrote (or co-wrote?) the song!

It hasn't even opened wide yet and already ranks #184 of all time on IMDb. I'll agree that it is a very good movie, well composed and paced with a fantastic final act; I just can't quite allow myself to call it a masterpiece. As I said, I'm a fan of Eastwood the director, not necessarily Eastwood the actor, and, with his performance here as Walt, I won't be changing that mindset. I found myself laughing more often at his growls and scowls than feeling fear or menace. He isn't the only one at fault, though; I think everyone falls pretty flat acting-wise here. I'll give the Hmong characters some slack being that they aren't trained actors, but instead authentic people from that culture, and kudos to the filmmakers for going that route. As for our lead, the priest (a very uninspired Christopher Carley), and even a couple good actors as Walt's sons in very limited roles, I found their performances detracting from a solid story.",

I was surprised when it was subsequently snubbed, but when I saw it, I understood why. GRAN TORINO is a bit too over-the-top and predictable for serious Oscar consideration. It is watchable, yes. But is it a modern-day classic? No. Clint Eastwood's acting is good, but not great, as he conjures up memories of Dirty Harry with the ever-present scowl and occasional growl. There is even one scene where he could pass for Bruce Banner, just prior to transformation. His character arc and eventual conclusion is a bit flawed, and not well developed. There is no real progressive change, but the development takes place in stages. Nonetheless, his acting is quite watchable. I am still not quite sure of what to make of the supporting actors Bee Vang and Ahney Her. In some instance, the acting is amateurish, while in some scenes, they are rather fantastic. Their acting will likely garner mixed reviews as a result.",

500,19 June 2012,KnightsofNi11,7, Has it's issues but a great character study overall,"At one point in our lives we've all known an old curmudgeon like the one Clint Eastwood plays in Gran Torino. We're all familiar with how they act, the things they say, and the way they don't make an effort to hide their true feelings at any given moment. But not all of us have known an elderly person in the kind of situation we see in Gran Torino. Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a grumbling, bigoted, and disgruntled Korean War veteran living in inner city Detroit in a run down neighborhood. Walt lives alone and tries his best to keep to himself, but his seclusion runs out when he finds himself the metaphorical caretaker of Thao and Sue, two Hmong siblings living next door to Walt with their family. He sets out to change Thao into a real man, while also keeping he and his sister safe from the rampant gang violence prevalent in the neighborhood. The story is oddly touching with, while also possessing a streak of pleasant humor throughout.",
501,10 March 2020,Svenstadt,1, Another set-piece movie that is like a bad night at the theatre.,"This movie is just riddled with inaccuracies and mistakes. First of all, a Catholic priest will NEVER come to you to coerce a confession out of you! EVER!! Second, being a nostalgic older man who is behind the times is not a sin!! Neither is having an unfavorable attitude about the bad things happening in your neighborhood! Neither is being rigid and stubborn!!
That said, Clint's acting has hit a new low. His grumble whenever something annoys him is about as forced as his twin-speech on Dirty Harry.
Another error is the portrayal of Asian people in general. Asians definitely don't run around in that many gangs throughout America, and are generally not so incompetent even if they do!! The scene where they bring massive amounts of gifts to Walt's front door is stereotypical and insulting as hell!!! So is the portrayal of Asian religious beliefs!!
As is usual with the race hustlers in this country, they get almost everything wrong, including the identity of the problem!! This movie moves within about 1 square block of this tiny street with row houses, and a grumpy guy with a small lawn!! The movie is about as preachy as a high school health class video!!!
The story revolves around the stealing of this old man's prized possession, a Gran Torino car, in mint condition. A slow witted Asian with some form of autism, is coerced by his gang-member distant relatives to steal it, which he fails to do!! I mean, that scene was about as bad as it could get!!! You can't sympathize with a character who never speaks!!! This entire film is riddled with very embarrassing misnomers.
In the end, they turn this Walt Kowalski guy into the liberal conformist pushover they want him to be!! It's just entirely embarrassing and insulting to the intelligence of the audience!!! The idea that there would be gangs in this multi-ethnic city without any drug dealing is just absurd!!!
Another aspect of this that I found is that this movie is abusive towards white people!! You heard right!!! There is an old, mean Asian grandmother who, from her front porch, begins releasing a diatribe to Walt about how he should have moved out long ago!! I'm sorry, this whole line of thinking is an abusive excuse for abusing white people!!! This idea that we should have moved if we didn't want to have to deal with the crime in our area!!! This idea that it is somehow a sin to be 'behind the times'!!!",

507,18 January 2009,cultfilmfan,10, Gran Torino,"Gran Torino is about a recently widowed elderly man named Walt Kowalski who lives in a more run down area of town and Walt is personally haunted by demons of his past and is a very conservative and bigoted person in his old age. He disapproves of a lot of the things the younger generation is now doing, can not relate to his sons, or grandsons or granddaughters and particularly has a problem with the new Oriental neighbours that moved just next door to him. The film eventually deals with Walt getting over some of his prejudices and making friends with the two neighbour children and bonding with them and also doing whatever he can to protect them from a gang that is targeting the two of them. The trailers and advertisements for Gran Torino make it look like an action film, or very much like one of the Dirty Harry films star and director Clint Eastwood would have done in the 70's, but this is actually quite different than what the trailers and advertisements would lead you to believe. The gang violence and dealing with them is a large enough part of this story, but I would say that the relationship that grows between the two neighbour children and Walt is the real story here and the one that is mostly focused on. Walt's own problems from past experiences to his current state of life are also a big burden on his life and we get to know more about Walt as the film goes on. What once looked like a cantankerous, bitter and racist old man actually through good storytelling is transformed into a really human and complex character with many deep layers that would need to be unraveled in order to help him and for him to be at peace. I personally really liked how the film's screenplay developed the Walt character and the others as well and there was a good mix of character study, drama, some amusing moments and even some action in the film and they all worked really well together in telling a powerful and thought provoking study of our own selves and the things we must change, or forget to move on in life. The screenplay is top notch allowing for some great one liners from Walt and an interesting and compelling story that is sure to interest most viewers who would give the film a chance. Clint Eastwood's direction also suit's the film well and more than anything one thing that really carries this film is Clint Eastwood's performance as Walt. Like I mentioned earlier at first Walt comes off as a grouchy and bigoted old man saying racist and bigoted things like he didn't care who heard them and then he almost becomes like a father figure to these kids living next door and we see the things he has continually struggled with in his life and how he sets to personally get rid of them. Overall a very powerful performance and one of Clint Eastwood's best that is definitely Best Actor worthy material. I also give Clint and the film's screenwriter a lot of credit for making a film that is so edgy at times and I think people who are worried about being offended, or turned off by the film should give it a chance and see that there is so much more to the film than just Walt's racist language. Overall a surprisingly moving, compelling and a great character study movie with an excellent performance makes Gran Torino one of 2008's best films.",

Eastwood has done some fantastic acting, but seems a bit of a caricature here. The other actors leave a lot to be desired. A lot. Bits here and there were funny or touching, but did not add up to much. The progression of the gang story line didn't seem believable. A lot didn't seem believable.

Though the role of Walt Kowalski was apparently not written with Eastwood specifically in mind, it is almost impossible to think otherwise, as so much in the film depends upon the screen persona that Eastwood has painstakingly constructed in the minds of audiences over his several decades of screen stardom (drawing, in particular, upon the four films he did as Detective ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan, the iconic vigilante cop). The marketing suggests that this is just another such vigilante story, pitting the now 78-year-old Eastwood against another gang of ethnic toughs for the safety of his neighbours (which probably set stereotype alarms off in many a viewer). However, what the trailer suggests is not much like what the film delivers.",

But Clint carries the movie, so it is easy enough to overlook any other problems with it. It is so nice to see a movie that appeals to adults like myself (I'm 52). I get so mad at the R-rated comedies that I keep vowing never to see one again. This movie is R-rated only for the profanity, and as such, could easily be seen by anyone over the age of 10 (because they will have already heard all the words in school). What is nice about seeing a movie like this in a crowded theater (my wife and I had to sit almost in the front of the theater because we got there right before it started) is you get the mass laughs and other responses. There are PLENTY of laughs in this movie! The racist lead character is funny to view, because we have all probably known someone like him in our past; usually it's not mean-spirited, just ignorant. Clint's character's ignorance is corrected as the movie progresses, and at the end, unless you are as cold-hearted as he appears to be at the start, you will cry! This is a great movie because it tells a great story, and has a pretty good lesson. It reminded me a little of the Paul Newman movie, ""Nobody's Fool"" (a movie, which unfortunately was forced to be R-rated by the producers by a stupid quick nude scene, because they didn't think G-rated movies made money) This movie pretty much had to have the profanity (unless they bleeped it out, which I guess would seem awkward) to reflect some of the low-life characters who abound these days. That is the only caution I would see for children, is that they would get a false impression of how most people talk to each other by viewing this film. All around though, well worth seeing.",

Tough as nails, not very friendly. Has two sons, but is distant in relations with them (understandably, once you get to learn about them). He is just about as politically INCORRECT as a guy can be in 2008. So if you are into political correctness big time, you may not like this movie. But as the movie progresses, viewer comes to realize that inside his incredibly CRUSTY exterior, Walt really has a heart of gold. The family living next door to him are Hmongs, from the hills of Laos. They are steeped in tradition. But after getting way off on the wrong foot (the Hmong son is practically ""forced"" by cousins/ gang members to try to steal Walt's Gran Torino!), the two households grow closer and closer. Walt becomes their bodyguard in a way. The Village Idiot cousins refuse to back off, and Walt decides to take a drastic action. But what endeared this movie to me were some of the quotes. After Hmong women continue to bring him food as a thank you, tho he tries to resist, he is overcome by them and says, ""Jesus, Joseph and Mary. These Hmong broads are like badgers."" LOL LOL",

It was very emotional and great to see Clint Eastwood at his last work. He was excellent in the film. He definitely should deserve the Oscar for Best Actor. Yes, he was that good. Another thing. The story is very interesting and not a lot of movies can have the same plot feel. It's about a war veteran from the Korean War and lots of Asian people started moving into his neighborhood. He's developed a certain dislike for Asians because of the war, and he was mean to them. So when one day an Asian kid tries to steal his prized possession: his 1972 Gran Turino.

538,5 September 2013,bbewnylorac,8, Great film,"For me, only the prevalence of violence prevents this film gaining an even greater rating. It's one of Clint Eastwood's best roles, but the script is the real star, with most lines zinging off the page. While Walt (Eastwood) is, on the surface, an unattractive character - crotchety, mean, selfish, set in his ways -- gradually you come to understand him, and even love him. He has many good qualities, such as loyalty to his friends, honesty, and willingness to stand up for others and for justice. Underneath his biting wit is harsh experience, hurt and cynicism but also, eventually, a fierce affection for his new Asian neighbours. The film makers take a risk in running many lines about race, although it does highlight the many conflicted tensions of Walt's neighbourhood. And it demonstrates Walt's petty prejudices, despite being from a migrant background himself. I laughed and laughed at many of the lines but then at the end I cried fat tears. The ending was excessively violent but a startling concept, and not out of the realms of possibility, given Walt's extreme character traits. The actor Ahney Her, playing Walt's Hmong neighbour Sue, gives an outstanding performance - full of firey challenges to Walt's racist rants, ignorance, bullsh-t and bravado, even though she is much younger than him. It evolves into a combative but strong affection between them, as she realises there is a heart behind Walt's bitter and tough exterior.",

540,30 August 2021,TheHonestCritic,10, One of Clint Eastwood's greatest films? Check out my review below to find out!,"""Gran Torino"" (2008), for those who may not know, this is the very first Clint Eastwood movie I saw in a theater. I've seen bits and pieces of his films before that. But, this was the first movie of his that I watched all the way through from beginning to end. What a phenomenal first impression! ""Gran Torino"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is, a recently widowed veteran named Walt Kowalski isolates himself from his family and he is angry with the world itself. At first glance, that sounds like a dull and miserable story. But, here's the thing, I went into the movie theater not knowing what to expect. For that reason alone, I wound up enjoying it that much more! Sometimes, it's better to go into a film for the first time not knowing what to expect and be open-minded. I won't go into any details regarding the plot. But, it's a story that you will remember for the rest of your life, with a surprise ending that you won't see coming. Another thing I love about this movie is how anti-political correct it is. All of the racist remarks are hysterical and make me laugh every single time I see it. Now, some people may find it offensive, but I think it's hilarious! As I always say, we all have to laugh at ourselves once in a while. If you follow that philosophy in your life, then no one will be able to offend you whatsoever. The ironic thing is, that Walt is able to look past his racist thoughts and gets along with his Asian neighbors next door. Fun fact, this movie marked a rare display of Hmong culture in the world of cinema. It's always cool to see different world cultures being introduced into films and TV shows! All human races around the world deserve a chance to express themselves and their cultures on the screen. All of the acting is phenomenal from the whole entire cast! But, the best performance comes from the one, and only Clint Eastwood. Not only did he act in this movie, he also produced and directed it as well. Wow, talk about multi-tasking! Right? Some people in the film industry are better with acting, some are better with producing or directing, etc. Very few can do all of those jobs seamlessly and Clint Eastwood is one of those few individuals. He is a fantastic film maker! The rest of the cast is exceptional as well. Every one of them really helps to bring their characters to life and make you care for them all personally. When any actor or actress makes you care about their characters, then you know that you have a winner. Fun Fact, Clint Eastwood's son, Scott Eastwood, has a cameo scene as Trey, Sue's date. I didn't realize that until just about five years ago, that was one of Clint Eastwood's kids. What a cool revelation! All the members of the cast really nail their characters, and then some. One thing I enjoy about Clint Eastwood films, is that he very rarely uses mainstream actors and actresses in his casts. He picks people with any amount of acting experience, and chooses whoever best fits the roles. That works brilliantly! I like how Clint gives lesser known actors and actresses a chance to shine in his movies. That just makes his films all the more unique, and this movie is no exception. The chemistry on the screen is impeccable. Props to the casting agents! All of the sets/locations are beautiful and give the film a nice atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in Michigan! All of the special effects are perfect and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, being made in 2008! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Kyle Eastwood, is phenomenal and his film score sets the perfect tone for the story. Kyle Eastwood is also Clint Eastwood's son. Great musical talent definitely runs in the family! The whole film score is outstanding, but my three favorite tracks are: the opening theme, the ending theme and ""Arrested"". I could randomly hear either of those songs, and pinpoint them to this movie right away. That's the mark of a brilliant film score! ""Gran Torino"" is another masterpiece in the world of Clint Eastwood movies. It's one of those films where you think you know what's going to happen. But, you have no idea! For that reason alone, it makes it much more entertaining and intriguing to watch. To tell you the truth, the more I watch it, the more I enjoy it! This film is definitely one of my top five favorite Clint Eastwood movies. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Gran Torino"", what are you waiting for? Go and see it today! I promise that you'll love it as much as I do. If you don't see it, then Walt Kowalski might hunt you down!",

But none of them do, not a single member of the entire gang. Apparently they just sit there and wait for the police to arrive to be arrested. This is the one and only flaw in the script but it is such a major one involving the resolution of the problem that we just can't get beyond it.

It took us two classes to watch it all but it never stop being entertaining and the feeling of wanting to know what comes next was persistent. It's a movie that starts with the death of the protagonist's wife and from there you have to unleash the layers of his backstory. It's hard to understand him since he talks with a racist vocabulary and keeps himself in a grumpy mood but nevertheless you learn to like him. Not to mention his blunt and quite laughable personality. The whole movie revolves on his growing relationship with the Hmongs, the family next door and the issues that come with them. This issues ultimately lead to the unexpected end. Unexpected but not disappointing in my opinion. If you were looking for some action then maybe this is not your movie at all because even though action happens it's not the point of the movie. There is a meaning behind it. A meaning on why he did what he did. Themes like family, racism, loyalty, friendship, love, crime, security, war and religion take an appearance. What does war do to a man? What's family?

569,12 May 2020,jayjaycee,10, It's all about life and death,"""Gran Torino"" is a 2008 drama directed by Clint Eastwood starring him and Bee Vang. Not many people have managed to stay relevant in Hollywood for more than fifty years and be known to several different generations like Clint Eastwood did. The legend is the prime example of seemingly never-ending fame, as he established himself as an actor at an early age and discovered his talent as a not less brilliant director in the sere and yellow as well. While I can't really call myself a fan of his acting roles of the beginning of his career (I haven't seen enough titles to judge that), I certainly consider myself an admirer of his later work and especially his directorial features. From merciless western ""Unforgiven"" over heartbreaking sports drama ""Million Dollar Baby"" to this 2008 feature I love all of them, and the last two received perfect scores as I have watched them early in January 2018. Since it has been more than two years since I watched them both and my taste in films has changed a lot since then, I decided to finally revisit them and see if they still live up to their perfect rating. In the case of this one, I can say beforehand, it definitely still does. What Eastwood has created with this movie is nothing short of masterfully breathtaking drama. In the focus of the film is his character Walt Kowalski, a grumpy old racist who seems to be annoyed by everyone and everything, especially after his wife has passed away. The only relatives he has left are his grown-up sons and their own families, the thing is that the relationship between them is rather estranged and dysfunctional than happy and healthy. Hence, he is a loner who is only accompanied by his dog Daisy and a lot of alcohol. The fact that he is a total racist and probably knows more racial slurs than common words should not make him any more congenial, but surprisingly, it is still impossible to hate him completely, as the tough cookie still shows a lot of vulnerability at times that gives him a lot of sympathy to him. What I am trying to say is that the way the film establishes its original and tremendously authentic characters is without a doubt one of its biggest strengths, because how is it plausible to still like a racist character? The answer is the background. It is often mentioned that Walt served in the Korean War and that it is the burnt in enemy image that created his basic scorn for Asian people, especially for his Hmong neighbours, but one of the most outstanding things this film depicts that it is possible that a stubborn old man like him with an obviously outdated world view allows himself to learn and over the course of the film discover a new form of sympathy he never felt before. It is one of the most outstanding character developments I have ever seen in a motion picture. Seriously. As he accidentally saves the Hmong family next door from being killed, he becomes a hero against his own will and that is where his transformation begins. The more he gets to know about the foreign culture, the people and their habits and realizes that he actually has a lot in common with them, the more he overcomes his stereotypical thinking. Even when he sometimes makes a prejudice induced comment, it is not tolerated just like this, because his opposite knows how to deal with his quirks and actually offending behaviour. While it is Thao who affronts him in the second half of the film, it is teenage girl Sue who defies him with her sassy but extremely smart clap backs and thus earns his respect in the process. It is palpable that he more and more takes them into his heart and accepts that all his previous prejudices turn out to be wrong. Why else would he take the boy under his wings who almost stole his car, the titular Gran Torino, and who he almost killed after he has caught him while attempting that? He and Thao more and more from and unlikely teacher-and-student bond and even friendship in the process and he even worries about him and Sue and wants to enable that both of them have a bright future and don't end up on the street of the ghetto they live in, like most of the people from that area do. The man who hated everyone and everything that is related to the Asian culture suddenly learns a lot about compassion and benevolence, they even sort of become the family he wished he had. It is even getting to the point that he realizes that the local gang is the only reason why his new friends will never have the future he wants them to have. As things escalate heavily, he knows the only solution and as the viewer I thought he would take it in his own hands and kill everyone who stands in his way, but what happened then is what I consider to be one of the greatest moments in the history of drama. Instead of the bloody massacre everyone probably expected, he makes the ultimate sacrifice and makes sure that he gets killed without carrying a weapon himself. Who does he manage to do that? In this extremely intelligent scene that was sort of foreshadowed before, he pretends to draw his gun, only to reveal that he was reaching for his lighter. Thus, every member of the criminal gang is charged for murder of an unarmed man, what allows the neighbourhood to become safe for a very long time. I am not ashamed to admit that this scene once again made me cry, because this selfless act is not just beautiful but also indescribably breathtaking. The antihero who almost shot everyone with his rifle in the beginning ends up sacrificing himself so that the same people will live in peace after all. If you can tell me a better redemption story and character conversion, go ahead and make my day. On top of that, there is also the fact that it is implied that he is suffering from a fatal disease and instead of taking it to the grave he is using it for a pure act of charity. I think this is just the final statement of the life and death metaphoric that is constantly conveyed throughout the film, mostly through the conversations between Walt and Father Janovich. He has killed dozens of people in the past and was only honoured for murder, so to make peace with himself, he settles the score by sacrificing himself in order to ensure the future of his loved ones and thus will be remembered for giving life. He settled his affairs and uses it for something selfless. If that doesn't make me cry, I don't know what does. What underlines this feeling even more is Eastwood's powerful and versatile performance and the tremendously intelligently written dialogues. The fact that the film ends with the reading of the will in which he gives everything he has ever owned (including the precious car) to the ones who really cared for him instead of his own flesh and blood rounds it all up perfectly. It is never to late to learn and make amends and this film shows it in a masterful way. All in all, this drama remains one of my favourite dramas and still holds up to its original perfect score. In all its facets, this film is perfect to me, as it includes a perfectly build up story and character development, a powerhouse performance of its lead actor, extremely intelligent dialogue and authentic characters. This film undoubtedly has got a lot of heart and doesn't fail to tantalise my emotions. It is amazingly original, brutally realistic and touching and most importantly, beautifully heartbreaking. Some people might not agree, but this film is pure perfection to me and deservedly ranks up extremely high in the list of my all-time favourites. Clint Eastwood is an absolute legend and this film is the proof why.",

Eastwood used it as an opportunity to characterize the urban white working class as nothing more than ignorant bigots and racists. His Walt Kowalski character hates everyone who is not white and lets out a string of racial slurs at every opportunity until he is ""educated"" by the ""sophisticated"" Hmongs. Give me a break. Eastwood spent nearly his entire adult life among the Hollywood elites. He knows nothing about working class America. He does the same thing in many of his films. Letters from Iwo Jima portrayed the US Marines as thugs while the Japanese were cultured and educated warriors. All his cop movies showed the police as either violent psychopaths willing to break the law to get the baddy or bureaucratic fools. His Heartbreak Ridge showed the Marines again as frat boys while the officers and senior NCOs were useless fools. Bridges of Madison county was a huge rip on middle class values like the family, marriage and morality. Go away Clint. Go away.",

To me, the message was this: How we each deal with our humanity is different, but born of the same shortcomings (i.e. fear, ignorance, etc). Less realistic aspects of the movie and any technical critiques fade away when a story is as rich in sentiment. There is some clumsy scripting and chemistry amongst characters... but it could also be interpreted as an intentional awkwardness to highlight the cultural divide between Kowalski and his Hmong neighbors. It was refreshing to see an intimate portrayal of someone that our politically correct and morally righteous modern day world would otherwise not tell the tale of let alone allow to be the hero. The non-recognizable actors added an authenticity to the struggling, lower middle class families they were meant to represent. Clint Eastwood's character, although not at all like myself on the exterior, was very relatable. To me he was a person standing outside of the absurdity of it all and struggling to find sense and happiness. Some of the more powerful moments could have had longer screen time, such as the return of Sue. All in all it was an original and worthwhile film that I would recommend to others.",

The real story is mostly in the silences - the lost wife, the watching by the shaman, the aborted telephone call....this is what you watch.

587,18 August 2009,Fever,9, powerful and compelling,"In recent months of boring and useless movies, ""Gran Torino"" was a welcome change of pace. Clint Eastwood was amazing as always-- he should've won an Oscar for this role. Eastwood plays a man who recently lost his wife and struggles to find his own way alone and dealing with his ""immigrant"" neighbors. His own well-meaning and loving, but ultimately selfish family try to help him through his loss, but end up being more obnoxious than useful (come on, a big button phone as a birthday present?) He then befriends his young next door neighbor as Eastwood becomes the unwilling hero of the neighborhood for standing up to a group of gang members. His stoic, old-school and unwaivering beliefs make Eastwood's character come off as cold and uncaring, but he ends up showing Toad (as he called him) more guidance and love than he did his own sons. Though Eastwood's comments about ""non-whites"" are racist, they are incredibly funny and well-timed. Only someone that old could get away with comments like that. He reminded me much of my own grandfather whose racist statements left my jaw dropped at times. As Eastwood takes Toad under his wing, he teaches the young man about hard work, how to ""converse like a man"" and even how to hit on women. He also befriends Toad's sister as she has a tongue as quick and obnoxious as Eastwood's. I won't give away the main events or the ending, but it is powerful and bittersweet. This was a very impressive movie and I highly recommend it to everyone.",
588,16 January 2009,jaredlallatin,10," Clint Eastwood's Best Work Ever, and that is a Bold comment considering all he has done.","How can I give this film less than a 10? Even if it stood alone as the only film Clint Eastwood ever made it would still have to be given a rating of 10. There have been many powerful scenes orchestrated on film, but none more powerful than the last scene of Gran Torino combined with the beautiful composition of music accompanied by Clint Eastwood's voice. I will not give up any details of the film in this review, because I wouldn't dare rob a single viewer of the pure satisfaction of this work of film making perfection. Go see this movie! You will not be disappointed! Every scene is crafted with beautiful story telling. As I watched Walt Kowalski interact with the other characters I couldn't help but think of my beloved late Grandfather Lallatin. He was discharged from the Army two days before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor so he went right back in to be stationed on Angle Island where he guarded Japanese prisoners of war. During the war my Grandfather's youngest brother, Keith, was killed in the Meat Grinder on Iwa Jima. Grandpa was the oldest brother by 13 years and Keith was only 19. He carried that loss with him his entire life. If anything came on TV advertising something made in Japan, Grandpa would go out of the room mumbling ""Damn Jap Crap"", and would get mad at him for being prejudice against the Japanese. My Dad raised me to never judge someone by their culture, ethnicity or race, only by their character. Thing is, we always had Japanese exchange students growing up and Grandpa alway treated them with kindness. It was just in the privacy of his own home that he expressed he prejudice. I came to understand him before he died...but this review is not about my Grandpa, it is about Gran Torino. Go see this film! It is film making greatness! It is, in my opinion Eastwood's best work ever. In a year with a lot of great films, this one deserves all the big awards! See it! You will be glad you did!",

597,25 April 2012,elliotminorjosh,6, Eastwood Gold,"Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood's masterpiece picture, both as an actor and as a director. It almost feels like Eastwood is an older version of Christopher Nolan, at the fact that every film made is astounding. Westerns aren't made much these days. This is a largely known fact. So a gangland film is the closest he could get to the Wild West. And the guns are blazing, the characters are spitting venom and the community is completely in a motion of terror. The title of the film is the name of Kowalski's (Eastwood) 1972 car, which his neighbours try to steal. Now, the film takes a bit of an ironic direction, something Eastwood is easily able to do. His Hmong next-doors are from the same origin as the Koreans he killed in the war, and they try to steal his car and end up being taken away by Hispanics and Kowalski saves the people who tried to steal from him. A review is not enough for this film. It is such a powerful and emotional film that 10/10 doesn't do it justice.",

For the longest time Walt's behaviour attests to an embittered human, content to snarl at what he views as profoundly obnoxious with the modern world, yet with no hope of being able to change a single thing. He can attempt to maintain his way of life - and does, such as when he hears noises from the garage holding his most coveted possession, or when he forces a youth-led melee off his property - but the years have not been kind in his attempts to encourage others to accept his way of life.

Disgruntled Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski played by director-actor the old school champion Client Eastwood sets out to reform his neighbor, a Hmong teenager who tried to steal Kowalski's prized possession: a 1972 Gran Torino. The plot is simple, narrative is straight, drama is deep, emotions are heavy, dialogs are witty and message is huge. All in all, from the word go, you are glued to last days of Walt and how he bonds with his Hmong neighbors and how it affects him and others. Clint Eastwood never misses a beat playing the on your face last man standing. His interactions with ladies around him are much funnier and deep than his main ally the Hmong teenager. The only false note in this class act is the ending of his interaction with young priest who is awaiting for Walt's confession for so long. Nevertheless, the out of the box climax leaves you so much to think about what you will do in similar situation. So watch it because it is witty, funny, emotional and quite a manly movie.",

I laughed, I cried, I got angry, almost every emotion!! It showed the truth (sadly) of some people out there but it also showed how people affect others and how goodness ultimately wins!! After the attack in the neighborhood, it made me realize what that family did for a lonely, sad, tortured soul!!!

But more than that the script is excellent Walt Kowalski is a dying breed, a Korean War vet who grew up in a politically incorrect era. His type is dying out and we may all be the worse for it. The best line of the film is when the young Sue thanks him for being good to her brother and compares him to her traditional father. When Walt tells her that he's traditional too, she says, "" But you're an American."" 'Being an American is unique. We have the freedom to speak freely whether we hurt feelings or not. That kind of language mutes hate and becomes bantering. Political correctness and multiculturalism is destroying what made this country great.

Direction was terrible, out of synch dialogue, and over used racism way too much. The writing was terrible, it was the ""writers"" first ""real script"" and didn't know anything about pacing and should quit writing. You will like this movie if you grew up in a middle America setting, with no ethnic diversity at all. This is the ""redneck/ war vet drama"" for the average American.(Or the redneck deer hunter(dumbed down, racist and has muscle cars)) Clint portrayed the closed minded, beer drinking, chain smoking vet, pretty well, but am not sure if he was acting, or just doing what he does. He tries to counterbalance the racism by adding the ""wigger"" character, but is ineffective and is just making fun of white people. This guy is getting too old and cant direct, and is taking on more than he can handle and it is showing.

618,10 July 2009,Jakealope,7, Solid Eastwood Work,"This movie was a good solid piece of Eastwood Americana. But it is a stretch to call it a masterpiece, as well intentioned and original as it is. Retired old Walt Kowalski is just a senior citizen version of the same old Clint. He's rude, obnoxious, bigoted, tough but deep inside a real heart of gold, right down to the spitting. His racial cracks, as crude as they are, are meant to show that he is someone who thinks little of every group of people starting with his kids, the Church to the rest of his dissolving blue collar community. ANd he is the tough, brave guy, the blue collar knight, just like Harry. So that gives him the authority to insult and talk down to everyone. The named car, a classic 72 Gran Torino GT muscle car, is like him, loud, tough but out of date. It is also a bit of a second lead given the average American guy's (& gal's) obsession with cars. If you watch the two behind the scenes takes on the DVD you see the makers were well aware of this and weren't shy about exploiting it. Okay, I won't go too far into the plot. The Hmong family next door has a teenager who is being bullied into joining a Hmong gang, led by his cousin. You can see that the surrounding blacks and Mexicans make life hot for the Asians so they adopt the gang mentality right down to the hopped up Hondas, rap and UZIs. Walt's wife dies, and he brushes off his sons and grandkids, who are all greedy and shallow we see. Then later the Hmong kid is pressured into stealing his prize Torino, is sopped by a gun wielding Clint but this leads to him getting closer to the Hmongs next door and being a dad to the would be fatherless thief, Trou. He initiates him into all sorts of manly stuff like fixing household items and how to talk trashy to the local Italian American barber. Then there is the young well meaning priest, who following his dead wife's last wishes, keeps an eye on him, giving Clint one more willing target of his withering abuse. Okay, without revealing more he has to confront the gang who won't let up on Trou and his adopted family next door. But there is always Harry Callahan, except with his trusty Korean War vintage .45 Colt and M1 rather than the .44 S&W. He does a lot of Clint stuff like whipping out his gun and punching out some bad guys and being the roughneck hero. The racial cursing are not over the top but they wear on me after a while, sometimes you wish for not political correctness but a little class and politeness. But it is always Callahan not Kowalski and you know him well from almost 50 years on screen. What redeemed the movie was the not predictable ending and the amateurish but cool pick up cast of real Hmongs. It had a good plot but in the end, it was Harry once again saving the day for us all weaker, PC, good for nothing pussies.",
619,28 May 2009,filmsploitation,9, Film of the year!,"Phil's Quick Capsule Review: By far Clint Eastwood's best film for ages, Gran Torino is charming, funny and at times shockingly violent. Eastwood bows out of acting with one of his most memorable recent performances that once again proves the Oscar voters known nothing. One of the films of the year. ",
620,18 December 2008,senioryangvang,8, themes of the film,Yes this movie deals with the Hmong and other races. first this movie introduces the Hmong community and some of its culture but Hmong people like all ethnicities including Caucasians can not be described by one view. for example the film describes Hmong as being shamanistic and animist but many Hmong are Christians also. it would not be fair to say all whites are white devils and catholic. of course this film draws out the stereotypes that many people have about Asian Americans as displayed by the jokes in the film. also the film talks about the stereotypical Caucasians that care about nothing but inheriting money and valuables. American materialism in short. their are different types of relationships that the Hmong people in the movie have with Clint Eastwood's character. the younger generation in the movie have a better relationship with Eastwood while the Hmong grandma despises Eastwood's character. and there is a good and debatable reason. in Hmong she says the whites came and lied to us and caused us to lose our homes and our way of life. it is true that during and after the Vietnam war the CIA did recruit and use Hmong soldiers to fight communism as stated in the film. the movie does deal with economic issues of race such as Tao believing that it is impossible for him to go to college and get a job. whether we believe this or not we cannot disagree that there are lingering traces of racism in America. the film does show that by getting to know each other we may not be so different yes different in religion and culture but not in humanity. if you did not know what Hmong is before this movie will give you a limited glimpse into the Hmong because no two hour movie will ever be enough to define any nationality or demographic.,
621,3 January 2010,wedelfamily,10, it should have won an Oscar,"Let me start off by saying that I am a huge Clint Eastwood fan, and have seen a ton of his movies. In the theater, i was really for another great movie. It started off a little slow, but it sped up after a while, and it turned out to be sad,exciting and even funny. I think it should have won an Oscar for acting and for the movie.This is definitely Clint Eastwoods best movie and deserves to win some awards. in the theater it got a standing ovation, and everyone in the theater walked out cheering. This movie should have won an Oscar and is one of my favorite movies of all time. DO NOT MISS, it is TOTALLY AWESOME",

Kowalski's two grown sons are in the congregation, along with his two spoiled, disrespectful grandchildren.

The promotions department - obviously fearing no one would want to watch Eastwood as grizzled grandfather to a young male Asian neighbour - instead touts this as Dirty Harry takes on the Crips, if you know what I mean. To a small extent that's true, but not the undercurrent. The girl who played Sue has a big future, what confidence on screen. Everyone has a father, uncle, granddad just like Eastwood in this role. And we all have our own prejudices against migrants - until we get to know them. Don't want to give too much more away - this is a must see. And ignore the nitpickers who want to find fault with minutiae in this film. When I put this up against 95% of what comes out of Hollywood, this film wins hands down every time.",
625,21 April 2009,eve_dolluk,9, A very good low budget film,"This is a very good low budget film and apparently the last we will see of Clint in an acting role ( he may have said that b4 though ). The idea behind the film is to show how people can change and that xenophobic views can be broken down with a bit of communication. The performance from Clint is not bad and quirky, many of the other cast are slightly wooden but they are also first timers in the acting business. The story is a good one and there is plenty of dry humour that made me laugh on many occasions. The film warmed my heart and i am glad i didn't miss it, I have watched it on a few occasions now also. Please be aware that there is an element of racist comment although it is not overly offensive people may feel uncomfortable. Without this element however the film would be lost, it is there to tell the story and attitude of the character, It is not there to insult any particular race. Other than that watch and enjoy. A brilliant story told well 9/10.",

Kowalsky is a Korean War vet with a natural xenophobia and several racial hang-ups, but with the natural goodness all men of integrity have. His character is truly believable. It is no surprise that the movie grows in you as the plot develops. There is a progression in his character occurring in a swift and unexpected direction. Kowalski goes from racial disdain and an equal opportunity hater, to a friend and a father figure for two young Hmong teenagers. He becomes a better friend and father to two total strangers than to his own sons and grandchildren. This flick is a must-see for every movie lover.",

For me, watching this movie was a choice between sitting at the airport or spending a few hours in the theater. I chose the theater and I will regret it for the rest of my life. The one redeeming factor of this movie is that it was in color. Come for the previews, leave. I can't believe movies like these are still made and praised as if people are honestly unaware that it's been made 100 times before. The only reason this movie gets one star is that IMDb does not allow negative ratings. I wish there was an undo for movies watched.",
628,1 March 2020,Dello_,9, Heartwarming and hopeful,"I've heard a lot of comments about how sad ""Gran Torino"" is and I disagree. Yes there is a sad factor but I felt more happiness than sadness during my watching of the movie. All the first part is full of black humor stuff and I laughed frequently but the movie is also able to make you empathise with the characters and makes you comprehend the stakes of the story. The second part is almost humor-less and is very emotional. I saw the ending coming since the beginning and I think the film isn't shy to suggest what will happen, because it's more interested in the how. And in the end yes there was some sadness, but the heartwarming side was a lot stronger. And I was happy because the consequences of the finale are positive and full of hope. I loved this movie exactly because of this sense of hope it's able to convey. Indeed it lets you remind that there are good people in the world and despite the existence of some cruel individuals there are also the ones able to care about the others and to be generous. I loved ""Gran Torino"", a great great movie by Clint Eastwood!",

It is hard to say it is the best because he is a Genius and filled with a tenacious spirit at his talents which are so broad. The closing Song He did, The demise of a former Mega City with the auto industry shutting down. The one thing I respect the most is he used actors and actresses in new positions and they pulled it off. For all the flack Clint received about racial divides portrayed in the film it was all jealousy and poppycock. He offered these young actors and actresses an opportunity of a life time. What would a retired Vet think of when he comes home to ruins. He did an incredible job and I cried through a lot of it with his ability to pull on emotional strings like sacrificing his life for a young man that ran with the wrong crowd. I can't say enough to give him but an A+ 20 points. Incredible film depicting reality in a city that has gone to be a ghost town just like the mining towns of America. Bravo Bravo",

From the minute it starts, it reels you in. I loved every minute of this soon to be classic. It's first off, hilarious. I wasn't the only one in the theater laughing either. Clint plays an awesome curmudgeon, one of the best I've seen. It makes you laugh, then shocks you, then possibly makes you cry your face off! I almost lost it. It's a tale about what people bring to other peoples' lives when they don't even intend it. It's a tale about great sacrifice and learning. It's about accepting people regardless of your own colored past. The characters are great, very creative. The side stories are present and interesting but not overwhelming as to take away from the main story. Superb acting by Eastwood and my only complaint is they could have worked a little better on the boy but he did a good job all around. I will watch this movie over and over again. I don't think I could rave more about it. Start to finish, one of the best movies I've seen in years (since Into the Wild or Lives of Others).",

Unfortunately, that's where all the good stuff ends. The movie doesn't have a proper form. The plot is row, superficial and without a real tension. After 15 minutes, you can pretty much guess the stroy's process. We hear about Walt's war time memories but the movie fails to take us deep into his emotions and relationships so his changing seems untouchable for audiences. Side characters are also poorly producted. I mean what the hell is it with that church dude or those gangsters anyway? The most noticeable disadvantage of this movie however is the acting. Everybody's performance except Mr. Eastwood is bad, especially the Asian boy. His acting is unacceptable. It's genuinely annoying and ridiculous.",
641,12 January 2009,fablesofthereconstru-1,10, Unforgiven redux,"The war comes home to roost for one man, a Korean War veteran, the man does what comes naturally to him when there's a conflict, in spite of his advanced age, he still maintains a soldier mentality and runs toward danger. Walt Kowalski(Clint Eastwood) is an evergreen soldier; the olive hue of his camouflage fatigues bled into his skin. Faced with an encounter among two Hmong clans, the third party picks a side, the lesser of two evils, just as he did in Korea, and performs his duty with emotional detachment. The Hmong gang-banger who harasses his cousin is analogous to the rogue soldier and the helpless citizen that pit Korea against Korea, a civil war of sorts, just like the one reprising itself in this Michigan ghetto. Although Walt remedies the crisis by defending the defenseless, it's strictly business with him; it's his job. After the gang-affiliated boys drive off, Walt tells his grateful neighbors to get off his lawn; they're no different from the gang-bangers, whom he issued the same directive, in the same admonishing tones. This objectivity is no mere act of humbleness; he wants this Hmong family on the other side of his property, or better yet, on the other side of the ocean.",

I was soon told by a few people that saw the film before me that the movie was not action packed at all and more focused on character development. With that in mind i went to see the movie. I'm glad that I was warned about the film because I don't think that I would have liked it. That said, I think the movie was well put together. You can watch the few main characters grow as the movie flows, and the story line kept your attention throughout. Some people might get offended by the racial comments said in the movie, but i thought that they came often enough that it felt as the comic relief of the film.",

Sure the actors are not the best you'll see in a movie, especially the kid, Thao, which somehow made me cringe a few times. This adds to the dialogue which could have been better, because yes, it was funny a few times, but I believe they could have changed something.

651,22 August 2020,shahrad,7, A modern western,"GT is a simple, emotional and captivating film. To me, Clint was not only trying to get past his Korean war memory as portrayed in the film but his actual Dirty Harry and Western past. The film does a bunch of homage to golden age of cinema where a tough loner takes on a journey to make things right, all by himself. Despite some poor dialogues and lack of chemistry among the protagonists, I found it very entertaining. It might not be among his best works (Mystic River is my favorite) but a notable one.

A superb piece of film-making. An artist at the very height of his powers, and with something very important to say.

Eastwood scores again in ""Gran Torino,"" a sort of ""Dirty Harry"" meets ""Grumpy Old Men."" Clint shows us again why he deserved the Irving Thalberg award. He is a true legend in the movie business. This tale presents Eastwood as a crusty, bigoted Korean War veteran whose weathered face hints at a world of horrors he has visited. He grudgingly befriends a Hmong family next door, taking an interest in them after his beloved wife dies. He has no warm fuzzies for most people - even his own family - but slowly develops a deep respect for this immigrant clan, realizing after several incidents in the neighborhood that they embody some of the human traits he holds dear: honor, justice and loyalty. ""Gran Torino"" is one of the best movies of 2008 and it's a travesty that it didn't even get a single Oscar nomination. Nevertheless, Clint proved once again that he can hold his own, whether as a 30-year-old gunslinger or a 78-year-old grandpa.",

659,19 December 2009,the-gossip-king,7, Clint Eastwood at his best,"I admire Clint Eastwood on many levels that are all on show in his latest work 'Gran Torino.' I admire firstly his acting which isn't a lot of growling but is the exterior of a bitter, old man who is a Korea war veteran and recent widower. There is much pain and guilt that isn't put out on display in the likes of actors desperate to win awards but subtly that is both humane, beautiful and believable. As a director I admire him most for his simplistic brilliance at storytelling. He occasionally experiments like with one averagely filmed montage in the middle of the film but i'm sure he can improve it. He doesn't call for mystery, the one time he did was the average but overrated 'Mystic River,' and as you watch his films you are immersed in the heartfelt stories he brings to audiences. With every film he directs an audience can feel his heart in the story. I also admire him as a film composer and song-writer along with his musically gifted son Kyle Eastwood. The song at the end, apart from the fact that he sung a little bit (sorry Clint your not that talented), is truly heartfelt and placed perfectly. If I had any problem it would be with the young Asian lead. I admire Clint Eastwood as a director for casting people who had never acted before in these roles but when he acted alongside in some scenes, he pales in comparison and sadly takes something away from some of the scenes. I also thought the ending was 'good.' I admire Eastwood for what he was trying to achieve with that ending and he succeeds on all levels but I think the films ending lacked the complete emotional knock-out that Million Dollar Baby did and while this films ending hits you in the chest somewhere near our dusty hearts that film hits you square in the gut.",
660,21 December 2008,wyattej2000,10, A Daring and Thoughtful Film,"I feel Clint Eastwood in many ways went way out on a limb in this film. First of all it is a thoughtful film. He is dealing with a clash of cultures, age, religion, and tradition. There are many themes being played out throughout this film and I think Eastwood handled them well. I mean, how many American released films are centered around the Hmong people? Like none. So, with that Eastwood was daring. Not only does he try to bring a group of people onto the screen who have been virtually ignored, he also takes off the kid gloves and makes the main character a partial antagonist. To those thinking about seeing the film let me warn you, the language is pretty rough for those with a thin skin. At times Eastwoods character made me uneasy with his outwardly racist comments, I guess that means Clint did a great job of acting. ",

I so looked forward to this movie after watching the previews but it is so bad! To sum it up quickly, old bigot Eastwood turns overnight into a guy who sacrifices himself to help his Asian neighbors. Gee what a great premise. And it has a horribly sappy Hollywood ending tossed in if that isn't bad enough. If you are looking for action, there are NO killings at all in the movie until the end which was very anti-climatic. Yes I know they call is a ""feel good movie"". Well I just wasted 2 hours of my life watching this trash and unless you love sappy, unrealistic movies with no action then stay far away from this drivel!!!",

666,21 March 2009,rmanory,8, A western without cowboys,"I would like to compare this movie to a totally different one, namely No Country for Old Men. Why do I compare these two? Mainly because of the upside-down ending. However, unlike in 'No Country', here the criminals do get caught. And this is an important difference. Walt is not a likable guy. He's very old fashioned and his racial views are disgusting at first. However, his was a 'harmless' racism. He does not want anything to do with his Chinese neighbors, and---as the ending shows---he's also no so trigger-happy either. Clint Eastwood is better here than in any of hid previous roles, and I am an Eastwood fan. He constructs a very believable character, a veteran who is disturbed by those who break the American values of ""live and let live."" He dislikes his neighbors because of their un-American behavior, but then observes that they are all-right, and they only mean well. He sees it as his duty to defend the American values, which include helping the weak and getting justice done. Going back to the comparison, both movies have the subject of good fighting evil. In 'No Country' however, the ending is disappointing. Here, despite the fact that Walt is killed, his scheme served its purpose and the criminals are caught, which makes it both realistic and dramatic and more satisfying than 'No Country'.",

Gran Torino is not on par with his other recent masterpieces like Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby or Changeling but it has heart. Clint as Walt Kowalski looks and acts like Dirty Harry in his golden days yelling at kids to get off his lawn, but with much more of a mean, bigoted streak. But, slowly he changes his ways thanks to a Hmong family that has moved in next door, being terrorized by a gang of Hmong thugs. He especially takes to Thao, their teenage son, whom he catches trying to steal his prized Gran Torino. Clint's character arcs in a positive way and although he maintains his racial epithets, we find they are terms of endearment. He uses them on everyone he knows. Clint's acting is sharp throughout the film, this isn't exactly a new character for him, only more seasoned and willingness to be open. A good metaphor for society in general. Not sure if the Hmong actors are new but they are rough around the edges. The best of the bunch is Sue (Ahney Her). Aside from predictable moments, it is a good film.",

If it wakes a tear from your eye, believe me, there is nothing that a bad camera angle, a bad script or the worst acted part can do to stop you from feeling. Movies like this are created for people to learn and FEEL, not to be criticized about how it could've been shorter... I feel to a point embarrassed of being able to speak a language which is the icon of 21st Century materialism and the comments for this movie are just filled with people trying to make a name for themselves, its OK, but at least if the comments were a bit more human rather than machine like.

The movie is about an old man who has an angry perspective to life. After he looses his wife, he starts to care about other people that he always hated. It is a very intense movie with very sad and silent moments. The story is well written and the character development is pretty good. Although the movie is around two hours, the time is used very wisely. The only thing I may criticize about the movie is the acting beside Eastwood. I didn't find the performance of Bee Vang so good.

Clint once again blows the competition away with such ease. I sat in the theater not knowing what to expect and found myself laughing so much at how awful Clint's character, Walt, treats every single person. Its not funny that he is awful but his ignorance and hilarious comments just make this movie a comedy for the first half. That was fantastic as I was not expecting this at all. The whole audience was laughing and getting into the film from the very beginning and it was so great to see. Suddenly, the movie slips some tender moments in and you begin to get those feelings you get in his movies like Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby. You realize that this whole film is evolving into a deeply emotional black hole that is sucking you right in. When the climax hits, it hits hard and it was amazing to see the audience go from laughing to complete silence in one second. This is one of if not the best Clint Eastwood performances of all time and as I may be sad to hear he may quit acting, it gives me joy to know that he will be leaving on such an amazing performance. The young man who plays Tao is quite a great actor at his young age and brings some of the best moments of the movie to the screen. Everyone should be on their way to ride this incredible roller coaster called ""Gran Torino"" and let the film take you where it wants. 10/10 100% the best Clint Eastwood performance!",

That was fitting for a movie whose main theme centers, way too obviously, on Christian redemption. Clint Eastwood plays a 70-something retired auto worker and Korean War veteran named Walt Kowalski who growls at much of the world. Literally. Kowalski loved his wife, but she has just died. He is contemptuous of the fresh-faced local priest who tries to minister to him and distant from his two sons and their families, and he derides his new Hmong neighbors -- Kowalski is said to be one of the last white residents of a changing working class Detroit neighborhood -- with racial epithets. Now living alone with his dog Daisey and several cases of Pabst beer, he defends his property, whose lawn he is shown repeatedly mowing, with his loaded Army rifle.

It was very clever to create a grumpy character who had to grunt his lines - saves on the voice! And yes, the stiffness of the junior leads was very uncomfortable to watch. It was like non-actors put in front of cameras for the first time - we've all seen it on SNL with non-actor-guests/hosts trying to get their lines out!

It would have been very easy to screw up this movie but Eastwood turns it into one more modest masterpiece. It's difficult to imagine anyone else playing his part and especially the comic aspect of it with the same dead on results. Having been an admirer of Mr Eastwood for most of my life I think his secret as a director might be that he has the attitude of a craftsman rather than an ""artist"". From what I've read about his on set tactics he seems to be relaxed and patient enough to wait for good things to happen and tasteful and experienced enough to recognize them when they do. This is definitely one of the movies he will be remembered for, both as an actor and a director. A couple of major awards would definitely be in order!",

He is definitely an accomplished director, but his performances in later films such as ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""The Bridges of Madison County"" have proved what a gifted actor he truly is.

I really enjoyed the subtle nuances of this movie and while it was a little predictable--I knew half an hour in that Eastwood would die and leave the car to the kid--I didn't anticipate the way it would end or Walt's final act, which was really great. Much has been made of the racist comments of this character, but I would pose the attitude that it is less important how you talk, than it is how you act. Walt may talk racist, but he's inherently not when it comes to judging people by their essence, as is shown by his championing of the Hmung family that he comes to know. I would also like to take issue with someone on this board who said it was unrealistic for Walt to suddenly stop to fix a rocking washing machine for the family he hardly knew. Actually, this is exactly what my father would have done, a man very similar in style and attitudes to WAlt Kowalski. It was like a compulsion for men of this generation--if they came across something broken, they would fix it. That was what being a man was all about in this generation. It's incredible to think this film was so overlooked at the Oscars. But maybe that's because there was actually very little violence and too much thought provoking action.

The script though is excellent and says all you need to say about modern society. ",

Sometimes critics need to look at a movies plot rather than focus on the subtle convoluted messages. This movie sensibly conveys a beautiful story of interaction and shows viewers that everyone has their own form of bigotry. What Eastwood knows and most of the viewers realized is that he accomplished more than to associate the plot with everyday interaction. Clint/Gran Torino accurately portrayed war veteran feelings and motives. Few movies accomplish this feat, Clint Eastwood spoke out for an entire age group and Veterans world wide. The charisma for one's country is very degenerative in some cases and inevitably causes life long prejudices. That being said, this story wont reach most of the said group's ears but to those that it does I am confident that it will have some impact. If Clint ever reads these reviews, I hope he knows that I and many of the other posters here believe he deserves the Academy award for best actor for this and all of his work. Overall 10/10 for character strength, emotional representation, and for having the courage to make a brilliant film without removing any of the reality-raw and like it is.",

I have only been to a handful of movies in my life in which there was applause at the end. This was one of them. I also found myself cheering for an acting performance that will remain historical. Mr. Eastwood's portrayal of Walt Kowalski is perfect in the way that he envelops the character, a character with flaws, inner turmoils, and ultimately a willingness to accept what he has always perceived as unacceptable. There are other good performances, but this is Clint Eastwood's movie. He is the focal point of every scene. He is at times very serious, at times very funny, but he is always believable. There are a few scenes where he could have rekindled Dirty Harry, but he didn't. Dirty Harry, also one of my favorites, was super-human, Walt Kowalski is human, with human characteristics. When Walt is a smart-ass, it is very funny, but we also see that turmoil that creates the behavior. Many out there will say that this is just a 78 year old actor trying to look tough one last time, but they would be missing the heart and soul of this performance. We see this toughness, but it, in no way diminishes the true depth of the character or Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the character.

And this multi-level facet of the story makes the movie powerful, emotional, and moving. So many films rely on big budgets, special effects, up-tempo pacing, and surprise endings as crutches.

At least that is what Mr. Kowalski, thinks how he will live out the rest of his days. Nothing could be further from reality, for Walt. When an Oriental family takes ownership of the house next door, Walt's life begins anew. To say that Mr. Kowalski, is set in his own ways, is to admit the obvious. A Korean War Veteran, this proud American, does not adapt to change very well, at all. This single factor, adapting, is the glue, which pulls this very funny film, together. The trailers, paint a very different image, for the movie viewing public. The trailers, make Mr. Kowalski out to be a very rude, violent, and closed individual. 90 percent of Gran Torino is a comedy. The jokes are all about humans and how to change and get along, no matter how different people are, on the outside. Mr. Eastwood, directed this coming of age film and how all of the characters in the film, no matter how old they are, can change. Sue Lor (Ahney Her) first approaches Mr. Kowalski, as one of his new neighbors, from the family next door. Sue, learns about Walt's loss of his wife, and shares similar feelings because she too, has just lost a loved one. Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang) the younger brother of Sue, is the focal point, of the film, because of the relationship which he develops with Walt. The Grand Torino, is a beautiful car, owned by Walt, when he worked on the line, at Ford Motor Company. The car also has a history but it is better that the film viewers, find that out for themselves. To comfort Walt, is the role of Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) but in time, the priest and the widower learn to stand tall. As I said earlier, everyone in this film, learns, how to change. This is a period film and the attention that is paid to the era from whence it comes, stays true. Maybe we all should take a drive in the Gran Torino, and change.",

747,28 October 2012,jrtrsq,1," One BIG Yawn - if you wasted your time too, at least warn others.","The majority of reviews seem to disagree with me, so maybe more people who think this film is ""awful"" should say so. I can't even think of another movie that is as boring. As an alumni of a liberal arts college (one of my majors was in literature and I also studied film) I think I recognize ""art"" when I see it. This was NOT ""art"" - not to me. It was one long, boring, yawn-fest. It was a huge disappointment because of the high ratings, and rave reviews, so I would appreciate anyone who agrees that it is an awful movie giving it a review. Most people only bother to write about films they enjoy. This is a film that more people who did not enjoy should take the time to warn others (even Clint Eastwood fans like myself) not to watch. Truly, saying anything about it, may be a ""spoiler"" because it lacks story, it lacks everything that makes a fine film except for good acting. But the best acting in the world cannot save a horrible waste of time, which sums up this movie. If you have seen the previews or a trailer, you have seen a ""spoiler"" and the best of the movie. If you want to bother with a couple of hours of waiting for those ""great artistic moments"" in the trailers for the film, then this movie is for you. Perhaps to the people who see art in squares of paint and call it ""abstract"", this is an artistic film. To me, it is pseudo-art at best, just a day in the life of a grumpy old bigot that lives in a bad part of town does not make ""art"" and that is all this film is made of, a boring story that could happen to anyone that lives in a bad part of any town. Feel like watching that - go ahead, but at least give it the review it deserves, even if you do love Clint Eastwood, I honestly don't see how anyone could feel the same about the movie. Maybe I am missing something - maybe for people who go to car shows, the Gran Torino itself is the art.",

It has been widely speculated that this will be his last movie but I can confirm now with the utmost certainty that this will not because there is no way in HELL Clint would allow his career to end with a ball of HORSESH*T as bad as this. I can't remember being more disappointed leaving a cinema. Maybe they were trying to resurrect a character Clint is no longer physically able to play. He just growled all the way through the movie. The movie starts with his wife's funeral and a catholic priest trying to fulfill the dying wish of Clint's wife of getting him to go to confession. You immediately know that by the end this will happen to give him his redemption. He then becomes acquainted with the neighbours, none of whom can act. One in particular, Sue Lor, was so annoying that when she was badly brutalized later it was impossible to feel bad. This is a bad telling of an old story about a grizzled old man whose heart is melted and who finds peace before dying. It has been told a hundred times before and each time better than this one.

A veteran from the Korean War, Walt, spends his days trying to prove to everyone that he's the most cynical person they've ever met. Set in a poor, crime infested neighbourhood, young Tao from next door is pressured into stealing Walt's prized possession, the Gran Torino, as a symbol of his loyalty to his gang member relatives. Upon failing, Tao returns to Walt's house offering his services as a handy man as punishment for his crime. As friendships develop between the two most unlikely of friends, Walt realized that he may just have more in common with his local Hmong neighbours than he originally thought. Clint Eastwood gives his all, as both director and actor, in this film as he strips away the romanticised idea of friendship to uncover it's raw beauty and emotion, one that comes with both joy and sacrifice.",

This movie like House of Sand and Fog indicates that white people are losing their property and homes to immigrants, who seem to win in the end!

I had heard that he was brilliant, but it wasn't until i saw Gran Torino that i fully understood. He blew me away, and so did the movie. I had no prior knowledge about the storyline beforehand; as far as i knew, it was based on car racing, like the video game Gran Turismo. I complied with the movie choice and went along. What i liked about this movie so much was that it was funny and centered around the theme of humanity. It focuses on Walt (Clint Eastwood), a disgruntled old Veteran, who has just lost his wife and is adjusting to the upsurge of multi-ethnic residents in his local community. As the movie unfolds, he becomes increasingly aware and learns about the cultural dynamics in his community. There are difficult/unpleasant moments of gang violence and cultural ignorance, but the relationships Walt forms with his next door neighbors (who are Hmong, an ethnic group in Southeast Asia) are really enjoyable and touching. How they confront the problems in their community is essentially what it's all about and it is a very emotional journey.",

Walt is at the start of the film is a grumpy stubborn old man who keeps a stiff upper lip who does in no way want to get involved with his neighbours but eventually forms a relationship with a Hmong family next door, i'm not going to reveal any more because it's best to go in without knowing too much. This film is a 10/10 and their are not many films I would give that high of a score. I know it sounds like a film you would catch on channel 5 on a Sunday afternoon (you would get that if you Live in England).

779,24 January 2009,Hoffmanpmj,7, No Country for Old Men? Yeah Right!,"Clint Eastwood responds to the Coen Brothers' No Country For Old Men with Gran Torino, a film that represents America's senior citizens' strike back. The aging movie star well into his 60's makes it very clear that this is HIS country, and he isn't about to let Koreans into it. Unlike William Butler Yeats (from whom the title ""No Country for Old Men"" comes), Eastwood refuses to go sailing to Byzantium to escape the hardships of being an old man in a young country full of gang bangers and quiet Asain boys. The movie makes No Country's Tommy Lee Jones look like a pussy; he cannot handle the new violence in America. Well Clint Eastwood certainly can; in fact, he's the one making the violence! GO CLINT! Old people still have their Gran Torinos and their rifles, and they're not afraid to take either out into the street for a joy ride.",
780,31 March 2009,delian-4,9, Is this Eastwood's best film?,"Despite a rather clumsy start this develops into an extremely well made and enjoyable film. Perhaps still in Dirty Harry mode Eastwood (director and actor)shows no subtlety with defining what we are watching in the first few minutes. His character, Harry Kowalski, is recently widowed, a racist, bigot, old-fashioned, doesn't get on with his offspring and frankly doesn't seem to have any discernible qualities. Like pouring petrol on a fire to get it started, once we've been over-stimulated with this information we are then treated to a slow burn, as Eastwood allows the film to progress at a wonderful steady pace. Kowalski's neighbours are Asian, indeed the whole neighbourhood appears to be foreign. Despite the efforts of his family Harry wants to stay put, displaying open bitterness to everyone. When a local gang targets his classic Gran Torino as an initiation act by his neighbours teenage son events are set in motion that will ultimately lead to the conclusion of the film. However, what separates this film from the 'norm' is that plot and character development are superbly handled, and are steered away from being too obvious on either score. Yes, Harry and his neighbours start to learn more about each other, but it never touches the point of being too schmaltzy. I think Harry is a good man, always probably has been, but like so many people in life, he is someone you have to get to know. Towards the end of the end I didn't want it to end. Like eating a really good meal, when you're down to those last few mouthfuls, I enjoyed this so much I just wanted it to go on. Eastwood has this film so much under control that the ending is not as predictable as you may imagine, yet still should bring a wry smile.",

Misfit, no nonsense cops, war veterans, bounty hunters and bare knuckle boxers are mashed together create one of Clint's best characters Walt Kowalski.Clint growls his way through the film playing the recently widowed Korean war Veteren who must contend with the local immigrant population. his own family have all but deserted the cantankerous old man, his only solace is found in his 1972 Gran Torino. After a a young Hmong boy , Thao tries to steal it he sets about trying to reform the boy, which leads to him becoming embroiled in the local imigrants problems with the neighbourhood gangs.

795,30 September 2009,gilgamesh-1985,10, In search of a perfect world: GRAN TORINO,"The old and rude Walt Kowalski, a veteran of the Korean War, has never stopped fighting. Lives permanently in the trench, against everything and everyone, friends and family. At the funeral of his wife listens quietly frantic chatter of her two children, or rebuked with steadfast gaze behavior brought his little nephew. Also responds poorly to a novice priest who, he said in a jurisdiction continues to preach the life and death: Yeah, what does he know of the death, so young and inexperienced in life? Walt lives in a suburban home, in a multi-ethnic neighborhood, surrounded by Asian neighbors who did not turn either one word or a gesture, but instead looks with contempt. The attempted theft of his prized model Ford Gran Torino in 1972, will trigger indelible impact. Now, regardless of any preamble, it should first be stated that films of Clint Eastwood is openly ideological and symbolic. It's inevitable. Which, for some, may be understood as synonymous with a political camp: and it is also true, it should be noted, than it is now well known to its republican militancy. But Clint Eastwood is far from being the spokesman of a reactionary right. With ""Gran Torino"", signed one of his works more morally and civilly committed. Complementary to his movies. In fact, Walt Kowalski is nothing but a like William Munny Unforgiven, he was never forgiven (by himself), he fights his demons, he continues to water down irretrievably in her painful memories of war and never forgotten, is waving the flag at stars and stripes, tries to mask his loneliness through the 'stubbornness in the eyes of others to enjoy. ""Gran Torino"" is the most striking example of contemporary western, where the yard of a home is a representation of a border to monitor and protect from enemies, no longer Indian but Chinese, blacks, Mexicans: the border as metaphor own territory, their land, but it is so unfair and wrong to enlarge their space? Observe closely with more empathy? Grant other but of course, remain themselves? This is the parable of existential Eastwood. There is no time for a 44 magnum, Inspector Callahan is tired of shooting, not that he lost his temper, who has just adapted to the times. The Justicialist is synonymous collective irresponsibility. Frustrates humanism. The myth of the superman does nothing but strengthen the incivility and ignorance. Discrimination against other races is simply the product of a culture of hate: one must first know in depth, since only the knowledge and understanding can fulfill a sense of loss of an entire nation. Walt Kowalski is a man alone, without anyone's friendship with a girl and her brother, an ethnic Hmong is flourishing in him a sense of belonging in fact, that seemed lost. It is visibly present in this magnificent character that figure of ""father missing"" that there was also Frankie Dunn in Million Dollar Baby, the closeness with another person ends up inevitably determine their own destiny, personal choices (the intense final scene, marked the rhythm of a duel western) arising from the feelings you have for another person, the right and wrong are very thin lines are often difficult to choose and go, and where there is life lies death. That Eastwood is an exhausting research in a perfect world, why is a film so profoundly ideological: his ideals, however, break the demystification of a country, America, your country, which has lost every shred of innocence, where even the relationship with God is made difficult and sometimes impossible. Very well acted, featuring a classic and impeccable direction, a photograph of a dry and beautiful, and enriched with a scathing humor and intelligent, ""Gran Torino"" is presented as an extraordinary moral fable, engaging and sincere: a masterpiece of form and content that has evaded any naively optimistic hopes in the final with a sense of hope, a message of justice, a call for tolerance. Someone can talk about rhetoric of anti rhetoric. Quintessence of thought Eastwood, instead: pure, ethical, tangible.",

""Gran Torino"" focuses on the forgiveness of one's sins as well learning to like what you once hated. The subject of ""life and death"" is brought up quite often, which becomes an intriguing topic. Although ""Torino"" is no where near ""Unforgiven,"" (my all-time favorite film)but it is up there. Then again, I love every Clint film. Don't let my opinions make this seem biased though.

Eastwood who also directed the film does a good job of pulling in emotional effect by maintaining Kowalski's grit and hardcore exterior while changing the hardness of his heart.

In doing this, Kowalski struggles with the social problems encountered by Thao and his sister, especially from an Asian gang.",
807,6 February 2009,southbase,7, Effective & timely if limited Eastwood drama,"Involving yet somewhat slender drama by Clint Eastwood, portraying an elderly Polish-American widower/Korean War vet/auto-industry retiree maintaining what's left of his decaying metropolitan household against the increasing incursions of gangland warfare and immigrant blight. As profanely verbose and insulated as he is leathery and gun-waving, Eastwood's Walt Kowalski has also managed to drive off what's left of his children and religious standing with his baby-faced priest (Christopher Carley), expending his remaining pungent life energies on his constant house/auto upkeep and warning off his Asian neighbors as trespassers. Yet when Walt's deepest bigoted fears occurs as one of the young neighbors is forced to participate in a gang initiation by breaking into Walt's backyard for thievery the event instead triggers shaky and harsh recriminations and explanations between Walt and the boy's family that soon become merely grudging and even welcoming, freeing the multi-generational Hmong family through their well-spoken daughter and interpreter Sue Lor (Ahney Her) to offer her brother as a laborer on any projects Walt needs to make up for the bad introduction. Through time and a lot of cooked food gifts and party invitations from his previously ignored and circumspect neighbors Walt begins viewing them as actual people with their own history of unfair treatment and cherished intra-cultural sustainments. Yet as Walt bears with a suspected terminal disease and trying to introduce the young man to a stronger view of himself through career and dating coaching, some of the local gangs become increasingly aggressive and offended by the increasing warmth and unity Walt's relenting have inspired, and when the group dealing with Sue Lor's brother make him a 'deal-with-us-or-pay"" offer Walt's smoldering and deadly protective instincts rebound against the gang into a shocking and potentially deadly confrontation. Reasurringly reflective and gently humored in its first 2/3rds Eastwood is generous and composed here, organizing Nick Schenck's script (from Schenk's outline with Dave Johansson) with its threadbare lower-middle class American flavor and hearty exchanges against the generationally-stacked, commemorative ideals of the Hmong enclave. The sequences are engaging and compelling throughout. Yet I found Kowalski himself ultimately harmless as a protagonist, not because he lacks adequate narrative drive (I've never seen a more powerful shot of Eastwood than when he points a gun right into the camera here) but his actual reach as a bigot is written off only with a line about ""I killed 13 men."", displaying nothing about if or when he willingly also 'killed' the efforts or opportunities of others unlike him to succeed and prosper alongside him at his jobs or within his community (while watching I could envision someone more along the lines of George C. Scott or Jack Nicholson equally understanding Kowalski but taking him into a more strategically-comical or unpredictable patterning). The film's visual technique, commencing with white-hot exteriors and comforted yet undimensionally-lit and spatial interiors soon becoming warmer yet hard-angled and shadowy, provides a highly immediate contrasting balance and suspense buildup of grit and sacrificial exchange that is belied by the earnest yet overly-coercive writing. GRAN TORINO therefore gives Eastwood--if not quite up to the achievements of UNFORGIVEN or MILLION DOLLAR BABY--and his surrounding cast of newcomers and reliable character actors a hard-hitting, eye-level contemporary canvas to explore what has been going on in America's post-Vietnam/post-Industrial era.",
808,9 January 2009,mm209604,6, Gran Torino,"First, before I say anything about this film, let me preface this review by letting anyone who reads this know that I watched an ""Award's Screener"" of Gran Torino and I did not see it in a movie theater (so I am unable to comment on the audience- which, I think often times can make/break a film going experience.) Gran Torino, Clint Eastwood's second film of 2008 (Changeling) can be seen as a culmination of his last decade of work. Eastwood, one of the few actors who actually might be a bigger draw behind the camera than in front of it, loves to tell the story of a man shaken by his past; a man whose faith in humanity and the divine has been uprooted through the harsh realities he has experienced (Unforgiven, Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby.) I see Gran Torino as a sort of ode to these films. Eastwood, the male lead, has channeled the characters in these films and ended up with Walt Kowalski; the Korean War vet who loves his lawn, hates his neighbors, and can't quite seem to reconcile his differences with the man upstairs. Sound familiar? For me, the film was more of the same; which don't get me wrong- I some the aforementioned films- but Gran Torino never settled in for me like Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby did. I was never able to relax and enjoy what I was watching on screen because it felt old and cliché.",
809,18 March 2009,hellfire_30,7, Clint's final role is unmissable,"Said to be Clint's final curtain in terms of acting - and also highlighting his talent and versatility yet again by a dual director capacity; Gran Torino has it's work cut out to live up to the pressures and expectation that come about when ever a man actively described as a 'living legend' decides to make a piece of cinema. Fittingly, for his last acting performance, he quite literally steals the spotlight from everyone else on screen. He emits such a strong and endearing presence, that the others are almost perhiperal - however this can in some way be attributed to his decision to recruit authentic ethnic actors and actresses to certain roles. Now, while I admire such a bold and realistic approach - the end result is a little hit and miss in places, with the obvious lack of acting experience shining through on occasion. This is one of very few problems, the other most prominent one being that certain concepts and ideas are conveyed so heavy handily that they lose there intended impact - the start of the film is where this is the most apparent. However, Clint's performance alone excuses these minor gripes; I yet again find myself complimenting his tour de force as a dis-enchanted cantankerous War Vet. It really is something special to behold. The plot grips, and turns down avenues that you would not ever expect, and the dialogue is sheer brilliance. Gran Torino is by and large hugely entertaining, and will genuinely keep you gripped throughout. Nothing more needs to be said about Clint's sublime role, which eclipses all others in its wake. A solid film that will hit all the right notes with fans and non-fans alike - only a lack of polish in a few places lets this down, and denys it truly great status.",

819,23 July 2010,asefkabir,9, A Movie about Courage and Integrity,"Gran Torino is another brilliant masterpiece by the veteran actor/director Clint Eastwood. I must admit that the movie had all the trademarks of a Clint Eastwood film, although within a different context. It's a movie about courage, integrity and bravery. Eastwood's familiar never-say-die attitude mingled with his stubborn fighting spirit portrayed a superbly round character of Mr. Kowalski, which none but Eastwood could depict with such perfection. The film is apparently characterized by evident elements of masculinity that we all expect from Eastwood's films. Fast action, manual labor, construction works, tools, gangs, guns and of course that old hard car Gran Torino that resiliently survived countless violent storms of time. Clint Eastwood's typical action styles were fabulous and it's good to see that even after so many years these trademark styles still entertain the audience. Eastwood's direction is praiseworthy because he has successfully been able to infuse his old styles and spirits into a fresh context, which has made it more appealing to a new set of audience.",

Th end of the film is so simple, yet so compelling- suffice to say it is beautiful. There is no un-justified action that most films suffer from, it makes sense and you feel everything the characters feel. The song that was made only added to the tone and felt perfect. Go in with a box of tissues, come out with half the box.
Easily my favorite movie of all time.",

I can't tell you how much I admire to the Clint Eastwood. He is a real living legend. Great actor and great director, and this film proofs both. He played so good, with his talking style, walking and spitting. He directed really good as well. Not much of a action but the story is really good that you won't get bored a second. At the moment I feel like I have to thank to this great man. Overall, I strongly suggest you to watch this film, if you didn't watch yet.

823,7 July 2009,shostachang,8, highest expectation,"The movie is structured as a delicate metaphor; the old car symbolizes the old man from various perspectives. Even though the car is kept in garage and cannot be used as anymore as an advanced, stylish vehicle, the prized possession still stands for the past glory and all the pride. In the last scene of the movie, Tao drives the Gran Torino bestowed by Walt and vanishes in the distance, which simply implies that when someone is getting old and is gradually stepping out of the dominant social life, he could still play a crucial role and drive the weak and the young on a reliable weaker into peace and safety. ",
824,24 June 2009,Veektarius,7," Good, but not Academy good","If you break down Gran Torino into its constituent parts, it doesn't look like much. Movies where a racist white guy learns to respect others are a dime a dozen (though most were written at least ten years ago). There's just something about the way it's done, however, that feels genuine instead of sanctimonious. Maybe it's the ""offensive"" banter or the attention to the details of Walt Kowalski's life and the lives of his Hmong neighbors. I found the ending to be a real surprise, too.",

This is as close to a perfect movie as i have seen. A story about life and death, friendship and sacrifice, it brings the mythical themes at the centre of so many Eastwood films to a kind of culmination in a working class suburban neighbourhood. And Eastwood's 'Walt Kowalski' is in many ways the culmination of all the great loner hero archetypal characters he has played. Everything in this movie is superb, the writing, the acting, the direction and the editing and pacing of the story. Not one scene is wasted. This movie will transport you with it's real life suspense, drama and comedy.",

The gangs are cartoon like.They make the grumbling curmudgeon look angelic by comparison.They too are heading for a fall. The kooky,cute girl wins him round and he saves her from the clutches of bad cousin.This will not end well.

The last time I had such emotions and feelings over a film was ten years ago watching American Beauty. Please note that is not a comparison to the film; but I've seen some great movies and loved them since then but it's been an honest ten years since I've had so much commanding respect and admiration over a film. Clint Eastwood has replaced my previous favorite actor/directors. Eastwood outshines many of the brightest in the business with his career.What a wonderful testament to his talent and ability to be this in his career and produce true diamonds of film. This is plain and simply the ticket to buy at Cinemas this weekend.You won't be disappointed; you will be entertained.,

I have been watching any movie that looked good. I have watched the godfather series and Shawshank redemption. They were great movies, but they don't hold a flame to Gran Torino. I have never watched a complete Eastwood film before, they never really kept my attention. I just got back from the theater and i could honestly go right back and watch it again and again. It is not a very Politically Correct movie, it is perfect for anyone that hates being controlled when it comes to speech. It is honestly impossible to describe the movie. One moment you are laughing the next crying, then the next your blood is pumping and you are ready for war. It should be the next movie you see.",
829,10 January 2009,liveaidrules,10, engine hums and bitter dreams grow heart locked in a Gran Torino,"Wow, I have never seen one actor absolutely carry a movie like Eastwood did in Gran Torino. As stated in previous reviews some of the supporting cast acting could use some polishing, but Eastwood performance makes up for what the others lacked. The film may be taken the wrong way as there are many racist remarks, but I assure you this is how many war vets speak. Eastwood deserves an Oscar for this performance because he completely embodies the character. The movie seemed headed towards Hollywood predictability, but the ending helped propel the film towards Oscar status. If you are thinking of seeing it, do it, don't hesitate because this film truly sparkles on the silver screen. Absolutely wonderful",
830,15 June 2009,JunKitatani,10, Old School America meets Modern America,"This film is poignant without corn/schmaltz; has social commentary without being too preachy; shows a strong leading hero without flashy stylized action; and is a simple, understated and beautiful reflection of dignity for both an American warrior in his golden years and the culture of his South East Asian neighbors. Not too much, not too little, and nicely balanced around Clint. Well, he is the man, isn't he?",

(How awesome if two MN'er won an Oscar back to back.) And I was not disappointed by this story, the attention to cultural details, and the epithet filled script - from which I appalled by more racial insults in an hour than I had forgotten in the last 10 years. The story of cultural and generational tensions in an old neighborhood being repopulated by Hmong immigrants is one that I have been witness to.

Being the director of this movie also tells why this movie was that good. It has a great plot not a lot of action(not needed)this movie has very good dialogues. Eastwood plays a greedy and in a way unfulfilled character but a very wise man who knows how to make himself understood. A war veteran which fought in Coreea he hated coreans. But a kid which was a neighbor changed his life in an unexpected way. It's a must see movie I think that this is one of the best movies of all time and it is one of my favorites that's why this movie is a plus 10 on my list,

It is beautiful and worth watching for anyone, especially fans of Clint. Don't pass it up! The newcomers in the movie acted with utter professionalism. And Clint delivered an Unforgiven for the modern age. I have to admit that though the Gran Torino has a part in the movie, I might have titled it something different. But it's Clint Eastwood. He could have called the movie ""Walt,"" or ""Wally,"" in deference to his character's name, and it would be the same: brilliant.

The acting is top notch throughout by everyone on screen and as serious as this film is it ihas some brilliant one liners which will have you laughing out loud. Eastwood plays a ex war veteran who's wife dies and he is left alone to cope with his Hmong neighbours. As racist and prejudiced as he is he comes to like and respect these people he used to kill in the war, and although he seems beyond his best in regards to his age he shows the Hmong gang bangers who is boss.

Also liked how they showed when a guy has a gun, numbers don't matter. There were few scene transactions that did felt out of place. And also the acting preist character was pretty out of place. If they used a older guy as the father, that would've made it not so awkward to watch. But My God, the ENDING!! The ending was unexpected and amazing!! Really liked it.

He never stops at testing human emotions to their core. He subjects his characters to such trying conditions that we wonder how would one react to all this by placing oneself. Such is the genius of Clint that he involves his audience in his films and this movie is no different. This movie most notably stands out because it is very realistic view of a disgruntled soldier. Clint plays this character beautifully. He gradual transformation is beautifully captured. His mentoring, his racism, his fearlessness, courage and atheism(which is beautifully captured with a touch of satire) ads spice to this already tasty cinematic experience. In all a cinematic achievement worth watching for years to come.",

Million Dollar Baby was amazing, and it truly touched me deep inside, but not as much as Gran Torino. The relationship between Walt Kowalski and Thao- and Sue Lor, the way he talks with his friends, the way he sticks to his principles and especially the way he acts around the priest made me laugh out loud lots of times.",
853,14 January 2009,mikey8567,10, Some thing worth watching by all!,"I have seen almost every Clint Eastwood movie from Dirty Harry to present. Clint has always been a strong actor in any part he has done, with it comes the great ability to surpass the mundane and bring into a film the thoughts a actions of the character he's playing. Everything from playing a cop, to a soldier, to now a person full of hate and loathing of other races. It seems fitting that a person of his era show that even things as strong as racism can be over come if your willing to try. Clint's acting in this part was superb, I don't think another actor could have pulled this off as well as he did. I would say this being one of probability his last few movies (hope he never stops) this is my all time favorite's of his. To those that didn't like it that's your opinion and your welcome to it.

Eastwood's the only 78 year old man I know that can still capture the screen so crisply after 50 something years of acting and 30 something years of directing under his belt. The film itself explores themes regarding racism, ageism, comradeship, and growing old with a haunted past. The story reinforces the importance of loving thy neighbor.

857,2 January 2010,oriexm,10, One masterpiece deserve 10 thousands of crap!,"First, I declared that I respect all the movies those are made with respect to movie no matter I call it ""masterpiece"" or ""crap"". Second, I do realized that different people have different views on same movie. Third, I believe the feeling of a movie is directly related to one's personal experience. The most difficult problem bothered me when I want to watch a movie is that, like Foresst Gump's momma always said, ""Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" You would never know a movie is good or bad unless you watched it. However, once you have watched a bad movie, you will feel like that you know there's maybe a bug in the hamburg, then you eat the hamburg and you found that you just swallowed a fly. Even there's plenty of movie reviewers,or movie critics. Not to speak of those dependent movie reviewer, who are paid to say good before a movie is released. Thus, every year I watched craps one after another, which drive me crazy and desperate. And many times, I tried to persuade myself to stop watching new movies since the bugs or the flies is definitely bad for health. I have never succeeded. Once I thought I am addicted to movie, like drug user or something. But then, I realized I am not an addict, I am a gold miner in a Gold Rush. The power drives me to watch movie continually is the possibility of an excellent movie, which is an gorgeous feast in comparison with hamburgs with flies. Those craps are fee payed to have an masterpiece, and an masterpiece cost a lot. ""Gran Torino"" is such an masterpiece, I am so disappointed that I missed it in 2008 during I'm stuffed with craps.

I try to make a point to see as many movies as I can in as wide of a variety as I can whenever I can and to be honest I've seen a lot of not so good movies, but every once in awhile a rare treat like this comes along.

The Man with No Name, Dirty Harry, an assortment of soldiers and convicts and eccentrics, and now, the bitter and isolated war veteran Kowalski, all seem to belong to the same mythology, a very compelling narrative about the limits of heroism, and our perception of the ideal man, the protector and the avenger.",
860,11 January 2009,MrOrange89,10, I can already say Gran Torino will go down in my book as one of the greatest films I've seen this year,"I'm going to admit it, I really wasn't expecting much from this movie. In fact, the only reason I wanted to see this it was that it starred my all time favorite bad ass actor, Clint. Once the movie was over, my only reaction was ""Wow!"". One of the main reasons why I give Gran Torino such praise is that it such a mixed bag. The humor was great because of it's political incorrectness - I swear to you right now that every single racial slur ever uttered in the history of the English language is spoken in this film. While it might sound very uncouth and tasteless, it's done in such a way where it becomes an important element to the film and the characters in it. For example, throughout the film Clint Eastwood's character is constantly trying to teach Thao, the kid he takes under his wing, how to become a man, and one way he teaches this is by taking him to a barbershop where him (Thao) and the barber are throwing racial names back and forth to each other. That particular lesson was about how to mingle with the guys and to test how far he could put the bond of friendship to the test. Another important element was how Eastwood's character would talk to the Hmong's. At first he refers to them as ""zipper heads"" and ""slopes"". But as he learns about their culture, he starts to treat them with respect. The symbolism in Gran Torino was absolutely fantastic as well. A good example of this are the two objects that are of great importance to Kowalski: His car and his gun. He values his car because it represents how hard he worked at a Ford factory, it was the one thing in his life that was pure and good. The gun represents the horrors of war that he himself has committed, it symbolizes his shame and regret, and feels it's baggage he has to carry for the rest of his life. I guess you could say that main theme of this film is the concept of life and death. The acting was great on everyone's part, especially on Eastwood's part. I was surprised to learn that the majority of the cast had little to no acting experience. Everyone managed to handle themselves very well next to the head honcho.",

870,14 April 2009,zlove-1,8, A grand farewell,"I thought the most crucial line in this film comes when the young Asian girl states 'because you're an American' to Walt. Walt, a little confused, asks 'Whats that supposed to mean?' Clint Eastwood is the American tough guy embodiment - in some ways, his big characters represent America, or a certain view of the ultimate American hero. Gran Torino celebrates, then kills this myth, something Eastwood seems to have been working towards for some time now. Gran Torino recasts a wizened version of the ultimate tough guy, brash, unyielding and racist, but places him in the world of today, which is the future of America. We still marvel at how damn cool Eastwood is when he brings the justice, but in this film, it is a joy to watch how he takes his own mythical qualities, built by Dirty Harry and the Man with No Name, and rewrites them. The film is complete with violent climax, which some have said was over the top, but which I believe is absolutely vital if the above reading of the film is taken, because of the way it flips the typical Eastwood bloodbath on its head, and symbolically, farewells this wiser version of the American Hero without compromising its air of greatness one bit.",

It has a good plot, a decent cast. The only complaint I have is the sound, from time to time, the scenes offer different background noises. Hard to explain, easy to notice. It's more so in the beginning of the film. I feel bad even having that complaint about the movie, that's how good it was. This is 2009's Dirty Harry. I don't want to spoil anything about the movie, but I do have to say, when you go to see this movie, think Dirty Harry with a 1911. Don't read any further than this for a review, because any details may ruin some of the epic scenes. Do yourself the favor, sneak in some Pabst Blue Ribbon and some beef jerky and enjoy this movie in the theater, don't wait for the DVD. This is a must see movie!",
872,12 May 2009,daugaard4-1,8," Fantastic film, but missing some ingredients...","This movie had, in my eyes, the potential to be a classic and in the top 100 films of all time but certain unlucky factors led it in the opposite direction. The old grumpy war veteran is a stereotype we can all relate to and I think no one could have played the part better than Clint. Simple things such as the way he moved and the way he looked at people were priceless. I felt early on that this was a character-changing-film, which is always tough because you constantly have to make the audience believe in the characters development. The contrast between Clint's family and the Chinese family was used in a very convincing way and I especially liked the way Sue was used in Clint's transformation. As mentioned this film could have been a timeless classic but there were things that I didn't like and things I felt missed. First of all there was the acting or failing of the same, led on by Tao, who didn't do a very good job. Also the tall black guy in the gang early on was horrible. But what this film lacked the most, was its failure to keep up the tension between Clint and the gang. Clearly Clint's last act of his life was to confront this group. Perhaps a scene where the Chinese gang threatens Tao on his life so that we, the viewers, understand that there is nothing standing in the way between Clint and the showdown. I rate this film 9 for the many details, the story telling, the compassion for Clint and the development of his character but only 6 for how the action unfolded.",

Out of all of the movies so far, this must be at the top of the list, if not for his directing skills, but his outstanding acting.",
874,18 January 2009,pimienta7,5, Dirty Harry meets...my dad...?!?!,"The two dominant characters in the movie are not the ""leads"" - but two of the side characters. Grandma (played by Chee Thao) and Daisy (Walt's dog - and only friend). Their roles are not insignificant, though they will be overlooked by most viewers and critics because their angles in the story are perhaps the most subtle of all of the characters.",
875,20 January 2009,jdesq,10, Outstanding,"I went into this movie rather reluctantly. It was my husband's turn to pick, and I do not like violent movies, which I thought this would be. I live in central California, which is home to a huge Hmong population. I deal with them on a daily basis with my job, and this movie gave me so much more insight into their culture. Walt Kowalski was a bigot, who uses so many racial epithets like they were common everyday things to say. But, in the end, he had a really big heart. You saw his character evolve, along with the character, Thao Lor, the young neighbor who tried to steal Walt's 1972 Gran Torino. I loved the movie and will be buying the DVD when it comes out. I think it is a good lesson on racial tolerance, and also, how not to return violence with violence.",
876,11 August 2009,globalmsg,5, The Polish view on this movie.,"Another American movie. Simple, slavish and idiot optimistic. Lots of prejudices about the Poles. Just keep your Chinese friends for yourself and plz don't mix any Polish Kowalski with you political preferences (we don't want any more Asian immigrants in here!). Guys, wake up, 6.5 million jobs lost in US since December. Stop making ""oh ah"" on this propaganda movie industry and do not waste so much natural resources when producing it! You wanna see some real heartbreaking stories? Go and buy some history books or read any Polish wartime writers. 20 millions Poles exterminated by Russians, 6 by Germans, and 40 brainwashed by Americans. Just keep on going, coca cola and good luck.",
877,11 January 2009,alwaysxclash,8, Diamond in the Rough,"First off, I have to say that I think I have been the youngest viewer to sit in every showing of Gran Torino. This disappoints me because I think that it is truly sad that a film like this cannot catch younger viewers who really need to witness a great film. However, I was never too surprised to see the absence of young audiences. After all, who wants to see a meaningful, touching film when there is My Bloody Valentine and Notorious. I digress.",
878,28 January 2009,auziearrow,10, Gran Torino,"Gran Torino was an excellent movie! just as other comments said it is a comedy and a drama at the same time. Clint Eastwood definitely directed this film excellently. at some parts, it was hilarious with Walt's funny crackled voice but at other times you just feel like shriveling up and crying. The ending is definitely an extremely powerful ending which shows the themes of peer pressure, devotion and sacrifice:P I'm not really good at themes:P.",
879,10 January 2009,Blaise_Tearson,9, Get Off My Lawn,"Clint Eastwood has done it again. The man is over 70 years old, and yet his skills in cinema never seem to wane. I went into Gran Torino with a full house, most of whom were expecting Dirty Harry to charge onto the screen, plowing people down left and right and showing youngin's what for.",
880,9 March 2009,arthurhu-1,10," Reverse Kung Fu Kid, Neighborhood missionary with rifle, Do the Right Thing","People really should support this movie which has a really big heart. It's too bad that Hollywood won't support a movie where a) the main characters are unknown Asians and b) the hero is a straight racist white military veteran. The movie starts by portraying the old Korean vet as a racist who is angry starting with his own family, and goes downhill from there, and the Asian neighbors as the enemy. The meek boy is the worst example of their people. But in the end, Walt is revealed to be the hero, and the boy becomes his spiritual disciple. As with the story of the good Samaritan, the ""invaders"" become his true family that he loves so much he gives up his own life for them. It's no coincidence that he ends up sprawled on the lawn as if nailed to a cross.",
