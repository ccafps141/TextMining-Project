0,6 August 2014,hitchcockthelegend,10, They said you were a giant. They said you can crush a man's skull with one hand.,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.",/

4,12 March 2022,Sleepin_Dragon,10, Spellbinding.,"One of the best films of a generation, it's a bold claim, but Gladiator truly is that good. Every single element is perfect, the story is phenomenal, one to absorb you for the full running time. The visuals are incredible, an epic masterpiece for the eyes as well as the soul.

5,21 August 2020,david-meldrum,8," 20 Years On, It Still Rewards And Grips","20 years on, the first DVD I bought is still a barnstorming, thrilling ride. There's so much to recommend this - Lisa Gerrard & Hans Zimmer's iconic score, the canny casting of Joaquin Phoenix as a foil for Crowe; the realisation that I quote this film in everyday conversation far more than I thought I did. If it should have won the Oscars is a moot point - this is another of Ridley Scott's superb worldbuilding - one of his primary film-making skills, giving us a Rome that feels recognisable yet still a break from the cliché's that had seeped in to popular culture before this. That the film's status was boosted by the DVD boom as it made its way to home release is undeniable, but this remains a film that thrills, absorbs and grips.",e
6,9 July 2017,jaredpahl,9," Both Old-Fashioned And Modern, Gladiator Is An Intoxicating Blend Of Action Spectacle and Intimate Drama","Gladiator, 2000's Best Picture winner, was undoubtedly one of the biggest successes of the decade. It made tons of box-office cash, nearly swept the Oscars, and revitalized the sword-and-sandals genre for years to come. Does the movie warrant the massive success it received? For the most part, yes. Ridley Scott's Roman blockbuster doesn't have quite the overwhelming emotion of another Oscar-winning epic, Braveheart, but as a brawny action spectacle, Gladiator soars. With a strong story, a profound sense of character, and action and special effects that are suitably exciting, Gladiator is a special kind of sword-and-sandals picture; One with a true dramatic core.",w
7,15 May 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Disturbing, but beautifully made and well acted, as well as jaw-dropping scenery!","Ridley Scott rarely disappoints with his films. All of them, including the unjustly-maligned Legend, are visually stunning and just show the director's artistic genius. Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he's done, if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic, making some scenes upsetting to watch, but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant, especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role, and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent. The costumes are brilliant, as well as the sets. In conclusion, Gladiator is a near masterpiece, only marred by some upsetting scenes. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",/

13,4 October 2020,bkoganbing,8, The Glory that was Rome was of another day,"35 years after Samuel Bronston and Anthony Mann gave us The Fall Of The Roman Empire, Ridley Scott told the same tale of the Emperor Commodus and
his problems succeeding his legendary father, Emperor/philosopher Marcus Aurelius. Neither film got the story right, both have him killing his father and
both have him with a hero/rival. In the Mann film it's Stephen Boyd in this film it is Russell Crowe. Both have a sister working against him Sophia Loren in the
Mann film and in the Ridley Scott film Connie Nielsen.",8
14,22 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,9, Epic spectacle,"An epic, awe-inspiring movie which thankfully shows us that Hollywood hasn't forgotten how to make good movies anymore, this is a film which has it all, from intrigue to suspense to violence to subtle romance. Forget any of the other CGI-laden rubbish filling out the multiplexes, this is a film which simply has to be seen at the cinema - or alternatively on a very big television screen indeed. Due to the fact that this film was hyped up incredibly, it doesn't actually live up to the hype, but nothing could have done. GLADIATOR is pure, old-fashioned escapism, nothing less.",3

16,6 June 2000,angelo-29,10, Breathtaking!,"Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well, you should see for yourself!",7
17,11 December 2020,ravenclaw_girlrules,10, The most perfect movie ever made,"Rewatched this movie today. I am convinced it is the most perfect movie ever made. It has a strong female character, positive and realistic minority rep (the Roman Empire extended into Africa and I think lots of people forget that), and a compelling revenge plot. Every line moves the plot forward and is memorable. The music is gorgeous. The acting is impeccable. The visuals are absolutely stunning - especially the rose petals raining down as the emperor is ascending on the platform. The visual of the emperor dead in the colosseum while the crowd lifts Maximus away. The whole concept of Elysium makes me cry every time. The ending couldn't have wrapped everything up better.",/

20,24 March 2002,sddavis63,7, A Very Good Movie That Could Have Been Even Better,"The beginning of ""Gladiator"" is powerful. We see the Roman Legion fighting against the Germanic tribes in what surely must be one of the most spectacular battle scenes ever filmed; one which truly does give the viewer a taste of what warfare in that era must have been like.

Its sweeping but simplistic heroic tale, crunching fight scenes, award-winning special effects, towering acting and soaring score set this film apart from all the pretenders that followed it. Ridley Scott single-handedly re-invented the epic genre with this story of a Roman solider who is betrayed, loses everything and is sold into slavery, only to fight his way back as a gladiator, all the while driven by vengeance for his murdered family.",_

A thrilling tale of a Roman general who must battle against all thinkable odds to avenge the death of his family and restore justice to the empire. The plot is simple, legendary general Maximus Decimus Meridius, after many victorious campaigns and battles wants to return to his peaceful home in Spain, However the kind, fair and dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius wishes to bestow his title on him over his cruel son, Commodus. Commodus is understandably annoyed and kills his father calming the title of Emperor. Maximus is sentenced to death along with the rest of his family back at his home in Spain. Maximus escapes but is unable to save his wife and son. His loss of will to live makes him an east target for slavers and he is soon sold as a gladiator.

29,2 February 2001,shahrad,5, What do you expect?,"Gladiator is one of those movies that  tries to present a splendid old story with today standards of film making so younger persons of our time could be impressed by that too. well, what do you expect? Gladiator tries to be(or imitate) something like Ben Hur and Spartacus but fails in many ways. I agree that the visual effects are amazing, but the score is not a masterpiece and the most important thing-in my idea-the screenplay is too ordinary and has nothing particular and new to present. It seems that the real point of killing Maximus is to make audiences cry.( I couldn't find any other reason to get him killed). But, in some ways the movie is worth watching. I claim that I bought the tape of the movie, because I felt that my library needed it.",v

The opening Battle Scene simply mesmerizes, showing the brutal nature of combat for Roman conquests.  I went back to see the film again.  The first time I didn't hear anything Crowe said before the battle.  I was just too visually caught-up.  The second time I listened very closely and caught the wise yet succinct line from Maximus ""what we do in life... echoes in eternity.""  Awesome.",
33,21 July 2020,drqshadow-reviews,10," Ridley Scott's Ancient Revenge Fantasy is a Burner, Through and Through","A number of giant, career-making performances (plus another impressive turn in the director's chair for Ridley Scott) fuel this rich, hard-hitting saga of betrayal, grief and revenge in imperial Rome. The dueling fates of Maximus (Russell Crowe) and Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) share the front and center, twin note-perfect parts that continuously clash over the spotlight, but dozens of supporting players also deserve recognition. Richard Harris as the guilt-ridden sage, Marcus Aurelius. Oliver Reed chewing scenery as a grizzled, cynical combatant-turned-slaver. Djimon Hounsou and Ralf Moeller, comrades in arms who convey an intimate, crucial sense of kinship. As an intensely emotion-driven story, Gladiator can't function without this level of acting power. In less capable hands, it might be laughed off the screen. With Crowe, Phoenix and company in command - and, again, Scott there to expertly piece it all together amid an appropriately epic score by Hans Zimmer - we're swept off our feet.",
34,29 March 2002,cutter-12,7, Adequate Roman Epic,"There is much to appreciate about about this picture but at the same time there is much to castigate as well. What could have been a thoroughly involving story turns out to be crippled by a lean script, some very indecisive direction and choppy editing. Not to mention some bad casting in the form of Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, a role which cries out to have been the last role played by Anthony Quinn.",

I thought they were being unnecessarily 'Roman' in their ruthlessness, but the result does show how disappointed so many viewers were and the extent to which this movie has polarised opinion.",
38,30 August 2021,PyroSikTh,9, Still Amazing Twenty Years Later,"Gladiator deserves every ounce of praise it got at the time (and debatably deserved more), and still gets to this day. It's a stirring story of revenge against the backdrop of Roman glory, with a game played off between the stoicism of Maximus against the cruel envy of Commodus over the people's adoration. It becomes as much about the back-alley politicking and public perceptions as it does the fights within the arena itself. Maximus is the pinnacle of masculinity and heroism against Commodus' despicable antagonist, an underdog against powers greater than himself. And when Maximus gets his revenge and collapses on the floor to meet his wife and son in the afterlife, it hits with the emotional weight it has earned. It's beautiful to look at, gorgeous to listen to, expertly directed and edited. I give Gladiator a resounding 9/10.",

Maximus is expelled from the army, his family is killed, and he ultimately ends up in Rome as a gladiator for Proximo (Oliver Reed). Defying the will of the Emperor and eager to have his revenge, Maximus becomes a hero to the masses and joins Commodus's sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and a cabal of Senators led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) in an attempt to bring down Commodus.",
40,14 May 2010,Jetset971,7, Good summer movie but Oscar worthy?,"I have had a great deal of discussions with people about this film. I agree it is a good movie. Its entertaining, action packed, worth the price of a ticket. However, I don't think I have ever seen a movie win so many awards without questioning the validity. Gladiator, while still a good film, is hardly deserving of all its accolades. I mean it might be worthy of winning cinematography or production awards or special effects but Best picture? Best Actor? I could think of a 100 other movies in the year 2000 more deserving than this movie. Don't misunderstand, I like this movie, but the problem is that movie awards like the Oscars,presumably, are there to honor high quality and High achievements in each respected field. Russel Crowe does an adequate job, but his acting in his other Oscar nominated films like ""The Informant"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"" were light years ahead of his performance in ""Gladiator"". Furthermore, Giving best picture to this film was mind boggling. I personally feel that the only reason this movie was even in the running at all, was because of the money it made. It was a good action movie and nothing more. Hey, remember that ""Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was also up for best picture that year. In my opinion, It ran circles around ""Gladiator"". Wheras ""Gladiator' was just a good action film. CTHD was a phenomenal action movie and love story and should have won the top prize.",

42,20 June 2020,ylshu-06641,9, Gladiator,"What really touched me was not its luxurious production level, exquisite historical props, simple costume design, textured photography, or a strong sense of war scene. What really touched me was the moment when he touched the wheat waves dancing with the wind, looked at the blue gray sky in the distance, and slowly set foot on the way home under the eyes of his wife and children. For me, those excellent productions are only the surface, and the scene of the warrior coming home is the real soul of the film.",
43,23 October 2001,Hitchcoc,7, Predictable Spectacle,"I never got around to seeing this in the theater. I'm sure it's a marvelous spectacle on the big screen. I don't know what it was. I found the acting good, the spectacle and special effects outstanding, the hero one we could cheer for. Why, then, do I feel so empty? Was it all the hype, best picture of the year? I just don't know. It was totally predictable. There were absolutely no surprises. After seeing The Patriot and realizing both movies have the same plot, I expected something more. Why are evil Roman Emperors always portrayed as cowardly wimps? I still don't believe that he actually was willing to go into the arena with Maximus. He wouldn't have anything to do with war. There is the obligatory killing of the family. That goes back to Macbeth folks. If a ruler wants to stay a ruler, leave the family alone. I know it's just to show how evil and powerful the Emperor is, but do you want the top general in the army gunning for you?--this will guarantee it. There is masterful cinematography in this film. The scenes of violence are masterful. Although once you've seen one fountain of blood spouting up, you've seen them all--one decapitation is like another. What I wanted was to see the characters really dealing with the evil of the times and confronting it. There is always that army out there ready to be commanded again. There is always the possibility that the greatest empire in the world can be destroyed by one guy (like when Mel Gibson won the Revolutionary War all by himself). I think this is really quite a good film. But I don't see it as deserving to be named the best of any year. We've come to demand a movie that looks good rather than one that grasps our heart.",
44,12 February 2012,planktonrules,8, Amazing and a bit disappointing.,"Visually, ""Gladiator"" is a masterpiece. I saw a documentary about how they made this film long before I saw the actual movie and it's amazing to see how they used CGI to construct an enormous FULL stadium even though most of it wasn't real! The costumes, props, chariots and trappings were also gorgeous--as good as anything you'll ever see in a film about ancient Rome. And, with some spectacular stunts and TONS of blood, it is brutal--but spectacularly brutal. You really have to see this film and it will knock your socks off.",

Yes, Gladiator will probably win the Oscar of Best Picture of 2000, but should it?  While I agree that watching it was a great pleasure, I am not convinced that it was the best movie made last year.

52,22 November 2010,mjneu59,3, Ridley Scott's artificial epic isn't very impressive,"Ridley Scott's Oscar-winning ersatz epic is one of the least spectacular big-screen spectacles ever sold to an undemanding public: a sand-and-sandal throwback stripped of the genre's all too necessary guilty pleasures. The idea was to recreate for today's digital generation a wide-screen Roman Empire costume drama from Hollywood's pre-video adolescence, but all the fancy computer imagery (and state-of-the-art budget) only makes the new film look and sound more solemn and pompous than its beefcake role models. Worse yet, the occasional token nod toward old-fashioned visual grandeur isn't enough to camouflage the claustrophobic TV screen compositions and typically frantic Madison Avenue editing job (designed, perhaps, to hide the digital wrinkles).",

61,13 December 2004,Krippler,6, Didn't deserve the Oscar...Doesn't deserve Top 250.,"There's really nothing spectacular about ""Gladiator"". The acting is stiff because of the boring and sometimes non-sensible script. Ridley Scott's direction is choppy and forced. It reminded me more of one of his brother's movies. I love Russell Crowe but the fact that he won Best Actor for this and not for ""The Insider"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"" just doesn't make sense. To me he just seems bored in some scenes. I wonder if the Oscar voters watched any of the other films from that year because this sure wasn't better than ""Traffic"". Of the 2 and a half hours running time, there are really only 30-40 minutes of excitement. The rest is average at best and the ending is just ridiculous. THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC. ""Gladiator"" is a good film but does not deserve the praise that it is given by most on this site. I give it a 6 now but my opinion for this film drops every time I watch it.",

Joaquin Phoenix gives a magnificent performance, camp in the best swords and sandals tradition, throwing childish fits when he doesn't get his way, sporting marvellously gothic eyeliner (Romans vs Goths, you see), scheming elaborate punishments for his big sister, which, for him, unlike the rest of us, who get our hair pulled, can actually, horribly, be realised.",

The characters are quite as flat as they are on Star Wars 1 2 and 3. Even cinematography makes you squirm. Zoom in on a actor while he is monologuing?

Commodus has other ideas: he murders his father and orders Maximus to be executed. Maximus, not one to give up quietly, makes a daring escape, and, badly wounded, heads for home, where he discovers that his wife and son have been crucified on Commodus' orders. Passing out from the pain of his injury, Maximus is captured by slavers, nursed back to health and forced to fight as a gladiator. This new life eventually leads him to the Colosseum of Rome, where he finally comes face to face with the man who betrayed him.",

I never expected to ever see another Roman epic, but Ridley Scott has proved it is possible. What's so great about this movie is that it has a really entertaining and enthralling storyline, not just special effects and action (although it has a lot of that): it knows how to make us care about the people in it and how to develop a sense of style and elegance (thanks to director Ridley Scott). The movie is fueled by a number of powerhouse performances: Russell Crowe is perfect as the title character, I loved Oliver Reed as Proximo, and Joaquin Phoenix made a perfectly hissable villain. I was amazed at how exciting this movie was. Although the opening battle sequence is not very promising, with its confusing, chaotic editing, after that it's just uphill: the film will send you on roller-coaster ride of nonstop thrills. The effects are very well done: there is a scene where we see Commodus arrive at Rome as the new emperor that's absolutely breathtaking. I also loved the way they recreated the Colosseum. Parts of this movie are truly awe-ispiring. The fights in the arenas are spectacularly sensational. I must also mention John Mathieson's absolutely beautiful cinematography and Hans Zimmer's perfect music score. Some scenes where Mathieson's visuals and Zimmer's music mix are undescribably beautiful and breathtaking.

It is not much more than a combination of Braveheart and Last of the Mohicans, go to Rome -- to name a couple of more recent films. In effect, it is hero gets done wrong and his loved ones are killed, so he bides his time and gets his revenge. I think all of the hurrah behind this film is from Hollywood having little else to offer this year at the Oscars (how else could Chocolat get nominated --$$$).

The camera-work in the first battle scene is disorienting and intentionally blurry to avoid showing anything in detail.  The dialogue, from start to finish, is unrealistic- both on a human level and a Roman level.  If you want to incorporate historical figures into a fictionalized account, treat them as historical figures, not perversions of historical figures with the same names.  Marcus Aurelius was not a 2000 year-too-early Thomas Jefferson. Whatever Hellenistic notions of democracy the Greeks held to, the Romans repudiated until the disintegration of their empire.  I laughed awkwardly (to mask my offense and disbelief) when Aurelius lets his daughter know what an impressive ""Caesar she would have made had she been born a man.""  What utter nonsense!  Furthermore, the character of Commodus is not so much miscast as it is botched in the person of Joaquin Phoenix.  Russell Crowe acquits himself nicely in his performance as Maximus, but is his story of revenge really that sympathetic?    The computer generated Rome is impressive, but not even on a par with the Rome of Julie Taymor's recent ""Titus.""  And what is this odd, recurring cornball shot of Maximus parallel to the ground as the grass moves under him?

Now that's guilty pleasure. Definitely a guy movie, as men outnumbered women three to one in audience. Star Wars, popular as it was, made the mistake of actually being about something; I'm happy to say that Gladiator has no redeeming value whatever. Just blood, mud and crud. Some of the killing made me laugh out loud, like when Crowe stabbed a guy with two swords and then chopped off his head while he was still standing. When Oliver Reed went into that monologue, accompanied by full orchestra, about the thrill of the cheering crowd I almost thought he was going to sing There's No Business Like Show Business. You know something is a bit over the top when one of the most restrained performances comes from Richard Harris! Another big laugh was when Crowe and Djimon win the crowd over by becoming the first ""tag team"" gladiators in pre-television history. Film pictures all the gladiators as united against some unnamed enemy over on the other side of the arena, thus daintily skirting the more Spartacus-like reality that the gladiators fought and killed each other -- and therefore, presumably, were hard put to have indulged themselves in the kind of emotional ties we see here. When the leading lady (Connie Nielsen, in fact just about the only woman) arranges to meet Crowe privately, she explains for the audience's sake that patrician women purchased sexual favors this way all the time. Seems to me everybody onscreen would know that already! It's like in The Mikado where Yum Yum turns halfway toward the audience and says to Nanky Poo ""But darling, you forget: in Japan..."" except that in the latter case WS Gilbert meant it as a joke. ",

122,8 June 2015,anaconda-40658,4, Repetitious Crap.,"Gladiator (2000): Dir: Ridley Scott / Cast: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, Oliver Reed: Visually stunning depiction starring Russell Crowe as a gladiator whose life is marked by violence in an ugly fashion of sport. He is framed for murder and sentenced to death but he survives only to discover that his wife and son were crucified and burned. Central plot thrusts him in gladiator games where he spends wasted time hacking up soldiers. Triumphant art direction cannot save repetitious story. Director Ridley Scott successfully creates the era but this is hardly a match for his superior films such as Alien and Blade Runner. Crowe carries the film going from honoured soldier to a fighter placed within a bloody game of survival where only his revenge drives him. Joaquin Phoenix overacts tremendously as Caesar who is basically a cardboard villain destine for death and when it happens, it lacks the intended satisfaction. Wasted appearances by Connie Nielsen and Richard Harris. Oliver Reed even appears as an old gladiator who likely wiped his ass with toilet paper that contained more than what this screenplay does. The art direction and visual elements are in top form. The film reflects the Roman Empire and violent sport to entertain the lust for violence.

123,20 January 2002,ranev,7, What a sad waste,"It's starts out like any good epic should with a masterfully filmed and executed exciting battle sequence that sets up the audience for one of those rare Hollywoodian confections that are both entertaining and artsy. Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there. It isn't the performers faults since every single one of them give amazing, emotional, even, at times, riveting performances (the kinds you should find in better movies) and who give the whole picture more class than it deserves. It isn't Hanz Zimmer's nor Lisa Gerrard's fault since they have composed a score that's almost (and I do mean almost) as unforgettable as the Godfather's. And it certainly isn't Ridely Scott's fault since he yet again succeeds in immersing the audience in the world he has created. No, the ones who are to blame are the people who wrote the saccharine, clichéd, soap-opery script and who, in the process, have wasted all of this incredible talent. They should be fed to the lions. It's an entertaining B-movie that could have been a classic. Just like Titanic in a way.",

Russell Crowe is one bad a**  MF that kicks major b*tt.  Not to mention he looks so hot as he is decapitating and slashing the competition.  But what makes this movie great is the story line is heart felt and you feel for Maximus after his family is murdered. It is the ultimate tale of revenge.,

Ridley Scott taking on something much grander than anything he had previously. A cast of fine actors led by Russell Crowe. A return to the sword-and- sandal epics of years gone by. It's a film of fine visual finesse, engaging action sequences and large themes. So why is it that Gladiator left me feeling so cold?

Thus making him a gladiator. This original and breathtaking story is a masterpiece for many reasons: it's script, Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix give the performance of their lives. The score composed by Hans Zimmer and the action sequences in the arena. This is one of the best films happening in the times of the Roman empire and as said before, it is a masterpiece. The most memorable scene is of course when Maximus reveals himself towards Commodus and says he will have his revenge. Hands down the best scene and my favorite one.",

Movie audiences have long awaited a film which mixes history and action in such a way that it becomes memorable. Ridley Scott has become a true artist in his conception of action films. To date, few films have become so notable as this rendition of the last years of the Emperorer Marcus Aurelius( Richard Harris) on the Rhine. In this story we have a veteran Roman General (Russell Crowe) Maximus Meridius who having won yet another victory over the Germanic tribes, wishes nothing more than to go home and tend his crops. he asks his emperor for permission to go home, but before the wish is granted, he dies and his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) becomes the new ruler. Fearing the popular general is a threat to him, he orders him killed. Oliver Reed (In his last film) plays Proximo, an owner of slaves and gladiators saves him and offers him a chance for revenge. Derek Jacobi plays Gracchus who lends a splendid dignity to the film. Spencer Treat Clark is Lucius who finds the Spanish Gladiator admirable, courageous and interesting. Throughout the movies, one cannot but enjoy the settings, the costumes and the various sub-topics which make for drama at it's best. Highly recommended, this film is sure to become a Classic. ****",

133,9 June 2006,bbhlthph,1, A film that opens the floodgates to what?,"'Gladiator' received numerous awards and has attracted over 2000 largely favourable user comments on IMDb. Although my comments will not be well received by those who regard it as a great film, I believe this is an APPALLING film which should never have been released. A film can be appalling because of bad direction, bad acting, or just plain bad photography - none of these are the problem here. A film can also be appalling because it plagiarises an earlier film too closely without giving any recognition to it, because it is intellectually dishonest, because its contents are antisocial, or because its nature is such that it is highly prejudicial to the film industry as a whole - the last three of these concerns all seem to me to arise with Gladiator. Some IMDb users have expressed concerns about plagiarism - noting its very close structural similarities to 'Braveheart' (1995) and 'Tarkan' (1969), but these are not my concern. When the scenario of a new film is totally different to its predecessor it is hard to justify condemning it for plagiarism.",

Other than that, however, I think the overall style of the film and the film-making itself are already quite badly dated and forgettable. It doesn't feel like the personal vision of a talented filmmaker (Ridley Scott in this case) but more like an anonymous miniseries with great actors and a very big budget.

The movie has such great shots, that you will be truly impressed. There wasn't any saving made by the producers with the staging of the scenery. It has been set to resemble perfectly the Roman times. The fighting scenes in the gladiator's arena are shocking, but tastefully done. Actually, the movie begins with a battle between a Roman legion and a German tribe's army. Great shots! It is much better than the fights in Braveheart. The other impressive side of the movie is the consistency of the plot. The movie has a coherent plot which sends us a clear picture of the happenings, without limiting the suspension. You cannot guess the end of the movie at all, and neither the next step, but as it happens it is logic. The last but not least is Crowe's acting. I have never heard about this actor until this movie, but he plays very well. He is manly and sensitive altogether. I commend its casting, when other candidates were more known.

The first third of the movie was tedious - the one battle at the beginning was so messy you couldn't tell what the hell was going on -- ok the horrors of war show that it's crazy and Ridley Scott was trying to make the viewer feel as disoriented as the film's hero -- guess what? It was done better in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and at least in that film you can SEE the fellow soldiers falling around the main character. One ripoff from a film. Also check out how close it comes to ""Braveheart"" in parts --- ""Say, William Wallace is visited by the young queen while in a cell in ""Braveheart"" and that was cool - let's have Maximus visted by the daughter of the king and conspire against her brother just like the young French Queen conspired against King Longshanks in ""Braveheart."" Plus in ""Braveheart"" there's cool battle scenes, let's try that too. Not to mention the obvious, Russell Crowe sure as hell sounds like Mel Gibson, the only difference is he is so miserable in this film and there is no real heroic character development like with Gibson. When his family is killed at the end of the first act, the moral is that Hollywood truism, ""behind every good man is a dead woman and/or child."" It does pick up after that though. The best part in the film was the 2nd act after he's picked up by Oliver Reed and thrown in as a Gladiator - but even here the battle scenes are too messy and you can't tell what the hell is going on - at one point a Legionaire is cut in half by what I thought was only a wooden stick on the chariot - I had to be explained that ""it must've been a blade"" by my companion who came with me to the film. Now that I think about it, we were asking each other what the hell was going on a number of times, mostly due to the jerky camera shots and the loud noises over whispered dialogue. And I never talk during a film. The ending was ludicrous the ""go home Maximus"" and the ""Lucius is safe"" dialogue made me roll my eyes. There was little to no historical value to the film and Rome was pretty damn boring - plus 5 shots of the same part of the ""majestic collosium"" only verified that it was a CGI-generated shot.

Instead, it easily surmounts them, drawing the viewer in, and forcing out of them every possible emotion by it's sheer power. We can't help but cheer when Maximus strikes down yet another foe in the arena, we can't help but boo and groan with malcontent as the purely evil Commodus (there's no other way to put it) plans his next scheme. Gladiator manipulates our emotions in a way that is fantastic to behold - Hans Zimmer's beautiful and majestic score keeps the mood flowing, and the simple story is brought up by the sheer scope of the production and the incredible performances driving the film.",

I firmly believe that it is filmed ""shaky"" to convey the confusion and madness in a battle, and not because the guy behind the camera didn't know how to use one. Yes, it contains blood and gore and all that jazz, but do not forget it's a movie about gladiators. Gladiators back then did not sit around, drinking tea and eating sandwiches; they did almost exactly what was depicted in the fights scenes in the film. How else were the film-makers to portray the violence of gladiator fights than to include it in the movie?",

I'm sitting here staring at the glowing Entertaintment Weekly review and I just cant believe it. Other reviews for the most part are just as good. Did everybody else go to a different movie then I did? Did they not see an overlong bore? Did they not see the maybe 2 or so facial expressions Russel Crowe used in the movie that is supposed to be good acting? Did they not see the action scenes that were put in fast motion and slow motion that were completely unneeded, unartistic, and unoriginal? I wonder if Ridley Scott could have ripped off Spielberg a little more? And the dialogue! Did I hear the young emperor say, ""Im very vexed, terrible vexed!"" I laughed out loud. Was that supposed to be that funny? Or was that just horrifically bad writing? And how about those lovely computer generated lions? Complete trash. How can you people be giving this movie 10's and sending it into the top 100 already. Let there be a backlash please. Movies this bad deserve one.",
181,28 October 2005,oli_rawlings,10, consistently indescribably superb,"Their are no words to describe this grand historic epic. Gladiator is a film everybody would enjoy, for it has a great story, great action and superb acting (no wonder Crowe got an Oscar!) Gladiator recounts the story of one of the greatest Roman generals Maximus, who was forced to slavery by the corrupt incestuous heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) who killed Marcus Aurelius the emperor for he knew he offered Maximus power over his own son. Maximus has then become his worst enemy. Commodus having ordered to kill him and his family, Maximus escapes death and as becomes the general who became a slave, the slave who became gladiator, and the gladiator who defied an emperor. Gladiator has some of the most beautiful scenery and CGI effects I have ever seen. IT really is one of the best ""recent"" films out there. The script is also very effective and suiting, and somehow adds a poetic feel to it and so does the superb music used. The actors all did very well in their roles, though Crowe dominated, it is also a memorable performance by Phoenix and Nielsen most memorably and also Hounsou and Harris. Gladiator really does deserve all the awards and nominations it has received. I can assure you, that if you haven't seen this films yet, it should really be the next on your list!",
182,2 January 2001,ltj36,10, Maximus Movie,"We thought that the star of director Ridley Scott was going to disappear thanks to unsuccessful movies like the good  ""Albatross"" or the really weird ""G. I. Jane"", but fortunately he is came back with a success like ""Gladiator"" and a promising title like ""Hannibal"". Even if doesn't absolutely respect history, this movie is a beautiful work and a great wonder for our eyes. Scott directs the battle with great ability, helped by the editing of the great Italian Pietro Scalia (Academy Award winner for ""JFK""): the initial battle in the woods is frenetic and impressive with the force of a thunder and the fights in the arenas are exceptional, a demonstration of what the evolution in movies can do. And also the cast, which sometimes is sacrificed for the show, shows a very great power: Russell Crowe is a suffering but determined Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix an evil, weak and complex Commodus, Connie Nielsen is so beautiful than good actress and then there is a great english trio formed by Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed (dead during the shots). Giorgio Cantarini (Benigni's son in ""La Vita è Bella"") plays the brief role of Maximus' son. We mustn't also forget the red photography by John Mathieson, the rich art direction of Arthur Max (a name, a program) and the wonderful themes composed by Hans Zimmer, featuring the splendid vocals of Lisa Gerrard. Wonderful!",
183,5 November 2019,acedj,9, Another Ridley Scott masterpiece,"There is very little fault one can find in this film. It is the story of Maximus, a roman general who is betrayed by the son of his Caesar. After escaping execution, Maximus ends up fighting as a gladiator, with an eye for vengeance. Russell Crowe is magnificent in this role. He brings such poise and humility to the character, it is impossible not to be sympathetic. Joaquin Phoenix is equally as excellent in his role, and the polar opposite of Maximus. I would not only recommend this movie, but I would further insist that you watch the director's cut. It comes in at just under three hours of run time, but it will certainly not feel like it. I would put this in my top 10 movies you should see before you die list.",

185,9 October 2015,serafinogm,9, Really good film with an opening battle scene that is incredible!,"Loved this movie but the best sequence was at the beginning when the disciplined, methodical, Roman Army slaughtered a disorganized German horde in a filmed battle sequence with no equal other than perhaps the storming of Normandy beach from Spielberg's movie Saving Private Ryan! Tactics will beat brute force every time! The emperor overseeing this slaughter was Marcus Aurelius who was the last of the adoptive emperors, also referred to as the 'Good Emperors'. It started with Nerva, who adopted Trajan, who in turn adopted Hadrian, who was followed by Antoninus Pius who in turn was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius. During their rule there was a considerable expansion of the Roman empire, from northern Britain to Dacia and to Arabia and Mesopotamia, followed by a consolidation and an attempt to perfect the empire's defenses (e.g. Hadrian's Wall in Britain). This all started to unravel under Commodus (son of Marcus Aurelius). The period of the adoptive emperors started with the assassination of a horrible emperor (Domitian) and ended with another horrible emperor (Commodus who also was assassinated). This is all historical fact and that's the end of the movie's factual content everything else is just fiction! But enjoyable fiction with the formulaic mistake of turning the main protagonist into something of a superhero and that's why it isn't getting a 10!",

Bladerunner is a terrific flick and Alien ain't too shabby, either.  Then I saw the trailers for Gladiator and some early reviews(almost exclusively raves) and got excited for a good, well-made film.  What I got was the most boring movie I've seen in a theater in quite some time.  Initially, I gave the film the benefit of the doubt...a lot of people liked this so it must get interesting sooner or later.  About 45 minutes into the film, however, I realized it wasn't going to get any better.  I first looked at my watch at that point and proceeded to do so at least every ten minutes thereafter.  I hoped the reel would catch fire and save me from watching the last hour but, alas, I had to watch until the end.

He is also, once again, what stands as a true definition of a man. A man has to be responsible and patient, and this man just does that. If I have to pick a single most influential person besides Jesus, I'd still go with Maximus. What he did in the movie was truly outstanding and I wish that he was an actual person in history. The death of his family gave him a small moment of despair, but he took it all in, including the loss of his rank and his status now as a ""slave."" As Maximus gradually progresses as a gladiator in the movie, he just becomes more and more bad ass, being the true hero of the entire movie. He never flinches in pain, but stands up, all the way to the end.

The buildup of the battles is phenomenal, the fight choreography is perfect and Russel Crowe and quakine phoenix give the performances of a lifetime. The blood/gore affects are also really good in this. But one of my few problems with the movie is how historically inaccurate it is. Like it's barely even based on true events. But that is only a small complaint for an otherwise phenomenal period pice/action movie",

Imagine Spartacus as directed by Akira Kurosawa. Imagine the chariot race in Ben Hur,  then ratchet up the action and special effects. The ancient world is brought to life so believably, so beautifully, that you are free to follow the incredible action without distraction. Russell Crowe is great as Maximus, the Roman general turned slave then gladiator - this performance will make him a Star. I won't spoil it for you by spilling the entire story - you get the idea - just go see Gladiator the moment it comes out, this is a classic.",
241,30 March 2001,teejayniles2345,10, Plot goes haywire - power surges abound,"Gladiator overwhelmed the opposition in Academy voting this year.  Yet those who cry ""foul"" are strikingly naive in their calls for some sort of recount. It is a prime example of Oscar voters going for a big winner when the ""second-place"" entries managed to cancel out one another's separate claims to be better overall films.  This BEST PICTURE shows signs of being less than the sum of most of its commendable parts, due in greatest part to its haywire plot.  Like the much feared power surges for people's home and work computers, it has plenty of emotional highs and striking brief scenes or cuts but they short-circuit the narrative that you want to puzzle through after the final credits.  I believe the screenplay could have made some sort of ""revisionist"" sense about an introspective Emperor but he is throttled and overthrown in some sort of flip-flop of fortunes that's left unexplained.  Don't blame Joaquin Phoenix for overacting when he seemingly improvises with the lurching dialogue.  For anybody trying to make sense of slavery and gladiators, see a much better film from 1960, Spartacus. Back then actor Kirk Douglas and buddies were telling the director what the finished product should be.  Nowadays, the director uses all the arrows in his quiver to nail us to the trees and we wonder what's hit us as the spectacle overpowers the story.",

The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world.

With a big budget and Ridley Scott at the helm, Gladiator is high powered entertainment. Epic in scope with a huge cast and great f/x, this is a marvel to look at and was put together well. A great mix of drama and action with political schemes and battle scenes. The acting was very good all around with character actors like Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. Joaquin Phoenix was a good antagonist and Russel Crowe gave a commanding presence as the lead delivering a powerful performance that won him a richly deserved Oscar for best actor. I remember seeing this at the theater and it completely blew away Mel Gibson's weak attempt to relive the glory of Braveheart with the failed(and very lame) epic The Patriot. Gladiator comes really close to being as good as Braveheart and at times is also very bloody. Gladiator is also bloody good and is well put together all around.

It has impeccable set design and costumes that creates the time and place in which the entire movie takes place. It has a script that is so well written that you will never become bored or wish that the movie would hurry up. When you combine all of these things together how could the film not turn out to be the winner of five academy awards and become one of the top rated movies ever. The acting first of all. Russel Crowe is amazing as Maximus, he gives such a focused, raw, intense performance that will without a doubt move you to tears. Phoenix is also great here, very evil dedicated character that will do anything, basically there are no limits to his wickedness and Phoenix plays it all so well. So all in all the acting is out of this world great. The story is very well put together and it has the appropriate emotional ties built into it so that the audience is pulled in and they care about the characters and what happens to them. The combat sequences are very very well filmed, I was impressed by the quality of those scenes in particular. The sets and costumes and just about anything technical is all very intricate and done with careful attention to detail. 10/10 for Gladiator!

There were some very interesting and original aspects to the film: Crowe's character was not one-dimensional. Neither was Phoenix's character. However, the direction was terrible and there were some implausible action sequences. In the Coliseum, we see a chariot attack upon huddled gladiators. The action seems confused, and rightly so. Play it out in slow-mo and you'll see gaps where people disappear and reappear. This jumbled computer generated mess looks pale in comparison to the live action scenes shot in the 60's. The part where Maximus throws his sword 100 feet to kill a guy was ludicrous; like a cartoon. The shots of the Coliseum were lacking. It was as if Scott couldn't afford to hire extras to be in the crowd. The sets seemed shabby and dark. The sequence at the beginning where the Romans fight the Barbarians was very well done and memorable. Too bad this quality could not last throughout the film. The ending was not satisfying enough. Maximus should have rammed the sword down Commodus' throat. I'll close with repeating that the computer generated action sequences were poorly done.

I personally did not care about Maximus  a man with the minimus of personality  or indeed about any of the barely sketched figures which people the film. I also found Ridley Scott's visual style contemptuous. He does not seem the least bit concerned about making images with meaning or power but merely illustrates the script with pretty, overly crowded pictures. Most of it looked like an expensive advert. I kept expecting the actors to climb into a bath and eat a flake, or a new model of car to drive by, or the gladiators to run round the stadium in adidas trainers!

The Gladiator tries to act like Mel Gibson, look like Mel and talk like Mel (probably because they are from the same birthplace).  But if you must have an actor that portrays too much of another actor, you might as well have that actor that is being portrayed in the movie instead of somebody else.  The plot and theme of ""Gladiator"" is also like ""Braveheart"".  let's face it, if you've seen ""Braveheart"" because that one came out before ""Gladiator"" then you know what ""Gladiator"" is all about.

But it's ultimately a three-character movie (Maximus, Lucilla, and Commodfus)and none of those three characters are all that interesting. The ending should be devastating in terms of emotional content, but it just lacks the heart of earlier Roman epics like ""Spartacus"" and even ""Quo Vadis"".  And, despite the lavish computer-generated effects, the film is sorely missing an epic scope.  Contrast Commodus's arrival in Rome with Cleo's spectacular entrance in the '63 ""Cleopatra"".

My only complaint is that Crowe's ""General Maximus"" comes off as a bit too much of an innocent for his lofty position as a commander of legions of men.  Crowe manages, in spite of this, to make you believe Maximus is a commanding man, a true leader.  Ridley Scott certainly cast the best man for the job.

While a simple revenge dominates the plot, it really gives director Ridley Scott a chance to re-imagine ancient Rome as it was before its historical downfall. His vision is astounding, with plenty of graphic battle sequences (many of which are enhanced by CGI), great acting, and all-around epic greatness.

329,7 July 2000,Melville-7,1, An overrated mess.,"Aside from Russell Crowe's strong performance, GLADIATOR is a chaotic mess. The editing is jumbled and confused, especially in the Arena scenes. To say this confusion is ""realistic"" is absurd, since when facing an opponent in the Arena, the most important thing is to remain clearheaded and outmaneuver him if you are to win. The celebrated battle in the forest in the beginning is just a silly attempt to ape the D-Day segment in the similarly overrated SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. As for the supporting performances, the best that can be said is that Richard Harris is dour and Oliver Reed is enjoyably hammy. Joaquin Phoenix is never convincing for a moment as the emperor. His performance would be more at home in a modern high school pageant. The photography resembles a European perfume commercial more than an evocation of ancient times. I wasn't aware the only color available in Rome was gold. For a truly excellent version of the same story, check out Anthony Mann's superb 1964 FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. While both films are based on the same historical characters, GLADIATOR shamelessly ""borrows"" many plot points from the earlier film, to less effect. Russell Crowe's supporting cast cannot hope to compete with such classic actors as Alec Guiness, Christopher Plummer, James Mason and Sophia Loren in FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. It would also be pointless to compare the directorial style of Anthony Mann, who is without a doubt one of the great American filmmakers of the 50s and 60s, with that of Ridley Scott, who directs like he's making a commercial for GLADIATOR perfume or a music video for a band dressed as ancient Romans. Just compare the finale man to man combat in the Arena in Scott's film with the same scene in Mann's. No comparison.",

It balanced the overlapping narrative threads with such clarity the viewer is always in the know.
Why is it a masterclass movie? Because you don't need to know a thing about the Roman Empire to fully get into the story and meaning of the movie.

Just the fact that this movie ends by Maximus getting his revenge in a 1 on 1 death duel against the Emperor seems so lame and so Hollywood. Couldn't you give us an intelligent, realistic ending (like the Emperor has Maximus executed but then someone else comes in Mark Wahlberg in The Departed style and ends up killing the Emperor anyways)? Something other than the simple A-to-B ending it has. It's just a shame because it's such an awesome, epic movie. The writing and story is so smart; there's not a single bad scene. The visuals are epic. The Emperor character is the only reason this beast of a movie earns a 9, not a 10.",

It's a massive epic motion picture that pleases your eyes and ears with effective visuality, drama, romance and more. The story tells about a Roman general Maximus who gets betrayed by an evil prince. By the acts of the prince, Maximus's family gets murdered and he wanders into sorrow where tears won't be spared. He then finds himself captured to become a gladiator among other slaves, but he still seeks for revenge. Maximus tries to keep himself alive in battles which he is forced into, only that he might someday take his revenge against the evil prince.

Some of this might be intentional because story is very much one of blunt masculinity. Further, some the choices made in regards to the history are just laughably bad. No Rome did not become a republic again in 180 AD (or whatever). Commodus is made far to much of a coward as well.

This is a master collaboration, between Russel Crowe (whom I have seen in other roles before and as Maximus Aurelius is supreme) , and Ridley Scott, the revolutionary Einstein of film making and the phrase comes to mind whenever I see this film. These two are the men's men and Gladiator is a movie about rising and falling and rising and falling again but with dignity and passion. Another standout is Joaquin Phoenix who played the conniving, power-hungry, incapable, brutal, unpopular emperor who killed his father for the throne and framed Maximus and killed his wife and son for it. Who will ever forget, "" And I shall have my revenge, in this life or the next "" .

Gladiator is one of those movies. It has all the elements that makes for a good movie. There is a compelling story, an altruistic hero, a sinister villain, a damsel and her young son, excellent musical score, great cinematography, great support cast, strong dialog and a solid finale. The movie has become a Hollywood icon. Its characters have achieved legendary status. Jaoquin Phoenix is superb as the Emperor Commodus, who is reviled by everyone, including his own sister. (Yet this does not stop the indefatigable emperor from doing his paperwork.) Russell Crowe gives a tour-de-force performance as Maximus, the hero general who refuses to cave in to the vindicative and jealous emperor. Oliver Reed, in his final performance, is great as Maximus's friend and ally. The scenes in the Colosseum are spectacular; the Colosseum itself is shown in all of its grandeur, a fitting venue for the kinds of spectacles that became symbols of Roman decadence and cruelty. All in all, this is a wonderful movie, one that deservedly is a classic.",

Julius kills his own father and terrifies his own sister. He kills Maximus' wife and son. Maximus is presumed dead but survives and avenges Caesar. It's a grand spectacle something like an old epic from the golden days of Hollywood. The acting is quite good with casting Richard Harris and Sir Derek Jacobi in supporting roles.

Maximus was well loved by the Roman soldiers as well as Ceasar. Connie Nielsen,(Lucilla),""Basic"",'03, was the daughter of Ceasar and was a former lover of Maximus. There are a great deal of twists and turns in this story concerning Maximus and he eventually has the great task of fighting among Gladiators.

A motion picture that presumes to be (visually) ""a Roman Saving Private Ryan"" but carefully avoids showing the horrors that were plain in Saving Private Ryan.  Somewhere I get the idea that either producer or director must have thought : ""Yes great, let him charge into his opponent and hack his head of with one single mighty sweep.  But, as we want as many spectators as we can get, let's put a tree between the audience and the guy who gets his head chopped off."" So there you are, half the movie embedded in a semblance of violence that pretends to be shocking but isn't in the least.  Which is acceptable if you're broadminded enough, after all there's the other half of the movie. Unfortunately the actors (with the exception of the revered Derek Jacobi) must have felt similarly about the ""action"" scenes, because they try with all their might to ""act"" their way through the rest of the movie.  There's nothing as irritating as an actor being very aware of the fact that he's acting and showing it !  See how good I am ? But even then : the story might be good. Which it isn't.  The story of ""Gladiator"" is a flimsy excuse for a second rate B-movie plot . With excuses to anyone who ever wrote a B-movie plot. Did anyone actually get paid for writing this ?  Historically staggeringly incorrect hardly begins to describe it !  Full of dead ends (let's not reveal the ""plot"") and dead dialogue. May I suggest something ?  Don't spend money to see it.

Before seeing ""Gladiator"" I didn't think it was possible to make one that isn't worth watching; and, indeed, Ridley Scott hasn't done so either, although he certainly seems to have tried, and his film certainly is bad.  For a film set in Rome at its most magnificent there's remarkably little spectacle (and what little there is is largely computer-generated - appallingly).  For a film so reliant on fighting the combat scenes are confusingly, ineptly, MORONICALLY, shot and edited. Scott's latest fascination is with triple-framing.  Every moment of combat looks as if it was lit by a stroboscopic lamp.  This, plus occluded angles of view, over-use of extreme telephoto lenses, and rapid, more or less random editing - all combine to make it next to impossible to tell what the hell's going on.  How I miss the clean, clear spectacle of ""Spartacus"" or ""Ben-Hur"".  The other thing I miss is a score by Alex North or (better still) Miklós Rózsa.  Hans Zimmer's music (think of ""Crimson Tide"", but more minimalist, more new-agey, less tuneful) is horribly out of place (and just not very good); it combines with the stupid camera-work to make the whole film play like a music video - or a 154-minute trailer for something else.",

Yes, there have been pathetic, postmodern attempts to cinematically resurrect Rome since the Golden Age of ancient epics of the 50s and early 60s, but none have come close to the historic-artistic integration that Scott has pulled off in GLADIATOR.

The whole movie tries very hard to radiate grandeur and epic heroism but it just totally fails. Acting was crap, most actors were statues talking without intonation while Crowe walked around the whole movie looking worried and silly and not like the heroic general he was supposed to be.. Music was junk (didn't expect it at all from Hans Zimmer, normally excellent..). The whole movie just didn't have the atmosphere it could have had.

I have now watched it three times and have not changed my mind after the first time I saw it. It didn't 'feel' right and although I can safely say that a lot of time and effort went into its creation I just cannot in all seriousness recommend this film to anyone. The story line is fairly strong and most of the performances are reasonable but I was not impressed with the special effects. The special effects in my opinion did not enhance my enjoyment of the film indeed they had a negative effect on me. On my initial viewing I was also not at all impressed with the leading man. Russell Crowe in my opinion was given far too much praise for his performance. Joaquin Phoenix was adequate and some of the other performances were OK but in my opinion there was more than one person miscast in this film and overall this is not a good combination. I am not at all interested and never have been that I may be the only one who happens to be a dissenting voice.

""Gladiator"" is a gloriously retro sword-and-sandal epic, a cross-pollination of ""Spartacus,"" ""Ben Hur,"" and ""The Fall of the Roman Empire""; director Ridley Scott uses modern CGI technology to make the kind of movie they don't make any more. Although not 100% historically accurate, it's irresistible drama. Russell Crowe is one of the few actors today who can pull off this kind of heroic role; he has the gravitas despite his bad-boy reputation in real life that blond pretty boys like Brad Pitt and Colin Farrell can never hope to approach. Connie Nielsen is a sensuous presence as Lucilla; River Phoenix as Commodus is the creepiest villain since Ralph Fiennes' Amos Goetz in ""Schindler's List""; and the supporting cast is full of stand out performances. It's good to see ""I Claudius""'s Derek Jacobi back in toga; what's an epic without Richard Harris? and of course Oliver Reed as the lovably irascible slave-trader Proximo, who proves not to be such a bad guy after all.

Ridley Scott needs n0 apologies, especially considering the likes of his ""Duelists""?, but the total corniness and gallery-getting antics of this film are laughable. Some cable channel reran this turkey a couple nights ago, and I watched a few scenes again, and marvelled at how Hollywood-can=you-get? in this day and age of relative realities, on screen and off. The ""character"" castings, of course, were par for the corny course, but, to me at least, neither Russell Crown nor Joaqu;in Phoenix could invest his character with anything but schmaltz.

417,14 May 2000,richie-29,5," great action, no heart. (SPOILERS)","I came into this movie hearing rave reviews about it, but afterwards, I must say I was rather disappointed. To be fair, the CGI shots of the crowds at The Colluseum were gorgeous, and the fight scenes were top notch. However Gladiator was missing something that other historical epics had, and that was emotion. In Spartacus, we see the horrible conditions that Spartacus and the slaves lived in, and we rooted for them to fight for their freedom. In Braveheart, the film spends a great deal of time developing the romance between Wallace and his wife, and when she's killed by the English, there is a greater emotional response when Wallace fights the English. There was none of that in Gladiator. Although, we see Maximus' wife and son murdered, I felt nothing, since practically no time time was spent fleshing out their relationship. And also Maximus' goal is to overthrow Commodus as emperor and bring control of the Roman Empire to the Senate. I don't know about you, but government restructuring pales in comparison to trying to topple a kingdom. By the time the movie ended, I really didn't care who won or lost. I give Gladiator a 5/10 (5 is for the special effects.)",

The former, despite an annoying lead performance by Charlton Heston, had taste and craftsmanship, the latter, despite a somewhat one-note performance by Kirk Douglas, had irony and intelligence.

The film stars resident Aussie heartthrob, Russell Crowe as Maximus, a loyal General to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (the late and very great Richard Harris). After a victorious campaign in Germania, Marcus decides that Maximus will succeed him on the throne; a move that does not bode well with the Emperor's only son and legitimate heir, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Determined to secure his birthright, Commodus murders his father before he has a chance to tell Maximus of his placement, and shortly thereafter frames Maximus for that murder. And although Commodus' sister  and sometimes incestuous playmate, Lucilla (Connie Nielson) is both enamored and loyal to her father and Maximus there is little she can do but acquiesce to Commodus' sycophantic desire to be loved, in order to keep his psychotic wrath at bay.

I thought the 90s had finally brought movies with such appalling heroic pathos to an end. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Not only does Ridley Scott make usually excellent actors bring forth lines that let ""The Phantom Menace"" ring like Shakespeare in my ears. He also shows no scruples whatsoever twisting history around entirely and making the Roman Empire look like a benevolent pacifier. All in all, if it weren't for a few corrupt Senators and a megalomaniac young emperor, Rome seems to have had no flaws for Scott whatsoever. Ah, a little genocide here, some imperialism there...the others were all ""barbarians"" anyway.

He is a born leader and warrior who has only one dream: to defeat all who oppose his Emperor and to retire back to his Spanish farm with his wife and son. When those things are taken from him by the ruthless Commodus his initial welcoming of death becomes tempered as he sees a way to return vengeance upon those who have destroyed him. Ridley Scott deserves most of the congratulations as it is he who once again delivers us the kind of movie he is capable of making, beautiful, graphic but above all else utterly absorbing. The special effects and the music are amazing and serve to draw you completely into the film as its story unfolds and not once do you find yourself thinking 'Nah, that didn't look real'.

Joaquin Phoenix also gives what is probably his best performance ever, and definitely deserved an Oscar for it. Russell Crowe, although great in the movie, seems to have play his character on one note, making it a mystery how he got one and Joaquin didn't.

But length alone doesn't make a movie seem long.  In fact, some movies that are very long don't seem very long at all, such as the Lawrence of Arabia, the Godfather movies and Braveheart, all riveting throughout.  No, Gladiator's problem was that it was obviously going for the look and feel of an epic.  It got the look just right.  No question, this movie looked fantastic; can't possibly give an argument there.  Unfortunately, the film didn't have enough story for an epic.  Solution?  To have long stretches of dialogue and to have long pauses between each line of dialogue which, by the way, was very, very bad.

It is too big to put into an action film. When Phoenix describes the deaths of the gladiator's wife and son; the action is stopped. Scripts that have power are unstoppable trains. The camera work is dark throughout. There is a haze over every scene of unfocused surroundings. Computer generated stadium and battle scenes are over used and lack sharpness. The sword fight between Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix looks unchoreographed and dangerous to the actors.

Three hours long when it should have been 90 minutes, the film has little to go for it apart from Russell Crowe's glower and a wash of grainy CGI effects. I will never understand how Joaquin Phoenix, who is a descent actor (Just watch ""To Die For"") managed to get an Oscar nomination for aping Malcom McDowell's performance in ""Caligula.""

I don't mean to imply that there is any resemblance between Gladiator and one of Shakespeare's plays, or that the dialogue resembles one of them. But the creation of a truly heroic character in a pivotal role is a classical and, unfortunately, out of date device.  It requires an actor who can not only convince you that his character possesses a heroic and noble nature, but who can also make you care terribly about what happens to this hero.  Crowe does both.  The viewer loves and admires his Maximus, and agonizes with him in his travails.  In this, Crowe reminded me of Laurence Olivier at a comparable age, although I'd guess he would cringe at the comparison. As to the rest of the cast, I couldn't find a single weak link.  In fact, the only thing I didn't like about the movie was the extent of the gore in the battle and gladiator scenes.

The acting is marvelous, with Crowe, Phoenix and Reed(R.I.P.) bringing their roles to life. All characters are credible and well-developed. The fighting, although apparently not consistent with reality of how they were trained, is really cool; they're of varying length with nice choreography. They're covered in close-ups and with hand-held, which really gives them a sense of intensity. The scope is epic, and this is realistic and authentic, giving you a feel of how it was back then. This has well-done FX, you basically can't tell the CGI from the real. The photography is excellent, with really impressive visuals. Dialog is fine. It is a tad Hollywood, as the overall thing is. Honestly, I would rate Spartacus higher than this. Kirk has gravitas far beyond that of Russell, the battles are *unforgettable* and powerful, the interplay between the people is heartfelt and rings true(and pays off), and the story is simply more inspirational(slave rises up against his master, early human rights campaign... this is just ""I'm going to get back what I lost or get payback for it"", and could have been set any other time or place).

It did, the story was a little hollywood, but gave a good description of the brutality, and views of the time. I will not spoil the story, but it is sort of out a Shakespearian play, with revenge being the main motivator in the story line.  This give you a good feel for the brutality of the time, and the sort of honor that follows this hypocrisy. A good epic. The budget was big enough to make this a believable epic, and the action is done with perfection.  It's nice to see lesser name actors in films these day, because it give you bigger over all budget for the film instead of watching some one get payed 30 million and it hurts the rest of the film.

The movie was also a hit with an R rating which is why I will never understand why they weaken so many films these days, bringing them down to PG-13 thinking this is going to bring them more money. This one proves that you can make a ton of cash with an R rating. This along with other R films like ""300"", the entire Matrix trilogy, ""Hannibal"" (hell this one wasn't even a good movie"", and a host of others yet they still insist on making most movies PG-13. Well enough of that rant, on to this film. Its story is fairly good involving the leader of an army who is basically retiring after the death of the emperor. Well his son for some reason tries to have him killed and does succeed in killing the soldier's family. Well the soldier ends up being sold and becomes a gladiator who amazes the crowd with his awesome brutality. Well he ends up competing in the coliseum where the man who had his family murder watches. So in the end a nice bloody film and one of the few best picture winners I have ever seen at the theater. I think the only other Oscar winners I have seen at the theater are ""Titanic"" and ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"". This one is good, I do not know if it really merited an Oscar, but I am not going to say something else deserved it that year either as I remember it being a rather weak year for movies.",

I enjoyed this movie so much that I recommended this movie to all my friends and even my teachers. Actually, my World Literature teacher liked it so much that she got permission to show it to our class. It has great actors in it as well. Joaquin Phoenix is hot and is perfect for the part of Commodus. He has the look and the acting attitude for the evil emperor. Russel Crowe is an awesome actor in anything that he is in. He also has his part down pat. I could not imagine anyone else playing the part of Maximus. I also like what Hans Zimmer did to the music for this film. I love the instruments and the word choices for the film. I am actually listening to the second soundtrack to the movie. I love the way the music reminds me of the different parts of the movie.

469,3 November 2004,JamesHitchcock,8, Excellent Revival of the Epic Tradition,"One of the strange aspects of cinematic history is how an entire genre of films can suddenly lose favour and disappear. In the fifties and early sixties big historical epics, with story lines normally drawn either from the Bible or from classical antiquity, were one of the most popular types of film, and their popularity seemed assured after the huge successes of 'Ben-Hur' in 1959 and 'Spartacus' the following year. A few years later, however, they all but disappeared from the screen after the financial failures of 'Cleopatra' and 'The Fall of the Roman Empire'. The genre seemed to be dead and gone; when the film-makers of the late sixties, seventies and eighties made films on a large scale, they generally turned to other subject-matter (often organised crime or science fiction).",

473,6 June 2000,spinin,10, This movie kicked my butt!,"""Gladiator"" is a very simple story. Most of the time, it is a typical war hero adventure. Sometimes it even appears stupid. The plot is not very complex and gets repetitive. The hero kills because he must and that is enough reason for him. He wants to avenge the death of his wife and his kid so he will plow through his enemies until he gets to the man responsible. When he does, he will save the day and all will be well. There are a bunch of other war adventure cliches in between the major plot events. Normally, no matter how compelling the story is, a simple war film will not win me over 100 percent. Although ""Gladiator"" is very one-dimensional and predictable at times, it surpasses other similar movies. Many elements contributed to grasp my attention and have me surrender to this adventure.",

They struggled writing the script, which I think shows on the screen. The acting is also uneven, with some great moments and some weaker ones.

477,28 September 2004,paul2001sw-1,7, History updated,"According to the brilliant but eccentric historian Gibbon, the succession of the philosopher-king Marcus Aurelius by his mad son Commodus marked the start of the decline of the Roman Empire. It was this event which provided the setting for Anthony Mann's 1960s film, 'The Fall of the Roman Empire', and 'Gladiator' is a modern reworking of the same story, with a hefty nod to Kubrick's 'Spartacus' as well. At first, what catches the attention is what's new in the film: the odd, Enya-esque soundtrack and the impressive, almost convincing but over-used computer generated animation (I mean, how many digitally-enhanced thunderstorms does one film need?). But behind the slickness, what's more noticeable is how firmly this film sits in the tradition of earlier Roman epics. I rather like this genre, as the inherent political and personal drama in these almost true stories is immense; though in 'Gladiator', some of the potential is lost through sentimentality and a tendency to reduce events to an elemental struggle of good and evil. Russell Crowe in particular, all honour and valour, is dull in the central role. But as is usual in films such as this, a clutch of talented British thespians lend some class to the project: in this case, Richard Griffiths, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel and of course Oliver Reed, his magnificent eyes still wild with life (though he died before filming was complete). Overall, 'Gladiator' is a welcome addition to a canon that has lain untouched since 'Cleopatra'. What I'd really like to see, though, is a film of the life of Dicoletian, one of Gibbon's few heroes in the long tale of the dark years.",

However, Commodus manages to kill his father and succeed him before he carries out his plans, becoming absolute lord of Rome and orders to kill Maximus and all his family.

483,18 April 2023,CinemaSerf,8, Gladiator,"This has got just about everything from ""Spartacus"" (1960) to ""Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"" (1964) via a bit of ""Quo Vadis"" (1951) to it - and Ridley Scott has managed to create a magnificent spectacle of a film. Russell Crowe is the eponymous soldier ""Maximus"". Commander of the Armies of the Rhine for Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) and his designated successor - until, that is, the emperor's son ""Commodus"" (Joaquin Phoenix) and his sister ""Lucilla"" (an efficient Connie Nielsen) arrive and suddenly it's all change at the top. Betrayed and left for dead, our hero must now make other shifts if he is to survive in his new world - controlled by slave-owning ""Proximo"" (Oliver Reed) and deliver him of vengeance on his new Imperial nemesis. The film looks great, the cast - including some some strong supporting efforts from Sir Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, Djimon Hounsou and Tomas Arana all contribute well to this grandeur of this historical saga. The high politics, betrayal and duplicity are matched with a sense of integrity and camaraderie as ""Maximus"" begins to galvanise his colleagues and his political allies into something more than a disparate band fighting just to survive each day. Reed and Harris both feature only sparingly, but both add a richness to the characterisations that are dominated by two on-form performances from Crowe and Phoenix that epitomise a struggle of good versus evil and ultimate power in an empire where corruption and brutality trade human life as if it were a watermelon. Add to this some superb visual effects and a rousing score from Hans Zimmer (and Lisa Gerrard) and we have a compelling watch on a big screen that shows there is still a glimmer of the Cecil B. De Mille spirit left in Hollywood.",

However, scenes of bloody violence are gratuitous. The script may not be historically accurate but it is surely entertaining.

489,3 July 2008,Dr_Coulardeau,9, The illusion of Roman civilization,"This extended version is a lot denser that what I remembered of the 2000 commercial version. The politics of Rome are explored in a lot more detail, particularly that strange power the Roman Emperor had because of his own praetorian guard that was doing absolutely everything he ordered, and took orders only from the Emperor. At the end, when the Emperor is dead or nearly dead because he is defeated and disarmed, they refuse to obey their own officer. They will obey him only when the sister comes down and legitimizes Maximus. You only meet servile people and even the Senate and the Senators are just as servile out of fear for their welfare. That could be extended to today, even if today in our democratic countries this manipulation of people is less obvious, less direct, less based on the fear of the leaders but on the fear of an external danger propped up and exploited by the leaders. Fear is still the main nerve of the crowd, and then provide them with some bread and good circus entertainment and they will follow your fears to the end of the world. The film is also extremely clear about two barbaric practices of this supposedly civilized Roman Empire. The conquest war that is not, far from it, always justified by any offensive aggressivity from the ""barbarians"" from beyond the frontiers of the empire. It is brutal and unequal. The advanced technology of the time is on the Roman side. Easy to win when you add to this advanced technology the military professionalism of the Roman Legion. And even so it is shown as what it is: an unclean inhumane and inhuman practice. Worse even the film shows the slave trade and the total reduction of these slaves not even to animals but to objects, properties, commodities you deal with and dispose of the way you want. What the film does not say is that the vast majority of this Roman society is composed of slaves, house slaves, garden slaves, hard work slaves, sex slaves and of course the famous gladiators, the fighting slaves. They all end in death, these slaves, a vast majority premature death imposed onto them by their masters or circumstances, but always to satisfy the desire of a free Roman citizen. The particularity of gladiators is that their end is to die in public from the hand of another gladiator or just mangled by a wild beast or some technical trap. At the top of the ladder of that death is the death decided by the Emperor himself. The film is of course extremely precise about these circus entertainments though concentrating only on the gladiators. There were many other ways to entertain the populace in the Coliseum, true entertainment always bringing death to some people down there in the arena for the real pleasure of the public. This has not changed at all, I mean the pleasure of being the witness of some gross, violent, repulsive dying process imposed onto the dying person by one or many other human beings. The only change is that it does not happen in circuses any more, and with real live, if I can say so, performances of the death of each victim. We have invented in the meantime a machine that enables us to give the illusion of seeing that and yet that does not happen for real. That is called the cinema. In the old days, the Greeks had dramatic productions for that cathartic function, but the Romans did not want anything illusionary, they wanted the real thing and they got it for several centuries with these gladiators and later the Christians, and all the time the executing in public places of all discontents, and even, when you could afford a slave, the real torturing and killing in all possible variations of your slave. We seem to forget, and this film reminds us of it, that the Roman Empire, and before it the Greek or Hellenistic empire was just based on the inflicting of death to any kind of people as the very justification of the social order, the political order or plainly your own prestige or authority. And some speak of this empire as a great period of civilization. Due to these slaves some inventions like watermills devised in the first century BCE were only exploited in the 10th century CE by the Benedictines, hence in the middle of what some call the dark ages (sorry no capital letters). A great film in this extended version.",

Not a single sparkle of authenticity. I won't deny the utility of special effects, but I can't be alone on this one. CGI has cheapened the epic by inserting flat digital figures where beautifully three-dimensional human extras once stood, and by creating green-screen worlds that never have the depth of real locations.

508,9 June 2007,ianlouisiana,6," ""Infamy! Infamy!...they've all got it in for me!""","Along with many Ridley Scott films ""Gladiator"" is cleverly made,full of dialogue that at first hearing sounds deeper and and more meaningful than it actually is and comic - book characters.

A few British TV actors appear as Senators and such,to very little effect I'm afraid,their over-familiarity does them or the movie no favours.Presumably ""Isn't that the bloke from Z Cars?"" was not the response Mr Scott was looking for. Where the movie scores is in the Special Effects department. The fight scenes are well - handled,the tigers being particularly impressive,but CGI alone do not a great movie make. The late Oliver Reed acts almost as if he knows ""Gladiator"" is going to be his last hurrah,it's all in his eyes,most of his dialogue is pretty banal.His leonine head held high with obvious effort,he gives the movie what little gravitas it possesses.His may have been a somewhat checkered career but he went out with all guns blazing.

509,14 July 2012,cmortimer362,3," Worst ""historical"" movie ever","I remember watching this film when I was maybe 12, and I loved it. Now, 8 years later, I rewatched it (extended edition) and realised how awful this movie really is. I hope I'm not nitpicking, because it felt to me that the points I am going to make were there just to insult the viewers intelligence. -First major battle scene. Romans have siege weapons just lying around, on the front line of Germania? They are obviously hard to transport, and there is no reason for them to be there. -Crowe says later that there were roughly 10,000 roman soldiers on the battlefield, with 2,000 dead. Thats funny because I could probably count the number of roman soldiers who were shown to have died on 1 hand, whereas the number of barbarians killed was massive. -Crowe says the casualties sustained by the cavalry by the siege weapons were necessary, then does nothing but complain about how many of his men died. -Russell Crowe sneaks out of the fort with his cavalry and somehow manages to encircle thousands of barbarians, without them ever noticing. Also, the barbarians just stand there and allow this to happen. -The choice of softly spoken British accents for the romans was awful. I'm not saying they should of spoken in full Latin, but that is no reason for them to speak in those annoying accents. -After the battle, the emperor, the emperors son and his daughter are all within maybe a days ride of the Germanian front line? That makes no sense, why would such important figures be there at all? -Crowe is described as Rome's best general by Caesar, yet he is Spanish, lives on a farm and has no involvement in politics. -Caesar says he is close to death, yet he journeyed from Rome presumably to the front line of Germania. Why didn't he stay in Rome? -Caesar bestows Crowe with the title of Protector of Rome, a man who is Spanish, has little interest or skill in politics and wants nothing more than to go home. Good choice Caesar. -Crowe's slave(he's never called a slave) has a Scottish accent. Is this a nod to the Eagle of the Ninth? Simple stealing of idea because they thought it would work in the Roman context? Or just bad historical accuracy? Also, they are in Germania, so why would there be a Scottish slave there? There isn't any mention of Crowe serving in Britannia. -I can understand Crowe being depicted as an indestructible badass, but seriously, the dude can throw swords that accurately? -Crowe somehow manages to ride from the front line in Germania(which kind of suggests deep in Germania), to Spain, just in time to just miss his wife and son's murderers? Impossible. The farm was still smoking when he got there for god's sake. -After that funny scene where he's covered in snot after finding his wife and son, he's picked up by apparently African slave traders (Carthaginians?). A roman citizen, in a roman province, abducted by slave traders? I don't think I need to explain myself anymore. -So Crowe apparently has an SPQR tattoo, something never practised by Romans at all. The only people who would tattoo themselves were barbarians. So I got 45 minutes in than I gave up. I'll probably get a lot of stick for this review, but I really don't care. If you are looking for a good historically accurate movie with a plot that makes sense I cannot stress enough how frustrated you will be watching this movie. If you have no knowledge of the Roman civilization at all and you are willing to look past all the glaring plot holes and bad accents, there is a lot you will enjoy about this movie. It is full of action and Crowe is a badass. The reason I didn't give this 1 out of 10 is because there were a few enjoyable battle/fight scenes where you could forget about all the stupidness that had occurred for a few minutes. Other than that, there is nothing stopping this from being one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",

It is not inside confidential information anymore, Russell Crowe is not just a fine actor but now he is a big star. His performance as the gladiator was subtle, but yet, powerful. Co-star Joaquin Phoenix also delivered a swashbuckling performance. However, he still has many rivers to cross before he gets to Crowe's acting status.

Top notch acting, an opening battle scene that almost does for that time period what Saving Private Ryan did for WW2 - it recreates the sheer horror inflicted by the Roman Army. Later, the actual gladiator scenes in Rome are also convincingly portrayed. The cerebral elements where we follow the moral strengths and weaknesses of the characters give it more substance than a mere action movie. Its main weakness is probably that which most big Hollywood epics have had - no more than a passing attempt to use the film as an art form - this, as the gladiator organizer says, is entertainment. (Note - from the little history I've been able to glean, the storyline - who kills who - seems to be largely fiction, although the portrayal of the characters of the main players seems reasonable enough and the other details are apparently quite well constructed. So we get quite a reasonable picture of the Empire in this context if we ignore the plot. Perhaps some historians reading this will want to add details about the lives and deaths of Marcus Aurelius, Maximus and Commodus just to keep the record straight.)",

The cinematography was great, and Joaquin Phoenix as the Caesar was excellent(which should have won him an Oscar), but of course Crowe won for an ok performance as best actor.  The film was directed well by Scott, but our appeal to the characters was lacking as opposed to a similar Oscar winner in ""Braveheart"" in that it had a lot of violence but Gibson was wonderfully captivating where Crowe was again just ok.  It seems like Oscar always tends to like a overly-produced epic know matter how good it is these days.  I hope that it returns to simple storytelling for it's best picture winners (aka.

And -Gladiator- is such a film. Russell Crowe gives an extraordinarily textured performance as the central character Maximus, a warrior-poet who chooses private life over public ambition and then finds his world turned upside down. (IMHO, Mr. Crowe should have been the winner of this year's Best Actor Oscar for his work in -The Insider- ; the performance he gives here merely serves to reinforce that conviction.) Connie Nielsen is radiant as Lucilla, daughter to the late emperor Marcus Aurelius (finely played by Richard Harris). Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, and the late Oliver Reed also deserve kudos for their performances. But it is Joaquin Phoenix whom I found the most intriguing. His Commodus is that film rarity : a ""round"" villain...if indeed that word even applies in this case. The character's motivations can be understood, and, even if the choices Commodus makes cannot be approved, at least one can sympathize with the twistedness foisted upon him that leads to such choices. Nine stars out of 10. (Be forewarned: The violence is a bit heavy-going at times...but the Romans didn't build and maintain a worldwide empire by inviting folks to a tea-party!)",

However, in the following years the feature quickly entered the list of Academy Award-winning films that go from beloved to hated, being treated pejoratively among many moviegoers.

What i love about this film is that Ridley Scott made this film look so authentic and mostly thanks to the modern day magic of the blue screen. The scenes of the Colosseum and the gladiatorial fights are the work of a true genius. Of coarse it helps to have a great cast and Russell Crow is the perfect man to play Maximus. His performance is amazing and it leaves you totally believing in everything the Roman did or said. Joaquin Phoenix and Oliver Reed ( who died during the filming of this ) are also fantastic and deserve a great deal of credit for their displays. Gladiator contains one of the most iconic movie scenes of all time - who can forget this "" My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius.

The battle sequences in the beginning are great not only in every detail in close-up plans but also in general view ones. The sound track is fabulous in some scenes. The story is intensely dramatic and well conceived. Of course historic truth is not respected nor it had to be. The artist is not a historian and when he inspires himself in History to make his work he doesn't need to follow truth in every detail providing he doesn't change historical spirit or commits grave falsehood. The artist is a creator not an imitator. His allegiance is to aesthetic values not to historical superficial truth. We know for instance that Commodus was killed by his friends and his concubine Martia and not by a gladiator who was a former general, in the arena, like in the movie but we also know that he was a tyrannical despot and he liked gladiator fights very much, having in fact taken part personally in some of them.

However, I wouldn't allot it quite that much praise. In my humble opinion, speaking that highly of this film would be giving it a little too much credit when it isn't that masterful of a film. It's good, but not that good. It's the story of Maximus, a valiant Roman soldier who is betrayed by his emperor and cast out of Rome, only to return and find his wife and son murdered. Having lost everything, Maximus is captured by slave traders and sold to a man named Proximo who is assembling men to fight in Rome's epic gladiator games. Maximus takes this opportunity to return to Rome and enact his revenge on Commodus, the evil emperor who betrayed him. The film prides itself on being an epic scale action film, using it's flashy showmanship and it's enticing bloodlust to disguise some of its dullness and its weaknesses in many areas.",

Is this old man Marcus Aurelius,the warrior-philosopher-emperor?I don't think so.He spend his reign constantly fighting to defend and expand the empire.He never finished fighting actualy.Rome was not out of enemies.The Picts in northern Britain,the Germans in the North,the competitive Parthian Empire in the East and the restless Arab raiders in the South hardly left him any piece.And this movie claims it was all for nothing and that a republic could be better?Absolutely not? Who the hell is Grachus?Pertinax was the next emperor and he was an army officer not a man of the declined Senate. And about gladiators they were not only slaves.Many of them were free man who were searching for glory,fame and most of all money. Why does Hollywood have to ridicule history?And what a false praise to Republics.The Roman Empire survived with its original capital between 27 Bc and 476 AD and continued to survive without it.What Rebublic ever survived 503 years?This movie is a disgrace considering it's plot and it's messages.",

These movies were good for reasons other than their special effects and their director and stars.

592,15 January 2001,raymond-15,8, Vivid action enthralls and repels in bloody combat,"Severed heads roll across the screen, blood spurts from torn torsos and the clash of steel swords keep the action going in a frenzy of gladiatorial combat.  Film buffs who like plenty of action will find it all here and will especially admire the courage and determination of the greatest of all the gladiators, Maximus, a general who brings glory to Rome when he fights and wins the battle against Germania. Russell Crowe who plays Maximus wields a mighty sword against terrible odds.  Maximus through his agility and experience and working to a plan is able to decimate his attackers however many surround him  When the dying Caesar promises that the General Maximus should take over the control of Rome, the choice of candidate is not popular with Caesar's son who promptly sets about the slaughter of his wife and little son.  Russell Crowe shines as an actor in the scene where he discovers the body of his wife hanging from a tree.  This is a scene filled with emotion and heart-break.  The remainder of the story concerns the avenging of this cruel deed.  Those who dislike the sight of blood will have to close heir eyes many times during this film.  The arena scenes are extremely well done on a broad canvas with sweeping views of blood-hungry spectators screaming ""Maximus! Maximus!..."" The supporting actors give very creditable performances as they get caught up in the intrigue and dirty tricks department of imperial Rome, but all eyes of course are on Russell Crowe as the sweaty gladiator, man of courage, man of action, hoping, as we all hope that good will triumph over evil.",

The story makes no sense.  There are big holes in it that bothered me so much I couldn't get involved.  The writer tries to impose mawkish modern sentiment on the Romans.  A Caesar, and Roman population, that want peace.  A Caesar who wants to restore power to the Senate.  A conquering general (from somewhere in the stix, who has never even been to Rome) who just wants to go home. Sensitive gladiators. Come on! Once you start seeing the failures of this film, the lack of artistry, the lack of creativity, even the lack of originality of the story (see ""Spartacus,"" for a start), you'll find little to like, nothing to admire.  Crowe is nice-looking fellow, very poorly cast for the role, and cast is the right word; he has only one facial expression, sort of a sad-dog face. The producers spent a lot of money, obviously, but none of it was on research. This might as well be set on a distant planet as in Rome. There should have been ewoks.

Joaquin Phoenix was also great as the villain, Commodus. Connie NIelsen and Djimon Hounsaou were also great in their roles.

But if there's one element that keeps this movie from being a great film is the lackluster special effects. The effects aren't all that great here. Even though they're not bad at all times, there were some effect shots that looked obviously phony. That shouldn't happen in a film like this.

The story unfolds like a Shakespearean tragedy: it concerns two men who are as close as brothers, one of whom betrays the other, trying to have him killed and slaughtering his family. Just as Ben-Hur became a slave, so does the protagonist here, with former General Maximus Decimus Meridius captured and sold as a gladiator, a situation he gradually starts to see as a means to gain revenge against the corrupt Roman Emperor Commodus, who betrayed him. The plot is relentless and remorseless, gradually building to an inevitable climax that sees both men die in a Hamlet-like climax.
It's all really rather traditional, and that is when it works the best. Gladiator has spectacle in spades with Ridley Scott impressively directing the film's many fight scenes. This is evident from the opening battle, where location filming, costumes, stunts, props, special effects and hundreds of extras combine to create an impressive whole. Critics have - as critics do - picked apart the film's anachronisms, both in the costumes and the Roman buildings on display, but they don't really matter enough to detract from a mise-en-scéne intended to invoke the spirit of epics from a different era of film making. Everything here is on a grand scale: John Mathieson's cinematography contributes a great deal to the epic feel of the film, with frequent use of panoramic wide-angle shots that show off the locations and battle scenes. The gory, brutal fight scenes in the arena include many close-ups, which draw the audience queasily into the thick of the action. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard's atmospheric score works well, even if it is so derivative that Zimmer was reportedly sued for stealing riffs from Holst's ""Mars: The Bringer of War"".
Even the acting is old school: method actor Russell Crowe plays Maximus Decimus Meridius with a more muscular, film star approach than he usually brings to his work, befitting the film's pedigree even if he's very naturalistic during scenes such as when Maximus finds the corpses of his murdered family. Joachim Phoenix entertainingly chews the furniture as Commodus and just in case he wasn't villainous enough, he makes incestuous advances towards his sister. Seasoned British and Irish thespians such as Richard Harris, David Schofield, Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed bring class to supporting roles, just as their countrymen did in Biblical epics during the nineteen fifties.
The problems lie with the characterisation and the dialogue: Maximus and Commodus are both fairly one-dimensional, and Connie Nielsen's sister Lucilla is little better despite Nielsen's commanding performance. Oliver Reed gives one last great performance as gladiator trainer Antonius Proximo, but he get saddles with some silly line such as ""you sold me queer giraffes"". The dialogue is often portentous and frequently pretentious and if frequently clunks; the characters are little more than extensions of the plot. Thus, Djimon Hounsou brings quiet dignity to the role of Juba, Maximus' friend and fellow Gladiator, but Juba doesn't ultimately actually do a great deal of note.
But this is perhaps churlish. If Scott was indeed intending to ape sword and sandal films he remembered seeing in his youth - as he has implied in interviews about the film - he most certainly succeeded. And the film is a technical accomplishment in its own right, with the Mill's special effects largely meshing seamlessly with the sets and location filming. The biggest special effect in the film was necessitated by the unfortunate death of Reed before he finished filming his scenes and although you can tell when he's been digitally resurrected if you are looking for it, for the most part the production gets away with it.
Gladiator does not boast the best screenplay ever written, nor does it boast the most interesting characters. But what it does do - and does well - is provide a then-modern spin on a classic Hollywood genre fondly remembered by its English director. It's impressive as a cinematic achievement but also as an example of the sort of spectacle that Cecil B. DeMille would have loved: in spite of its shortcomings, I suspect that it will be highly regarded for many years to come.",

I must have been over-influenced by reading the silly one-star reviews. This is an inventive and fictional tale, set in imperial Rome, with one or two actual historical characters. Unlike phony Braveheart, it in no way sets out to distort actual history. It is exceptionally skilfully directed, and the narrative never lets up. Ridley seems always to get the best from his actors. One of the least boring epics I've ever watched. Ridley Scott can turn his hand to any genre. Miles ahead of Kubrick: it's as if he is saying: I see what you're at, Stan, let me show you how to do it. Sometimes it steers dangerously close to excessive emotion, but time and again avoids bathos. Excellent script and dialogue. Visually masterful. Great movie.",

So, I didn't like ""Gladiator"" as much as I thought I would, but I still think it's a good film. It's interesting, the action scenes are great (the opening battle scene is reminiscent of both ""Braveheart"" and ""Saving Private Ryan""), the drama quite interesting, and the acting brilliant. Of course, Russell Crowe has never been better (I haven't seen ""The Insider yet, though), and we all know how good he was in e.g. ""L.A. Confidential."" Joaquin Phoenix doesn't play a very likable character, Commodus is a pathetic loser, but he does a good job with it anyway. Recommended. (7/10)",

Using modern visual effects, Gladiator shows us a Rome that hasn't been seen since, well Roman times.  There is a thriving metropolis and at the center of this mass of humanity is the coloseium.  Ridley Scott's films are wonders of art direction and costume design and Gladiator is no exception. The sumptuousness of Rome in its heyday is wonderful to look at.  With all of the eye candy that Scott gives you, you almost forget that there is a story unfolding, and it's quite a story.  Russell Crowe gives a strong performance as Maximus, the disgraced Roman general. Juaquin Phoenix is perfectly sniveling and underhanded as the newly crowned emperor Commodus. There are scenes of quiet treachery and intrigue and then there are scenes of blood stirring combat in the arena. Gladiator is an epic that spares no expense in giving you thrills from ancient Rome.",

Gladiator is a 2000 historical action/drama film directed by Ridley Scott, starring Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Crowe portrays the loyal General Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when the Emperor's ambitious son Commodus (Phoenix) murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murder of his family and his Emperor. While Gladiator was criticized by historians for its historical inaccuracies, its epic scope and intense battle scenes won praise. The film's success may have helped to revive the historical epic genre, with subsequent films such as Troy, Alexander, and Kingdom of Heaven, the last of which was also directed by Scott.",

Russell Crowe is commanding as heralded Roman war general Maximus whose moral compass is clearly fixated on family, strength and honor. His rescue from the dead is enthralling, if only to be enslaved as a potential Gladiator whipping boy. His story of revenge, catapulting him to the grand arena, seems as inevitable as his determination is contagious. Despite Crowe's Aussie accent and the pubescent and down-right creepy portrayal of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) all performances are come off empirical allowing the plot to develop, boil, and close with an every mans' belief of an afterlife, the soul of his mission.",

I must admit that I was not that impressed with Joaquin Phoenix at first, but on further review, I realized that he was actually very good... his character is a spoiled simpering evil dude, and he played it to the hilt, with a British accent (because we all know English was the language of Rome, and everyone who was anyone in the Roman empire spoke with a Royal Shakespearean accent).  Oliver Reed, Derek Jacoby, and Richard Harris were wonderful of course, as was Djimon Honshou, and then there's Russell Crowe... He is definitely the heart and soul of this film, and if THIS film doesn't get him the respect he's due, then nothing will. And anyone who thought the light saber duel in Star Wars Episode I was impressive (as I did -- my favorite part of that movie) will be completely bowled over by the fight sequences in this film.  Very bloody, but very well choreographed and incredibly filmed.  AND -- this movie has a heart!  The characters are well-developed and the plot (yes, there's a PLOT too!) hinges on the relationships between them, not just on the action.  A great movie in all respects.",

I hadn't seen it in years and tonight was my first time watching it in Blu-Ray, which just elevated it to an even higher plane. All of the technical aspects of the film are wildly impressive. The costumes, the sets, the score, the cinematography in particular was an astonishing achievement. So many shots felt like they were paintings, the actors working on some master artist's canvas. Ridley Scott crafts an epic tale of the warrior Maximus, but it's interesting how intimate the sets themselves are. The battles take place within arenas and almost the entire film is in dark hallways, cells or rooms within large structures. Even the big battle scene that opens the film is on a small field, yet Scott is able to give the film such a grand scope. It speaks a lot to his skill as a director.",

Anyway, I thought the movie was okay. I don't think I'll ever forget it, but it wasn't that good. What I like was the sense of masculinity I felt while watching it. The costume design was awesome, the score was good, and the set decoration was also good. But the cast was sort of boring, the characters didn't have a sense of humor and all of them were always bitter and they all act the same. Russell Crowe did a good job though. I thought Joaquin Phoenix's character weeps and wines too much; how could a great cesar raise someone who's the exact opposite of him? And how come he is always kissing everyone? And the battle scenes could've been better. I didn't enjoy them too much because they're built on messy close-ups of blood rather than strategy. No one in the audience could tell what's going on during the fight scenes because the camera was always pointing in the wrong direction and when it was pointing in the right direction, the scene would change chaotically. For example, when the horses on the chariots kept crashing, I was too busy trying to figure out why they're crashing instead of enjoying it. And the sound kept skipping too! I thought HOLLOW MAN should have won best visual fx instead. But who cares!",

The things I didn't like about this movie were the slow-motion scenes and the heavily edited fight scenes. That's honestly it. Moving on to what I did like, one thing that immediately stood out to me was the set design and costume this felt similar to GoT to me in the sense that I really felt like I was there and that I was watching a historical piece.

653,2 December 2007,jeremy3,10," I thought this would be just a blood fest, but I was wrong.","For the last seven years, I heard many people rave about Gladiator. I put off viewing the movie, because I thought it would be just another gore fest. I was wrong. This movie has a great plot and great heart to it. It doesn't sugar coat life in ancient Rome. Rome an assume civilization, but it also was one of great brutality. Life was very hard. Russell Crowe was excellent as a hero who was pure of heart. He could fight and defeat the best of them, but he never did it out of sadism. His character, a Roman general, was a bit naive actually, and believed in ""good intentions"". Unfortunately, he is up against the amoral son of the Roman Emperor (Richard Harris), who is all into macho-ism, but never has really been on a battle field or in the gladiator ring. That makes the son (Joaquim Phoenix) filled with spite, fear, resentment, jealously and hate for all that the Gladiator-General (Crowe) represents. The hero is all about bravery and valor, but not out about playing politician and hurting people out of spite like the Emperor's son was. I really liked this movie a lot. It was very well acted, very well filmed, very realistic, and also portrayed how hard and brutal life was in the Roman Empire. It was also Oliver Reed's last role. He plays an Arab or African owner-leader of the ""Gladiators"". He can be brutal and ruthless, but develops a heart when he sees that the hero is really standing up for the ""common man"", and not just a ""coward"".",

This is one of the best epic movies I've seen to date. You'll see the ""glamour"" of the Roman empire, one mans quest for revenge, and fantastic filmaking at it's best, with an awesome score to accompany it all (Hanz Zimmer). Even the soundtrack is great. When I first sat down to watch this film, I was taken aback by the brutality of the opening sequence, but I hung in there and I am so glad I did. If it was Ridley Scott who cast Russell Crowe in this, he should have won best director...(well he should have won anyway). First, the bloody scenes were fearfully realistic, the costumes elaborate and detailed, and the special effects astounding. The Colosseum crowd CGI created yet unknowing to the naked eye. This movie has all the elements of a great epic, war, battles, love stories, tragedy, ""strength and honor"", integrity, beauty, and it deserved every Oscar it received. Russell Crowe's acting was and remains some of the best I've seen on the screen so far. His response to his loss was heartbreaking, and his quest for vengeance, intense and heart pounding. With his change in status, he never changed his ""character"" and his performance shows it. Russell Crowe deserved that Oscar, and I applaud him. Connie Nielson was an unusual choice, but she got it and deserves honorable mention. This was also one of Richard Harris' greatest choices, he was made for the role of an emperor, we lost a great actor with his death, as we did with Oliver Reed as Proximo, the slave owner and former Gladiator. Another ""newcomer"" Djimon Hounsou as Maximus' friend and fellow slave/gladiator was a wonderful surprise, he was enjoyable to watch and likable...it would be nice to see him again on the silver screen. Joaquin Phoenix was another wise pick for the young emperor, we see what a fine actor he is in this film and his great potential. We know that because we hate him in it...and kudos to him for eliciting that emotion from the viewer. If you watch this film, you'd be hard pressed to find fault with it. It's so spectacular, emotionally charged, and full of talent. I still find myself listening to and loving the song ""Now we are free"" by Enya (played during the final scene in the Colosseum with the sad yet triumphant ending) When asked or discussing movies, I usually mention this one as my all time favorites, as ""new"" as it is. My only regret is that with the ending as it was, there is no room for a sequel (however although a sequel would unlikely be as great, it would have been interesting at least) This is a movie you've got to see, people will be talking about it and viewing it for years to come...don't miss it..10/10!!!",

I believe that when I read  that Ridley Scott (Thelma & Louise, G.I. Jane) was directing it I knew the movie had to be good. I knew nothing about Russell Crowe ""Maximus Decimus Meridius,"" Who is the Gladiator himself, perhaps because his name was not all over the place as it is now, I have movies that I am watching and I go? : Russell Crowe! The movie at hand is romantic, full of good principles and ""biceps"" combined with great fights. I enjoyed the movie very much. I am trying to leave people's private lives outside their work. I thought that Russell deserved the Golden globe nomination that he has received and wish him the best in his career and private life as well. The Gladiator brought to mind many Biblical Characters, such as  David, Saul, and specially  Daniel. The movie was awesome! Favorite Scenes: Russell's hands passing through the tall grass. Really cool images. Favorite Quote: Juba: ""Can they hear you?""  Maximus Decimus Meridius: ""Who?"" Juba: ""Your family. In the after  life.""  Maximus Decimus Meridius: ""Oh yes.""

661,6 May 2000,arvindms,5, Predictable melodrama,"I'd been looking forward to seeing Gladiator, since reading a review in the TIME praising it to the skies. I was disappointed - the story did not touch my heart. I think ""BraveHeart"" had a much better story and characters. I did not feel much empathy for the characters and the love story left me cold. The endless chit chat between the ""Roman"" characters was so boring with the dialogues utterly ordinary. The special effects were ok, but nothing extraordinary. Similar melodramatic stories have been seen by me ( as I from India) millions of times before. Wife, sister, parents, brother or son murdered and the hero taking his revenge. I would advise others who are praising the movies to the skies to start watching Indian movies. They will really lap it up. I also found the ending a big let down. The climax was so meek !! And I here I was expecting a big showdown between the the armies of the rebels and the emperor. Russel Crowe has acted well, but I believe any of our homegrown Indian superstars can give him a run for money in the melodramatic and action sequences. I found Joaquim Phoenix and the lady awful. The Gladiator isn't awful, but it's not particularly memorable either. You may want to see it to satisfy your curiosity, but not if you're concerned with getting value for your money.",

The strongest parts of this Ridley Scott film are the excellent fight scenes and the performances of veteran actors Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, and Oliver Reed (who died during the filming).  Only the appearence and design of Rome look very grainy and unpleasant.  I have some doubt why this movie received some Oscars that included Best Actor (Crowe, no offense) and Best Picture.

The movie kind of falls, at least for me, when the film try's to be moving and heartfelt, luckily those moments aren't too frequent and as I said the action manages to remain interesting throughout. The cinematography is pretty good and I really liked Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the pathetic, childish villain, Russel Crowe also gets a good performance in too. The sound design was slightly cheesy towards the end and I thought that family aspect, without getting into spoilers, wasn't given enough time to make me really care about it.

There was a only one part of this movie, that really got to me. And that was heartless merciless murder of his family. I broke into tears, but despite that depressing scene.

Having seen several old movies like Spartus, I knew that these movies would require you to get into the mood for them to really enjoy them. And it seemed that all these years later and several failed attempts later I finally got around to viewing it. All I can say is that it truly was worth the hype when it came out and after all this time it still has not lost its shine as it still has the ability to entertain us. Ridley Scott set out to give us an epic and thats exactly what he had managed to do. I can't think of anybody else who could of done a job to the quality of Russell Crowe although if you pay close attention you can hear his Australian accent a bit. Joaquin Phoneix him-self was marvellous along with Oliver Reed, along with Derek Jacobi and Richard Harris , they were nothing short of mind blowing. The script was sharp and tight not to mention the costumes, make-up and various other things that made the whole experiences breath taking. The music alone is worth a purchase and it adds a certain haunt to the point where one really does want to cry. To conclude Gladiator for me is a bit like a Porshce Carrera GT , if you put the effort into watching this then I promise it is a form of pure escapism rather than entertainment.

This movie has seriously been overrated by everyone. Sure, it ain't bad, but it's not much better than movies like Mask of Zorro, Star Wars etc. But the critics raised this movie to incredible heights, saying it was a masterpiece. Well, this movie's no masterpiece at all. What makes it disappointing are its simple characters and simple story. We've seen this kind of plot a hundred times before. Strangely, this movie kind of reminded me of the Zorro movie, which i think is a better movie. That movie also had a fight at the end between the hero and the bad guy, and somehow i liked that scene better. Although we knew who was going to win, it was much more exciting than this one.

688,21 November 2006,general-melchett,10, Ridley Scott's best ever film!,"Gladiator was a truly amazing film. Aside from beating LOTR on the visual and action scales (well, in my opinion), this film really recaptures the Roman era well, and is far more than just standard sword-and-sandal fare - it has a complex story, a complex script, complex characters and complex situations. The character of Commodus was done best - his spite, cunning and villainy was brought to the screen well by actor Joaquin Phoenix. Russell Crowe's Maximus was also a well-played and strong character, and one that you really felt for and understood - his humanity, love and sacrifice made him a true cinema hero. This is Ridley Scott's finest hour - his true talent is historical action films (Kingdom of Heaven is also one to be reckoned with). The best ever sword-and-sandal epic made! 10/10",
689,15 May 2000,Brogan,8, Speculator!,"Leave it to Russell Crowe, one of the few actors who actually reads a script for a movie before acting in it.  He has been in two of some of the best movies of the 1990's, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and THE INSIDER.  Now Crowe proves his marquee star status with his latest film, GLADIATOR.  GLADIATOR is a film in the tradition of BEN HUR, EL CID, and TEN COMMANDMENTS, a classic epic brought into the new millennium. The story is about Maximus (Russell Crowe), a Spanish general fighting for the powerful Roman army.  He is hailed a hero among his soldiers, and admired by his leader, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris).  Marcus adores Maximus so much that he would rather see Max, than his own son, Commodus (Jouquin Phoenix) become the future leader of Rome.  Commodus is both hurt and angered by his father's decision, he kills his father, imprisions Maximus, as well as threatens and torments his beautiful sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen).  Maximus escapes Commodus soldiers and discovers that his family is killed and his home is destroyed by Commodus' army. Maximus is then captured and is sold into slavery to become a gladiator, under the rule of Proximo (the late Oliver Reed).  Maximus befriends another slave, Juba (Djimon Hounsou), and together along with Lucilla, and Roman senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi), they try to defeat the evil rule of Commodus. From start to finish, GLADIATOR is a feast to the eyes and brain.  This is the kind of film that snaggs a couple of Oscar nominations.  Ridley Scott not only proves that he can make a fantastic movies that are in the future (ALIEN & BLADE RUNNER) but also the past, with this film.  From start to finish, and over 150 minutes, Scott manages to makes this film entertaining. With the excellent cinematography, editing, and fight scenes, Scott makes this a unique film placed in the history of cinema. And the acting is also great.  Russell Crowe is excellent, as usual, in his leading role as the faithful and honorable Maximus.  Now maybe, Crowe will become a popular star that he deserved to be since QUICK & THE DEAD.  And Jouquin Phoenix is very vicious and cold as the evil Commodus.  He proves that he can live up to the status that his older brother was in.  Connie Nielsen and Richard Harris are both great as the royal family. And in his final role, Oliver Reed is great as Proximo, the former gladiator who fight his way to freedom. GLADIATOR is a film that both the young and old will enjoy. The old will enjoy it since it's in the same formula as the classic epic film is, and with the great acting.  And the young will enjoy it because of it being so bloody and violent.  But anyone who enjoys brain food with thier summer films will enjoy this film.  Don't miss it!  ***** (out of five)",
690,8 February 2009,HelloTexas11,7, entertaining Roman epic,"Aside from its graphic violence, 'Gladiator' is quite the old-fashioned movie; you may even feel you've seen more or less the same story many times before. The plot certainly seems right out of Roman Film Epics 101 as all the reliable ingredients are there. Credit director Ridley Scott and star Russell Crowe for making the familiar appear so fresh again, crafting an intriguing if not exactly mesmerizing film, winning five Academy Awards including for picture and actor and achieving great popular success at the box office. Perhaps enough time had passed for a really good gladiator flick to click with audiences, or perhaps today's crowd has never seen 'Spartacus' or some of the others. For whatever reason, they turned out in droves to see 'Gladiator,' just as the people of Rome turn out to see Crowe's Maximus defeat foe after foe in the arena. Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the 'last good emperor' of Rome, chooses Maximus to be his successor over his own son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The son discovers this and kills his father before the succession can be announced and proclaims himself emperor. (Already, you can see where this is going.) Commodus of course is a weak figure, full of despicable traits, including having the hots for his sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). All sorts of conflicts and political intrigue ensue before finally, Maximus and Commodus meet in the arena for a death match. Guess who wins, despite having been mortally wounded just prior to the contest. 'Gladiator' may be the most 'mainstream' film Ridley Scott has ever directed, very straightforward in its storytelling and without as many quirky touches as most of his other movies. Crowe, Phoenix, Harris, and Nielsen all deliver good performances, Crowe in particular winning the audience over, again, just as Maximus does in the movie itself. While there is nothing really remarkable about 'Gladiator,' it is solid entertainment and does not seem nearly as long as its running time suggests, which is always a good thing.",
691,28 June 2013,Ziya90,10, A milestone historical epic which has been overlooked in time,"Despite, I've been affected negatively by comments like it is overrated or it was not that great in the past, after thinking about it once more, I conclude that Gladiator is a great film. The opening sequence of the movie was remarkable, the bird, Russell Crowe's hands over wheat and the action as a preparation for us. The movie is a first rate historical epic with the help of Ridley Scott the master's craftsmanship in technical aspects such as editing, art direction and the spectacular action scenes. Also great entertainment. The musics are of course fiery and enthusing. The movie is may be too showy at times, but isn't this natural for a movie about gladiator games? It is an effective and impressive film. Russell Crowe is the star of the movie, literally too! He steals the show, but Phoenix is great, a great villain, too. He is unforgettable like the movie itself. Also, you can see the actor who played Conan in the TV series (at that time, I was almost a child) In terms of everything, but especially story telling, Gladiator is much much better than his latter film Kingdom of Heaven. The forest scene at the beginnings requires a little too much suspension of disbelief, but in the end, it was necessary, because there was no other way to do that. The story might be cliché for some, but I think, it was powerful and solid to keep the film throughout. The story editing is a real epic! It is one of the main reasons that make the film a masterpiece in the genre. When I watched the movie for the first time at theater, I was seriously disappointed when I saw the combat area, but then realized that it wasn't The Colosseum when the real movie starts! The CGI was perfect at that time, as I know, it was one of the movies that an improved technology was used for the first time. ""Are you not entertained?"" scene is thought- provoking. The first battle in The Colosseum is worthy of cinema anthology. An unforgettable, iconic, spectacular sequence by Scott! I have no idea how many times I have seen this sequence! As action, may be it is the one of the movie. The craft in this sequence is breathtaking. The tiger sequence is another iconic, unforgettable and well executed part of the movie. In the year, 2000, at theater, I found that masked guy very interesting. The climax of the film was not as climactic as I'd expected, what can I say, I found it a little bit low key, but still a ""deserving"" final. Gladiator is one of the greatest historical epics so far.",

Before his death, the Emperor chooses Maximus to be his heir over his own son, the wicked Commodus, played by Joaguin Phoenix, and a power struggle leaves Maximus and his family condemned to death.  The powerful general is unable to save his family, and his loss of will allows him to get captured and put into the Gladiator games until he dies.

Its about costumes from a road company production of AIDA and sets using Biedermier furniture instead of researching the period. Its about blurry filters over the lenses. Its about a pathetically boring music score and the use of huge suffocating close ups for emotional intensity. Its about blurry computer generated reconstructions and a cloddish leading performance.

694,31 January 2015,JaydoDre,9, A very solid movie all-round,"What is cool about Gladiator (besides a whole lot of things) is that it should not offend pro- or anti-Romans. There have been a number of big movies, almost since the beginning of movies, that put Rome into the evil category. This choice echoes from the popular anti-Imperial culture of the 20th and 21st century that favors freedom over unity and order. Sorry, I will stop if that sounds preachy, but the point is: Gladiator gives both sides of the argument and also shows that it is not about the bad and the good sides but rather the bad and the good in the individuals.",
695,20 June 2009,kyle-cruse,9, An epic worthy of Best Picture,"To my surprise, I've read several negative comments on this film, referring to it both as ""fluff"" and a ""Braveheart-wanna-be."" I found ""Gladiator"" to be a well-made, engaging epic and character study of Maximus (Russell Crowe), a general who becomes a fugitive and comes back to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge on the ones who killed his family. Maximus is a great character that many people can probably somehow relate to. This is Russell Crowe's best film by a long shot. In the same way that ""Braveheart"" taught us that ""Every man dies, not every man really lives,"" this film teaches us that ""What we do in life echoes in eternity,"" an equally compelling message that resonates both during and long after the movie is over. The film's unique way of depicting the afterlife (which I won't give away here) is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, and the flashbacks between eternity and the battle scenes toward the end are due to Ridley Scott's superb job of directing this film. It's not completely flawless as ""Braveheart"" was, since I could have done without a particular murder sequence and a few of the battle scenes which are a bit repetitive. Nevertheless, I give this film a high recommendation. ""Gladiator"" will entertain and engage you, giving you a lot to think about when living your life.",

Excellent historical locations, a superb story, great acting and really exciting action scenes. The Gladiator is a story about men, revenge, honor and bravery. And it's perfect in every way. You couldn't find a more masculine character than Maximus, and this character fits the great story perfectly. Good job, Russel Crowe. It was also interesting to see Ralph Moeller as one of the gladiators. The first battle in Germania is especially awesome. I guess it's one of the most well made battles in movie history. The only slightly negative comment I have about this film, is that the ending is a cliché and too much of a Hollywood ending. But that's easily forgotten in this true masterpiece.

There's armies in combat, there's a father and son drama, there's gladiators (no duh, in a movie called Gladiator), there are women in skimpy outfits, and by the end, more violence. Not that any of this is bad. You just need to know what to expect when seeing this 2000 Oscar winner for best picture. Oscar winner Russel Crowe plays Maximus, a general in the Roman army who is next in line to be ruler of Rome, as the rightful Emperor-to-be Commodous (Joaquin Phoenix) is bypassed by Caeser Marcus Arillias (Richard Harris) in his final attempt to bring back to the old republic. After the Caesar's death, Commodous orders the execution of Maximus, which begins the epic portion of Gladiator. By the end of the movie, scores are settled, more battles are won, legacies are sealed, and every man in the audience has seen everything he could have wanted. No romance here, so the ladies will have to rely on seeing Russel Crowe running around without much clothes on. The best performance for my money is by the late Oliver Reed, who died while filming was in progress. Reed plays an emotionally unattached slave trader who trains Gladiators to fight in Rome. The movie looks good, for the most part. The computer generated Rome leaves something to be desired however, as the buildings look metallic and cold and some of the people watching the Gladiators are out of focus and not wearing togas.

The only scene in the film that he actually made me believe was when he was speaking to Marcus about his home and how he didn't want to be emperor. There I was convinced after that... nothing. Joaquin on the other hand did a phenomenal job. He was ruthless and i literally couldn't wait to see what he would do next. To me he was amazing as Commodus. The fight sequences were a little drawn out but I feel that way about most fights in movies and they weren't bad but just a smidgen over done. The scenery was awesome and the sets had a great WOW factor to them but thats all that was really good about this movie. The ending ticked me off the most. I hate movies were from the beginning you know the main character is going to die. I mean why even bother with it? They should've at least had one of them live, maybe it would've made it better I don't know.

I won't go into the plot, but I will say it is nail biting tense, stunningly beautiful, very moving and even heartbreaking. If there's not enough action in this one for you, well then, you'll never be satisfied. I should mention the awesomely magnificent music score by the great Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. If you enjoy a great Epic film, then this is for you.",
704,21 October 2016,cdjh-81125,10, A Movie That Everyone Will Watch At Some Point,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is and always will be one of my all time favourite movies and I have a problem with anyone who calls this movie overrated. The story in this movie is simple but it works perfectly it allows you to easily get behind Maximus played masterfully by Russell Crowe. Russell Crowe is amazing in this movie he turned a simple character into a compelling and damaged character and he earned his Oscar I could not have seen anyone else playing this character. Joaquín Phoenix was also fantastic here he just is so perfect at making you despise him while also being able to understand his inner turmoil and motives. Thought this movie is much deeper than a bunch of Gladiator matches it is what many casual movie fans will watch this for and their filmed perfectly, Ridley Scott did an amazing job at filming these sequences they feel gritty and realistic. Both the physical and psychological warfare that goes on between Phoenix and Crowe is riveting to watch and always puts you on edge to see what either one of them will do next. You really feel like the crowd in the arena are the true enemy, as if they are the deciders of who will live or die and creates for some very intense sequences. The quieter scenes between Phoenix and Neilson really gives you incite into Commodus' mind you really see a whole other side to him and you see that he's not just a character for the audience to hate but a wounded broken man weighed down by the life thrown upon him. One of the greatest scenes in movie history is the ending to this movie it is just masterful, few times has a character arc come together so perfectly. The final fight between Protagonist and Antagonist is riveting you truly feel as if this is the decider and really showcases both their skills. When Maximus finally lets go and dies instead of feeling sadness you feel happiness that he has achieved what he had to and is now ready to be with his family once more and it is beautiful to watch. Djimon Honsous last scene is also beautiful it gives you one last chance to truly see how their friendship has blossomed. ",
705,12 September 2006,tlongmoody,9, took me away,"This movie is one of my absolute favorites. I loved Maximus, Commodus, and Lucilla. The plot was perfect, the violence appropriate for those times. I think that the character, ""Commodus"" was one we absolutely loved to hate. But, he was weak, and really only wanted to love, and be loved. I loved the fighting scenes, so realistic. Cicero was another one of my favorite characters. Always faithful to Maximus to the very end. He set things in motion for Maximus, when he contacted Lucilla. She paid him and thanked him. I think she loved Maximus, but it was not clear that they could actually be together, if he lived. Which brings me to the only part of the movie i would've changed. Maximus, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife;who will have his vengeance in this world or the next, should have lived.",
706,4 April 2005,arthurclay,10, The Ben-Hur of Our Generation,"Simply put it is the achievement of a lifetime for Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe. Crowe finally solidified his place in the acting community with this flawless performance and hasn't let up since. I will never forget the look on his face when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor he looked like he had been told he just won the lottery as I am quite sure he was thinking he was gonna get rear ended yet again. From start to finish you are awestruck with how great this masterpiece is. Ancient Rome never looked so good and the beauty and intense savagery is captured like water in a bottle. It also puts every movie that came out that year to absolute shame without doubt or question. It stands toe to toe with the best epic movies of all time, including Braveheart, Spartacus, and of course Ben-Hur which was by mine and many other accounts the best epic movie ever made. They put together the best cast Hollywood could assemble and knocked out audiences all over the world. Phoenix puts on a great show and certainly deserved the acclaim given him for it I was disappointed he didn't win an Oscar but very glad he was nominated.

731,24 August 2000,Bert-82,1, Big disappointment,"My nephew, Matt (10 yrs old), summed up the picture very well when he said as we were leaving - ""That Roman Emperor was REALLY whiney"". There is a problem inherent to all gladiator movies - people come to see them for the fight sequences and not the plot. Not even Stanley Kubrick could surmount that problem (which, in reality, is a studio problem i.e. the grafting of studio morality, storytelling and themes onto a foreign stock). Thus we have a VERY long movie, full of fight sequences, and when there is no fighting there are certainly people trying to tell us about IMPORTANT themes that appear nowhere else in the story. Then there is that studio morality thing. Rome is not America. Neither is the conflict between Imperialists and Republicans one of freedom (both sides wanted slavery). And, in the end, what is the story about. Nothing but a pathetic and rather far-fetched Hollywood revenge fantasy.",

Every song scene you felt some sort of emotion that wanted you to watch on to know more about what will happen. Phenomenal acting and performances. I would consider one of the best films. It makes the movie even better that it's loosely based of true events. The character build for all of the was perfect. Each character had a background that was told and each one you could feel their pain whether you've been through somewhat something like that or haven't come close to experiencing it. Long but amazing watch. Perfect amount of time. I can't really think of any faults but if there were any they were with small or the scene was that good.

Then I burned a hole in my DVD afterward. Ridley Scott proved himself once again to be one of the greatest directors of all time, and this movie helped me to discover Hans Zimmer as well. I also think this is Russel Crowe's definitive role, and Joaquin Phoenix's performance absolutely floored me and turned me into a huge fan of his. Just a fantastic movie, with an absolute heart break ending. The recreation of Rome gives you the feeling that you are really there. Some of the cinematography, such as the scene where Commodus is looking out over Rome, just before screaming to his sister ""Am I not merciful?!"" is just unforgettable. Hans Zimmer's score is absolutely unbelievable and I've basically burned a hole in the soundtrack CD as well.",

742,18 May 2001,Bil-3,9, **** 1/2 Excellent return to sword-and-sandal epics,"Ridley Scott's best film in years is this astonishing epic of Roman proportions about a great general (Russell Crowe) who is demoted to gladiator slave when the kindhearted emperor (Richard Harris) dies and his selfish and callous son (Joaquin Phoenix) takes over. The plot moves smoothly over its vast size without stopping for a second, climaxing in excellent fight scenes that combine state of the art sound effects with Scott's unbeatable visual flair. Crowe gives a star making performance as the lead, and Connie Nielsen stands out in a pretty ineffective role as the princess who must watch her brother destroy everything her beloved father worked so hard for. One of the most exciting films of the year.",

(This is in contrast to Ben-Hur, which is all spectacle.)

Crowe gives his best ever performance, and is the perfect portrayal of a leader- calmness in eyes during planning, intend while attacking and ruthlessness in killing, and a man who lost his family- haunted by memories of his wife and son. Joaquin gives a stirring performance as Commodus. The subtle hinds of mental insanity, raw lust and incest adds to his mysterious nature, with the hatred to him increasing steadily through the movie. Connie Nielsen as Lucilla gives a steady performance, but the portrayal of her fear of Commodus is outstanding. The emotional scenes- between Aurelius and Maximus, Maximus' first battle as a gladiator and the climax sequences- could have been overdone by glorification of the hero, but Scott does an immaculate job in creating the feeling in audience, probably by the portrayal of Maximus as any man, driven solely by his loyalty and purpose above desire.",

But after sitting through 2 ½ hours of a slow, unoriginal story, I could feel nothing but disappointment. ",
759,22 May 2003,Blade_Le_Flambeur,8, Epic Adventure,"Ridley Scott is a trustworthy director, and even though a couple of his movies (Hannibal, Black Hawk Down) aren't as great as his older ones (Alien, Blade Runner) he still manages to at least direct them good. Here, he takes the more Hollywood type of approach and uses camera style previously used in the 1998 feature Saving Private Ryan. What Ridley Scott understands is that to see the action, one must be in the action. He uses his this technique in Black Hawk Down with his rapid- fire photography of the battle scenes. In Blade Runner, the camera was constantly focused near Deckard. He carefully chooses his shots here and instead of just saying ""Okay, let's make it realistic"" he choses to be more detailed and shows beauty in the scenes. He should have won Best Director instead of Steven Sodernbergh. Unfortunately, John Logan and co's script ends up being mediocore at best. They are trying to dazzle the audience with a magnificent feast of old proverbs and tight dialouge, but it ends up being the typical cliche type of dialouge. Maximus is the hero, yes, but the writers smolder it in our faces showing how he can just take anyone on and still hold out well. The performances are first- rate, and even though Russell Crowe's performance was powerful it was not as good as his ""The Insider"" of which he truly should have won for. Did he deserve at least a nomination? Yes he did. In support is the always energetic and young Joaquien Phoneix as the deceptive and brutal son of the Emperor, who always seems to have a few tricks up his sleeve. His performances blends craftiness and muscular strength in a beautiful tense and even if his character is a bit cliche it's not noticeable. He should have beat out Benicio Del Toro. Also in the backround is Richard Harris as the wise and friendly Emperor Commodus who wishes for war to end. His performance masterfully builds off himself and his character, and he at least deserved to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. As Commodus's daughter, Connie Nielsen provides most of the emotional work but she's harldy in the movie. There are some masterful shots here of the towering (CGI) arenas and the interesting costume designs to build upon everything. Even if the script isn't too good, the rest of the movie adds up enough to be a somewhat enjoyable experience and still one of the best movies of 2000. 8.5/10",
760,14 November 2019,larosaj-26666,10, Still one of the best movies ever made,"Certainly the best in its genre. Crowe and Phoenix both give great performances as polar opposites. One as brave, noble and honorable as a man can be and the other as cowardly, wicked and evil as a man can be. Reed, Richard, Djimon, and Connie also perform well in their roles. The battles are truly spectacular. Crowe delivers one of the greatest lines in movie history when everyone realizes who he is. Fantastic story with many stirring speeches. Perfect directing by Scott.

What makes this movie great is the acting and the world according to Scott. The acting of the film veterans is just great and it holds this whole movie together.

773,11 February 2009,thefinisher_23,10, R.Scott is the most underrated director EVER,"Some films know not to take themselves too seriously. Gladiator is one of the few films that know it must take itself seriously. It sweeping story, epic action, unflinching villain, determined ensemble, involving story, and larger than life hero make this a classic film by more than one standard. Director Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Alien, American Gangster, Black Hawk Down, Thelma & Louise) has made many a great film but his ability to let his incredible visual technique tell his stories is by far an aspect that has made him a legend. The narrative itself is not lacking in anyway. In fact it might be the best one Scott has presided over. Maximus's rise from noble general, to broken man, to finally a valiant, defiant, righteous hero is beautiful, triumphant and heart-braking. Russell Crowe can embody any hero and here he take on a true superhero like persona. Senators, queen, and Roman citizens rally around him to bring down a suspicious emperor. To us though Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is much more than suspicious we see him as disturbed, perhaps perverted, certainly sadistic, evil, murdering, disillusioned son of Marcus Aurelius (whom he murdered when he found that Maximus was to be emperor). The battle scene at the beginning when Maximus's troops rout the Germanic tribes is hauntingly beautiful and glorious. Also worth noting is the solid display of the supporting performances. Connie Nielsen is stellar as Lucilla, a woman who is caught between trying to best her diabolical brother (whom she still loves because he is family) and trying to keep her son safe. The implied past relationship between her and Maximus adds to the stakes of the story. Derek Jacobi is well cast as a seasoned determined senator on the side of Maximus. Djimon Hounson and the later Oliver Reed are likable and identifiable as Maximus's gladiator allies. On the whole Gladiator is unforgettable, involving story whose characters move us. ",

The latter was not to everybody's taste, nor were the scenes in Elysium, but I thought both worked rather well, lending texture to what we were watching.

Carrying too much hatred, he relied on perseverance and faith to complete the challenge beyond himself. When a person is facing despair, the strongest desire for survival often erupts, and those who fall into the abyss for this reason are destined to be abandoned by history. Undoubtedly, the hero Max Simmons, the most perfect man I've ever seen except William Wallace in his brave heart, knocks his opponent down in adversity time and time again, just as he once fought bravely on the battlefield, He climbed from the bottom to the top.

I should have known better, after all this had happened with the narratives in Legend, 1492.., Black Rain and even in his superior works Alien and Blade Runner(and will happen again, like Peter Pan?). Hope however springs eternal, and with the casting of Derick Jacobi some comparisons with the sublime I, Claudius were inevitably and subconsciously drawn. How desperately in need of those comparisons was this dire cocktail of flashy, confusing gore and risible 'intrigue' performed by a collection of actors who, with a few exceptions, appeared to have recourse to one facial expression to express the gamut of emotions required of them by an infantile, ludicrous and totally implausible script which took 2 1/2 hours to deliver a plot which could have been written on the back of a postage stamp.",

784,12 May 2023,codygdietrich,4, Boring,"This is an incredibly slow movie considering the title is Gladiator. The entire plot is a solider, a general or whatever the Romans called that position, was betrayed by the new emperor and seeks revenge. This movie is 3 1/2 hours in tv and it is a political drama, nothing more. Since it is set in ancient Roman times politics did not involve money laundering, by most historical accounts it did involve some drugs of sorts and sex workers but those aspects seem to have been left out of this film and physical fights. There is no traveling in the movies so I do not see how it is an adventure and the action is minimal to the talking. The sad fact is there is little to no backstory to set up the characters and make you care about them and help you understand the motivations before it basically becomes a WWE grudge match. The customs looked good, maybe a little too clean and in good shape for gladiators, the scenery looked good, although the Colosseum did not look as big as it actually is. I have personally been to the Colosseum and it was larger than expected and did not disappoint, unlike this movie. I am still trying to figure out how someone can be crucified and burned alive at the same time, the fire used to burn them alive would burn the wood used to crucify them. I would not be thinking about how characters died at the beginning of the movie after the movie has ended if the storyline had been written better, ie having more to it to justify the 3 1/2 of tv air time it took.",
785,13 September 2004,CurtMan@LVCM.com,10," Powerful, Engaging, And Exhilarating Masterpiece","""Gladiator"" has some of the best elements I have ever seen in a film. This is an invigorating, passionate, potent, and beautiful production, in almost listless ways. The direction is near impeccable, chronicling a simple tale of injustice and revenge in such a powerful, under- standing, and reverent manner to both the trials and conflicts of Maximus and the oppressive, grandiose atmosphere of Ancient Rome. Russell Crowe's performance as Maximus is beyond brilliant, perfecting nearly every confliction, strength, and intensity his character possesses and experiences; his attitude is fierce, his movements suggest he is disturbed, and his actions prove he is ready to ""have his vengeance"", and Crowe provides everything he can to make Maximus one of the most compelling characters to ever grace the screen. Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus, Maximus's enemy and the man who has robbed him of virtually everything he once possessed, is vicious, brooding, and bitter, as he nearly perfects this antipathetic role, where we love to hate this villain, and root for Maximus to achieve his demise. Everything else, from the riveting, stirring, and flat-out indelible music, some of the most portentous and potent in film, to the dialogue between the characters, containing some of the most memorable lines (e.g. ""What we do in life echoes in eternity""), to the fast-paced, involving cinematography, to the incredible realistic look of the visual effects (One would never believe the audience in the Colosseum wasn't entirely there, or for that matter, the Colosseum!), and on and on and on. This is the quintessential revenge and Roman Empire story, executed in a near impeccable and rousing manner. A true sensation of film-making genius. **** out of ****",

Very surprised how much I enjoyed this film. Stars docked for excessive flashbacks to serve as emotional beats (okay, we get it, he misses his family) and that ending. Felt unfinished. Like what happens next? The flashbacks and cuts really give me sting 2000 vibes. Also the weird offhand comments about sex are big 2000 energy.

His adoption into the gladiator lifestyle is almost as intense and emotional off the battle field as it is on.  Where Braveheart called for the audience to laugh or be shocked by the images on screen, Gladiator carries a much more personal feeling to their battles (mainly due to the size), allowing them to rile up much more emotional steam that has ever been seen in a war epic.  A veiwer must wonder as they watch, is it right that I support the brutality, is it right that I am rooting for a man to kill another?  It's quite an emotional movie, wait until you see it.",

The characters have deep feelings and emotions, and are portrayed beautifully by a great collection of actors. Three, the script and the story sounds like Shakespeare.  While it is not, if Shakespeare were to have written a story about a gladiator, it would be this movie.    And finally, four, the action makes sense and makes you jump at the same time.

I went unto the movie theater with excitement.  All the reviews that I had read about this movie raved about it's perfect marriage of stunning action and well-constructed plot.  What I found was an unrepentent melodrama of the worst stripe.  The audience nearly boo-ed and hissed everytime the villain came on screen, and cheered heavily upon the protagonist.  The script for Spice-World has more depth, and certainly more well-rounded characters.  Oh well, I thought.  At least I could sit back and enjoy the eye-candy.  And to a very limited extent, I did enjoy the gladatorial combats.  The only problem is that 90% of those scenes were in the commercials that had been run excessively before the release. Other computer-assisted action sequences were quite terribly done, such as the opening battle and all of the psychedelic flashbacks.

Maximus is just an obedient general to the emperor Marcus Aurelius who has slaughtered many people in the name of the emperor, whereas Spartacus is about freeing the people born into slavery and the overall breaking of obedience to the ruthless masters, but I digress.

800,20 May 2000,dalton2,7, I was disappointed,"I heard and read that this film is a classic, and thus I expected a really great film. But it's not the case. This film has a serious lack of character development despite it lasts 2 and a half hours. Together with the character development, we can see a poor ambient development. We just see a huge coliseum and thousands of people computer-generated. Just that. We don't see closeups, we can't see the feelings involved, and we feel no empathy at all (for a good example of a well done job, see Kubrick´s Spartacus). The camera moves in the fight scenes are acceptable for films like Saving Private Ryan, set in a time where cameras did exist, but not for a Romans' film... They just seem to be used to make us more difficult to find goofs, and that is a dirty trick in a so expensive movie. Another point is the acting. The actors are not bad, but they don't look like people from the 2nd century. OK, nobody knows how they were, but I am sure they weren't like people from the 20th century. I mean, the dialogue, the way they move, the feelings they show. You can use the same acting and the same music in a film set in the Middle Ages and we wouldn't note the change. If we forget that Ridley Scott is the director and Steven Spielberg is the man behind the production company, we just have a mediocre film. I still can't believe that The Sixth Sense got no oscars and American Beauty took them all. Mr. Spielberg, you are rich enough yet, so please let talented people do their thing and stop your 'This is the greatest film ever' propaganda in a Microsoft style!
