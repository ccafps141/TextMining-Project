0,19 August 2005,hall895,8, A fascinating look at life in the big city,"Give a collection of great actors a great story to work with and you are likely to end up with something rather special. Such is the case with L.A. Confidential. The boldface names jump off the page...Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, James Cromwell and, in his first big-time role, Guy Pearce. And none of these big names are just mailing it in, here to collect a paycheck. They're all on top of their games, undoubtedly helped to no small extent by the wonderfully nuanced and utterly intriguing story.",/
1,11 June 2017,TheLittleSongbird,10, Superb film-making,"As a fan of mysteries and thrillers and who likes a lot of the cast (such a great one on paper), expectations were high for 'LA Confidential'. And 'LA Confidential' didn't disappoint at all, it is an outstanding film on all levels and should have won the Best Picture Oscar of 1997 and won more.",r

3,12 February 2003,Theo Robertson,7, Hollywood Wasn`t Ready For It,"Hard to imagine now but in 1997 many of the cast in LA CONFIDENTIAL weren`t well known . Kevin Spacey had an Oscar under his belt but hadn`t appeared in many starring roles , Guy Pearce was known only to NEIGHBOURS  fans while Russell Crowe was remembered only for his powerhouse performance in ROMPER STOMPER . In fact it sounds ridiculous in 2003 but the two best known members of the cast when this was released were Danny DeVito and Kim Basinger ",v
4,29 May 2010,blanche-2,10, The cast of a lifetime in a 1997 noir set in LA of the '50s,"One of the greatest films ever made, L.A. Confidential benefits from a great script (Brian Helgeland), great performances (Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger, James Cromwell, Danny DeVito, David Straithairn), and great direction (Curtis Hanson). It's not easy to do a film noir in modern times that is set it in the past. All too often, the performances are too stylized or nonorganic, the direction is stilted -- the whole thing comes off as an attempt, and not a very good one. In this case, though, the result is brilliant.",i
5,20 August 2012,Leofwine_draca,10, An exemplary piece of filmmaking,"What's not to love about L. A. CONFIDENTIAL, the 1997 Oscar-winning detective story about the sleazy side of seemingly glamorous '50s-era Los Angeles? It boasts an outstanding screenplay adapted from the James Ellroy novel, excellent direction from old hand Curtis Hanson, and truly tremendous performances from the entire cast.",e
6,3 February 2006,Mr_PCM,10, This is how a proper crime story should be told!,"LA Confidential is a sprawling epic tale of crime, corruption and justice in Hollywood and the LAPD, with a cast to match. A truly gripping crime saga exposing the seedy underbelly of the City of Angels, where cops never let the truth get in the way of justice, and everyone knows everyone else's dirty secrets.",w
7,30 September 2005,lee_eisenberg,10, a masterpiece in every respect,"I can always remember ""L.A. Confidential"" as the first gritty-noirish-seedy movie that I ever saw in the theaters. And it makes me proud that this was the first one that I saw. We all can assume that movies about the inner workings of the police world are going to be gritty-noirish-seedy, but overall, it doesn't do ""L.A. Confidential"" justice to only classify it that way. Curtis Hanson created an INDESCRIBIBLY great movie here.",/
8,19 November 2020,auuwws,8, L.A Confidential,"A wonderful movie and the performance of most of the actors was excellent and the development of Ed Exly's character was excellent and the ending was good. I did not expect the death of jack. The film discussed the issue of corruption among the police officers in an excellent way and the directing was very good and the writing was good, but at the end of the film I felt very bored",r

10,28 May 2008,bkoganbing,10, Eisenhower Era LA,"I think that all LA Confidential needed was possibly the writing touch of someone like Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett. But since those two worthy gentleman are beyond reach, this is as good as it will get for the modern cinema.",0
11,2 March 2011,redzon19,10," Rollo Tomasi, do you still remember?","""Rollo Tomasi"" is a name that anyone had seen this movie should remember for the rest of his life or at least be aware of the existence of the name, because this is the key to the spirit of this whole story. Due to the setting of this clue, there is no doubt one great movie had become a classic! ",4
12,17 February 2000,Bil-3,10, ***** Best Film of the 90s,"Hands-down my favourite American film of the nineties. Curtis Hanson shocked the world by proving to be not only a great director but an auteur with this unbeatable adaptation of James Ellroy's terrifying novel about corruption and crime among members of the LAPD in the 1950s. The hard-boiled detective story angle is brought to life so beautifully, mostly because Jeannine Claudia Oppewall's production design recreates the dark underside of the 50s to such perfection that not even a Coke bottle label is missed. Add to that Dante Spinotti's stunning lighting that rides the fine line between artistic and believable comfortably (as all period camerawork should), Ruth Myers' costume designing and a script by Hanson and The Postman scribe Brian Helgeland (I know, I don't get it either) that pares down Ellroy's mammoth plot about a multiple murder in a local diner involving a policeman with suspicious ties without sacrificing the density of the story or the spiderweb of events involved with it, and you have the best movie of 1997, not to mention the most fascinating detective film ever made since Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. The cast is all brilliant, most notably Kim Basinger as a wordly prostitute who has not only a heart of gold but a mind of steel--Basinger is so strong in her character's every nuance you'll find yourself forgetting she's even acting--and Kevin Spacey as a Dean Martin-esque detective who not only solves an important part of the puzzle, he even discovers he possesses a soul beneath his flashy suits. I just can't get enough of this film.",2
13,15 March 2005,trvpup,10," hard-hitting, smart movie","Although this movie 'flopped' at the box office at $53 million, this just may be one the smartest movies you haven't seen. With great performances from an ensemble all-star cast and a clever script, the dramatic tension of this modern film-noir classic is an absolute must-see! Told through a variation on the theme of ""good cop, bad cop"" with an overarching corruption angle, this film cleverly deals with issues of racism, social justice and ethics in a non-discriminatory manner. Character development is well-done and the dramatic tension is superb. If you are a fan of crime-drama and detective stories, you won't be disappointed!",2
14,3 August 1998,Buzz-17,10, Will stand the test of time.........,"When a film evokes an era as well as L.A. Confidential does, people take notice. It could be argued that it is easier to replicate the recent past than the distant on film,  and in a sense this is true. Costumes, language, and the necessary absence of the modern in ""period pieces"" make them expensive and difficult to film. But couldn't it be argued that it is just as difficult to make a film about more recent periods? I have no knowledge of how a Victorian era table was set, or what a knight really spoke like; we are subject to the directors view of reality. But what if a good deal of your audience lived through the time you are portraying, as in the case of the 1950's? I can even envision my grandfather coming back from WW2 to a booming economy, and living in the world Curtis Hanson created.",7
15,14 August 1998,Sickfrog,10, The Best Film of 1997,"Truly, one of the greatest mistake the Academy has made is not awarding this film the Best Picture award. For months, I argued that while ""Titanic"" was a nice spectacle with great special effects, the script, the directing and the acting was all rather mediocre. However, here we have ""L.A. Confidential."" Perfection in script. Perfection in directing. Perfection in cast. Obviously, because Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey all gave Oscar worthy performances, the voting was split, and therefore, none got enough votes for a nomination. ",1
16,11 January 2000,Giuseppe Giuseppe,10, Everything in this film is fantastic.,"L.A. Confidential is, without a doubt, the best film of the 1990s, and quite possibly one of the best films ever made.",1
17,27 November 2011,classicsoncall,10," ""Welcome to Los Angeles, the city of the future.""","""L.A. Confidential"" is the kind of gritty crime drama you can really sink your teeth into with compelling characters and a complex story that brings Los Angeles of the 1950's to life in a big way. You have to pay attention though, because there are a host of main players all vying for attention when they're on screen, and their stories intertwine involving hookers, a heroin racket, and corrupt cops all over the place. All of the principals are stand-out, so it's tough to single out any of the main players; all are on top of their game and convey their characters effectively. Guy Pearce looked like he might have been out of his league at the outset among actors like Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, James Cromwell and Kim Basinger, but his character grows throughout the story until he leads the final charge to take down the corrupt chief of detectives Dudley Smith (Cromwell). Comparisons to 1974's ""Chinatown"" are inevitable and are all over this board, so I won't dwell on the obvious. Of the two films, I'll take L.A. for it's even MORE intricate plotting and writing. The fictional Rollo Tomasi may have been inspired by the non-existent Keyser Soze, but since we knew that up front, we see it utilized as the hook Exley (Pearce) uses to put two and two together. All in all, this is a masterful film and one of the best that doesn't quite crack my Top Ten List, but it just misses ever so slightly. Maybe if it had been done in black and white.",/
18,23 April 2017,Tweekums,10, Sleaze and corruption in the City of Angels,"It is the early 1950s and Los Angeles is a great city to live in; the police keep everybody safe and everybody has a chance of making their dreams come true at least that is the Hollywood version. The reality is less pleasant; cops are more than willing to rough up a suspect or plant evidence to secure a conviction and many who dream of becoming famous end up in vice. This story is centred around three detectives; Bud White, a man who is willing to get rough but won't tolerate those who hurt women; Ed Exley, an honest cop who would rather see a guilty man go free than break the rules; and Jack Vincennes, a celebrity cop who takes payment to make sure any newsworthy people getting arrested make the front page as well as working as an adviser for a popular police show. They end up working for a common purpose after a massacre in a local diner where one of the victims was a recently fired cop, White's ex-partner. Evidence points to a trio of black youths but evidence isn't always what it seems and the detectives soon start to believe they got the wrong people. As they dig deeper they uncover corruption in the LA Police Department, high end prostitutes who look like movie stars and the blackmail of city officials.",?
19,28 December 2019,K3nzit,10, Modern classic,"Not only the best Neo-Noir film ever made, it's also a modern classic and one of my absolute favorite movies. Acting is particularly impressive and many of the actors do their careers best performances.",r
20,5 August 2005,Pamsanalyst,10, It's in the writing,"Reading the comments, I find few viewers seemed to have read James Ellroy's LA Trilogy, on which LA Confidential is based. The Big Nowhere, LA Confidential and White Jazz comprise the Dudley Smith story; Smith is the only constant in all three. None of the heroes are in Nowhere, Buzz Meeks being gunned down by Dudley while trying to escape, having hidden the heroin. Buzz White survives Confidential along with Exley, and White does go off to Arizona, but Smith still lives and rides high. In Jazz, Ed Exley~~Guy Pearce~~and Smith do battle for the soul of David Klein, who in the end brings down Smith. Of the three, Confidential is surely the most complicated since with the heroin out there somewhere, many more players are involved.",e

23,15 January 2006,MaxBorg89,10, Essential Film Noir,"L.A. Confidential, one of the best pictures of the '90s (in fact, it could have won the 1997 Best Picture Oscar: it's so much better than Titanic), is the definitive proof that there is no such thing as an ""unfilmable"" book: Curtis Hanson (with the help of co-writer Brian Helgeland) has turned James Ellroy's noir masterpiece (which is 800 pages long) into a 135-minute long modern classic. It's THE noir of the '90s!",=

From review #490-499, this being 492, I revisit what I feel are classics from the 90s.

28,11 December 2013,A_Different_Drummer,10, At last -- an IMDb rating really close to what it should be...,"Whatta cast. Whatta movie. From beginning to end of the best cop flicks ever shot anywhere and while I gave it a perfect 10, the current IMDb rating (8.3) is pretty darn close. Crowe and Spacey, two Oscar winners in their own right, as cops, that's enough to make you want to sign up for the force yourself. The other reviewers are right, this film was CHEATED in all the awards categories that year; in decades to come, will viewers want to get seasick one more time on the Titanic -- a story where we know exactly what is going to happen before it does -- or will they want to watch this story unfold moment by moment..? To this reviewer the larger ""crime"" in this ""crime tale"" is Pearce. How good was he here as Exley? How hot is the sun? How high is the sky? He gave the single best performance of his life here and the buzz was that it would launch him into other projects...? But for some reason that never happened. Pearce did a few name films here and there (a forgettable remake of Monte Cristo for example) and even went back to AussieLand to pick up work there, but never again (sorry to say) flew the heights he flew here. Minute for minute and pound for pound, one of the best films of its kind with one of the best ensemble casts on the planet.",r

He often works with fame-whore narcotics detective Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) who also works as a technical adviser on popular TV show Badge of Honor. Sergeant Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is ambitious trying to live up to his murdered father's reputation. He testified against Bud White (Russell Crowe)'s partner. Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) doesn't believe he's tough or corrupt enough to be a real detective. Bud is rough cop out for street justice.

35,23 September 2011,itamarscomix,9, Thrilling and powerful,"Rewatching L.A. Confidential for the first time in 13 years, I was surprised at how much better it is than I remembered, and how much better it stood the test of time than other movies of its time, Se7en for example. It's a genre piece for sure - Curtis Hanson is not after originality, he uses every trick in the book and fills his film with genre clichés, but he does it so cleverly that those clichés seem fresh and effective like they haven't been in many years, subverting every expectation the seasoned viewer has, while never actually leaving or deconstructing the genre.",

So even though I am reviewing this movie 20 years after its release, I have not had the plot spoiled to me (though I'm sure I've seen movie that were influenced by it). I'm going to try and avoid spending too much time on the positives of this film because I think there are some pretty glaring issues with this film that have gone unnoticed.",
37,12 January 2010,Hitchcoc,9, The Fox Is Guarding the Chicken Coop!,"This is a great mood piece. It has a sense of time and place, not to mention some incredibly memorable characters. This is early Russell Crowe and he is really a movie presence. This has so many layers and yet it plays fairly. The people are multi-dimensional from James Cromwell, whom I love, to Kim Basinger, a really underrated actress. And, of course, Kevin Spacey is his solid self. I've seen so many portrayals of corrupt police forces and without a delicate touch, this could have been clichéd. It wasn't. We have a balance of show business and violence, drugs, you name it. We have an overzealous son of a cop who we start out hating and then begin to accept because he is driven in the right direction. I missed this the first time through during Titanic-mania, and I've always been turned off by the title (the tabloids of the fifties), but this doesn't fail to satisfy.",

It's a world where the bad guys are vicious and the cops aren't much nicer. I do hear ""overrated"" a lot (these days) when discussing this movie, and obviously, I don't agree; but I think we can all agree that this is one hell of an ensemble cast. Even when I want to single one player out above the rest, another steps up to refute that notion. Every single person is ideal for his/her character.

48,6 September 2013,Red-Barracuda,9, Neo-noir masterpiece,"L.A Confidential is an excellent neo-noir detective film. Set in the 50's heyday of the original noirs, it is able to recall the past while updating it for the 90's. The fantastic production design oozes period detail perfectly and captures both the Hollywood glamour but also the dark underbelly of L.A. The look and feel is one of its chief pleasures, creating an atmosphere and mood all of its own. The story is a typically convoluted murder mystery with the influence of the hard-boiled detective novels that inspired the original film-noirs. It's a very well controlled narrative which keeps the mystery enticing while introducing the characters brilliantly. They are a typical array of types you would expect to see in such films, such as the femme fatale and the cynical cop. But the beauty of the film is that it gives us the ingredients we are used to and want but fleshes them out in ways that makes it all feel very fresh.",

With one of the strongest plots I've ever seen, which is executed masterfully by Curtis Hanson, also has eye candy and sex appeal. The direction really is wonderful. The art direction is fantastic and brings you right back into the 50s. The acting is very good even if it comes off as 50s styled acting proving that todays actors are far superior than the actors of the 50s. ""L. A. Confidential"" even goes as far as poking fun at the sensationalized way films were made in that time period with a hilarious sequence where a cop on a show called, ""Badge of Honor,"" interrupts a women giving him details about some crime, and he says, ""Just the facts, ma'am.

The film is now a little forgotten, or at least I haven't seen it so much on TV specialized movie channels... but the fact is that it is a remarkable work of cinema, won two Oscars (Best Actress, for Kim Basinger, and Best Adapted Screenplay) and received nominations for seven more statuettes (Best Film, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Soundtrack).

Don't get me wrong, I still think this is fantastic cinema and I've adored the few James Ellroy novels I've read (L.A. Confidential is adapted from the third book of his 'L.A.

Crime-drama from director Curtis Hanson concerning police corruption and murder in 1953 Los Angeles is, much like its scenario, seamy stuff underneath a classy veneer. Kevin Spacey is the narcotics officer, Russell Crowe the investigating officer, Guy Pierce the new lieutenant, Danny DeVito well-cast as the gossip columnist, and Kim Basinger the hooker whose bosses figure in the crime spree and drug-trafficking. Overstuffed, overwrought, with nasty sideline details detracting from the intense narrative of cops-gone-bad. The picture certainly looks good, and keeps its momentum up despite a byzantine plot that becomes harder and harder to follow. Basinger won the Supporting Actress Oscar; the screenplay also copped statues for Hanson and Brian Helgeland, who based their script on James Ellroy's novel. The movie has punch--but doles it out in spurts. The first hour is best, and most of the ensemble acting is spot-on, but interest wanes once the story becomes too muddied up. **1/2 from ****",

Guy Pearce plays an underdog cop set to testify against other cops and their conduct. His father was a cop so he tends to do things by the book. Kevin Spacey plays an officer who allows his arrests of celebrities to hit local news. He reluctantly teams with Pearce to find answers involving a strings of murders. Russell Crowe is a good cop yet he uses interrogation to get information out of suspects targeted in an operation. Kim Basinger plays a prostitute who leads Crowe on and allows a picture taken of her involvement with Pearce. She is one of many women modelled after famous actresses. She is to represent Veronica Lake. Finally there is Danny De Vito as a sleazy editor for a show business tabloid containing celebrity gossip. They are all involved in a scheme where a trail of murders point to law enforcement. Expert directing by Curtis Hanson who previously made The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Bad Influence, but this could possibly be his greatest achievement. He achieves the necessary noir appeal underlining a theme about police corruption, and an underdog who stands against the masses and influences his biggest critics. The result is one of the year's best films. Score: 10 / 10",

My only gripe is the totally over-rated performance of Kim Basinger. Anyone could have played that part.  I always think that in order to win an Oscar there should be at least a moment of something approaching  memorable...where you can see why that person won...not in this case.  She added nothing to this movie; I thought hers was the worse performance in the movie (other than Danny DeVito, who was in another movie entirely).  Why wasn't Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and James Cromwell nominated for Supporting Actor?  Crowe could easily have won - he WAS that guy. Good, solid movie.",
75,24 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9, L.A. Confidential is noir crime executed to the highest standard.,"Well, I wasn't expecting that! I went in thinking it would be an overlong stylised drama with one or two scenes of detective work. Quite the reverse actually, it's entirety was an unsolved case. Three separate officers, each with their own motives, investigate separate aspects to a case which eventually interlink with each other. Let me just whip out the old crime checklist: Shootouts? Check. Detective work? Check. Corruption? Check. A plethora of twists and turns? Most definitely. The latter is what truly separates this from other similar crime stories, there are so many twists that are naturally executed. There isn't one moment where I thought ""Oh, that was a coincidence!"". All of these characters are fleshed out, each with a contrasting personality, where any decisions that are made just feel right. A serious straight rookie quickly climbing the ranks utilising his intellect. A tempered brute using his physicality to progress with the case. Then you have the suave experienced officer who uses his connections to get answers. Individually they work excellently, but as a unit? Even better. It plays out brilliantly because of Hanson's direction. Refreshingly switching between these officers and showcasing the 1950's L.A. lifestyle, he managed to create an environment that lives and breathes crime. One of the best casts I've seen from a 90's film. Crowe, Spacey, Cromwell and Pearce (arguably my favourite role of his) all brought grit and emotional captivation to their roles. The script is densely compact with development and taut pacing, although occasionally does dip. I did find Strathairn's character underused and didn't add much to the story. However, the focus is on the case, naturally including character development and thrills to make an outstanding crime thriller. I suspect this will eventually gain the perfect rating.",

In this world, nothing is quite what it seems, especially in 1950's LA. Performances are second to none and Guy Pierce, Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey bring lots of depth and complexity to these roles as these characters are brought to life. The film is beautifully shot and scored with period songs and Jerry Goldsmith's score going back and forth. The storytelling is excellent and is a great adaptation of James Ellroy's novel. LA Confidential holds up well and as far as crime thrillers go, it is one of the best with the right mix of action, suspense and a truly engrossing story with complex characters.

79,11 July 2016,NateWatchesCoolMovies,10, Triple homicide at the Nite Owl,"The finest Los Angeles film noir to ever come out of Hollywood, Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential is a serpentine wonder, a two and a half hour parade of hard boiled detectives, sultry dames and shady dealings, all wrapped up in a multiple murder story that kicks everyone's arc into gear, taking you places you didn't think you'd see some of these people go. 'Triple homicide at the nite owl', barks the headline of a gossip rag run by a sleazy Danny Devito, and indeed the crime scene has everyone buzzing, from the shirt tuckers in the highest ranks of the LAPD, to the burly brass knuckle wearers on the brutish task force. Something is amiss with the case, and Sgt. Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) is a dogged straight arrow with a nose for corruption. He isn't quite the formidable force needed to barge down certain doors or break certain bones though, and that's where Det. Bud White (Russell Crowe) comes into play. The two are initially at each other's throats following a cleanse of many of the department's corrupt officers, spurred by Exley himself. It soon becomes clear that they have no choice but to work together, in order to smoke out the evil source of the crime, which may be closer to home than anyone thought. Crowe and Pearce were not the stars they are now back then, but came up from the farm league in sensational style, barging onto the Hollywood scene in shotgun toting, sh$&t kicking style. Kim Basinger won an Oscar for her poised, complex turn as a call girl who works for a pimp named Pierce Patchett (a glib David Strathairn), an eccentric who pays surgeons to deck his girls out to look like movie starlets. My favourite performance in the film comes from a diabolical James Cromwell as Captain Dudley, a dangerous rogue who you don't want to cross for fear of his unpredictability. Kevin Spacey is all style and self loathing as Jack Vincennes, a media mogul of a cop who advises on TV shows and hogs the press limelight like a boorish politician. The supporting cast is all across the board, including work from Simon Baker, Graham Beckel, Tomas Arana, Ron Rifkin, Brenda Bakke, Jack Conley and an amusing cameo from Paul Guilfoyle as Mickey Cohen. Adapting a novel by the great undisputed king of LA noir, James Ellroy, Hanson weaves a deadly web of sensation, intrigue and steamy goings on that never follows a readily discernible pattern of narrative, and constantly has tricks up it's sleeves. Remember Rollo Tomassi.",

Though ""Mulholland Falls"" (the prior year's film which ""L. A. Confidential"" tries to ineffectively copy or spoof) is on my list at spot #125. ""Mulholland Falls"" is a much better film and I would recommend it instead; I know that's not the consensus but that is my belief. All I could think the whole time I was watching ""L. A. Confidential"" is why aren't I just watching ""Mulholland Falls"", why bother with a cheap imitation. While ""L.

Sure, its a recollection of film-noir, but it is without a doubt a 90's film. The 1950's are relived with great nostalgia and period set-ups, however, it is not the showcase of the film.

105,14 May 2007,DeathFish,9, Acivement in world class,"L.A. Confidential is perhaps, one of the best and most intriguing pieces of moving picture in the past few decades. The brilliancy of the script itself, deserves a standing ovation, because it is in my opinion, one of the most thought-out and nerve wrecking of its time. The direction by Curtis Hanson gives this intense and complex movie softness and makes a gentle approach to the audience, because none of the material is forced through, but instead it rests quietly in the subconsciousness of the audience the whole time. The plot is just awesome and stands out from any of the former (and later) police/criminal movies, because we get to experience the action behind the curtain, from a passive point of view. The plot has a great balance between tossing us into the action, and gently luring us through one mystery after another, trying to find the answers. The actors give the ideas of the script and the characters faces, and gives us a chance to relate and identify with the characters involved. Each of them delivers great performances: Spacey as always smart, sly and above all believable, though he does not exceed his brilliant performance in ""The Usual Suspects"". Crowe with his, so far, best performance in my opinion, with temper and depth. Pearce with an OK performance without really reaching the top, but fills out his character nicely. Devito is amusing and cool and does everything he can to contribute to this movie. Basinger with her Oscar-winning role, plays the beautiful blond convincingly and spices up the last aspect of the movie, with splendor and depth as well. Alltogehter this makes one hell of a good movie. Fast, smart, complicated, exciting, raw and above all believable and entertaining. Well done by the creators of L.A. Confidential.",

Although they are not wrong in their comparisons, LA Confidential should be taken as a great film in its own right. A movie like this has a plot so well woven, with acting to support, and a cast that will blow you away, that it can't help but stand out. Everything from the great acting to the fantastic direction to the remarkable screenplay (which contains some truly great lines... ""Go back to Jersey...""), is so perfectly executed that I find it amazing how studios consistently release such mediocre junk these days when they could elect to finance films like this. Gritty homage to film noir about three detectives, Spacey, a big hotshot T.V. police adviser, Crowe, a defender of women against abusers and Pearce, an ambitious yet naive detective are involved in a complex case of sex, scandal, and murder. Strange, fascinating mystery in the best Hammett/Chandler tradition is vivid and atmospheric, all thanks to the superb cast including Bassinger, who richly won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar as the Veronica Lake-ish fem me fatale who's surrounded by her Oscar-worthy costars including Cromwell as the police captain who's more important than you think. Directed by Hanson, who with Brian Helgeland won a well deserving Best Adapted Screeplay Oscar. A modern masterpiece of film-making based on James Ellroy's novel. The movie plays out like a series of events that seem to be separate but is eerily connected, and a plot like that holds the most commendment I can award a film with. This movie totally kicks Titanic's butt! This should have won best picture (just my personal view). It had an excellent story, acting, and set design. All in all it has something for everybody, action, romance, comedy, suspense, mystery, crime, drama and anything you name it.",

Did it seem like there were some major character-disconnects? It felt that a bit - there were moments in the story when the plot was more like a disorganized smattering of unruly lice than some kind of a storyline. Was it too long? Again – time is relative and – for me – this show was relatively too long. Predictable? Oh please – this was your typical bad cop vs. badder cop vs. baddest cop. I might be too hard on this flick – I don't know. I am probably spoiled by some of the quality TV crime drama (you know – the ones that have good writers and last an hour). LA Confidential was just not a spectacular tale, it was almost boring. Don't get me wrong – this is not a bad movie – it is actually pretty good – it's just not great. To put it another way, L.A. Confidential, is like a Chevy Corvette outfitted with a Vespa engine all flash and no guts. I apologize to those who loved the movie, but I won't lose sleep over it.

But this movie shows up is the limit and what is right and wrong in order to get the job done and taking down the bad guys. This is noir done right with some great storytelling. It really does get down to the dirty aspect to the police force back in the early 50's and has enough grime and grit to intrigue most audiences that is into this type of genre. Even if your not into this types of genre, it's still a movie that should be watched by anyone at least once. The story revolves around 3 police offices one who is a smart and yet not willing to bend when it comes to the law no matter what and is a bit of a snitch. Also sometimes he comes off as a character that cares about the image he thinks up for himself than actual integrity. The second is a hot tempered cop that is willing to get his hands a bit dirty in order to get the job done and unleashes his own person justice. The third is a selfish cop that only care about himself and nothing really matters as long as he reaps the benefits and there is a payoff. The movie will have the audiences attention because it's entertaining with it's intelligent investigation and put together well without it being way too convoluted, the way it's all connected is integrated in a way where you can't help but pay attention to what is going on. And the audiences are going to have to pay close attention to the investigation to get the most out of this movie. The dialogue is also sharp and the acting performances are the same as well. I was looking forward to seeing how every piece of the of puzzle is gonna be made at the end. And the ending is good and the puzzle to the investigation is put together almost brilliantly.

The case is just an excuse to see that even if the investigations are interesting and to know who killed Sue. We see also that young fresh lieutenant become more and more though because of his new job. It also remind me of the video game of rockstar games:. L. A Noire. Sometimes its pretty cliché but i like also how they play with the way we supposed to see Los Angeles like a city of dream but the events are far from dreams. And i enjoyed that kind of perspective. We have also talks about Justice, corruption, sex and blackmailed. Its pretty interesting to see also the three policemens will understand that Smith is corrupted and cant trust him and how they will put their personalities to work together and confront Smith with his crimes and his corruptions but the reputation of the police department will take more importance and they will lie about the real corruption about Smith and that is pretty frustrated to see this because we know what he did and will not have any consequences and will be treated as a hero. That make us pretty unsatisfied but love also the relationship between the policemans and how they will discover truth after their investigations.

134,14 December 2005,sol-,8, My brief review of the film,"Overall, there is no doubt that this is a good film, and the final half hour is very thrilling, with an excellent conclusion. It unfortunately takes quite a while to reach this point, and in the meantime the film fails to do anything particularly special. On the positive side, it is intriguing, with a complex web of events, the editing gives the film an appropriately exciting style, and the sound recording, whether it be office noises or gunshots, is always on the mark. A couple of things that the film failed to do for me were setting up a feel for the 1950s (the film looks too modern, and there are few indicators of the time period) and maintaining dramatic tension. James Cromwell looks so goofy in his role, and some parts of the film towards the beginning seemed to indicate comedy, in particular with Danny DeVito's character. Guy Pearce is the best of the cast, though perhaps the only one who pulls off a great performance. Kim Basinger won an Oscar, but perhaps for the film's reputation more than anything else. Other than looking a lot like Veronica Lake, there is little else to her role. The violence in the film does not work either. It is too graphic for it to be any dedication to noir, and it is so over-the-top at times that it is as goofy James Cromwell's character is. Perhaps the big problem though is working at what it is trying to say as a film. It is a study of the police force: corruption and working one's way to the top, but these ideas are only really fleshed out towards the end. The film's insight into detective work is good nevertheless, and at the least the film is able to end solidly. So yes, it is a good film with a great conclusion, but the path to getting there could have been improved upon perhaps. I have not read the novel, so maybe that is another thing? Some say that it is a rather good adaptation. Either way, the film is worth a go.",

And although it is a good movie without much doubt, I just don't understand the buckets of a admiration that so many people have towards it. Yes it's well made and acted, but it's also flat, overly long, and quite a joyless watch too, while the plot is nothing that hasn't been done many times before with its good cop caught between his corrupt allies and superiors. One thing that this does do well is that it feels like an actual portrayal of the darker side of criminal life back then (although when Guy Pearce uses a handlkerchief to open the door to the night owl cafe with its two billion finger prints smothered all over it, I couldn't help but chuckle) even compared to the original movies of that period this has more guts with its swear laden script and more explicitly sleazy elements that wouldn't have ever passed through the censors back in the 40s-early 50's.

When I read ""L.A. Confidential"" it was my first venture into Mr James Ellroy's seriously weird world where much of the enjoyment is in the idiosyncratic writing style.I never imagined a movie could be made of the book and,of course,it hasn't been.What we have is the title,some of the characters and a severely pared down plot that bears a resemblance to the novel but fails to capture Mr Ellroy's bizarre voyage to the distant shores of obsessive sexuality.""The book is mine....the movie is theirs"",he said when invited to comment on the screen adaptation. So forget the novel then and watch ""L.A. Confidential"" THE cop movie of the 1990s.Set in the early fifties when cops were tough and the third degree was commonplace it depicts an LAPD that had become judge and jury in its own bailiwick.It's a story of loyalty and betrayal involving cops,reporters,lawyers and crooks.It's a film of extreme violence,much of it played out in the unnaturally bright and sunny L.A. hills. Mr Kevin Spacey has been lauded for his rather flashy role as Sgt Jack Vincennes but for me the performance of the movie is Mr Russell Crowe's as Bud White the not very bright but shrewd thuggish detective. He is easy meat for the manipulative Dudley Smith (Mr James Cromwell) but his Achilles Heel is a sympathy for abused women,and at the same time it is his salvation.Of all the actors in the movie only Mr Crowe looks as if he belongs in his character's clothes.Bud's sports jacket and casual trousers look suits Mr Crowe as to the manner born while the rest of the cast appear too conscious of the fact that they are wearing ""1950s clothes"" rather than simply clothes. There is a lot of good period detail including an appearance by Gerry Mulligan and Chet Baker(the coolest of the cool) lookalikes. Everyone involved is eventually confronted with a dilemma concerning loyalty.How these interlock and how they are resolved is the key to this movie.In the end it all comes down to one question.Is betrayal ever an acceptable option?""L.A.

Guy Pearce and Kim Basinger did fine, as well as Danny Devito. In the end it was slightly overrated but I'd watch it again!",
153,30 March 2008,hnt_dnl,10, Labyrinthine tale that showcased stars-in-the-making,"1997 was a year of great movies that introduced some major Hollywood newcomers and talent. There was Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet (TITANIC), Mark Wahlberg and Julianne Moore (BOOGIE NIGHTS), Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (GOOD WILL HUNTING), and then there's L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, which may perhaps have boasted the best, up and coming talent of all b/c its stars Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce, collectively went on to do much bigger things, although the stars in those other films didn't do too badly either. Spacey had just won Supporting Oscar for THE USUAL SUSPECTS, but he would go on to win the big one (Best Actor for American BEAUTY). Crowe went on to get 3 consecutive Best Actor noms for THE INSIDER, GLADIATOR (won), and A BEAUTIFUL MIND. Pearce went on to star in the highly acclaimed film MEMENTO. Of course the biggest instant winner from L.A. CONFIDENTIAL itself was Kim Basinger, who won Supporting Actress Oscar for her work in this film.",
154,25 April 2008,Aomalle27,10, Perhaps the definitive film of the nineties,"Another nice nostalgia, police procedural flick of the nineties. This one stars (at the time) little known Aussie actors Guy Pearce and Russel Crowe, alongside accomplished character actors Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger and Danny Devito. It's a crime drama in the mold of Kiss of Death, I wake up screaming, or the Big Sleep. Some gritty underworld figures are slowly being eliminated, their are new cops on the beat in Los Angeles, the Department seeks a new reputation as a friendlier organization, but the seedier sides of the city are tearing away at that fragile facade. Some of L.A.'s finest are ca-noodling with high priced hookers cut to look like the famous starlets of the day (Veronica Lake to name but one), others are in bed (figuratively with the local gossip rag), but despite all the flaws of the three main police officers involved in the main course of the movie, they all share a desire to break free of their less than savory ways and become honestly decent cops. The mystery of the film revolves around a shooting at a Hollywood diner, that once delved into, becomes a complex maze of who's who in the criminal world. The difference between right and wrong, good and bad is severely tested, and more than a few won't survive. If you've never viewed a forties style gangster flick, or police procedural, check out this film for a taste of what they were like.",

There were plot and character subtleties that were much easier to appreciate, without having to concentrate as much on what was going on (following the film noir guideline of having a complicated story line).  This movie successfully avoided stereotypical characters; each character had many motivations, some sympathetic, some not. Loved Kevin Spacey's performance (not unusual), and Guy Pearce was really good as Exley.  The thing that most surprised me, however, was finding that James Cromwell who so wonderfully played the heavy, Dudley Smith, is the same James Cromwell that played the wonderful farmer Hoggett in ""Babe"".

170,8 December 2008,film-critic,2, Will this review put me on the QT? How about Hush-Hush?,"In 1997, five films were up for the category of best picture  of those ""LA Confidential"" was a contender. It was an up and down year for the Academy, having the highest grossing picture on the ticket doesn't really allow room for small independent features to see the light of day. Thankfully, ""Good Will Hunting"" proved that wrong, and allowed the comedian Robin Williams to receive the credit he deserved. None the less, ""LA Confidential"" was in the gambit that year, boasting hot new talent, an awe-inspiring image of the golden years of Hollywood, and the grittiness that only James Ellroy could imagine. So, with so many high marks  why didn't this film win? To be honest, my friends, this isn't a very good movie. As other reviews have claimed, and I agree, it is a popcorn film. It has gloss, it has catchy music, and it has veneer, but it lacks the soul to be an award winner. ""LA Confidential"" is a motion picture. In the gambit of releases, it requires one viewing to see where both Russell Crowe and Guy Pierce first found their Hollywood USA footing, but outside of that  it only demonstrates one thing  Kim Basinger didn't need to put her best foot forward to win an award.",

The photography (though not in black and white) was good, direction and pacing smooth and acting was top-notch. So why didn't I like the movie more? First, I found it hard to like anyone. You don't want to like the bad guys, but having the hero have sex with prostitute Bassinger seemed really out of character for a ""good guy"" (as well as yucky considering how many other men had plunged into her nether-regions before him). Secondly, film noir WAS violent and, at times, unforgiving but it wasn't this graphic. Yes, this is probably because LA Confidential was made in 1997 but showing so much isn't so much a homage to the genre but ignoring the rules of film noir--where the viewer knew blood and sex was there but it wasn't explicit.",

177,21 February 2016,frank-liesenborgs,10, Masterpiece is an understatement,"L.A. Confidential is three movies in one. Every time you watch it, you enjoy it more and more. And the third time you can only give it the maximum 10/10 quote on IMDb. The acting is phenomenal. Don't forget that Russell Crowe was not nominated for an Oscar but in 2001 got one for ""Gladiator"", Best Actor in a Leading Role and nominated for 2 more (""The insider"" and ""A beautiful mind""). One year earlier Kevin Spacey won his Oscar (Best Actor in a Supporting Role) in ""The Usual Suspects"", another favorite movie of mine and also Top Rated. In this movie he was also not nominated. But in 2000 took the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role in ""American Beauty"". And the same applies to Guy Pearce who also outperformed in L.A. Confidential and also not nominated. But with ""Memento"", another Top Rated movie (again one of my all-time favorite movies) got 2 Oscars (or at least the Nolan Brothers). So we have a top cast with actors who already made it, or who made it a bit later and shined so bright here that you'd have to have wear sunglasses to watch the movie. Another example, Simon Baker, who plays Matt Reynolds. The scene where Vincennes meets with Sid Hudgens to arrange a sexual encounter with Matt Reynolds takes only 2 minutes. But you can see that Simon Baker has all it takes to become a great actor (and featured in ""The mentalist"" later – not to compare with this movie, but strictly seen from an acting point of view). These are just four great actors but it's the whole cast. To my humble opinion all of them outperformed, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, Paul Guilfoyle and so on. Combine this with a plot that's unbeatable, perfect directing (Curtis Hanson – ""Bad Influence"", ""Too big to fail"" etc) and you have an explosive combination that can only lead to a true masterpiece.",

All the actors in LA Confidential are excellent and the three leading men all went on to star in their own great films after this. Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce.

Special mention to Kin Basinger who puts in a Oscar winning performance as Lyn Brackett. Supporting roles for the always great Danny Devito, and James Cromwell.

183,26 January 2001,jhaggardjr,10, One of the best films of the '90s,"""L.A. Confidential"" is a great movie. This complex mystery-thriller set in 1950s Los Angeles has great acting, great directing, great writing, great just about everything. Here is one of those rare films that pulls you into the story and never lets go. I love it when a movie does that. The main storyline of ""L.A. Confidential"" is about a gruesome mass murder in a nearby diner that has connections with the corrupt L.A. police department. One of the men killed in the slaughter was an L.A. cop. The movie follows two different detectives who try to find who committed the crime and who is connected to it. Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce portray the two detectives, both very different from each other. Crowe is Bud White, the really serious tough cop who doesn't mess around; Pearce is Ed Exley, the self-righteous cop who thinks he can rise above the sleaze in the department. Kevin Spacey also stars as another detective who works with a publisher of a sleazy tabloid played by Danny DeVito. James Cromwell is on hand as the detectives' police captain, and Kim Basinger gives an Oscar-winning performance as Lynn Bracken, the Veronica Lake look-alike call girl who becomes attached to the Crowe character. All these actors are superb here. Director Curtis Hanson does an outstanding job with the way he put this movie together. I was able to follow where this movie was going, and the Oscar-winning adapted screenplay (by Hanson and Brian Helgeland based on James Ellroy's novel) is compelling and brilliantly detailed. The sets and production design is another plus. The movie really looks like 1950s L.A. The cinematography, editing, and music score (by the great Jerry Goldsmith) are all first-rate (not to mention some good old classic songs). I loved everything about ""L.A. Confidential"".

This is a triumph of taste, intelligence, craftsmanship, writing, direction, music, acting, design, in short, pretty much everything. There is not one bad thing I can say about this film.  Curtis Hanson and co-writer Brian Helgeland deserve a lot of credit for taking a complex novel and making it work on the screen, even though they had to cut a lot of good stuff out.  Hanson also pushes himself in the big leagues with his directing, because he really feels close to the material, whereas in his previous films, you just got the sense of a competent craftsman.  The acting is also sensational, and though I wasn't rooting for her to get the Oscar (I would have voted for Julianne Moore with BOOGIE NIGHTS), Kim Basinger gave an excellent performance, no matter what the negative comments here have said.  The standout, however, is Russell Crowe, who not only is frightening when Bud White blows up, but shows vulnerability without going maudlin.

192,9 December 2020,jayjaycee,9, Glamorous neo-noir with phenomenal characters and an outstandingly eclectic screenplay,"""L.A. Confidential"" is a 1997 crime drama directed by Curtis Hanson starring Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce.
⚪
All in all, Curtis Hanson's adaptation of the classic James Ellroy novel is a masterfully constructed police story that successfully resurrects the well-known elements of the fifties' film noir and displays them in all their glamour, and thanks to a intelligently twisted and anything but generic screenplay, superbly performing actors and an indescribably authentic and atmospheric design, it becomes a wonderfully intriguing and stylish homage to the classic crime films that, at the same time, manages to becomes something of its own, nevertheless.
⚪
This time I revisited yet another one of those titles that defined my winter season three years ago, and as if it were just yesterday, I remember what a brilliant experience it was to witness Curtis Hanson's ingenious work. It is one of those films that are almost flawless and feel like they are extremely short, despite having a runtime of almost two and a half hours. How am I not supposed to be extremely consumed by this feature? I mean, just look at the screenplay! What you see in this film is film noir in its finest and most beloved form, and still there is more to it than the nostalgia factor. The way it depicts the investigations is utterly brilliant, because even if it seems like it is incoherent in the beginning, a single effective reveal all suddenly connects everything that previously appeared to be disjointed. However, before I talk about the final, I want to praise the excellently conceptualised main characters and the actors portraying them. Basically, all of them are capable police officers that are good at their jobs, but its their respective understanding of justice and their strategies that define how all the events take place. Crowe plays Bud White, a hot-heated and unconventionally aggressive brute with a passionate hatred for wife-batterers but with his heart in the right place, Pearce portrays Edmund Exley, a hardworking and extremely moral overachiever who would stop at nothing to get to the top and hence is heavily disliked by his colleagues, and at last we have the disgraced Kevin Spacey (I object his person in real life, this is only about his work as an actor) as the sleazy Jack Vincennes who, next to his job as a policeman, collaborates with the local tabloid press by staging scandals and also functions as an advisory in a TV show. Together, the three try to uncover a mystery, and as you can guess, clash with each other thanks to their distinct natures. A pivotal element of this case is the seductive Lynn Bracken, a high-class prostitute and femme fatal, that looks like Hollywood actress Veronica Lake. As wonderful as she looks and as decently as Kim Basinger portrays her, I think it was anything but an Oscar worthy performance she delivered here. Yes, she looks like the actress and yes, she delivers decent acting, but considering that Minnie Driver, Julianne Moore and Gloria Stuart were nominated for ""Good Will Hunting"", ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Titanic"", respectively, it was nothing but a shame, in my opinion, since all the other nominees in fact displayed memorable and outstanding acting. Well, aside from her, the three leading men at least deliver great performances as well. The future ""Gladiator"" star Crowe conveys the ambiguity of his versatile character magnificently, and also Pearce, who would go on to play the protagonist in Christopher Nolan's masterpiece ""Memento"", as well as Spacey deliver powerful performances in their respective roles. I never really understood why the latter received top billing despite being a more important side-character, but fact is, the disharmony between the three totally different characters is what defines this fine film. Through their eyes, we get an insight into the glamorously shady world of Hollywood in the fifties that is defined by depravity and corruption. It is authentic and atmospheric as hell, and it nothing short of intriguing to follow the characters break a case that is more than originally assumed. As mentioned above, for most of the time it seems like that they only do regular police work with no real highlights, cause honestly, there are none and it is almost too simple to be exciting, but it is the unexpected ending that changes it all retrospectively. All the murders, robberies and rape cases that seemed to have been closed, end up being all connected, and even if it is at times a little too confusing (well, at least in my opinion), it makes a lot of sense and is as shocking as it is brilliant. As it turns out, Captain Dudley Smith staged most of the incidents and cleverly twisted the facts for his benefit and wanted to overtake the drug market of the city himself. However, his colleagues get behind his dark deeds, but even though they had the chance to back off and live a easy life, they didn't, so what made them re-open and pursue the case, nevertheless? One word: justice. Even though they define the word entirely differently and had dissimilar incentives, White, Exley and Vincennes wanted to get justice, and I think this is just brilliant. The three detectives who you thought would never work together, overcome intrigues and all the games that have been played with them, and team up for a greater cause. However, as glorious as it sounds, the ending is not all as just as it was planned, cause even if the protagonists have known about Smith's evil side, the press as well as the executive floor don't want to stain the precinct's status, for it would be the ending of it. Eventually, he is still remembered as a hero, but Exley as well. White is left out, but for a good reason, Vincennes has, by the way, been killed earlier on. Achieving justice has its price, and even if Hollywood always conveys this picture, it isn't always gold and glory, and this is what the film excellently manages to depict. In the end, this neo noir is a fine piece of crime story that pays tribute to the era is set in, but also manages to be something of its own. Stylish, elegant, atmospheric and twisted as hell, it deservedly is considered to be one of the greatest films of its sub-genre, and I just love everything about it.",

194,23 May 2018,MJB784,8, Not as great as it used to be,"L. A. Confidential opens with a pitch-perfect voice over narration by Danny DeVito, continues by showcasing the colorful, golden streets of L. A. in the mid 50's with terrific attention to detail in buildings, cars, hairstyle, costumes, interiors, etc., then continues with a terrific story that involves three policemen with very different backgrounds that are all involved in the same case. The case is the Night Owl Cafe murders where a giant bloodbath seems to have happened inside the cafe. One is in it because his partner was one of the dead bodies, another because he took the call and was first on the scene after the murders happened, the last because a blonde bombshell who has information is part of the other officer's case with this sleazy hitman who turns women into prostitutes. In addition, there's a love triangle between the blonde, the hard hitting cop who's partner was murdered and the young rookie cop who took the call. These parts drag to me. The scenes with Crowe and Basinger don't have much interest. I also don't know why the ending credits have black and white footage of a crime show called Badge of Honor which is discussed in the movie, but doesn't need added scenes during the credits.",
195,8 December 2000,Brian-272,8," Corruption, betrayal, and scandal. But a fight for purity and Kim Basinger giving the best performance of her career support claim to the best film of 1997 and perhaps the 90's decade.","Based on a James Ellroy novel in Los Angeles during the 1950's L.A. Confidential delivers a knockout. Though the first time you watch L.A. Confidential you feel the intensity and high drama to find surprise after surprise in the complex and hidden plot. Then after many viewings and you already know how the story unfolds you still enjoy the great acting and admire James Ellroy for having such a fine script. So well written and directed you find yourself glued from start to finish you can't take your eyes off of it. Corruption runs amok in the L.A. police department only to be exposed by a eager young cop Ed Exley (Guy Pearce). Bud White (Russell Crowe) breaks away from the corruption to help Exley after he learns the third cop in the trio and sidekick Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is killed by the corrupt force. I must say Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors in Hollywood today I love watching any movie he plays in. The best supporting element of this entire film is Kim Basinger as Hollywood glamour call girl (Lynn Bracken). She did indeed deserve her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Kim gave a performance that just brightens up the film her beauty is touching. That's the best Kim has ever looked everything from her bold blond hair and body you just name it. L.A. Confidential gives a message to me that we should all search and try to experience some purity from time to time. With corruption as found in this film and many other places hope for more honesty and truth can be experienced more. I like the way Pearce, Basinger, and Crowe beat corruption. Now that's some purity. L.A. Confidential is a great movie due to the script, cast, and message it presents, the best of 1997.",
196,15 March 2003,Silverzero,10," Off the record, on the QT, and very. Hush hush.","That sums up the epitome of L.A. Confidential. It presents to us the sordid realism of the early 50's, in the way we haven't seen it. Most of us are used to the sugary `Gene Kelly/ Rock Hudson' sunshine utopia that was, in the MGM `Golden Age'. L.A. Confidential shows us the gritty, seedy underworld of this period. And a brilliant job it does aswell. This deft, elegant portrait succeeds on every level. ",

202,9 March 2005,Cpartak,10, Brilliant,"I usually refrain from reviewing films on IMDb unless I feel very passionately about them and believe that I need to voice my opinion. This can apply to both films that I loved or despised. Either way, I see no point in reviewing a mediocre film that I forget about the second I step out of the theatre. With that having been said, L.A. Confidential is nothing short of perfection. As with any great film everything starts with the screenplay which in this case was written by Brian Helgeland and Curtis Henson, the latter of which was also the director. The script was adapted from a novel by James Ellroy that I'm ashamed to say I haven't read. However, I have heard that many believed it to be an impossible task to adapt the novel into a film. That makes the screenplay of Helgeland and Henson all the more impressive. An equally daunting task for a great film is to assemble a top notch cast. Once again, L.A. Confidential hits the mark with one of the most impressive casts in recent film history. Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Kim Basinger (who received an Oscar for her role), Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, and Danny DeVito comprise the absolutely top class cast of the film. Yet in my opinion, all of the aforementioned aspects of the film are not even the best part. The best part has to be the absolutely tremendous set designs, costumes, and general recreation of 1950's Hollywood culture. I feel that this was an amazing time and place in American history, and this film takes the audience there. One of the best scenes in L.A. Confidential involves two of the main characters running into a Hollywood starlet who they believe is a fake. What I love about this scene is how subtly the director reminds us that this isn't just any place in America, this is 1950's Hollywood where huge stars like Lana Turner can be found socializing with a member of the mob at a local hot spot. That is the beauty of this film. You feel like you're watching a 1950's film noir through a 1990's camera lens. ",
203,7 October 2002,lemasque,5, Only half GREAT!,"Reviewers have been far too generous in praise of La Confidential. The script is a perfect example of Hollywood once again dropping the ball. The first half of the film is GREAT, as good or better than I wanted it to be: a juicy plot (plus various sub plots) of just the right complexity, a seductively delicious milieu, and fascinating characters.",

205,14 August 2008,Rockford_6,9, On of the best movies,"When you look back at it and see that Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey and Guy Pearce actually appeared in the same film back in 97 then you wouldn't have believed it since they have all gone on to better things but before that we had L.A. Confidential which was Crowe's and Pearce's ticket into Hollywood. Spacey had already made it with his Best Supporting Actor nod for The Usual Suspects but what puzzles me is how everybody apart from Kim Basinger didn't get any acting nominations at the Oscars. James Cromwell is the most chilled out villain you'll ever going to see in a film like this and has been criminally ignored by the Academy. Curtis Hanson was also someone who had made some good films but no masterpieces till this came along. They all must have sold their souls to make this because when you get big cast get together to make a Hollywood film then you become a bit intrigued by it because if the cast is big then is the story any good? In L.A. Confidential's case it had both and a lot more to say the least.",

This film is awesome, and Russell Crowe is a revelation.  This film explains how an actor relatively unknown in America at the time, got the leading part in such an important and expensive film as Gladiator.  This man is the most impressive actor in motion pictures at the moment and it can only be a matter of time before he is rightly awarded by the Academy. The film itself is as good if not better than any of the best crime films ever made.   I'll leave it at that and will watch out for director Curtis Hanson again who is new to me.",

CONFIDENTIAL is unquestionably the perfect postwar bookend. In the years since the Jack Nicholson classic Hollywood has attempted many times to replicate the seductive nature of classic film noir, only to collapse under the weight of its own timidity. The great thing about L. A. CONFIDENTIAL is that it refuses to be dictated to by the whims of politically correct behavior, preferring instead to expose all of the warts that fester underneath the glamour.",

211,15 September 2013,mediapeertime,9, Awesome Character Piece,"A movie that pretty much launched Russel Crowe and Guy Pearce, L.A. Confidential provides some of the best in character development in films post 1990. A group of Los Angeles police officers in the late 1940s find themselves unraveling and involved with a brutal mass murder. Is it the mob, led by famous LA gangster Mickey Cohen? African American hoodlums, who the police initially target? Or the cops themselves. Every cop character in this movie has a different personality, and a different motive for why he is good, bad, or both. Crowe's performance was nothing short of outstanding, as was Pearce. These were two guys who hated each other and couldn't be more opposite, but both out for doing right. Pearce's character often annoying and nerdish. Crowe, a very likable tough guy. James Cromwell, the smart, straight, but really shady captain, outstanding. Grahem Beckel as Crowe's dirty cop partner, outstanding. Kevin Spacey, a cop torn between his love for being the consultant for a Hollywood TV cop show and making a buck selling stories and following the law in important cases, outstanding. David Stratherin and Danny DeVito, outstanding. The only question. Why did Kim Bassinger win an Academy Award for this movie? There was nothing really outstanding in her performance, and the role wasn't all that important to the film. The writing, outstanding, better than outstanding, as was the direction. There were so many better performances in this film that warranted the award.",
212,3 April 2007,newday98074,6, What?,"I admit to being amazed at the rating for this movie, higher than many better scripted and shot films whose time, I guess, has passed. Younger viewers like the lure of sex and violence in a glittering wrapper regardless of the quality of same. Sin City is the next derivation, and the next? I doubt it will say much about the human condition and how to live better, but then Hollywood has lost the Capras and Wilders who cared. LA confidential is a less than smart story of betrayal, stupidity, corruption, greed, sex and hopelessness. What is lacking is any sense of humanity and why we should want any of these people to live or die. Who are they and what do they tell us about life? Where is beauty, tragedy, sensuality, a sense of the thrilling and ephemeral? Who cares about a comic book?",
213,2 February 2004,Manthorpe,10, An instant classic.,"L.A. Confidential has one of the best screenplay's ever written, which is complimented by excellent castingwhich produced some top-notch performances from some virtual unknowns at the time. Guy Pearce, Russel Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and James Cromwell were all perfectly cast for this film. Kim Basinger won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role, although some of her fellow cast members were more deserving of an award. Had the Hype-tanic not been released the same year, this film would have completely swept the Oscars. Damn undeserving Titanic. Oh well. That just goes to show that the Academy doesn't necessarily reflect respect where it's deserved. Even though this film scored a few, the Titanic swept the 1997 awards, including Best Picture.

215,22 January 2003,susansweb,6, I just can't get over the ending -- too pat.,"One of the strengths of this movie was that it was an old-fashioned film noir made without any of the constraints that the old studio system would have required.  The old studios rules were that: good always will prevail (check), there must be a romance (check, in a movie as cynical as this one the Kim Basinger - Russell Crowe romance really seems out of place) and possible redemption (check, Kevin Spacey).  This wouldn't have bothered me except the first part of the movie was so good and was moving towards a modern (complicated and unresolved) finish when it was like the studio swooped in and said ""No, we better make sure there is a happy ending so we won't offend anyone.""  Oh sure, there is plenty of profanity and a big emphasis on sex, drug use and racism to give ""L.A. Confidential"" the modern edge but where's that ""Forget it, it's Chinatown, Jake"" finish?",

217,21 June 2012,Cosmoeticadotcom,9, Great,"L.A. Confidential is a great film not because it is revolutionary, in terms of style nor approach, but because it is so uniformly excellent in every area. It is one of those films that stands in counterpoint to the director as auteur, although surely a different director would have made a different film. The point is that the material is so good that it's one of those can't miss films. It also exemplifies that the most revolutionary thing in art is greatness, especially sustained greatness. Any work of art, and any artist, has to be judged in this manner, since it is the only objective way to evaluate things. Notions like revolutionary or daring are too subjective. What was revolutionary often becomes clichéd. True originality resists easy mimicry and subsequent triteness.",
218,14 October 2013,David_Brown,10, Should have won the Oscar,"There is one thing that most people who have seen LA Confidential can agree on it should have beaten out Titanic as Best Picture of the year. The performances are flawless, obviously Kim Basinger as Lynn Bracken was the Standout ( winning the Oscar), but so was everyone else. The unusual Thing is there is really is only one good guy in the movie which was ""Bud"" White ( Russell Crowe), who although a violent person was decent and heroic. I go back to to what Lynn said to Lieutentent Exley ( Guy Pearce). "" you're afraid of Bud because you can't figure out how to play him. He doesn't follow the same rules of politics as you do . It makes him dangerous. I see Bud because I want to. I see But because he can't hide the good inside of him. I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who f---s for money. I see Bud because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is. I see Bud for all the ways he is different from you."" Spoilers Ahead: Another difference, is he takes bullets for Exley, when the corrupt Captain Dudley Smith ( James Cromwell), tried to kill him. Another difference is Exley shot Smith in the back ( instead of arresting him or at least looking him in the eye, which of course, is cowardly). Smith, is really the worst one of all who wanted to take over the drug trade, and murdered fellow Police Officer Jack Vincennes ( Kevin Spacey), in his own home. Other miserable characters are the deep in the closet, DA, blackmailer Sid Hudgens ( Danny DeVito), and every other character except Bud and Lynn. The ending apparently said it all where the Crooked Smith and the murderous Exley are made out to look like heroes and as Lynn put perfectly "" some men get the world ( Exley), and others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona ( White).""However, I am not so sure that Exley won, because "" And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your soul?"" ( Mark: 8:36). I think White was the winner because he was at least able to get to Arizona with Lynn. Is she perfect? No but she does love him, and he was able to not only survive ( unlike Smith and others), but can at least look at himself in the mirror ( unlike Exley). Basically this film is a masterpiece that should have won the Oscar. 10/10 Stars",
219,23 February 2001,thehumanduvet,10, A true modern classic,"This great throwback to cop/gangster flicks of the golden age is a wonderfully realised treat for fans of the genre and all movie lovers, featuring a gang of top stars on blistering form, working from a brilliant script under very classy direction. Shades of noir classic Touch of Evil hang over this cracking thriller (check out the oil pumps pounding away in the background in the finales of both films), dealing with moral and political shenanigans in the LAPD and the movie-star-and-drug-baron milieu of Marlowe and Sam Spade. Spacey, Crowe and Guy Pearce head a brilliant cast that includes great turns from Danny DeVito, Kim Basinger and James Cromwell, all caught up in a fantastically complex web of corruption and crime that unravels itself beautifully as the film builds to its pounding climax. At heart though this is a moral picture looking at the pursuit of justice in an ethically complex world, and a buddy picture about tough men overcoming their differences to pull together towards a common goal of good over evil. A great soundtrack of period tunes and a few deft touches of humour put the finishing touches on a film that comes pretty near perfection.",

It's a shame that this movie got screwed out of Best Picture in '97, and in its stead it won an award for a non-stand out performance from Kim Basinger. While I say it's a non-stand out to me, that's not to say it was bad because it was good, but when you're competing against the likes of Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and James Cromwell, it's hard to give her that kind of recognition.",

Yes it's well made and acted, but it's also flat, overly long, and quite a joyless watch too, while the plot is nothing that hasn't been done many times before with its good cop caught between his corrupt allies and superiors. One thing that this does do well is that it feels like an actual portrayal of the darker side of criminal life back then (although when Guy Pearce uses a handlkerchief to open the door to the night owl cafe with its two billion finger prints smothered all over it, I couldn't help but chuckle) even compared to the original movies of that period this has more guts with its swear laden script and more explicitly sleazy elements that wouldn't have ever passed through the censors back in the 40s-early 50's.

Confidential grabs your attention and doesn't release it until the credits role. This is both an intriguing mystery and a brilliant character study shot in the style of the classic film-noir. Like Chinatown before it, L.A. Confidential gained instant classic status as if it wasn't for the fact that we know it was made in the late nineties; it could easily have been made during the peak of the film-noir era. Through a flawless ensemble cast and brilliant storytelling, this film has cemented itself as a modern classic and what I consider to be the best film of the nineties on the whole.",

It's predictable; during the action scenes it's easy to tell who's going to survive, who's going to get a scratch, and who's going to fall. I have seen it before and it seems like I have to see it again. The script and acting during the first hour is not realistic, but standard Hollywood; so common everybody else finds it natural.

Confidential (1990), and White Jazz (1992) while living in Montana after a sort of cold turkey I experienced when I had devoured all of the Dashiell Hammett's, James M. Cain's, Ross MacDonald's, and Raymond Chandler's I could at that time get my hands on. They were all great reads, but unfortunately, this was before I really began to appreciate Film Noir and get a stylistic visual from those series of films of the world Ellroy was depicting. ",
244,21 December 2004,paul2001sw-1,9, A darker shade of noir,"Three bad cops, each repugnant in their own ways: these are the central characters of James Ellroy's 'L.A. Confidential', a gem of a book for those who like their thrillers ultra-tough and equally byzantine. If Ellroy has a weakness, it's a tendency to excess, both in tone and in plotting. Part of the reason Curtis Hanson's film of the novel is quite so entertaining is that he makes two spot on choices. Firstly, the mood of his movie is two parts hard-boiled realism to one part cartoon, which perfectly matches the book. Secondly, the greatest meanderings of the labyrinthine story are pared down, without sacrificing the complex essence (and essential complexity) of the tale. He also gets a string of great performances from his stars, hamming it up just enough but never too far: Russell Crowe does his usual meat-head with a heart role, Kim Basinger plays a femme fatale but most enjoyable is the double act of Danny de Vito and Kevin Spacey. James Cromwell is also good, although he seems confused as to whether he is Irish or Welsh! The result is utterly gripping and enormous fun, but it's no 'French Connection': ultimately, the film is far kinder on its violent hero Bud White (Crowe) than that other film is on Popeye Doyle, and the good versus bad ending is more conventional than the first two thirds of the film (or indeed, than the book's own, more confused, conclusion). But it's still a show of the highest class.",
245,10 July 2003,ichabod81,10, The perfect film.,"You know how Wes Bentley's character is watching the drifting bag from video with Thora Birch in American Beauty? And he speaks of life and world being sometimes so beautiful, that he feels he can't take it. I get that feeling with watching L.A. Confidential. This is a beautiful movie. It really takes you to the 50's and gives you a warm feeling of film noir. I have to admit never reading the book, but actually that takes me to a better position to rate this film as a film and not a book adaptation. And it works. My god, how it works. The characters are so far from being boring, that you'd be thrilled if they actually could jump from the screen to real life.. hell, even the bad guys. Curtis Hanson finally showed us his real potential as a filmmaker, after the likes of The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and The River Wild. Those films were not bad (actually quite good), but in the end they were just ordinary thrillers. L.A. Confidential explores deeper. The plot is not one-dimensional and I really didn't see the twists coming a mile away. Throughout the film, every character is perfectly cast and they all should have been up for Oscars. Looking for an intelligent film? Look no further.",

This movie is a story about the Los Angeles police corruption. There are three main actors,Bud white, Exley and Jack vincennes, they are all policemen,and don't like each other but involved together because of a homicide. These three actors have their own charactors, white is impulsive,but kind and soft, he hates the bully men because of his miserable childhood. Exley is smart and ambitious,he is trying to find the man who killed his father. The last one is jake, a smart man but selfish.
The most classical scene is when jack vincennes said rollo tomasi to liam,and then liam said it to exley, wow, every time i saw here,i was so surprised by the design. At last jake was shoted and dead,but he give exley a sign to find out the truly killer.
Expect for three main actors,there is a actress,she has just played a small part but bright, because of this movie i know that she was Kim Besinger. In the movie,white and exley all love her ,and in my opinion, i think she loves them two, but finally she choose white because of she likes the peaceful life. When the case is over, she said to exley,Some men get the world. Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.she is so gentle,I'm completely understand why two men fall in love with her completely, and i also love her. And she got an oscar for her best performed in this movie.
Finally ,i think this movie is good enough to watch more times.",

I found myself tolerating the film more than enjoying it, although there are a few scenes which do deliver some memorable images and dialogue. I suppose the biggest disappointment for me was the unnecessary, even offensive Political Correctness which this film uses when referring to groups of people and certain human behavior; bowdlerizing Ellroy's GREAT novel is not the way to do it.

267,5 December 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,9," Very good, but too slow and overly complicated","I decided to check out this film after hearing many good things about it, among others that it was the best film Curtis Hanson has made... and since Hanson also directed 8 Mile, a movie I enjoyed very much and have seen several times, I thought it would be worth watching. I wasn't mistaken. What I wasn't prepared for, however, was how darn slow it was... it never seemed to take off. Maybe it's the fact that there are almost constantly introduced new characters, maybe it's the fact that half of the actions in the film don't seem to have much of an impact on anything, other than move the plot a little bit forward(a tiny little bit)... I don't know. It never really captivated me, and I found myself often not paying that much attention to it. The film is good, no doubt about it... but it's just so slow... and in the end, it seems unrealistic. The very ending seems to be set up to throw in an action scene. The plot is good, but the pacing is bad. The script is good. The acting is great. The characters are well-written and well-acted. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. The film has so much going for it, and, luckily, pulls most of if off perfectly. But that pacing is horrendous. I haven't read the novel which this film is based on, but I think that the film does it justice... anyway, that's what the author says on one of the featurettes on the DVD. The dialog has several memorable lines, the characters are conflicted and not immediately likable, but you eventually grow to like them, the script has some great scenes... but the pacing just... no. Maybe it had something to do with how hard it was for me to tell Kevin Spacey's and Russell Crowe's characters apart, partly because they looked alike and partly because both characters acted alike. I liked this movie, but I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't bored out of my mind for about a fourth of the run-time, scattered around the film. Too long and too big, in my opinion... but not bad. I recommend this to fans of Curtis Hanson, neo-noir drama-mystery-thrillers and any of the actors involved in it. 9/10",

273,21 January 2023,robert3750,9, Superbly written period crime drama,"The film tells a gritty, noirish tale about the seamy underside of Los Angeles, beneath all the glamour and glitz. Warner Brothers was justifiably proud of this movie, which makes excellent use of location shots to give a good feel for the ""city of angels"". It takes place in 1953, before housing prices had skyrocketed, before the network of freeways had been built, before even Disneyland, a time when there were real movie stars, and people came from other parts of the country to pursue their dreams. One means by which those dreams are fulfilled in the movie (and in reality, is my understanding) is by using plastic surgery to make call girls look like movie stars. The focus of the film is on three LA detectives: Bud, a violent, hot tempered man who pays little attention to rules when dealing with criminals and is highly protective of women, Ed, a smart, ambitious up and comer following in the footsteps of his father, and Jack, a technical advisor to a police show who gets paid by ""Hush Hush"" (a sleazy publication based on the real life magazine Confidential) to give them tips on publicizing various vice related scandals.

275,11 November 1998,I DUMB,10, LA Confidential puts Titanic to shame.,"Without a doubt,the best movie of 1997.  Why this did not receive more Oscar consideration is beyond me.  Russell Crowe definitely should have been nominated for Best Actor.  He portrays the sense of having bottled rage that can explode at any minute better than any other actor I have seen on the screen.  Kevin Spacey gave another monumental performance yet received no Oscar nomination.  I guess having back to back to back great performances will do that to you.  You cannot find a better trio to play these three cops.  White(Crowe) is the veteran cop who loves to use violence to get the job done.  Exley(Pearce) is the straight as an arrow rookie who prefers to use his smarts and mind games in place of violence.  He is kniving and has no reservations to stab you in the back to ahead.  These two characters are perfect because they are complete opposites of each other. Vincennes(Spacey) is a medium of the two.  He used to be like White but is what Exley is striving to become.  His transformation throughout the film to amend his wrong actions give his character in this film the most credibility.  The one thing I did not agree with was Kim Basinger's win of Best Supporting Actress.  She seemed quite dull and did not give half the performance as Crowe or Spacey.  Also, if you watch this movie, watch out for the funniest moment on screen this year dealing with Exley insulting the ""Lana Turner hooker.""",

It yeilds an award winning cast, superb plot, great action, and masterful art direction.  By art direction I mean the way that the movie really does seem to take place in 1953.  The costumes and hairstyles, the car models and years, the intense Los Angeles background, etc.  It all comes out to make the movie have a great and unique image.  Many compare the image of LA Confidential to that of The Untouchables.  One major flaw: LA Confidential was a serious picture with great charcaters while Untouchables had those charcaters who had that whole comical image about them, like the bookman at the end, or Capone's cliched groupies who pretty much seemed like they came directly from an old Dick Tracy cartoon clip.  Besides the sincere and successful image, the plot is absolutely superb, nearly perfect.  It combines deep and confusing mystery with a great dramatic story of cops.  Besides the plot, the cast is great too.  Kevin Spacey, one of my favorite actors, functions very well as the fame hungry and funny cop Jack ""Big V"" Vincennes.

The film, which is based on James Ellroy's novel offers two vastly differing views on the meaning of justice, explicated in the varying styles of police work that the characters perform. Each man represents a different and opposing discourse within the police department. There is much ""dialogic"" between each of the discourses. For example, the commander, Dudley says ""the department needs smart men (political men) like Exley and direct men like White"". The differences between these characters will be discussed later on. At first each discourse exists in its own realm, in terms of binary oppositions. But later on, the characters realize that they cannot do their jobs to the utmost of their ability when they are stuck solely in their own methodology of police work, and therefore the story begins to deconstruct the various binary oppositions.",

This film has terrific acting, cinematography, a great screenplay and great character development. The book was phenomenal as well and the film got the stamp of approval from write James Ellroy. Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland wrote a great screenplay from the book. This film could have been a disaster, but their terrific screen writing was a testament to a great book.",

291,18 April 2003,Blade_Le_Flambeur,9, Fantastic Detective Story,"L.A. Confidential surpasses many other detective films like Insomnia for many reasons. First off, the performances for all three leads are incredible as well as the supporting characters. They portray their characters with utter perfection, and they never actually expose themselves, but instead rather lose themselves in their parts and lets the viewers understand them. Kevin Spacey as the celebrity cop, Guy Pearce as the golden boy Policeman and of course Russlle Crowe as a brutal yet sensitive police officer. The supporting acting by James Corwell and Danny Devito are excellent as well, but Kim Basinger was only good in it. In terms of the script, it was amazing, a very accurate depiction of 1950's L.A. Each character has this unique sense to them and it comes out in their lines. In terms of photography, this movie isn't very lush but isn't too gritty either so it's not exactly excellent. Curtis Hanson provides a very thorough direction of all the information on paper, but he lacked a real punch and the movie ended up not being brilliant and breathtaking. As for the oscars, Kim Basinger didn't deserve best supporting actress for her role because she didn't really do that much. Adapted screenplay was very well earned, though I haven't read the novel so I can't really talk about the ""adapted"". However, Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe needed to be nominated for their fine performances, as well as Guy Pearce. This movie deserved Best Picture over Titanic for sure, but doubts around Best Director. A solid look at crime and detective works, but overall it lacks a really fluent narrative. 9.5/10",
292,10 May 2000,cathyyoung1,8," Brilliant, powerful, gripping","A top-notch dark drama of crime and corruption, ""LA Confidential"" is one of the most memorable films of the 1990s, thanks to an intelligent and cliche-free script, good direction, and superb acting.  I'd have to single out Kevin Spacey, who is great in everything (he even redeems ""Outbreak"" from total mediocrity, overshadowing Dustin Hoffman).  Here, he truly shines as Jack Vincennes, an urbane, charming, cynical, somewhat corrupt cop struggling with his conscience.  Almost as outstanding is Danny DeVito as the sleazy tabloid journalist Sid Hudgins.  Kim Basinger gives her subtlest and most nuanced performance ever as Lynn, the call girl made to look like Veronica Lake.  Russell Crowe is excellent as Bud White, the brutish but good-hearted cop, and Guy Pearce gives an utterly convincing and often mesmerizing performance as Edmund Exley, the police officer who starts out as a self-righteous, priggish, ice-cold careerist and then becomes a man of true moral conviction who also has humanity and compassion.  In a lesser but crucial role, James Cromwell is very good as Captain Dudley Smith.",

Anyways, i don't know anything about where the inspiration comes from to the writer of the game but L. A. Confidential definitely helps. It has taken straight from the movie. You know, the era, the clothes, the cars, mystery crime thriller, a detective who gets a promotion all the way up, even the narrative comes from the headlines in each chapter.

The performances by Russell Crowe, Guy Pierce, Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito and David Strathairn are all excellent.  Brian Helgelands's violent script adapted from James Ellroy's amazing novel is brilliant.  And the direction by Curtis Hanson is stylish and brutal.  Academy Awards deserved to be spread around the board for this one, but unfortunately, Helgeland's script and Basinger's performance were the only aspect awarded.  (Two of the only awards Titanic didn't win that year).  This film is unfairly compared to ""Chinatown"", but the only similarities between the two are the atmosphere and genre.  ""Chinatown"" contains more complexities in thought and action while ""LA Confidential"" is dense in plot and character action.  ""LA Confidential"" is a superbly well made motion picture and is a must-see for fans of crime drama.  One of the elite in this genre.",

Well then, forget the movie and read the book! I sat dumbfounded watching this movie trying to figure if the characters on the screen were supposed to be the same ones  adapted from the book. The ONLY character who even remotely the same was Ed Exley played by Russell Crowe, and any similarity between Jack Vinsenze in print and on film is purely coincidental. The only people who think that this movie is any good, are those that haven't read the book. Take my advice boys and girls, read the book, you'll have no desire to watch this film ever again.",

301,6 July 2006,BrohmaBull007,9, The Best of the Good Cop/Bad Cop Theme,"This movie was great. I didn't know what to expect when I rented this but I was pleased with the result. Lets start with acting. Russell Crowe exceeded my expectations and played one of the toughest, roughest cops I've seen. Guy as the nerdy simple cop was annoying at times but towards the end you start to like the guy. Kim Basinger played a surprisingly good performance with her smooth conversational lines and great scene presence. Spacey...although his time was limited did play the role of the wisecrack cop perfectly......spitting out hilarious laid back lines to add comedy to this drama. The character development in this movie is what I liked the most. Every character starts off with a simple label but as they get entwined in the mystery they start changing their attitudes...most of the time it was done so they can get to bottom of the mystery. You'll be surprised as to who is running this crooked cop gang........at least I was. The plot twists were amazing and just when you thought the case was solved they added in reasonable twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. I'll admit the beginning was good.but towards the middle I started to get confused and bored but at the end.....they kick it up a notch and finish it all off with secrets revealed, puzzles put together, and a great gunfight. If you like cop movies then I suggest this one to start. I thought this movie was overrated on the top 250 but I was not disappointed. Overall 9/10",
302,31 May 2002,kreidler,5, I know everyone loves it but...,...I didn't.  I found the movie to be very convoluted and I didn't care enough about any of the characters to stay with it.

I've avoided revisiting it in more recent times mainly because of Spacey. I've been seriously bullied myself by someone with a bit of a public profile; I know how painful and triggering it can be to see these people or their work lauded. It's an issue I remain unable to resolve. I was hoping this wasn't as good as I remember; unfortunately, it is. There were many good reasons I loved it then and that it still speaks. It does seem apt that Spacey plays a key role in a film in which none of the male characters get away clean. All the performances are excellent, and the casting of Guy Pearce was especially inspired. The screenplay is exceptional, the direction and cinematography just right ... pretty much everything just works. The themes of compromise and corruption remain sadly pertinent, and it still grips mercilessly. Spacey remains a big problem; unfortunately in that regard, the film remains a masterwork.",
306,18 May 2016,Horror-yo,8, Excellent 90's crime,"This is a subtly crafted, multi-layered action-crime movie that excels on a number of levels, and does just about everything in that textbook 'just right' way. It's a story of jealousy, power, men in competition and friendship, with a feel for the mysterious, and an interesting angle on ""the right thing to do"". Superb cast of actors. Tension very well built. The story is complex but not over-complicated, and never goes overboard with excess. It's just right, and makes for a very smooth viewing. There's just enough dialog, well written and believable, and then it also delivers the goods in terms of hard-hitting action, but while always keeping the plot in check. Top notch crime from the 90's, possibly a golden age for the genre, and if you're ever going to watch one, start with this one. You can't go wrong. All the ingredients are there.",

The exciting plot leaves you on the edge of your seat and the characters are well-written and well-acted. The only problem is that I don't think the heroes would turn up to the shootout at the end if they smelt a set-up and they'd drive away rather than make he tactical mistake of letting themselves got holed up in a house surrounded by people trying to kill them (although it does provide good cover for them).",

316,1 February 2007,silbersam,10, Perfect,"The best American film of the 1990s, the movie that made me believe in Hollywood again. The movie that jump-started Kiam Basinger's second chance and the movie that proved the star power of Russell Crowe. The characters played by both of them are profoundly human, flawed yet endearing, and they deliver lines that blow you away, as good as anything Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall delivered in ""The Big Sleep"". The twists and turns of the plot keep you nailed to your seat and there are scenes so suddenly surprising that the first time you see them you don't believe your eyes. Kevin Spacey shines as a cop who thinks he's cool and who can be bought for a penny, while Danny de Vito reminds us that he can be a great actor as a quick-buck pathetic journalist who makes a profit of exposing human weakness to gossip and scandal oblivious of the lives he ruins day after day. David Strathairn makes a mark with an almost invisible role, James Cromwell gives an Academuy-award giving performance and Guy Pierce breaks through as a glassy-eyed careerist who wins acclaim and loses his soul as he pushes his way up the ranks of the L.A. police force. The only way to succeed in the city of fallen angels is corruption, to follow the devil's advice and to ""lose the glasses, boyo."" To climb up in this town you need to freefall down. There's no success like failure -I'm quoting Dylan-- and failure's no success at all.",

The media appears to be everywhere you look in L.A. Confidential. Had this film been made at the time of The Maltese Falcon (1942), the media wouldn't have been as omniprescent.  It is interesting to note the similarities between the two films, as both are examples of the classical Hollywood narration.

On the other hand, Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe were robbed of nominations, both (especially Pearce) give terrific performances.

Russel Crowe seemed to play a typical role, but very well.  Kevin Spacey is always excellent.  I'm sure Kim Basinger's acting was marvelous as well but I was so distracted by how gorgeous she was I could hardly pay attention.  The plot ranks up there, probably above The Usual Suspects.  I think the twist at the end of Usual Suspects was better, but everything in LA Confidential is brilliant.  The characters are all so well developed. My only complaint is that Guy Pearce's character seemed too easily accepted after his ratting out other officers.  Not downplay Guy Pearce's performance which was also quite good.

In other words although L.A. Confidential IS violent at times the violent is only a percentage of the film as opposed to the be all and end all with Scorcese and Tarentino. Here the violence punctuates a highly stylish thriller in which several strands are artfully woven into a fine tapestry with a subtlety and sophistication totally alien to and beyond the capabilities of Scorcese and Tarentino.

370,9 March 2009,jkebttn71,10," cool, concise and brilliantly crafted","This is one of my favourite films of all time; the best detective movie ever! Russel crowe, Kevin spacey and James Cromwell play the coolest cops ever and Guy Pearce does an equally fantastic job as the uptight 'to the book' cop. The film starts off by showing each of the cops specific techniques of dealing with problems; Bud white (Crowe) has a major dislike for women abusers and believes they should be punished severely. Ed Exley (Pearce)is an uptight man who wears glasses, very unpopular amongst the police. As the film is set in the 1950's at the time of rising film/ t.v. stars there is the 'commericial' cop; Jack vincennes (Spacey) perhaps the best character. And the Legendary James Cromwell as Lt.Dudley Smith the boss, I won't say more. After a mass shooting in a diner (the nite owl) possible leads shoot off in every direction as the 3 detectives search for the rest of the pieces to the puzzle. As the story builds a look a like call girl (Kim Basinger) falls into the plot and so too does talkative press man and friend of Jack vincennes (Danny Devito, who also narrates). The screenplay has both clever plot twists and; flash dialogue, characters and setting. The plot twists and characterisation is on par with the usual suspects but with one difference; L.A. confidential is always; 'Off the record, on the QT and very Hush Hush'",
371,1 September 2003,Davidmon5,10, Masterpiece,"This incredible piece of work is my favorite film of all time, but no matter who you ask it ranks up there with the greatest. Hanson did a spectacular job adapting James Ellroy's novel, a complex detective yarn that is character (as opposed to plot) driven.  Presenting characters with such depth is truly an amazing feat...most screenwriters and directors would have botched any attempt to put this story on the big screen. Kim Basinger received an Oscar for her portrayal of Lynn, and while she delivers a solid performance, it's probably the least impressive in the film.  Everyone does a fantastic job, but Basinger was the only superstar at the time of release and was rewarded for choosing to participate in such an intelligent project.  The movie really launched the careers of Pierce and Crowe, and while Spacey's career had already been established, it was this role that cemented his place as one of the best contemporary American actors. Every single aspect of this noir film fits together perfectly, from the wonderful performances, the beautiful cinematography, the magnificent, amazingly complimentary soundtrack, the intriguing web-like storyline, and the expert timing and directing.  The movie explodes out of its genre, replacing the expected smoky, dingy backrooms with vivid colors.  The film brings an era to life that is normally dulled in our collective memory like an aging black-and-white photograph with an impressive effort made for authenticity.  The contrast between the deep dark depths of the human soul and the broad daylight imagery is pure brilliance. There is not a single traditional ""good guy"" in the entire movie, and yet it won't leave the observer apathetic about the outcome.  L.A. Confidential manages to evoke a range of emotions, exploring in depth the complex, dual human nature of many of its characters. This is a movie you can see over and over and get something new out of it every time.  If you've only seen parts of this movie, or don't remember it, go sit down with a bag of popcorn in a dark room and watch the whole thing start to finish.  And pay attention.  It will be well worth it.",

James Cromwell put in a good performance. Russell Crowe was brilliant. However, my two favourite performances came from Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey, who once again have displayed how they got where they are.

379,4 December 1998,sexyrebl,10, What a Classic!!,"Curtis Hanson directed the 1997 nostalgic film ""L.A. Confidential"" and boy did he ever hit nail on the head with classic. This was probably one of the best acted films of 1997 (The Ice Storm and The Wings of the Dove were the others!!).  This film kept you in suspense throughout the whole movie.  It was too bad that this nostalgic masterpiece didn't get more recognition by the Academy for this piece of art. The acting was superb!  Guy Pearce should've been nominated for Best Actor for his role of a by-the-book cop who tries to crack a very complex case this role was a very big stretch for this Austrailian Actor.  Kevin Spacey once again shows us his talents with another spot-on performance and is probably the best character-actors of the 90's and was spotless in this movie!!  James Cromwell was every bit as good as he was in ""Babe"" by playing the villainous cop in this movie and was outstanding here in L.A Confiential.  Russel Crowe did an excellent job playing the role as a hot-tempered cop and should've been nominated for Best Supporting Actor for this movie!!  Of course, no L.A. Confidential critique would be fulfilled without talking about Kim Basinger's stylish and outstanding performace by playing the Lana Turner-like hooker Lyn Braken.  Kim Basinger deserved to win for her performace and after years of heartbreak for this talented actress she finally gets her crowning glory and it was a well-deserved win for her. I believe that this movie deserved the Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress and probably should've won more.  I believe that this movie was a work of art and Curtis Hanson got some well-deserved recognition for his wonderful work.  I would definitely recommend you rent this movie as soon as possible!!",
380,17 April 1999,karma185,9, Awesome,"I saw this movie on HBO because I thought nothing else was on. I was reluctant to see it because I usually don't watch cop movies. (I'm under 18, what can I say.  They don't market them for my age group) I couldn't have been more wrong. L.A. Confidential was awesome, very high on my list of good movies, because it was so well done.  The Los Angeles aspect was so distinct, which I appreciated even though I don't know anything about the 50s that isn't on Nick at Nite.  The acting was awesome too, enough that it should have been more recognized at the Oscars.  Everyone gives kudos to Spacey and he was great but I didn't consider him the main part of the film.  I thought that the acting of Guy Pearce and especially of Russell Crowe, stood out.  I thought Crowe had a stronger prescence then Pearce, but they were both good and I really wish that this movie would have been a jumping off point for their careers.  I really want to see more of them! Basinger was good too, worthy of her awards and worthy of a comeback.  I don't think this role was cliche for her because this time she played a blond with intelligence and motives and dimension. The script was great, with a few things that disturbed me and I accepted as part of the story.  The racism, characteristic of that era, and the corruption were effective enough to make me yell at the T.V. I thought people were kicking in doors too much, and shooting first/asking questions later. Lastly, the soundtrack was awesome.  The jazz sounds that played continuously throughout the film accented the story the way a soundtrack is supposed too. Many people compare this movie to films like CHINATOWN. I can't offer the same comparison because I haven't seen CHINATOWN and I don't know what it's about. But I think L.A. Confidential is a great movie without attaching it to a genre.  It's a great movie ""in itself.""",

After beating some Mexicans in the station buds partner is suspended because of ed's testimony. And Dudley assigned him for murder cases after telling him he's not suspended. There's a murder case after midnight and ed took the case. 6 people shot in the coffee shop owl night and one of them was stens who's the former partner of dick. And there was a young woman whom dick saw on a patrol with his former partner in a car with a broken nose next to a man in a car backseat and there was a woman in the car who bought some spirits (Kim Basinger). Ed couldn't be the only one in charge smith didn't let that happen both were in charge and the other detectives didn't like it as he's the snitch. And smith had already pinned the shootings on some black youngsters. And cohen the biggest mafia in la was arrested and his men was being killed one be one. Then dick found billy who's with the broken nose woman in the car and she was actually not beaten but had plastic surgery to look like movie stars because billy was the manager of those prostitutes including lyn who was in the liquor shop and in that car too and was also a prostitute. They captured the black guys and ed interrogated them masterfully. They went after an abducted girl after the interrogation and bud shot one of them and made it look like the naked black guy was going to shoot him and ed was furious. But then the black suspects run away from the station and ed found them in the adress of their drug supplier with another officer and the officer was down and ed killed the rest of the black guys. He became the shotgun ed. Sid and jack wanted to make news from a homosexual DA and used a young handsome man for this. He was reluctant but accepted it as he could become a movie star thanks to jack but jack found him his throat slit in the motel that he was supposed to be with the DA. ed and bud was aware of that the night owl culprits wasn't the black guys because the rape survivor Mexican girl told ed she testified accordingly because they wouldn't care about a Mexican girl otherwise. Then bud went to Susie's moms home and she said susie and his boyfriend who turned out to be stens was having an altercation with another man who was in the basement rotten and he turns out to be meeks the guy that bud had beaten in the car of pierce lyn and Susie. And also lyn and bud made love he's obsessed with her. Ed asked jack to work with him on the fleurs of the Lille case and jack asked in return to work with him on the guy that was killed in the motel case. Jack went to the house of smith to ask about sten and buzz meek the ex cop with bad reputation. Smith turned around and shot jack and carried his body to echo park. His last words was tomasi the nickname that ed made up for the man that shot his police father and got away with it. Smith after the jack case asked ed about if he knows about tomasi and ed knew it all it was him.

Both lured to a secluded motel by Dudley and several men of him confronted with both and ed was hurt . Everyone was killed and Dudley came up he wounded both but ed killed him the last minute and stopped being the exemplary detective. The problem was that buzz stole a large amount of heroine and had to be killed. Dudley was the one one who wanted to replace cohen. The last cover up was very sad. The police officers wanted to silence ed not to smear their names. But ed warned them this case needs more than one hero. The two deemed as heroes and ed was honored once again. He then went out to see lyn and bud they talked shook hands and both drove away leaving ed behind.,

At first he was seen as a whiney little brat just trying to get ahead. But slowly he began to earn respect with the other officers. And soon he was being known as shotgun Ed. I also liked Russell Crowe's character a lot too. The idea of a guy who goes around defending helpless women was an interesting addition and sometimes comical. For instance when the suspects from the night owl murder case begin to talk about attacking some girl Russell begins to tense up then BAM the chair in front of him snaps like a twig under the stress of his hands and he flies like a bat out of hell to try and learn how to save a girl in need.

424,24 August 1999,baumer,8," Hard to follow, Basinger is not worthy of Best S.A, the three male leads are incredible, overall a pretty good film","People say that this reminds them of Chinatown, I disagree.  I think it reminds me more of Tequila Sunrise.  Both have confusing plots, both are film noir in a way and both are richly acted and very well written.  What I enjoyed most about this was the excellent performances of Spacey, Pearce and Crowe.  All three carried out their roles superbly.  When Crowe( Bud White ) was mad ( which was quite a bit ) you could feel his anger.  It was written all over his face so that when he lashes out you understand why.  Spacey ( Vinsensse ) was a bit of a hotdog in the film but he slowly changes and eventually doesn't like what he sees in the mirror.  He also has one of the key scenes in the film when he discovers the main culprit.  When he utters the name of the man that supposedly killed Pearce's father, that gave me chills.  It was such a well written scene and carried out beautifully by Spacey.  I admired Pearce's character ( Ed Exley ).  He was not so much a political cronie as he did what he felt was right, all the time.  He had integrity and he never wanted to jeapordize that, for any reason.  That is why at the conclusion of the film I was left feeling strange when the denoument carried out the way it did.  Pearce shoots the bad guy as he walking away.  He didn't defend himself in the line of duty, but he killed a man that deserved to die.  This man was a cop killer, a murderer, a rapist and a man who thought he was above the law.  Does that make it right to shoot him?  I'm sure we all think so, but for Pearce to shoot him would have taken alot.  Asking moral questions the way the film did was one of its great strengths.",
425,2 July 2002,mattymatt4ever,9," A wonderfully entertaining, old-fashioned noir","I had to watch this film for my Film Noir class, and I'm glad I did.  I've seen the movie before, but I didn't remember much about it.  And I wasn't really in any attentive mood either.  Well, this time I was in an attentive mood and the plot fascinated me.  It's filled with all sorts of great twists and turns, reminiscent of the old film noirs.  If the movie weren't in color and didn't contain bloody violence or 4-letter words, it would be just like an old noir film.  ""LA Confidential"" pays tribute the great genre, and dazzles us with beautiful set decoration and costumes.  And to top it off, magnificent acting.  I heard about the studios being adamant (and it's mentioned in the ""Trivia"" section too) about casting two Australian actors as leads.  After all, this is an all-American detective story.  But Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce are so convincing and so great that you forget about that.  They hide their Australian accents remarkably, and they play out their roles just as magnificent as any American actor could.  And this is considering, the two actors were relative unknowns at the time.  So it put a smile on my face, knowing that they were still up-and-coming actors (in the states, at least) and hit it big with this one shot at stardom.  Crowe went on to more successful films like ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""The Insider.""  And Pearce went onto more successful films like ""Memento"" and ""Rules of Engagement.""  Kevin Spacey was also a relative unknown at the time--though not as much as Crowe or Pearce--and gives a cool performance as the suave Jack Vincennes.  I wouldn't put this performance up there with ""Swimming with Sharks"" or ""American Beauty,"" but this is also considering he didn't have much screen time.  James Cromwell as perfectly slimy as Captain Dudley Smith.  And Danny DeVito steals a few scenes as Sid Hudgens, the founder of Hush-Hush magazine.  I wouldn't say Kim Basinger deserved an Oscar for her performance as Lynn Bracken, the Veronica Lake look-alike hooker, but she was good.  Ironically, she's the only one in the cast who received an Oscar. She's sexy and convincing, but she doesn't possess the magic of the classic femme fatales. ",

429,27 November 2000,jhclues,10, Compelling Drama From Curtis Hanson,"A study of life in Los Angeles and corruption within the Police Force of the City of Angels in the early 1950's, `L.A. Confidential,' directed by Curtis Hanson, is an intense, compelling drama starring Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce.  It's a time of growth in Southern California; freeways are on the drawing board, glitz and glamor abounds in Hollywood, and there's a lot of money to be made, especially for anyone with the right connections.  But there's a dark undercurrent running throughout the city as well.  The criminal element is thriving under the auspices of gangster Mickey Cohen, and it's a time when certain officers of the law tend to mete out their own, personal brand of justice, which doesn't necessarily land them on the right side of the fence, nor of the law.  There's graft within the L.A.P.D., and a prevalent misuse of authority and lack of ethics that begins at the top, filters down and permeates the entire force.  And when Cohen finally goes to jail, a number of his `associates' begin turning up dead, and strange and untoward things begin to happen in and around Hollywood.  Finally, a nocturnal massacre at a place called the `Nite Owl Cafe' kicks off an investigation that ultimately involves two young officers, Bud White (Crowe) and Ed Exley (Pearce), and a veteran of the narcotics squad, Jack Vincennes (Spacey).  And it isn't long before the proverbial can of worms is wrenched open and, needless to say, many lives are soon destined to be changed forever. 	Working from an intelligent and extremely well written script (co-written by Hanson and Brian Helgeland, adapted from the novel by James Ellroy), Hanson delivers this tightly woven, intricate story with a deft hand and an eye for detail that transports the audience to another time and place.  At the heart of the tale are White and Exley, both of whom are passionate about their work and the pursuit of justice, though they differ greatly in their respective methods and basic perceptions of how things should be and why. And it's this contrast in personalities that becomes the impetus for the drama; what makes these guys tick, and which buttons can be pushed (and by whom) to get them going.  It's an examination of the complexities of human nature, and Hanson handles it all with skill and precision. 	If you hadn't noticed Russell Crowe before this film, you will forever after.  His screen presence here is explosive, and he brings an intensity to his character that is almost unsettling.  You can see it in his eyes; the turmoil lying just beneath the surface, ready to erupt at any moment.  You can feel it just watching him.  It's a dynamic, multi-layered performance that is unforgettable.  Guy Pearce turns in a notable performance as well, entirely credible and believable, though he lacks Crowe's charisma and presence.  But, admittedly, the character of Exley doesn't command the sympathy that White's does; White, despite his propensity for violent action, exhibits a vulnerability that is absent in Exley, who comes off as rather cold and inaccessible.  But again, it's the differences between these two that gives the movie it's momentum.  Kevin Spacey also turns in another outstanding performance as the slick, self-assured `celeb' of the force, Jack Vincennes, the cop whose ethics have become self-serving and who's lost sight of why he joined the department in the first place.  Spacey readily conveys the fact that there is more to Vincennes than meets the eye, which we discover as the story unfolds.  And it's when we learn what's hidden beneath the surface that we realize what a terrific job Spacey has done in bringing this character to life.  And, not to be outdone by her co-stars, Kim Basinger (Lynn Bracken) turns in a performance as a Veronica Lake look-alike that won her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. ",

Hanson and Helgeland achieved a manageable story from a book that could never have been adapted in the wrong hands. The acting is just superb. I am still stewing about all the people upset or surprised that Leonardo DiCaprio did not get nominated, what about the lead male cast members of LA Confidential? Kevin Spacey was sublime, as usual.

Especially when you watch it again ... and again! You find out details of this very smart told story that were not obvious at the first time and that get clear just after the third time watching it. You don't get enough from this film because Curtis Hanson had the sensibility to chose for a perfect cast that gives the book of James Ellroy what it actually is: a dark and brutal story of Los Angeles in the early fifties that only knows losers in all kinds of varieties. There is no good vs. bad. The good guys are bad, too and if you watch the development of the main characters played by Pierce, Spacey and Crowe along the movie you are very confused of not having one person in this movie you can really identify with.

Some didn't like Kim Basinger, but I think she was ideal for the part that she played. The theme of police corruption - those who are supposed to be the good guys but aren't - is a good setting for viewer involvement ...hint to budding scriptwriters out there.

462,8 December 2018,NORDIC-2,9," Freud, Karpman, and the Modernist Aesthetic","I just watched 'L.A. Confidential' again, after a long hiatus. It still holds up as an expertly crafted and vastly entertaining (though ultra-violent) neo-noir. This time around I was struck by the thought that 'L.A. Confidential' is a kind of classic Freudian psychomachia, with its three principal characters - Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), and Bud White (Russell Crowe) - embodying the three parts of the human psyche, as outlined by Freud a century ago. Jack, a suave operator and publicity hound, is clearly the Ego. Ed, who is educated, cerebral, prudish, and ethical, is very much the Superego. Bud, who is full of pain, rage, and lust, is all Id. A conservative critique of the American celebrity culture of narcissism just beginning to emerge in the early 1950s, the movie depicts Jack Vincennes as cynical, venal, and corrupt-at least until he has a change of heart and casts his lot with Exley in a crusade against an evil Establishment. Jack's death (murdered by corrupt LAPD Capt. Dudley Smith) two-thirds of the way through the picture allegorically signals the falling away of selfish egotism just as the late-stage alliance of Ed (the Official Hero) and Bud (the Outlaw Hero) signals psychological resolution for both characters, who then converge into one powerful force for Good (Ed overcomes his emotional and psychological rigidities and Bud overcomes his rage and grief as both men commit to battle a common enemy). There's a social class allegory here, as well. Ed embodies bourgeois ambition while Bud embodies working-class angst and despair. Their coming together figures for a uniting of the professional managerial class (PMC) and the working-class against a corrupt ruling elite: an unlikely occurrence in real life but deeply satisfying as a cinematic imaginary. One could also invoke Karpman's Drama Triangle here, especially in regards to the Bud White character. Victimized by his brutal father, who murdered his mother, Bud has become a perennial persecutor of woman-abusers and rescuer of woman-victims: an obsession that keeps him immersed in self-consuming melodrama until he turns his attention to a different kind of evil, i.e., the corrupt alliance between Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) and the city's heroin peddling gangsters.",

It is not my fault if the storyline isn't well exposed. Ask Martin Scorsese how to keep a viewer glued to his seat with a narration (CASINO). So the story is either weak or non-existing. I hate movies that take place during the fifties because the actors in their swanky suits feel authorized to overact. I said actors? Who are they? How much charisma do they have?

471,30 December 1999,Steviereno,10, A high moment in Hollywood's history.,"This is written over two years after seeing this remarkable film. Nothing I thought about it then has changed.  Two thirds of the way through my first viewing of ""L.A. Confidential"", it hit me that this was the single best American film I had ever seen.  I cannot put into words how disappointed I was when ""Titanic"" won ""Best Picture"" at the Oscars.  In any other year - other than in competition with the biggest blockbuster of all time (so far) - this movie would have walked away with the Prize. And it would have left everyone stunned at such an accomplished plot, with complex characters, twists and turns, and with an atmosphere as thick as Jupiter's. The multi-threaded plot is not your everyday Hollywood jump-from-character-to-character-and-scene-to-scene, but is absolutely vital to the viewer's descent into early-50s L.A.  The source of the evil underlying the story is a mystery to the viewer for much of the movie.  But it is not a mystery flick.  There is no atmosphere of whodunit, even though the viewer does  wonder who did do it.  But what ""it"" is isn't even made clear in one fell swoop, but is unfolded, peeled like an artichoke, layer by layer.  Who the bad guys and good guys are isn't even made clear for such a long, delicious time.",

He inhabits the brutish but generally good guy Bud White totally. And then of course there is Kim Basinger. She was great in Batman (1989) but here she provides that little bit of warmth, and calm.

Russell Crowe was just perfect character. Each crime scene had very good camera introduction. ""Rollo Tomasi"" was probably an original concept, because I never saw this particular verbal identification of such type of criminals in any other movies. I think any more words will turn this into a spoiler. So, Watch The Movie If you like action and mystery in crime scenario.

Upon first watching this film the first three or five minutes you think it might be a little doughy and over narrated by Danny Devito but it is'nt. I was speechless after watching. Everything is perfect. I hated Guy Pearce (Ed) in the start but by the end you fall in love with him by the end. Crowe is everything you want him to be. And Spacey is like the icing on the cake. Every actor is perfect and I really think nothing needs changing. If your a fan of this genre of movie this is sure to be your favorite as well as mine. Watch It Now!,

495,25 July 2012,Aly200,8, A Masterful Mystery Adventure,"James Ellroy's best-selling mystery has now been brought to the big screen and is one of the finest mysteries in cinematic history. The story follows three 1950s detectives in the legendary Los Angeles Police Department so completely different from one another; first is Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey, 2 time Academy Award winner), the technical adviser on 'Badge of Honor' and a Narcotics Officer, but accepts bribes from 'Hush-Hush Magazine' writer Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito). Next is Officer Wendell 'Bud' White (Russell Crowe in his first US film), a troubled man with a vendetta against wife-beaters due to a traumatizing event from his past where his mother was beaten to death by White's drunken father. Lastly is the young and ambitious Detective Lieutenant Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce also in his US debut), a young man following in the footsteps of his late father whose dedication to justice clouds his vision to what is about to unravel. The film also stars Kim Basinger (in an Oscar winning role)and James Cromwell. After a nighttime massacre claims one of the department's own, the three men are drawn together into the mystery involving murder, greed, prostitution and drugs. 'L.A.

Fully developed characters, perfect soundtrack, and enough plot twists and turns to keep you guessing from one minute to the next. You'll absolutely feel taken back to post-war Hollywood, and all of the drugs, crime, sex, and stardom (in several senses of the word) that went along with it. If you haven't seen it, please take my advice and do the following: watch the DVD at home, where you can pause as needed for bathroom breaks, etc. The plot is so intricate in this movie that if you miss so much as one small scene, you'll never be able to recapture the thread. Don't be daunted - this is so wonderful and fun to watch, you won't WANT to miss a minute.",

Let's see the plot: good/bad/lazy/corrupt cops + a very corrupt local administration... How is that going to ""shake"" or inspire the 2022 local/national administrations ???... Is it by promoting films of real good/bad cop stories & propaganda ?...
To sum it up: This is an awfully pathetic 'deja-vu'... E.g. Several Endeavour episodes got 'inspired' by this flick's ending plot... There's nothing new about corrupt police & administrations.

The acting is brilliant, the script is both at times entertaining and serious.

Kevin Spacey is his usual fabulous self as Jack Vincennes, a cynical cop, and Russell Crowe (""The Insider"", ""Gladiator"") is also riveting as Bud White.

507,26 June 2001,pschwart9,10, L.A. Confidential gives us all the goods...in a tasteful and original way.,"L.A. Confidential is a diamond in the rough. Slicing through the haze of contemporary Hollywood, Curtis Hanson presents a moral tale within the guise of a ""trashy,"" noirish crime mystery. This film sparkles because it satisfies the movie-lover (action sequences that are both exciting and original; heart-felt romance; the portrayal of strong but not infallible heroes) while it also plays out as a powerful morality tale. L.A. Confidential casts light on the sins of Hollywood and of all Americans: greed, lust, ambition, selfishness. The semantic elements of the film, notably the noirish atmosphere and obligatory gun-fights, reinforce the nostalgic feel of the film. We are taken back to the Classical Era of Hollywood, before the evolution of the big blockbuster. Like Grease, L.A. Confidential satisfies our yearning for a simpler time.",

Then, you have the character of Russle Crowe, the emotional who has no control over his feelings and his physical strength helps as well in solving the pieces of the puzzle, and finally the character of Guy Pearce who is smart, overly ambitious, and his jealousy which comes from his insecurity makes him act irrationally in a way different than that of Crowe.

519,19 March 2001,K-Slicer,10, The Best Movie Ever Made,LA Confidential is the Best Movie Ever Made.  I think it was robbed of Best Picture of 1997 at the Oscars.  Kim Basinger had the best performance in the entire movie as a seemingly cold-hearted prostitute who realizes the mistakes and is sorry later. She is my favorite actress and this is best performance to date.  The plot is really hard to understand at first but it is easier to understand with a second viewing.  This movie showed me that problems like drug dealing and corruption were relevant back then as they are now.  Curtis Hanson took a difficult to adapt novel and made a very edgy and twisted mystery thriller.  The cast is one of the most memorable in movie history.  The crew did a very good job in making a back lot studio look like LA in the 1950's.  LA Confidential is my personal favorite and one of the best movies ever.  I give it a 10!,

Main characters with more than one side to them that develop and act accordingly to make them seem very unique in the context of the story. The setting and visuals are superb neo-noir, with 1950s Los Angeles serving as a leisure backdrop to the story rather than overly stylized window dressing. The story itself is just a giant maze of corruption and scandalous events, as well as volatile police practices from the 1950s that leave zero guessing as to what kind of integrity police even had. Goldsmith's score is excellent as always.",

And for a while, it made sense. I've read books like ""Jurassic Park"", ""The Lord Of The Rings"" (which I'm currently making my way through) and even the ""Star Wars"" novels are exciting, if a little basic, books. So when I spotted the Elmore Leonard's original on sale, I purchased a copy almost wholly on the reputation of the film. Big mistake - the language and prose ran all over the place and I just couldn't get into it at all. It still lays around, unfinished and probably always will now that I have the movie on DVD.

Great plot, awesome atmosphere, great acting, great direction, amazing movie. Kevin Spacey rules, and so does Russell Crowe. Basically, everyone is well cast and does a great job, I don't think that Kim Basinger was the best, although she was the only one to get an award. Of course, that's because it was up for awards the same year as Titanic, and thus it had no chance, even though it is such a better movie, it almost makes me retch to compare the two.

Confidential is different, so allow me to present to you my third favorite film-noir.  Masterfully directed by Curtis Hanson, it IS, in my opinion, the best movie of 1997.  Kim Basinger's performance was definitely of Oscar-winning quality and I'm glad she won best supporting actress.  ",

528,29 March 2000,TaurusMSM,10, A classic in its own time!,"A classic in its own time!  L.A. Confidential is one of the most remarkable films ever created.  We follow the lives of three policemen in 1950's Los Angeles-Wendal ""Bud"" White, Edmund Exley, and Jack Vincennes. The police department is trying to clean up its image while staying in a corrupt town in a corrupt time.  Their reputation is however trashed once more in an internal drunken riot termed ""Bloody Christmas."" That's just the beginning, the spawn of the immense story, plot twists, and character development.  Each character in the film is drastically changed by his or her experiences.  The editing is always smooth and fast paced, and the cinematography always affixes the right mood.  The set pieces are distinct eye candy.  The soundtrack to this movie is a fine complement to the visuals.  It mixes authentic fifties music with a beautifully orchestrated score that keeps audiences on the edges of their seats. The acting performances for this movie are collectively some of the best ever produced for the silver screen.  The last time I've been this convinced of Characters was in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.""  Russell Crowe, Guy Pierce, Kevin Spacey, and Kim Basinger (Best Supporting Actress - 1997) give especially standout performances. Overall, L.A. Confidential is the total package.  It's superb at every angle.  It has been voted the third best film of the nineties by one critic's association, and it is my personal favorite.

The Television show is obviously supposed to be Dragnet. It's all an illusion, as we are to learn, because of the vast level of corruption of the city and the cities forces.

This is what took place when they made the movie in the late '90s, as they told a story of something that happened in the '50s and is still happening.",

All the performances in my opinion were oscar worthy especially that of an exciting new actor called Russell Crowe as he was virtually unknown when this film came out. The plot and relevant subplots are intertwined so well you wont notice them until the film has finished and you realise that the true evil has been staring you in the face. The ability to control so many mini plots at once without losing the audience is an amazing gift that is on display as all are equally interesting and equally important to the main story. when the film finishes you will stare at the screen and simply say wow!",

I noticed the way they changes step by step so the ending would be understandable easily. i was amazed by the craft and the way the screenplay was written. I still watch this movie to learn a lot about the screenplay. Very Good indeed. i think we should treat this movie as a new-noir, and we can notice that from the mood of the movie, the characters, the mix of right and wrong in them. i think there is a link between this movie and ""Chinatown"", it contain the same theme, and i mean the same city, the small crimes that leads to BIG crimes.

563,17 May 2012,edithsamson,9, Excellent!,"""L.A. Confidential"" is riveting from start to absolute finish. The interesting thing is that it is obviously set in Los Angeles; and I personally hate Los Angeles (I used to live there), but this is Los Angeles in a supernatural reality. There's nothing overtly amazing about this movie, but its almost as if you imagine every villain in this movie to be a demon (and the villains aren't always cut and dried, even the ""heroes"" are suffering from some type of pathos). In terms of my favorite Russell Crowe movie, this is it. I can't remember if they actually describe him in the movie as being all brawn and no brain; but that exactly describes his character. This is the first movie that I ever saw Guy Pearce in, and I fell in love with his acting ability. Kim Basinger is great too, and her acting is ironically understated. I lived in L.A. for quite some number of years, but this is an L.A. that I'm not really used to; but definitely like. There is a really strong visual component to the movie. Very vivid.",

Every actor in this film deserved some sort of award for their performance (many of the main actors have received an Academy Award at some point in their career. Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, Russell Crowe, and Kim Basinger...the film is a who's who of Oscar winners). ""L.A. Confidential"" is based on the book of the same name, and simplifies the book's plot considerably for the movie.  This, however, does not water it down at all since it is still a very riveting and exciting story.

568,26 January 2007,kreamykonez97,3, Slightly better than Jaws 4,"LA CONFIDENTIAL 1997 (KEVIN SPACEY, RUSSELL CROWE, KIM BASINGER) DIRECTED BY CURTIS HANSON ~ THE RUNDOWN: Apart from a juiced-up cast and a slick image, there is absolutely nothing worthwhile about this vastly overrated movie. ~ Okay, I saw LA Confidential right around the same time I saw Jaws: The Revenge, and I can honestly say without joking that this wasn't much better. To back up my outrageous opinion on this movie, I have comprised a list that I will present of why this movie sucks the big one. ~ 1) The premise of the movie is just plain dull! The basic story/concept is ridiculously stupid, boring and pointless, with almost no imagination whatsoever. Nothing of what we are offered draws us in therefore making the act of watching the movie a chore. 2) The script, like the basic story is just bland. Nothing in it has any redeeming value for the viewer; no wit or humor, not enough violence to make a stink; stale, washed-up dialogue...nothing that even begins to entertain. It is very muddled, however, and does succeed at purposely confusing us to try and hide up its retarded, brain-dead story until everything falls oh-so nicely into place for the breathtaking finale...ha, yeah right! 3) There's no originality here, and once you get down to it, this is really just another Tarantino/Pulp Fiction rip-off, not even a good one that. Except, of course, there's no Tarantino! Nope, instead you get the blazing originality of Curtis Hanson, Mr. Lifetime Movie himself. 4) Not an ounce of style is to be found anywhere in the general proximity of this movie. None. That's right, none. So what if it looks good visually? It doesn't even begin to innovate in story or otherwise. Sure, it tries embarrassingly hard to set itself apart with the whole Film-Noir B.S., but the only real category it falls into is your average, commercialized, Hollywood trash category. If you think there's style to be found here, maybe you have a sixth sense for it because I couldn't detect any. 5) For this fifth point, I will draw a comparison between the movie's cast and a baseball player named Barry Bonds...they're both on steroids. Yeah, basically, the overblown acting ensemble of the movie (Spacey, Basinger, Crowe, Devito, Straithairn, Pearce) is absolutely wasted. There are great actors in this movie but their skills are wasted and not challenged at all, making their performances meaningless. The roles that they play are generic and turn these fine actors into robots for the entire length of the movie. 6) Kim Basinger is effin weird. ~ In the IMDb.COM trivia section it says how this was supposed to be a TV show starring Kiefer Sutherland. Ha. Well, I am quite confident this particular episode of pointlessness and boredom would not have made the greatest hits compilation.",

Everything seems to be correct time wise. I am hoping that someone can help me. I need to know the name of the cowboy on the horse in the parade clip during the closing credits.

I've seen the film over a dozen times and every time I see it I realize something new (my level of the movie's understanding might be up to +/-95% by now).

Where the dialogue was a slick representation of what it meant to be an actor. Where the shadows and darkness was as pivotal to the movie as the lighting. The genre was Film-Noir, and for almost 2 decades, it lived and breathed prominately with other cinematic styles, aiming to thoroughly entertain audiences. During this era, there became far too many films to mention, that were both ultimately, and eternally recognized as classics. Almost 50 years later another film was added to this prestigious list.

It is gritty; it is a period piece with loving attention to detail; it is sordid; it has GREAT acting; it has twists and turns; it has a great cast! More than anything, it transports you to a time long ago, and makes you believe in it. I remember seeing the movie in the theater, and a week later couldn't remember the names of Russell Crowe or Guy Pearce (lol), but the film stuck with me. I also remember not understanding some things until watching a second time. Now it seems obvious, and just shows how perfect a script it is. Had 'Titanic' not been released the same year, 'L.A. Confidential' would have done better at the Oscars. I remember Kim Basinger promoting the movie on David Letterman. Her husband was releasing 'The Bear' at the same time. She said on the show something like, ""Come see my movie. Who cares about a dumb bear?"" 'The Bear' was simplistic next to this, and so Kim had a hard time 'selling' the film to the talk show audience. Our movie group loves coming up with trivia questions about this movie. Name the motel? The diner? The town Kim's character was from? We don't do that with 'Titanic', lol... 'L.A. Confidential' is one of the all-time greatest!",

GUY PEARCE played ED EXLEY as cop who puts his own career before anyone and anything, and he played the character with total realism. Now I bet your all wondering about RUSSEL CROWE well. even though I am very critical of him, his overall prowess in this film was remarkable. a contradictory character who hates women beaters yet kicks the sh*t out of kim basinger when he finds out she has shagged GUY PEARCE. the naughty slapper.",

Having multiple antagonists is fine, but the problem was it felt like two different stories that were weakly connected), characters that would like us to believe they are much more complex than the are (the white knight cop, Bud, who turns out to be a hypocrite. Some might take this cotradiction as character complexity, but the flaws of this character are never acknowledged in the form of facing consequences for you actions, bc in the end he gets the girl), and failure to address the theme of police corruption that it presents (Again, Bud is a thug of a cop, a dispicable person who is only ever rewarded by the film. Lieutenant Exley supposedly represents a moral reformer in the LAPD, but in the end he doesn't significantly change anything or really openly challenge the corrupt LAPD besides at the beginning when he testifies against a fellow cop for their violation of practice. He is also an unsavory person whose moral hypocrisy is never acknowledged).

After you first see it, you'll appreciate it, but not nearly as much as you do the 5th or 6th time. The truth is, the more you see it, the more you love it. It never gets old. I'm not someone who reviews movies by revealing the plot, but I will say that this has a fairly complex one, with many characters. (Another reason why you should see it multiple times) The acting is excellent, particularly by Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey. They make you love the characters, despite their obvious and sometimes extreme flaws. (Doesn't that make them more likeable?) The direction is incredible, as well as the script. They both make the film VERY well rounded and memorable. It's a shame that ""L.A. Confidential"" didn't win Best Picture, and it should have been nominated for twice as many awards.

Paparazzi waiting to get that one breakthrough picture. These are just some of the elements that make Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential one of the most exhilarating noir thrillers to reach the screen in recent memory. With a script that pays homage to the films of the '40s and '50s and may remind some viewers of the likes of Chinatown, L.A. Confidential proves that every period piece thriller doesn't have to go the way of travesties like Mulholland falls. It takes L.A. Confidential nearly two and one-half hours to spin its tale, but the time passes remarkably quickly. There's hardly a wasted moment in the entire movie, and director Hanson maintains tight control of every scene.",

However, thanks to the stellar cast, L. A. Confidential still attracts my attention for 2 hours. It begins by a mass shooting, and presents the appearing success of the cops. Then, all three characters, Guy Pearce standing for political smart, Kevin Spacey representing wicked intelligence and Russell Crowe for directness, found the weird cues of the case from various routes. They try to dig it further, but Kevin died unfortunately (his performance is second-to-none and I need to say his personality in this movie is the most multi-dimensioned).

The only reason I can see for the Oscar snub was that it was difficult to choose between them.  Spacey was awesome as he always is, but my choice would have been Crowe by a nose. But, what really sets this movie apart is the screenplay.  The dialogue is realistic and appropriate for the time.  The pacing is perfect, a rare feat for a movie significantly over two hours.  And the plot is intricate, yet decipherable if the viewer pays attention.  The audience is not insulted with constant explanations and pointers to the key moments, but the audience is also not confused by screenplay that loses itself in its own attempts to remain interesting and suspenseful.  The story unfolds like a perfect novel.  This is definitely the screenplay of the 90's, if not the film of the 90's.  Handing Cameron the Oscar for his over-budgeted, self-indulgent, poorly-acted waste of a good three hours was the crime of the 90's.",

Sure, some of the storylines and characters were left out, and it's not as dark, but the movie stays true to the spirit and atmosphere of its source. The casting was superb, and the entire ensemble is excellent, with Crowe, and obviously Spacey, the best of the bunch. I've since recommended it to many of my friends, all of whom really liked it.

The writing and directing are almost flawless and the best thing about the movie:  The art direction.  It was so perfect! The whole time I was watching, I actually thought it was 1953.  It absolutely blew my mind. Aside from the violence in some scenes, and some choice words in others, the film is almost for all ages.

There is something about this film that really gets to me I think the style is creative and visually appealing as well it has an old Hollywood look and feel that is really authentic.

As a fan of film noir this film entertained me perhaps more than it could people who aren't fans of the genre. The characters were handled brilliantly; at first we believe them all to be straight ahead characters: Ed Exley the slimy, but always clean cut, good guy, Bud White, a brutal thug who believes in violence as a way of stopping crime, and Jack Vincennes, a cop only there for the glamour. Eventually though, we see how their viewpoints change, and evidently, why they turned out the way they did. Aside from the characterisation of the film, the storyline itself astounded me. The many twists and turns came together at the end, leaving even the most tiny hint extremely important to anyone trying to work out the story. Overall, I loved this film for many reasons; the amazing story, the depth of the characters, the cinematography & music, which both conveyed a feeling of noir, the supporting cast (Danny DeVito, Kim Basinger, and James Cromwell were all great) and even, the small gleans of humour throughout, such as when Ed Exley confronts Johnny Stompanato and a Lana Turner look-a-like prostitute, only to find out, it actually is Lana Turner.

I rate it as one of my 10 best movies of all time.

649,22 July 1999,Buddy-43,10, One of the best films ever made,"There is something very unusual about L.A. Confidential in that, unlike in most features, there is no central character to be played by a well known Hollywood star.  Instead, the plot is driven by three cops in 1950s Los Angeles.  They are Bud White (Russell Crowe), Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey).  The former two actors are both Australian (Guy Pearce was in Neighbours back in 1990) and before this film were virtual unknowns in the movie business.  The fact that two of the leads are played by someone who the audience has never seen before is what makes them so fascinating and interesting to watch on screen.  They are both absolutely breathtaking as the two very different police officers and they seem very at home in the glitzy and glamorous atmosphere of the 50s that the movie creates.  As for Kevin Spacey - he too manages to surprise us with his laid back approach to the role of Jack Vincennes who is frequently called The Big V, a movie star among cops.  The storyline deals with a multiple homicide that takes place one night in a café.  Among the victims is a bent cop who had just been fired for starting a riot in the police station.  From here the story progresses through a number of twists but it is really about the relationship between Ed Exley, the by-the-book career climber and Bud White, the loose cannon psycho who has a thing for helping women.  Even if you don't understand all the numerous details of the plot (some of which can be quite hard to pick up on the first time round), the film is still incredibly watchable and tremendously exciting - partly because of the general feel of all the corruption, scams, gangsters and betrayal that existed in 50s LA.

I don't think they'll post it, so I'm writing this one.  I'll refrain from cursing and revealing too much. L.A. Confidential was the best movie made last year, no matter what the good folks at the Academy say.  As is the case this year(Saving Private Ryan the best movie made this year), the Academy gives the award to the wrong movie.  Oh well.  There's nothing you can really do. Am I ranking on Titanic?  No.  Titanic was an unbelievable movie.  It was spectacular.  But you have to remember that it's not necessarily cinema. More than half of the time, those actors and actresses were imagining that the ship was sinking and looking down at a blue screen.  Are there any blue screens in this one?  None that I can think of.  It's filmaking at its best. It's a classic.  Film noir reborn really. You've got all the classic elements of film noir.  The doomed heros who struggle with inner and outer demons, the femme fatale who knows more than you'd think, a corrupt system, interesting camera angles(like the one used when Bud goes to Patch Pierce's home.  The camera focused on Pierce, looking upward while in the backround is Bud, out of focus.  All of that good stuff.  I think that Kevin Spacey is great in the film, as is Guy Pearce and I have now forgiven the actor who played Bud White (can't remember his name) for the horrible sci-fi thriller Virtuosity.  Basinger, who won her first career Oscar, is...good?  I'm not sure on this one.  She does a good job.  Especially in her scene with Guy Pearce.  If you've seen it, you know what scene I'm talking about.  I just didn't get her motivation on things though.  She was the hooker with the heart of gold.  How stereotypical is that?  But that's what film noir gave us in the end. Stereotypes.  The hooker with the heart of gold was made a stereotype because it was made popular by film noir.  Did she deserve the Oscar? This is a great movie.  Watch it.  The ending might surprise you and also upset you, but it's a great movie.  It will probably be like Chinatown and last the test of time.

662,2 January 2002,QulkSiLvR,10," A stunning, captivating look at the corruption of the 1950s LAPD that proves that film noir masterpieces can still be made.","The Maltese Falcon.  The Third Man.  Double Indemnity.  The Killers.  All are brilliant pieces of film noir, cinematic masterpieces that envelope the viewer and make him/her wish that they too could be involved in the lives of the elegant cops, robbers, and everything in between that they watch...even if it means getting shot at, accused of anything and everything and, of course, beat up by crooked police officers.  All are also from the 1940s. Enter L.A. Confidential, Curtis Hanson's brilliant detailing of the corruption of the Los Angeles Police Department in the 1950s. From the opening credit sequence's Americana shots to the pinstripe suits, retrospective soundtrack, and oh-so Michael Corleone fedoras, the set and costumes are exquisite, mixing the glorious with the gloriously ugly and masterfully juxtaposing the glamour of the setting with its dirty, seamy underbelly. Russel Crowe (homicide), Guy Pearce (homicide), and Kevin Spacey (vice)are equally spectacular as the triumvirate of honest cops who go up against the baseness and big muscle of Los Angeles' rackets. James Cromwell plays police chief Dudley Smith to perfection, and Danny Devito turns in a solid performance as Sig Hudgens, the Hush-Hush magazine writer who is mixed up in something...we just don't know what. Kim Basinger is both gorgeous and utterly convincing in her rendition of the Veronica Lake look-alike prostitute who captures the hearts of a few too many people.

This film proves that a solid story, mucky morals and fantastic acting are important today. In a day when a poorly scripted film like Titanic can clear up at the Oscars at least we still have film-makers like Curtis Hanson. A genuine masterpiece.",
665,16 August 1999,reptyle,9, The movie that restored my confidence in Hollywood moviemaking.,"I love L.A. Confidential. When I saw it for the third or fourth time I realized my confidence in american (and especially Hollywood) movies had grown. A lot. Maybe it was the brilliant story weaved around colourful though stereotyphical characters, maybe it was the amazing complexity plot with subtle and surprising turns, the many ways to interpret the dialogue or simply the sharp edge it had towards Hollywood ideals, sort of hidden, set back in the fifties but aiming at the present as well. Maybe it was all of these reasons. It's a brilliant movie, go watch it!",
666,30 August 1999,suzie-13,10, One of the best movies ever made,"It should have won the Oscar for Best Picture the year it was nominated. A completely enthralling film full of outstanding plot, writing, acting and directing.  Definitely one the best movies I have ever seen.  I sat on the edge of my seat the entire time not knowing exactly where it was going. It is such an intense, powerful and memorable film.",
667,22 January 2000,withnail-11,9, I Hate Hollywood A Little Bit Less,"This film, like the one it gets compared to most often, ""Chinatown"", can be watched repeatedly and not become at all monotonous.  Almost all facets (writing, directing, costume, dialogue, etc.) are dead-on: if I had to pick a favorite, it would be James Cromwell's absolutely menacing performance as Dudley Smith.",
668,30 November 1999,pauljoyner,7, Pay attention....,"I thought this film stunk the first time around, due to the plot's confusion, which the editing was consistent with, and didn't even finish watching it as I recall. Then, I caught it on cable later and watched it for lack of anything else to do. It was pretty good! Sound kinda dumb? Well, YOU try it on and maybe you'll see what I mean. Even the second time, I felt the plot was so far out the film was salvaged only because of the fine cinematography and acting.....",
669,28 October 2001,doronzehavi,10, Second best of the 90's,"Second only to ""Lone Star"". A masterpiece of plot, acting and direction. Fell in the Academy Awards due to too many aussies on the set. Crowe was later compensated for a much grayer job in Gladiator. Pearce is yet to be compensated. Spacey is anyway the audience sweetheart.",
670,11 August 2002,kungfuju1212,10, greatest film noir of all time,"With the exception of Touch Of Evil, Chinatown and The Maltese Falcon, L.A. Confidential is the greatest film noir of all time.  Every aspect of the production is seamless.  The pacing is very much in the style of a Martin Scorsese film, endless series of montages perfectly edited to pop music. All the performances are excellent, and Curtis Hanson delivers his finest directorial effort.  Hanson and Brian Helgeland's oscar-winning screenplay is based on James Ellroy's novel (which they toned down a lot, I believe)",
671,22 October 2008,prafulkumarkashyap,9," want to watch titan sized actors clash in acting , then it doesn't get any better than this.....",this is the best cop film i have ever seen. i must say only in a few films it happens that every member of the cast fits perfectly for their roles. 3 of the finest actors in the industry fought to give a mind blowing performance.,
672,22 November 2021,patrickcheatle,1," Racist, sexist",For all the stunning L. A. Noir look and feel. This movie is undeniably racist and sexist there's no 2 ways about it. The film doesn't just reference the way things were in the past it excuses them and justifies them at every turn.,
673,30 October 2003,SeanSwan,8, Riveting story and polished acting,"Two detectives with radically different approaches to investigating crime become involved in a potentially lethal investigation exposing the sleazy underbelly of the 1950's police force. Superb acting performances by all, particularly Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce, who play rough cop and straight cop respectively. Beautifully filmed, evoking the spirit of the early fifties this film generates an electricity that entertains from beginning to end. Acutely deft script and intriguing plot. Rating 8/10.",
674,26 May 2005,greekpimp1515,10, LA Confidential is a great action thriller that shows corruption,"LA Confidential is one of the most drama filled movies i have ever seen. It is packed with action and different twists on the story. At one point, you think the three African Americans are guilty of the Night Owl shootings, but then we find out about the corruption in the Police Department. Also, everyone thinks that exley is a coward but then he wins over their respect and gets them to work for him. There is so much deception in the film. WE see the whole LAPD crumbling before our eyes and it is pretty exciting. It starts out with Exley ratting out his fellow officers, then we find out bud's partner was corrupt. After we find out that Sgt. Vinsennes is selling stories to the Hush Hush guy. It turns out that the captain is the one behind all the murders ans it takes Exley and BBBud to figure it out! What a great action film!",
675,18 May 2006,jsanchez396,8, This is one of the greatest film noir movies since the originals of the 1950's.,"L.A. Confidential is a really good movie that brings out each character's role. This movie had several nominations at the 1997 Academy Awards but the audience loved the Titanic which reduced the chances from winning a real award. I liked two characters in this movie which points out the ""good cop, bad cop"" theme. Russell Crowe who plays Detective Bud White, is a rough L.A. Detective doing whatever's necessary to bring justice in the streets of L.A., even if it means bending the rules a little bit. He is definitely ruthless and unsympathetic except for the women who were beaten up by their husbands. You can really feel the merciless character that Crowe plays in this movie. Another actor that gave out his best performance was Guy Pearce who plays the role of the character, Ed Exley, a detective who tries continue the legend that his father created and left for him. Not only he wants to continue his father legend but he want to be way better than him as in following the rules of the law and not being as ""hardcore"" as Detective Bud White. He is the one who plays the good cop who feels it's not necessary to bend the rules to clean up the city from scum. These actors as well as the movie should be recognized throughout the history of film making.",
676,22 July 2016,ntsuhi,7, Overrated!,I found it overrated! I think there are many other movies that should be in top 250 list. Probably three great actors starred in this film that is why it is in the list. Kevin did a very good work though I must admit. But Russel was not suitable for the role I guess. People might have different opinion. But honestly I didn't think it is a great movie. The story was a bit shaky. I saw in the reviews that many people found this movie fantastic. I don't think it is THAT great. It is an average movie. I expected more from this film. I love Guy Pearce. He is a very good actor. He did a great job I must say! I loved his acting here. He was totally into the character. The only thing I loved about this movie was Guy Pearce.,
677,18 August 1998,Number 8,10, A Must See!,"This film was so great. The story, acting, dialogue all add up to an unforgettable film. Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce are two fine actors, and I look forward to seeing them in more films.",
678,20 June 2008,artnathan,10, Great but I liked Chinatown better,"With the thermometer at 112 at home today, it was a good day to watch a movie or two. I hadn't seen LA CONFIDENTIAL in several years and caught Chinatown only a week ago. Both are excellent films, 10 points from me, but I preferred Chinatown. Both are outstanding films dealing with corruption in high places, albeit in two different eras, the 1950's for LAC and the 1930's for Chinatown. Others have said that this film would have done better in a different year, having to compete with Titanic & others and grossing only $55 million or so. In the end it's just an excellent corrupt cop movie that could have been set in Chicago or New York with only minor changes in the characters. Don't get me wrong, I truly enjoyed LA CONFIDENTIAL but Chinatown is truly exceptional and will stand the test of time far better than it Los Angeles based counterpart.",

681,26 April 2002,Koop-4,10, One of the Greatest Crime Films of all Time!,"THE PLOT: LA Confidential is based in the seedy Los Angeles of the 1950s. It is the story of three cops; Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is a celebrity cop, always out to make a buck catching famous people using drugs with the help of a sleazy gossip magazine writer (Danny DeVito) and is the consultant on a police drama TV show. Officer `Bud' White (Russel Crowe) is a rough and powerful brute, a hater of woman beaters who is not afraid to deliver his own brand of justice. And Detective Lieutenant Edmund J Exley (Guy Pierce) is the force's golden boy, who'll do anything to get ahead, as long as it's by the books. These three very different men are drawn into the investigation of a mass murder in the Night Owl, an all night diner. But not everything is as it seems as further revelations involving the Chief of Detectives (James Cromwell), a rich millionaire (David Stratharn) and a Veronica Lake look-alike call girl (Kim Baisinger) ensure the case is not easily filed away.",

684,9 October 2000,fair80,8, better than the book,"I recently read James Ellroy's novel, and could not see how they could make a movie of it. It's huge and has three major plots. When I read the synopsis here on imdb, I rented the film. My husband, who has not read the book, and I both gave it an 8. The major plot line involving a Disney-like person that was discarded was no loss. It was a bit over the top. The movie is better without it. The characters were very true to the book, and I thought Kim Basinger was very good, but too old for the part. She's supposed to be about 28. Russell Crowe looked like a kid next to her.",
685,27 February 2000,EvilJesus,10, Robbed by Titanic,"I was appalled watching the oscar ceremony in 1998. Not because Cameron asked for a minute of silence (something even Spielberg didn't request for the holocaust after winning for Schindlers List) and not because I knew LA Confidential wasn't going to sweep the acting awards like it deserved because neither Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe or James Cromwell were nominated. I was shocked and stunned that LA Confidential was beaten to the top oscars by Titanic. It was a truly undeserving victory. LA Confidential has some seriously heavyweight acting performances. Right through Danny DeVito and Kim Basinger who did win for her performance as Lynn Bracken. Russell Crowe is simply brilliant there are no other words to describe him. Kevin Spacey is every bit as good in this as anything he's done before or since it. I can't recommend this movie enough.",
