0,19 January 2006,claudio_carvalho,10," The Most Impressive, Depressive and Realistic Dramatic Movie about the World War II","""Der Untergang"" is certainly the most impressive, depressive and realistic dramatic movie about the World War II ever made. I have never seen a film picturing the insanity of Hitler in his very last days in a bunker in Berlin with his high command, and how the German people were hypnotized by him like in this film. Last year, I saw the deceptive, boring, pretentious and overrated ""Molokh"", showing a caricature of Hitler and Eva Braun in Bavaria. But ""Der Untergang"" is awesome and comparable to ""Apocalypse Now!"", my favorite movie of war.",/
1,24 August 2005,Galina_movie_fan,9," ""You have to feel that Hitler was a human being; only then he is a real horror.""","The first internationally released German production to feature Hitler as a central figure, ""Downfall"" (2004) takes place in the dismal gloomy Berlin during April - May 1945 in anticipation of the inevitable German defeat. The film shows the last days of Hitler and those close to him through the eyes of his young secretary, Traudl Junge.",r
2,21 April 2005,The_Void,8, A magnificent piece of cinema. Spectacular in every respect,"Truly great movies are few and far between these days; but Der Untergang most definitely represents one of those rare occasions. Oliver Hirschbiegel, who brought us the wonderful 'Das Experiment' has produced a film that is very nearly perfect. Depicting the final ten days of Hitler and the National Socialist regime, Der Untergang or 'The Downfall' to give it it's English title is an expose of failure and the way that a madman can bend a whole nation into doing his bidding. The film is very realistic, and an excellent ensemble cast breathe life and believability into the roles of the various members of the Nazi party and because every performance is picture perfect, the whole thing comes together brilliantly as one whole piece. Bruno Ganz gives the central performance as the Fuhrer himself and it is one of the greatest performances I've ever seen in a film. His portrayal of Hitler in the middle of his downfall is absolutely perfect, and Ganz excellently portrays the man's every emotion. It must be difficult to play such a notorious character as Hitler himself, but Ganz rises to the occasion and gives it his all.",e
3,19 March 2005,jotix100,10, The last days at the bunker,"This magnificent film goes where no one else dared to go to show us the last days of Adolf Hitler. The director, Oliver Hirshbiegel, working with a big cast, brings to life the madness of the last days of the monster, as observed by a young and impressionable secretary who witnessed most of the crisis.",v
4,18 January 2005,Coventry,10, A mesmerizing experience and one that will hopefully remind people all over the world that history may never repeat itself!,"All I can say about ""Der Untergang"" is: WOW! This is one of those rare films that prove that the darkest pages in our world history easily surpass the fiction tales of the most imaginative fantasist. This soon-to-be landmark in cinema portrays the final ten days of Hitler's reign at the well hidden bunker in Berlin. In the opening sequences, we see how the Führer hires Traudl Junge (flawless performance by Alexandra Maria Lara) as his personal secretary and we largely witness the rest of the story from her viewpoint. Recent documentary footage with the real Junge is showed to audience at the end of the movie, stressing even more that this is a very intelligent and carefully elaborated production. A form of criticism I often encountered stated that Hitler was portrayed too ""human"" by the Swiss actor Bruno Ganz. Let me tell you that people who claim this haven't got the slightest clue what they're talking about! It's true that Hitler sometimes strokes his dogor even gives a compliment to his servant for cooking him such a lovely dinner! But only moments after, you're exposed to the real Hitler again! Alternately a mad-raving dictator, a disillusioned conqueror or simply a pathetic old man. But perhaps the most astonishing scenes in ""Der Untergang"" are the ones in which the persons close to Hitler  either professional or amicable  remain unconditionally loyal to him! It is deeply disturbing to behold how so many people blindly swear by the unworldly beliefs of a madman, even prepared to follow him into death. This accurate portrait results in a series of brilliant sequences with the severely shocking fate of the Goebbels family as an absolute highlight.",i
5,21 August 2005,wforstchen,10, This Historian is awed by the effort for accuracy,"I teach a college course on WWII, in graduate school studied under several experts on the subject and have interviewed numerous survivors on both sides. This film comes out on top, perhaps the finest ever made on the subject of the war (though the Belorussian ""Come and See"" & ""Schindler's List"" are darn close as well).",e
6,5 June 2005,ilovedolby,10," A deeply disturbing, intimate portrait of the insanity of Hitler and the blind faith of his followers at the end.","In recent years, war films have given a new exposure to the sheer nature of war. In ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" we were exposed to the realities that a soldier endures not only on the battlefield, but what they take with them long after the battles end. However, ""Downfall,"" a German film nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2005 Oscars, brings a unique perspective to the table. It is about the last days of Hitler and the Third Reich and the ultimate demise of both. More so than a war movie, this feature exposes the insanity of Hitler and the blind faith of his followers at the end. It is a deeply disturbing, intimate portrait of the cruelty that he inflicted not only upon 6 million Jews, but ultimately on his own countryman at the end.",w
7,13 March 2015,planktonrules,10, Very important historically but not for the faint of heart,"This film is based on the experiences of Hitler's secretary as well as other survivors of the bunker during the final days of Nazi Germany. It follows these people (with a strong emphasis on Hitler through the first 80% of the film) and excels at its historical accuracy. Unlike some of the other Hitler biopics (such as the ones starring Richard Basehart and Alec Guinness), this one shows an odd and 3-dimensional man--screaming and irrational one moment yet rather kind and likable the next. If Hitler had ONLY been a screaming madman (as he's generally shown) no one would have followed him and he never would have led Nazi Germany. Here he is much more believable and the writer, director and actor (Bruno Ganz) all created the best screen Hitler to date. ",/
8,24 November 2004,nosiesnetnieuws,10," Impressive achievement, realistic and shocking","This film definitely is a must-see because of the incomparable degree of realism displayed in it. Direction, camera and acting are of an unparalleled level and make you, as the viewer, feel as if you are actually in Berlin, 1945, and in the FÃ¼hrer's bunker. The film does not provide any commentary or judgment, it just shows facts.",r
9,28 March 2006,rmax304823,8, Unforgettable,"I tuned in late to this film, not expected very much, because we have all I suppose seen so many documentaries of Hitler's last days in the bunker, and a reconstruction with Alec Guiness thrown in for good measure. Many of these presentations depend on interviews with Trudl Junge, Hitler's secretary at the time. Her descriptions of the goings on during the final days are cool, precise, and dispassionate. First Hitler said this, then Eva Braun said that, and then they went up into the garden. A human surveillance camera who seems to have no personal mechanism for judgments.",w
10,12 November 2004,hermes-10,9, Amazing realism,Der Untergang makes you live the horrors and craziness of war. Bruno Ganz's interpretation of Adolf Hitler is worthy of an Oscar. He is completely believable. Also the rest of the cast performs admirably. You feel transported to Berlin as it was bombarded by the Russians. You get a very clear insight (or an impression?) in how the military decisions were taken during those final days of the war. The movie balances well between large-scale effects of bombs exploding in ruined streets and depictions of different persons going though the experience  from Hitler and his staff in the well-protected bunkers to the principal military commanders torn between reason and loyalty and German civilians trapped in an inferno. The movie is neither pro-Nazi nor does it depict all Nazis as mindless monsters. It gives an impression of utter realism. Go see it in a good cinema  your seat will tremble as the bombs explode. A nine out of ten.,1
11,15 February 2005,philip_vanderveken,10," It's amazing and unbelievably realistic... Go see it people, NOW!!!","Having a huge interest in both World Wars and all that happened during the time period 1910-1950, I've seen a lot of movies and read even more books on the subject. Name me a more or less realistic war movie and I've probably seen it, so when ""Der Untergang"" was first released in Germany, I already knew I wanted to watch it as soon as it would be released over here. The commotion that it caused, the good critics that it got, all made me look forward to the day that I would see it, but really nothing could prepare me for what I saw... It was amazing, it was great, it was jaw-dropping...",3
12,29 December 2005,ma-cortes,8, DOWNFALL is essential and indispensable watching for outstanding performance by Bruno Ganz,"The film deals with the history of Hitler's last days in underground bunker , it's the true story of the historic downfall and death (at age 55 in 1945) of the infamous Nazi dictator's culprit of death of 50 million people during second war world and killing of 6 million Jewish in concentration camps . The Fuhrer's last few tortured days in his underground bunker against a Berlin background . Hitler had height five feet , seven inches , eyes black , hair black , shaggy locks hung over forehead , complexion sallow , wide mustache , various hairs on each side ; besides he had marked devotion to brown shirts and old trench-coat and always surrounded by armed thugs and expert gunmen . He had demented gaze with tendency to become hysterical on slight provocation with delusions , particularly upon his place in history and his powers over vast numbers of people and addicted to public hysteria on race purity , and known to throw himself on the floor and gnaw rugs, guttural voice apt to rise to shrill tones when excited or thwarted . He was a congenital liar suffering from dreams of persecution . Almost all these physical descriptions and particulars of Hitler are perfectly incarnated by Bruno Ganz who even studied Parkinson's disease patients in a Swiss hospital to prepare for his role . Thus , he magnificently plays him as a sadistic , malicious , dangerous , vengeful, mystical and maniacal man .",1
13,24 July 2006,Buddy-51,8, grimly fascinating film,"Ever since his death in a Berlin bunker at the end of World War II, there has been endless speculation and conjecture surrounding the final days of Adolph Hitler and his long time mistress Eva Braun. A few years back, a documentary entitled ""Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary"" interviewed one of the few people who claimed to be an eyewitness to those events, a young woman hired to take dictation for Der Fuehrer for the last two and a half years of his life. ""Downfall"" is a dramatized account of what she saw.",9
14,10 February 2009,Marx_Bros_Fan86,10, Probably the most accurate WW II movie I have ever seen,"A lot of war movies have a sense of patriotism or commercialism, but Der Untergang feels like it is just giving you the cold hard facts of the last ten days of the Third Reich. I have to commend the filmmakers for not using black and white or filtering the color, like many other WW II movies today. It is becoming a cliché. The film is based on Traudl Junge's recollections of the last ten days she spent in Hitler's Bunker. It takes place entirely in the Bunker, which gives the film a very claustrophobic feel. As the outcome of the war becomes clearer, the Bunker becomes a cesspool of drunkenness, denial, and even death.",7
15,26 October 2016,Prismark10,10, Hitler's last days,"Downfall is an enthralling film that examine the final days of the Nazi hierarchy ensconced in their bunker. It is a war story I have never encountered before, the German view of the last days in 1945. As the war is lost we see the Nazis throwing their own citizens in peril as the red army takes control of Berlin.",0
16,19 May 2006,Jdylan-1,10, One of the Best Movies I've Ever Watched,"Seriously, I wasn't expecting much, but this was one of the best movies period. The actors and acting was terrific, the sets were incredible (St. Petersburg, Russia), the emotions... I felt like I was in Berlin during the last few days, I felt like I was in the bunker with Hitler. It is the most realistic depiction of the situation I had ever seen, and I almost felt a tear in my eye. And that is something, coming from a 40 year old Army veteran. The last 5 minutes, I was on the edge of my seat, when the Russians showed up. Anyway, this movie is totally recommended by me, but brush up on your Nazi history first, or you won't know who is who.",3
17,12 November 2004,engelst,7, Distanced and sober view of Hitler's last days,The first 15 minutes made me doubt the qualities of this movie. The situations were a bit forced and the cuts were strange. But after the uncomfortable beginning the movie took momentum and kept it until the end.,/
18,18 September 2007,ccthemovieman-1,8, 'Grim' Look At The Nazis' Final Hours,"Wow, what a grim movie. How I stuck with this for 155 minutes, I don't know, but it's a fairly involving story once you get into it and you want to see how it's all played out.",?
19,6 January 2008,Theo Robertson,8, Compelling But With One Serious Flaw,"Watching DER UNTERGANG is something of a unique experience for me . It's not often I'd go out of my way to watch a foreign film , far less one that is often talkative and where the outcome is in no doubt . Even more remarkable is the fact that I sometimes rewatch this movie from start to end unable to take my eyes off screen . The reason ? It's one of the few films where the acting is truly compelling ",r
20,22 April 2005,theantigaz,9, The End,"Now here is a novel idea, making a movie from the ""enemy's"" point of view, attaching a human face to probably the most notorious institute of evil in human history. Before watching this film, I had reservations over how much I would enjoy it and what I might gain from it. I was concerned that the film may be an attempt to show the human side of the Nazi party, to make us sympathetic not to their cause, but to their human nature. I had to think to myself, do I really want to attach a human element to people who history has painted as monsters? The film begins with Hitler recruiting Traudl Junge as a new secretary in 1942, from this point onwards the film is predominantly (but not entirely) seen through her eyes. This key scene at the beginning of the film shows how people reacted to their leader with fanatical loyalty, holding him high in reverence. This gives us a brief insight into the belief of his followers that what they were doing would lead them to a golden utopia, a better world. All to often in films concerning Nazi's, they are portrayed as evil personified, killing for killing's sake, being evil for the sake of being evil. What we get throughout this film is a more realistic viewpoint of people's attitudes. The people who followed Hitler may have no entirely agreed with everything he said, may have not hung on his every word, but believed that he would lead them to a greater future, as such they followed.",e

22,29 June 2008,joachimokeefe,10, 'Saving Private Ryan' without the schmaltzy overtones.,"You couldn't really expect to make a 'typical' movie out of the story of last days of the archetypal fascist dictator. 'Untergang' seeks to illustrate the situation of 'sane' people under the control of a madman; that and the impending arrival of the Red Army is the only dramatic jeopardy available - no romantic interlude, nothing to achieve, no sentimental buddy rescue shtick. We witness the reactions of people like you and me (and don't be silly enough to imagine I include Goebbels, etc. - I mean people doing their jobs under impending calamity) who happened to be in the wrongest place at the wrongest time. If this dilemma doesn't absorb you, it's a fault of your imagination, not of the utterly brilliant recreation of something very few people survived to bear witness to. 'Untergang' doesn't seek to make a judgment of Hitler because it doesn't need to: all you need to appreciate is his increasing detachment from reality and the way that this divides the people stuck with him. If there's any sort of judgment, it's of the herd mentality of people as a whole. The film becomes a series of stunning docu-vignettes of the various levels of humanity involved, each one posing the question 'What would YOU have done?'. This film is thought-provoking, and that naturally makes many denizens of the internet uncomfortable.",_
23,21 June 2012,cowboykalira,10, Just to set the record straight,"I feel the praise of this movie has been sung many times already on this site, so I will not go into all that it does right. However, after reading some of the reviews that are rightfully in the back pages here, I do think there is an issue that needs to be addressed here.",=
24,12 November 2004,SithApprentice,10, Impressive,"Considering the fact how hard it is to make an adequate movie about the  Third Rich and especially Hitler himself, ""Der Untergang"" is a superb  portrayal of the last days of Hitler, his minions and the Third Rich.  First of all, Bruno Ganz' performance is magnificent, brilliant,  perfect. You're beginning to think he IS the Fuehrer, his look, his  mannerism, his sick philosophy of life and his downfall are absolutely convincing. After seeing him you can finally understand why  so many people back then were attracted by his charisma, but thanks to  Ganz' performance you do not forget about the terrible crimes he  committed by his followers and about the evil inside the sick soul of  this man. His minions weren't that important in this movie, except for  Joseph Goebbels and his family. Heinrich Himmler, the ReichsfuehrerSS,  was portrayed as the man he was: an idiotic coward, who was in great  part responsible for the Holocaust and still believed in a peace  agreement with the allied forces, although this idea was completely out  of place. Albert Speer as one of the less criminal national socialists  was also quite good interpreted. Martin Bormann, Alfred Jodl and  Wilhelm Keitel, 3 other important Nazis, got too few screen time, and  Hermann Goering didn't even show up, he was just mentioned. I think  Goebbels wasn't portrayed that authentic as he could have, due to the  fact he was the most intelligent of Hitler's inner circle, but in some  scenes he seemed like someone who could just repeat his own slogans.  The part about Traudl Junge and the boy from the Volkssturm, Peter, was  also quite good, but it was clearly overshadowed by the Hitler/ minion  part. There are also some surprisingly well done battle- sequences  taking place in Berlin, in which you can also see a part of the pretty  high amount of blood and violence, for example when a soldier gets shot  through his head, some officers are committing suicide or the killing  of the Goebbels children, a scene which gave me the chills. Due to it's  high authenticity, great actors and an important message, this movie  could become as important as Schindler's List already is, in order to  show today's youth the insanity of Hitler and the whole Third Rich and  to make them avoid racist and extreme right wing organisations. All in  all, this is one of the best German flicks I've ever seen - although  there isn't such a huge number of good German movies. 10/10",t
25,31 December 2005,dromasca,9, best docu-drama in years,"I got to see 'Der Untergang' only now, on DVD, but maybe this is the right format for it. The film is a docu-drama, with all the goo things and the limitations of the genre, and as a docu-drama is better to be seen on the small screen than in a theater.",t
26,21 June 2008,DarthVoorhees,10, One of the great modern epics and one of the most haunting films ever made,"Downfall is a film not without it's flaws but I feel it is one of the most important films I've ever seen. It is so accurate and so unbiased in it's portrayal of Hitler and the final days of his Reich that we get to see the man behind the monster and the people who have sold their soul to him. Nazis weren't beacons of pure evil, they were human beings and Downfall takes this to heart. I remember the film received some criticism upon it's release for being ""sympathetic"" to the Third Reich, sympathy is not the emotion Oliver Hirschbiegel is trying to inset in his audience, I felt he wanted them to develop a sense of understanding.",_
27,8 April 2005,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, A chillingly accurate portrayal of Der Führer and the fall of The Third Reich,"Adolf Hitler. The very name is enough to send a chill down your spine. Not because of what it is or was, but because of what it stands for, what we involuntarily and immediately think of when we are reminded of him. The deaths of so many people and the cause of so much evil. Now, almost sixty years after his death, we finally get a chance to see his downfall, his last hours and days... and this turns out to be a very revealing portrayal. Oliver Hirschbiegel takes what so many people have tried to turn into a monster and makes it human again, makes us believe that this man actually existed and was a man, not a beast. We see Hitler's frustration at defeat, his kindness to his employees, his refusal to accept the truth. The plot is very good, and almost completely authentic. I could only find two historical inaccuracies in the film, and that is incredible, compared to the amount of stuff that was as if taken directly from the history book or another equally reliable source. The pacing is great. I was hardly bored at any point during the film, despite it being quite long and the language spoken was one I couldn't understand(thank god for subtitles). With that said, I have to applaud this film's realism and authenticity. Every single German character in the film speaks German. There are a few scenes with Russian characters as well... and they naturally speak Russian. Not English with a poorly faked accent, like we generally see in Hollywood films. In fact, there is not really any Hollywood in the film. Just gritty, hard realism. No heroic acts that are rewarded. No 'fireball' explosions. No holding back on injuries, even when it comes to 'our heroes'. Actually, that's probably what impressed me the most(when it comes to non-Hollywood stuff in this film); there are no heroes. No one is raised above the rest, no one is pure, good and true *all the time*... no one is a hero. Everyone is a human being. The acting is flawless. Bruno Ganz is a perfect choice for Adolf Hitler. No, scratch that; THE perfect choice. You forget that you're watching an actor. You're completely absorbed by his performance. The casting was mostly spot-on, with most of the historical characters looking and acting just like they did in real life. The details are another thing that raises this film to a new level. The tiniest little things in these people's lives, the most human and typical things are presented as they are or were, in the film. Hitler's Parkinson's disease, Goebbels' slight limp, etc. Smaller details include a soldier quickly rubbing his eyes of soot and gunpowder before looking through binoculars and a brief dialog showing Hitler and his promises' effect on many Germans, even children. This is just so talented directing, it's hard to say anything negative. The editing is sharp and the cinematography is perfect. Not one shot lasts too long or ends too early. A few things were changed(from the historical record of what happened) for dramatical reasons, but it didn't bother me and probably won't be a deal-breaker for anyone else(it really shouldn't, anyway, except maybe for historians who go for nothing but authenticity and accuracy). The one thing I will say is that no one should go see this movie unless they are absolutely certain of what they're in for, when it comes to violence and realism. This is gratuitous and detailed, no holding back. Not for the faint of heart. Definitely not. Also, you will need somewhat extensive knowledge of Hitler and the people around him in that time, or you won't really understand what is going on. Read up on him or watch a Discovery Channel special first, then watch the film. I recommend this to just about anyone who can tolerate the language(I don't know if there is a dubbed version of this film, but in my honest opinion, you should stay away from any other version than the original) and the violence, and, most importantly, the idea that Hitler was a human being, not some supernatural, cold-hearted monster. 10/10",u
28,1 April 2016,ironhorse_iv,9," This movie has great insight on the final few days of Adolf Hitler's reign over Nazi Germany in 1945. It's a watch must for anybody, curious about WWII.","Downfall is an early 2000's foreign language movie with English subtitles, probably best known for most people, as the movie where the Angry Hitler internet parody meme came from, where Adolf Hitler (Bruno Ganz) rants about modern, often trivial topics. For me, I saw the movie, as more than that; it's a haunting masterpiece of a historical World War 2 reenactment of a very important date in world history. Based upon the books: 'Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich', by historian Joachim Fest; 'Until the Final Hour: Hitler's Last Secretary', the memoirs of Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge; 'Inside the Third Reich', the memoirs of Albert Speer, one of the highest-ranking Nazi officials to survive both the war and the Nuremberg trials; Hitler's Last Days: An Eye–Witness Account by Gerhard Boldt; Das Notlazarett unter der Reichskanzlei: Ein Arzt erlebt Hitlers Ende in Berlin by Doctor Ernst-Günther Schenck; and Soldat: Reflections of a German Soldier, 1936–1949 (1992), Siegfried Knappe's memoir. The mixer of all these source materials, was good enough to nominate for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2004. While, the film directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel takes some liberties on the source materials, by changing Traudl Junge's (Alexandra Maria Lara) escape, Albert Speer (Heino Ferch) meeting with Goebbels family, and how Heinrich Himmler (Ulrich Noethen) met his end. Despite these dramatic licenses, the film generally shows an accurate view of events. Much of the framing is taken from contemporary photographs and newsreels—one of the movie posters is basically a staged version of the very last picture ever taken of Adolf Hitler. It show, how well-shot, this film is. I just wish, director Oliver Hirschbeigel had more passion for this film. I get that, he wanted to direct 2004's 'Blade: Trinity', instead. However, I don't think, that film would had works well, with his style. Plus, his contract stated that he couldn't leave the project and had to direct 'Downfall'. Despite that, the accuracy and details that Olivier Hirschbiegel put in the film really helped viewers get into Hitler's frame of mind and what it must have been like living with him for his last few days. This also helps by one of the best acting, I ever saw in a World War 2 film. Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler, was amazing. It's really shows that he takes his role, very serious by preparing four months of research on Hitler such as showing the effects of the Parkinson's disease and listening to Hitler's secret recording in Finland. It's superb how well, he imitate Hitler's mannerisms and speech patterns. It's no wonder, why his performance was almost universally critically acclaimed by everybody. He was at his best, during the scene where he talks about his dream for Germania (The Nazi New Capital). This scene in the film helps the viewer get a sense of how Hitler lost touch with reality towards the end of the war. Glad, they didn't make Hitler or his followers into a sympathetic figure, at all! The film also powerful in the way, they show the blind devotion of the Nazis, even during Hitler's insanity, by capturing, their violence acts, through many disturbing suicides, commitments, and fighting scenes even knowing they had lost the war. These events become very somber, when children are involve in the fight. It's really shocking to hear, how many of these mad men deprive their little kids of their lives. Because of that, this movie is hard to watch for some people. Another thing, I felt was a little jarring is the overtype supporting cast, actors such as Thomas Kretschmann and Ulrich Noethern. Not only does they play Hermann Fegelein & Heinrich Himmler in this film, but they are no strangers in playing roles concerning Nazis. Most of their filmography are roles like this. While, it's no fault of the film, it just something that hard, not to notice. Another is the interview samples of real Traudl Junge toward the end. I don't like it was taken from the 2001's documentary ""Blind Spot"". It felt out of place, from the majority of reenactment scenes, however it was short enough to care, too much about it. So you can call that, a nitpick from me. Overall: This provocative look at Hitler's last days barely has any faults, besides being grim and somber. While, this film isn't for everybody, due to the graphic violence and language, it's best viewed by very mature people who've had studied World War 2, and are prepared to ponder complex questions about what makes, the darkest, most brutal men in human history into the monsters, that they would soon would become. It's a character study movie, for anybody curious about how the Holocaust, and the War in Europe was able to end.",r
29,9 March 2005,Quinoa1984,10, One of the best foreign films of the year,"Quite simply, the story of Downfall is of the final days of the third Reich, held up in a bunker in the center of Berlin, as Adolf Hitler and his closest minions go deeper into the hole they've dug for themselves (told through the perspective, for the most part, of Hitler's last secretary Traudl Junge). I'm not sure if it is a great film or not on a first viewing, as it is a highly emotional experience along with it being intellectual at times. It's a complex film with a specific look, and the documentary-style that borders sometimes on being too much (depending on the viewer).",v
30,31 May 2006,JulianMHall,10, The Truth Is Chilling,"I had the DVD of this film for my birthday, and quite by chance also bought The Name Of The Rose (also produced by Bernd Eichinger) so I had the experience of watching two movies by this superb producer in two days, filmed 20 years apart.",
31,12 March 2006,JamesHitchcock,9," Menschlich, Allzu Menschlich","It has sometimes been said that because men no longer believed in the Devil, God created Adolf Hitler to serve as a symbol of absolute evil. This film, which tells the story of the last few days of World War II in Europe, largely seen from the perspective of Hitler and members of his inner circle as the victorious Russian army approaches the gates of Berlin, avoids that concept and tries to show us Hitler the man rather than Hitler the devil. It has been criticised in some circles for that approach, but in my opinion the criticism is not a valid one. Hitler was precisely that- a man, no less human for also being evil. We will never succeed in understanding the crimes of the Nazis if we persist in trying to see Hitler as the spawn of Satan or as some bizarre, inhuman alien being. He was, in Nietzsche's words, menschlich, allzu menschlich. (Human, all too human).",
32,24 January 2006,Nazi_Fighter_David,9, Shot with nerve-shredding realism...,"Few films have dared to touch WWII objectively from a German point of view; most use the Germans as great villains and Allied forces as great heroes...

33,7 June 2009,classicsoncall,10," ""I must force an outcome in Berlin, or face my downfall"".","I'm having some trouble with other reviewers on this board who feel the movie was an attempt at putting a human face on Adolf Hitler, as providing some sort of apology for the actions of a dictator bent on world domination. Yes, Hitler was a human being, as much as Genghis Khan, Idi Amin, and Osama Bin Laden, but I didn't come away from the film with the impression that he was simply some misguided tragic figure. There are just too many scenes of Hitler in tirades against anyone or anything within his sphere of influence if he wasn't getting his own way. Twenty thousand German soldiers dead attempting to defend Berlin against the Russians - ""But that's what young men are for."" His tirade against the military for the failure of Steiner to launch an assault against the Russians - a completely irrational rant against his high command in the face of certain defeat. The only scene I can recall that one might consider to evoke empathy for Hitler was when Magda Goebbels' children entertained him in the bunker, with the youngest daughter sitting on his lap in a grandfatherly pose. The complete incongruity of that scene with Hitler's true nature struck me as one of those surreal moments in a torrential landscape of surreal moments presented throughout the picture. Like Eva Braun attempting to strike up the dance while the city is being shelled immediately outside. One is forced to consider how these individuals maintained their own sanity as outside forces were about to come crashing down on their heads.",

39,6 March 2009,sddavis63,9, Straightforward But Very Powerful,"There's nothing particularly earth-shattering from a historical perspective here. It's simply the faithfully recounted story of the last 10 days of Adolf Hitler's life in the Bunker beneath the Chancellery. The basic story has been told before in 1981's ""The Bunker"" which starred Anthony Hopkins as Hitler, but although I thought that was well done, this is far superior, primarily because of the frighteningly superb performance of Bruno Ganz as Hitler. He became ""der Fuhrer"" in this movie. He was completely convincing, and offered a more complex portrayal than Hopkins' version. In this movie Hitler shifts between being a charming boss to his secretaries, even sometimes being self-deprecating with them (he says to a nervous Traudl Junge on her first day ""I make a lot of mistakes; you won't make as many as I do"") to being maniacal and out-of control, raging against the betrayals of his colleagues and the failures (in his eyes) of his generals. Brilliant. Alexandra Maria Lara was almost as convincing as Junge. Her character seems to be what ties the movie together (and the movie begins and ends with actual footage of the real Junge being interviewed for the also fascinating documentary ""Im Totem Winkel."") There was also an interesting portrayal of the Goebbels, and especially Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfounch) as she struggles with her conscience at the decision to murder her five children. The setting was realistic; the atmosphere totally believable. I appreciated as well that the movie painted a pretty good picture of what life was like outside the bunker, as we see street-fighting against the Russians, largely involving the Hitler Youth, who were the only ones left to defend the city after the collapse of Germany's armies. The cowardice of Hitler's generals and other officers was clearly shown as well. They obviously know that the war is over and Germany defeated, yet to the end they won't stand up to their demonic leader. This is truly one of the most powerful movies I've seen in a long time. 9/10",

41,30 March 2008,PWNYCNY,10, Great movie.,"This movie probably provides the best dramatic treatment of Adolf Hitler. Unlike other movies that tend to present Hitler as a caricature, this movie opts to portray Hitler as a historical person and not as a clown. Although it is easy to reduce Hitler to a subject for mockery, this movie avoids that temptation and instead presents an Adolf Hitler the person whose actions are made even more sinister, baffling and amazing by the sheer banality of his existence. In this movie Hitler is shown not as a hysteric, not as the bombastic political actor, leader and rabble rouser familiar in all too many documentaries, but as a frail, broken, disillusioned man whose dreams have been shattered and whose closest advisers have all but abandoned him. Yet, even as Hitler himself realizes that his demise is all but inevitable, the movie shows how the cohort of secretaries, clerks and party flunkies who formed Hitler's personal staff refused to leave him and opted to stay with the Fuhrer to the bitter end. This level of devotion to a failed and doomed head of state is perhaps unprecedented in history. While the Third Reich was crumbling they stayed with the man who was responsible for the destruction of their country. Yet the same man who was capable of ordering the conquest of entire countries and the extermination of entire peoples was also capable of individual acts of kindness that makes his career all the more baffling to the audience. Can the personality and career of Adolf Hitler ever be fully explained? Maybe not, but this excellent movie at least provides a plausible glimpse of what Hitler may have been about and how his dreams of new world order came crashing down.",

Here we have an excellent performance from Bruno Ganz as Adolph Hitler, who shows the man's insanity, inhumanity, and his cunning way with people in his intimate circle that allowed him to seduce those around him and the German population at large. Even as everything was falling apart he still had both men and women falling at his knees begging for his next proclamation and willing to follow any order her decreed. In the end, the crushing defeat of his grand ideals, coupled with his irrational hatred for Jewish people that is actually a projection of his own inner hatred for himself and Germany (""The Germans seal their own fate. I have no sympathy for the so-called civilians,"" he says towards the end of days), lead him into paranoid despair and eventual suicide. Likewise, we get a searing performance from Julian Kohler (a fantastic actress best known for her lead in ""Nowhere in Africa"") as Eva Braun, representing perfectly the German elite seduced by the promises of a Utopian Third Reich, and who are in utter and complete denial of the horrors around them right up to the last minute as everything they fought for comes spiraling down into their own self-made hell.",

Story is about the last few days of the Third Reich where we see Berlin crumbling from the Russian forces and Adolph Hitler (Bruno Ganz) and those around him having to go underground in a bunker.

As the film is set in and around the Führerbunker, director Oliver Hirschbiegel used eyewitness accounts, survivors' memoirs, and other historical sources during production to reconstruct the look and atmosphere of 1940s Berlin. The screenplay was based on the books Inside Hitler's Bunker by historian Joachim Fest and Until the Final Hour by Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries, among other accounts of the period. Bernd Eichinger who wrote the screenplay and produced the film, to explain his work in one word, extraordinary. According to Eichinger, the film's overlying idea was to make a film about Hitler and wartime Germany that was very close to historical truth, as part of a theme that would allow the German nation to save their own history and ""experience their own trauma"". To accomplish this, the film explores Hitler's decisions and motives during his final days through the perspective of the individuals who lived in the Führerbunker during those times.",

It's true, whenever a film such as this comes out portraying the Third Reich not as an Indiana Jones-type Empire of Evil, we Germans turn around in advance protesting: ""This is not meant to justify anything! Of course Hitler was a monster!"" I don't think anyone seriously judges young Germans today by what their great-grandparents did, but it's of course something never to be forgotten. Sadly, it's also a convenient stereotype in politics and movie-making that tends show demons instead of humans, with the effect that we no longer understand just how on earth such things were possible. Hopefully it will take a very long time before the Nazis are surpassed in evil. But closing our eyes to the real Hitler, Stalin or Mao and their minions in favor of a legend will prevent us from ever understanding how these things work.

This parable of life without hope has been interpreted by many as an allusion to the concentration camps, but it also serves ably as a stylistic description of Berlin in the last days of the war, as depicted in Oliver Hirschbiegel's superb film 'Downfall'. At the centre of the film is a brilliant performance from Bruno Ganz as Hitler, someone who had stripped himself of decency and who here is robbed by defeat first of his charisma, and then of his power, leaving only a vapour of malice and madness clinging to the shell of a man. There are also some interesting portraits of other members of the Nazi inner circle: Speer, dignified but unashamed; Himmler, rational and charmless; and the inhumanly zealous family Goebbels. We also see the life of Hitler's secretaries, who had chosen not to see the truth until it was too late but to do otherwise; one of them (in real life) gives an interview that tops and tails the film. Perhaps the most sympathetic portrayal is that of Eva Braun; her sang-froid, and love of Hitler, are utterly mad but retain some connection with what might be considered admirable qualities in another context.",

89,28 June 2006,alex_t4444,9, Shockingly Realistic and Moving,"Downfall launches the viewer head-on into the last moments of the Reich in Berlin, 1945. It doesn't patronise the viewer with an explanatory voice over it is unflinchingly real. Ganz's performance as Hitler is terrific he manages to capture the sense of terror and awe that the real-life counter part had. The supporting cast are also superb portraying the sense of utter loss and crushed belief as the seemingly invincible idea of Germania collapses around them. This film has been criticised for humanising the Nazis, particularly Hitler but I find this to be it's strongest point. Unlike most war films the Germans are shown as human, they have emotions, they weep as their children die and their leader weeps as his monstrous scheme dies. The film really portrays the manner in which the German people were swept up with National Socialism, they lived and died for it. It also captures the terrifying will to power which the Nazis used so inhumanely over the 'weak' which even turn out to be the German civilians after a while. All in all a moving and shockingly realistic portrayal of a legacy which still haunts us to this day.",

91,26 November 2022,xiaoli7377,10, Hitler was Human; That Makes It All the More Terrifying,"""Downfall"" is a very great psychological study into NOT portraying Adolf Hitler (Bruno Ganz) as some overly caricaturized comic book supervillain or something akin to Darth Vader, but actually showing the clear megalomaniacal and manipulative sociopathic tendencies. Ganz is excellent here, you really feel like you're actually watching Hitler crumble away psychologically as he denies the reality that his regime is coming to an end, slowly losing his grip on reality and lashing out at those who are clearly putting their survival above the craziness. It's great in that it doesn't show him in such a light as to make him sympathetic, but to show what true evil looks like. Not somebody who is brutal 100% of the time, but one who has some major underlying problems and has the wherewithal to put on a friendly face and ""kiss the babies"" when the time comes. A very scary portrait of a figure and also a very poignant and apt for this current political climate in the world today.",
92,12 October 2006,pagblonk,9, der Untergang - the donwfall of Hitler and his third Reich,"If anything was horrifying, it must have been the years in which Hitler reigned over Germany, especially during World War II. Nothing has been more commented on, almost everybody knows what happened during his reign. So when people decided that movies ought to be made to show us the hows, whens and whats, these were made. Unfortunately, Nazi-Germans spoke English, as they were played by Americans and Englishmen. It was very easy to qualify the German people as 'evil'. Now, after 60 years, we see the story from the inside. Little by little we understand that the German people suffered as much as anybody suffered from the terror used by the Nazi-regime. Bruno Ganz may well have played the role of his life, I have never seen an actor playing Hitler so realistically, showing him being normal, frightening, aggressive and mad. This movie, showing the WWII from a non-allied point of view, is a must for all those who easily speak of Germans, when they mean Nazis.",
93,7 February 2006,maveric_74,9," Outstanding, amazing, spellbinding","History tells us that Hitler was a great orator, a charismatic leader who held millions spellbound. Downfall follows that same role model as it paints a gripping, harrowing last few days of Adolf Hitler in his bunker in Berlin as the Russians close in..Still in charge, but barely there in mind or body, it almost seems that as the country collapsed around him, Hitler himself disintegrated. The movie is amazingly real, thanks to an amazing performance by Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler. The set detail, the storyline and all the supporting cast of characters is just about perfect. I could not fault this movie at all. You feel as if you are witnessing history unfold before your very eyes. To the end, despite his state of health, Hitler believed in his ""ethnic cleansing"" policy, appeared delusional in his belief that somehow he could lead Germany to victory over the allies.",
94,6 May 2005,writers_reign,6, Bunker Hell,"I put off seeing this film until it was the only game in town and although I've been known to nod off even in 90 minute fare I remained awake for all two and a half hours of this. Its strength is to remain detached from the actual combat it is recording so that we never actually SEE the Allies in action but only the effects of the shelling, bombing, etc. A good ninety per cent of the footage is devoted to the bunker in which Hitler holed up for the last days of the war and whether by design or accident the feeling is of rats scuttling through a maze in search of the cheese that is never going to be there ever again. The acting is of a uniformly high standard virtually all of it in the hands of actors completely unknown outside Germany - or at least in England - and if one must single out Bruno Ganz it is only because he has been saddled with trying to find something in Hitler that would indicate that once he WAS a human being. Although the bunker is well lit and the occupants DO from time to time venture to the surface for a breath of fresh? air the lighting favours darker, solemn, even depressing hues and the symbolism at the end which depicts a day of glorious sunlight could be said to be a tad over the top but otherwise it's a fine film that depicts characters from the full spectrum of our preconceived image of the 'Nazi' from the chilling Magda Goebbles calmly killing her own children in the finest tradition of Greek tragedy to Hitler himself contemptuous of the German civilians who have and must continue to suffer on the altar of his madness to the more rational even verging on the humane of some of his staff. It's difficult to say who is the typical audience for this film but other comments and responses show it is wider than we might imagine.",
95,3 June 2005,maxhert,10," The madness, the propaganda, the glamour","I just saw this film yesterday, after listening to violent reactions on the radio. Here in Argentina there's a big Jewish community and it had a big impact. One of the presenters of a radio program was very offended by the fact that there were a lot of deaths depicted in the film but the actual moment when Hitler shoots himself wasn't. The man wanted to see it, needed it for his own satisfaction! That's disturbing, knowing there's so much hate going around, and in persons too young to ever have had direct contact with the facts in question. That implies that someone older took a lot of work in implanting that hate. That's frightening. On the film, I think the great thing about this film is you can see a person or persons who have undergone a process of dehumanization and indoctrination that at the time point of the movie is completely irreversible, and they acknowledge they have no future in a project different than theirs. Hitler makes clear at several points that he chose to construct himself as such a person, and in the end he is nearly delusional, unable to separate the fatherland from his own personna, but remaining a human being when he's not concerned with matters of state. That makes his craziness much more believable, almost schizophrenic. On the whole, you see masses brainwashed by propaganda, some of them wanting blindly to be brainwashed, some accepting it warmly because of a sense of security. That is the story of Junge, as most of the others. I think that's the fatherland concept, you know you can relax and enjoy your country because there's a hard guy in the government that cares for you, and if you support him without asking too much, things will be great for you and the likes of you. I think it's good to see that in a global context. The moral for me is that when in a tragic national situation people look for comfort, they'd rather accept propaganda that makes them feel secure and positive rather than question from their own points of view. So blocks of power are formed on stereotypes and propaganda, and measures taken in the end that no ordinary person would avail in a day to day basis, but the death of individual unbiased thinking ends up like that.",

The film is well done as a stand alone dramatic presentation. However, it excels as an historical drama by providing insights into Hitler's last days; something never dealt with in such detail before in film.

The day we celebrate an united Europe (that same Europe that Robert Schumman kicked-off in the 50s and still works in preventing further wars). To make it clear: I am not German. Yet, for more than a few reasons, the history of the Second World War always touched me in a particular way. Not that it was any different from so many other wars. Except for the numbers. Never did human cruelty climbed to such levels. Never did we realize as then, how easy can society mutate into a monster. This was a highly intense movie to watch. Bruno Ganz will for ever be remembered as the magisterial actor that played Hitler - as Ben Kingsley is remembered for Gandhi. We see him in this film as a madman. There is no other way to describe it. He was insane. An insane man led the world to collapse, brought Humanity to its knees, and did so unquestioned. Der Untergang is full of strong imagery - it shouldn't matter if those in the streets were German or not. The human misery is total. I could not contain my tears in many occasions (not titanic tears, rather those that come from the depth, those that imply something beyond the screen. tears of History). In others, I simply had to close or cover my eyes, so brutal were the scenes. And as we come to an end, I am, as viewer, left with a sense of emptiness.

I mark this movie highly despite the subject matter not because of it. I believe (personally) the acting to be second to none and rather than feeling sorry for the antagonists, watching them squirm like rats in a tunnel crawling over each other, I take a perverse pleasure in their frantic, brow mopping final machinations to delay the inevitable.

A disturbing and unsettling film in that the intimate portrayal of Hitler as a fallible human being invites us to empathise with him, despite all that we know about his political fanaticism and monstrous actions.

It's as interesting as devastating to watch this old woman discuss her perception of existence or lack of guilt when it comes to her role in the Third Reich. It immediately gets you into the subject and mood and they really couldn't have started the film more convincingly. Next would be the surreal dance sequence instigated by Eva Braun and Köhler's ""I WANT TO DANCE"" is as bizarre as it gets in that situation with bombs hitting everywhere nearby. The comment of Lara's character and her collapse afterward summarize the ambiance perfectly and game me massive chills. Next would be Corinna Harfouch playing Magda Goebbels, the ""mother of the nation"" and her scenes with her children towards the end. Heartbreaking and so well-acted. And then, there is of course Bruno Ganz. I'm not sure if it's his very best performance, but it's certainly his most famous and it's good to see him getting the recognition for a lifetime of great acting. He has many good scenes here and delivers one of the most intriguing portrayals of a significant historic character. Of course, there's his angry speech to Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf about the attack from Steiner which was an order and should have taken place in any case, the one you may have seen spoofed with English fake subtitles quite a few times.",

There need be no more after you see ""The Downfall"" grimly presenting the Fuhrer's last days of his life in 1945 in his bunker. Bruno Ganz is the definitive Hitler: morose, fitful, tender, murderous, and demented. Ganz not only looks like Hitler, but he also inhabits his character with passion and possibly an understanding of his premiere place in the halls of historical hooligans. (The chance that Ganz does too close an interpretation is possible for the purists.) Ganz is able at the same time to flesh out some charm and warmth without a measure of sympathy for a certifiable despot. The scene where her hires his secretary (the only one not in the bunker area), Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara), has a tenderness uncharacteristic of the public tyrant.

In the scenes where we escape the underground hell  an effective depiction of the Hitler Youth fighting on the streets as the Russians close in; the operation of the SS killing squads; some surreal cigarette breaks in the Chancellory grounds; the heroic actions of an SS hospital doctor working under blanket bombing; and a fanciful coda as a secretary makes her escape through Russian lines by averting her face  do we perceive the director's careful, but not objectionable, awareness of modern German sensibilities.

129,5 October 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, A train wreck in slow motion.,"'Downfall (2004)' focuses on the final days of WWII as seen through the eyes of those closest to Adolf Hitler, who seems to lose what little sanity he has as he hides away among thick walls of his underground bunker. There isn't really a protagonist, per se. Instead, the piece moves between a few key characters to craft a relatively all-encompassing account of its events. It's not like you 'root' for any of the characters; most of them are Nazis, after all. Instead, you watch the eponymous downfall with a morbid curiosity. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion: the destruction is inevitable but the process is oddly compelling. The only people you really feel sorry for are the civilians. Innocent people are needlessly killed, caught in the cross-fire during the siege of Berlin, and even the German army is wasted on suicide missions that no-one in their right mind would go through with. That's just the thing, though; Hitler isn't in his right mind. His stubborn unwillingness to surrender belies his delusional state, while his open contempt for his own people belies the fact that he never really cared about his country. Bruno Ganz's portrayal is incredibly effective, displaying a dynamic range and an unwillingness to allow his despicable character to become a cartoonish monster. The movie doesn't take the easy route of portraying Hitler as some sort of bogeyman. Instead, it goes out of its way to portray him as human, forcing you to consolidate the fact that you and he somehow belong to the same species. It's this that the affair is most remembered for. However, its derailment continues well after Hitler's death. Once their leader abandons them, the Nazis that remain must decide how - and, indeed, if - to proceed. Here, the piece hammers home just how indoctrinated many members truly were, refusing to move past their final orders or imagine a life for their families in a world without Nazism. Frankly, it boggles the mind. There are a few who come to understand the atrocities that were happening around them, things that they were blind to before. Does ignorance beget forgiveness? The movie's real-life interview with Traudl Junge, Hitler's final secretary and the author of one of two books the feature is based on, seeks to go some way in answering this. It's just one of the thematic queries that the affair deals with. Indeed, there are lessons to be learned here. Though most of those ought to have soaked into the worldwide consciousness already, the flick's 'insider' perspective does a good job of emphasising them. It delves into a difficult and often undocumented aspect of one of the worst periods in memory. It's as informative as any history lesson, yet it's done in an atmospheric and mostly compelling way. Because it lacks traditional characters and isn't really concerned with empathy in the way movies usually are, it can sometimes be a little less compelling than you'd expect. It's interesting, yet a little dry. Having said that, it occasionally springs to life and grips in a deeper way. It isn't enjoyable but it is engaging. It's definitely worth watching. 7/10",

Researched down to the smallest detail, this is an unflinching look at the last few days of Hitler - and the Third Reich - in the Bunker in Berlin. It is gritty & realistic - there are NO Hollywood niceties here, just a slowly creeping sense of doom and almost disbelief at the irrational and incoherent rantings of a doomed Nazi 'cult'. For that is what 'Nazism' in it's purest form is - more a Religion than a Political movement. What makes this entire experience even more stunning is that it is based on real eyewitness accounts by the people who were there - and survived. Principally through the experience of Traudl Junge, Hitler's Secretary, who witnessed virtually everything in those final few days, we get to experience the 'death' of the Reich as it really was - chaotic, murderous, bloody and INSANE. Bruno Ganz delivers a stunning performance as Hitler - seemingly rational on occasions - tempered by violent outbursts of rage when he feels his orders have not been followed. The German cast are excellent across the board - Kohler's Eva Braun is vivacious and daring, and Harfouch's Magda Goebbels is the epitome of Nazi motherhood - not even wanting her children to survive if Nazism doesn't. Matthes' as Goebbels is almost the devil's spin-doctor and horrifically believable - still crafting empty, useless, speeches as the Soviet guns thunder overhead. His totally uncaring response to SS BF Mohnke's observation that the 'Volkssturm' Units - old men and boys - are being slaughtered is the very essence of Nazi ideology - they NEED to die for the Fuhrer. Time and time again this nihilistic ideology comes through - Hitler dismissing the German people as not worthy of HIM and therefore expendable, Goebbels exclaiming that the Germans gave the Nazis a mandate for what they did (not mentioning of course that they took away any democratic opportunity to get rid of them!) The scenes where Nazi Police hunt the streets for 'deserters' or 'Cowards' - hanging German civilians for the slightest infraction - even while Soviet troops and tanks are yards away - shows the utter insanity of the Nazi position.",

The film shows us the slaughter and murders above the ground, the terrible blasts of the Soviet artillery fire on the governmental district of the capital Berlin. Under the ground life is peaceful and almost normal. The strength of the movie is that it shows us very acceptable, human and normal people around the broken Hitler. The most macabre scenes involve Magda Goebels murdering her beautiful children after she gives them a drink to sleep.

Yet, German director Oliver Hirschbiegel decided to go deep into the last ten days of Hitler's life, exploring his crazy military strategies and the people surrounding him, some supporting him others waiting for him to finally take his life so they can escape. This movie was fantastic. I have no complainants what so ever about this movie. Everything was perfectly done, the acting was out standing and the historical accuracy was out of this world amazing.

The film showed a lot of futile deaths: ten year old recruits falling in the streets of Berlin fighting against the Russians, deserters shot by Gestapo patrols. It also showed Hitler's power over the people who still obeyed him and many of them also followed his example and committed suicide in the last days. Perhaps the most shocking was Frau Gobbels, who murdered her six children, saying that it was not worth living in a world without Nazism.

If you like that book you'll like the movie plus you'll be historically prepared for the events depicted in the movie. The performances are dead on, especially the minor characters of the fanatic Nazis. If you spend much time looking at blogs and message boards in today's political climate, it's easy to believe people can be this crazy. Magda Goebbels made me think of Ann Coulter. The vignettes of Nazi Germany's death throes interspersed with the battle in Berlin's ruins are one of the truest pictures of the horror (and heroism) of war since ""Saving Private Ryan."" Some viewers may find some scenes too horrifying, as Frau Goebbels did murder her own children, and there are numerous executions and murder-suicides shown as well. This movie is good history, centered mostly around the experience of a nice-looking, but not very sharp girl who was Hitler's secretary for the latter half of the war. She wasn't corrupted by the experience, which is one of the most interesting aspects. I wonder what the affect of a wide US release of this movie would have been last year.",

We watch Eva Brown (Juliane Kohler), who amidst the turmoil and destruction, her main preoccupation is to die looking beautiful, so she chooses the poison instead of the bullet. We watch Frau Goebells (Corinna Harfouch) who prefers to have her children killed than live in a world of ""decadants"".

Bruno Ganz is stunning as Adolf Hitler, Alexandra Maria Lara seemingly a little too bewildered too much of the time (though it may have been a very accurate portrayal) as his secretary, and Corinna Harfouch and Ulrich Matthes both decidedly scary as the fanatic heads of the Goebbels family.

Its a historical document in film, insofar as its absolutely faithful to facts and history. Hitler was a man with a magnetic charisma and personality, who manipulated people and created in Germany a powerful cult of the leader, through which he became almost unassailable, doing everything he wanted without anyone having the possibility of oppose. We can imagine this manipulative power seeing his generals shaking as ill-behaved boys in one of its most famous scenes. We watch everything: the dictator commanding imaginary troops, inventing plans and dream cities, but also directing, in a ruthlessly and cunning way, the few that were faithful to him until the end. The gap between the reality in and off the bunker and the general insensitivity to the suffering of the country is brutally glaring. The actors are illustrious strangers, to the extent that I have never heard of any of them, but the work developed is enough for the film to work very well. In fact, the film is not an acting show, although its good. The value of the film is in the script and story told, no matter how well known it is.

Its direction is almost perfect in all its aspects: sceneries, camera movements, screen-play, acting, technical features, etc.. The character of Hitler is so well performed by Bruno Ganz that we forget that we are before an actor and come to think we are before Hitler himself. The movie shows with striking realism all the contrast between the almost normal and quiet bunker scenes and the awful war ones taking place outside with all their fights and the drama lived by the civil population. Inside the bunker we watch the progressive psychological and physical decay of the dictator still surrounded for his few fanatic supporters still ready to die for him and his ideology when outside in the city all crumbles under Soviet fire. The mad man still believes the war can be won and in the map he moves military units and divisions that don't exist anymore. Since monsters can sometimes also be human beings we can watch sometimes a few human and even generous attitudes of Hitler and his followers. Some people have criticized this as attempts to show Hitler and the Nazis under a more favourable light. I don't agree with this. Realism is realism and must not be Manichean. If we want to know a human being (though a monster) in all his entirety we must know all of his or her features. The movie is realistic in all its aspects and with extreme rigour. All the characters act just like we expect them to do and incarnate extremely well the real people they are supposed to do.

Somehow he managed to add a grand depth to Hitler, especially in his passive moments of deep thought - completely humanizing his 'character'. Entwined with the scenes of Hitler are war scenes, yet unglorified sections of one nearby area being attacked. So gritty yet stark makes for exhilarating viewing; outstanding cinematography and sound. It had perfect pacing, matching the subtext of events to make it more affecting, which was extremely effective despite not always being so subtle.

186,10 June 2011,varunthedragon-931-766034,9, Haunting,"""Der Untergang"" or ""Downfall"" is certainly not your everyday Nazi movie. the movie begins with the introduction of Traudl Junge, who is chosen from a handful of ladies to be the Fuhrer Adolf Hitler's private secretary. Two years later, the Red Army has fought its way to the outskirts of Berlin and, despite the advice of his followers, Hitler decides to stay in the Fuhrerbunker and supervise Berlin's ""defense"". The movie then follows, through the eyes of Traudl, the last days of one of the most hated men in history. A classic question we ask ourselves whenever we hear or see news of someone doing a despicable deed (terrorists, for example), is ""Are they even human?"" We are often too afraid to know that the answer is ""YES"". To commit such atrocities, you can only be human. This is shown in this movie by its depiction of the Nazi High Command. We see them not as a set of demons ruled by the biggest demon of all but as normal men driven by fate to commit the atrocities. That still does not mean this shows them as ""sympathetic and misunderstood"". If you see this movie, had you hated Hitler for the well documented ""Final Solution"", you might hate him even more for his cowardice and the fact that he let his own people suffer the collapse of his dreams to the bitter end. Bruno Ganz's performance is not praised for nothing. It shows the world's most famous tyrant as a clearly deluded man living on fundamentally incorrect assumptions about human nature, slowly losing track of reality who nevertheless had a larger than life presence about him that people of like mind and impressionable youths took to. We see this dogged loyalty from his followers the most fanatical of whom are almost as deluded as the man himself. Hitler's personal life is also interesting to note. It goes a long way to show that you need not be a socially inept person or show tendencies of animal cruelty to walk the path of a tyrant. By the end of this movie, you might ""pity"" Hitler as one would pity a rabid dog that needs to be put down. Yet you see a differing of opinions even among his inner circle. There are the doggedly loyal ones like Goebbels and his wife but there were others who saw through his delusions and aimed for damage control albeit too late. Overall, this is a must watch for fans of Holocaust movies and, although fairly slow, is one of the most engaging movies I've seen. My rating-9/10",

189,29 September 2008,TheEmulator23,10, Brilliant in it's entirety. Amazing film.,"I'm a huge history buff especially WWII & the German History of the Nazi's rise to power. I've read & studied about Hitler, Goebbels, Goering & especially Albert Speer, who was the only one to say he was ""sorry"" @ the Nuremberg trials. His books that he wrote ""Inside the Third Reich & The Spandau Diaries"" are fantastic questionably true portrayals about his life who was the closest thing to that Hitler had as a friend. This film for whatever reason didn't win the Oscar for best Foreign Language Film, but it should have. I have seen this probably a dozen or so times & know the History extremely well & yet this film still has tremendous power every time I see it. The actors are Superb especially Bruno Ganz in a eerily similar manner & look of Hitler. His performance is brilliant & he captures the manic that was within that truly was shown towards the inevitable end. Even if you aren't a fan of History (which is a shame, ""those that don't learn from history, are doomed to repeat it"", great quote can't remember who said it) this is still a great film in of it self. It doesn't matter if you know the story or not because you will be fully engrossed once you start watching this superbly done film. I wouldn't have been able to appreciate this as much when I was younger *cough* teenager, like I can now, but if you miss out on this film It will be a shame. The fact that most of this film %%80-%90 percent of it is probably true too. This was extensively researched by those involved & the commentary by the director is extremely informative and interesting as well. By far one of the best commentaries I ever heard. He rarely stops talking (in a good way) & always has something interesting to say about the making of the film, the characters, & the basic true stories of those he profiles. A great film in every way which everyone should see. I'm a pretty tough critic so feel free to check my other comments to see where I stand. I don't give 10's very often maybe 1/500 films I see is a 10, so that is saying something, but don't take it from me, figure it out for yourself.",

194,26 April 2005,ThrownMuse,8, Captivating with stunning performances and a powerful underlying message,"This is a dramatized account of Hitler's final days in his bunker at the end of World War II. The story is told partly through the eyes of his most fervent supporters as well as his last secretary, Traudl Junge. Downfall is a cinematic triumph that has the potential to be completely misunderstood, but it seems most critics and viewers are grasping it. The filmmakers assume the audience is familiar with the history of the Holocaust, and focuses solely on Hitler and his interactions with his loyal supporters and family at the end of his reign. The story is a bit uneven and has trouble deciding whether it's Hitler's narrative or Jungle's narrative. But ultimately, it is a character study of Hitler in his final days--a man who wanted to retain his power so badly that he wanted to sacrifice the German civilians that he claimed to be saving. It is also a portrait of a group of people who are so unquestionably zealous in their beliefs and how they react to the destruction of their power. The performances are haunting and emotional, especially by Bruno Ganz (Hitler), Alexandra Maria Lara (Traudl Junge), and Juliane Kohler (Eva Braun). Some might think this is an insensitive film or ""sympathetic"" to Hitler, but this is not how I saw it. This is an important film and exactly what the world needs right now. Hitler wasn't a monster that should be seen as an anomaly in the human race. He was a human being capable of monstrosities. There are plenty of people today with political power that are committing monstrosities and they shouldn't be followed blindly.",

196,5 November 2005,richardv-johnson,10," Devastating, necessary, and very brave","A highlight of the Russian art exhibit at the Guggenheim is a propaganda picture of Stalin and other Soviet leaders (some, like Bukharin, about to be purged) smiling and greeting an exemplary worker. It's very large and somehow comic and shocking at the same time. It's very hard to imagine a picture of Hitler and the Nazi elite ever being displayed like that, even 100 years from now. Possibly Stalin and Mao were responsible for more deaths than Hitler, certainly of their own people, and they were no less insane, especially in their final years. Maybe because they died still in power, they've never been dramatized as Hitler has been so many times. The Alec Guiness Last 10 Days of Hitler covered much the same ground as Der Untergang, but Bruno Ganz has outdone any previous portrayals. This film is relentless in making the audience experience life in the bunker and also in the streets of Berlin above. Josef and Magda Goebbels have never been so real and frightening. Eva Braun has never seemed so frantic and pathetic. It took great courage for German filmmakers to approach this subject so honestly. Ironically, while war-torn Warsaw in The Pianist was recreated on a Berlin sound-stage, it appears from the final credits that the Berlin of Der Untergang was shot in St. Petersburg. This is a great antidote to the Russian film Moloch, made at Berchtesgaden, which made the Nazis clowns instead of monsters. Stupid and banal they were, but not funny. Charles Chaplin said that if he had known about the death camps he would have never made The Great Dictator. There is no comic relief, nor any tragic dignity either, in this harrowing and graphic account of the end of an evil tyranny.",

This film for a rare moment treats its audience with the intelligence we deserve - yes we know Hitler was a nutter and there's plenty of evidence to display what occurred during those crazy years in Germany. We don't need a lifetime of fiction and non-fiction slating him as a Demon. This realistic account will remain a definitive account of this war cabinet's last moments - if only more filmmakers were able to do this factual justice to important events of human history. I wonder when someone will make a film based on the work of Anthony Sutton who's research in the sixties documents demonstrable evidence of Wall Street and the Banks of England funding the development of the military infrastructure of Germany in the thirties and forties.",

It shows how defeat had to be accepted by the die hard Nazis's and the sheer terror of what was happening to them. I thought it was acted superbly throughout.

Hitler is seen as an evil in the sense that he did order the Holocaust (but its only mentioned in passing) and ordered the destruction of Germany which Albert Speer refused to obey. But Downfall also shows that Hitler did love Eva Braun, his dog and he was good with children. The film also showed that Hitler was loosing the plot, being in ideas of grandeur and that German was going to win the war despite the Russians overrunning Berlin.

207,1 May 2020,krational66,9, Choice and cost,"'we never forced the people,' Mr. Goebbels said. 'they chose us.' Now is the time for them to die for their choices.
This, in my view, is at the heart of the German tragedy. It's just that the target of the culprit is so recognizable that people can easily shift the blame to them, making them more visible and visible. But good deeds may be done incognito, the rights of the people may be exercised by their representatives, but evil cannot be hidden or accounted for by their representatives. Hitler, as a human being, must have a human side; Since people are human beings, they must also have a bestiality. So Hitler could be the ""uncle"" of the little goebbels, and every bit of nazism in Germany could be combined to launch a powerful anti-semitic machine.
It's not a matter of ""cheating"" to cover up. 'but they're people,' says Grace to her father in dogtown. 'people have weaknesses.' The iron-faced father replied, so they have to pay for what they did. Von trier's technique is not only to save money, when all obstacles do not exist, when all the behavior of people are naked in front of each other, can not avoid, human nature no longer hide. When Grace was first raped, the residents of dog town went about their business as usual. The evil of transparency makes all calm absurd and disguised. What if those invisible walls really do not exist? What if the crime was exposed in broad daylight? Would things be different? Or do they really or pretend they don't? When it became an open secret that every man would go to Grace's room for the night, where did their eyes look? God is merciful, he let us learn to block. How many human weaknesses, cowardice, selfishness, cruelty are prevented by the four walls, avoid the test, the blame and the loss, so that we can continue to dress up to play their role, to god as an innocent good man.
But are we? Are we really good people? Are we worthy of our own moral and conscience?
'no one forced me to do this,' Traudl Junge says in the opening credits. 'it was my choice to go to Berlin.' At the end of the film, she added: I finally know, young, is not an excuse.
'I don't blame them,' Grace told her father. 'they've done their best in their environment.' 'if I lived in this environment, I couldn't do it any better,' she added.
If that is all, the hope that remains in Pandora's box really does not deserve to be possessed by humans.
Mankind deserves, perhaps, only the towering flood of god.
In von trier's box, too, was a spirit of hope. The bright moon like god's searchlight, let Grace clear out the reality of the dog town. She said to her father, they did their best, but it wasn't good enough, it wasn't good enough.
So the child was killed in front of the mother, the house was burned, the sky was red.
Hope had never been an angel, and the deal with morpheus was the only way out.
Someone is bound to accuse the director of suppressing violence with violence. But Grace has tried. The purity of the virgin can indeed infect and change people. However, they have their limits. They always come to a screeching halt before the dividing line.
Von trier just did what god wanted him to do. If god had the atom bomb, there might be no need for a flood",

We are able to see how are the last days of Berlin, the battle that is going to destroy the city and how different characters deal with this moment: some disobey Hitler and run for their lives, others commit suicide due to Hitler orders... The film is 2h 30m long, but you are so immersed in the story that probably you will not be able to realize that. The actors task is superb, specially Bruno Ganz (Hitler) and Ulrich (Goebbels) who play the most spectacular acting of Nazis leaders I've never seen. Touching and hearth-taking, this is one of the most hard war films ever done, as we are able to see how the city is destroyed and a country disappears (usually war films are about victories, not defeats). Unluckily, there are so many characters and so many aspects that the director wants to show that sometimes the spectator can find himself a little lost about what is happening to who. I realize that this is a hard task for the director and it does it quite well but this fact can result a little disappointing.

It's story transcends the language barrier and gives a new depth to the infamous Adolf Hitler. The story is told from his side, for a change, and gradually unveils the incredibly poignant story of his downfall. Everybody knows of the things he's done, so his crimes are hardly mentioned and never dwelled upon. Instead we see Hitler's mental deterioration as the war front grows closer and closer to his bunker. He must face something he's never had to face before: defeat. Bruno Ganz gives one of my favorite male performances of all time as Hitler. Not only does he physically resemble the notorious leader, but he also possesses the same assertiveness and odd mix of anger and fear which brings the character to life. The film is also sandwiched between actual footage from an interview with Traudl Junge (Hitler's personal secretary) which gives the film a firm foundation in reality and an unparalleled emotional core. This film is a masterpiece in every sense.",

As the fate of the German people becomes bleaker and bleaker, as Berlin is invaded by the Russians, the men who cower in their Bunker to lead them into doom refuse to cease the madness of Hitler, instead allowing him to fill the country with false hope while pointing an accusing finger at his Generals and laying the blame of defeat at the German people who so mistakenly followed him into power and mistakenly believed in a cruel false prophet.",
212,1 April 2005,Chris_Docker,8, Possibly one of the most remarkable documentary dramas ever made,"Downfall is an achievement on a tremendous scale, and all the better for being a German film since it chronicles the final days of a Hitler, who not only devastated half the known world and a very large number of Jews, but also most of his own country and the people who had put their trust in him long before he ascended to a position where he could abuse it on such a massive scale. It is a fascinating story because although we feel we 'know' it, it has never really been told on film, and never so forcefully or by his own countrymen (who of course play Germans, good and bad, much better than American imitations in Hollywood!) The film also comes at a watershed where Germans are coming to accept their history, as is the rest of the world, without feeling they have to apologise for Hitler at every breath. German people of that time, it might be argued, were also (at least very many of them) victims of a madman who were forced to endure the destruction wrought by the Allied bombing. That is true of almost any horrific dictator, but the film is careful not to over-humanise him. We see those (some, not all) of those near to him secretly horrified at his views - both regarding the destruction of Jews and the destruction of his own people. But the credits also point out that, even among the populace, ignorance was no excuse. Downfall is no revisionist whitewash - it is perhaps as honest an attempt as any could be to portray the last days of a madman, still clinging ferociously to power. Everyone whose life or loved ones was badly affected by Hitler has the right to feel aggrieved, but it is not, for instance, limited to Jews or even non-Germans.",

It did precisely that: it humanized a monster because he was really human and it showed him for the ugly, little cruel man he was. That he was kind to his help and his dog weighs light in his balance against his mass murder and all out war. Bruno Ganz blew away all those pompous Brits who normally star in those Hitler-in-the-Berlin-bunker sort of movie. He was awesome, almost real. The scenes above ground in bomb/shell/bullet ravaged Berlin are like Dutch master portraits of hell. Here, we see Berlin in her death agony at the end of the greatest war. Now it's the Zero Hour, Stunde Null, in Berlin in all the horror and absurdity. Ironically, they used the ultimate WW ll victim city as for location, St. Petersburg or Leningrad. It captures the feeling of one of the most horrific battles in modern history, in small, block by block scenes of small scale horror.

But Hitler was a person as much as I hate to admit it. As a society we cannot always see things one way, we must make revisions and reexaminations of the past and Downfall does that. For 60 years 99% of all World War II movies have been shown from point of view, the Allies. And they always portray Hitler as one type of person without explanation. This movie gave it's best shot and it did it. Hitler needs to be shown for what he really was and how he really acted, and he is in this movie. He isn't the same dictator that is shown in all the other war movies as the bumbling, psychotic, egotistical maniac. This film he is still mentally unbalanced and egotistical, and a maniac when he states that it is best for the German people to be thrown back into the middle ages since they have failed in his plan to win the war. And when he invents divisions to defend Berlin from the Soviets. No movie has done that before and this for changing the way Hitler is looked upon is in my minds eye a masterpiece.",

Certainly the best and most dramatic depiction of the fall of Berlin that I've seen. But as a ""movie,"" I found it lacking. There is no central POV; we're introduced to many characters, some of whom we recognize by sight (Goering and Goebbles have become caricatures over time)while others are unknown and their roles are never really explained. A friend is currently reading a book called HITLER'S INNER CIRCLE. Perhaps if I'd read that before seeing the film I may have had a better understanding of who all the personalities were. Rather than focusing solely on the bunker goings-on this film takes us to the streets of greater Berlin where we see generals making futile last stands and encounter roving bands of vigilantes executing anyone trying to flee the chaos and destruction. While these scenes are interesting, they take us away from the central story, which is Hitler and his main underlings' last stand. I felt drained at the end of this film. Nobody to cheer for, nobody to feel sympathy for.

It is mind-blowing, brilliantly fantastic! The way he adopts Hitler's accent, the way he talked in general, the way he angrily reacts to every news of doom, is all out of the world. I in particular liked his acting in the scene where he discovers about Himmler's ""treason"". Pure brilliance, that scene. Knowing the German language of course lands me in a position to comment on these factors, as the dubbed English version of the film would have taken taken all these factors out of the equation, sadly.",

And that's the point.,"After watching this movie, I was intrigued as to why anyone might have 'hated it', and after reading the relevant IMDb reviews, I think I know. There were actually many reasons given; objections to everything from acting to sets to direction and more, but in light of the movie's evident quality they seemed to be nit-picking at best. The acting is first-rate, as is the rest of 'Downfall'. This is a powerful, gripping movie with characterisations so well-realised (Hitler himself, secretary Traudl, the supremely creepy Josef and Magda Goebbels and many others) they will haunt you. What the 'hated it' reviewers actually didn't like was the humanistic portrayal of Hitler. The hunched, shuffling and twitching 'grandfatherly' Hitler of 'Downfall' is a far cry from the long-familiar vigorous, raving 'madman' incarnations of popular culture. How anyone could have got a 'sympathetic' treatment of Hitler out of this movie is unfathomable. Yes, this Hitler is an ailing, crotchety, prematurely aged and even a vulnerable man; sweet to Eva Braun and his pretty young secretaries, but also the architect of the global madness which has backfired so catastrophically and is even now smashing its way towards him and everyone else hiding in his bunker. It is a tragedy of Shakespearian proportions, and entirely Hitler's doing. All of the executions, infanticide, suicide, revenge atrocities and madness of those last days of the Battle of Berlin are the end product of decades of his work. One of the most vehement 'hated it' criticisms was that the past crimes of the Third Reich (principally the Final Solution) were not detailed in the screenplay, but there is little need to gratuitously invoke the Holocaust with this tsunami of death, destruction and insanity bearing down on Hitler, his associates and his beloved Germany. To leave it as a barely-mentioned background feature makes its creator seem even more reprehensible, not less; because it is as if he didn't care about anything but his place in history. In the end, he is crushed and even tearful that it all ended this way, but he cries for himself, not the millions he has caused to die. Hitler has a human face, and is all the more terrifying for it.",

""Downfall"" (Der Untergang) comes closest to the idea I have not only about the final days in Berlin but of WWII in general. The dialog is straight out of the period with only some minor compromises.

It's a psychological movie about human nature, power and a sense of unity which can carry people beyond total madness.

Historically precise and provided with an enormous amount of artistic intensity, ""The Downfall"" managed to form a cinematic coming to terms with apparently one of the most tragic and in equal terms catastrophic chapters of German history. The more and more appearing senselessness of war and the decaying conception of national socialism are contrasted to the aim of Hitler and his leading elites to continue the war by all means necessary. By the same token the incapability of the principal generals of staff, who are unable to manage, respectively are not willing, to instruct Hitler about the absolutely hopeless situation he maneuvered himself into, is depicted plausibly. In this regard it is essential to point out the acting performed by the main characters resp. the entire cast, for it is the brilliant acting which makes the movie such an intense experience for the audience. Several critics stated that ""The Downfall"" would picture Hitler to human, too much in private moments and that those scenes would distract people from recognizing the delusionally controlled and hate-driven person of Hitler. But it has to be stressed, that just due to the fact it does not conceal Hitlers human and private side but displays it quite obviously, a notion within the audience rises that the evil, the most obnoxious and even the most inhuman ideology might lurk inside of everyone and could possibly find its manifestation. In other words, the danger of such ideology could not be concentrated in this one abstracted evil but in every human at all.",

This movie, perhaps more than any other, tries to answer that question by presenting a unique view of the last days of the Third Reich. It explores the question of why people can be led so easily into hell and the madness of self-destruction by one man, and one idea. The bunker simply serves as a convenient setting to examine this question: after all, it's only at the end, with death imminent, with time for self-reflection, that we can get a really convincing picture of the motives and thinking of those who were involved. ""Why?"": I think that's the central question of this movie. No more, no less. And because of that I think it's one of the most important movies that have been made in a long time, maybe ever.",
242,24 July 2015,lampic,10, Excellent,"""Der Untergang"" (2004) translated as ""Downfall"" for international market is lengthy (almost 3 hours) story about last days in Hitler's underground bunker when he was surrounded with only the most faithful followers as Berlin was being trashed and destroyed by advancing Russian army. The whole world is falling down on him, Third Reich is obviously only a dream that he can't let go,his own soldiers are completely destroyed (only soldiers left to protect Berlin are kids recruited as ""Hitler Jugend"") and even people in the bunker are only here because they have no other alternative. Yes, movie is German and based on several war memoirs of survivors who were there - historian Joachim Fest actually wrote a book ""Inside of Hitler's Bunker"" and he helped with making a script true to reality, but this is only part of the reason why the movie is such a strong experience. I have read a lot about this and all those scenes, sentences and even gestures actually happened (when disillusioned with his own generals, Hitler goes to congratulate to teenagers who are still fighting on the streets of Berlin and awkwardly grabs boy's cheek) - and than, there is acting. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel didn't just go for visual similarity though this has been achieved and can be checked with shocking results, he has calmly and objectively showed psychological turmoil these people experienced, their fears, refusals to accept the reality and nightmare that became their lives. Swiss actor Bruno Ganz is so perfect that watching him is chilling, almost scary experience - from the voice mannerisms to hand shaking to pathological switch between rage, illogical monologues, charming politeness and racist ramblings he IS the man crashing down completely. There is the whole team of excellent actors who were used to great effect even though their roles appear small - Eva Braun (Juliane Köhler) is beautiful, submissive and forcefully cheerful like she is pushing herself and everybody around to enjoy, dance and have good time (just one more cigarette) but than she sits alone in front of the mirror and in a stunning, wordless scene watches herself, gazing at the reality and death approaching. The whole Goebbels family re-creating suicide exactly as it happened, with soldiers waiting around the corner to burn their bodies. Young, naive secretary (Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl Junge) hoping until the last moment that this is not the end and not understanding the seriousness of situation. Just watch the face of Albert Speer (brilliant actor Heino Ferch) as he listen her naive questions - he says not a word and just looks at her. These moments when characters actually don't talk, just a glance or look, it says it all. ",
243,28 March 2006,Tecun_Uman,10, Chilling and Essential,"I think every person on earth should be required to view this film. I can think of no other film that does as good of job of relaying the horrors of war and in particular, the tragedy that the Nazis brought upon Germany. Certainly nobody could dare to profess an admiration for Hitler after seeing what he did to Germany. This film helps relate those last few days as Nazi leaders cower in their bunker and bark orders to other Germans on the outside to keep fighting and dying. Moreover, when we are forced to view the deaths of the six Goebbels children, well, it is almost too much. The performances and the writing are just top notch. I don't think I have ever seen a movie so realistic in details and this is of course because the movie is based on the testimony of Germans that were actually there experiencing this as it happened. Powerful, very powerful",
244,2 February 2006,sol-,6, My brief review of the film,"Heavy but generally well made, this film has been marketed as being about Adolf Hitler's final days and his downfall; it is actually more about the downfall of the Nazis on the whole, with Bruno Ganz in very much a supporting role as Hitler. It sounds like a very positive thing that the film explores more than just Hitler's own downfall, however in execution, the film appears far too busy. There is a lot going on to be followed, as the film chases many different plot lines, without any real focus. Also, it is a bit too talkative to be followed at times. It feels drawn out despite all that is going on because suspense and tension is to a degree jarred by the jumping between all the different events. As lengthy as it might seem at two and a half hours long, a three-hour duration could have been a bit more appropriate. Either way, the visual side of the film is perfect for the project, with an appropriately washed out colour scheme, realistic sets and camera-work to match. Ganz is also very good as Hitler, slowly but surely maddening, and it is an amazement to watch whenever he is on screen - which in turn makes it a shame that such moments exist in less than half of the film's running time. Overall, this is a film worth watching for its realistic and harrowing depiction of the downfall of the Nazi stronghold in Germany, and for the work by Bruno Ganz. Otherwise though, it is not a film for everyone, with its large amount content squeezed into two and a half hours - but that does not mean that it is not a good film.",
245,23 June 2017,svikasha,9, The Downfall Offers a Rare Chance to Witness the Collapse of the Nazi Regime,"Hollywood loves to depict World War Two. The Second World War has overwhelmingly been the setting of choice for major filmographic depicts of war. But the German film industry, for understandable reasons, has been much more hesitant to produce such films. To be fair, how does a filmmaker depict such a period in human history? How does one do justice to its tragic nature without glorifying the carnage? It isn't easy to depict Adolph Hitler on screen accurately without risking alienating and horrifying a great number of people. Such a task is especially not worth attempting on a budget of only 13.5 million. This fact alone makes the 2004 German film ""Der Untergang"" an accomplishment worthy of acknowledgement. ",
246,8 April 2005,houndtang75,10, Brilliant,"Downfall is truly an excellent film. One of those rare pictures where you can forget you are watching actors and actually believe in them as the real people they are playing. Bruno Ganz is uncanny as Hitler, and the supporting cast is uniformly fine. There is no music, just the dull thud of the Russian shells in the background. Although there have been many war films, the fall of Berlin, one of the most dramatic events of the 20th Century, has been neglected by filmmakers. It's good that it is a German film that has brought this period to the forefront again.

War pictures are not meant to be historical documents, as many would believe. The movie industry will never make historically accurate films. Historically based films should do their best to interpret text, photographs, footage; and then only attempt to paint a coherent picture of what happened.

She died in 2002 and in the documentary I'm toten Winkel - Hitlers Sekretärin / Blind Spot - Hitler's Secretary she is interviewed and the script of Der Untergang / Downfall is also based on that interview. The problem I have with her is that I just can not believe her naivety. Yes, she admits in the end of Der Untergang (taken from that documentary) that she should have known better.

256,14 December 2005,EUyeshima,4," Hitler's Last Hours in Excruciating, Desultory Detail","Spending over 2 ½ hours witnessing the last hours of Adolf Hitler's life doesn't sound like an exhilarating time, and director Oliver Hirschbiegel's 2004 German-language film has to be one of the more deflating experiences I've had at the movies recently. But that's not to say there aren't moments of great power and passionate, truthful performances. In fact, it feels like quite a breakthrough to have the story actually done in German as it seems targeted to the German populace versus the rest of us interested only in the historical details from the outside. Regardless, the overall effect is enervating from the intentionally methodical approach the filmmaker takes in chronicling the waning moments of the Third Reich. The focal point obviously is the Führer, and Bruno Ganz is powerfully persuasive in alternating between gentility and irrationality but all the while descending into a palpable dementia. It's a vividly rendered performance, which captures all his seeping paranoia and despicable philosophies. The trick for Hirschbiegel and Ganz is not to humanize him to the point of having the viewer feel compassion for this mass murderer because even sixty years after the end of World War II, he continues to exert a powerful fascination. We are intrigued by the psychological forces that gave rise to German National Socialism and shaped its leader, and they successfully pull off the queasy balance of presenting a man who -- before he commits suicide -- speaks with pride about his annihilation of the Jews in Europe. For Hitler and his immediate supporters, the idea of facing the opposition and accounting for those war crimes was unthinkable.",

If we all decide that Hitler was not a human being, but a devil or demon, or something of that nature, then we will doom ourselves to let another human being rise through the ranks to be a brutal dictator with intentions of world domination and ethnic cleansing.

(that is sarcasm, for those unable to detect it). Bruno Ganz has produced the ultimate portrayal of the paper hanger, and makes all other portrayals to date look like cartoon characters. That said, No, it doesn't make me sympathetic to Hitler. Yes, it shows him with human foibles, and not simply as the monster he is usually shown as (simply because its safer to do so). That he was evil is without question, and Downfall does nothing to try and persuade you otherwise. It makes the statement that this happened, and can happen again because of human gullibility, stupidity and pigheadedness. One only has to look at a certain fellow in the US at the moment! The rest of the cast is superb, so good in fact that I would not be surprised to find that many of them would be unable to get regular work because of it, finding that like Andy Robinson of Dirty Harry fame, that they have been type cast for being too good. The cinematography is flawless, the action (more hinted at than shown, as it deals more with the bunker than the war itself) is scary, and I can only thank my parents that I was born when and where I was, as being involved in this mess...well you get the idea.",
265,14 April 2008,imdbfriend,9, Downfall of Hitler!! Rise of the Cinema and Bruno Ganz!!,"This movie belongs to Bruno Ganz for depicting the title role of Hitler, and believe me it is one of the best acting in a biographical role I have ever seen on screen. Maria Lara as Hitler's secretary too is very well depicted role and the story is from her point the way she sees Hitler in his final days. Acting from others too is very good, direction is excellent, music score is good, and camera work too is top notch. I didn't understand how to react to this movie after first viewing, should I be sympathetic to the characters or should I be happy for the end, as WWII and atrocities of Hitler is the worst in the history as far as my knowledge goes, but I will say this that I was stunned by the movie 100%. It is that good. The effort by the team of this movie must be applauded for there amazing work and bringing history closer to us in the movie in a best form possible. Watch it if you like the subject of war, knowing more about Hitler and his last days. Or just watch to see the amazing work of Bruno Ganz.",

Adolf Hitler,"Downfall (2004) **** This powerful and thought provoking drama with great performances just confirmed my delightedness towards German cinema. Now I can surely say that is my favorite of all European cinemas. Starting with brilliant silent pictures such as ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' (1919), ''Nosferatu''(1922) Fritz Lang's ''Metropolis''(1927), through masterpieces in early talky era (''M'' and ''Dr. Mabuse''), then ''The Thin Drum'', ''Das Boot'' or ''Wings of Desire'' in 1970s and 1980s and finally with superb modern movies such as ''Nowhere in Africa'', ''Goodbye, Lenin!'', ''Head-On'' and, of course, this gem. All great movies from various directors in various periods. Excuse me for noting all that in this comment, but I was enchanted after I saw this grim and moving picture... Well, it's said enough. ''Downfall'' is refreshing, dialog  driven, beautifully told movie with some absolutely amazing characterizations and performances. Paralax  perspective gave it an extra credit and profoundness in portraying this highly-controversial subject. Bravo!",
267,8 April 2005,buiger,8, Definitely worth watching,"I find the greatest assets of the film to be its total historic accuracy and complete realism. It is absolutely believable, some scenes are even hard to watch, but this is what it was like. The depiction of the moral decay that overwhelms doomed men and women is awesome in its cruel veracity. In other, I think that Bruno Ganz did a fantastic job in physically impersonating Hitler, but lacked in the oral interpretation (I watched the original German version). Also, I found some of the schizophrenic aspects of Hitler's character to be a little overblown, as well as the characterization of Eva Braun a little superficial. All in all though, a very good film worth sitting in for 2 1/2 hours.",
268,13 February 2021,dgcampo,9, Incredible historical piece,"I was struck most by the degree of humanity that Mr. Ganz gave Adolf Hitler. He accentuates both his angry side and his more sedate side fantastically. There are also scenes in this movie where Mr. Ganz portrays Adolf Hitler as vulnerable, and other times he's even portrayed him as somewhat sweet. These characterizations; of course, come nowhere near mitigation for the evils of this man released on the planet. Even the most vicious of tyrants can show her humanistic side on occasion. Nevertheless; this movie was an incredible historical recount of Adolf Hitler's last days. Mr. Ganz; in my humble opinion, did an incredible job of portraying this complex individual. All of the acting in this movie is top rate. I must admit; I was brought here by the parody videos on YouTube. Nevertheless, I'm glad I was led here as this was an exceptional dramatic performance.",

Clint got the nod that year but Bruno Ganz's omission is somewhat of a head scratcher. Suffice to say, Ganz and Downfall transcends the 'foreign film category' in which it was designated. Such is Ganz's portrayal that it's easy to believe-and not a little unnerving to sense that, along with the assembled cast, you are also subject to the rantings of a deranged psychotic dictator. The cast, by the way, are phenomenal and Oliver Hirschbiegel's retelling of Traudle Junge's first hand experience is nothing less than a tour de force.",

It did not add much to the story, but it displayed even more atmospheric scenes, and every scene with Bruno Ganz as Hitler is worth seeing and witnessing the insanity of the events over 60 years ago. In total, the extended TV version adds about 26 minutes to the film, totaling 175 minutes. The German version has English subtitles (I quote the German DVD technical information since I watched it on TV, not DVD). If you can watch, it, it is worth it. It is likely, though, that it will be close to never that it will appear in any other language. I remember the movie Das Boot which hit the screen only in a cut version. Recently, it came out on DVD in German language with English subtitles for the first time. So it may be you need a code free DVD player to be able to watch the Region Code 2 German DVD to get the whole story film.",

Perhaps the director wisely understands that no one really walks into a Hitler film without a mountain of context and historical understanding of the inevitability of the conclusion. And yet, as one watches these individuals in their lifelike realism--less monster, more unfortunate, lost human--one wonders if this all was so inevitable after all if only better men and women could have risen at the right times instead of Hitler.

I had not heard of this movie but I loved Bruno Ganz from Wings of Desire. His performance of Hitler was extraordinary. This was no caricature (such as Anthony Hopkins or Derek Jacobi) but flesh and blood and terrifying, especially at the end. All the acting was first rate but Carinna Harfouch and Ulrich Matthes and the Goebbels were so horrifying that I had to tell myself they were actors at the end. I have never seen two monsters portrayed so realistically. The scene with the children at the end will stay with me always. (And I've read about what they did and seeing it reinforced my unbelief at the inhumanity of these two, not that Hitler and the Germans were any different but this scene just really shocked me.) However, I did find Traudl Junge's innocence at the beginning unbelievable; I cannot believe she didn't know what was happening, especially being up close and right after the war, assuming she really was that stupid, she should have seen the light.",

Indeed, I think it must be the most engaging and thought-provoking WWII movie I have seen. If this had been a Hollywood production with Hollywood stars it would not have had this impact, but it is German-made and its director (Oliver Hirschbiegel) seemed to go out of his way to avoid leading the viewer to any conclusion, instead allowing everyone to form their own opinion based on the facts. Too often the horrors of WWII led writers and directors to depict Nazis as monsters, but this misses the real story; the question of how they became monsters. In a way, the human Hitler which Hirschbiegel shows us is more guilty than a raving monster since it is clear he made choices to do wrong.",

Fully accurate or not, it feels like we're looking at real people. On a certain level, you almost feel bad for them. Its by no means an apology piece for the Nazi party, but it gives us a perspective I haven't yet seen in a movie. The performance from Bruno Ganz as Hitler was terrific.

Exactly the latter happened to ""Der Untergang"" (2004): Director Hirschbiegel was most heavily criticizes through weeks in the boulevard tableaux because he did not dissociate himself from the ""benevolent and favorable"" picture that Traudl Junge (on whose memories the film is based) gave about her former boss Hitler. Indeed: Somebody who watches this movies without the burden of allegedly commonly borne (and ""suffered"") past, he or she may sense Hitler as a bearer of sympathy: He does not drink nor smoke, eats only vegetarian and small-sized meals, drinks herb-tea and no coffee, is not pro miscue and loves animals and children over anything.

It is told through the eyes of one of Hitler's final secretaries. As well as detailing her experiences, it also closely follows the story of a doctor, a young boy and Hitler himself. What is unique about this film compared with most World War II-related movies, is that it tells a story from the perspective of the ""enemy."" In addition, it's also unusual in that it is neither condemning nor condoning of the events that take place. It non-judgmentally observes the events as they unfold. As defeat becomes more evident, each character finds his or her own rationalization to cope with the reality. Some steadfastly cling to their National-Socialist beliefs while others watch as their leader begins to spiral downward into mental delusion and his Parkinson's Disease grows increasingly more severe.

Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler is a good lookalike, a good character, and makes him a very good villain. I've always wanted to see Hitler played by someone, and played in a German film by Ganz, he makes a very evil man a reality. Also starring Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl Junge, Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels, Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels, Juliane Köhler as Eva Braun and Heino Ferch as Albert Speer.

Downfall is a sympathetic, though never forgiving, portrayal of him, and it works best when it remains focused on him. Bruno Ganz's performance is incendiary. It would seem to me that the role of Germany's Furher may be the most difficult role this side of Jesus Christ, and Ganz plays him with a middling sense of teetering insanity.

As an under-informed American, these facts and this perspective were new to me, even as some one that has studied WWII and the Nazi state extensively, in university and independently. I feel that, unfortunately, there will be detractors about any movie about this or any other emotionally charged and polarizing subject matter. There are no universal aesthetics the filmmakers could use that would please everyone; the caricature of the Nazis as monsters and the German civilians as blind followers has preformed the rest of the world's opinions as to what is the most ""accurate"" portrayal of this subject. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to forget the caricatures and Riefenstahl's immortal presentation of these historical figures, and see them as flawed, deluded and twisted human beings. Because these WERE humans, and I find that to be the most important thing to remember when learning about Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, The Great Leap Forward, the hard-line Islamic take-over of Iran, the removal and extermination campaigns waged against indigenous people in the New World...name your tragedy, and there is a logical ""noble"" philosophy behind it, being adhered to with blinded fervor. It was carried out by human beings, not monsters, not madmen. People following a deadly and cold line of logic to a bitter and bloody end. That was what this movie made all the more clear to me.",

I mean, there might be a lesser degree of depression related to it because we are watching the demise of the Nazi regime, and these are genocidal murderers after all. But they take you into the inner sanctum and we look on as these men and women watch their lives quickly coming to an end. Even when they are fascist generals, it's kind of rough seeing this number of suicides, and how even the women and children are expected to go down with the ship. There was a certain point where I was thinking ""Enough already!"" as one more soldier blew his own brains up. I understand that they are aiming for a level of authenticity in the story-telling, and these events did happen when the Axis had lost the war, but watching it play out in this slow methodical fashion is exhausting.",
292,28 August 2015,GanzEhrlich,10, A Masterpiece when it comes to war movies!,"Downfall (Der Unterang in Germany), the story of Hitler and the other political staff in his Berlin bunker as the Soviets advance towards them, could well be described as a war movie like no other. It tends to use emotional violence, rather than physical, graphic war violence to pummel you (there are few instances of it, I'll admit that). Furthermore, instead telling the story of, say, a group of soldiers fighting for victory, there are no real heroes to root for, and plenty of unpleasant, confused politicians in their place. With realism applied, not even Bruno Ganz portraying Hitler stands out in terms of evil-mindedness (Mr. and Mrs. Goebbels are even worse).

The film is well worth having to read subtitles. Having watched Bruno Ganz as Hitler, it's impossible for me to imagine anyone else playing the part. The testimony of one of the inhabitants of the bunker is particularly effective, especially since she does not excuse herself but, in fact, accuses herself.

294,4 April 2005,carol-160,10, Unshakeable Loyalty,"A striking aspect of this highly accurate portrayal of Hitler's last days was the unshakable loyalty displayed by many Germans even at the darkest hour when the end was clear. We must remember that Hitler was enormously popular up until the invasion of Poland. His personal popularity remained high throughout the war years despite his increasingly despotic rule. It is a warning to us today just how easy it is for a cultured population to strongly support amoral leaders who pander to fear and a twisted sense of morality. Although it was not visible in the film, the motto cast on every German army belt buckle was ""Gott Mit Uns"" - God is with us! Today our subhumans are not ""Bolshevik Jews"" but ""terrorists"".",
295,13 May 2005,Swifttraveler,10, The film Downfall covers new ground in the war film genre.,"Everyone, regardless of age, has heard something about World War II; as a result, the filmmaker's dilemma is that he or she must show an aspect of the war that is unusual and therefore worth the time and money spent filming. No one benefits from cliché. The last ten days in the lives of the major players--Hitler, Eva Braun, and the Goebbels--as depicted in Downfall, appeals to the viewer who wants to get past what has already been attempted in the war films of the past 60 years. Having said that, any film on World War II will be expected to get the facts right, e.g. the time and manner of Adolf Hitler's death. What is harder to depict is the feelings individuals had about life as they were living it. An art film such as Downfall walks a line between exact correspondence to historical fact and the filmmaker's (and viewers') desire to slant the action toward the interpretation that is most acceptable to a humane, reflective, and well-considered view of ""reality."" What I require of art film as well as biography is a focused perception of this reality, something that raises the human spirit, and our need to triumph over base human motives. The ""reality"" is that in April 1945, the people who worked for Hitler felt differently about the end. Only a few people planned to kill themselves in the bunker with Hitler; most people wanted to survive the end of the war, and get on with their lives--whateer that might be. This point is reinforced throughout the film in the female roles: there are several weepy women who felt they couldn't live without their ""Fuehrer,"" and, in contrast, there were those women (and men) who could walk away after the Russian entry into Berlin, those with the will and knowledge to live on. The culmination of this theme of ambivalent service to Hitler comes near the end when the Nazi doctor argues with an officer: the officer intends to commit suicide, and the doctor can't believe how anyone would choose that. Thus, it seems to me that some people thought it was an honor to kill themselves for Hitler, others were killed by Nazis because they saw what was happening as wrong. Another point is that several people/characters asked Hitler to surrender ""for the sake of the German"" people; it became clear that Hitler never gave a damn about the people who ""served"" him nor about the German Nation. The filmmakers were wise to have the telling of the story cohere around the secretary, Trudl Jung--a sort of ""innocent"" bystander who decided that what she did not know was not going to hurt her. In other words, the secretary was the Everyman who thinks ignorance is bliss. This film has reminded me that real power requires checks and balances on excess; and that people who believe in humanity must speak out against genocide (e.g. the Sudan, Rwanda). See related films, Hotel Rwanda and an older film, The Garden of the Finzi-Continis.",

The cinematography is excellent. A few of the scenes looked almost identical to those in The Pianist, another great movie. Bruno Ganz is outstanding as Hitler; I keep wondering where I've seen Ganz before. Needless to say he confirmed my thoughts that Der Fuhrer was a complete nut job! It's a wonder he didn't have a stroke every five minutes. I am always amazed that the Nazis were so fanatically loyal to the point of killing off their children rather than surrender. And although I can hardly compare Hitler to our own President George W. Bush, we do have those in our country who seem to support him no matter what. I especially like Thomas Kretchmann who seems to bring something new to every Nazi he plays (as in The Pianist). The battle scenes are fantastic too; just trying to imagine the director setting up such wonderful shots is enough to warrant a second look. I got a little chuckle seeing Hitler eat ravioli like it was the last thing on earth and they always seemed to have plenty of booze too. I won't get philosophical about the film; much has been written etc. about the Holocost and all that. I have the movie for 5 days so I think I'll watch it again. Riveting!",
297,19 April 2005,come2whereimfrom,9, downfall stands-up,"Downfall: Two and a half hours in the company of Hitler was never going to be easy going. But this film was so powerful it had you glued to your seat not noticing the time. Bruno Ganz (from 'wings of desire' (a favourite of mine)) gives a career performance as Hitler. He is so like him you could almost be watching a documentary. Which is what I did the night after I'd been to see it. You see I learnt some stuff at school and then some stuff from other films. But downfall made me realise I didn't really know enough, so the history channel it was for me and after several documentaries on old Hitler's rise to power and subsequent slaughter of thousands of innocent people, I was ready to think a bit more about this film. It is well directed, acted and shot, but the real controversy is in the fact that it shows Hitler as being in some respects quite normal. Nice to his dog, secretary and the children of fellow officers everywhere. He is shown as a frail old man with a bit of a temper. Don't get me wrong he is shown also as the monster he almost certainly was but I think its easier for people to understand the terrible things he did if they can somehow make out he was just pure evil. A bit like does the queen use the toilet? Of course she must but people don't see it that way. The fact that Hitler ate sensibly (vegetarian) didn't drink or smoke, loved art and was a good speaker, wouldn't warrant much hate against him. But to think off him as a cold-blooded killer helps us to kind of accept that he happen to kill 50 million people. The film is trying to lift the mask placed on Hitler by everyone. And in a way it does, it is slightly pleasing to see his end when it comes, and along the way it raises some very interesting questions. It is as much a psychological study of power and corruption as it is a war film and I think it should be shown in schools everywhere.",
298,4 April 2006,Mafisto-1,10, Best War Movie I've Ever Seen,"Too many times in American film, or any war film, one side is demonized. It is an important movie for Americans who often like to view themselves as flawless heroes. It is always easy to think of Hitler as a monster or to make a parody him. The difficult part is to realize that he was human as well. Even more so, many of the Nazis had a very human struggle and it can be disturbing to some because their plight draws a remarkable resemblance to our own. Because of this, it raises deeper questions that are usually ignored in this genre. Most war movies are bordering on propaganda, but Downfall isn't. It's the best war movie I can ever remember seeing.",
299,10 September 2008,Cosmoeticadotcom,8, Best Hitler film ever?,"n the annals of film, the greatest screen portrayal of an evil world leader was undoubtedly Anthony Hopkins' 1995 turn as President Richard M. Nixon in Oliver Stone's Nixon. Within five to ten minutes of one's first glimpse of Hopkins- a Brit who looked and sounded nothing like the 37th American President, one almost forgets what the real Nixon looked like. But, now there's a contender who could knock Hopkins off his perch- or at least give him a good fight, and that is Bruno Ganz's turn as Adolf Hitler in the 2004 Academy Award nominated Best Foreign Language Film from Germany, Downfall (Der Untergang- literally The Downfall). What makes this all the more remarkable is that- unlike Nixon, many actors have tried and failed to get into Hitler's skin, including the aforementioned Hopkins, who took on the role in The Bunker (1981). In fact, Ganz is so great at portraying Hitler- and he looks far more like the real Hitler than Hopkins did Nixon, even sans the Chaplinesque mustache and combover, that the film took much criticism for portraying Hitler as a real live human being. Heaven forfend that art contain some reality, or 'truth,' as the PC Elitists claim! Ganz is brilliant- from his wild veering between depression and rages, to his jittery nervousness, and a shaking of his hands which, when held behind his body, seem to devolve almost into the claw of a wounded raptor, grasping for anything to steady his older than he looks fifty-six year old form. In fact, Ganz seems to age and literally shrink in size, as he stoops and hunches, with each succeeding scene. Yet, it's the moments of tenderness Hitler shows his fiancée/wife, Eva Braun, his wounded indignation at perceived betrayals, and his timidity toward women, as well as impeccable manners, that really offends the PC. This ability to move a viewer is, of course, the manifestation of the great art of a great artist.",

Most chilling is the extinction of the Goebbels family. The guilty also take away with them the innocent who are associated with them, such as the children and the dog.

Most of us are used to seeing Hitler as a raving lunatic standing behind microphones. But what was it like to know the man personally? Oliver Hirschbiegel's movie ""Der Untergang"" (""Downfall"" in English) is based on the memoirs of Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge. It focuses mainly on Hitler's final few days alive in the Führerbunker, where he hid with a number of acolytes as the Third Reich imploded. Bruno Ganz plays Hitler, forced to realize that Germany is facing certain defeat (and he looks as if he's developing Parkinson's). Almost as monstrous as Nazism's founder is Magda Goebbels, who casually poisons her own children and proceeds to play cards as if nothing has happened.",

307,31 October 2007,Dr_Coulardeau,9, One can never forget the evil they have taken part in,"This film is tragic. It shows the fall of Berlin in the hands of the Soviets in April-May 1945 in the most realistic way possible. But the film decides to show the event from inside the inner circle around Hitler himself in his bunker and there we are surprised . First we are surprised because the film insists too much on the insanity and degenerating disease or sickness of the Führer. It is so simple to say he was crazy, megalomaniac, schizophrenic, the victim of some degenerative disease. It is so easy that it becomes some kind of an excuse for the crimes he committed. But this vision surrounds Hitler with people who are either yellow bellies or fanatics. Yellow bellies in front of Hitler and that makes them accept anything. Fanatics, like the Goebbels, to the point of poisoning their children. And the fanatics are holding the yellow bellies in line. Too easy in many ways since some of these yellow bellies will be tried, convicted and sentenced as guilty in Nuremberg. The last explanation is provided in the film with the testimony of Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary. They were young and they should have been more curious in order to learn what was really happening. Günther Grass in a recent book more or less defends the same opinion, though with less one-sidedness. Yes he says they knew a lot more than some might have pretended, but they did not look or see or think it was in any way important. Grass goes slightly further and pretends they had been well conditioned and formatted by Nazi propaganda, which is another half truth again. These survivors, and it is true on the other side too, like among the French resistance, needed in those difficult times to believe without any doubt what some adults were telling them. They needed to follow the line set in front of them in order to become adults, to believe in themselves. There is even one more element that is generally forgotten. These young people needed to accept the authority of an order that was bigger than them in order to be worth living, and that implied they had to suffer in order to get this worthy self-belief, self-respect, self-pride. Some even go as far as considering that dying in the most reckless way for a cause is a sacrifice, a human sacrifice mind you, a voluntary and willing human sacrifice for an absolutely justified cause. I am afraid that all survivors develop this idea, this attitude, just to be able to survive, that is to say to forget what they have to forget if they want to keep their sanity after the events, no matter what they may be. The film here is not centered on this issue, but it supposes the issue, whereas Günther Grass addresses the issue directly and then rewrites his ""memories"", pretending they are all fake and false in all possible ways, in order to retain the little sanity history has decided to grant him the privilege of enjoying. But it is a false truth in many ways because the disguising of the truth in order to survive also feeds the guilty conscience that haunts the surviving years.",

Whoever plays Hitler gives an excellent and noteworthy performance. For once Hitler is actually portrayed as a human being, capable of more than just being a fanatical megalomaniac (as he certainly was). What really strikes you in this movie are two things: a.) The total and absolute destruction of the German state Hitler has led his people into (as evidenced by the ongoing Battle of Berlin, fought by fanatical Hitler Youth and aging conscripts b.) The lunacy of the 3rd Reich, the grotesque, twisted mind of Hitler and the hard to comprehend complete obedience he demanded (and received) from his people. ",

It is very well filmed, but offers no new historical perspective except perhaps to present Hitler as something more than a one-dimensional monster. Its biggest flaw is its sense of repetitiveness. There are countless scenes of Hitler meeting with his generals and discussing flawed tactics. Then the suicide scenes start and these go on forever.

326,27 November 2007,Lejink,8, Bunker mentality,"Remember the old TV programme from the 70's ""You were There"", putting the young viewer seemingly at the scene of a historical event - well this movie does that for adults, the authenticity aided of course by the characters conversing in the native German language. The movie of course has to walk a thin line between humanising these infamous characters from history without eliciting sympathy for any of them and succeeds by playing it straight. The only characters from the Nazi camp you really feel for are the innocent Goebbels children in one of the most chilling scenes when their mother, with her husband, the most ardent Nazi of all, who cannot see a place in the future for her infant offspring if the Third Reich fails and silently administers their poison pills after they have been drugged to sleep. The film interestingly does not hold back in its depiction of the real- life horror of the situation, many suicides for example are graphically rendered while contrastingly the camera pans away from the suicides of Hitler, Braun and the Goebbels. The drama also depicts life for ordinary Germans outside the bunker caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place, slaughtered either by their hardline SS countrymen or the invading Russian Red Army, focusing in particular on one small child who sees carnage all around him but comes together at the end with Hitler's idealistic young secretary who cannot offer the ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction taken by so many of the bunker's co-habitants. The performances are uniformly excellent, Bruno Ganz conveying Hitler's detached psychopathy in his crazed outbursts and yet still able to captivate the young pretty socialite Eva Braun. Cult of personality indeed. Best performance for me though is that by Corinna Farhouch as Mrs Goebbels, a striking character study of misguided devotion to an abhorrent creed. The creation of the battle-ravaged heart of Berlin is excellently done with several attention-grabbing images which ingrain themselves in the memory. Would it have been better shot in black and white just to complete the realism, however? Perhaps, but that's a minor gripe in what is ultimately a tautly told lesson from history.",
327,14 August 2011,paulimiles,10, Magnificent,"If you were to only ever watch one movie about WW2 then this should be it. An absolutely fabulous interpretation of the last days of one of history's most infamous characters. Incredibly acted by Bruno Ganz, it leaves you wondering how he could possibly not receive the Oscar for his work. It must go down as one of the finest acting performances in history. As others have said, Ganz is Hitler. To say that the movie runs over two hours and is largely shot inside Hitler's bunk, it rarely if ever loses interest. A splendid support cast, authentic if limited action scenes around Berlin and a surprise twist at the end with the secondary story line, all adds up to a magnificent movie. I must say though that the scene involving the fate of Josef Goebbels children is extremely difficult to watch and may haunt you for some time to come after the movie has finished. Superior to even the marvelous Das Boot, this movie is a triumph for all concerned. Without doubt the greatest Anti War movie I have ever watched. 10/10",
328,2 April 2005,sajmal23,9, An amazing movie,This movie really depicted the utter destruction Germany went through under Hitler. It showed how Hitlers madness lead him to the deaths of millions and the people of Germany paid for it. Its amazing the Germany has recovered from the effects of the war but still the wounds of history remain. The acting was superb in the movie especially Bruno Ganz who plays Hitler was awesome he deserves all the praise. The suffering the people went through at that time i cannot even imagine thank god i was not alive in 1945. The movie starts in 1945 and Hitler chooses an assistant. The movie gave me the impression that Hitler was mentally ill leading him to commit crimes against humanity which the German people had to pay for his doings. Overall a magnificent German movie and A MUST SEE by every German/German speaker and movie-goer one of the best war time movies ever and the reviews say that!,

If we compare it with Saving Private Ryan, we get the difference pretty fast. This film try to be objective and want to get a clean radiography of the German way of thinking. I get really impressed with the German patriotism and I stop for a moment and think about something Steven Spielberg's film didn't show. How must had been for the German people to lost that war, for much people the conflict was everything. That is why I think this film is much better than Saving Private Ryan. Oliver Hirschbiegel is not a conformist and doesn't agree with Spielberg simplicity. Good soldiers, bad soldiers and an evil empire. I ignore if Hirschbiegel's film is historically exact, but I'm happy to see at least something new, with great actor as Bruno Ganz in a film that waste emotion.",

The film isn't so much about Adolf Hitler's downfall, an aura built out of the fact it's his presence over most of the posters and so forth twinned with a quite stunning portrayal of the man by Swiss actor Bruno Ganz, as much as it is about the overall downfall of the Nazi party and their top officials located within Hitler's bunker. Crucially, the film does not end with Hitler's death but does so in a manner that sees a montage of sorts, featuring eventual outcomes of most of the other members of Hitler's grouping.

It was a voice that sent chills down my spine. That hypnotic voice, that chilling presence, is nowhere to be found in Oliver Hirschbeigel's Downfall, a powerful but novelistic account of the events that took place in Berlin during the final days of the Second World War. Bruno Ganz portrays the Führer as a broken and defeated man, stooped and palsied, raving about how his generals betrayed him, yet being kind to his wife Eva Braun (Juliane Kohler), his secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara), and his dog Blondi. It is a strong performance and his character fascinates us, yet Ganz' fiery rants as the Führer seem to be overly studied, not emanating from the core of his being.",

The Fuhrer was always shaking his hand also. Did he have PARKKINSONS? The characters in this movie were all right on. There was NOT A SINGLE American!! The Fuhrer was the main character. Boy, those Generals were sure LOYAL to The Fuhrer. He was so mean and hated Jews. This is the FIRST movie I have seen, other than the movie with Robert Carlisle, that portrays Fuhrer, The.

343,6 March 2006,florida87,1, A Flattering Portrait Of An Evil Regime,"I'm resubmitting my review (edited of course), because ""someone"" said it was offensive the first time. What did I say about this movie the first time? To summarize, I gave it a 7 of 10 (rated it a one star to make it easier to find among 300+ reviews, mostly 10 stars). I said it was well made. I also said it glorified an evil regime. I based that on the premise that it did not show a dead Adolf (was that the offensive part, that I didn't address him as Mr. Hitler?). Was his dead body so sacred that they would show everyone else's corpse except his bullet ridden head? Was that too taboo to show in a modern German film, was the filmmaker too scared to show that? I say it wasn't shown because the purpose of this film was to be sympathetic with an old Hitler's plight. Anyway, there were no morally redeeming elements in the film that said the Nazi's were bad, just that it didn't work out the way they wanted it to. I recommend seeing ""Hitler: The Last Ten Days"", or others have liked ""The Bunker"" (I have not seen that one, but will someday). Read Alfred Speers book ""Inside the Third Reich"" also for a more true account of what probably happened. Is this worth seeing, of course. I enjoyed it especially because I'm a history buff of Hitler and his inner circle and their last days (really any of their days and actions they undertook) are fascinating to me. I was just disappointed that it really made Hitler look like such a nice old man when you know he was a power mad psycho and was surrounded by fanatic death squads at his disposal. He had recently finished his purge of his enemies (plus others I'm sure) from the failed coup of 1944, people were petrified with fear of him! Remember the stories of being hung by piano wire that he filmed and watched over and over again? That moment would have been nice to include here to show how evil he was, but no, no mention of that. My favorite parts had more to do with the collapsing German Army in Berlin and what resulted than on the actual Hitler moments. We'll see if those who seem to love this film so much find this review offensive because all it is is my opinion of the truth. Sometimes, especially for the political left (maybe it was a present day Nazi who didn't like my first review who knows, I do know a lot of leftists seem to like this movie a whole lot), the truth hurts so much they resort to censorship to quell debate. Hell, if I pressed that offensive button on the reviews I found offensive here at IMDb it wouldn't be a very interesting place to visit.

Great performance by Granz as Hitler and the guy that played Goebbels also did a solid job. A pretty long movie, but if you are into WW2 history, it is very solid and worth watching, lots of scenes of gripping tension between Hitler and his Generals and it is nice to see someone interviewed that was actually there at the time (hitler's secretary, which the film opens up with).

The acting is superb, with the complex mix of emotions the people (I can't call them ""characters"" since they were all real people) conveyed very well. You can feel the hopelessness, the sense of loss, the fear, the courage, the fanaticism and the madness the movie is trying to convey. By the end, I finally realized my jaw was hanging open, though I can not honesty say how long it was that way.

Ranging from full-throated demagogue to crushed old man, he dominates the film, even when he isn't on screen, supported by some excellent performances from Corinna Harfouch and Ulrich Matthes as the odious Dr and Mrs Goebbels and Juliane Köhler as an Eva Braun who isn't perhaps as much of an airhead as we like to think. Add in the doe-eyed Alexandra Maria Lara and a wonderfully claustrophobic bunker set where you can almost smell the people boxed up for days on end, and you have a wonderful film. It isn't always comfortable viewing, but it's hugely compelling.",

INCREDIBLE ACTING.",This is a German film about the last few days of the war and Hitler's reign as seen from within the walls of the Fuhrer's bunker. We are given a unique perspective of the desperate last few moments of Germany's dictator as his mental state becomes more unstable and he swings from fantasies of a last minute victory with invisible forces to hopelessness and a vengeful sense of betrayal. We are also given a glimpse of the horror faced by ordinary Berliners as a result of the overwhelming assault of allied forces.,

However, this is not a universal reality, as many of these films fail to capture the horror of war and thus end up glamorizing it. Downfall is about as real as war movies get; the historical (not to mention visual) accuracy of the film, guided by Oliver Hirschbiegel's expert direction and Bruno Ganz's stunning portrayal of Adolf Hitler, makes for a tour de force that is both captivating and educational. Once, the people of the Third Reich were optimistic and fervent in their belief in National Socialism and European conquest; as World War II's final curtain falls, they succumb to grim realization that the fight is over and their leader has betrayed their trust and brought on, out of his own madness, the destruction of the Fatherland.

Bruno Ganz did a fantastic job of portraying Hitler during the final days of the Third Reich as it crumbled around him. All of the actors and actresses in this movie really nailed their parts as well. When the movie is over, all you can do is say ""Wow"". You'll actually believe you're watching archival footage from World War II. The sets are expansive and the special effects are extraordinary. The fact that the entire movie is in German and Russian adds a certain amount of authenticity as well. Kudos to the director for not glamorizing Hitler and showing him as the monster he truly was. A special surprise awaits at the end of the movie.",

But this movie handled it well by depicting striking images and great shocking moments. What's lacking in my opinion is that the war scenes don't really get the real war aura, especially after we see what's done in Saving Private Ryan. But then again, the main focus of Hitler's surroundings on his final days at the bunker really captivated me as I watched this movie. Bruno Ganz acted out nicely in this movie. Before I see this movie, I have seen parodies of the angry Hitler scenes here and there and I wondered what movie was those from. Now that I found the original movie, it makes sense why people choose Ganz's Hitler character as the closest to the real person.",

My high expectations have been fulfilled and I will add this Oscar nominated work for best foreign language film no doubt to my best of DVD collection. It's fast paced with lot of emotional, dramatic and action scenes and I never got bored. Sometimes I had even to laugh on some ridiculous decisions of Hitler. I have to admit that there were perhaps too many bloody suicides in this story. Anyway, director Hirschbiegel shows in a very authentic way the dramatic end of the third Reich. I am also surprised how great Bruno Ganz was in characterizing Hitler so deep and with its voice. All the humanity should never forget that this murder is responsible for the death of millions of innocent people and I recommend to watch this documentation to every one. I hope there will never be a WWIII. Rating: 7.5/10.",

367,9 April 2005,thrillerclub,9, What's Wrong with this picture?,"This movie is a major breakthrough in the art of telling history in a media that usually comes up short on accuracy. But there are problems, such as selective editing obscuring actual communication and statements. By leaving out minor important details, even this agenda-bender tends in subtle ways to reinforce the perception, for instance, that Hitler was practically senile and in complete denial about the inevitable end. In point of fact, to certain associates he lucidly admitted that the war with Russia could never be won; and in rare moments of honesty brushed aside notions that any armies were coming to save Berlin. These people were not stupid or completely crazy. Perhaps they clutched at straws, but in the diaries and specific day to day communications, Goebbels and Hitler were putting up a front for the others, they themselves weren't as deluded as edits make them out to be. What's missing from the film are about a thousand pages of inter-office memos, private discussions and phone conversations that reveal they're saying very different things to one another ranging sometimes to the total opposite, yet keeping it all sorted out. Hitler was often lucid with a surprising grasp of reality when he'd let his guard down in the bunker; including more baffling contradictions of that aspect of Hitler's personality might have revealed more of his inner motivations. ",
368,4 August 2005,Pigalina,8, Fantastic and informative,"Downfall is a great film. It follows the last few days of Hitler, he has turned into a crazy old beast (not that he was the sanest of creatures beforehand). He now no longer cares what happens to the Germans and his regime is falling apart as he makes ridiculous military decisions that are doomed to fail. Goebbels, Hitler's Minister of Propaganda, is played by an scary looking man, he has very angular features. The person I ended up hating the most out of this film though wasn't Hitler, but Goebbel's wife who was so into National Socialism that she took to her bed saying that without National Socialism there was no future. She then proceeded to murder all six of her children so that they wouldn't grow up in a world without Nazis. Psycho. You almost, I said almost, feel sorry for Hitler in places. His wife was also a weirdo, blindly following his orders ""you're the Fuhrer"" she tells him even when her pregnant sister's husband is sentenced to death because it is Hitler's will. The scenes of a war-torn, ruined Berlin were excellent, giving a feeling of a real war zone. I really enjoyed this movie because I taught me a lot about what happened in the last days, how Hitler died and why his body wasn't found; how the whole regime came crumbling down.",
369,28 January 2006,johhnywave,8, One of those movies that can't be missed,"Of the many World War II movies, this one is the best you will ever see. Now I am not a big fan of movies that I have to read subtitles for the fact that it takes a little out of the movie for me. Bruno Ganz who played Adolf Hitler had a spectacular performance. Every scene he was in you felt like you were in the room as well. If he is shouting, you are frightened, if he is joyous, you are rejoicing with him. Untergang, Der shows the other side of the war that most movies will leave out. As the movie goes you feel like it is your duty to watch it. There is no downside on any level through out the movie and the further a long it goes the more and more it builds even if it is not meant to. Now a two and a half hour movie may sound like a long time to spend watching a movie but I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed. There are some movies that should be their hour and a half but there are others that need to be the long length they are so you as the viewer will get the movie, live in the movie, and love it.",
370,12 July 2012,tendobear,1, Completely Overrated,"Oh my goodness! What can I say about this film? I had heard so much about this movie, mostly good and positive things, so I wanted to check it out for myself. A WW2 movie from the perspective of Hitler during his last days - intriguing premise and should make a brilliant piece of film right? Boy, was I disappointed; this has got to be one of the most boring films I have ever seen. It's full or clichés, about an hour and a half too long and the pace is incredibly slow - you won't believe how many times I thought to myself: ""just get it over and done with already!"" - even I wanted to kill myself by the halfway mark. But by then I had stopped caring. It does nothing to tell us anything new or refreshing about Hitler's last days, so the whole thing was just completely pointless. Yes, it's supposed to capture just how desperate they all became as the Russians closed in and the leader gradually lost his mind; as if he didn't I suppose the one saving grace of this absolutely terrible movie is Bruno Ganz's portrayal of the Fuhrer; he absolutely nails the great leader down to every little mannerism and nervous tick; you'd think Hitler himself had come back from the dead to be in this movie. But then, not even top-notch acting by Ganz can save this awful movie from its ""downfall"".",
371,12 January 2011,Andy-296,9, The definitive film about Hitler's last days,"A German film about the last days of the Nazi regime, centered on the Fuhrer's bunker, from his 56th birthday on April 20th, 1945 to the fall of Berlin on May 8th. This is certainly a very compelling story (certainly one of the most important stories of the 20th century) and while it has been filmed before, it is the first time it's done in the German language. This makes the movie look far more authentic than when someone like Anthony Hopkins or Alec Guinness played an English speaking Fuhrer. And it has a neat framing device in the story as seen by Hitler's young secretary Traudl Junge. The more compelling parts of the movie, for me, are not the war scenes, but the discussions Hitler has with his closest aides and military staff: Jodl, Krebs, Burgdorf, Keitel, Speer, Wiedling, Mohnke. Most of them know the situation is extremely critical, but they are reluctant to tell the Fuhrer, who is increasingly in denial, promising final victory even after the Russians are only a few kilometers away from his headquarters. Only Goebbels remains completely wedded to the Fuhrer's autistic vision. Even Himmler and Goering, realizing the desperate situation of the Reich try to unsuccessfully arrange negotiations with the allies. These negotiations never got to anything, but Hitler is furious when he learns about them, and consider them both traitors. Bruno Ganz is brilliant as Hitler, but the movie is considerably helped by the strengths of its many characters. For example, Fegelein, who as Himmler's adjutant, tries to convince Hitler and the other people in the bunker that it's best to leave Berlin. Fegelein meets an untimely fate and has become the subject of many internet gags (more on that later). Or Eva Braun, portrayed here as the ultimate dumb blond totally subservient to his man. Or Magda Goebbels, who can be both cold and hysterical. Perhaps the only character whose portrayal is unsatisfying is Joseph Goebbels, since he is played by an actor in a heavy and ridiculous white make up. Also strange is the decision to have Goering appear in only one scene and without a speaking role, just looking impatiently at his watch. I remember that when the movie came out, some critics thought the movie was pro Nazi, in that it understood Hitler too much. I think with time it is clear that this charge is ridiculous. This movie clearly shows the delusion of Hitler and the terrible philosophy of the Nazis: no compassion and ultimate indifference to the fate of their own people. One criticism is that perhaps the movie was a bit too long: most of the scenes involving the bald doctor in the hospital or the child soldiers could have been cut and the movie would have been better. Of course, by now the movie is well known by the hundreds (if not thousands) of parody videos in the Internet where the original audio is retained but the subtitles are changed so that Hitler and his aides end up arguing about a lot of ridiculous and anachronistic subjects (like computer programs, sport teams, pop stars, whatever). Those videos are sometimes very funny (and they have been surprisingly resilient in time given the short attention span of fads in the web), but if the movie on which they are based was not powerful, they couldn't have thrived as they did.",
372,21 May 2012,oliverrhodesdopeypandas,10, Outstanding reconstruction of the Third Reich,"First thing, Bruno Ganz's performance is just the most realistic and only performance that is just like the real Hitler. Everyone in that entire movie, looked so much like their real-life version in the film. Movies like this that focus on making it realistic and accurate as possible seems impossible to do--but Downfall made it possible for any filming crew to search and want these pieces for making a brilliant movie. It also feels more authentic than the other movies about Hitler due to the natural German language. I'm actually glad there's no English dub as they usually would do for foreign language movies--I prefer subtitles over a dub! There are some things that are inaccurate. For instance, Fegelein was a Gruppenfuehrer in real-life during the last days, but in the movie he was a Brigadefuehrer. Those minor inaccuracies don't bother me, but if it's only I'm focusing on another character.",

Ganz played Adolf Hitler in the best way an actor can personalize someone, u will start thinking of him as the real Hitler..he speaks the very same way..he wakes and yells and even his hand shakes the same way..he deserved an Oscar for this amazing acting. one point i wanted to clear as we all heard how lots of ppl and newspapers and magazines rejected this movie...for that the movie shows a human side from Hitler...and thats very wrong coz Hitler was not human at all...for me i think the movie was VERY realistic..after all Hitler wasn't a vampire or a zombie feeding on dead bodies..this movie showed his human side which i believe it was very realistic..and his crazy insane obsessed side..which i also think it was realistic..so the movie didn't add or delete anything..it just dumped the truth in front of us..the truth as it has been told by an eye witness...Hitler's last secretary who died couple years ago. this movie deserves all the respect for the good making and for laying the truth as it is...10 out of 10",

The scenes of shelling and shooting on the streets of Berlin and the vivid display of wounds and amputations. Hitler's descent into disbelief that the war is lost, and that surrender is the only option are riveting. With the Soviet armies less than a mile away, Hitler orders non-existent troops to repulse the invaders with a pincer-movement.

A German production from the actors to the composing, this film holds back nothing and shows the events just as they unfolded. As an avid watcher of documentaries, I've actually compared the archive footage and film print, and to be honest at times the only difference of course is the clarity. Watching it all, I got the strange feeling that this was what the end of humanity would like: Optimists never truly giving in, a rain of fire from the sky, and the broken down idealists finally accepting their fate. The portrayal of Hitler here is just that; a broken man losing control. I wouldn't go so far as to call the film sympathetic to the Fuehrer, but it does portray him as a defeated visionary.

383,19 April 2015,bbewnylorac,8, Excellent film,"A very well made film that dares to present Hitler and those close to him in the dying days of the Third Reich as human. But it must be said, it's quite chilling to watch him dressing down his generals whose men are dying for Germany in the thousands, and criticising failed military moves of his own making, as his world literally falls down around him in the Berlin bunker. Also, when he's told that civilians including children are dying because he won't surrender or negotiate with the Allies, he doesn't care. The film effectively portrays the banality of evil, as Hitler lovingly strokes his dog, and as his girlfriend Eva Braun rather manically smiles her way through the crisis. It's strange to watch an impeccably groomed Magda Goebbels calmly poisoning her six sleeping children to death because she doesn't want them to live in a world without National Socialism. It's so surreal it's hard to believe it actually did happen in real life. The film also dares to present some of the generals, secretaries and senior Nazis as having compassion and emotions. I found that quite confronting. Special mention here to the searing intelligence and courage portrayed by Christian Berkel as the apparently good-hearted Professor Schenck who finds himself confronting rogue death squads and amputating limbs on the frontline in the dying hours. The film doesn't shirk from the utter bloodiness of the destruction of Berlin that Hitler is bringing down upon himself. The film is wrongly promoted as narrated by Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge, although it is based on her riveting book describing her time working for Hitler. In the film, Junge is very much a side character, and doesn't seem to do much, other than react with horror to what's going on. I guess the film's subject matter overwhelmed that angle.",

But after I finished watching it I believe that this could be one of the best and most honest war film I have ever seen. This is a German film about Hitlers last Days in the Berlin bunker. Unlike certain British and especially American films that take a moral high ground, this film is a brutally honest account of what happened without judging the morality of any of the characters, good or bad, it just tells the truth as best it can. The story gripped me from start to finish and at the end there is an important message for all who see it. This film also shows how ignorance can kill but if not stopped can do more damage than you could ever expect, for instance, Madga Gorbells kills her 6 children when she realises that the war is lost because she believes, wrongly, that a life after Nazism is no life to live. After this she and her husband both kill themselves. Also Hitlers secretary shows us that no matter how naive you are that is never an excuse not to find out what evil others are doing, even if done in secret. And this is the lesson that we must all learn. Just because we don't know about things does not give us an excuse to do nothing because we can always find a way to figure it out. And once we do that we can all stop the evil that is around us a little bit at a time.",

When you are watching scenes in the bunker, you feel a sense of claustrophobia with the bombs coming down on Berlin. Bruno Ganz is excellent as Hitler. He sees Hitler in a delusional fanatic convinced that the war can still be won and he will personally lead them to victory. The fact that most of his troops are dead or captured and entire armies have been destroyed does not seem to faze him. Anyone who does not fight to the death is a traitor and a coward to him. If he goes down, he thinks the entire German people should go down with him. You see this in the movie with a scene of boys 12-14 years old manning artillery guns, blinded by their loyalty to him. The film does an excellent job in showing how even toward the end, many Germans were blindly loyal to Hitler. They do want to see Germany after the fall of the Third Reich. They would rather commit suicide and even kill their own children to spare them the fall of the Third Reich. See this compelling movie, even though it is in German.",

Fair enough, this makes it all the more worrying, if he's human, we all are able to make the same horrific mistakes. Great acting performances by basically everyone. No problem there. But.... Hitler and Goebbels are the two rotten apples in the basket the movie seems to be telling us. And Goebbels (the brilliant intellectual who re-invented propaganda) is depicted as a loyal moron dog. Ein ""voll-idiot"" as they may say in German. The rest of the bunker crowd are either loyal but stupid, or realists who have cowardice as their biggest vice. The last ones are all depicted as people who want to talk some sense in this raving megalomaniac, as people who want to save the German population, but in the end were not able to stand up against big uncle Adolf. They meant so well after all.... To me, it came across as a feel-good movie, there were 2 madman (and a couple of loyal wives and secretaries), but the rest wasn't so bad after all, really. We can all go to bed safely now. Sure, a lot of Germans (most probably, in fact)were not responsible for the atrocities that went on, but to claim the same for the bunker crowd is stretching it. They too were human, bound to make mistakes, yes, but here most of them are almost angel material, cowardly angels, stupid angels, but nevertheless...........a sad, very sad story indeed....",
403,20 September 2005,arne-57,9," No monsters, but not my kind","One of the first movies to 'enlighten' us on what happened behind the curtains of the German high command. And to show their 'human' side and to try to portrait how they lived, how fanatic their devotion was to their fuhrer. In a way its refreshing because you feel it shows the truth... and the truth is so painful it took over 50 years before this movie could be made. I think this is one of the best 'anti' war movies ever made. Because it shows the failure of an 'absule' ideology, how following a man or an ideology blindly, can blind people from the Truth. Even when the Fuhrer himself can no longer see clearly.",

Hats off to Bruno Ganz - it was as if you really were watching Adolf Hitler , all other actors done a truly tremendous job that gave it that sick , dark , depressing feel !!! Although this film was given a label because it humanest Hitler - it didn't . It showed Hitler as the rest of us - YES , but it did not tear away from the point that Hitler was a monster and that it stuck true to . The tension in it was unbearable as you were waiting for the Russian army to invade . One of the best war time movies ever made and I believe personally it should be played in history lessons across the UK so the youth can be educated about the the true atrocities of The Third Reich . This film was far better than Hitler : The Rise Evil, a must watch for any film fan .",

The story is familiar enough to anyone who's been conscious at any time in the last 60 years. The story is sordid (about Hitler, Goebbels etc) and tragic(for Germany) with it. Junge's own contribution at the start of the film is very telling. Ganz's portrayal of an avuncular Hitler one minute and a raving delusional the next is a standout performance. The mood of the film is claustrophobic in the extreme, no doubt reflecting how oppressive that time in the bunker must have been for all concerned and the switches to what was happening above ground highlight the whole unreality of the bunker existence. I've since bought the DVD and have watched it again 3 times since. Ganz doesn't look much like Hitler(always excepting the moustache) but after a minute or two it doesn't matter. It makes me wish for an equally good film about Stalin- a subject crying out for screen work.",

I can't really add much more to other reviews (best WWII movie yet made, Bruno Ganz's performance, several moments of silence by the audience after the movie ended). The semi-documentary style, accretion of detail (right down to the labels on the canned food) and sound of Russian mortars put me in an ever-circling, claustrophobic milieu of despair and violence that I would hope to never experience. Just from an American perspective, the feel of it and the movement of the action (lots of corridors) reminded me of a weird, but amazing mix of Das Boot and a satanic episode of The West Wing.

This is a good outcome as I am sure that was the intent of the people who put this movie together. Sublime acting by the whole cast made it feel like you were in the bunker with Hitler for those last days. Some may need Prozac after watching this film as it does not have the typical Hollywood happy ending. Excellent history as the script attempts to stay close to the actual historical record as possible. Even though I am a historian of WWII, I still found things out in this movie that were new to me. Still, what sets this movie apart from other ""war flicks"" is the intense work by the actors to bring these characters to life and make them as multi-dimensional as their real-life counterparts must have been. These are not your cookie-cutter Nazis as seen in most war films. You still loathe and despise these people but you come to understand them a bit better. Hitler does not come off well as they portray his loss of touch with reality quite well. This was a man who almost conquered the world yet we see him beaten and broken and feeling betrayed by his loyal followers as well as the entire German people. You get to see some of the cost to the civilians of Berlin for Hitler's desire to see them pay for their failure to win the war. This movie does not glorify Hitler or the Third Reich rather it attempts to put those final days into a bit of perspective. A very tragic and horrific story but one that most Americans would benefit from seeing.",

The main actor Bruno Ganz is amazing as the maniacal Hitler coming to terms with the end of his dream.He looked almost identical to the real villain.

Schindler's List was one, Der Untergang is another. The story authentic in most parts, the performances awesome and the jingo stuff is low! Bruno Ganz made me believe that he is indeed the Fuhrer. One gets a glimpse into the man, his sick philosophy of life and his stubborn refusal to feel accept defeat. While the scenes where Hitler explains and justifies his actions frighten and anger you, the one in which Albert Speer says goodbye to him bring tears into your eyes. What a show by Bruna Ganz. The scene of his reaction to Himmler's betrayal is awesome! Whilst he execute Feigelein to extract revenge for Himmler's betrayal, he is considerate to Junge Traudl, even telling her ""I wish i could have given you a better present."", while giving the cyanide capsules. That is exactly what sets this movie apart. The authenticity and the cold presentation of facts! Maria Lara too deserves credit for being Junge Traudl.

Same for Ulrich Matthes as Goebbels, outstanding acting. You can really feel the atmosphere in the bunker and maybe understand deeds and actions that seemed unbelievable before.

I think everybody agrees that all of the actors, especially Bruno Ganz (Hitler), did an outstanding job, confusing the audience whether they are watching a documentary with real footage or a movie. A huge controversy goes on with the question whether some scenes depict Hitler as being too handsome and human or not - I would say that the intention of the director and his movie are pretty clear on this subject: Hitler, though a mass murderer and the personalized evil, was a human being. Ergo, one has to show every side of his character. While focusing its attention mainly on the clearly dominating destructive side of the führer, the movie doesn't neglect the other, calmer side of him that seduced many people as well as his historic speeches did.",

436,1 August 2006,gregopego12,8, It captures a great moral catastrophe well,"First of all, this movie was incredibly well made (and much better than Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List). I am examining these movies as to their usefulness as teaching tools about that period in history. You're better off with Band of Brothers than Saving Private Ryan. Schindler's list is probably easier to show to an American school audience, because their are lines delivered in English (weren't there?) Also, Schindler's List exposes the evil of Nazi Germany better than Downfall. Downfall. . .is all in German (with subtitles)--very hard for high school students to sit through, and is much more subtle in it's presentation of the evil of the Third Reich. That doesn't mean that the message isn't there (or clear), but the viewer needs a lot more background to the story to understand that this movie is not pro Nazi or pro Hitler. The movie's only shortcoming is that the historical players seem to wander in and out of the story for the first 45 minutes or so, but the movie certainly starts threading all of the pieces together. The actors do a great job, and the attention to detail is correctly used (not overused). This movie shows the chaos of Berlin, the military, and Hitler's Government shortly before they surrender to the Red Army. If one thinks that this movie is pro Nazi, he or she has to juxtapose the obvious displays of fanaticism for Hitler's cause with the obvious frustration of his General Staff (they're left in a drunken heap by the end of the story) along with the ruin of Berlin (with no concern for the civilians at all). Do not confuse an excellent performance of Hitler with a sympathetic performance. This is still the same monster who murdered millions of people and held on to impossible delusions until he surrendered to cowardice. Also, do not confuse the fact that 98% of the story is told through the German side as being sympathetic. When they finally confront the reality of Soviet occupation, they all react as cowardly as possible.",
437,19 March 2005,austindye91,10, History Noir,"""Springtime for Hitler"" was the droll marquee message for this film. ""Downfall"" is a minutely-detailed piece, with many scenes recreated from well-known photographs of that time. I believe the length was overlong (one glance at the watch), perhaps occasioned by its intensity and somberness. The simple fact that I was attentive for almost three hours to an unrelieved, predetermined outcome speaks to the excellence of the portrayals. No better fare for a film noir lover who seeks convincing that the plot could actually be real. There was no PC element, save the concluding interview with Frau Junge. I cannot understand the concerns of reviewers, who fretted that Hitler may be viewed sympathetically. Its historical accuracy transcends these concerns.

You actually believe Ganz is Hitler and the film's close attention to the monster as a human simply amplifies the deep rooted madness, the inhumanity, the cruelty of the man and thereby the underlying evil of the regime.

A Must See Film.,"Devastatingly realistic this ultimate film about the last days of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich, as seen through the eyes of his young secretary Traudl Junge, is a chilling but awesome experience rather than sheer entertainment. Bruno Ganz gives his finest performance as the crazed Dictator, who is more usually portrayed as either as a comic figure (Charles Chaplin) or a raving lunatic. Ganz brings depth and humanity to the character like never before, one minute compassionate to his staff, the next screaming retribution in some manic outburst. This is surely the definitive Hitler, probably as close to the true character as we'll ever get. His decent into despair and delusion is magnificently conveyed. A supporting cast of great strength gives added impact to the claustrophobic Bunker scenes, notably Ulrich Matthes (Joseph Goebbels) Corinna Harfouch (Magda Goebbels), Alexandra Maria Lara (Traudl Junge), and Juliane Kohler (Eva Braun). Perhaps the most disturbing sequence is when fanatical Magda Goebbels sets about poisoning her children, we the audience are never let off the hook by director Oliver Hirschbiegel. With superb photography recreating the grim effects of the war on Berlin, this is a standout film, all the more remarkable being made by a German film group. A must for those interested in one of the most horrific yet fascinating figures in recent history.",

Seen thru the eyes of Traudl Junge, (the real Traudl Junge has a scene at the opening and close of the movie) Hitler's secretary during the last 2 1/2 years of the Reich, we get to see first hand accounts of Hitler's world crashing down around him.

Hitler is depicted as an old broken but disciplined man, keeping distance to others. He behaves awkward when he kisses Eva, is almost patient and friendly against his female secretaries. When eating one of his last meals his hand is trembling. His manners are also stiff from his Parkinson disease. Hitler doesn't become a real human being, he stays at a certain distance, feeding the still present self created myth around his person. The public feels no sorry for this man which was also guilty of ordering the execution of mass war crimes. Apart from the leaders the normal personal bear no guilt and are victims themselves of the circumstances, like the main character Traudl Junge and the hundreds of thousands above the ground. The last days in the bunker passes self-evideny like a clockwork. Above the ground the storm of the battle rages and the area is heavily and constantly shelled by artillery and rocket fire. At the end of the movie Traudl Junge in her last years of her life admits that however she didn't know about the warcrimes she still feels guilty.",
449,4 February 2006,System_Error15,10, An excellent portrayal of Adolf Hitler's last days as the Fuhrer,"When I first picked this film up I have to admit I was not expecting such a captivating, well executed film. The film itself is based off of Hitler's last days in his bunker in Berlin. It accurately portrays what happens most of the time. You actually see Hitler physically deteriorating due to the immense weight of the news of his forces being repeatedly pushed back and the Russians surrounding him. He begins to delude himself into thinking that his generals are all out to usurp him from his power. Even to the last however he refuses to admit defeat and takes his own life. After that the situation in the Bunker turns to complete chaos, order is thrown to the winds and it is everyman to himself. The movie is told from one of Hitler's personal secretaries recollection. The actors chosen for this film are of very high quality and reenacted the situation as closely as could be done. The film is filled with emotion and it is clearly able to be seen the turmoil caused by Hitler's suicide on all the people surrounding him. Overall this film is a must see for the avid World War II film buff. The film also does an extremely good job in coming across neutrally and not trying to sway a person one way or the other.",
450,3 September 2005,NewInMunich,9," Every now and then, Germany gets out a movie that stands out","Films about Hitler are always in the dilemma of how to show this inconceivable character, as a crazy maniac, a hatred low level or what ever, risking to make him look human or to blow the chance of showing him as he possibly was. The film sticks reasonably with the credentials given by Traudl Junge, Hitlers private secretary and other eye witnesses of the final days of Hitler. There are two levels of story telling here, on the one side the strange, unreal isolated world of the ""Bunker"" into which Hitler retreats when the Russians are taking Berlin, and, on the other hand, the real life, well depicted in gripping battle scenes, army hospitals and interwoven to a no longer ""civil"" life of people being forced to arms or being hanged or becoming ""collateral damage"" in the fight. Confronted are the end time mood dominating Hitlers bandwagon of Generals, Party Leaders and other strange fellows surrounding him against the useless death of regular soldiers, Volkssturm people and Hitler Youth, with their fanatical will to turn the tide that finally rolls over them. Bruno Ganz, naturally, has the ""best"" role here, showing Hitler in a variety, from going berserk on bad news to being almost private as well as tangling himself and his entourage into phantasm of Army groups to relieve him, which have long ceased to exist as fighting units. Also impressive a long cast of German character actors, Corinna Harfouch as the mother taking the live of their 5 children, which shall not face a time without Hitler and National Socialism certainly standing out. Highly impressive, very well done to the small details, this movie can well hold up against any American Movie of the same budget both in quality as well as box office value.

On the one hand, it is undoubtedly a very well-directed and acted work of art, with an interesting and important story to tell; on the other, I felt an ambivalence - whether in the director, the actors, the story itself, I can't yet say - regarding the figures that were being portrayed. While the fallibility of Hitler, Eva Braun and the terrifying Goebbels family is immediately apparent (incidentally, I don't think I've ever seen a better and more frightening description of the dark side of motherhood than in Mrs Goebbels in this film), nevertheless I was left with a question mark: were these people really the savage misanthropes history has shown them to be, or idealists martyred to a cause they believed in, however misled? I think there is a danger in the film here, that it could be misused if it fell into the wrong hands. I was also somehow upset by some of the symbolism: the German 12-year-old who is able to destroy two enemy tanks, the drunk and disorderly Russian invaders. Are there fascist associations to this film? If so, are they consciously or unconsciously present? To what extent can a German director make a film of this sort responsibly? Eichinger certainly does a good job, but can he transcend his national origins?It may be useful, while watching it, to bear this question in mind. Nevertheless, a film worth watching.",

Hitler's personal psychological ruin , probably a delusional maniacal paranoia in the last stages , is incredibly portrayed by Mr. Ganz , as are all other characters , like the Himmler couple  the infanticide by madame Helga H . , otherwise the emblem of a true Arian mother , president of a Nazi women's association, immediately after their savior's suicide is , perhaps , one of the most shocking scenes in the history of cinema , then E. Braun , who at one point confides to the author , that in spite of having lived with Hitler for many years, she still does not know him , and all others as well .

477,30 January 2006,mplaza,10, This film's major contribution.,"To me, perhaps the main issue addressed by the movie is to what an extent an uncritical, no-questions-asked support of a leader not only by his people but by his close entourage and society's controlling institutions may go. That such an uncritical attitude and obsessional following or obeisance of any whims and decisions of a leader or ruler can -and in time, will- bring ruin and dissolution to a society (as it certainly did to one of the most cultured ones in the world) is the lesson all watchers of this movie must learn. And this will apply not only to Hitler (that he is not depicted or clichéd as having Jewish kids for breakfast is beside the point) but to any other leader or ruler in any country of the world. It may be argued that Hitler was no better or worse than other despots in 20th century history, call them Stalin,Pol Pot or Castro, as differences in their political and socio-cultural environments makes comparison of little pertinence, but what they all have in common is their blind acceptance and following by their peoples and the consequent debasing of their different countries' institutions and democratic checks and balances, which these rulers invariably nulled and voided, either by outright suppressing them or by putting them at their unquestioned service. A serious, dis-passioned and objective questioning of such a posture is perhaps the film's major contribution.",

Juliane Köhler was wonderful as Eva as well. It is quite a violent movie but I think in a movie like this it's needed.

It is also an ultimate success for Oliver Hirschbiegel. He deserves to be congratulated as a first class director. Of course there are a few words to add about Adolf Hitler. He had many crimes and sins of which he was aware.

The actors portray their roles fantastically, you believe you are seeing the real Hitler, Goebbels, etc. The film goes deep enough to allow you to understand the mindset of the characters, given the circumstances they are in. It does so in a manner which prevents you from slouching in your seat for even a moment of this film, which runs a good part of two and a half hours. It masterfully dances on a line, balancing the viewer on an emotional tightrope between sympathy and anger for the characters. The thing that was the most impressive was the fact that there was no Hollywood sub-plot, that we all too often see with major motion pictures.

Der Untergang has this problem. For the person who was slaughtered millions of innocent people, how can we see him doing things such as padding through a young boy's hair or putting a nervous secretary at ease with a joke? Luckily this is sort of kept under control with screenwriter Bernd Eichinger, who basically delivers that idea that even the worst of the Nazis were still human at heart, regardless of their intentions. The more interesting parts of the film is seeing Hitler not just picking out the Jews, but him and his cohorts going from picking out everyone, even to random Berliners who were considered traitors in Hitler's eyes. This film basically does delve in the fact that Hitler was long gone mad in his last final days.",

504,16 March 2011,hanvl,9, Incrediblle acting,"Story of this film evolves around the ending of the Second world word and is told but former Hitler secretary than twenty years old. Majority of the story takes place deep underground in the Hitler bunker. But it also shows fighting in streets and the fanaticism of some of the defenders, but also suffering of the normal people. The main story line is about Hitler and his incapacity to accept the inevitable, but there are number of smaller stories – of a SS doctor or a young Hitler Jungend boy. Those side stories are not bad but some of them are unnecessary and it seems to me that they have no proper bonding with the film. The film is gripping and good, but it would just normal good war movie if it weren't for Bruno Gang. His depiction of Hitler takes this film to the upper level and failure to even nominate him for Academy Award shows there is little credibility in them. He is just breathtaking, he really is Hitler. The speed in which he changes from a normal soft spoken guy to raving maniac is incredible. He plays Hitler with great strength and people can only think about how it is possible that this maniac could get to the country leadership. But this Hitler also has good sides, he is 3 dimensional and not flat caricature like in other movies. This makes him even more frightening because he is more human than ever.

505,23 May 2005,hedwards-4,10, Amazing,"I really enjoyed this film. The atmosphere in Hitler's bunker as Berlin fell all around it was reconstructed extremely well. The filmmakers did a brilliant job of recreating Berlin in the midst of battle. It actually felt like I was there. When we emerged from the darkened cinema my companions said that they felt as if they had just spent three hours in a bunker. The acting was amazing, particularly Bruno Ganz as an all-too human dictator and Corinna Harfouch with her chillingly calm performance as Magda Goebbels. I could not bring myself to watch as Frau Goebbels killed her children by placing cyanide capsules in their mouths and pushing their jaws together. It is such a shame that these German actors who are at least as talented as their Hollywood counterparts are confined to German language films. Some people have criticised Downfall for humanising Hitler but this was one of the reasons why it is a such a good and important film- we need to be reminded that there were people behind these terrible crimes, not monsters.

You would think at least the Germans could have gotten it right. One of the first glaring inaccuracies was the scene in which Hitler is in the garden of the Chancellery decorating Hitler Youth Boys with the Iron Coss. This event actually happened and was filmed by newsreel cameramen as portrayed in the film. However the even took place in the week before March 22, 1945, and not the day after Hitlers birthday. These are widely regarded as the last films made of Hitler. Strike 1! the HJ boy portrayed receiving the Iron Cross, was not actually from Berlin,and at that time the Russians were no where near Berlin. Strike 2! HJ Leader Artur Axmann was the HJ official at the sight, not some low ranking HJ official. Strike 3! So maybe I was expecting too much, but when I go to see a historic dramatization I at least hope they will stick to the facts. They do not. If you want to see a film based closer to reality see Anthony Hopkins award winning performance in The Bunker. If you know nothing of the truth of this story, hey it's a good little war film. If you are going expecting to see history as we know it come alive, you can forget it.Also the uniforms were among the worst I have ever seen in this kind of dramatization. The Bunker at least used an acknowledged expert, Brian L Davis, as a uniform consultant. These were the cheapest knock offs ever. Furthermore Hopkin's Hitler was far more convincing.",

The rest of the cast was spot on as well, as the sense of urgency in the ranks of the Nazi Party reaches fever pitch. Any Neo-Nazi would be well served to view this tale of their furor at his most feeble and deranged time, as they might begin to question why they follow such a leader.",

As he said so, his secretary looks to him (camera has a great view of her facial expression) as if he is crazy, as if she could not believe what he is saying. this is ridiculous: as if she wasn't an antisemit on her own ! but, why this ? the answer is simple: the book for the movie was created under the helping hand from this secretary. it is easy, eh ? Hitler was crazy (at the end (of his Reich)), and there were a lot of bad, but also a lot of good Nazis. and have a look at the end of the film: there is said that so and so millions of humans died in the WW2. and then, a new screen: so and so many Jews died . so: are Jews no humans, or what ? ... you should see the movie, and try to imagine if you would not known anything about this period of mankind: one could really have sympathy: For Adolf Hitler and his Nazis.",

520,7 March 2008,bunny_hater66,2, Come On Guys! Chaplin and Allen!,"I'm not that keen on the film there were sparks of promising moments but disappeared with suicide the only character that I did feel sorry for was the poor secretary being put through something that was probably an un-decided future working for a psychotic Jew hater. The narrative obviously had a subliminal message we are sorry for Hitler he weren't that bad. I just do not understand the great fascination and sympathy for a man that should have no respect for what he stands for which is rather hellish, I feel that they are trying to show that he isn't that bad but a normal human doing what any normal human is thinking and doing unfortunately for the Germans, Italians and Austrians I will not be fooled by pure trickery. But a common think that seems to be in the most recent of war films of foreign soldiers is suicide take for granted The Letters From Iwo Jima although that is a lot better and looks better. I was also anticipating something as good as Das Boot. But I did like a lot of the shots that made you feel quite moving and gripping like that young boy. What made this movie memorable to me were the scenes in which we could see the cruelty and sickening determination of some German officers and soldiers to fulfill their Führer's orders even when it was clear he had committed suicide. What I also liked was Bruno Ganz performance. I feel that it is just a flattering portrait of a evil regime and the devil himself. It shows quite a dark and profoundly horrifying ordeal of a death of there Fúrher and would go to any lengths to save there believes even dying with them. Probably the most eye opening and memorable scene is of when the mother killed her children showing that she feels that nothing is worth living if the Nazi's fall. And shows a kind of domino effect with one falling all the others do as well. It also showed that they were so dependant on him. . It shows that Hitler is visibally shrinking and shaking as he contemplates the third riech and almost alternating from despair and madness. Plus Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen are Jewish so I side with them two",

I think it is a good and realistic portrait of Adolf Hitler's last days, and all the madness that surrounded him. I utterly disagree with those who say this film gives a pro-Nazi vision. I have paid much attention more than two hours and I haven't found the slightest sign of Nazi Propaganda in this film. But I was willing to watch a film and what I found was a documentary. And I am not happy with that. The film didn't arose my interest at most points. Why? Mainly because it is too long, it's more of a documentary than a film, and doesn't add any interesting special feature to make it more interesting. I particularly don't feel any suspense during the film. What I am trying to say is that when you are doing a film about something people already know (most people know a lot about Hitler and particularly that he committed suicide)you have to add something to the film to make it interesting, or to add your personal view to an historical event. And none of these things have been done in the present film. Therefore, I see this film more as a boring documentary than as a film.",

I have seen a number of documentaries of the Third Reich, and watched archive footage of the Nazi leaders and I was fully convinced that I was seeing Hitler, Goebbels, Speer, Himmler, etc. as they were in the final throes of the thousand year Reich. I found myself crying when Blondi (Hitler's Alsatian) was poisoned, and when Magda Goebbels inserted the poison capsules into the mouths of her five children. I left the film with more tears, listening to Traudl Junge's closing statement. I actually felt sorry for the German people. Hitler had condemned them to death for he felt they had failed him.

The performances are Oscar worthy, the screenplay is exceptional, and the direction perfect. The tone of the film itself is dark, respectful, and introspective, as it should be. Yet there is a glimmer of hope for the innocent; the young, old, and civilians evidenced beyond all of the dictator-esquire digressions to provide the production additional value.

In the main role, he manages to follow all the lines the screenplay draws to him, varying from a decadent tyrant whose fits of anger sprout every minute, to a decaying Parkinson victim, to the gentleman that gained millions of Germans' trust with gentleman-ship. As faults, there is the awful lot of supporting roles that you barely remember at the end (the movie explains their destinies, but you can't recall what exactly they've done) and Alexandra Maria Lara's character, the uninteresting secretary of Hitler who never deserves the attention the film gives her - and Lara does little to make us like her. It was correct to show Hitler in all manners possible, because it leaves for viewers to decide when he makes sense and when he deserves the label of insane demon he has got.

I lived in Germany for 6 years and I it does not surprise me in the least that Hitler came to power to the degree that he did. This is not to say that modern Germany is full of fascist goose-stepping Nazis, but many modern Germans, even if they claim to be anti- Hitler/ fascist, still show a rather unsettling tendency to cherish the values that Hitler, the penultimate German, held so high. I speak here of the almost fanatical reverence for 'law and order', the territorialism that goes along with it, and the deep suspicion of all things foreign, all of which are well depicted in this film through the character of Hitler. Thus I think that this is a very educational film for most Germans because they have the opportunity to be reminded, lest they forget, of the devastating effects of xenophobia and intolerance.",

Of course, nothing changed and their exuberance was brief. (Perhaps they filmed such a scene and left it on the cutting room floor.) Second, the depiction of the bunker was so realistic that I had the feeling that the filmmakers had been given secret access to the real bunker. (After all, it still must exist, deep under Wilhemstrasse in Berlin, and will probably eventually become a tourist site, perhaps a hundred years from now.)",
545,6 April 2005,kathyandlarry,7, Very good but doesn't impact,Certainly well done as the actor playing Hitler really brought out his personality. For me the interest though was not in watching Hitler as the people around him struggle or accept the mess they are in. Maybe that is why the movie doesn't rise to great for me. The supporting case doesn't rise to a level that really makes one care about them or what is going to happen. This despite the makers attempting and I believe showing what it really was like in Berlin during those 10 days. I suppose knowing how it comes out in the end doesn't help any. Minor crit: I wish the movie had done a better job of identifying the names of the people around him.

The movie is made very realistically so the person seeing the movie has a chance to be very close to the whole situation going on in the bunker. The whole movie concentrates mostly on three people Hitler, his secretary and Ewa Braun, it tries to portrait each individual with his / hers feeling from the inside.

It tells you nothing, except that these people remain true to their principles until death. It tells you nothing about their crimes, it tells you nothing about their powers. It tells you only something about their characters, what nobody needs to know.

557,3 October 2006,janiharp-1,10, A Nation Awaits Its Downfall,"April 1945, all of Germany awaits its Downfall. Downfall is called dramatic and accurate by critics. It is a film based upon fact and seen through the eyes of young Traudi Junga, Hitler's secretary. What the audience sees is the everyday lives of Adolph Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun, amongst those that surround them in that infamous bunker during the final days. Hitler, with his many faults, appears almost human. A superb acting feat by Bruno Ganz, I am sure. The Russians invade Germany and bombard Berlin with artillery as the Russian Army circles the city. The bunker becomes an execution chamber for Hitler and his close advisors. The facts were horrifying. Many took their own lives out of fear of the approaching ferocious Russian Army. Nothing was more cruel than to watch Frau Goebbels kill her children as she cries over the loss of National Socialism. The film is filled with characters from the past and Ms. Traudi Junga tells her story with her own words. ""I must try (to survive)"", Traudi tells her friend as they are separated. At the end, Traudi tells the world that she did not know how bad things really were or the extent of the damage. Fifty million people died before the war was over. It is a story that needs to be told. At the end, the names and titles are shown of the ones that were there, along with a brief history of what happened to them. I mention this because I think it is important to note that some did survive. The language is German with subtitles in English.

The construction of the film is amazing it attempts to cover huge ground in the space available to it pulling together threads which include: the impact of the final days on ordinary citizens, the organisation and hierarchy surrounding the fuhrer, a depiction of Hitler that goes beyond caricature and a real sense of the 'dream' of the third Reich finally folding into a nightmare. Performances all round were excellent. There is depth and intelligence at work here..do not let it pass you by. I would add a word of caution that the scene depicting the deaths of the Geobbals children is truly harrowing and has stayed with me for weeks.",

I believe you should watch this film yourself to fully enjoy it and understand it because, to me, words can't describe the effect of this film and how moving it really is. It is also more authentic because it is in German and all the props and costumes are excellent! The acting is also wonderful and, in my opinion, is a must-see for any WWII enthusiast!",

The actors do magnificent portrayals of Hitler and his adjutants, not only showing you the horrors that they have committed, but the fact that they were people too, not just a stereotypical bad guy tying a girl to a train track. Bruno Ganz does a wonderful job at being Hitler, his compelling performance made you understand what it was that had so many people enthralled with the man, his charisma, his energy, and how he managed to make everything seem as though it were in control, even though the Russians were mere kilometers from the city center in the beginning of the movie. Ganz also shows the darker side of Hitler, his absurd ideals, his unreasonable strategies, and how mentally unstable he was by the end of the war. The film undoubtedly is dark, showing you over ten suicides, including those of mere children in the Hitler Youth, a girl a few years older than myself, perhaps 16, and a boy around 17. You also see the Hitlers', the Goebbles', their children's, and several lieutenants' suicides. The Downfall shows the chaos that ensued during and after the fall of the Reich, SS squads killing people who they had deemed traitors, those who had allegedly helped the Russians, and the horror of the war in itself. Traudle Junge's part and the young Hitler Youth boy, Peter, tend to be overshadowed by Hitler and his adjutants, but they do play a fairly large part.

Shirer and ""Inside the Third Reich"" by Albert Speer to name a few, as well as majoring in History, I can attest that this film is THE most unbelievably accurate portrayal of the Third Reich's final days we are ever likely to see, and since most of the first hand observers are dead or in their final days it is very unlikely that any subsequent film will surpass this one. Time has a way of bending history to sway public opinion and suit current needs, and the more time passes, the more embellishments and subjective opinion can be inserted to distort true facts.",

If anything the editors didn't leave enough on the cutting room floor but it's still a very tight film. The political courage to make this film also deserves some credit; Germany and the world are well served by a movie that shows the demonic charisma of one man and how so many are susceptible to that kind of power.",

Bruno Ganz's performance was spot on from the books written by/about those closest to him, especially his surviving secretary, Traudl Junge. Mr. Ganz vividly portrayed a manipulative monster, one who is very charming and warm when one-on-one with him, who loved dogs, children, and pretty secretaries, yet had a soul of evil that plotted and implemented the extermination of millions of innocent people and started a war that claimed tens of millions more. Christian Berkel is fascinating as the SS doctor trying to save the lives of as many people as he can from the Communist hoards sweeping in to Berlin.

584,5 April 2005,ksp-8,10, The movie is about Hitler's last days in his bunker in Berlin!,"This movie is one of the best war movies of all time. It shows the situation in the Fürherbunker in 1945 and the final days of Hitler. Bruno Ganz has the important role of ReichsFürher Adolf Hitler, and he does it greatly, he is excellent as Hitler! This movie is not only the best German film I have ever seen, but it is also the best movie over all that I have seen! There are many actors portraying all the people that were with Hitler in the Fürherbunker when he committed suicide, and all of those actors get the characters they are playing so really well. The movie is based mostly on the story of Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge. Finally Germans, you have done a movie to be proud of! Bravo!",
585,24 February 2010,outerspace-4,9, Very impressive and outstanding cast,"When I saw this film, I was very impressed by the role of Bruno Ganz playing Adolf Hitler. I think they're not many people who would like to play one of the most insane dictators of human history. But Bruno Ganz did a great job doing so. He played his role so convincing you might think Hitler was exactly like that. He was not just mad and insane all the time, but also showed human traits so now and then. To the end, the film becomes more and more dramatic and really gives you the feeling you are inside that bunker as an invisible spectator. You're experiencing the last desperate moments of Hitler and his military leaders finally resulting in their suicide. One of the scenes which struck me most, was the one in which Hitler thanked the Hitler-Jugend for their bravery and effort. I recently saw the original footage and it showed great accuracy and similarity with the film. Some believe this film is a tribute to the Nazis or a 'Hitler-glorification' which I myself fully disagree. This film simply shows the facts whether we like it or not but is at the same time very instructive.",

I left the cinema with a feeling stunned at what i had just seen, if ever there was a film to show the madness of Hitler and the absolute Armaggedon that National Socilaism brought to Germany, then this is it.",
587,11 October 2005,mcv905,9, A history lesson to be watched,"An outstanding movie. It was a little slow getting into it but ending up being a fast paced, action packed adventure into the mind of a mad man. Watching this movie and not knowing the history of Hitler and World War 2 you almost feel sorry for the guy. But to the families of the millions of people he ordered murdered, there is no sorrow for him. I found this movie very educational. It should be shown to high school students in all history classes. It starts by showing Hitler with a human side, then moves him to his delusional state that eventual shows him as a psychotic killer. The acting captured the mood when Hitler felt that his armies were coming to recapture Berlin and make everything right for, knowing very well that his armies were being defeated and there was no rescue. The way it was portrayed how Hitler turned on his biggest supporters when they realized all was lost and surrendered was bone chilling. His marriage to Eva Braun, a woman as nutty as he was, was also bone chilling on someone could love a man like Adolph Hitler. They both got what they deserve in the end although there still is doubt that they killed themselves and were burned. I still have beliefs that Hitler and Eva lived there lives out in Argentina, but I guess that story is for another movie. As long as you can stand the sub titles, I highly recommend this movie so that everyone can learn how this man nearly took over the world and maybe they will get an idea on how many other tyrants are out there is the modern world today.",
588,11 March 2005,floetry,9, mixed emotions,"I just finished the movie at the moment and I think that I understand my anchestors better. Those who didn't believe Hitler lived in fear and those who believed had no sense for reality, where mislead or where on a pursuit for love, family and a better life without knowing what war really does. ""Untergang"" displayed psychopaths at it's best. Bruno Ganz (who played Goethes Faust in a 22 hour stageplay), one of the most variable actors of our time, played a perfect Hitler, as we know him from audio/visual documents. He even imitated his voice, walk and mimic frighteningly perfect. This movie is quite dangerous for less educated people, because it could be misunderstood. For all those guys there should be a fictitious sequel named ""Hitler vs. Ghandi"". And Ghandi finally wins. Of course he won before the struggle even begun ...people know why ... :-)",
589,7 April 2005,bobby-connolly,3, Cannot see what seems to be so compelling about Down Fall,"Went to see Down Fall because I heard Bruno Ganz was worth seeing. He was worth seeing. But after the sixth or seventh of his scenes I found his role and his portrayal of Hitler uninteresting. The movie was not worth watching; though I suppose if you wanted a synopsis of what went on in the bunker the story covers a lot of ground. I left the theater after the sound of the shot. We are led to believe that Hitler has shot himself. Main gripes: Too long, Cheap looking locations, Too many characters (OK so there were a lot of people who wanted Hitler to surrender, to leave, to try and lessen the horror of Berlin's citizens) I couldn't see the purpose of recounting each one, This looked liked what it was; a made for TV movie. We get a glimpse of one viewpoint. The newly wed Eva Braun tries to suggest that maybe Hitler was of two distinct persona. The man versus the leader of the National Socialists. But that or any sort of real explanation for the different moods Ganz portrays are not developed.",

He's become more caring than his real counterpart, the most notorious human being ever. I can see that he loves his dog and wife better than his real counterpart did. I might as well consider this Hitler to be very humane compared to the real Adolf Hitler. He can still be angry, quite so. But his anger is more fun to experience too. By the way, I may enjoy his anger.Many of the scenes are very well put together and notable. The movie has also given a lot of character to Nazis. They have lovable quirks and are useful in a pinch.

Seeing through the enemies eyes, knowing things you don't read about in history books. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who does not know general facts about world war two, clearly meant for Germany a nation that realizes what it had done and has deep knowledge of the happening. If one does not know the evil of Hitler then the movie might stretch them to support him over an anonymous, ruthless opponent. This is not to say that the movie says Hitler is good, but it shows how ruthless of a leader he was without having to bring up the Jewish part of the holocaust. truly makes Hitler seem like an evil maniacal man obsessed and overcome with power.",

The film shows Hitler in the lowest possible level although he is hated all over the world you begin to feel sorry for him because he is seen for what he truly is a human being. The characters in the film are also brought down to Hitlers level. The other become more desperate because they feel that Germany will crumble when isn't in power, they feel there is no future if Hitler doesn't rule over Germany.

That was before a year or so and I'm still searching for the sense of this film. Well, I think I have to surrender. What's the sense to show the last hours of the worlds greatest tyrant who killed millions of human beings?? This film gives you the intention that the allies were the bad guys. What's the sense to make a film which intention obviously is to have pity on Adolf Hitler. So, what happened? Of course, children who don't know much about history yet feel sorry for him. I heard a little girl say: ""Mum, why does everyone hate him? I think he's nice"". I was close to puking when I heard that, but I couldn't accuse her. I would have thought of it the same way, when I was child.",
600,2 March 2006,skyluck,9," Best ""Hitler's Bunker"" version ever!","As a WWII history buff, I have seen numerous ""Hitler's bunkers"" flicks over the past 20 years growing up in Europe (and there are too many too list---American, Brit, German, and of course Soviet!) but this has to be by far the best adapted, most accurate versions of them all. One of the qualities that makes this historical gem stands out from the rest is its objective approach, presenting the nitty-gritty realities and chaos of WWII Berlin at the end of the war, portraying the Germans both as aggressors and victims with minimal politically-correctness ""pins."" Another exemplary feature of the film is its historical accuracy---from the war torn settings (bomb-out Reichchancellory, bunker, SS murdering rampages) to the relatively accurate plot to the authentic characters. Bruno Ganz's---had he been a Gringo, he'd have received Oscar nod for sure--- depiction of the Austrian ""little corporal"" (Hitler's generals reference to him behind his back) is the best I have seen to date, from Furher's megalomaniac mood swings to his delusions of grandeur and insidious evil magnetism. Beside the underlying psychological makeups of the characters, I particularly like the peripheral though informative elements of the film, such as images of widespread destructions of Berlin streets and the desperation of its inhabitants, the omnipresent terror and indiscriminant butchering of the innocents by Nazis zealots even as the ""curtain falls."" For a major motion pic, it did not spin or play to conventional beliefs as other big flicks have a tendency to do in order to appeal to mass consumption rather than historical accuracy. With a few exceptions, the movie follows many of the events surrounding Hitler circle quite accurately compared to other ""insider"" accounts (such as Traudl and Speer memoirs) of this fascinating history. There are a few historical divergences (i.e. most ""bunker"" flicks have the Goebbels asking one of the SS officers for help instead of doing it themselves at the end); however, these are minor lapses. Other than that, this realistic war drama will definitely be ranked along side other recent WWII treasures such as Schindler's List and Das Boot.",
601,12 October 2006,jberenyi,10, A wonderfully done piece of history noting the last days of Hitler,A very moving and at times disturbing account of Hitler and his cronies during the last days of the war. Especially riveting is the scene where Goebel's wife kills her own children. To see this dramatized is horrific. A must see movie. The movie I believe accurately portrays both the feeling of what happened and the psychology of what went on in these people's minds. This movie helped explain a few things about this time in period but also helped answer some questions I always had about the last days in Hitler's bunker. Make note that the very beginning of this movie has a brief clip of one of Hitler's secretaries before her death in 2002. It is her account and memoirs that helped make this movie. And to her I say thanks!,

Denial is a potent but essential drug of fanatics. One is impressed with Hitler's conviction and tenacity of his beliefs in his maniacal fantasies, delusional at the end. However, the madness continues. Compassion for the German people, who chose their leaders, is misplaced. They deserve what they get. Traitors are executed even though the war is nearly ended. Troops and officers get drunk, party with cocaine and alcohol, only to be arrested and shot just before the Russians overrun Berlin. Yet no one wants to live in a world without National Socialism.

I was so sorry that I didn't leave the cinema during the break when I went to this movie. I was just waiting the whole movie for something interesting or amusing to happen, what never happened. Maybe a good moral or something could have made up for that, but that also was something the movie lacked. Plot line of the movie; a few bombs, a few sick and crazy Hitler fans, a bunch of people who didn't dare to speak up to Hitler and Hitler being boring and disturbed. Boring dialogs and even 'so-called-dramatic-events' came off pretty lame.",

The cast are really great. These are mostly German stars, some not very famous, but they perform wonderfully. Bruno Ganz shows Hitler as he probably really was. The film is criticized because it gives the Nazi's a human face, but this is exactly it's strongest point the Nazi's were not extraterrestrial monsters, they were as human as you and I. It was very brave to make this film, given that controversy was almost certain to arise. One of the highlights of this year, to be sure. If you are interested in how it really was, go see it in the cinema, it's worth every penny.",
617,12 September 2005,tjlange1,9, Must see!,"Downfall is one of the best World War II movies that I have ever seen. I like the fact that Downfall lets the viewer decide about the evilness of the characters by presenting them in a multi-dimensional manner. The way in which the characters are presented forces the viewer to analyze the motives and question themselves what others would do in a similar situation. The picture did an excellent job of showing the different types of followers, from the opportunistic, to those with a semblance of a conscience, to the blind devotee. Just an awesome portrayal of the conditions in Berlin at the war's end. The depth and complexity of the characters in the movie make this picture a must see for any movie lover.",

620,24 August 2005,danfcon,10, a few hidden agendas among the ruins of the third Reich,"A great movie: a superb vehicle for recounting the History of the end of Nazi Germany through the eyes of one of Hitler's secretaries, but take it with a few grains of salt. The producers described as History a number of THEORIES concerning the end of the Nazis. The doctor who mixed the knockout drug Finodin that Magda Goebbles gave to her children before killing them was named by the producers as Stumpfnegger, who committed suicide with Bormann. However, much evidence, including a deposition I have personally read in the US National Archives in College Park MD, names someone else (who denied involvement). Herman Fegelein is shown as having been arrested drunk in a hotel room (the Adlon?) and shot for desertion, though he was actually hanged for espionage, a much more involved and interesting albeit detracting story. Eva Braun, portrayed for the first time NOT as a cardboard character, when confronted with evidence of Fegelein's espionage, in fact supported the execution, but this was not portrayed. However, what the producers got right compensates for these nagging errors. A great touch was denying any lines to the evil debauched parasite Goering. Goebbles, Hasse, Shenk, Moenhke, Burgdorf, Krebs, and Weidling were portrayed masterfully. Even Bormann was portrayed as forgettable background furniture, a skilled ironic touch. The most successful technique: The set design often reproduced in exacting detail famous stills taken during the fall of Berlin. I often caught myself thinking, ""I remember that,"" though I was never there.",

We all had to hold ourselves back from leaving early from the film. We only decided to stay to see if there was a great ending, but no. The acting was so terrible. I mean just awful and my German friends couldn't agree more. There were random scenes that had nothing to do with the film and they were boring too, which just added to the length of this nightmare. I was surfing through IMDb and came across the ratings and comments for this movie and couldn't believe how highly this film was voted. I immediately called my German friend who was dumbfounded as well. Someone even wrote that this was the best World War II film ever made! Give me a break. Saving Private Ryan will sweep mops the floor with Der Untergang. Don't waste your time or money on this film.",
623,28 August 2005,cbduncan,8, The End of a true life horror of dictation,"DOWNFALL is very well produced, and is truly the depiction behind the secretary of the greatest feared dictator in the 20th century. This film is graphic and surreal in its ability to depict the awful dilemma that faced the German people as they plead their allegiance to the 3rd Reich, and faced the loss of their own personal lives for the sake of it's leader. This film also show the believed nature and psyche of Adolf Hitler and his lack to care even for his own followers. The film shows the tragedies of the results that ended the Germans in their battle of WWII. The film is harsh in its graphics, and yet real to show the hazards of allegiance to a mentally unhealthy ruler. A great film to depict another view of our world history in WWII. A film that can also teach lessons for people now to consider the gravity involved in following a group not allowing compromise in its position.",

With the film being in subtitled German it gave it an air of authenticity (as far as a film documentary can be) that I enjoyed. Yes, it humanised Hitler and those around him but on the flip side it made the situation they were in and the things they did in their final hour all the more horrifying, particularly the systematic killing of the goebbels children by their own mother. In all a great film for those who are interested in WW2 history I'd give it a 9 but for Everyone Else it's a 8 or possibly a 7 since it did drag, even for me, in places.",
626,20 February 2006,tony1911,10," Excellent movie, but supporting characters seemed to be merely sketches.","I first saw Downfall at an art house in Scottsdale. Wanting to be able to see it without the usual American movie accompaniment of gallon buckets of soda and garbage can-sized popcorn, I opted for the early, midday show. To my amazement, the place was packed! Still, to their credit, they were a very quiet and appreciative audience. The movie itself was brilliant, although the supporting cast bore no resemblance to the originals. Joseph Goebbels was small, and was known as the 'Poison Dwarf', but was played by a very tall German actor. Now, to my beef. I'm a writer (2 novels, 1 non-fiction book, many magazine articles), and I'm looking for information on Herman Fegelein, the Waffen-SS general who was married to Gretl Braun, Eva's sister. He was shot in the garden outside the bunker. I'd like to have seen more of this character, especially as he was seen in his apartment getting ready to leave town! Maybe if a 'director's cut' DVD is going to be released, we'll see more of this character.",

630,30 June 2013,Davidpor,9, A masterpiece,"This is the greatest WW2/Hitler based movie I have ever seen. Bruno Ganz is excellent as Adolf Hitler. In fact all the cast are great and so believable in their parts. I was completely taken in by the story and found the retelling of Hitler's final days enthralling. The fact that it was subtitled was a thought that annoyed me before I sat down to watch this masterpiece. However shortly into the movie I had almost forgotten they were there and regretted not giving this piece a chance sooner. I was glued to the screen all the way through. If only more movies were made as great as this one, with less Hollywood and more realistic feel.",

Based on the accounts of Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge, Downfall unflinchingly depicts the end of the Nazi leader's life prior to the German surrender during World War II. Lead actor Bruno Ganz is easily the highlight of the film—he manages to be both captivating and frightening in his portrayal of a desperate Adolf Hitler. The rest of the cast performs admirably as well. They really draw you into the events of the film with universally believable performances.",

633,22 March 2012,lbaseball,9, Very Well done,"Der Untergang, or The Downnfall, was a very well scripted and depicted movie about the events that took place in Hitler's Berlin Bunker. The story is made better by the perspective from which it is told. It is about a young lady who becomes Hitler's secretary and how she views the events in the final days of the Third Reich. It is a very compelling and emotional movie but is not for the faint of heart as the movie can be graphic at times but aside from the grotesque scenes, the movie is fantastic.",
634,17 February 2006,animax1,10, Fiction vs. Reality,"Nobody knows what exactly happened in Berlin in 1945; this is fiction. The documentary stance is better than for example Hollywood's interpretation of Hiroshima & Nagasaki. One must always look at a movie in terms of profit-driven intent. No movie is a true documentary. European movies and all other industries have been suffering since 1945, and they will continue to do so for another 100 years or so... Except Great Britain and Switzerland, of course (they are shareholders in Hollywood media). We do not care about Monaco or Luxembourg, for now. When will there be real freedom of the press (the press includes international movie distribution). What if someone will make a movie that will show WW1 & WW2 from another point of view, and he or she will publicize it as fiction? That would have to be upheld as constitutional in a supreme court within the EU (let us not deal with the corruption of US courts that is, at least for now, is not substantial in the EU, but it shall come shortly). So, in our view, history books published after 1945 are propaganda, nothing more, nothing less.",

The White Rose is a movie about them. The downfall is captivating, showing how human beings can become so entangled in ideology that will make them do things you would never think of doing in your right mind. But how horrible it must have been for Bruno Ganz to decide to play Hitler! Yes, the National-socialists are all human beings, showing them as alien monsters does not help understanding how WWII and the concentration camps came about...",
636,12 March 2005,rrc3813,10, My God...,"This is one of the finest renditions I have ever seen of the other side of World War II; and everything in it is very accurate, I was surprised by how the filmmakers did not shy away from some of the more powerful moments, such as Magda Goebbels poisoning her children, or Hitler testing the poison on Blondi. All that DID happen, and Hitler really was that erratic in the Bunker; read the standard books on the subject,and you'll find that this Hitler's performance matches exactly that of the real one who committed suicide in 1945.",

638,19 April 2005,seangimbel,9, Very accurate,"Being a history student and someone who has read a lot about WWII, this movie struck be as being very accurate. I think Ganz's depiction of Hitler is quick remarkable. Portraying the definition of evil while at the same time showing other emotions must have been quite a challenge. The directors choice of someone 10 years older than Hitler was at the time was also interesting. Also, both the Goebbles were chilling P.S. I did not find that the Nazi's were in anyway glorified or justified. The fact he did not give them horns or a pitch-fork tail does not lessen the message that Hirschbiegel wanted to deliver. The Nazi's were human, and they came from human conditions.",
639,26 April 2005,p-spence,10, Did you feel emotional after viewing 'the passion of the Christ'? if you did then you may experience a similar experience after watching downfall 1,"In my opinion 'Downfall' visually complements two books I have read on the last days of the 'Third Reich'. The authors being Joachim Fest and Albert Spier. As far as I recall, all details in the film are same as the descriptions contained within the books from the authors, in other words the film conforms to the accuracies portrayed in the books. The film portrays the last days of Hitler and his confidantes, who retreated to the Berlin 'bunker'to avoid shelling from the Red Army. The film manages to capture within the bunker the bleakness, the hellhole, and the madness that much of the Nazi topbrass experienced toward the end. If you know your WWII history and the enigma of Hitler, his idealism, his imperialistic ambitions then you will be able to sense the absolute madness and emotions he and his entourage people were feeling. What is that old saying .....'the higher you fly the harder you fall' ? Compelling",
640,27 December 2005,alqasimk,10, Awesome.,Honestly I have to say that this is the 1st movie I ever say to summarize Hitler's last days. I know that there are several movies like The Bunker for Anthony Hopkins but I never saw that. The movie was so realistic as If your living really the last few days with Hitler's and his men on their Bunker. Alexandra Maria Lara (as Traudl Junge) was so attractive and did a perfect performance as Hitler's secretary! if you are interested on knowing more about this you can check out the Documentary Blind Spot - Hitler's Secretary which is well informative. Also Bruno Ganz (as Hitler) adopted Hitler's character as if he was Hitler!! you cant believe this until you see some documentaries about Hitler's era. This movie is really one of the best foreign movies I ever saw and and no wonder it was nominated for an Oscar as the best foreign movie. I heard also that this is the 1st German movie regarding Hitler and the end of the Third Reich. weired! what they were waiting for!,
641,30 August 2005,louwp,10, Probably the best movie I've seen the last 10 years,"Probably the best movie I've seen the last 10 years. The casting is superb, the acting is honest and shaking. Take into considering that the movie is German, touching deep into national soul and regret. The storyteller (a young personal secretary for Adoph Hitler) is probably not always the best witness seen from a historical point of view and some scenes therefore not exact documentally (i.e. partly fiction) such as the Mrs. Göring killing of her own children - in fact one of the most shaking parts. The fall of Hitler as a person is portrayed with excellent force. See the film. It is worth it - but see it in a theater with a large screen. It deserves it.",

I like this movie because is the pure reality of the Third Reich, with persons like Adolf Hitler, Eva Braun, and all the generals... I'll recommend for 15 ages over. In this movie we see the final hours of the most powerful man on history, the bunker and all of Berlin looks so real, there is explosions, bullets, gun fire, and the most interesting in this film is the suicide of the Fürher, before this I remember like a myth, but this film is based in the book of Traudl Jungle, she was a secretary of Hitler and before she die, she write the book of ""Until the final hour""... This movie is excellent is like a classic film",
647,22 March 2006,mau_ner,10, Masterpiece,"This film is the most powerful I have ever seen, a compelling vision of an episode in history that has always fascinated me. Adolf Hitler (supremely realised by Bruno Ganz), the archetype of evil, liberated from stereotype, is made human, sympathetic even. Stripped of his diabolic rhetoric from the podium, he becomes an introspective shadow of his former self, moving from incandescent rage to utter despair, vainly clutching to a delusional hope of final victory. Downfall also has a surrealistic element. Utterly despondent people whose Dream literally crumbles around them are seen partying with the Red Army knocking at the door. Innocent children, oblivious to their bleak future, sweetly serenade their elders in the claustrophobic bunker. For me, this is as close a vision of hell that has ever been committed to film, as Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge says, ""It's like a dream but I can't wake up.",
