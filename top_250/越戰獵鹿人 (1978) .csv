0,6 April 2006,yawn-2,10, It was 1978 and everyone in the audience was about to wet their pants,"No, this is not the best film about the Vietnam War; it's hardly about Vietnam at all. The vets who don't like it have it wrong, as do the Vietnamese who found it racist. It could be any war, with any combatants. But because the (primary) victims here are recognizable American archetypes, Americans will feel this in their gut more than any other war film I know of. This is one of the very few post-war Hollywood films that shows a sincere reverence for the lives of small town Americans.",/

2,31 January 2010,abelardo64,10, A War Like All Wars A Film Like No Other,"""The Deer Hunter"" is 32 years old. How extraordinary to sit through it now. Walking over the politics that divided , somehow, all of its admirers then. ""Great film but..."" How silly to think of it now. Michael (a sensational young Robert De Niro) is as extreme a character as Rocco was in ""Rocco And His Brothers"" His goodness, the one that was always there but that he discovers under the most horrendous circumstances, underlined by Stanley Mayers's ""Cavatina"" permeates the entire film. I remember thinking, when I saw the film for the first time, that I couldn't or wouldn't spend ten minutes with Michael and his friends, the ones we meet at the beginning of the film but by the end I thought of them as brothers and I loved them. I actually loved them. That in itself is a sort of film miracle. John Savage will break your heart, it certainly broke mine and Christopher Walken is absolutely riveting. How strange to tho think that Michael Cimino, still a young man, is nowhere to be seen. Is still a punishment for ""Heaven's Gate"" and ""Indecent Exposure"" or there is something else we don't know about. The Cimino behind ""The Deer Hunter"" is a true master.",e

4,18 October 2017,gab-14712,9, Hard to Watch At Times!,"1978's The Deer Hunter is one of the more polarizing movies to come out during the 1970's. It was the first movie with the deeply controversial subject of the Vietnam War to both become a critical and commercial success. However, there were several people who expressed dissent ranging from its portrayal of the Vietnam War to the controversial involvement of Russian roulette to the singing of ""God Bless America."" I remember not being too impressed with the film the first time I viewed it. I felt it was too long and violent. Years later, I am singing a different tune. It's a difficult film to sit through because of its violence and the effects of PTSD (post-trauma syndrome). But it is a highly engaging and effective film and I regard it as one of the more influential American movies of the 1970's. Not the best, but the most influential because there will be more successful films tackling the Vietnam War on the horizon.",i

7,18 January 2004,movieguy1021,10, The Deer Hunter: 10/10,"Most young people today need to learn that Robert De Niro was not just  the person in Meet the Parents or The Adventures of Rocky and  Bullwinkle, but he starred in films like The Deer Hunter, which got him  to where he is today. Not only is he a great actor, he always picks  good films to act in. And with a strong supporting cast, also, you  can't really go wrong with The Deer Hunter.  Michael (De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken), and Steven (John Savage)  sign up to go to Vietnam. They leave after a farewell party/wedding  party for Stanley and Angela (Rutanya Alda). Once in the  midst of the war, they are forced into playing Russian Roulette and  eventually they escape, but none of them can forget the experiences  from the war.  It's sad to see that Michael Cimino fade from view, because his  direction here is really memorable and it's what holds the film  together. There's about 70 minutes in the beginning of the film that  has nothing to do with the rest of the film, but it gets us to know  these three main characters, and it seems like you wouldn't care if  they even went to Vietnam, because you certainly were intrigued by  these three people. And once they're in the perils of war, you feel  enough for these three basic people to get through the war.  The Russian Roulette scenes are harrowing, even when it's a complete  stranger who has the gun to their head. I read that to get the tension  on set, a live bullet was put into the gun, but it was checked to make  sure that it wasn't the one about to be shot. And, since you've known  these people for 90 minutes already, you obviously didn't want them to  die, making them all the more nervous.  The Deer Hunter is quite unlike another great Vietnam film, Full Metal  Jacket. While FMJ just showed the immediate results, this movie showed  the results immediately and in the future, back at home. This helped  make everything seem more realistic, which it was. For each of the  three main characters, the war has changed them greatly, and none for  the better.  De Niro is great, but the stand out here is Walken, who accurately  takes his role and makes it into something memorable. Thankfully, he  won best supporting actor. Meryl Streep was nominated as a supporting  character, deservedly. However, this movie is not all about the acting,  it's about the feeling you get. As one character says, 'I don't know  how I feel.' That's exactly how you'll feel after seeing this  tour-de-force.  My rating: 10/10  Rated R for strong language and violence.",/
8,25 April 2021,ofumalow,6," Devastating at the time, uneven and problematic now","I hadn't seen this movie since it came out 43 years ago, at which point it seemed overwhelming--not perfect, just overwhelming in its scope and intensity. Of course, I was only 17 then, most of the actors were very new to audiences, and much of the content seemed groundbreaking as well as shocking. Seeing it all this time later, inevitably the credibility of the leads as ""ordinary steeltown folk"" would be a bit overshadowed by their familiarity from subsequent decades of stardom. Plus we've had lots of films about the Vietnam War since, and of course the violence is no longer very shocking.",r

At 182 minutes, it seemed to fly by, leaving me wanting more and wishing this would not end. all facets are explored, all people's emotions are laid bare, not just the combatants. If we obviously did not know better, one would have to say this was a British film, as it has all the best elements that British movie making displays. i can eulogise for hundreds of lines, but this really is the ONLY American movie i can think of (others? apart from taxi driver) that is RAW. A strange word i know but the movie oozes a raw edge to it. Immense performances from all concerned, and if i had to say, i believe i have not seen Christopher Walken in a better role.

25,24 October 2017,johnny-burgundy,10, The Deer Hunter is a masterful piece of cinema,"The Deer Hunter (1978) This is an epic war drama film about a trio of steelworkers whose lives are changed forever after they fight in the Vietnam War. The cast includes Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage, John Cazale, Meryl Streep, and George Dzundza. The story takes place in a little working class town south of Pittsburgh, and in Vietnam. The film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor for Christopher Walken. It also marked Meryl Streep's very first Academy Award nomination. She is now the most nominated actor in history. It was named the 53rd greatest American film of all time by the American Film Institute (AFI). The film's initial reviews were mostly positive. It was hailed by many critics as the best American epic since The Godfather. The late Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars and called it ""one of the most emotionally shattering films ever made."" This film is an American classic. It is my favorite drama, and perhaps my favorite film of all time. It even holds up nearly 40 years later. My willingness to try older films, any films, was because of this picture. Movies are like these are why film lovers should really give older movies a shot. I suggest the AFI's top 100 films as a starting point. The Deer Hunter is a masterful piece of cinema that explores the human condition in a way few films do today.",t

35,12 February 2019,ironhorse_iv,8," Oh Dear! This motion picture is not historical accurate at all. Despite that, it's still worth hunting for.","This movie directed by Michael Cimino is supposed to be in-depth examination of the Vietnam War and how its events, impacts and disrupts the lives of three Russian American Soldiers in many ways, when returning back to their small industrial town in Pennsylvania. However, the characters in the film are more traumatic by having to play a game of ""Russian Roulette' than anything else, they witnessed. The film really lingers on that in the 3rd act, to the point, that the movie is probably best known as today, as the 'Russian Roulette' motion picture. It has caused some film scholars to question if the movie really deserve all that praise, as it hardly has to do with any real after effects that soldiers came home with from the war. Don't get me wrong, this movie was truly one intense watch. However, I have to somewhat agreed, the flick is indeed highly fictionalized & somewhat unrealistic. Without spoiling the motion picture, too much, the reason for that, is because this 1978 Academy Awards Best Picture Winner was loosely based, first on an unproduced screenplay called, 'The Man Who Came to Play' by authors, Louis Garfinkle and Quinn K. Redeker, about a group of gamblers risking it all in Las Vegas, by playing Russian roulette. However, when producer Michael Deeley bought the screenplay, he hired director Michael Cimino & screenwriter, Deric Washburn, who hate each other, to work together to rewrite it. They did this, by having the deadly game take place in a Vietnamese Prison Camp between capture American soldiers, despite there being no documented cases of the game being played during the war. Regardless, those roulette scenes were shot in real circumstances, in dirty locations with the performers getting real beatings. The reaction from all the faces from all three principal actors, were somewhat genuine, especially Christopher Walken, who had no clue that he was getting slap for real. According to the director, the performers got so method with their acting, they requested, one real live cartridge in the revolver to heighten the intensity of the situation. That's totally insane! It's just as crazy to hear that Robert De Niro and John Savage mostly performed their own stunts, including the 30 foot drop fall into the river, 15 times in two days. They could had really got seriously hurt or even died. They almost did, as during a helicopter stunt, the skids caught itself on the rope bridge, nearly causing the copter to fall on two of the actors. They took a good amount of risk for actors deed too old for the ages, their character was supposed to be. Besides the stunts, the acting in this film is outstanding. There is no better example of this, than the 'One Last Shot' sequence. De Niro's emoting here, is ever brilliant, such a thoughtful performance. While, Walken's character just looks like a dead soul waiting for the body to followed. He's so hollow. What an amazing scene. Not to be outdone, the supporting cast were just as good as the main two. Despite, being a vague stock girlfriend character, Meryl Streep was fine in this role. Streep's then, boyfriend, John Cazale was also alright in the film. It's surprised me, to hear that he was very weak when filming began, due to being diagnosed with lung cancer. You really couldn't tell. Sadly, Cazale died shortly after filming was completed & never saw his work. Nevertheless, not all acting was praise, the film got some criticize on its one-sidedly portraying all the North Vietnamese as over the top sadistic racists and killers. Regardless of that, it's really hard to say, that this movie is an indeed a war film, when technically, the sequences involving Vietnam were a small part of the 183 minutes runtime. Most of the movie takes place, during a wedding. 51 minutes to be exact. Because of that, the movie's pacing has been claim to be, somewhat of a slowed burn to the point that Universal wanted the movie to be trim, even more. I somewhat agreed. Scenes like the drunk nude streaking could had been cut. Despite, the film going way over budget and overschedule. The movie is beautifully shot. There is no better example of this, than the deer hunting scene & the depressing climax involving ""God Bless America'. Overall: In spite of backlash from some Vietnam Veterans & War Historians who protest the film during its one theater released. The film was indeed successful enough at Oscars, that Universal Pictures widened the distribution to include major cities. It became a box office success. It made the bucks. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". That's how important, this film, has become to some people. For me, the over amount of praise for this movie is bit much. It's like, some critics don't mention, this film's big flaws in their reviews. Regardless of that, the movie is still worth watching. 'The Deer Hunter' might have starts out slow, but in the end, it's big bang. Highly recommended, checking it out.",

37,12 March 2010,moonspinner55,6, It affects people on the deepest of levels...but is it really interested in searching the souls of these men or in being a treatise in brutality?,"Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter"" is aching for a battle: even in the interminable wedding sequence, wine spills like blood. Though it won the Academy Award for Best Picture, the film is so puffed-up with a grisly sort of foul-mouthed machismo, one doesn't react to it as much as repel from it (much like John Boorman's ""Deliverance""). The movie isn't edited with precision, and yet it still stuns with its gripping depictions of savagery and man's inhumanity toward man. Unfortunately, the underlying point of the film seems to get lost in its general assemblage; both the editing and Cimino's direction are not as sharp one might hope (particularly in the final 45 minutes). Three men from a blue-collar town in Pennsylvania serve harrowing time in Vietnam, while life on the homefront seems repressed under a constant cloud of uncertainty and hopelessness. Cimino grinds the audience down, not with the intermittent scenes of violence but with the anticipation of those moments. It's a bludgeoning slab of filmmaking. There isn't much mystery in Cimino's approach; however, when a sensitive moment is called for, the director certainly delivers. Performances and technical aspects are at the highest level (which causes viewers to react, like it or not), but this isn't art any more than it is an anti-war film. **1/2 from ****",

It is not a bad film but then again it is not a good film either. For me the film is stitched together like a modern day Frankenstein and does not work on any level save one. It works reasonably well as an anti war propaganda creation but then I have seen better. The cast and crew must have been professional enough to work on this job and probably tried their best to produce a really classy film. Unfortunately the end result is not good. On more than one occasion I fell asleep while watching the film and not only during the extended wedding footage. The film just doesn't do it for me and I doubt it ever will. If I was on a podium my message would be that war disrupts everything, is completely and utterly pointless, millions of people die or are maimed for life and then those who are left have to rebuild again and the poor are still poor; the tragic consequences are the poor have probably lost what little they had and the well off survive like they always have throughout history. Whether I am wrong or right doesn't matter but if I was speaking for too long the message loses its power and this film is far too long and self indulgent and by the end I was glad it had finished. I have no doubt that my comments will be waved away as some loony person from across the pond but like I have said before its only my 'two cents' opinion and opinion is all.

I waited in line to see it on Opening Night in 1978. As a Vietnam veteran and a huge DeNiro fan, I was really looking forward to the first big movie about Nam. And it was as hideous, boring, exploitive, senseless, and unrealistic that night as it is now! They're going to Nam the next day?!? Without any kind of basic training or anything? The Walken character survives how many years playing Russian roulette?? How does DeNiro get away with that beard in Special Forces? I knew many soldiers from Western Pennsylvania steel mills, but not one with Walken's blow-dried hair-do that not even New York dancers were wearing till the late '70s! Okay, so let's suspend disbelief and not criticize its lack of anything vaguely realistic. In that case, we are left with a boring, long, boring, disjointed, boring, meaningless, exploitive piece of crap that had nothing whatever to do with the Vietnam War. And did I mention boring? For those who want a movie about the Vietnam War, I recommend Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, and a wonderful almost-unknown Burt Lancaster movie called Go Tell The Spartans that also came out in '78. Almost every Vietnam vet I know liked Apocalypse Now -- almost all thought The Deer Hunter was crap. And Cimino's later career supplies ample evidence for that point of view!",

61,3 March 2007,daniel-ambia,3, This movie sucks,"First of all, The Deer Hunter is boring. In the tradition of the Godfather there is a forty-five minute long wedding scene in the beginning where we learn absolutely nothing about the title characters except for that they are Eastern European, that they all like to get drunk and that three of them are joining the army even though all of them look well above maximum enlistment age. Then they go hunting and you learn that, okay they are all hunters. Next, with absolutely no back story, Michael (Deniro) is in the middle of a Vietnamese village when he reunites with his two friends from home. Then all of a sudden they are all in what looks like a POW camp where they play Russian roullete with the guards. Due to limited dialogue and even more limited plot structure most of this film makes absolutely no sense. Although the actors gave critically acclaimed performances, none has the opportunity to shine in my opinion. Also the director obviously had no military advisors on set because he would have known not to put in several details, (fellow soldiers could point them out immediately). Overall I was disappointed because the cast is very promising and even the concept is kind of intriguing, but the movie is just a mess and too poorly edited for a plot to be deriven from it at any point. This should not be called a war film just a boring ass movie wherein Christopher Walken looks really young, that's all. Oh and Meryl Streep looks pretty hot.",
62,25 March 2007,drystyx,4," not very interesting, but realistic drama of citizens who want to serve","This is not a captivating movie by any sense. It doesn't hold your interest, and is best seen in clumps. That said, it gives a half way accurate, realistic viewpoint of regular working folks during the Viet Nam War. How it affects them, before they see war, and afterwards. There are liberties taken. For instance, the three home town buddies are assigned together in Viet Nam. I've been in the Air Force, and that's just not something that is done. I'm sure the other branches are the same way. But that is poetic license. The chief character, De Niro, descends into madness. He begins with a very stable attitude. The sort of character you feel won't go berserk.That is what the script intended. He is the stable force, or at least the outwardly stable force. When he returns from the war, he has changed. On his regular hunting trips he reveals the change, until fellow hunter, Cazale, who plays a likable bum, irritates him into near insanity. De Niro issues his famous line ""This is this!"" And of course it is an insane line, but just the sort of line such a man would say. Not for someone who wants a lot of action. In fact, the hunting trip scenes are more interesting than the war scenes. Still, a very good psychological portrayal, and excellent acting make this one what it is. And if you like those qualities more than entertainment and action, this could be the movie for you.",
63,20 September 2009,khanbaliq2,10, The Deer Hunter is one of the most powerful and dramatic war films ever.,"When I decided to watch The Deer Hunter I thought that I would see a war film, but instead what I got was a drama film that lasted for about three hours. The Deer Hunter was released in 1978. It was directed by Michael Cimino. The film received high critical acclaim, won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, and Cimino was even hailed as a genius. The film boasts a great cast, including Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale, John Savage and Meryl Streep. They all provide stellar performances.",
64,7 June 2003,Slime-3,4, Is that what all the fuss was about in 78?,"Is that it? Is that the famous Deer Hunter which provoked the studios into giving the same director a seemingly limitless budget for Heaven's Gate? What were they thinking? Perhaps from this distance in time it's hard for someone, already familiar with the string of very unpleasant Vietnam movies which followed, to appreciate the impact this movie made on first release. It must be said APOCALYPSE NOW , though earlier, stands up much better and is certainly superior in it's production values, direction and plot. Viewing THE DEER HUNTER in the 21st century , it seems like a rather dull character piece which just happens to involve a 'Nam subplot but could equally have been set in the 1940s and involve Iwo Jima or Anzio. It also features a massivly underedited wedding scene which goes on and on and on.OK for those interested in how it's done in a Russian Orthadox way, but very self indulgent of the director. In truth the wedding itself with endless dancing, and song adds almost nothing of remote importance to the movie. It colours the background, but that needed only a five minute sequence which, if edited well from the footage here, could have been quite visually arresting. It really seems a waste of what must be more than 30 minutes of film(maybe longer I wasn't counting, I was almost snoring).It also seems to ape THE GODFATHER in some respects. There are redeeming factors. Industrial Pensylvania with it's grim steel works and nightmare landscape, is well photographed, reminding us of the how the back streets of New York were presented in MIDNIGHT COWBOY. The glorious mountain country of the deer hunting scenes also looks great, but the plot is so dull,so predicatable and so heavily laced with allegories that it negates all those positive aspects.  DeNiro is good. Nothing more. Walken is probably better, but then his role is more interesting. Streep actually looks really good - we forget how attractive she looked at this time before sinking herself into character roles that didn't require such. She plays her role well but it's woefully underwritten. War movie cliches abound, even if we allow for the fact most Nam films since have drawn heavily on THE DEER HUNTER , I am sure most of these 'war is hell' cliches had been formed in Audi Murphy and John Wayne movies decades earlier.The whole point of the title is a scene so predictable you can almost count yourself into it at first viewing. There's also some truly clumsy use of stock news footage of Saigon at the end of the war. It looks like someone pasted this in having forgotton to shoot the scene, and not relaised untill the movie reached the editing room! Even if the budget was small there was no need for this in my view . None of the stock footage images are of any great dramatic importance and could easily have been dropped altogether. All in all I must say a huge disappointment for a movie I have waited 20 years to catch and which has such a high rating in the all-time-greats. Like LORD OF THE RINGS it's a monument to hype over content.",

66,5 July 2006,omoo22,3, The emperor's new clothes,"Despite managing to give fleeting impressions of importance and quality, this film is a complete put-on. The long ""set-piece"" scenes (wedding, Russian roulette, etc.) are much discussed, usually either in the context of being ""essential for character development"" or ""boring"". In fact they're a delaying mechanism behind which the filmmaker attempts to hide his lack of storytelling skills. Once he does try to move things along, awkwardly jumping without explanation or exposition from one bloated set-piece to another, you can see the reason for his procrastination - despite being desperate to give the impression of profundity and truth, he really has nothing to say. The actors go a long way toward diverting attention from the film's awkward vacuousness, by giving false and short-lived impressions of character and narrative, but this falls apart whenever the filmmaker attempts to make anything ""happen"" narrative-wise.",

This is got to be the saddest movie I've ever seen in my entire life because of the truth. Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro did an amazing job. Such a powerful film about such a controversial war. I think the directors did a phenomenal job explaining everything about war and the effects it has on the average soldier and their families. This film needs to be a requirement in every high school in the country. Such a sad ending.,
68,25 March 2010,tonygumbrell,1," Hollywood, pure Hollywood","All one has to do, is to read the plot synopsis given here by IMDb, to see how ridiculous this movie is. 1) The steel workers in the movie appear to be in their late twenties or early thirties (the actors were all in their thirties at least). They were too old to be drafted and sent to Vietnam. Men like that didn't have to join the army (which at the time would could result in their being sent to Vietnam). They would have hung on to their jobs and gotten married. 2) If by some miraculous twist (practically impossible) of fate they wound up in the Army, they wouldn't have served together in the same outfit in Vietnam. 3) The Special Forces were an all volunteer outfit made up almost entirely of career soldiers who had to meet special qualifications to be selected. 4) Very few of our soldiers were captured by the enemy (most of the POWs were downed pilots). Bamboo (tiger) cages were a scandal notoriously used by our side (not theirs) to imprison enemy ""Viet Cong"" or NLF combatants or suspects (this was turned around cleverly in the movie, so Americans (the audience) can feel themselves victimized). 5) The absurdity is taken further with the Russian roulette hokum. This is utterly contrived to show the insidious brutality of the ""oriental"" fiends who seek to unman our red-blooded, masculine, all-American steelworker heroes. While nothing like this ever really happened, the point however is to mimic the famous scene (viewable in the documentary ""Hearts and Minds"") in which the Chief of Police of South Vietnam puts a pistol to the head of a prisoner with his hands tied behind his back and shoots him dead point blank, again the movie turns the imagery completely around. Lastly, the big lie in the movie is that we poor Americans have been victimized by the diabolical, insidious, inhuman orientals. Our big, strong, hulking men have been rendered temporarily impotent and defenseless against this nefarious surreal menace. In the end our boys loyalty and patriotism sees them through, though they may be physically maimed and will be emotionally scarred for live by what has transpired on this heinous foreign den of inequity. Almost nothing in the plot makes sense nor could it ever have happened save in the fertile imagination of a cunning Hollywood hack. If you like this movie, you've got some growing up to do.",

Cimino 's choice of backdrop for the characters in the movie was very well done...However, he miserably fails in many aspects of the military service of the three characters. From Michael's full beard, to the inaccuracies of his uniform, to the amount of time lapse in the movie, it is all bothersome to me, not to mention the ""russian roulette"" sequences with Nick near the end...there doesn't seem to be evidence that this ever happened in real life. All the above having been said, I believe Meryl Streep gives a wonderful performance as someone who was left behind during the war and suffered from the effects.

98,3 August 2015,ragpap93,5, Sorry but the movie was too long,I don't know about everybody else but to me the movie was too long. The first hour was slow but it was pointed out by others that this was intentional so as to show a sudden contrast to the intense war scene. The war scene was the best part of the movie and probably even ahead of its time but then we come back to after the war and it was slow once again. Also this time it was gloomy compared to how cheerful it was before the war. I do appreciate the comparison and it was almost poetic like a play but this was not what I was looking for in this movie. However even if this was what I was looking for it would still be too long. Red stain on the wedding dress and maybe the folks were very cheerful before the war sets the tone for what was about to come. On an entirely unrelated note the main character hunts deer for sport hence the deer hunter. In my opinion not worthy of being in the top 250 at least not anymore as there are lots of well deserved movies waiting to take its place.,

110,10 January 2006,sol-,7, My brief review of the film,"A film in which there is a lot that can be discussed, this is a good film overall, but definitely one with some flaws. The film is essentially about the varying possible effects that undergoing torture can have on different individuals. With the Vietnam War in the backdrop, it could be deduced that the film is also about the effects of war on the individual, but such little time is spent war scenes that it is hardly a war film, and war related themes are derived only from the symbolism that one might associate Russian roulette with. Anyway, that should be hardly taken a statement on the quality of the film. Cimino is able to set up some really intense scenes, the acting is generally fine, and the film does have some solid ideas, not only about the effects of torture, but also about strong friendships. The key element that limits the power of the film is a number of plot contrivances, that vary from being rather unlikely to next to impossible, and that is without including some of the factual wrongs with the film. The reoccurrence of Russian roulette could also be regarded as heavy-handed, depending on whether one regards it as a symbol of the futility or chances of war. Could something else not also be used to allude to this? It also is an overly long and drawn out film. The first hour is meant to give us a chance to know the characters a bit better, but even so, it goes on for too long, full of excesses of dance, humorous bits and abandoned subplots, all that inform us precious little of the characters. There is a subplot with two of the characters in the latter half of the film that is undernourished too. The music is not really any help either: it is too sickly sentimental to tie in very well. I found a few others things that I also did not like that I will not mention here for fear of ruining a fresh experience of the movie. It is a good film, even if a grueling watch, despite its drawbacks. As a film about the everlasting physical and mental effects of torture, it does a reasonable job, and as a film about the extreme lengths that one goes for a friend, it also stands up fairly well.",

115,8 June 2004,sachsad,8, Not without flaws but the most real portrayal of Vietnam I've seen,"I had difficulty with the first hour of The Deer Hunter.  My two problems concerned technicalities and length.  In a three-hour movie, I feel everything should function in the narrative or inform the viewer's understanding of the narrative.  That being said, I felt there was a lot of fat that could have been trimmed in the very opening of the film, and especially the wedding.  Meryll Streep's first appearance seemed unnecessary, her getting a drink with Robert De Niro's character, the very opening with the truck, and various shots could have been cut down-production companies might have seen Cimino's future mistakes with Heaven's Gate coming had they paid attention to these issues. I also felt at first that the cinematography and sound quality were poor. It didn't look visually real when I felt it should have, and there seemed a lot of audio inconsistencies (ie background noise that changed from shot to shot).  THAT being said, these concerns were soon put to rest when I saw the reason for cinematography that wasn't aesthetically pleasing.  Once Mikey, Nicky, and Steve went to war, I realized that this movie was meant to seem like a documentary in a way-no fancy cinematography so the viewer could notice a certain amount of work put into aesthetics and think more about that than context.  I felt like I was there and everything was shot on location and the Russian roullette scenes were really happening.  It seemed to me the most real portrait of the Vietnam War I've seen, and I now appreciate movies like Full Metal Jacket which didn't resonate prior to seeing the Deer Hunter. Christopher Walken also gave his most powerful and unforgettable performance that he has not outlasted since.  I wasn't watching Christopher Walken; I was watching his character Nick.

It seems that his name is unfortunately doomed to go down in history as of a director whose third film completely ruined his career—Heaven's Gate not only led a distinguished American studio into bankruptcy, but also enraged critics and the audiences to a degree of making every Cimino's future project destined to fail, both critically and commercially. After his second feature, the world simply expected him to keep delivering in the future. It's extremely difficult to live up to that kind of expectation when you introduce yourself to the world with a film like The Deer Hunter. The gloomy all-American epic story of three steel workers from a small town in Pennsylvania deeply and differently affected by the Vietnam war completely swept the United States off their feet back in 1978, earning five Academy Awards and turning the world's spotlights on Cimino in the process.",
122,16 February 2020,jayjaycee,9, How war destroys the lives of innocent people...,"""The Deer Hunter"" is a 1978 war drama directed by Michael Cimino starring Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken. Films centred around the brutality and meaninglessness of war have always played a major role in modern cinema and never failed to remind the audience of said aspects. Each and every war in the history of mankind was at least depicted once and, in the most cases, in a super realistic manner. From classic World War II drama ""Saving Private Ryan"" to recently released World War I feature ""1917"" every single battle is at least represented once. The Vietnam war makes no exception in this concept. But before there was Francis Ford Coppola's epos, there was ""The Deer Hunter"". If my researches are correct it's one of the first, if not literally the first film to depict this horrifying time in history that seems to still pose as a trauma in the hearts of countless Americans. And yet, it's not a genre typical movie at all, because the conflict itself is a means to the end. Basically, it's a character study centered around the soldiers in the first place. This three hour long cinematic colossus is principally divided into three stages: Before, during and after the protagonists have been to hell. While it could be seen as a narrative flaw that the scenes are generally stretched and simply too long in the first place, I think that's one of the films extraordinary strengths. In the first act, it intentionally takes much time to build up the character constellation and gives us the chance to intensively get to know them. Before they went to war, they're only a group of best friends from a Pennsylvanian industrial small town enjoying life to the fullest, fooling around, drinking beer and go hunting and celebrating their best friend's wedding as the climax. It's supposed to portray the simplicity and carelessness of life - without any worries and problems. The first hour of runtime literally shows how they do said things. It might be a decision other viewers might dislike, but I personally love this almost tragically slow pace. It had an effect on me, because in this one specific scene where on of the friends quietly plays the piano and the others become silent is just breathtaking, because they all become aware of what will happen next. Supported by the rough editing style, the film then all suddenly switches to Vietnam at a moment's notice. Without any preparation or unnecessary stretching. That's the metaphorical brutality I was talking about. In the second act, the brutality shows itself through blood, gore and nasty violence, what it has literally always been, reaching the top in the first Russian roulette scene. High tension and brilliant acting at it's finest, gut-wrentching and shocking in both effects and narration. Surprisingly, of it's whole duration the film spends the shortest amount of time on the battlefield, as it then focuses on the three individual cases of the now separated friends: DeNiro's Michael comes home to find himself in a place that doesn't feel like home anymore and seems to no longer enjoy the things that used to make him happy, Savage's Steven is crippled and physically suffers from the effects of combat and Walker's Nick is AWOL and sick of the pointlessness of fighting. It mercilessly continues to show how a meaningless war destroys the easy lives and friendship of simple men and disrupts them irreversibly. Astonishing character development included. It's ingeniously underlined by two prominent metaphors. The first being the Russian roulette that occurs in the context of enforcement, entertainment and free choice and is supposed to show that anyone can die in a war that was motivated by many different aspects and may cost the life of anyone, out of nowhere and randomly. The second metaphor is the meaning of the titular deer hunting, as it's supposed to boldly show how senseless killing of any living creature is. All in all, this touching character study relentlessly depicts how a meaningless war impacts the lives of innocent and happy young humans permanently. It's absolutely brutal on many levels, from visuals to emotional depth and once again shows through unusual, yet excellent writing and acting performances of its leads that nobody ever wins at war. An important entry to the genre and magnificent example that a three hour behemoth can feel like a ninety minutes feature without any problems. That's cinema at it's finest.",

Instead of adopting the gung-ho heroic approach to the conflict that the later '80s cheese-fests did, THE DEER HUNTER emphasises realism throughout.

Having never served in the military, I can only surmise about the possibility of three hometown friends going into the service together who wind up consistently running into each other over the course of a war thousands of miles from home. It begins with the helicopter drop a little over an hour into the story, when Nick (Christopher Walken) and Steven (John Savage) come upon Michael (Robert De Niro) as he's taking out a Vietcong terrorizing a South Vietnamese village. The same holds true for Michael discovering Nick in a Saigon gambling den where the fictional Russian roulette game takes place.

Though over three hours long, it's astonishing, paced so achingly right and I can see why he rightfully earned the 'carte blanche' that would unfortunately lead to his downfall (as well as an entire studio's) as soon as he made his next film. But to reach such heights and to have such ambition--as well as undeniable talent--is a victory in and of itself. Just armed with the main five actors alone, at the zenith of their craft, a fine script (really the first interesting and well-deliberated Vietnam film to hit the big screen) and Vilmos Zsigmond behind the camera meant that this would prove something special. Scenes that will haunt you forever. My favourite shot is the incredible 360-degree pan shot around Linda's bedroom when she realizes she's given up on Nick and is going to declare her love to Michael--extraordinary stuff. What's YOURS?

136,30 December 2005,ortyepefy,3, One of the most superficial movie on Vietnam war,"I really dislike this movie for several reasons. First, because, from an historical point of view, it seems to me highly politically incorrect. In fact, it describes Vietnam war in a too partial and superficial way. Partial because Vietcongs (vietnam soldiers) are always and only seen as bad and cruel, whereas us soldiers are all somewhat heroes. Other movies, by other (us !) directors, like Oliver Stone, describes THAT war in a very different manner, showing heroism (sometimes) and cruelty (so often !) on both sides. In my opinion, the movie is also superficial because, talking about war in general, describes war as some sort of a ""hard competition"" between adult men. I am wondering if not only Vietnam war but only one of modern wars fits this description. I am afraid that all modern wars, Vietnam war included, are better described as long sequences of useless massacres involving innocent women, babies, old men and women. As a last observation, in my opinion some sequences are really absurd. Which is the probability that one survive Russian roulette FOR MONTHS ? Which is the probability that two caught soldiers get free from their enemies without any help from outside by simply taking the guns from their enemies trousers ? In this respect, I think a mistake concerning the chosen genre has been done.

That's allowed, you know; you're not making a documentary. But if that's what they're going with, allow me to counter: We *do* know that American troops engaged in atrocities including massacres. I'm not saying that their behaviour came out of nowhere(which is not to say that it can be excused under any circumstances, at most it can be explained). However, if you're going to make something up that puts the other side in a negative light, you ought to also show some of the unflattering truth about yourself. I won't claim that this is poorly done from a technical standpoint, or that the performances are bad. That is all I can say of good things about this. It is an abusively long and boring piece that at no point captured my interest. I wasn't missing explosions, a clear-cut hero or a moral; merely for stuff to get me to find it worth the time(and yes, I do love several 3 hour pictures). Someone to care about(other than Streep). Early on, I could barely tell anyone apart; they're all drunk and behaving like morons. I couldn't like any of them in the least. These obnoxious characters have sudden, instant changes of heart at apparently random times. The pacing is uneven with jolting cuts. This is shot entirely on location(no sets), and the sound-side is great. It ""feels"" real. I gotta say, between this, Year of the Dragon and *Desperate Hours*, I've about given up on Cimino. There is plenty of strong language(also a little in the informational and subtitled commentary by the director and a film critic), a bit of bloody violence and brief male nudity in this. The 2-Disc Special Edition DVD comes with aforementioned audio track, three interviews(that I will review on their individual pages here on the site) and a 7 minute photo gallery, coming to 57 minutes total, as it says on the cover. I recommend this to... I honestly don't know. Evidently, a lot of people love this, and hey, maybe I just don't see what they do in it. Personally, I'd go for Platoon or Full Metal Jacket instead of this. I can't determine who this movie is for. 7/10",

This is all thrown asunder when they enlist in the Vietnam War, something they speak of as a mere patriotic chore. Once they are captured by the Viet Cong, the true nature of the war is revealed as they experience genuine fear, desperation and brutality far exceeding what they can handle. Each of the characters has their own reaction but they are clearly shattered and can never truly return to a normal life. By the time we get to the end, we have witnessed a heartbreaking destruction of the protagonists into shell-shocked husks.

It is a trace of how the Vietnam War crossed the threshold into numerous lives and distorted them dreadfully without end. What I find wise about this story is its lack of any sort of slant for or against the war. However, times must have changed, because once it was one of the most emotionally devastating movies ever made, and now it is not.

I wouldn't call The Deer Hunter a Vietnam film, and I would hesitate to even call it a ""war film"". More than anything, I saw the film as an exploration of how war affects the lives of people, not just the people that actively participate in the war, but also the people close to them. In The Deer Hunter, it is an exploration of regular American citizens in small-town USA, Pennsylvania to be exact. Some people may say the scenes in the opening are too stretched out, regarding the whole wedding and the deer hunting, and that the Vietnam scenes are occupy too little screen time. I would respectfully disagree. If you go into this movie thinking it will be a war movie, you'll be disappointed. It's a drama, a flawed drama about flawed people in a flawed town participating in a broken war. I loved every second of it and was captivated profoundly by it.

As an anti-Vietnam War veteran protester, I found the film extremely offensive. Cimino admitted in an interview that he knew of no such Russian roulette game played in Asia; he made it up. Now, I would not whitewash the Viet Cong; war is hell and they could play the devil. But it was their country; we had no business being there. When I left the film, I told my friends, ""I guess General Westmoreland was right.""(the General in an interview had pulled out that old cliché that Asians have no regard for human life). As I watched the film, I kept thinking where is Lieutenant Calley right now? This film is the most politically incorrect interpretation of the war that could possible be made, and all the critics at the time were blinded by the effective performances and depiction of the terror inflicted by those ugly, perverse Asians.

157,9 June 2014,BeMi21,6, Disappointing,"First of all I have to say, that I was completely aware that this is not a movie that will (only) show the war in Vietnam but that it's more about the characters who go there. Nevertheless, I was quite disappointed. In my opinion the movie is just too long. The beginning was quite promising: You see that the friends don't know how serious and dangerous this war is, they consider it more as an ""adventure"" and are actually looking forward to it. But the only ""helpful"" or meaningful scenes at the wedding (which I found almost boring) were the scene with the returning soldier from Vietnam and the proposal by Nick to Linda. Also the hunting scenes could have been shorter. The part in Vietnam is really great. I don't have to say much about that, it's really breathtaking and shocking and when Nick is questioned at the hospital his traumas are intensely shown. The third part has its strength and its weaknesses. The beginning is quite good, we see that Michael wants to avoid what seems to the others his ""old, normal"" life. But still, to me Michaels problems stayed superficial, maybe I expected too much. The last encounter between Michael and Nike is very moving and intense, I don't think there is much to discuss about that. So all in all I'd say the movie consist of a much too long ""introduction"" (I was completely aware that they don't take the war serious enough and of their ""normal"" American life after 20 minutes), a great second part in Vietnam and a good third part with some lengths which could be forgiven if the movie wasn't three hours long. But I won't understand what makes this movie to a masterpiece. Could the time when it came out have an effect on that? The Deer Hunter was one of the first movies that characterized the senselessness and insanity of that war and made you think about it. Still, I think that the absurdity of violence and war as well as posttraumatic stress disorder have been better illustrated in other movies by now.",

This is a great film when the actors are allowed to take centre stage: Robert De Niro was becoming America's greatest film actor, Christopher Walken was establishing himself as a brilliant young talent, and even the woman I love to hate, Meryl Streep, delivered a stunningly nuanced performance. The supporting cast is near flawless, and it's always a delight to see Shirley Stoler in any film, even when she's playing a Serbian mama.",
159,12 June 2016,barryrd,8, Life torn by war,"Michael Cimino, the director, has left us one powerful piece of work in this movie which is a portrait of small town life and how It is devastated by the war in Vietnam. The character development is superb with an outstanding cast of DeNiro, Walken, Streep, Savage and others. The small community in Western Pennsylvania is beautifully captured in the bar scenes, the wedding, the hunting trip, and the working life of the male characters in the local steel factory. I did notice the snowy mountains which didn't quite fit with my impression of Pennsylvania and it seems these were shot in Washington State. Not a huge deal given the calibre of the movie but I'm sure this wouldn't escape the notice of some viewers. The bond of friendship between DeNiro as Mike and Walken as Nick is sharply defined in the first hour and this relationship Is the basis for the story, which moves from Pennsylvaia to Vietnam and back again. We also see the angst heighten as the characters approach the day of Steve's wedding followed by their departure for Vietnam. The change in settings comes abruptly but flows seamlessly. The movie has dramatic war scenes that contrast with the beauty of the mountains where the deer hunting takes place. Graphic and shocking scenes in Vietnam heighten the sense of alienation from small town life in America. The movie is long but the script, the acting and imagery keep viewers riveted to this excellent story and its stunning photography.",

The fact that its re-interpretation of Vietnam has been so easily accepted by the vast majority of viewers makes it scarier.  I don't want to write my dissertation on the danger of cinema remaking history, but when you watch this film ask some critical questions about what it is saying to viewer about the past.  E.g. Why are the Americans always the victims of Asian aggression?  Why is the political/social/historical aspect of the conflict completely excluded (We see Saigon falling, but are not asked to see our role in the ensuing chaos)? Why is the tragedy of Vietnam exclusively its corruption of innocent American boys, over and over and over again? Just thought I'd add this perspective because movies, if they choose to deal with heavy subjects and want to be taken as a serious artistic statement, have to then accept the responsibility of affecting peoples understanding of history.",

164,14 June 2020,dr_clarke_2,8, Controversial but misunderstood,"Michael Cimino's Academy Award winning 1978 film The Deer Hunter is not without controversy. Sometimes described as a Vietnam War film, it has been criticised for its depiction of the North Vietnamese as one-dimensional evil sadists, and it was also - unfairly - subject to revisionist reviews following the release of Cimino's subsequent, career-destroying Heaven's Gate. But The Deer Hunter isn't really a film about the Vietnam War, and the downward trajectory of Cimino's later career should not detract from the fact the fact that it remains a remarkable accomplishment.
What The Deer Hunter is about, really, is friendship and the terrible effects of the horrors of war on the lives of those who fight for their countries: as Christopher Walken later suggested, the actual war depicted in the film is irrelevant. Indeed, there is very little here about the politics or the history of the Vietnam War, although the screenplay does include subtle condemnation of it, particularly at the end. Instead, the story focuses on the lives of three steelworkers - Mike, Nick and Steven - whose lives are changed forever when they are put through the meat-grinder of conflict in a distant land.
And on this level, the film works well. Right from the start, the three central male characters are well written and brought to life by naturalistic performances from Robert de Niro, Christopher Walken and John Savage. All three actors give performances that allow us to get to know the characters, so that when they suffer it has real emotional impact. Savage is especially impressive when Steven is overcome with terror when he, Nick and Mike are first forced to watch and then to play the Russian roulette game. These scenes are, by any measure, harrowing and De Niro and Walken give incredibly intense performances. The plot is divided into thirds, with the first occupied largely by the wedding of Steven and Angela and a deer hunt by the central group of friends; it advances the plot very little, but it does a great deal for the characterisation by serving to demonstrate the normal lives of the three protagonists, showing the audience what they leave behind when they go to fight a war for their country, full of patriotic dreams just waiting to be dashed.
Cimino's direction is impressive and he manages to create a film that is in some ways broad in scope but intimate in its approach. The vast amount of money lavished on the film pays off, with impressive sets and Thailand location filming that simultaneously manages to be beautiful and oppressive. The lengthy wedding scenes might easily have felt like padding, but a combination of script, performances and Vilmos Zsigmond's gorgeous cinematography means that the film never drags. Indeed, Zsigmond does and outstanding job throughout, and brings a certain grandeur to the scenes inside the church. The location filming for the deer hunt - and the hunt itself - is beautifully filmed. By contrast, the moody scenes in Saigon (actually filmed in Bangkok) are filmed in such a way that everything looks sweaty, seedy and unpleasant.
Editor Peter Zinner provides a swift cut from the elegant scene of Axel playing piano in the bar to the blood-soaked fields of Vietnam; despite frequent descriptions of the movie as a war film, we see very little conflict on screen. Rather, Cimino focuses on the hellish situation that Nick, Mike and Steven find themselves in: the initial Russian roulette sequence shot on the banks of the River Kwai is actually relatively brief. The game - a controversial artistic license on Cimino's part that serves as a metaphor for war - has profound psychological effects on the three characters and the impact of these occupies the remainder of the film. Once the trio is rescued, the film cuts again, with the three dispersed. The final third of the film shows the aftermath of war for each of them; Mike returns home but feels isolated and guilty, and significantly he finds he can no longer shoot a deer in cold blood; Steven has been left physically broken, and Nick has been left mentally broken, symbolically continuing to play Russian roulette in Saigon and ultimately losing.
Whatever one thinks of the story, Cimino's technical achievements in The Deer Hunter should not be dismissed. As well as the three leads, he assembled an impressive cast that included a terminally ill John Cazale (who died before the film's release) and Meryl Streep in a small both well-acted role as Linda, the object of both Mike and Nick's affections. English composer Stanley Myers provides an excellent soundtrack, including the iconic theme tune. This is an impressive film on many levels: perhaps its greatest failing is that remains widely misunderstood.",
165,4 November 2019,andysevenfold,6, Robert De Niro was fantastic,The Deer Hunter (1978) is a psychological thriller about the effect that the Vietnam war had on a trio of friends. Robert de Niro and Christopher Walken play their parts fantastically and the famous Russian roulette scene had me on the edge of my seat. The criticism I have of this film is that the hour long first act wasn't needed at all and it could've been trimmed down to make the movie go by a little quicker. Robert De Niro was the stand out for me.,
166,4 July 2004,Sylviastel,10, Definitely a movie about war!,"In the end, it does not matter that you disagreed with the Vietnam War and America's involvement. This film is about the American men who went to Vietnam leaving in their relatives and friends behind to wonder what was happening over there. They went over there to serve their country because it asked them too or ordered them to go. Whatever the reason, the movie is full of fabulous performances by Meryl Streep, John Cazale, Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, George Dzundza, and John Savage. I think the cast is well-ensembled and brilliantly acted. The small town in Pennsylvania is quite important to know the significant impact that the war had on small towns in America. Everybody was affected by their absence. Not knowing their fates is often worse than knowing it. After the war, three of the men must face their lives back home. They are never the same again. The game of Russian Roulette is used effectively and frighteningly. We must remember that the Vietnam vets suffer enormously from being taken hostage by Vietcong. It does not matter but they suffer psychologically. Walken definitely deserved his Oscar. I just keep thinking about John Cazale in his last performance. He is dying of bone cancer in reality and dies after filming is over. The Deer Hunter is truly a powerful theme. The deer is a representation of humanity. Humans hunting and killing in the jungles of Vietnam is not much different than hunting and killing harmless deer in the mountains.",

""Coming Home"" which was one of the contenders for Best Picture for that year should have won as it was a far better movie and quite possibly may have won if Jane Fonda wasn't in it. In any case Deer Hunter was a big disappointment, for me anyway. DeNiro as usual played over the top when he should have been low key but then again I was never a big fan of his. Chris Walken on the other hand is one of the greatest actors of out time and his supporting Oscar was well deserved. In fact the movie could have been edited down by an hour with more concentration on Walken's character. Another thing that bothers me is the way they dressed DeNiro up as though he were Audie Murphy. He was drafted along with his buddies which meant a two year hitch and he wears a three year chevron on his arm and the ""time in combat"" hashes on his other sleeve show at least three years of combat???.

The Deer Hunter is one such movie but is different in the sense that it focuses more on character development than the actual war scenario. Based on a small town in America, the movie starts with the introduction of a group of town dwellers who are hard-working as well as hard-partying and whose favorite pass-time is hunting deer. Three people of the group are enlisted in the army and are bound to go to Vietnam. The war, their capture, the game of life - Russian Roulette, their escape, the consequences and the changes in their mentality and life as a whole is the movie. Each of the three men loose something valuable in the war and their happy -go-lucky attitude changes drastically into something which changes their way of life. ",

Total invention of history -- a history we will have to continue to revisit because of films like this. Remember, Cimino said he was in the Vietnam catastrophe. There was only one people truly suffering in this Govt/Corporate war for profit and rank advancement -- the Vietnamese. Three million of them died, countless more suffered horrific injuries, and the country to this very day continues to repair the countryside and land that US munitions made in some areas unlivable for decades. I tip my hat to US veterans, among whom Cimino was NOT one, though he claimed to be. A liar for life. Real Vietnam vets got horribly used in a policy that was doomed from the February 1965 beginning, from the defeat of the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, and from the US turning down Ho Chi Minh's appeal for peace directly after WWII.

Is it a masterpiece? No. However to conceive something so bold, daring and powerful is a remarkable achievement. A group of work colleagues and friends from Pennsylvania have their lives irrevocably changed by the Vietnam war. The classic microcosm of portraying small lives to create a scale of grandeur. These steelworkers weren't just representing themselves, but also the idealisms of America at that time. It's a one-sided affair, whether you view that as a detriment is entirely up to you. It does not hinder what is being shown. This is all about the character development, their emotional and physical changes through all three acts. Establishing their close bonds in the first act, putting their survival skills to the test in the second and then dealing with the psychological wounds in the third act. It's the perfect structure. The first act is easily the weakest. Thirty minutes of a wedding ceremony where people are Cossack dancing to the Tetris theme tune feels pointless, could've easily established the friendships in ten minutes. Aside from that, I thought this was pretty darn excellent. Robert De Niro holds the entire film together. Christopher Walken explores his wide emotional range of acting, he was terrific. Even a young Meryl Streep was incredible. Michael Cimino's direction was exhilarating, particularly during the war scenes. Shots were extensive, he took his time with the story and the characters. Then we get to the Russian Roulette scenes. Wow. Never seen anything quite like it. I was on the edge of my seat. Such a simple premise to include in a war film which guarantees thrills and fear. The final roulette scene was gut-wrenching. Captors betting on their survival, it really conveys how chaotic Saigon and the rest of Vietnam became during the war.

202,17 June 2006,Quinoa1984,8," Not the best film of 1978, but close","The Deer Hunter was one of the group of films that, in a sense, got me into more mature dramas and other types of films almost a decade ago. I remember liking the Deer Hunter, particularly the bulk of the scenes in Vietnam and of Walken in his iconic role as the Russian roulette doomed Nick, even though the wedding scene did seem to 'drag' for me. But watching it again I'm struck by how the grandiose nature of the picture, all of the deep and sorrowful emotions let out through the toll of war on these men, still holds up for me. And the wedding scene, upon a second look, is not as overlong as I thought but a rather brave example of how a real wedding goes on in all of its celebration and bittersweet moments (the scene at the bar where the soldier says 'f*** it' is memorable for me). The Vietnam scenes are likely the best in the film, with a heap of horrific suspense with bits of sick humor (if one were to look for it). Later, there are the roulette scenes, but also contemplative ones with De Niro in the woods, and maybe the most heartbreaking of the scenes with John Savage's Steve at the hospital. It's a film that did deservedly give Michael Cimino his (at first) big reputation for creating a touching, violent epic story of the toll of that most recent war of the time. If it's not as great as the other Vietnam film of the year, Coming Home, it might be because there are some scenes that don't work as well, even with co-stars like John Cazale (sadly his last film) and Meryl Streep. But the amount of things that do click in the Deer Hunter do make it one of those possible 'essentials' for the baby-boomers; it's also, as well, a jolt of a scar war movie at times.",

Conversations are natural and fluid, and actions are believable because the characters have been portrayed as capable of carrying them out.  Also, they *look* like real people.

So, with great anticipation I starting watching, and waiting for this great masterpiece to unfold, however it NEVER happened. The movie seemed disjointed, and made little sense.

This, even though the U.S. military in that era was made up predominately of draftees in their late teens and very early twenties, and even though a disproportionate number of them were black, because few blacks at the time could manage to get the student deferments that kept most white kids out of the war long enough for it to wind down to the point where they didn't get drafted. They are magically transported to Vietnam. Without engaging the enemy, they are taken prisoner and end up as pawns in a gambling game where prisoners are forced to play Russian Roulette. Even though their captors have several rifles trained on them at close range, a miracle happens, and they somehow escape. While still in Vietnam, one of them learns that this variation on Russian Roulette is the national pastime for the Vietnamese. They become separated while in Vietnam, and two of them return home separately. By the time these two meet up again, it has most likely been at least five years since they joined up, but they are all still the same age, still in their mid-thirties and early forties. And still not one black soul, anywhere to be seen. You would think that no black people fought in the Vietnam war. But one of them got stuck in 'Nam, playing Russian Roulette professionally, and evidently was very skilled at it, since he has been sending piles of cash to the one who came home in a wheelchair. The one that ended up in the Rangers, the Deerhunter, goes back to 'Nam to find the one stuck playing Russian Roulette. The Deerhunter finds his old friend Nick in a hidden away, secret room full of Vietnamese gambling on the Russian Roulette game, apparently the same marathon game that has been being played continuously for a number of years. Even though Nick has had the presence of mind to send money regularly to Steve, when Deerhunter finds Nick, Nick doesn't recognize Deerhunter and seems not to have any idea where he is, but knows that he is a professional Russian Roulette player. Deerhunter buys his way into the game, in order to try and talk Nick out of playing. To show Nick that he still loves him, Deerhunter takes his turn. The hammer falls, and Deerhunter is still lucky. Deerhunter again begs Nick to come home with him, but Nick takes another turn, and that's the end of Nick. Deerhunter escorts Nick's body home, and there is a funeral, not attended by any black people.",

The problem with this movie is we see no back story on any of these characters on why they are who they are. We spend all this time on watching a wedding where nothing of significance to the rest of the movie really transpires. We see just a glimmer of the Vietnam War that these men were in and other than the small screen time of their Russian Roulette torture we don't understand the horrors these men must have endured. The characters don't develop and don't have dialog that allows them too. I think Meryl Streep was the only one who conveyed anything of her character in this movie. A lonely woman who is clinging to whatever she can to survive this post war country. I am a huge Robert Deniro fan but I am in the minority in finding this film a wasted opportunity for all involved.

Like Apocalypse Now, it's hardly a conventional battle film--the soldier's experience was handled with greater authenticity in Platoon--but its depiction of war on an intimate scale packs a devastatingly dramatic punch. Director Michael Cimino may be manipulating our emotions with masterful skill, but he does it in a way that stirs the soul and pinches our collective nerves with graphic, high-intensity scenes of men under life-threatening duress. Although Russian-roulette gambling games were not a common occurrence during the Vietnam war, they're used here as a metaphor for the futility of the war itself. To the viewer, they become unforgettably intense rites of passage for the best friends--Pennsylvania steelworkers played by Robert De Niro, John Savage, and Oscar winner Christopher Walken--who may survive or perish during their tour through a tropical landscape of hell.

The wedding scene for example just seems to go on and on. In a weaker movie these kinds of scenes would bore the viewer, perhaps even make the film unwatchable. Not in this case. Because this isn't really a movie about the Vietnam war, like so many people seem to think. Admittedly the war part of the film is the most memorable and the one that people bring up most often, but the movie as a whole is more about the friendship between its main characters. The war is always there, certainly, but its point is to showcase how the terror of combat and the mental torture that follows affect people and how we all cope differently. Some of us manage to muscle through and go on to spend relatively normal lives. Some of us crack, however, and the film goes to great lengths to make us understand just how deep that single crack can go. How it can ruin the best of us.",

It is often heralded, along with ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979), ""Platoon"" (1986) and ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987), as one of the quintessential movies about the Vietnam Era. However, while all those movies are acclaimed as classics for their innate authenticity in one way or another, ""Deer Hunter"" is not. Especially the central motif of the movie -- Russian roulette -- which the film uses as the metaphor for the entire Vietnam War experience, is just as concocted as the alleged military service of the once-acclaimed-but-now-lampooned director, Michael Cimino. According to the co-writer Deric Washburn, Cimino's lies about both his service time and his involvement in the Vietnam War were at least partially responsible for the movie even getting made in the first place. However, this lack of actual experience, and the lack of desire to find out, also colored the film's portrayals of the Vietnam War and the entire era surrounding it.",

235,18 March 2022,williamford-17805,6, Overrated,"This film is a decent slow-burn but does not really fulfil its potential. It has a meandering plot that ultimately has little to say about most of its subject matter. The first act is needlessly slow (a full hour of the runtime), doing nothing other to than introduce a cast of mundane and not very likable average joes. The second act sees caricatured, ahistorical, pointlessly evil Viet Cong villains forcing our protagonists to play Russian roulette for little reason other than as a plot device to set up a dubious enthusiasm for the game among them. The third act consists of some rather shallow portrayals of PTSD, especially the one involving an acquired addiction to Vietnamnese Russian routlette that stretches belief. Characters fequently say and do things that make little sense, especially this bizarre eagerness to point guns at their heads and pull the trigger to make vague points to one another. It is strange that this film is so highly-regarded but that is likely owed mostly to the film's main redeeming qualities. De Niro's intense performance carries a lot of the film and its high production values do appear to have helped to provoke thought and reflection among audiences. But what a film it could have been, if the writing had actually gone somewhere or had something to say beyond a played out ""war is crazy"" message that has been delivered much more successfully in other classic Vietnam war films.",

The Deer Hunter takes place mostly in Pennsylvania and is about how the US-Vietnam war effects a small industrial town. This is one of the most interesting and unique war movies that I have watched.

238,14 December 2010,beesamstone22,3," My Opion of ""The Deer Hunter""","""The Deer Hunter"" was a very informative film about the Vietnam War. During the beginning of the movie, one could never tell that the movie would end so tragically. It started with four friends, Michael, Steven, Nick and Stan. The four friends worked together at the factory and enjoyed their simple lives by partying and hunting together. Mike, Steven and Nick end up in Vietnam and undergo many challenges such as playing Russian Roulett at the POW camp and trying to escape. This part of the film was very graphic and I didn't like it. I don't understand why such an enormous part of the film was about playing Russian Roulett considering that there wasn't any evidence that this game was played for sport or combat in Vietnam. I wish that there was more historically accurate occurrances in the film. I was also surprised when Mike wanted to leave Steven at the POW camp trapped in the underwater cage because I thought that Mike would want to save his friend. I'm glad that Mike and Nick got away but things didn't end up well for Nick because he became MIA and got into really bad things in Saigon. Nick was my favorite character and it made me very sad to find out that he was taking opium and couldn't remember Mike. The worst part of the film was when Nick loses Russian Roulett to Mike and Mike has to watch his best friend die. Everything was so different after the men came home from the war. Mike was sufferring from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder while Steven was missing a majority of his limbs and sanity. It is a shame that Nick had to lose his life to sport in the war rather than making it with his friends or fighting for his country.",

While it is a well-made well acted film somehow the whole story comes off as unrealistic, to me anyway. Had this story been set during WWII it may have been believable but not during the Vietnam War! How many guys who were tight knit like this bunch who worked together, partied together, hunted together left steady good paying jobs to enlist in the Army during that time period? Had they all been drafted OK but to just say, ""Hey were quitting our jobs to go into the Army and fight in Vietnam"" Come on! If that had been the case the Army wouldn't have needed a draft. (With one of them even getting married before he goes into the Army). Then they all stay together throughout Basic, Infantry training etc and then ""ALL"" become rangers, remain together once sent in to Vietnam and all get captured together?

Basically it is all about four friends, and how they are all affected (in whatever way) by the Vietnam war, whether in it or not. The four Pennsylvanian steel factory worker friends: Michael Vronsky (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Robert De Niro), Stan 'Stosh' (The Godfather, Part II's John Cazale), Steven (John Savage) and Nick (Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Christopher Walken) are dedicated to joining the war in Vietnam, and at Steven's marriage to pregnant bride Angela (Rutanya Alda), the wedding party also serves as a farewell before Michael, Steven and Nick depart. Then of course an explosion marks their time in Vietnam, and the horrors to come, as they are imprisoned by the Vietcong army. Steven is still in a cage, but Michael and nick are forced to play Russian roulette against each other (the most memorable and notable scene of the whole film, and two more games follow later). They manage to escape, and the rest of the film sees them separate, and we see mainly seeing trying to recuperate, while Steven is handicapped having lost his leg, and Nick is still in Vietnam, leaving his girlfriend Linda (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep, in her first major role) worrying. Of course Michael goes after him, and Nick is still playing Russian roulette, sending the reward to Steven, and tragically trying to bring him home Michael witnesses Nick losing, and the film ends with a funeral, a short song, and a toast to him. Also starring Basic Instinct's George Dzundza as John, Chuck Aspegren as Axel, Shirley Stoler as Steven's Mother, Pierre Segui as Julien, Mady Kaplan as Axel's Girl and Amy Wright as Bridesmaid. It may be long, but it is certainly worth it for the great performances (notably Walken), the Russian roulette scenes, and the wonderful guitar music by Stanley Myers. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Editing, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Screenplay and Best Sound Track, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Meryl Streep was number 58, Christopher Walken number 34, and Robert De Niro number 2 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, De Niro was number 50 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Streep was number 26, Walken number 14, and De Niro number 5 (along with Al Pacino) on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 30 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 12 on The 100 Greatest War Films.

252,14 August 2021,mcjensen-05924,2, This Was One Awful Movie By Any Standard,"Bad. Really, really bad. Soundtrack is grating. Editing is non-existent. Dialogue is horrendous and simple minded. It's hard to know where to begin because it failed on every level, and the fact it's supposed to be a superior example of film making staggers my imagination. It gets worse each time I try to endure it. Where as the wedding scene in Godfather served a purpose and set the tone for the movie, the wedding scene at the start of this was an ordeal to suffer. So much awful music and dancing I had to mute it. Even fast forwarded it a bit. Just a bunch of guys slamming booze and acting like fools. Then a hunting trip where they act like fools some more. DeNiro was an immensely unlikeable jerk who acts all tough and smart but wouldn't even borrow a friend a pair of boots. Seems like he's a petty fool. Then off to Nam where somehow they all end up together as POW's playing Russian Roulette. Completely fabricated nonsense that negates any power the war might have added to this petty drama. After the war, back in Pennsylvania, things resume and everyone acts like buffoons again. All through the movie the scenes are drawn out and waaayyy too long. The way everyone relates to each other just doesn't seem like they knew each other at all. Streep was gorgeous but her role plays shallow because the writers never gave her any depth. So many things happen that would never happen, in USA and in Nam, that the whole movie fell flat because it was tripping over it's own tediousness and incompetentness. The grit and desperation of the steel town was conveyed somewhat effectively, but all the inhabitants came across as maroons. Especially that bartender guy whole persona is just over the top goofy. It simply didn't age well. In fact it was garbage when it came out, but seemed to grab everybody's attention as a milestone of great acting and film making. It's not. It's either just silly or monotonous or stupid. Drink. Dance. Drink. Hunt. Fight. Hunt. Have meaningless talks. Act like dopes. Really fun viewing experience for imbeciles. The music is extremely horrible and distracting. My gosh man who needs to listen to opera and choir music again and again? Just another thing to detract from a storyline that is already failing. Some nice nature scenes while hunting, but it was obvious it was filmed somewhere other than where they were supposed to be. I've never seen DeNiro play such a turd. Walken & Savage were eaually absurd. I honestly don't know what anyone was thinking while filming these scenes. How could they not know they were assembling the worst pile of crap ever?

The horrors and trauma of war are on display as well. But the film has many faults which make it a flawed and overrated work. First, Cimino created an unfocused 50 minute wedding episode with many unnecessary scenes (ie., groping, prolonged dancing) for an overlong 3+ hour film. Second, it seemed odd that the hunting scenes should occur in a region obviously not remotely close to the iron belt of the northeast. An impressive view on display, but nothing within 2000 miles closely resembles it. Next, the NVA soldier's murder of villagers with a grenade seemed unrepresentative of NVA and VC treatment of civilians. While the Cambodian army and others senselessly murdered many innocent women and children, this didn't seem like a common sin of the Vietnamese. Finally, the central element of Russian Roulette falsely portrayed it as a favorite past time in SE Asia. Sure, it could be true for prisoners of war, but not by locals in Saigon. No doubt many liked gambling, but not with bullets. It creates great suspense, but not much reality. Such faults make the film not just a fiction, but very grim prolonged fantasy.",

Whereas most Vietnam films have a tenancy to deliver their message in a strident and sometimes heavy-handed way, ""The Deer Hunter"" refrains from overdramatic moments where the characters break out into soapbox monologues about the horrors and immorality of war. It does not hit the same pot-holes that some generally well-made movies on the subject (such as ""Apocalypse Now,"" most of Oliver Stone's contributions, and, for that matter, the same year's ""Coming Home"") have encountered.

273,12 November 2018,landfather,4, Don't EVER do that to me again.,"I don't think there's ever been a movie more dedicated to making me feel just awful. I realize how horrid and cruel war is, but to have it shoved down my throat in such a brutal manner was very unnerving and only left me with an upset stomach and shaking my head. I don't know just how accurate it's telling was, but all I could do was cringe and look away through most of it. The only reason I gave it four stars was because of the stellar acting performances by DeNiro, Walken, Streep and the others. In fact, I think it was their believeablity that made me have such a strong reaction to the film. There's nothing I appreciate more than our soldiers and veterans, whom I feel are getting the fuzzing end of the lollipop when it comes to what they deserve for their service to this country, and I'm sure that's one of the reasons this movie left me with an incredibly bad taste in my mouth. This is one of those films that you either hate or love and it seems there's really no in between with it's ratings. Sorry all you The Deer Hunter fans, I know where you're coming from, but for me, this movie literally hurts too much to watch.",
274,19 April 2007,adamd-8,10, Cinematic Brilliance,"No movie before or after has effected me remotely as much as ""The Deer Hunter"" has. It is without a doubt the most emotionally driven, heartbreaking film I've ever experienced. The plot with it's simplicity instantly draws you into the lives of these characters which can easily be adapted to persons we all know or have known in our lives. The film opens to a small working class factory town seemingly isolated from the rest of the world. Main characters are established and we discover the underlying truth that seems to hang over everyone like a dark cloud. It is the middle of the Vietnam War, and three of the friends are volunteers to leave everything they know within the next few days. I break this movie into 3 parts, before, during and after the war. Before the war we see character development at it's best. We see 1 friend get married and experience a traditional Russian wedding. At one point DeNiro and Walken's characters encounter a soldier at a bar and when asked a response about their departure the soldier replies simply ""fuck it"". I thought this was a brilliant suggestion for things to come. The start of the second part begins by blowing your mind with a scene jump that is comparable to that of 2001:A space Oddyssey. Here we experience a game of forced Russian roulette onto the 3 friends. I remember the first time watching this scene barely able to keep control when placing myself in their position imagining what it would be like to play live and die with someone so close to you they are like your blood. When Robert DeNiro laughs in the face of his captors, sweat and tears streaming down his face, pleading his best friend to pull the trigger, it is without a doubt the most extreme example of raw emotion a movie has ever been able to produce. The final part of ""The Deer Hunter"" we see the aftermath that a war can bring, not on a nation, but of the families and friends and their relationships with one another. Whether drawn in or ripped apart, the impact on such a tightly knit group of individuals is devastating. In all,my favorite part of this movie is the message that I got from it. To me The Deer Hunter tells us that no matter what happens throughout our lives, we always have a home and there will always be someone there to lick our wounds and recover from the horrors that the world sometimes has. This is not an anti-war film and for those who may say it is have missed the picture. Agree or disagree with the diplomatic actions of a nation, America is beautiful because of the people in it and as long as we embrace, this we'll always have a home. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! 10 out of 10 stars.",

285,1 December 2014,Haleybeann97,4, Review of the Deer Hunter,"#1 What was the director trying to get at? He was trying to explain how bad Russian Roulette was, Also he was explaining how much it went it was played back in the old days during the war. Do you agree or disagree with his concept? I agree because it was really bad. It was a kind of patriotism because it was a common game that the Vietnamese play, for fun or for sacrifices of desperate lost and sad souls. Souls of people that are rich but want to die. #2. After they got out of the war their personalities changed, All of them. Mike used to be an honest, straight-forward friend, But after the war Mike loses his masculinity and becomes more sensitive throughout his experience in Vietnam. Nick is an easygoing, fun loving, introspective and somewhat quiet man who values friendship, community and love. But after the war he went to a Russian roulette game, and was there for a long time. He was there for so long he turned up to be brainwashed. Could it have happened differently? Possibly if they stayed together and all got on the helicopter. Instead of one getting on the helicopter and two not get on it. If they all got on Steve wouldn't of broke his legs. (they were amputated). #3. What's the deal with the French character who introduces Nicky to the Russian Roulette den in Saigon? He introduces Nicky to the Russian Roulette so the men can get more money. And more people (Nicky) would continue the game. Plus Nick had a lot of money on him. What is this character suppose to symbolize? He was there to symbolize a man that forces people to do things they don't particularly want to. #4. Why does Mike go back to Vietnam to find Nick? He goes back to find Nick to make Linda happy. Mike was Nicks best friend. Linda was all emotional when Nick wasn't with Mike when he arrived back at the house. But when he gets to the Russian Roulette game place (where nick was) Mike found out that nick was brainwashed. That concerned Mike, so he joined the game. When Mike was trying to get through to Nick it wasn't working. He tried telling Nick about all the memories they had it didn't work. So Nick ends up shooting himself in his head.",

More than the horror of war alone, the current crop of films about Vietnam depicts the conflict as an exercise in futility.

In ""Thunderbolt & Lightfoot"" director Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter,"" with Robert De Niro, three young Americans volunteer for the adventure of combat in Southeast Asia in the late 1960s as an alternative to the humdrum oblivion of life in a Northern mill town.

291,14 December 2001,jacob rosen,9, Comes Close,"Michael Cimino's ambitious goal of creating an epic about the impact of the Vietnam War on ordinary civilians falls a little short of its goal--Cimino's attempts at creating mythology through his characters doesn't have as much substance as it would appear on the surface and a lot of the moments aimed at reflection seem empty; on a larger scale, there might be some trouble understanding what it all means. But when Cimino concentrates on the smaller, intimate interpersonal relationships--of which there are many--he succeeds brilliantly and the anguish of the war's aftereffects are clear, keenly felt and far more engrossing. Robert DeNiro heads an ensemble cast that includes Meryl Streep, John Heard, Christopher Walken and the sorely missed John Cazale; they do justice to the script (by Cimino and three other writers) even when it shows its limitations. The middle section is a justly celebrated Russian roulette game played in a makeshift POW camp; while it underscores the unfortunate aspects of the screenplay, it is a harrowing experience that makes the performances that much more powerful. It could have been shorter but it is still a worthwhile experience, if not quite the masterpiece it was intended to be.",

It's not really about the war; it's unconcerned as to whether the conflict was right, wrong or somewhere in-between. Instead, it's about the soldiers. It spends its time exploring what happens to a person when they go to war, when they see their friends die and are forced to kill to survive, and how they readjust when - or, rather, if - they return to the apparent normalcy of everyday life. Even though the picture is undeniably rather slow, its overall effect is undeniably rather powerful. It stays with you. It's a showcase of acting, writing and directing that owes a huge debt to 'The Godfather (1972)' but isn't just a copy of it. It's a realistic, affecting portrayal of war-time trauma that's as successful in its quieter contemplation as it is in its unbearable tension. 7/10",

Whatever you wish to say about the senselessness of war, the Vietnam war especially, is captured by the random cruelty and striking brutality of the roulette scenes. It simply works to dramatize the existential dread veterans must feel. Unfortunately, it also dehumanizes the Viet Cong and simplifies the war into a good vs. evil struggle. More to the point, much of the rest of the film has an easy naturalism to it that stands apart from the roulette scenes. One could argue war should stand apart from everyday life but the film includes other operatic touches. Whether it is a few drops of wine split, deer, or the sun dogs the film has just enough of these things to think the roulette scenes were meant to be a tonal extension of the domestic scenes.

315,22 November 2006,ianlouisiana,10, Explores the bounds of friendship and community as none since.,"Mr Robert de Niro is often mooted as the greatest movie actor in America if not the world.Well,not on recent form he isn't.He may well be one of the most omnipresent movie actors in the world,but that isn't quite the same thing.There is a whole generation of moviegoers who have grown up since he last gave a performance that wasn't redolent of over-ripe ham. To them let me introduce ""The Deer Hunter"".Not the DVD with its superfluous ""extras"",not the video with its flickering images and muddy soundtrack,but the movie.In all its widescreen,stereophonic sound all - enveloping glory.Make no mistake,the cinema is the only possible place to fully appreciate Mr Michael Cimino's masterpiece.This isn't some overblown TV mini-series designed to be absorbed in 15 minute bites between adverts for dog food or MacDonalds(there's a difference?). ""The Deer Hunter"" is serious movie - making,requiring the viewer to exercise his or her full attention for a little over three hours. Perhaps the present generation find themselves unable to turn their mobile phones off for that long;certainly many contributors to this site seem unwilling or unable to make the effort to give TDH their full attention for all its 182 minutes.Possibly they'd be happier if Picasso had made ""Guernica"" a lot smaller so it didn't take so much time to look at. TDH is a movie about love and friendship.It's about an immigrant community engaged in the intricate process of retaining its ethnic identity whilst assuming that of its host nation.It's about loyalty,loss and the resilience of the human spirit.And some of it is about war.It happens to be the war in Vietnam,but it could be any war. Soldiers die,get crippled,become traumatised,be it Vietnam,Europe or Iraq. If the Russians had made TDH it would have been hailed as a great humanitarian document - another ""The cranes are flying"".But it was made by the Americans whose capacity for self - hatred is exceeded only by that of the British,and was duly trashed by many so-called intellectuals and opinion-makers,all wracked with fashionable guilt. The only salvageable asset in the movie was adjudged to be Mr de Niro's performance.Denigrators and admirers of the movie alike were united in their admiration for his portrayal of Michael (Cimino?),the charismatic slightly aloof natural leader of the group of young men who willingly go off to war,seeing it as their duty to their community and their community's unspoken obligation to the country that took them in. Michael is a strong-minded moral man imbued with the values of both the Old Country and the new one.A Frontiersman born a hundred years too late perhaps.In the sort of role Mr Gary Cooper might have played thirty years earlier,Mr de Niro is truly inspired.Only as the deeply unlikeable Jake La Motta was he ever near to this level of performance again.",

May I remind you before I continue my review, this movie is a three hour epic. So with that that in mind those who have short attention spans, it's never too late to turn away now, but if those who can sit through the slow, progressive pace with patience and perseverance, this is truly a treasured movie for the ages. Back in the late 1970's there have been an influx of epic movies that went past the three hour mark. Even though the movie caters to a general audience, it's really not custom-made for everyone to enjoy. It has a cornucopia of genres thrown into the story like romance, drama, mystery, horror and most of all the triumphs and turmoil of the Vietnam War that was still haunting the United States even though the war ended three years before ""The Deer Hunter"" was released. Sure the facets of the film was centred around the concept of friendship, it also gave an insight of the Vietnam War and the physical and mental harm it affected the soldiers who fought in this war.",

The movie took the long way in planting the pre-war lives into the audiences' minds, that the contrast in the post-war only need a few sequences to make. The war scenes are also greatly done. This feels somewhat special since the movie doesn't depict much on the war side. Yet the movie succeeded in exploiting the more dangerous side of war, the psychological side of it. The whole psychological game of the Russian roulette gets to be the nice metaphor, getting repeated several times along the movie. The acting overall is just great. Robert DeNiro did great in applying the the right level of his role's emotions. Christopher Walken balanced DeNiro's work perfectly, pulling the audience into the their characters' relationship. Meryl Streep did well in putting live in the state-side sequences.",

321,16 September 2011,Chase_Witherspoon,9, This is this ...,"Difficult to encapsulate a three-hour epic which essentially essays two divergent genres; the first hour a drama that establishes the characters as relatively care-free steel-workers in Pensylvania, bonding as deer hunters in their spare time, who volunteer to tour Vietnam, a decision that results in catastrophic consequences for each in different ways. The next hour is a war zone; captured by the enemy, and forced to engage in Russian Roulette, their experience manifests differently in each character - Savage virtually disintegrates, Walken is left battle-scarred and eventually drug-addled, while the once outgoing DeNiro emerges as the most intact.",
322,31 October 2016,qeter,7, very huge problem with this one,"Seen at the Viennale 2016: The movie was screened in one of the oldest cinemas, the Metro in Vienna. We were lucky to see an old 35 mm copy. It is always interesting to see older movies on the big screen, especially in their original analog way. You can see the history with all the scratches and partly changed colors. At the same time you see paintings of the past. At the beginning we see some sort of steel mill. The colors and shades of the fire - up to today only analog film material can produce such a beautiful image of fire. Look at Meryl Streep in her first scene. All the freshness of her youth is underlined by the painting art of exposed celluloid. What a cast! What a director! And partly, what a script! If I could rate this movie at parts: 10 for the nearly one hour long marriage and wedding party, 10 for the first and the second deer hunting, 10 for all the scenes in the home village, 10 for the scenes between De Niro and Streep, 10 for the playing of Walken, 10 for the final scene, 10 for everything, but not for the pictures of the war. Sadly, the Viet Cong fighters were shown as brutal sadists only. Sadly, the script writers included this unnecessary Russian roulette as key element. Because, this is such an important anti-war movie these mistakes are inexcusable. Too many people get a wrong picture of history due to these unnecessary historical (partly racist) untruths. It is a pity, because otherwise this movie would be one of the few perfect movies in history.",

Probably because I was so into Sci-Fi and Horror that this just didn't seem appealing to me at all. About 13 years after it's release, I rented it and fell asleep during it.  I never got a chance to see it all the way thru. I had to have the tape back before I had a chance to finish it.  I recently purchased it on DVD because of what little I remembered of it years ago and because I fell asleep during its first viewing.  I just watched it on DVD..... and again, I almost fell asleep.  DiNiro was great, as usual and so was Streep. I would never say this movie ""sucked"" or was bad but I have to say, it seemed SO slow to me.  I mean, an hour of footage at the wedding was just too much.  I really don't see what the fuss was all about.  Maybe if I had viewed it during the year of its release, I may think differently about it now.  But that's just my 2 cents worth.  I hope I haven't offended anyone.",

Casting future Oscar-winners Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep along with many others, he created a film based on the horrors of the Vietnam War. But what I mostly love about ""The Deer Hunter"" is that it takes on a different kind of perspective than most Vietnam War films do.

It must have been the combination of knowing that this was John Cazale's last movie (I'm a big Godfather trilogy fan too), the fact that he was dying of cancer throughout it, and of course the tragic ending, made this an extremely emotional experience. Definitely Walken's best, and possibly De Niro's best (Maybe tied for first with like 10 others!). I'll remember De Niro's performance and dialogue for as long as I live. (""This... is this!"")

I went to see it for myself and could see why they were so affected. It definitely is a dark and depressing movie. Very little comic relief. This film went head to head with another anti-Vietnam movie, Coming Home, for the 1978 Academy Awards. The two films together received 17 nominations and got five wins. Deer Hunter beat out Coming Home with nine nominations and five including the big one for Best Picture. Michael Cimino won for Best Director and was nominated for Best Screenplay in only his second directorial film who as a screenwriter before Deer Hunter he had success with Silent Running and Magnum force. Christopher Walken won for Best Supporting Actor in a role that would help define his career. Best Editing went to Peter Zimmer who had edited Godfather I and II and In Cold Blood among his many films. The film's fifth Oscar was for Best Sound. Rober De Niro was nominated for Best Actor and probably should have won but lost out to John Voight in Coming Home. Meryl Streep was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and Vilmos Zsigmond was nominated for Best Cinematography. Zsigmond photographed a string of big films in the 70's including Deliverence, Cinderella Liberty, MdCabe and Mrs. Miller and Sugarland Express and was a strong contender for the Oscar for his work on Deer Hunter. This film starts with a wedding and ends with a funeral with the Vietnam War in Between. It's opening is meant to build the characters but is far too long. A lot of the film is so implausible that's it hard to get ignore. lot's of violence here in it's depiction of events that are historically inaccurate that brings fabling to the story. Also in the cast are John Cazale in his last film and John Savage. This film has a lot going for it but I've passed on it many times over the years when it's come on television. It's good film-making with a strong cast but not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.",

The one thing I really liked about the Deer Hunter was the bond and obligation that soldiers have for one and other and I feel that no other movie has accomplished that quite like Deer Hunter. Go into it with that perspective and it's like no other movie about war that has ever been made.",

You can't fault the first Russian roulette scene - just a great summary of what war probably feels like, making it hit closer to home and feel more real than any battle scene ever could.

348,17 September 2000,molotov85,8, Horrifyingly boring,"For a film that was made twenty two years ago(1978) you'd think that with the growing graphic intensity of films this would be a lame, weak film. If I take an example of a recent war movie, say Saving Private Ryan, yes it is more gory (much, much more gory : think the D-Day Landing scenes) but is it more horrifying and unsettling for it? No. Simple as that : no. The Russian roulette scenes although they take up quite a major part of the story and are shown frequently still shock, horrify and with the voluntary 'RR' scenes dismay. Russian roulette is a 'game' in which a six-shooter is loaded with one bullet and then the chamber is spun and slammed in, so you don't know where the bullet is. You then hold the gun up to your head, pull the trigger and hope. In the Vietcong concentration camps where they are being held captive they are made to play this for the purpose of amusement and for gambling purposes. The sight of grown men being reduced to crying and shaking is simply terrible especially when you know that if you don't do it you are put in the 'cage' (a bamboo cage held in water with about two inches of breathing space left, which presumably when the waters rise, drowns you). It is the concentration camp scenes where one of the films almost fatal flaws comes to light. How did they get there? How did De Niro get from deer hunting to Vietnam on his own? How did his friends in a helicopter find him? How did they then get from there to a concentration camp? How did De Niro find his way through the forest, with a disabled man on his back, to a main road? How did Walken remember his disabled friend enough to send him money yet couldn't recognise De Niro? What were they saying at the beginning? Why does the film have to be so long? The film is an epic at around about three hours but you get the feeling with all of these gaping plot holes it was cut down from five hours! The wedding scenes, which took up an enormous chunk of the movie, bored and didn't seem to get anywhere in terms of anything. The Godfather's wedding scenes were great - there was enough going on to keep you attention, some of the films greatest moments occurred there (the 'My Father made him an offer he couldn't refuse' speech deserves to go down in film's history), the scene was set beautifully and the characters were introduced brilliantly like you knew them personally. The Deer Hunter's wedding scenes did none of this, bar a quite good pre-wedding bar scene involving the song 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You', the characters developed slightly but couldn't they do this in ten minutes and then jump to the deer hunting scenes? The dialogue may have left a bit to be desired as well. I put 'may' though as I couldn't hear it most of the time as what is supposed to be background music was made foreground music with the speaking taking a back seat. I appreciate that it was loud there and it was hard to make yourself heard but the person that they were speaking was right next to them and I don't make a habit of standing next to my telly so I couldn't hear what they were talking about! Turning the volume didn't help as that just made the music louder! I have knocked this quite a bit haven't I? So I wouldn't give it a good mark, right? Wrong. I think this is a brilliant film although it has shortcomings I forgive them all for Walken and De Niro's last frenzied scene, which is perhaps the most powerful, brilliant and shocking scene ever! If you are prepared to spend three hours, some of which tedious, you will come out of the cinema or living room feeling like you have just seen a very, very good film in spite of everything.",

In the Russian roulette that the POW's were forced to play, there was one bullet in the gun and they had to shoot themselves and hope they didn't kill themselves. The idea of Russian roulette is similar to the Vietnam War because soldiers in the war only came home with a couple of options; The soldiers either died in the war or were psychologically scarred for the rest of their life. This is a similar concept to that of Russian roulette because if you survive Russian roulette you may struggle with psychological problems for a long time.

Acting needless to say is high class and not just from ever formidable De Niro but from other cast too but worth mentioning here is Christopher Walken in one of his best roles ever and he totally deserved the Oscar for that part. I can't believe other filmmakers failed to utilize his talent in much deserved bigger and challenging roles throughout his illustrious career. Nonetheless De Niro's and Walken's performances are one for the ages. Direction by Michael Cimino is excellent and I read in some other reviewers comment, him being a one movie wonder and me too haven't heard about him for any other movies, but will definitely try to catch his other work to conclude. There are many reasons for why I loved this movie, some of them being: 1. the introduction sequences for all the characters and their lives which takes about one hour of the movie time and sets the right mood for the later parts of the movie. 2. Deer hunting scene 3. Less importance to the war sequences but rather to the psyche of the soldiers. 4. Russian roulette sequences, 5. Ending sequence where everyone gathers around the table, and many more scenes that keep with the pace of the movie. Overall I would say 3 hrs well spent on the weekend.",

It's about the loss of innocence and how it has a profound effect on your life. It's similar to previous Best Picture Oscar winners such as ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" and ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" in the sense that it has a clear message about the psychological impact and toll a war takes on a soldier's life when they transition back into civilian life. But whereas ""Western Front"" had more of an overarching political message, and ""Best Years"" had more of a homefront aesthetic, ""The Deer Hunter"" seems more like a bridge between the two. Obviously by 1978 the majority of Americans, even the most staunchly anti-communist, had seen the futility of the country's involvement in Vietnam.",

Who won that war is no longer important, but the effect that war has to this day is beyond devastating. In what is easily the best and last significant film of his career, director Michael Cimino delivers a film with a prophetic vision just three years after the war ended, and is the first in a string of Vietnam war movies that is still attempted over three decades on.Having also co-written the screenplay, Cimino's story does not entirely focus on battle scenes or the war itself, but in essence, its aftermath on the lives of ordinary people. For this, his narrative spans three hours, of which the first hour is spent in impeccable character development formally introducing his Russian-American characters in a small Pennsylvanian steel-mill suburb.",
364,28 February 2008,emperor_bender,8, Difficult to stay focused but still a very good film,"I had heard a lot about this movie, mainly negative things though. We even had a presentation in English class on the negative effects of cinema violence on society and they showed piece of this film to prove their point. After that, I just HAD to see this movie. I'm easily fooled that way, like when I heard Taxi Driver was an inspiration for Hinckley's assault on Reagan I went and rented it. Anyway, this film started off in a Godfather-type of style, wedding, characters showing their true colors and whatnot. Then it started to become its own film and from then on was excellent. I admit I lost track of the plot a few times in the movie (mainly because I have ADD), but I liked it over all. The story was very original and very bold. Michael Cimino had to have guts to direct such a controversial film as this. Everything was very realistic. Especially the extra-controversial Russian-roulette scenes. I heard at least 70 deaths were attributed to this film but I do not think that they were INSPIRED by the film. The movie wasn't meant to be INSPIRING just....well...raw. The story was great though. The characters were very good as well: Michael Vronsky (Robert DeNiro), Stanley/Stosh (John Cazale), Steven (John Savage), Nick Chevotarevich (Christopher Walken), Linda (Meryl Streep), Axel (Chuck Aspegren), and John (George Dzundza). I was sad to learn John Cazale died after making this film, he was very good here, as Sal in Dog Day Afternoon, and of course as Fredo Corleone in The Godfather Part I&II. However I must give him credit, he pushed himself to finish this film. This movie is a true classic and will make you think after you watch it.

Firstly what becomes apparent is the look of the film, every shot (and I mean every shot) looks stunning and secondly the quality of the acting is immense and so very real it is difficult to watch at times, both in its gore but also in its awkwardness and pained conversations throughout. It's not all good, the stock footage of Vietnam does jar a little and parts of the films narrative appear to jump with out reason. The soldiers capture by the Vietcong being the obvious example. That said Robert DeNiro is simply stunning and he is the coolest dude ever in this movie. A wonderful movie in the purest sense and although it is traditionally classed as a war film, half of the movie if not more is set in America away from Vietnam the film is a wonderful sturdy of friends and friendships and the impact of war both on the body and thd mind and what we lose because of it.

383,21 April 2008,OldAle1,6, overwrought epic of Vietnam and the homefront,"Vilmos Zgismond's cinematography is the best thing about this overwrought, overlong male-posturing saga. In the beginning, the accents and locations ring false -- if this is supposed to be realistic, it doesn't work as the huge cathedral where the wedding takes place clearly doesn't belong to small-town coal-mining PA anymore than the deer-hunting sequences obviously shot in the Rockies do. Had the film seemed more naturalistic or expressionistic, this wouldn't have bothered me but instead it seemed like a situation where director and writer did their homework, then just threw away what they didn't like. The wedding sequence was intolerably long and pointless; the Vietnam sequence harrowing but disturbing as much for being devoid of any political context as it was for the horror of what was going on. I found it fantastic that there is virtually no discussion in the film of the morality of the war -- not whether the characters or filmmakers are for or against, but that they show almost no opinion -- what's on screen certainly shows us something of the damaging effects of conflict, but it could be any war. Perhaps that was intentional, but to me the tension between this heightened reality (Vietnam is all wars) and the more mundane elements just didn't work, and I couldn't tell if it was intentional. I liked the sequences of DeNiro coming home and readjusting the best, and his was for me the richest and deepest performance, and character.

398,4 December 2016,cdjh-81125,9, Not A War Film But A Character Piece,"At first glance Michael Ciminos, ""The Deer Hunter"" would appear to be a war film but it's not really like this it's really about a friendship that is torn apart by the Vietnam War and this makes this film a much more compelling film to view and a damn good one at that. I loved The Deer Hunter mainly because of its characters and how the film takes the time to build them up. This film uses its extremely long run time to its advantage, so that it can fully take the time to explore its characters and how their experiences effect them. The friendship in this movie is a believable one, they feel genuine because that do things that real friends do, they argue and make fun of each other but ultimately respect one and other and that makes the characters seem more relatable in the eyes of the audience. Robert DeNiro is fantastic in this film, De Niro pulls of his character with style he makes him a wounded soul but one that is still loyal I could not have seen anyone else play this character. This is easily Christopher Walkens best performance because he gives such a genuine performance in all aspects of his character when it comes to his likable and childish character but also his traumatised persona that is made very believable through the films fantastic writing. Meryl Streep was really good in this film I do have a few issues with her character that I will elaborate on. Now this film doesn't have many action sequences but when they come they are extremely brutal and realistic because of the time Cimino took to build the stakes of them and the Russian roulette sequences are incredibly intense and extremely well directed. This film has an excellent way of analysing the effects of war of its characters you get the idea that they don't want to be viewed as heroes and I loved the last act of the movie that explores this idea. I suppose my biggest issue with this film is the eventual romance that blooms between De Niro and Streets characters and it's mainly because I didn't feel any kind of chemistry between them and unlike other aspects of this film such as the central friendship and the war sequences it just didn't feel genuine and was extremely forced.

401,6 April 2007,Camoo,9, Flawed but Powerful Masterpiece,"There is no doubting that is a great film, a monument to a tremendous amount of work and care, a showcase for some of the best actors in a generation, and stunning cinematography. And it was John Cazale's last film, a brilliant ending to a short but incredible career. It won many awards, fixed the director a place in history (and possibly enough power to never have to work in this capacity again), and has gone down in history as one of the greatest films of all time. But it is a flawed masterpiece, as much as those flaws don't ultimately matter when surrounded with such mastery, I couldn't help but notice them on my last viewing. The unconvincing and jarring mid-section surrounding the classic scene with Christopher Walken playing Russian roulette seemed stapled together, from when DeNiro returned to the States, only to return to Saigon and find Walkin's character with such ease and join him at the roulette table. Somehow this seemed forced... But, well there is not much else. The scenes in Vietnam are some of the most realistic and disturbing images ever burned to celluloid, however the Asians in the film come off stereotyped into typical enemy roles (Cimino was later criticized for stereotyping Chinese in his film 'the Year of the Dragon' - apparently he doesn't learn well!), but I suppose thats missing the point- the film is about brotherhood, war, peace, love, devotion, and patriotism. I preferred this to 'Apocalypse Now', another epic Vietnam film by a director who was in no way involved in Vietnam...",
402,28 March 2002,LuboLarsson,10, De Niro at his peak,"The Deer Hunter is a very powerful and haunting film, with images and scenes that will stay with you long after you have finished watching it. Robert De Niro puts in arguably his finest performance. This was made at a time when he wouldn't appear in just any old film, and he seemed to have a knack of picking classic films to appear in. It would be unfair to expect every role an actor played to be a classic, but to be honest the Robert De Niro of today seems a million miles away rom the Robert De Niro that appears in The Deer Hunter. Everyone thinks of the Russian roulette scene when they think of this film, and its probably be mentioned in most of the comments here, but I don't think I've seen a more powerful, amazing and realistic performance than what De Niro does in this scene, he's quite simply bloody fantastic, what an actor. Also of course this wasn't a one man show, Christopher Walken deservedly won an oscar for his role here. Meryl Streep is brilliant, actually the whole cast are. Sadly this was John Cazale's last perforance, he died shortly after filming, at least he left us with this last great appearance in film. The director Michael Cimino made an amazing film here and its baffling he's never come close to making a decent film since. Robert De Niro, you're simply the best. *** 10/10 ***",

404,11 April 2007,film_riot,7, The Deer Hunter,"""The Deer Hunter"" is a classic, its film artistry is stunning on the technical and the acting side. Screenwriter Deric Washburn knows how to create real characters and he knows how to introduce us to their inner life with tiny details. But still, the film doesn't really work for me. I appreciate the basic idea behind it. I think the decision to spend this big amount of time letting the audience get to know their characters is brilliant. So the first hour is the one that works masterly for me. But also the final hour, with the boys coming back from Vietnam (or not, as in Nick's case), is crafted well. So, what works in Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter"" is the character drama that shows us the consequences of this war for the individuals and as a result of that for the group. What doesn't work is the middle part in Vietnam. The Russian Roulette is terrifying but doesn't fit into this context. And to show the Vietcong as inhuman beasts with no human feelings makes it even worse.",

Christopher Walken's performance was voted in Premiere Magazine's top 100 performances of all time as No. 88 and it certainly deserves it's high ranking. Meryl Streep does a truly fine job too playing the naive and simple suburban girl in love with Nick (Walken's character).,
406,6 September 2005,movieman-200,7, Still Too Long But Better Looking Transfer This Time Around,"Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter (1978) is perhaps the most aggressively critical and monumental critique of the Vietnam experience ever put on film. The story is a frank, brooding and foreboding deconstruction of lives plunged into the horrors of war. Michael (Robert DeNiro) is an honorable loner who doesn't perceive much to be admired from his life as a Pennsylvanian steel mill worker. His one ray of sunshine in an otherwise dismal and inescapable future is Linda (Meryl Streep). She is seemingly pledged in marriage to Nick (Christopher Walken)  if only he'd realize it and ask her to marry him. But Nick is a hot shot first and a lover second. Knowing full well that Linda will wait for Nick, presumably forever, Michael keeps an honorable distance from his own foolish romantic fancies. He also plays big brother to naïve Steven (John Savage), the youngster of their motley crew that includes boorish, John (George Dzundza), laconic Axel (Chuck Aspengren) and meddling Stanley (John Cazale). Indulged by misguided patriotism Nick, Michael and Steven go off to Vietnam shortly after Steven marries his beloved, the pregnant Angela (Rutanya Alda). They are captured by the Vietcong, brought to a prison camp and forced to play Russian roulette against each other. And although Michael's quick thinking affords them the opportunity to temporarily escape, they are soon separated once more  and arguably forever ripped from the binding mindset that once united them. Cimino (whose critical misfire on Heaven's Gate would effectively end his all too brief directorial supremacy in Hollywood), labors intensely on this film and at an excruciatingly slow pace. Indulging is every whim in very long takes (and for that matter, scenes) the story is told around four pivotal events in these character's lives: Steven's wedding, the deer hunt, the nail biting roulette game and Nick's death and aftermath. Clearly, the film is an opus magnum of self-indulgence for the director  shot sometimes in an almost documentary style (as are the opening scenes in the steel mill or the evacuation of Saigon, that actually employs news reel footage to help fill in the blanks). Yet Cinimo has forgotten a fundamental of film making: that economy of the shot is usually best to appeal to the tastes of a wide audience base. For those who are first time viewers more attuned to contemporary editing style this film is a decided change of pace. It refrains from tedious exposition but replaces dialogue with stagnancy of the narrative. Hence, The Deer Hunter is NOT for everyone  even in 1978. But as time rolls on it seems to narrow its fan base considerably. At 3hrs. 9 min. it is apt to put many to sleep.",

It is certainly one of the most powerful films I have seen. While this movie is looked upon as a war movie I think it is much more than that, I think it is a character study of how war affects people, not just the people involved in the war but their families also. There are moments in this film that I will never forget, like the absolutely terrifying russian roulette scene, if you think about the situation the characters are in it is very terrifying.

Directed with accurately and realism by Michael Cimino,  ""The Deer Hunter"" is a  faithful portrait of the sequels that a war leaves marked in the soldiers, and, more than that, this movies denounces the disdain that sometimes the society has for them . In the excellent cast, the actor Cristopher Walken gives the best performance of his career.

410,30 September 2013,blazesnakes9,10, The Deer Hunter is the best film of 1978,"In 1975, America was leaving Vietnam as the communist Southeast Asia country fell under communist control. Hollywood at the time had already made a Vietnam movie and that film was John Wayne's The Green Berets. That film became the first pro-war film about the Vietnam War. In other words, the war is good. Well, that didn't fit well with the critics. Critics in that time in 1968 wanted a serious movie about the Vietnam War. It wasn't till 1978, about 10 years later, that Hollywood made the first anti-war about the Vietnam War. That film is, of course, was The Deer Hunter. It told the story about three Pennsylvania steel-workers who are having the time of their lives. Among the ordinary jobs they have, they also have a wedding before they are send to Vietnam to fight. The three men are played, very through and very strong, by Robert De Niro, John Savage and Christopher Walken, who won a Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The three men leave the USA to go to Vietnam. They had no idea what kind of physical and mental destruction awaits them. The three men are forced to play Russian Roulette in a Vietcong hut. They have to survive the war and their aftermath. But, tragedy strikes and changes their lives, forever. As I said before, The Deer Hunter, has a lot of great performances by the three leading men and also, Meryl Streep, who is so effective as the role, Linda. The Deer Hunter took home 5 Oscars, including Best Picture. I felt that the movie works on character development. And, when we see the aftermath of the war, we see the aftermath of the three men. Director Michael Cimino tells this tale of war very thoroughly. Even though it runs 3 hours, it never runs out of steam. And even in the Russian Roulette scene, I felt so choked up that I felt like someone was strangling me. The suspense of that scene put me on edge. There's no doubt in my mind that The Deer Hunter is the best film of 1978. After The Deer Hunter, other great Vietnam movies came along. Movies like Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July and Platoon followed. And even when The Deer Hunter was released in 1978,other films told different tales about the war. Go Tell the Spartans was another film that dealt with the topic of the Vietnam War. The Deer Hunter is a shattering, heroic and deeply effective war drama. ★★★★ 4 stars.",

413,27 December 2008,eastbergholt2002,7, Film about malaise in 1970s America,I recently watched the Deer Hunter for the first time in 30 years. Back in the late 1970s people were trying to make sense of what happened in Vietnam and the Deer Hunter was one of a number of films that offered an insight into the war. It won five Oscars including Best Picture and became a powerful indictment of Vietnam. The film focused on ordinary working class draftees and presented a horrific view of the war. The film entered the mainstream and helped convince most people that Vietnam was a tragic mistake. It also played a role in persuading middle America that fighting wars in foreign countries should be avoided. Many of the film's most shocking scenes now seem dishonest and manipulative. There is also an underlying subtext of self-loathing and pessimism permeating the film which probably reflects the post-Watergate mood in 1978. These days it all seems strange and depressing.,

There is no character development and not that much character revelation. The time sequence makes no sense in terms of what is omitted except for the cut to the next intense scene, however improbable the sequence. Because the intensity is pointless, it is boring. The hunting scenes are a farce -- trust me, there are no deer in mountain goat territory. There are 20 seconds of re-watchable violence. Apparently, it was always winter in Pennsylvania back in those days. The 'Russian-American culture' wedding scene was fun. The only likable character is a bartender.",
425,11 August 2006,bugleboy5,9, One shot.,"One of the most in-depth psychological depictions of Vietnam war; before, during, and after. This film shows the life of those from a town in Pennsylvania and the effect the war has had on their lives. It is hard to choose this film over some other very great Vietnam war movies, or any war movie in general. It is comparable to ""Apocalypse Now"", and ""Platoon"", but is still a whole different type of Vietnam war film. Definitely worth seeing and owning. One of my favorite movies of all time. Robert DeNiro is superb, as per usual, and the story line is excellent. One shot, that is all it takes. One shot is all it takes to change everything forever.",
426,2 August 1999,Deckard-16,10, An almost too-powerful and wrenching drama.,"There are a handful of truly excellent movies that I only want to experience once and this is one of them. Michael Cimino's sweeping portrait of men drafted into war to commit atrocities against other men is harrowing. The survivors suffer more than the dead. I know a lot of knee-jerk liberals read a lot of jingoistic patriotism into Cimino's script especially when the movie ended with singing of the Star Spangled Banner (or another ""patriotic"" song), but I saw it as a ironic, if not sardonic, touch. This film could have been set in any war. I didn't see it as being specifically about Vietnam and thus the hotly debated use of Russian Roulette throughout the movie was an extremely effective metaphor rather than an historical fact or fiction. (I could care less whether it actually was used as a torture technique or not --all I know is that is moved me to the depths of my soul.)I was moved to tears by it. And of course the acting was brilliant. DeNiro gives one of best performances ever (and that is saying a lot) and he is matched by an excellent supporting cast. But as powerful as DeNiro is who can ever forget Christopher Walken's shattering performance in his Oscar winning role? The effect that Man's capacity for inhumanity had on him and everybody else was as tough to to watch as anything in movie history. His death was real shocker (in a very bad sense) and I don't even like remembering it as I write this. The Deerhunter is easily one of the top 20 films I've ever seen and is probably a top 10 pick. Its Oscars were richly deserved.",

Midnight Express is a much better film and it lost to this film that looked like it was edited by a 15 year old. I found it ironic that it won an Academy Award for sound. I had to turn on the subtitles so I could understand what the actors were saying. I feel this won best picture because of the popularity of De Niro.,

430,27 April 2014,ohthatgigi,10, i love you bay-bie!,"Without conflating the movie itself to a higher cause of anti violence and caustic tirade of American's reckless and disproportionate decision of Vietnam war, I think deer hunter is The most well-made war movie I've ever seen, for its sheer richness of emotional depiction of each character in the movie, which further correlated to the audience and induce psycal analysis which transcends the movie in every possible way. One thing about war genre is that director can be obsessed with the infeasible idea of depicting the cruelty of as many people as possible, but deer hunter has no such ambition, it simply tells us a story between three blue-collar workers' life, totally changed by the harrowing war. But the pain is self explanatory, it is simply out there that we automatically internalize it without the necessity of the movie itself conflating it to the dark nature of humanity and warfare.",

The side of the good we're always good and justified, and the side of the bad the opposite. When I saw this film I did not speak for 3 days afterwards. And I was a talkative individual!

438,3 April 2019,xmdbx,8, A Different Type of War Movie,"The Deer Hunter is a different war film than most. There aren't any battles or last stands or any of the typical war games. Instead, it is a look at the people involved and a look into a particular piece of culture associated with the Vietnam War. Clocking in at over 3 hours, this felt like a long movie to me. Parts of it were overlong (like all the pre-deployment stuff, particularly the wedding) and other parts were long enough to get the viewer understand the gravity of the situations that are unfolding on screen. The length of the film worked both for and against it. There is some cheesiness that I didn't enjoy like the random breaks into song, specifically the ""God Bless America"" at the end came off a little too propaganda-ish for me. However, what carries the film is the psychological effects the war has on the characters and how compelling the Russian Roulette scenes are. Both of these are mostly products of the actors. De Niro, Walken and some of the Vietnamese characters are fantastic. The decision to focus on Russian Roulette is also an interesting one because it's one of the only things that can compare to war in terms of limits of the human experience. The stakes are so high already but when it's put on top of war it becomes something else entirely. The climax of the film is one of the darkest that I have seen. There is also something to be said that this film was made not when Vietnam was a memory like most films we know but instead while it was still a relatively fresh scar on the American populace.",
439,20 July 2005,crzyjeb84,9, More than just a War Movie,"When I saw this film I thought that it was a movie just about the Vietnam conflict. I was wrong. The film is about how the Vietnamn War affected those who fought in it. It shows how even if you were not killed or wounded you came back a different person. It was truly one of the Best films of the 1970's. It deservingly won 5 Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director. The film also had a incredible cast featuring break through performances from Christopher Walken as Nick, and Meryl Streep as Linda. Also not to mention a Great performance from Robert De Niro as Micheal. Another Performance which is sadly forgotten is that of John Cazale who died shortly after the film was finished.

440,17 November 2010,mrspasm,10, One For The Fearmongers,"The second World War II was a terrible time for the US. Thankfully this film follows the more enjoyable Viet Kong War, where Robert Mitchum, Christopher Biggins, Fredo, and Diane Keaton find their small town lives disrupted by invading bad guys. They like to spend their weekends hunting harmless animals and drinking Bud but this peace is disturbed when the tables are ironically turned and they become the hunted. They hide in the jungle for a while and meet a young group of teens called the Wolverines who are also hiding out. This young group includes various Shat Pack members- Rob Lowe, Michael J Keaton, Emilio Eckhart, Patrick Swayze, and Baby. The kids have hunting rifles too and decide to wage war on the Vietnamese who have enslaved their village, but they need a distraction. De Matteo, Biggins, and co etc decide to flee and force the bad guys to follow them, giving the Wolfers enough time and freedom to free the city! Unfortunately Robbie, Chrissie, and Fredoie, are captured and pitted off against each other in a terrifying game of life and poker. 2 prisoners are picked at a time and given a deck of cards- each takes a card and whoever has the lower card gets shot with a knife while the bad guys, laugh, bet, and have a generally knee-slapping time. Our heroes have been watching this, understandably horrified, waiting for their turn. Bob De Bobbo and Baggins are pulled out for their turn, but luckily Bob gets his hands on a flame thrower and toasts the bad guys- toasts them good and quips 'You talking to me? Not anymore!' They get back to town to find that the Wolfies have chased the bad guys away and all is well, although there have been casualties- Swayze's mullet got trapped in a harvester he was driving and he was torn into confetti. Usefully though they used this confetti for the celebratory parade so it wasn't for nothing. Just when you think the film is ending though it takes a sinister turn; it turns out that Baggins has become addicted to the deadly card game which he names Park The Fleece, Master Flip, and has been running underground tournaments. When someone challenges him to a game (he has only been watching before this) he gladly accepts to prove he ain't chicken. Frodo and Nero hear about this and race to the rescue but only make it in time to see the knife penetrate their friend's brain, and watch him fall to the floor, deading. It seems the Deer have claimed their final victim.",
441,7 May 2012,jaktrip,1, A brave de Niro is not anti war,"War movies are in a dilemma. On the one hand, they need to show war as what it is: a hopeless and devastating human drama that many can't mentally survive if they were lucky enough to survive it physically. On the other hand, the watchers like action and bravery. These two things hardly match, because if you want to show the reality of war, there is not much space for superficial statements like ""trust me, I know what I'm doing"" or other showcases of bravery. And de Niro is shown just like that. He has a clear mind, does the right things, he has the plan how to shoot down the enemies that hold them captive (and what plan does he have? He wants to shoot down 5-10 Vietnamese that all watch him closely and are in the same room with ONE bullet hitting someone with a gun and then he can take the gun and finish the others off - yeah right, that certainly works out in most cases if it is real...). That is not war, that is Hollywood. End the enemies? The Vietnamese are shown as aggressive, simple-minded and perfidious people who love to play with the lives of men and who kill helpless women carrying children - while the US soldiers are like your neighbors or best friends. A little unbalanced? I think so. Definitely this movie is not going to help people get more tolerant towards different cultures (which I think is a necessity for reducing war). ",

It concerns a close-knit group of friends from a small Pennsylvania town who all work together in the steel mill. Robert De Niro is astonishing as Michael the natural leader of the group in a magnificent performance that earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, Christopher Walken is sensational as Michael's sensitive best friend Nick in a star-making performance that won him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and John Savage delivers an intensely effective performance as Steven the youngest member of the group who just married his pregnant girlfriend. They all proudly go to serve their country in the Vietnam War, totally unaware of the nightmarish horrors that await them in that brutal war. They are all captured and sent to riverside Vietcong prison camp where their sadistic captors make them play Russian roulette with each other as they bet money on which one of them will survive, these shocking scenes are some of the most excruciatingly disturbing ones ever filmed. Masterful Oscar winning direction by the late Cimino, with extraordinary supporting performances by Meryl Streep who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress in her film debut, and in his final screen role that late great character actor John Cazale delivers an impressive turn as their neurotic friend Stan. George Dzundza delivers a wonderfully amusing performance as John their giggling bar owner friend. Striking Oscar nominated cinematography by the legendary Vilmos Zsigmond. This now classic motion picture shows the incalculable damage that this awful war did not only to the soldier who were psychologically devastated by it, but also to the soul and conscience of America. ""The Deer Hunter"" swept most of the critics awards including the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Picture, and won 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director: Michael Cimino.

I grew up in a household where I was not allowed to watch Jane Fonda or watch Joan Baez when she sang on the Muppet Show. My dad was not a gung-ho warrior but instead, he never really spoke about Vietnam. This film defines the grim ironies of what it was to be an American in 1978. Our politicians led us down a tangled path of atrocities in Vietnam, Chile, Cambodia, and yes, even our own country. Ultimately, so many people's lives were destroyed in the process. The enduring friendship of these people in this film is the binding theme which is the ""heart"" of the story. However, each individual is forever changed by the Vietnam War. One loses his life, another his limbs and the third, his innocence. The rest of friends left behind in America are faced with a variety of bewildering circumstances.

The story of three steel mill workers who leave family and friends to go fight in Vietnam, become embroiled in the horrors of war and return to their Pennsylvania hometown in varying states of mental and physical breakdown seems more powerful now than when it first premiered in 1978. Perhaps the film's greatest strength is its uncanny ability to convey the everyday milieu of fictional Clairton, Pa. ; its depiction of blue collar workers, most of Russian descent who are closely tied to family and cultural tradition, who unswervingly believe in God and Country, may not appeal to the more Liberal audience. Indeed, the movie was castigated by many Vietnam Veterans as a false depiction of the times, a simple minded multimillion dollar action flick that reduced the Vietnam Conflict to a John Wayne -type polemic with nary a peace sign in sight. Director Cimino had always claimed that his film was a story of how war effects the ordinary man ; the fact that it took place in the Vietnam Era was incidental. With unstinting mastery Michael Cimino guides the viewer on a lengthy journey into the heart of darkness that was Vietnam ; how it broke the spirit of its fighting men and the devastating consequences the war had on those men when they returned home. THE DEER HUNTER is not a casebook study. It plays fast and loose with the facts, nowhere more apparent than in the horrific Russian Roulette sequences that dominate the middle and final third of the picture. These scenes , the first of which is set in a prisoner of war camp, are among the most harrowing ever filmed. As a display of action , violence and unbearable tension, it is a stupendous piece of film-making ; it is also cunningly manipulative. For a movie that covers such a large narrative canvas it is remarkable how the pace almost never flags. But THE DEER HUNTER does have an Achilles heel , and it is a serious one. With a screenplay by Derek Washburn and story contributions by Cimino and two other writers, the film is an incoherent mess. Dialogue tends toward the fragmented and clearly thought -out sentences are discarded when the trite and obvious will do. What goes a long way in saving the picture from disaster, in fact miraculously lifts the movie to another realm is the director's astonishing technical mastery. The great tragedy of Michael Cimino's career was that he was never able to speak as eloquently as he was able to visualize. He got away with it in THE DEER HUNTER because his crudely spoken story was enveloped in some of the most most atmospherically drenched, scenically stunning widescreen cinematography ever put on film. From the dark cavernous interior of an enormous Russian Orthodox Church to the outlying depressed steel mill town and the majestic snow covered mountains that surround it; the verdant greens of Vietnam and the blast of orange fire killing everything in its path; and the smoky, hellish interior behind a Saigon storefront, where the stakes are high and a friend's life lies in the balance. Adding immeasurably to the film's power is a superb cast, headed by Robert DeNiro as Michael, whose ""one shot "" code of ethics used in hunting deer becomes a metaphor for the entire movie. Also impressive are John Savage as a boyish bridegroom , John Cazale as a hot-headed drinking buddy and Meryl Streep as the girl who's left behind. But the most unforgettable performance is given by Christopher Walken who plays Nick, Michael's loyal, sensitive friend and hunting partner who becomes lost in the murk and mire of Vietnam. Walken 's portrait of a man scarred by life with eyes that seem half -dead will haunt you. The critical and popular success of THE DEER HUNTER emboldened Cimino to try his hand with an even bigger project for his next movie. But implanted in THE DEER HUNTER were the future seeds of destruction. HEAVEN'S GATE, released in 1980, was Michael Cimino's epic western of Wyoming's infamous Johnson County War. The new film had all the elements that distinguished THE DEER HUNTER : brilliant pictorial composition, stunning locales and riveting action sequences. It also had an unintelligible screenplay, one so inept that no amount of technical resources could hide it. A fine cast was lost in a sea of unfocused characterizations and unclear motivations. The result was an unqualified disaster that brought down a studio (United Artists) and stalled a promising career. Michael Cimino had an unparalleled gift for visual composition equaled perhaps only by David Lean and a few others. HEAVEN'S GATE is worth a look just for that fact alone. Profligate film-making is what got Michael Cimino in the end. But he is without doubt a born film director, and with THE DEER HUNTER he reached boldly, if perhaps imperfectly, for greatness.",

As both a disabled Vietnam Veteran and growing up in a New Jersey factory town with many people of Eastern European origins, the scenes were like a return home for me. These people were very patriotic and anti-communist. I was a student at Rutgers New Brunswick, NJ campus when anti-Vietnam War students clashed with the large anti-communist Hungarian population. Some of these people arrived after the 1956 Hungarian uprising. In the first hour the film depicts the the type of people that went to Vietnam, working class and in some cases patriotic.",
454,2 May 2023,jonny_,10, Easily my favourite war film.,"There's plenty to choose from, and at face value this is a war movie that opens with about an hour of friends hanging out and going to a wedding. Usually i'm not a big fan of what would seem like, a long winded character/world building spiel, but here it is so brilliantly done. In other films you would span a days/weeks/months, it wouldn't all come across naturally and spending a lot of your movie to do it? Normally it drags and you'd maybe still not know everything you need to about everyone.",
455,5 September 2001,cengelm,7, Russian Roulette with Predictable Outcome,"The film starts with the often used slice-of-life episode which introduces us to the characters. For my taste this part was about 20 minutes too long. Once arrived in Vietnam we learn how Russian Roulette is played. There wasn't much tension for me, though, because I always knew the outcome. DeNiro must go on with his show so he won't die. He's the usual ultracool guy who doesn't mind about life or death which unfortunately hurts the quality of the film. He travels to Saigon to get Nick out of the hell in the last minute possible. And then again he plays Russian Roulette where either he or Nick will certainly die. Will Nick be able to find his way home alone? Hardly. So it's better when HE dies. The Vietnamese are stereotype bad guys and lack any individuality. Overall I was disappointed after 3 hours. Good cast and technically well made.",
456,11 November 2008,hbdave_77,8, A saga of courage & freindship in Vietnam war,"The movie bagged 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture (Michael Cimino), Best Actor (Robert De Niro) & Best Supporting Actor (Christopher Walken) in 1978. Its definitely critically acclaimed, extraordinary, powerful film featuring a group of steelworker friends. The story takes turn towards their deer hunting grounds & gradually to lethal Vietnam War. Well the story turns to different trajectory once they signed for Vietnam War. Its compelling drama of friendship & courage among adversity, difference of personality & a shattering emotional experience. The film has strong casting with De Niro, Meryl Streep, John Cazale, & Christopher Walken in memorable roles. The only drawback which I found is its tad 3 hour length & with director's penchant for detail, some time film becomes so slow & boring especially in the first half which is wasted on long wedding ceremony for character development. But the second half is totally absorbing, dark & realistic. Watch out De Niro's mind blowing expressions in the scene on betting gun table where he & Walken were constantly slapped by Vietnamese soldiers or the scene where he ventured 12000 miles away to get Walken & he refused to identify him on gunning table once again. Sure give it one shot.",

Christopher Walken also gives a career defining and Oscar-winning performance as Michael's best friend Nick. The story is one of the best of this century. It follows a band of friends as half of them venture into the horrors of the Vietnam War. This then splits them up and changes them both physically and emotionally. Michael Cimino's brilliant direction and amazing story, coupled with some of the best acting ever, gave this film the resonance that it has received.

The portions of the movie that dealt with life in a Pennsylvania steel town were rich in character interaction, as well as setting (I could feel the cold of the town).  However, what really grabbed me the first time AND this time I saw it, was the depiction of the insanity that occurred in Vietnam.  This was the first movie that I ever saw that began to open my eyes as to the true horror and insanity of war. I say the movie was uncomfortably powerful because I found myself to be very tense throughout the war scenes of the movie.  Honestly, I wasn't able to imagine scenes as horrible until they were shown to me.  Once again, it gave me a new respect for those that have fought and withstood the horrors of any war.

468,22 January 2011,andy-933-696608,10, The Deer Hunter movie review,"In the time that I've observed this movie, it plays itself so beautifully that just the idea of watching it end is as sad as its story, and its tragic ending. ""The Deer Hunter"" is very different from most films. Aside from having some the best performances ever witnessed, the direction of both the films and its character's contribution to the film is like a play divided into acts. Act one centers around a group of Russian American Steel workers, Michael (Deniro), Nick (Walken) and Steven (Savage) all prepare for a journey that will change their lives, as much as those whom love them most. The setting is 1968, Clairton Pennsylvania, in the dark times of Vietnam. The film's leads are preparing for their service into Vietnam, enjoying their final days of fun and freedom with as much free spirit as any other day they went drinking, only to at some point lose that very spirit of hope at the wake of the dark times ahead. Aside from having the well talented leads, lets introduce the other members of this laid back, and almost family bonded group of friends. There's Axel (Aspegren) and his poetic ways of talking, Stan (Cazale) their womanizing, gun flinging nut, John (Welsh) their bartender, and Linda (Streep) Nick's girl. Just from seeing them sing so cheerfully in the bar, celebrating Stevens wedding to be, shows just how close this group is, and how devastating the very events to come will be. As many can remember, Vietnam was a Hell America never wishes to revisit. The damage done by Vietnam is well examined in the ""The Deer Hunter"", as it shows the effects of it's mental and social damages to so much more than just it's 3 leads. Michael and the gang prepare for quite a good bye, in their last Deer hunting trip, traveling up to the mountains. ""One Shot"" a quote made by the proud and very direct leader Michael. Michael character is both a likable, but on some occasions a very questionable guy, using a calm and serious attitude to motivate his actions through most of the film. He hunts deer with complete discipline, and he follows his friends with absolute loyalty. In the wake of the films second act, the Vietnam arc, we witness torture, inhumanities through the sadism of Russian Roulette, and even a mental penetration through the 3 friends, especially Nick, forever damaging their hopes of living a normal life. Michael comes back in one piece, Steven not so much, and Nick doesn't even come back home, using his pain and convinced belief of his friend's demise to bury his old life, and start a new, and only more tainted way of living. The 3rd and final act flows more nicely, as Michael's return home is explored with the typical mental anguish of all Vietnam vets, feeling not right in the head, as well as having a much more valuable understanding of life. With his one shot code, he misses his chance in hi latest chance at a deer. His bonding with Linda, grows even more, as his personal feeling for her become more open and more real, in the midst of their lips touching. Despite how charming the tone of the3rd act seemed it all came to end with the death of Nick. Upon discovering he was alive, Michael traveled to Saigon, hoping to keep his promise of never leaving him there, and bringing him home. His attempts at finding and returning Nick home are almost as chaotic as the images of the fall of Saigon. Nick's made quite name for himself in Russian Roulete, making the concept of gambling so much worth while in the eyes of the money grubbing monsters. As the American attraction, his state of mind is both cold and shattered, for upon his reunion with Michael, there is nothing. His memory is somewhere else, all caused by the drug abuse, and the very image war has caused for him. Michaels loyalty to his friend was strong enough to break through, but not enough to save him from what had already consumed him, or his friends war. ""The Deer Hunter"" is both a riveting exploration into the very damage done by war to both soldiers, and their surroundings. Director Michael Cimano gives each character something to have been affected by Vietnam. Michael no longer hunt deer, seeing the true nature of taking it's life, Nick couldn't even think right anymore that it drove him to running away and burying his old life in drug abuse and sadism. Steven's loss of his limbs affected both his marriage as well as his capabilities of talking to his wife. Basically Vietnam affected all of them. This whole group of friends began so happy, and ended so miserably, picking themselves off in Nick's funeral with the glory of America's national anthem, thus lifting their spirits from the dark abyss life had put them in. On a personal note, I think of this film is so much more than just an examination on the effects of War. I think it goes to examine the concept of life, and how it can just change so easily, affecting the way people continue, or chose to live it from that point. Aside from that note, it's a movie that I can call a personal favorite and truly extraordinary in both the acting and direction. It's also very oriented on trademarks, especially on the uses of its Russian religion in both the wedding scenes and even during their attributed toasts. The memorable trademark is the use of Russian roulette. I know it's very sick, and almost hard to watch, but it establishes itself as main negative factors towards several of the character's inner destruction.",

I can see why some don't like this film, because it's very real.  It's hard to deal with reality sometimes, and most would like to escape reality when watching a movie.  Well, if escaping reality when watching a movie is what you want, then I strongly advise you not to watch this film.

I feel this is drawn out unnecessarily and if anything leaves the watcher with two many assumptions and presumptions going in to the second half. However, the film takes a dark turn in the second half and pulls no punches in highlighting the terrors of war and viscousness of human beings.

Once they got to the war it showed that they were split up. They met up again through coincidence and ended up being captured. Mike helped to keep the composure of the others while they are forced to play Russian roulette. After retuning home mike goes back to get Nicky and ends up having to play him in roulette.

493,6 January 2014,MikaelaSeamans,5, The Symbolism of Russian Roulette,"Michael, Nicky, and Steven all end up being taken hostage in a Vietnamese POW camp where the people who captured them force them to play Russian Roulette. This game is where you put one bullet in a random chamber of the handgun, spin it, and you then raise it to your head, and pull the trigger. You then take turns until there's only one man left standing. I believe the point of this game is to prove ""who is man enough"", and either way--if you didn't take part in the game, you were killed anyways. The director was probably trying to prove that whoever participated in the game was ""manly"" and not perceived as ""cowardly"". I personally think Russian Roulette is the dumbest game, but for it to be shown in this particular movie, I thought it fit in very well, and I thought it was a good decision.",
494,11 December 2012,MitchTacyMusic,9, #1. The symbolism for the Russian Roulette sequences,"While this is a war movie, there are very few bullets fired, and even fewer are fired at others. Much of the film is spent playing Russian roulette, and while the American POWs weren't really forced to do this in Vietnam, it does stand as a terrific metaphor for the chances taken in wartime. During the draft, citizens were forced into the army, like the gun was forced to the characters' heads, and the longer you played the game, the less likely you were to live. You did have the option of refusing, which would get you sent to prison (symbolized here by ""the pit""), where you would eventually die anyway (spiritually, since taking that path would be giving up many privileges as an American once you got out). The last option, the one Mike and co. took, was to say no and flee before you could even put that gun to your head. To some, this may be a disgusting discrepancy to the real experiences of the war, but I find it easily forgivable; the metaphor is wholly justified, and it still gives a well-performed (if completely fabricated) account of the grim brutality of war.",
495,20 July 2001,doire,10, The heart of darkness.,"Having seen The Deer Hunter on the big screen in 1978, I watched it again today on video and was pleasantly surprised that the enormous power the movie generated in 1978 is still very much in evidence today. A dynamic anti-war film, TDH has numerous layers of meaning, allegory very much to the fore. It was an incredible performance by both De Niro and Walken, ably complemented by the other leading artists, particularly John Cazale. I do feel though that the movie was a little too long and would agree that the wedding scene was overplayed, but then again from a group of Russian-Americans at a Russian-American wedding to a trio of Russian-American soldiers being forced to participate in a fatal game of Russian Roulette perhaps requires a lengthy introduction to characterization so that the full horror of their prediction can be appreciated. Indeed, there is a lot to compare and contrast in TDH and the imagery flows thick and fast. Everybody is touched or corrupted by war and human life is cheap, both to the VC soldiers playing Russian Roulette with their prisoners and the Southern Vietnamese playing Russian Roulette with unfortunates so desperate for money that they are prepared to sacrifice their lives in the pursuit of a quick dollar. Still, I do have my criticisms of the movie. Nick does not know who Michael is when he returns to Vietnam to take him home yet he must know who Steven is since he has been sending Steven money home regularly to his ward in the Veterans hospital. How come he would know Steven but not Nick who was, after all, his best friend?. And how come a drug-riddled Nick has been so lucky at this cruel game of Russian roulette?. The luck of a man living in the heart of darkness perhaps?. In any event, this film is a masterpiece of movie-making and worthy of all the critical acclaim bestowed on it.",

498,14 February 2022,LawrenceofAsia,9, An emotional and powerful film,"Deer Hunter is a very emotional film, powerfully emotional. There are 3 acts (before war, war, and after war). The 1st act, about the life before the war, took about 1 hour. The wedding scene could be shortened to some extent. But I guess the director's intent is to build up enough foundation for the men's bond, their loves, their friendship, and their lives, for the later emotions. The film is not so much about the war (pretty short), but rather how the war changed their lives forever (the comparison before and after the war).",

500,13 April 2006,critical-escapist,9, Weekends of deer hunting turn into days of the Vietnam War.,"Shocking, fascinating, and controversial, The Deer Hunter is a great film with jaw-dropping images of war and the way of life of a few friends of Pennsylvania. The film is quite lengthy, with three significant parts. The first part shows how normal these people are  working at the local factory, attending a wedding, drinking at the local bar and enjoying weekend deer-hunting trips. Michael (Robert De Niro) is the apparent ""big brother"" of the bunch who keeps things under control. When Michael, Nick (Christopher Walken), and Steven (John Savage) get drafted to war, they are shown of war's circumstances and how it affects people's lives dramatically. When they return, nothing seems to be the same: Michael is somewhat alone, returning to Linda (Meryl Streep), Nick's girlfriend, and Steven is in a hospital, almost abandoning his wife, Angela (Rutanya Alda).",

I mean there is 'Apocalypse Now' with an extreme ""HORROR"", there is a Born on the 4th of July with it's Tom Cruise magic, Platoon, Hearts and Minds, uh...Thin Red Line...etc. Those are all brilliant, but I have a feeling particularly for this one. Half of the film is happy moments in the wedding and deer hunting session, the other half is the Russian roulette bloodbath scenes. This is an extreme heart-braking drama that blends in with a very critical action sequences. And trust me...you won't believe Chris Walken and Rob De Niro in their roles. Apocalypse Now show you the abstract visual of 'The Horror'. But this is the real deal. You now see what Brando sees in Apocalypse Now. And in this film, you will understand 'The Horror'.",

First off, keep in mind, this (Deer Hunter) is fiction. Not based on any events other than a war and a steel mill. One rater says how they just suddenly were in Viet Nam. No basic or anything. How long would you want the movie to be?! All 3 going to the same place? It's called ""The Buddy System"". You could request to stay together. The brass didn't care as long as they had warm bodies. One rater with his ""Hmmmmm..."" He needs to do some research. How do you people know what went on over there? Russian Roulette? All kinds of ""stuff"" went on. Mostly torture and starvation. No medical help (ask John McCain). You doubters need to understand: Viet Nam was not a ten year long ""Rambo"" movie. They didn't fire 600 continuous rounds from a single magazine. One guy wonders why they went from the U.S. to combat/P.O.W. camp within a minute or so. Ever watch ""Pappion""? Steve McQueen does 5 years in solitary in about 15 seconds. It's only a movie, guys! To all you Vets out there who read the drivel from the Rambo-loving non-vets, I apologize. They don't have a clue.

The answers were tough to deal with. This defiantly isn't a movie for the faint of heart. The violence is particularly painful to watch. It's done in such a way that it peers into the soul. I honestly haven't saw a more character driven film. This was a tough one get through. I expected the bad to occur and didn't want it to. When it did it was worst then expected.

Three out of five close friends joint wars and Steven lost legs, Nick had serious PTSD and only Michael came back without physical harm and serious psychological trauma. So I wonder how come Michael survived despite having horrifying experience of wars.
Firstly, Michael was the lucky one that he didn't serious injury.
Secondly, Michael was too busy with saving his friends. For Michael, Nick was the best friend among the four, they were always hunting together. I remember Michael said something like he will not go for hunting without Nick and promised Nick to bring him back.
Because of extreme experience, Nick remained in Vietnam and kept betting his life in Russian Roulette. So Michael went to Vietnam to bring Nick back despite dangerous situation there and despite romantic relationship with Linda.
In a way, Michael's life is not normal.
So I think the movie showed three victims, not two and the message is in war, no one wins.",

515,19 May 2016,hgcackowski,8, Symbolism of Russian Roulette,"Film Studies Review Concept #1: The chance of the Russian Roulette game not only symbolizes the chance in becoming drafted for the military, but the eventual outcome of the game represents the negative outcome for those who are drafted. By using the game as a symbol the director portrays the reality of Vietnam for both the characters in the film, and anyone in the US military. Continuous participation in Russian Roulette eventually results in death. In comparison, those who are drafted for Vietnam eventually end up with extreme physical, emotional, or social damage. If someone was drafted and chose not to serve, they were sent to jail or fined and criticized for not serving their country. If they agreed to fight in Vietnam they could die, become severely injured, or emotionally scarred, and if they did make it home they were scrutinized for participating in a unjust war. Regardless of the choice made, the outcome is most definitely negative. I agree with this concept and believe that the director's use of the game as a symbol for the terrifying and uncertain negative effects of war is well thought out and wonderfully effective. By comparing this situation to Russian Roulette the director shows the American view of drafting for Vietnam, especially later in the war. Not being drafted is equal to the empty chamber; you are safe from harm but must watch as others around you face a detrimental situation, and being drafted is equal to the bullet-- certain death. This view has a great effect on American patriotism, and this can be seen in the film. The scene of the wedding early in the film with American flags decorating the room and the banner reading ""serving god and country proudly,"" shows the support that the men feel for their country and their willingness to help any cause. By the end of the film this seems to have changed. After experiencing the violence of the war, being forced to play Russian Roulette in the prison (perhaps representing their forced participation in the war), returning to a country where they are unwelcome, and losing a best friend it is perceived that they don't know what to feel. In the final scene as the characters sing ""God Bless America"" at the wake they seem to still love their country in a certain way, maybe thankful for what is good about it and that they aren't living somewhere like Vietnam, but they are also sad and possibly disappointed at what a supposedly great country is doing to not only people from other countries but its very own loyal citizens. America's involvement in the Vietnam war left many devoted patriots at this time saddened and confused.",

Mike could not face himself with the guilt of going back on his promise. When he goes home without Nick he can barely face Linda, Nick's fiancé, knowing that Nick is somewhere back in Vietnam. Mike decided to go back to Vietnam to find and bring back Nick, but when Mike found him, he didn't recognize Mike and he was about to sit down at the Russian Roulette table. Mike sat down in the seat across from him, trying to stop him but when he realized it was useless to reason with him, he played Russian Roulette with him. Mike got out alive, but Nick died due to the bullet through his head. In the end Mike kept his promise, bringing Nick back to his friends and family, whether he was alive or dead.",

There is also audible speaking--the entire thing feels very Kafkaesque for this reason and one can only assume that the messages wrapped tightly within beneath the exterior have a lot more to do with LIFE than what the director of the moving film would otherwise lead you to believe.

My father was a flight line chief in Germany, and was instrumental in keeping the F 105's in top condition to bomb Viet Nam in the early 60's. My girlfriend's father was shot down and became a prisoner of war only to be released years later a broken man. I saw the evacuation of Saigon on television. I dated Viet Nam vets who one even to this day, have nightmares and flashbacks of the carnage they experienced. One who is 61 years old, was spat on when he returned from the war by a anti-war college student, and called a baby killer. I didn't watch this movie when it came out, because I heard it was an authentic portrayal of the war, and it was. It was gripping, well acted and disturbing. Just like I knew it would be. The acting was top notched. The scarred bodies and psyches of the soldiers was authentic. The effect was disturbing. I fight back the tears as I write this. I score it a 9 only because I did not watch the whole film. I think about how only recently the President finally welcomed these boys home, 37 years after the fall of Saigon. This movie is a true depiction of war. Not pretty. Not heroic. Scarring. Hurtful. A shame. And yet we still wage it. Welcome home boys.",

All the joys and sorrows are there in these characters, all their longings. Nick, who liked the way the trees looked. Beautifully acted by a young and handsome Robert Deniro, and a radiantly beautiful Meryl Streep, still in her twenties when the film was made. Chris Walken's benchmark performance that is so memorable. All of them so young, and at the top of their game as actors, immersed so completely in their roles. America in transition, and involved in a war that no one really understands. Having worn the uniform during that period of time, having been to some of those places, although not in combat, but still physically there, with life running through you like electricity, you feel a kinship with those characters, and you remember when every soldier wanted to look like DeNiro, with his beret and trench coat, and neatly pressed uniform. War is the crucible where all these emotions are melted together, a terrible war, as all wars are, that continue to claim casualties long after the last shot is fired. The music score, the casting, and the direction are all excellent. A truly worthwhile film. Here's to Nick and Mike, and all the boys who fought that war, especially those who didn't come home.

Vietnam was a war that affected everyone. young people who were drafted, were unwillingly sent into Vietnam. the families and friends of those who fought and died in Vietnam were affected. the American economy was greatly affected, and the country of Vietnam was affected as well. i think the Russian roulette sequence showed how the Vietnam war was a losing situation. if you didn't want to ""play"", you lose, if you play long enough, you lose. no matter what you do, you will lose. in conclusion this is my opinion of why the Russian roulette sequence served as a metaphor for the Vietnam war.",

The wedding sequence is incredibly boring, it is truly a film about trailer trash America, and it seems that Robert DeNiro is the only one who shows good acting along with Meryl Streep.

One of the things that makes it such an intense film is the depiction of the Russian Roulette scenes. The first time it happens, the intensity is set to 11, and along with the audience's job of feeling just how intense the war is in this scene, the audience is forced to infer something else.The prisoners and the three main characters playing Russian Roulette is supposed to be a metaphor for how the war (like the ""game"") is a lose- lose situation. No matter what happens, you'll either die (in the war or shooting yourself in the head) or you'll be scarred for life (by grazing yourself like Steven did or be emotionally scarred by the terrible things you saw and/or experienced).",

If you get the 5/6 chance of no bullet, the fact that you could have killed yourself leaves psychological trauma. The director is trying to show that no one can escape the war in Vietnam unscathed.

Anyway no war-movie has been more poignant and shocking than this one and not only thanks to the performances of Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken but above all for the magniloquent and passionate direction of Michael Cimino, who concentrate the narration on the sense of inevitability of loss and does it through unforgettable sequences (the wedding, the Russian roulette), which render the movie extraordinarily exciting.

Their lives rapidly change, however, when they're all drafted for the Vietnam War.  Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken (who won an academy award for his work in this film) are two of the main buddies in the War taking place before them.  This film won the Best Picture Oscar in 1979 and rightfully so.  One of the most memorable parts of the movie is the Russian Roulette scenes which create some of the most tension ever for a drama.  After ""The Deer Hunter"", director Michael Cimino unfortunately struck out with his bomb effort ""Heaven's Gate"" which lost tons of money and was panned by critics. 10/10",

535,14 May 2007,phoeniks-1,10, A major work,"Michael Ciminos masterful movie remains to this day a disturbing and truly compelling story about the experience of war and the importance of friendship. Without doubt a milestone in American cinema and perhaps among the ten best films of the 1970's! The cast alone is exploding: De Niro is fascinating to watch as the sensitive but ultimately strong Michael, who manages to hold the remains together, but Meryl Streep, John Gazale and particularly Christopher Walken are equally great! Perhaps to a lesser extent a movie about the anatomy of war (maybe ""Apocalypse Now"" is a greater film in that specific regard?!) and to the greatest extent a story about the necessity of being loyal to your friends despite the obstacles from an outside power. Maybe Cimino try a bit to much for pathos in the epic moments, whereas he succeeds to the fullest in the passages of describing the strong bond between the men, especially between De Niro and Savage's off course. In any event, it is a remarkable movie that does not show its age. I think the movie will remain as fresh as it is today for another 30 years! At least!",
536,31 May 2019,jackamccallum,8, Great Film with Incredible Second and Third Act but Let Down by its First,The Deer Hunter is a great piece of cinema no doubt and is superbly directed by Michael Cimino but that is not to say it is not without flaws. The first act of the film which revolves around before and after a wedding among the main characters and their friends goes for an hour with only ordinary dialogue and minimal character development there to keep people entertained. However t does provide a purpose to introduce us to the characters and make the audience care about them but it surely could have been done in at most half an hour. I am one who personally doesn't mind long movies and can sit through a lot but the first part of the film I struggled with. The second act however in Vietnam has one of the most tense scenes in cinematic history: the infamous Russian roulette scene. The tension of who could die at any second and how our hero's will escape is nail biting. Robert De Niro's performance in this film is breathtaking with the rage and loss and sadness being apparent in his face in any given scene. In the Russian roulette scene you can feel the hatred seeping out of him towards his captors and the result is truly incredible. Christopher Walken also holds his own against De Niro but subtly shows his thoughts and emotions until the third act of the film where they all come pouring out in a truly horrifying way. The third Act while not as good as the second is still gripping and brutal and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The fallout of the second act is truly haunting and seeing the results it has had to the characters you've gotten to know over the course of the film is devastating. The Deer Hunter is by no means a perfect film but is still an important part of cinema's history with incredible acting especially by Robert De Niro and a gripping and depressing tale about the effects the Vietnam war had on America.,

I particularly liked the way the director did not try to portray any of the characters as heroes,especially within a subject matter where there are no winners. I thought the title ""deerhunter"" was particularly apt when, on Michael's return from the war,he could not bring himself to kill the animal after experiencing senseless killing. I felt the backdrop of,an American industrial heartland, as opposed to a, John Wayne type Califonian beach one, gave more creditability to the movie. Some of the scenery in the deer hunting scenes was excellent. Another credit to the movie is the fact that, there cannot be many movies where so many of it's actors go on to make such long and successful careers for themselves. I am somewhat disappointed to see this movies current position in the top 250 because in my opinion there are a great many of, a lot less calibre than this in a higher position.

Second, I have watched this movie at least 10 times and learned something new each time. Yeah, there are flaws. The hunting scenes are in Washington, not Pennsylvania. Many of the Vietnamese in the movie are played by Thais. No, Russian roulette was not a part of the war. But, that is pale compared to the real horror of the Vietnam War. The movie, thanks to Michael Cimino, captures the disgusting realism of the war - from the crowded streets of Saigon, reeking of God-awful food, urine, feces, marijuana smoke and the pathetic, almost pre-historic ignorance and living conditions of the people of Vietnam to the total effect it had on our soldiers, ruining their lives and that of their families. The depiction may err in some areas, but the gut-wrenching feeling you get while watching it is real. And, having worked in and around the VA hospitals for years as a sales rep I can say authoritatively that as awful as it was in the movie, in real life it is much worse. You should see this film if you are a veteran or a member of a family of a veteran of Vietnam and understand more those whose names are on the wall and those who have somehow recovered, many with lifelong disabilities. And those of us like myself, who have suffered the effects of Agent Orange, a herbicide that the government knew was going to poison our troops and did it anyway, have pity. And for all the kids out there who love to play video games where you kill and then are killed yourself but just re-boot to get a new life - you need to see what real war is and the effect it has on everyone.",

Steve was one who seemed to go with the flow, and by simply marrying a woman knowing he was off to war was a sign of weakness. He did it to either experience marriage before he died, or to distract himself from the reality of the situation. Michael is the exact opposite, where he is quite and sets certain expectations for himself and holds true to them, such as killing the deer in one shot. If you can't do it once, don't try. He obviously has the best shot of all the men but respects what he is shooting at the same time. Nicky is right in the middle where he is a little bit immature like Steve, he is willing to learn from Michael.

While Steve a newlywed is a little more reserved, Mike the most solemn and serious of the bunch has this philosophy: ""One shot is what it's all about. You gotta kill a deer with one shot."" Which he seems to take to heart when he is forced to shoot at the Vietnamese and Vietcong alike. But near the end of the war, all have been severely damaged whether mentally or physically. Steve is in a veterans hospital in a wheel chair, Mike has PTSD, and Nick is in Vietnam forced into playing Russian Roulette until his killed. Mike goes searching for Nick only to find him a broken man, and unresponsive to Mikes plea's to come home. Mike challenges Nick to a final Roulette, Mike gets lucky and gets a blank, Nicks luck runs out and he shoots himself in front of the onlookers and Mike.

Some people complain about the first hour of this film as boring, but not me. It sets all the backstories and what the characters are like perfectly.

550,17 May 2007,sunsetridge,7, Nicole Wurm,"#1 Russian Roulette is a game of chance. Anyone who plays is at risk. Being picked from a draft is also by chance. If you are drafted it is like being sent to your grave in Vietnam. However, if you choose to be patriotic and go to Vietnam you are compared to Nick, willingly risking his life, in a game of Russian Roulette. In this game of chance it does not matter how good or bad of a fighter you are, it is all statistics. Also, to play Russian Roulette you must have a large amount of mental strength which is also a problem with Nick. It shows Nick when he is under Vietnamize capture mentally breaking down. I believe the director means to show how mentally unprepared many of the soldiers that went to Vietnam were. Also, after the war when Nick was at a point where his life was of no meaning to himself, he would play Russian Roulette almost TO Die and not being forced to, because of the mental trauma he faced in the war itself. When he does die from the game the director shows that even if the war itself does not kill you, the effects of the war will, OR you mine as well be dead. I agree with the director that the soldiers were not mentally prepared for the war, and that who died in the war was more likely by chance than anything else. I am not sure how much i agree or disagree with how much the soldiers life meant after the war, i think that depends on how mentally strong a person was before the war. I can only imagine that far too many people were unable to move on with their lives after the war. As far as patriotism i don't think the director was against it or particularly for it, but simply acknowledged that those who went for those reasons were willingly putting their lives on the line and those people should be honored(song at end of movie). #4. Shawn Collin's Comment: There were several reasons that Mike went back to Vietnam to find Nick. The first, and most important thing was the unique relationship that they shared when they were in their hometown. Their relationship was different from the relationships that they had with their other friends, even Steven. Mike only trusted Nicky. Mike didn't trust steven nearly as much as he did Nicky because he thought Steven was a wimp. When they were in Vietnam it proved Stevens weak mind even when his life was at risk in the POW camp.In the Russian Roulette scene Nicky ran off and Mike could not find him. Later, Mike went back and felt guilty for leaving Nicky after he had promised not to go back without him.",

552,17 May 2007,b_man-2003,8, # 4 from Bdog,"i feel that mike went back for nick because he felt that it was his duty and he made that promise. Before they went to war Nicky asked mike one thing, to bring him back. Mike left without Nicky and saw what the world was without him. When mike went and saw Steven and saw all the money nick was making from Russian roulette he saw that he had made a bad decision and felt it was his duty to go back and try and save Nicky before something bad had happened. He probably also felt a little guilty because now he was living with Nicky's girlfriend and that only happened because mike left without Nicky. The worst part about Mike going back for Nicky is that now he has to live with it being his fault that Nicky died because if he had never made Nicky play he never would have gotten ""hooked"" to the game.",
553,5 December 2021,jwgclifton,6, I get it - but there are too many plot holes,"I'm not going to repeat what others have said about this film, partly because I don't know anything about film-making so cannot comment on direction, cinematography etc. It's certainly a memorable film and does its job in showing the effects of war on the people involved and their families and friends. However, I found many bits so disconnected or clearly not even close to reality that I became frustrated and so wasn't as deeply immersed as I should have been. For example, in the Vets hospital Stephen shows Michael the hundreds of dollars he was being sent by Nick from Vietnam (how did Nick, now a mental wreck, incapable of even recognising his best friend, contrive to send dollar bills from Vietnam to America?) - sudden cut to Michael getting off a helicopter (alongside a highly-decorated senior officer) on the roof of the American Embassy at the same time as the Vietnamese were all queuing and fighting to get on board helicopters to get out (so it was obviously 1975 at the fall of Saigon). Now I'm all for suspending dis-belief when watching a film but just how Michael was supposed to have got himself back to Saigon in that situation and subsequently find Nick via the same seedy character we had seen from the previous Saigon scenes is completely beyond me, even allowing for a bit - or a lot - of artistic license. My feeling is that in making the wedding scene necessarily long, Cimino had to seriously condense the rest of the film just to make sure it wasn't 5 hours long, so there's no chance for him to join the dots - just show the series of dots (or scenes) with no explanation in between of how those dots ever got there. And as for how Nick survives for more than a few days playing Russian Roulette - well that's plainly ridiculous. As I said at the top, a memorable film and it makes its impact but it has too many flaws to be a classic for me.",

It leaves them scarred internally and externally, letting you feel their pain and hardships. That is what makes a great war movie, let alone a drama. The acting is right on the money, as to how a real person would feel and react toward their situation, not just some written down character in a script.

I love the minimalist approach to the first hour of the movie before they go off to war. And I am a patient viewer - I don't need a plot to keep advancing at a rapid pace, I can appreciate a great character study. But even by those standards, this movie is just too darn slow in 2010. I would have given this a 9 or 9.5 if it had been 2 hours. In fact, I'd love to see it edited down to 2 hours just see what it would feel like. Honestly, I'm writing this review before I've even seen the entire movie - I am about 20 minutes into the war segment...but I'm at a point where I just can't take the slow pace anymore. Is this an American Classic? Sure, it probably is - but when directors get gratuitous with the length of their movies because they just don't feel they can cut anything out - well, that's just hubris. Walken is great in this movie though, even with all his verbal ticks that continue throughout the rest of his career, he's better than DeNiro in this. You can see how DeNiro patterns his later roles after his earlier ones - I'm seeing a DeNiro I've seen many times later in his career here. Cazale is great. The rest are adequate.

After watching the film, it's clear that the hype comes by way of Robert De Niro's performance; believable and entirely authentic to his character. The Vietnam war itself is more of a vehicle to the centrepiece scene in the film; POW Russian Roulette and the ensuing results. Indeed, if you watch this movie, this is the once scene that makes it truly worthwhile because it was otherwise too long and not in the least gripping. If anything, the way it dragged on -particularly at the beginning- could be seen as the director's way of demonstrating that life outside of the war-zone is insignificantly mundane compared to what goes on in a shorter time span with death always moments away. Out of the 7/10 I'm rating it, six points go to Robert and one to the Roulette scene.

I totally agree with this because the Vietnam war was not the typical war, it was south vs. north, all the people looked the same we could not easily identify our enemy. These enemies were not the typical enemy, no more than Russian Roulette is the typical thing that prisoners of war play with their captures.

The way the vietminh soldiers threw the U.S. soldiers into a pit of water and left them to die, and their bodies to the rats. But these are things soon lost in the mix when you get caught up in this epic of a movie. Robert DeNiro is one of the geatest actors of all time. I know many people say once a person is in a role nobody could have played it better. But this is trully a case where noone could have played the role of Michael better than DeNiro. He brings you in from the beginning and never lets go. Just as the movie does. There are so many different emotions you are forced to feel as the piece goes along it's hard to focus on just one. But if anything jumps out at you the most it's friendship. It's never leaving someone behind. These men have a bond that others only wish they could achieve as friends. They are inseperable. But that turns out to be the problem for them. Being serperated causes a mental anguish so strong that they become trapped, a world they would never escape.

It is also a tragic story of working class men (and the women they left behind - Streep is wonderfully fragile) who went through the ordeal of the Vietnam war, with varying, but ultimately equally poignant outcomes (broken in body and spirit Savage; unreachable, suicidal Walken; seemingly strong yet bereft De Niro).

While the first third of the film is long and parts can be cut (say what you will but the marriage scene could have been slimmed down and the scene when the guys kept on driving off without John (George Dzundza) was almost unnecessary) this is an excellent film that continues to shine more than twenty-five years later. The talent in this film is immeasurable with an all-star cast including Robert DeNiro, Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken, and John Cazale. While everyone at home goes about their everyday lives, Michael (Robert DeNiro), Nick (Christopher Walken), and Steven (John Savage) go through a war that shatters their enthusiasm. The war continues to ravage their lives even after they are done fighting: Michael can no longer hunt, Nick's mind is broken as he sits playing Russian roulette in Saigon, and Steven is paralyzed. Meryl Streep deserves accolades for this film as well as she plays the woman torn between Michael and Nick. Her character demonstrates war's power in affecting those who stayed at home. Unlike so many films that romanticize wars as honorable and good vs. evil, The Deer Hunter shows that war is a hell that follows you home. The last scene in Saigon will catch you by surprise every time you watch it.",

583,24 January 2013,snix_rocks,8, Long but good movie!,One of the first things I liked about this movie is how they set up the whole beginning of the movie. They set it up to let everyone get a feel where everyone was from and what relationship they had with each other which I think was cool. When they went over to fight in the war I think they didn't do enough of setting that up. They just kinda started after they had been there for awhile. I think that some of the stuff that happened when they were captured was pretty crazy and I wonder if stuff like that really happened. Its pretty crazy what they had to go through. So I don't blame them if they were really effected by all that. I think there could have been different endings that could have been better but that is just me. I thought it was also interesting that when they went hunting again he couldn't deal with anymore death so he didn't shoot his buck he was tracking.,

While in Vietnam, they are captured by the Vietcong and submitted to a game of Russian roulette, which consists of you having to point a gun to your own head and pull trigger hoping that the bullet won't go through your head. The three friends are able to escape one of these ""games"" thanks to Michael's cunning. However, shortly thereafter, Michael, Nick, and Steve go their separate ways.

The script is perfectly written, but dialogue is surprisingly scarce, focusing more on breathtaking vista shots. My favourite scenes are the ones where DeNero and his fellow Steelworkers, go Deer Hunting. The landscape is very appealing and the music and atmosphere are just absorbing. The famous Russian Roulette is very tense, and features some great acting, even though the way they escape is quite frankly, ludicrous. Finally this film has one of the most memorable last acts in movie history, finishing off with a song, quite fittingly, with a song about America. This song sums up the entire films plot, it is a film about America.I highly recommend you watch this film. For the performances, camera work and the complex characters.",

I saw this at the theater as a kid expecting it to be more of a war flick than it turned out to be (meaning more battlefield action) but having seen it over and over again as an adult, it has grown to be one of my favorite flicks of all time - occasionally topping ""my list"" as number 1.

It is hard to say this is the best war movie, because I find it to be more of a character study and the war involvement is coincidental. I enjoyed getting to know the characters in the beginning of the film, and I also enjoyed the aspect of getting a closer look at not the war, but the mental feel of the war. If I may be so frank to say, I literally crapped my pants in the final Russian roulette scene. I can personally relate to this movie, and I'm sure everyone else can at a time or two throughout their lives. There are so many ways for you to become someone you don't understand. There are so many different aspects of ourselves that we don't even know are there. But there comes a piece of art such as TDH that comes along and touches you personally. This film has taught me that there doesn't have to be a point made across to entertain or enthrall or even relate to you, but simply show yourself. And this is what the characters in this film did, they showed themselves and opened up such dark and mysterious parts of their personalities that becomes all too human. Films like these show us how dysfunctional our society is, and what a complicated world it is we live in. The film itself is slow moving, but there is no ""big point/climax"" in my eyes that you have to get to. The point of this film is for us to understand that not everyone is a perfect product of society, and it gradually teaches us at a rate we can fully learn. As for the performances, this film has given me great thought into thinking of Walken as one of the greats of our time. He is uncontrollably amazing, even if it seemed too simple. De Niro gave one of the performances of his life, which isn't his norm to do a roll like this, but he was perfect for it. Streep and Cazale are fine supporters, just not at Walken's level at that time. All in all, this film deserves every award out there, and for it to show us such a problem of our own, it rightfully has won. See this movie, see it again, and give thought to it. It is amazing.",

It is void of all these facets. Instead, it explores only the ugly facts, aftermaths and most importantly the running theme : the mortality of man (""one bullet is enough"" for the deer and the Russian roulette) that can not be compromised by our generic protagonists performing heroic acts in slow-mo. Whether the Russian Roulette scenes are accurate portrayals or not can be argued; if the credibility of the these scenes bother the realists amongst us then that is certainly a point that needs to be respected. On the other hand, if we are to perceive this game as an allegory (as I think was intended, judging by the lack of any actual war scenes of substance), we have an all-encapsulating notion of war as a game of chance that our characters are subjected to and the traumatic affects it has on their perception of life (Nicky needing to repeat this action).

For me this is neither a tale of Vietnam action , and the extreme effect it has on the innocent like Apocalypse Now; and neither a tale of the homegrown American who leaves behind their romantic but humdrum mid-western existence only to be thrown into the worst of people's nightmares like Platoon. The Deer Hunter stays too long on the home life of the main characters, and for me fails to explain their true relationship, because not all of them go to war! The beginning of the film really drags on once you realise that the wedding scene is played out in full detail. It felt like I'd spent a whole day at the wedding. Yes we'd discovered some new revelations about the characters, but for a film that was 3 hours long, the beginning could have been more succinct. It is the fact that the script labours too long on the home life and not enough time on the war, and the aftermath that leaves me thinking that this ""classic"" piece of cinematography doesn't really cut it in the 21st century. If you take Gone with the Wind (some 68 years old), the script is so strong that you can relate to the individuals, feel the tension throughout the whole drama and come away feeling emotive. But with The Deer Hunter, (sarcastically) it was neither an intense Deer hunting film or a good Vietnam Movie. It just did both interpersonal relationship and Vietnam war OK, but neither exemplary.

It seems as if every war movie that is released is competing in a game of trying to one up the last by showing a more fantastic way to kill someone. I find this quite sad; not because of the use of images to capture an audience, but because I feel we lose a real understanding of why wars are fought.  In the midst of all of these supposed great war movies critics throw at us every year, there are very few that have reached and tried to explain what war really is and how it affects humanity.  Not only do I believe that The Deer Hunter is the greatest war movie ever to do this, but I also think it has one of the most affecting scenes for the audience to watch in movie history.  This movie uses a symbolic device to drive the movie in an emotional way that never tries to preach, and instead gives the audience a glimpse of what war can do to humanity an many levels.  War movies are special because they can quantify so much about life and death that other types of movies cannot, but this also places higher expectations for the genre itself.  The Deer Hunter provides some of the finest acting that any movie will ever be able to offer, and will be sure to transform you in some way.",

His direction is flawless, down to the minute facial expressions and body movements of even the least important of the secondary characters. The atmosphere of total despair, when the value of human life is brought down to no value at all, is suffocating. Perhaps only stories of survivors from the Nazi Death Camps carry a similar aura. And in the relatively short duration of this inferno-on-film, Cimino takes us through the unfolding stories of his three heroes: Stevie/Savage cracking down under the immense and inhuman pressure, Nick/Walken beginning the process of being gripped by the black dog of madness, and then there is Michael/DeNiro. The viewer - no matter if male, female, straight or not - cannot help but fall in love with this on-screen person, this tower of strength and humanity. If you are ever to be in real dire straights, if you are ever to walk in the valley of the shadows - you pray to your creator to send a Michael/DeNiro to stand by you. I have rated this movie a 9 because it is not a perfect movie, however the Roulette scene reaches beyond perfection, and into the realm of true greatness. Cimino in directing and DeNiro in acting have here reached the very top of the mountain.",

633,23 December 2021,arsenmaxhuni,9, One of a kind,"I would say: A beautiful film, not a movie but a film. A piece of art not suitable for someone looking for action and fast paced cinema, but for someone who can appreciate the filmography of a beautiful story on how lives are changed. The happiness and foolishness that leads the young men to war, just for them to understand what torture war is. Only one coming in one piece. Loved to struggle that Mike had adapting to a normal life, the scars left to Steve and the horrible fate of Nick. Left me speechless when I understood his suffering and fate, that was not riches but rather losing his mind to heroine.",

Christopher Walken plays the role of a lifetime, and De Niro & Streep are perfect for their roles as well. This is the only movie in which after viewing it, I was so shocked/disturbed/depressed that I didn't want to move, all I could do was think about the movie for an hour afterward. The only movie that even comes close to affecting you as much as this film is Requiem for a Dream. If you haven't seen The Deer Hunter, do yourself a favor and go see it. It's guaranteed to be one of, if not the most memorable film you will ever see.",

636,12 November 2016,hudsonclarksmith,10, A Superb Piece of Filmmaking,"""The Deer Hunter"" is a superb film with great emotional prowess and courage. It is a story of three friends in a rural town and their lives, from wedding to funeral, and the impact the Vietnam war had on them.",
637,9 March 1999,wilko-2,10, An immensely powerful film,"I have rarely been so moved by a film. It stays in the mind for a hell of a long time. Perfectly captures the futility, horror and comradeship of war.",
638,5 October 1999,jacek-4,10, that movie gave me that extra angle on happenings of the Vietnam era in this country,"Wow, I mean what an experience that was! Ask yourself a question: when was the last time you were so touched by a movie, that by the end of it tears started to roll down your cheek? Well, that one did it for me! Like so many people before me I got to say, this story will move you inside.",
639,20 March 2000,snake-48,8, Pretty good and quite original,"That's what I call an original movie! The director chose to split the movie into 3 separate sections (before/during/after the war) and the result is very interresting to watch. Actually the 'during' part may disappoint some people, because it almost does not contain any fighting scenes (if you're one of those ""action-movie"" fanatics, go watch Saving Private Ryan instead). The movie's originality comes from the fact that it's not focusing on the war itself, but rather on the effect it has on some ordinary people.",
640,28 July 2001,crumpler,8," Good, very good, very long, but good.","The Deer Hunter lopes along like so many films from the 70s, and at first, at least for me, I felt like this one was cut long simply so that it would fit the trend of 70s film lengths.  However, if you can sit through the entire wedding reception scene and others like it, you'll start to see that Michael Cimino did in fact have a purpose.  I think it can be best understood when you take into account how short most of the Viet Nam scenes are by comparison.",
641,16 May 2001,Puddums,10, Fantastic and heart-wrenching,"This film was wonderful. I first read about it in Empire and remember recording it ages ago but never getting around to watch it. I decided to rent it one day and a few hours later couldn't stop crying. The acting was superb, the script gripping and the way the two halves of those people's lives were shown was brilliant.",

643,20 April 2006,iffyash,9, long and good,"The Deer Hunter leaks out a sweet languor for periods at a time. It takes its time while also moving determinedly. It is like a marathonwe settle into a certain pace, we keep that pace for a long stretch, and then we speed it up if only for a change, in order to inoculate the impending threat of boredom. We enter into another world, as if going on a mission ourselves. In taking this lead towards a war analogy, I will go as far as to say that going off to Vietnam for a good long stay is analogous to watching this movie, while going to you name it for vacation is analogous to watching most other movies. I mean this in a way that does not compare the real life Vietnam to a movie; it was of course much more, well, real than that. I mean that one comes of this movie feeling like he/she has lived in another world, been on a long and meaningful journey there and returned home with some stories to tell about it, and some to keep to himself...",
644,5 May 2001,ExorcistFreak,10, One of the best!,"""The Deer Hunter"" is one of the best American films ever, and perhaps the best war film of all time.  It is an engrossing film that takes you into the depths of the tragedies of war (eg what happens to DeNiro and Walken when they are taken as POWs) and their effects and consequences.  It has me from beginning to end, and my heart races non-stop during the sequences where they are playing Russian roulette.",
645,27 May 2001,hankwilliamssr1999,10, True Epic,"The Deer Hunter is without a doubt one of the greatest films in American history. The Vietnam War is such a dark period in American culture, one that is seldom mentioned in society today. This film does not attempt to show lots of intense war scenes that are typical in war films. This movie is so much more than a war film. It shows the results of a war gone wrong on families. And how the war not only changes the people that fight in it, but those back at home as well. Robert De Niro plays another excellent role in this film. Why he did not win an Academy Award for Best Actor is beyond me. No one can play the role of a quiet leader the way that De Niro does. Although Godfather Part II possibly will be remembered as his finest moment, to me he accomplishes more in this film because he shows his diversity as an actor. Christopher Walken is also excellent. One of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. He pulls off a very complicated role and should be remembered as one of the best supporting actor roles ever with his part as Nick in this epic. The Deer Hunter is certainly one of the Top 10 movies of all-time. It is not necessarily a film that children would like or anyone wanting to see a good action film, that is not what The Deer Hunter is about. This is a movie about the effects of war. A very sad and disturbing film, but if you haven't seen it you are missing out. 98-100 easily!",

People who do like it are most often people who 'knows good film when they see it' and people who don't are likely 'people who enjoys a good mainstream Arnold action film friday night'. I know, this might be an elite kind of bulls**t, but this film is in my narrow view a really a good divider.",
648,25 July 2001,Miryam,10, A quite unique experience,"The Deer Hunter is a masterpiece. Not only because a great cast like Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken do such a great, highly believable acting job (which also is due to Michael Cimino's excellent directing) but also because the story about those people touches you so directly. Simple small town people with friends and family and rituals and traditions like we could have them, too. Like when we get to participate at length a wedding party, get to know the five men and their women, the focus becoming stronger on the two unlike brothers, Michael and Nick Vronsky (played by De Niro and Walken), who do share their affection for the same woman, Linda, played with great feeling and freshness by Meryl Streep. The five men enjoy their ritual of occasional deer hunting, presented in a touching scene when they quarrel over a banality, but it shows who is seriuos about himself and who isn't. And when the Vietnam War begins, it's only Michael and his brother Nick, and their friend Steve (gripping performance by John Savage), who go to fight for their country. This is when it get's uncomfortable. The psychological pressure, the damage to their souls and their all over health the audience is going to witness is undescribable. It's not a horror movie, but a psycho-thriller for sure.",
649,29 July 2001,jpgsaysoan,10, The end of the age of innocense.,"Of all the movies I've seen, including ""Platoon,"" this movie is about the Vietnam War, the end of the age of innocence, the growing up of America. Ironically, the Vietnam battle scenes, capture, and escape only take up a few of the 184 minutes of running time of the entire movie.  But more than any other movie, it reflects the end of the glorification of war for our country.  Wars sometimes have to be fought, but this piece of art work ended the myth that war is noble and about glory. Having been there at the end, I am grateful for this work as it finally says all that needs to be said about our involvement in Vietnam and any other war in which we are asked to fight. In a recent very popular TV show, one character comments to another about the reasons for our ever extending exploration of space and the universe. (Paraphrased) ""We came out of the woods, crossed the hills, saw the mountains and crossed them to go on and jump to the moon and planets, and eventually to the stars.""  It's a noble sentiment, our becoming more and more civilized and our thirst for exploration, etc., but this movie reminds me that maybe we haven't really come out of the woods yet.  -The pentimento of man.",
650,15 December 2006,dwlarsen,10, Truly Inspired Wedding Scene(s),"There are many things to praise about The Deer Hunter. I will always treasure the lengthy wedding scenes, Cimino's ability to inspire and capture authentic drunken and emotional behavior of many characters. The ethnic charms and foibles of the community are very crisply drawn. If there were just 20 minutes of film to watch, this would be it for me. If you had ever been to such a wedding at such a time in our history, this film sends you back there with the fondest memories.",
651,24 April 2023,PvT_JKR,10, The best war movie of all time,"I have to admit that this movie is a bit boring and to long for me for the first 40 mins to an hour. But I think that everyone understands that the ""boring"" part is very important for the story. You get to know the friendgroup very well and especially the friendship between Mike and Nick. My favorite part of the movie is the iconic Russian roulette scene when mike fools the vietnamese. But I think the whole Vietnam war section is a masterpiece. This movie is a cinematic masterpiece. I think that The deer hunter cast is one of the best if not the best cast of all time. The end is very iconic and one of the best end scenes of all time. The last thing is that the game ""russian roulette"" that they play through out the movie was NOT a real thing during the Vietnam war.",

Who could ask for a better cast?  This film is defintely on of my favorites. Brilliant direction by Michael Cimino.  Brilliant acting by Robert De Niro, John Cazale, Meryl Streep, and Christopher Walken along with John Savage. Just a good, all around, moving film.",
656,10 November 2002,Hayden-10,10, Still AMAZING,"Saw the anniversary wide screen edition on AMC recently. Still arguably the most important film of the seventies.  Performances are outstanding.  I was stunned watching Christopher Walken, the great and seemingly forgotten John Savage, and of course Robert DeNiro out in the jungle.  It is hard to believe what happened to Cimino's career.  Much like Orson Wells ""Citizen Kane"".",

658,3 May 2003,joyfullfunk,10, A brilliant and powerful film,"One of the most brilliant and powerful movies I have ever seen. Astonishing performances by Robert De Niro, Chrisotpher Walken, Merryl Streep, and John Savage. De Niro steals the show. He creates a character that is totally believable, seemless and humane. One of the great flawed protagonists of all time. He's not the epic hero that many moviegoers demand. He's human, he's in love with his best friend's girl, he doesn't know how to save his friends, yet everyone looks to him as the leader of the group. This is my favorite and, in my opinion, the best of De Niro's incredible career. This movie is at times a celebration of life, a powerful anti war movie, a story of tragic loss and true friendship. The scenes with the Russian roulette are some of the most intense scenes I have ever watched. De Niro takes acting to new heights in these scenes. And the ending of the movie, with everyone singing God Bless America is touching and the perfect way to conclude. The movie will stay with you long after you have viewed it. Great direction by Michael Cimone. 10 out of 10 without a doubt. One of the greatest not only war movies but overall dramas of all time.",
659,10 March 2003,rocker79,10, wedding is actually the best part,"I think that the whole movie is outstanding also the wedding part of the movie.It shows party life of three good friends before they go to vietnam;you can see there that they don't even know where will they go;i like when they meet the vietnam veteran who came to the wedding also;you can easy see the resemblance with him and Michael (when he come back). The best scene from wedding is definately when Angela lose a drop of wine,where you can already expect problems in Vietnam. Michael have much thoughts about Linda at the wedding but i don't mean just when they go to a drink but only their looks in the dancing crowd. When Nick ask to marry Linda he asks:""if....when we'll come back"";i like this sentence because he corrects himself, and there you feel that maybe he found out just for a moment that maybe he would be better to stay home in clairton.I just think that all this couldn't be shown in 15 or 20 minutes.",
660,9 March 2003,rocker79,10, just the best,"This sure is supreme movie;movie gives you a main detail about vietnam, not like the other vietnam movies;except Platoon! I like it all from the first minute to the last ,lot of people says that marriage scene is too long...that is not true!!You can see how mindless were three friends before going to nam, you can see their happiness because they didn't know where will they go! Specialy wedding is important because movie have a lot of moments which you wouldn't undestand if wedding would be shorter;when Angela lose a drop of wine....because if she wouldn't everything maybe wouldn't be so black in the future;and you can see that Michael like Linda(Merly Streep) for the first time....and don't like other girls ..all this is shown on the wedding! I like scene when Stan wan't to borrow Michael shoes and his last answer is:""hey stan....i said no!""..here you can see that Michael really has his own sense of ""surviving""!! Everything Michael do have meaning!!I like it also Christopher Walken as Nick;i like him at the wedding when he approach linda and says:""if...when we'll come back"", i like when he correct him self first if then when...i think that in this moment he fell (just a little) that maybe would be better to stay home in clairton. And scene about russian roulette is just beautiful ,where also John Savage as Steven shows what he do in this movie. When Michael come back from nam you can see resemblance with the gren bare man at the bar. When Michael come back to the Nam to look out for Nick....you can remember the promise which Michael gave to the nick just after the wedding. So i can easily say that a like all actors from this movie specialy de niro(i relly think that he DEFENETLY deserve Oscar for this movie too,Walken,Meryl Streep and John Savage)",

662,4 September 2003,Lance_Heidern,10, A knockout war film,"Instead of desribing the body count, blood, guns and smokes, the Dear Hunter focus much more on the human nature itself.

I will admit however that I found the first hour to be overlong and uninteresting, therefore causing me to knock my grade down one notch. The film picks up and becomes interesting as it moves on though. The Russian Roulette scenes in the film are some of the most intense moments in film history. Keep that in mind.",
664,6 August 2004,jbc_dkdk,10, One of the Best!!!,"The Deer Hunter is absolutely one of the best movie I have ever seen. The actors are great, especially Robert de Niro, and the music is fantastic. The movie is about three friends, Mike(Robert de Niro), Nick(Christopher Walken, and Stewen(John Savage), they live in a little town somewhere in Pensylvenia. The have to go to ""Nam"", to participate in the War, So they leave their much beloved home.The war changes their lives differently, Steven looses both his legs, Mike gets depressed, and Nick disappears in Saigon. It's truly a classic, and one of the best movies of all time. Michael Cimino is the most underestimated director in the world. The Deer Hunter is Great!!!!!!!!",
665,25 June 2005,Whitesox400,10, Moved me to tears for the first time,"This is the finest war film ever made. Rather, it is one of the finest dramas ever made that happens to involve war. Movies nowadays are more artistic than human. This was not so in the late seventies when people wanted to be brought closer to understanding people rather than be taken away on an adventure to what they never thought possible (of course 'Star Wars' changed that but that's for another story). 'The Deer Hunter' is one of the last of its kind along with 'The Godfather' where the audience is absorbed as one of the characters and winds up consoling in the end, moved by either tragedy, optimism, helplessness, love, desperation, or remorse, but I felt all of them in 'The Deer Hunter'.",
666,1 July 2006,shoresus2001,10, Gets better as time goes by,"I have been watching The Deer Hunter ever since it was released in 1978 about 8 to 10 times. Along the years one can see why Robert De Niro deserves to be considered one of the best American actors. The rest of the cast is impeccable. Close to the end, in the scene when George Zdunza is in the kitchen beating the eggs and he stands there crying alone, really makes my cry. He then joins the rest of the group, encourages them with his humming of God Bless America, and then he is followed by this admirable group of friends. If you have to look for a theme for this film, even though the main subject is war, I think that it is also about true friendship. Is there any other kind?",
667,18 February 2005,black_n_t,10, my personal favorite movie of all times...,i honestly can't remember how many times i have seen this film...,
668,10 June 2005,realjohnn,6, Unforgettable scenes,"I think that the Deer Hunter is exceptionally tense at times especially in the infamous Russian Roulette scenes. These scenes are unforgettable and you are on the edge of your seat for most of them. The rest of the film attempts to capture a slice of life about what it was like about living in this part of Amercia at this moment in time(during the 1960's with the Vietnam war the main issue of the times). It does this very successfully but it does so in a boring and mundane way. This film is over three hours long and I think that they could have sliced a hour off it or certainly a good bit of an hour. The filmmakers are to focused on ramming down our throat what it was like for these characters living in small town Amercia. We get what's it like. We don't need as much of it. This I think is an average film but the Russian Roulettes scenes are unforgettable. For them alone this film is worth watching. The rest though of what is on offer doesn't add up to, to much.",
669,16 May 2005,oztrailyan_guy,9, Excellent War Time Movie,"This movie is defiantly one of the best war time depictions that I have ever seen. I found the acting excellent. Christopher Walken's performance was superb and really brought the viewer to feel his melancholy emotions brought on by Russian roulette torture. Robert Di Niro so too played his part brilliantly showing the rapid pace of change in his characters life brought about by the Vietnam War. I found that the movie itself had an excellent build up and really provided an insight to the emotional strain that the Vietnam War had on such towns as the one featured in the film. Though the movie sometimes felt as ""slow"" at times it was not so, the movie provided an in-depth background into the comradeship of the friends. This camaraderie was shown greatest when escaping from the Vietcong and returning to Saigon at the end of the film. The cinematography was outstanding, the movie portrayed years of friendship and misfortune in just 180minutes. I particularly enjoyed the fact that original Vietnam War film footage was inserted into the movie. This brought you back to fact that this actually did happen so too that peoples lives were ruined and others left to clean up the pieces of it. The ending would also have to be one of, if not the best endings of any movie that I have viewed. All central characters are brought together and sing an American Ballad, this I believe symbolized the fact that unity was achieved through the end of a life and/or the war. Although an Australian citizen myself this movie appeals to all who had ties to the war and gives and accurate and descriptive depiction of what was the Vietnam war. I would strongly recommend this film and give it 9 and 1/2 stars.",
670,7 December 2012,mnugent210,9, #2,"The three varying personalities of the main characters, Nick, Steve, and Mike, are demonstrated in the wedding arc of the film. This character study is important to subtly establish traits of the three main characters that later demonstrate why they all fared the way they did in Vietnam. Steve's kind and accepting personality is demonstrated by his marrying Angela, a woman that is pregnant with another man's child. He also shown to still be under some kind of influence of his mother. This would explain why he doesn't fare well in combat and why he regresses to a child like state, hoping that Mike will protect him. Nick is shown to be a risk taker in the wedding arc. This obviously explains why he becomes so invested in playing Russian Roulette. Mike is shown to be the leader of his group of friends. They come to him for help and he generally has the last say on issues. Mike refuses to act on his feelings for Nick's girlfriend due to his dedication to their friendship. These traits display themselves in Vietnam when Mike assumes his role as leader of the three and protects both Nick and Steve. He demonstrates his dedication to his and Nick's friendship by going back to Vietnam to try and bring Nick back home.",
671,10 September 2005,elscaro,9," Legacy Series Deer H., DVD Surround sound is 5.1","With much confusion and contradiction about the picture and sound quality; I thought I would share my findings. Although the package and software graphics did offer a 2.0 and a ""surround"" prefaced by a logo from Harmon International; selecting the (Harmon surround logo) surround on the DVD menu will provide full activation of a 5.1 system! (including the bass speaker, front and rear speakers. In other words the sound is a full 5.1 holosonic environment. This is based on my ears and indicators on my system, showing this full activation.

672,9 December 2012,JustShaniEm,10, #4. Why does Mike go back to Vietnam to find Nick? Be specific with this one and use examples,There are many reasons as to why Mike went back to Vietnam for Nick. The first and most obvious reason is that Mike and Nick are friends. The next reason is that Nick asked him not to leave him in the scene after the wedding. Mike and Nick were at a basketball court and after a bit of drunken conversation Nick gets serious and pleads to Mike that no matter what happens to please not leave him. The final reason is that Mike feels bad. He feels bad that he left Nick there. He feels bad about the fact that he has had a thing with Nick's girl. He feels selfish for knowing what is probably going on with Nick and not telling anyone. He also knows that Linda wants Nick back and because he loves her which means he wants to make her happy he will go back to get him.,

674,14 December 2005,mmmmgrrreat,8, Why did mikey go back for nicky?,"In the beginning of the movie Nicky made Mikey promise that he wouldn't leave him in Vietnam. Unfortunately, it was very hard for Nicky to keep that promise considering the circumstances. In a scene where Michael is playing Russian Roulette, Nicky enters the room. The viewer is ultimately confused as to whether or not they see each other. until Mikey chases after Nicky.Later Mikey goes back to find Nicky because he ultimately feels guilty for and goes back to get him. Mikey has an obligation to at least keep his one promise. He already abandoned the ""one shot"" rule and only had one promise left to keep.Unfotunately, nicky looses to a game of Russian Roulette.",
675,15 July 1999,frog-7,10, The true meaning of the film!!,"The Deer Hunter is one of the most brilliant films ever made but it is about much more than the horrors of war and how Vietnam screwed up a group of friends. The war is about the death of the spirit of all individuals. In the film the characters lose thier belief in America. Going into the Vietnam war most Americans believed that their country was a beacon of justice and was an international do gooder. The Vietnam War destroyed that myth for millions of Americans, both civilians and soldiers. The war exposed the U.S. as the imperial-capitalist exploiter that it is. The loss of faith by the community is most beautifully shown as every sings God Bless America after Nicks funeral. They are all deadened and flat -- what a lie the song is! Even more beautifully displayed however is the personal loss, by Nick played by Christopher Walken. Going into Vietnam Nick and Mike (Robert DeNiro)both believe in America, but more symbolically they both believe in the perfection of shooting a deer with one shot in the mountains close to god when all is perfect in the world. But after Vietnam the belief is gone, Mike can not shoot a deer in one shot. And Nick is unable to live after Mike reminds him of one shot. Its the lie Nick was trying to avoid in Russian Rollette parlors all over Saigon but then its there in front of him, How can he live, he must die!! One Shot was a sham! - America is lie!

There are a few reasons for why he does this. One reason is that Mike made a promise to Nick during that one scene where Mike runs down the street naked after Stevie's wedding. He promised Nick that he wouldn't leave him behind in Vietnam. Mike felt obligated as a friend to venture back into Vietnam and find out what happened to him and bring him home. Another reason he wanted to bring Nick home was because he wanted to make Linda happy. Even though Mike was in love with Linda, it was against his moral code to just leave Nick in Vietnam so he could be with her. It was apparent to Mike that Linda still had strong feelings for Nick, as shown in that scene where Mike stops at the grocery store and sees Linda crying in the storage room. I think Mike cared more for the well-being of Linda and Nick than his hopes for a relationship, and I think Mike knew Linda could never be happy unless he brought Nick home to her.",

The three young men eventually go off to Vietnam and end up in a POW camp where they are subjected to the torturous will of their captors.

The scenes of torture, physical and mental, is gruesome, and one of the most stirring scenes ever captured on film. The scene is revisited throughout the film and each incident is even more harrowing than the original. Christopher Walken deserved and earned his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and the film was truly the Best Picture of 1978, though one award it missed was Best Actor for De Niro. See this movie at all costs. Several movies that impact one so much that come to mind are: American History X, Apocalypse Now (my vote for best war movie), Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful, and Shine.

Without that the rest of the film would be below average.  The fact that you (should) care about the characters is what makes the film give you a horrible feeling inside.  This movie performed the rare action of evoking emotion in me.  I hardly ever care about the characters in a movie, because hey, it's just  a movie.

Everything in the Vietnam War had a degree of randomness to it; even the draft system relied for awhile on birthdays drawn like a lottery. The idea that the men had no choice but to play the Russian Roulette symbolized how they had to fight even if they didn't agree with it.

Well, Mike and Nickey meet up at a small village and get captured and they have to play Russian roulette against each other and they both survive but then they get split up again. Mike sees Nickey at a Russian roulette club where people bet on people playing and Nickey doesn't see Mike and a french guy takes Nickey away and basically brain washes him. So, Mike goes back home and he almost starts to fall for Nickeys girl, and when he goes hunting, he can't shoot a deer because that is what him and Nickey used to do, and when he goes to visit Steve, Steve shows him a drawer full of money and Mike knows that money is from Nickey so Mike feels like he has to go back to fulfill that promise. But when he gets back, Nickey is basically brainwashed or too far gone from drugs that he doesn't remember Mike, so Mike plays Russian roulette against Nickey and right before Nickey shoots himself, he remembers the phrase ""one shot"" because that is what Mike always said how to hunt deer, is with ""one shot"".",

Steve is the weakest and is the first friend to be seriously injured when he falls from the helicopter.

Howver, Mike doesn't really seem to have a choice. His ability to assimilate back into normal society seems to be dependent on his bringing Nick home- dead or alive. This is most evident when Mike first returns without Nick and attempts to go hunting. Though one could argue he doesn't slay the animal due to a new respect for life after seeing so much death, one could just as easily attribute this lack of will to kill the deer as being Mike's inability to continue his life knowing Nick should be back home with him.",
717,14 May 2007,mary-devlin,7, #1,"I believe that the director wanted you to understand that playing Russian Roulette is a lose- lose situation in the end. This directly correlates to the 18 or 19+ year old that were forced to go into the war because of the draft. Many of the men who served in Vietnam had fathers who were WWII veterans, so they were looked down upon if they coward their way out of the draft. In turn though, if they were drafted and went to war, it was a death sentence. In the movie, Russian Roulette was played to see who had enough ""guts"" to kill themselves by chance. It was a risk with a great reward, but the risk was death. The draft worked in the same way. You could go to war and be killed or have psychological/physical damage, or stay home and be looked down upon from your family. America is built upon our patriotism for our country and if one is a coward because he finds a way to not be drafted then he is immediately disowned in a sense. America doesn't want our men and troops to die, but we rather have them fight for our freedom then sit back and watch other men die.",
718,15 May 2007,brittersweet16,6, day 2/block 1,"#1. I think that the symbolism of the Russian Roulette scenes did not accurately portray the Vietnam War. It was supposed to symbolize that regardless how lucky or fortunate you may be throughout the war, eventually your luck would come to an end, and basically just wind up killing you. Similar to Russian Roulette, if you were to go into the Vietnam War it was technically a lose-lose situation. You may win some money and not get shot but you're never going to be completely safe. If you were a Vietnam soldier, you would either end up dead, or severely mentally or physically ill for the rest of your life. Nikki, for example was mentally and physically stable prior to playing Russian Roulette. However, after playing more games and not shooting himself, he became emotionally 'sick.' He didn't even recognize his life-long friend or want to return home. Russian Roulette, much like the war, had taken over his body and soul and he was never going to be the normal, sane individual that he once was.",
719,15 May 2007,vmcmanus2001,8, The Deer Hunter Questions,"1) The director used the Roulete sequences as a metaphor. When Mike, Nicky, and Steve played the director showed how each were unraveling due to the war. I agreed with the director's use of the roulette scenes, because they showed how each of the three men reacted to the intensity of the game, and inadvertently the war. 2) Steve is by far the most unstable, which we see even when the men are at home. When he tells Mike that he hasn't slept with his fiancé' you know something is off about him. Nicky is also somewhat unstable, due to the fact that he is always willing to bet. Mike is the most stable, which is his strongest characteristic. He has a concrete way of doing things, and cannot complete a task unless it is done step by step. And, because of Mike's strong and stable will he gets through the war affected, but not to the degree of Nicky or Steve. 3) The French character is suppose to represent the image American's had on the war in Vietnam. The French where thought to have lured America into Vietnam and then left when we needed them. 4) Mike goes back to Vietnam, because he told Nicky before they left that he wouldn't leave him.

The French economic interests in Vietnam cared little for civil liberties just as he cared little for the welfare of the players he recruited. Their eyes were only on the profit; no matter what the cost was to others. In America's attempt to keep a safeguard against communism, by preventing the domino effect in protecting the French allies, they paid the bulk of the price with the sacrifice of American soldier's lives. Nicky's (the American soldier) good-hearted attempt to protect and provide for the future of the one's he loved back home, proved trivial in his downfall as it took away what home wanted most which was to have Nicky back. Thousand s of young draftees came back from the war changed or not at all. In the end Nicky's effort shown through money wasn't even useful to injured Steve, just as the American soldiers' death did not gain any progress in Vietnam. More Americans died in the war than the French, just as the middleman simply exchanged the cash and was never really in any danger himself as he did nothing of consequence or influence. The French caused a draft of American soldiers like the Russian Roulette French man drafted players to their unnecessary deaths; all for the game of global economics. Had the French given up what was not theirs, being hypocrites in a ""post-imperialist"" World War II world, the Americans would not have had to die helping their friends to stay alive financially, which is like if the French man had not kept Nicky in the game (even though it was obvious to anyone with soul that Nicky needed out if he was going to survive), Nicky would not have shot himself in the fruitless attempts of trying to financially assist his friends in Clairton.

Mike went back to Vietnam because he found that Nicky had been playing Russian Roulette and sending his winnings to America. Mike wanted Nicky to come home because they were best friends, and he didn't know anything about his whereabouts, or even if he was alive. He went to save Nicky, but his attempts proved futile, as Nicky shot himself in the head anyway. He went to get answers, and hopefully to bring his best friend home. So much for that. After all of the trouble and horrible things they had seen in Nam, Nicky started showing signs of Shell Shock (or Post Traumatic Stress Disordr), and then he stopped acting like his old self.

The Deer Hunter really summed up Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and the effect it can have even on those who aren't suffering from it. The movie did a good job of making the character's story realistic. I had never seen Robert Dinero in any of his earlier films and really enjoyed seeing some of his early work.

I really liked how Mike went back for Nick, I thought that was probably the best part of the movie, because it showed how much their friendship meant to him, I'm sure other people would have just left him there. I also feel like he went back to make Nick realize that if he stayed there longer, he would honestly go insane. One thing that kind of didn't work for me during the film was when Mike and the other guy fell off the helicopter, i thought that was pretty random, but it still fit with the story line.

734,18 December 2007,achase448,6, 4. Why does Mike go back to Vietnam to find Nike? Be specific with this one and use examples.,"I think Mike goes back to get Nicky in Vietnam for a couple of reasons. The first being that Nicky told him one night before they left that he didn't want to be left in Vietnam alone, and he wishes that Mike would come and get him if that problem ever comes up. Also, I believe that Mike seeing Nicky's girlfriend so messed up from the possiblilty that Nicky might be dead made him want to go rescue him. The third reason I believe Mike went back was a sense of companionship. Even though Mike and Nicky had their disagreements they were great friends, both in the factory and at home. They did everything together, from getting drunk to weddings to hunting. The final piece that made Mike want to go back to Vietnam was when he saw all the money Nicky was sending to Steve. He wondered how he was getting all of the money, and realized it must be from a game called Russian roulette. Mike knew that Nicky was mentally unstable from seeing horrific events in Vietnam, and especially from the game of Russian roulette. The sad part of Mike trying to rescue Nicky, of course, is that Nicky is either so messed up that he can't, or he doesn't want to recognize Mike. In Nicky's final game of Russian Roulette he almost recognizes Mike, but it's too late and he fires the gun into his head. -- Alex Chase",

Mike went to go Steven and he could see that he seemed angry about what had happened to him. Mike convinced Steven to come back home. Mike then figured out that Nike was still in Vietnam. Linda was hurt that Nike didn't come home with Mike. So I think Mike went back to Vietnam to find Nike partly because Linda was depressed and he wanted to help her. Even though he definitely had a crush on Linda, he knew that Linda just wanted Nike back. Mike went to Vietnam for the second time now and paid a lot of money that he got from Steven to find Nike. When he found him in the Russian Roulette. You could tell that Nike was not that happy to see him. He looked horrible and was acting like he never even knew Mike. Mike and him sat at the table against each other and Mike kept saying ""Nicky, don't do it."" The first time it was fine but the second time Nike shot himself in the head.

It brought the men closer together and they went through something that changed what they think of when talking about war. When Nicky was taken back to that room where he first saw Russian roulette being played for money, he was shocked and after he saw Mike in there he became very angry. Mike went back to Vietnam after he came home, to get Nicky to come with him and understand that playing this game for money is wrong and not a way to live. I believe that the director was trying to show that the war was a scary time and that the two characters went through a lot because when they had to play each other in the Vietnam torcher camp, it was the hardest thing they have ever had to do and when they were at the table ready to play again it was like doing it all together and right before Nicky died he started to remember home and the earlier part of war.

And all of the personalities change by the end of the movie. The Main character is mike, who is played by Robert Di Niro has by far the strongest personality of the other character. He is very proper so to speak and mature compared to the other characters. He is a perfectonist, saying that you should kill a deer with one shot when all the other guys don't think that way. He seems to be kind of the leader of the group. This kind of personality would work well for anyone going into the army and it did for mike. While in battle Mike was ruthless and concentrated and he was calm and did not panic like the others. He thought clearly throughout the Russian roulette seen and he was the one who allowed them to escape and had to help the others along through Russian roulette. In war you need to have psychologically strong to be able to take in the horrors you see and Mike was one of them. After the war when mike came home he seemed a lot more quiet.

740,13 December 2017,rockymonet-56177,10, How A Foreign Game Killed Us All,"#2 The three main characters in ""The Deer Hunter"" have very different personalities which leads to different effects of their time in the war. Mike is a very linear, organized character which serves him well while he is in Vietnam. He manages to stay alive, unharmed physically, and protect the other characters to the best of his ability. When he returns from the war he is changed mentally. Mike had failed to bring Nick back with him as he had promised not to do. Between this broken promise, and the horrors he had to endure himself, Mike goes through minor mental changes when he returns. He holds a gun loaded with one bullet to his friend's head after he had been messing around with the loaded gun. Mike seems to have a minor case of PTSD involving guns. This is also seen when he purposefully misses shooting a deer. Nick was an emotional character from the beginning of the film. This trait served him well at home, but not in the war. Nick lost it when he was forced to play Russian Roulette for his life while he was a prisoner of war. This event had a severe impact on his life because it was his best friend, Mike, who forced him to do it so they could survive. Because he was such an emotional character, Nick was affected by the cruel game more than the others. Nick, unfortunately, did not make it home from the war. He spent his last few months at a Russian Roulette den in Saigon. He experimented with drugs and played the game because he was so far gone. in the end, it was the game that killed him. Steve was the third friend who went to Vietnam. Steve was a childish character before the war. He wasn't extremely mature or even aware of the world around him. This effected him terribly in the war. While playing Russian Roulette, Steve was crying and freaking out because it was so horrific to him. He was corrupted by the war and was forced to see and experience things he wasn't ready to experience. Steve was physically effected as well as mentally. He lost his legs and part of his arm during the war. All of these things that happened to the men because of the war could have been predicted to an extent. Mike is strong emotionally and physically, so he wouldn't be as effected by the war as most. Nick was emotional and therefore would be effected mentally. And Steve was the childish friend, so he would come out of the war different in some way. I don't think it could have happened another way. I wish Nick didn't have to die, but that was critical to the plot and outcome of the war on the men.",

When the war heroes come home it makes you wonder how much different your life would be when you got back like it was for those soldiers. The movie did a really good job of getting you to think about this stuff. when you see the way that the people have changed from beginning to end you really think about the people you are close with and it really is depressing to think that this stuff actually happens to people.

In The Deer Hunter, the Frenchman is symbolic of French involvement in Vietnam. The first time we are introduced to him is in Saigon when he lures Nick into the game of Russian Roulette. That is symbolic of the French originally drawing the United States into Vietnam. The second time we see him is towards the end of the film as Mike is searching for Nick in Saigon to bring him home. Mike finds the Frenchman who pretends not to know what is going on and has no involvement. The same happened to the United States struggles towards the end of the war while the French claim they had no connection.

In The Deer Hunter, the French man could be seen as representing the government of the United States. Just as he lured Nick into competing at Russian Roulette with his fancy car and promises of money and fame, the U.S. government was luring in young men by glamorizing the war, and the benefits. However, behind the glamor of the romanticized view of war provided by the government lurked the dark truth of the matter, just like with the Russian Roulette in the movie. Like the shooting game, the war was also a lose-lose situation for the drafted soldiers. They had two options. One was to fight, and be either killed, wounded, or emotionally scarred and traumatized. The other option was to dodge the draft, probably be labeled a coward, arrested, and generally shunned by society.

On the other hand, he is somewhat jealous of Nick because of Nick's ease with the ladies and his skill in dancing that Mike does not possess. Inside, however, Mike is ultimately a good man, who only wishes the best for his friends even though he may be jealous of them. Nick is a man who is small in stature, but big in confidence. He has good social skills and more emotion than Mike that allow him to be popular with the ladies and his friends alike.

This is especially true for the Vietnam war, which added up to an alarming fatality number.It was the most brutal of any other war, and was an era of which many took part in heinous games such as Russian Roulette. I think he did a great job inferring the hell of war.",

762,21 December 2008,ari_b,7, Answer to #4,"Q: Why did Mike go back to Vietnam for Nick? First off, Mike had promised Nick he wouldn't leave him in Vietnam. So, it was an unspoken consent that he would take him back dead or alive. Second, Mike surely needed closure. He had no idea where Nick was exactly, or whether he was alive. He had to find out the truth. He cared about him a lot, considering the friendship we see among the man before they leave for war. They depend on each other, and Mike seems to have always felt responsible for the men. He seemed to have the most clear mind, and wanted to fix whatever mistakes had been made. His method of living is to do something right the first time, but of course his friends didn't act in exactly the same way.",
763,21 December 2008,rafferty2891,7, #2,"The different personalities of the three characters definitely lead up to what happens to them in Vietnam and afterwards. Mike is by far the most prepared for Vietnam. Before they leave, he doesn't seem apprehensive like Nick or terrified like Steve. He seems stoic and prepared. This leads to him being the the most normal after the war. He is also the most productive soldier of the three of them in Vietnam. To me, Nick seemed like he was very emotional, and prone to more emotional damage than Mike. He couldn't deal with what happened, so he turned to opiates and playing Russian Roulette. Steve was the least prepared to be a soldier. He was clearly scared out of his mind about going to war, and this was most evident when he was forced to play Russian roulette. He was crying and could not bring himself to shoot at himself directly, unlike Mike and Nick. He also could not keep himself on the helicopter, which lead to the amputation of his legs. Of the three, Mike was the only one who even remotely belonged in Vietnam.",

Stevie, one of Mike's friends, lost both of his legs during the war and Nike was still in Vietnam. Although he was still in Vietnam, he was sending high amounts of money to Stevie. Mike found out where his friend, whom he missed a lot, was and the money he had been sending to Stevie. I believe not only did he want to see want to bring his long-lost friend back home, but was also concerned about how Nike was getting so much money in Vietnam. I also think Mike knew Nike would be a danger to himself because of what the war did to him and didn't want him taking his own life.",
765,23 December 2008,tbeeler09,7, Film's agenda gets in the way,"There are many things that The Deer Hunter does well. For instance, it does an unparalleled job of showing the emotional aspect of Vietnam. However, the director's agenda seems to get in the way of the film's overall outcome. It seems the point of the movie is being forced on us. And while it is a perfectly legitimate one, and one that needs to be made, it is often awkwardly implicated. For example, the very last sceneintended to be ironic and morose, it comes off as an almost laughable and completely unbelievable end to a story based on truth. It is no secret how the filmmakers feel about the war. From the graphic depictions of violence to the intense emotional transformations of the characters, it is clear from the first shot how we, the audience, are supposed to feel.",
766,30 December 2008,bajunis,7, #4 Why does Mike go back to Vietnam to find Nicky?,"I believe that this sequence goes back to when Nicky, at Steve's wedding, demanded that Mike bring him back home, no matter what happened. Mike made the vow in that scene, and eventually kept it by the end. But, the idea of ""no matter what happens"" goes back to the scene where Mike and Nicky face off in Russian Roulette and Mike decides that there needs to be more bullets. Nicky immediately thinks that Mike is insane but he manages to get Nicky and himself up out of the pit. So they get the three bullets and begin the roulette, but there is a reason. Mike is willing to do anything to get out of the P.O.W. pit and save his friends (i.e. wedding scene) because that was his mission. ""One shot"". He only had that one chance to get out of there.",

When Mike initially comes home, Nike stays behind in Saigon to play Russian roulette. Mike goes on a hunting trip, yet he does not shoot the deer he finds, because he is a firm believer in doing things to the best of his ability, and he is haunted by his conscience for leaving Nike. He feels as though he has violated this principle by leaving Vietnam without bringing Nike home. Thus he returns to Saigon at a great personal risk and financial cost to find Nike. When Mike finally sees Nike, he finds that Nike has gone insane from the stress of combat and torture. In an effort to bring Nike back to his senses, Mike plays Russian roulette with him, which ultimately culminates with Nike's suicide. Feeling a great debt to his friend, Mike brings Nike's body back home for burial.",

As they leave for Vietnam Nicky tells Mike to make a promise that no matter what, he wouldn't leave him over in Vietnam. But Nicky and Steve end up in the same platoon and Mike is left a loner. The three of them reunite only to be capture by Vietnamese soldiers and forced to play Russian Roulette. They narrowly escape and are rescued by an American helicopter, Nicky climbs aboard, but Mike and Steve end up plummeting into the river. Mike stays with Steve until he comes across a group of fleeing Vietnamese citizens, at which point he gives Steve to the medic and continues wondering in search of Nicky. Mike ends up seeing Nicky in the Russian Roulette den in Saigon, but as he tries to talk to him Nicky rides away with the Frenchman. This is where I think Mike went wrong. He leaves for home without Nick even after he promises that he wouldn't. Even though it is never said in the film I believe that Nicky knew Mike had left without him. Mike falls in love with Nicky's girlfriend but can not allow himself to be intimate with her until he either talks it over with Nick or finds out that Nick is dead. He then goes back to Saigon and finds Nicky playing Russian Roulette. After much negotiating and a heavy fee Mike sits across the table from Nicky. Both of them knowing that one of them is going to die. Sadly Nicky ends up shooting himself, at which point I think Mike is grief struck, but somewhat relieved. He returns home with Nicky and the services are held, but in the end it seems that Nick's girlfriend has somewhat of a grudge against Mike, as if it were his fault that Nick was shot. So in the end Mike went back to Saigon to keep his promise and bring Nick home, but if you ask me I don't believe his home life will ever be the same after this happening.",

They are captured during the fight and are held in a POW camp in Northern Vietnam. At the camp they are forced to play Russian Roulette against the Vietcong.

776,15 December 2009,elizabethfsc,8, my class view,i really liked this movie out of all the ones that we watched.. i think that Micheal is the one that came out of the war emotionally because he seemed normal but when you looked closer at his character you can tell that there is something wrong with him... i think that Nikki is the one that came out psychological because when mike goes back for him he doesn't even act like he know's who he is.. then he dies.. and i think that Steve came out definitely physically messed up he had no legs and one of his arms was all messed up.. the movie was really good though i thought that after mike came back from trying to get Nikki he should have tried to get with the girl that he loved.. you could tell that he wanted to be with her and he didn't want to mess up his friendship with his house-mate but Nikki was dead it shouldn't have mattered.. i also think that during the war scenes hey should have showed more if what was going on.. like I'm not the kinda girl who likes war movies but they could have given more details about what happened.. hope you like it and hope i get a good grade!!,
777,15 December 2009,kerimorris2468,10, The Deer Hunter,"I thought that the movie was great. But it was sad as well. At the end of the movie I had to admit that I did tears in my eyes. But I had loved the way that they had shown the deer in the movie. Also I had hated the fact that Nike, Mike, and Steve had to play the stupid games that the Russin Rouletts had made them play. I believe the reason why Mike had went back to Vietnam to get Nike is because before that they had went to Vietnam they had said ""Don't leave me there! You better come back and get me."" So when they had made that promise Mike knew where Steve was so he had figured out that Nike was still there he had to go back and get him. But when he had found Nike he had tried to convince Nike that he had to go home. But Nike had refused because he was just so use to the Russin Rouletts that Nike was basically brain washed that he just didn't realized who his friends were and where home really was. So to make things short, Mike had to go back to Vietnam to go find Nike to tie up some loose ends.",

782,6 January 2010,KDucharme92,8," Answer to Craven, once again :)","#4. Why does Mike go back to Vietnam to find Nicki? Be specific with this one and use examples Mike goes back to Vietnam to find Nicki because he is a man that sticks to what he says. Before he left he said that he wouldn't leave without Nicki so he didn't. Throughout the movie, many examples of this are portrayed. Before their friend gets married, Mike reminds the groom that he needs to iron his tux. Mike has always and will always follow the rules and follow through with what he says. Another example is how the viewers of the movie know that Mike has feelings for Nicki's girlfriend, but like usual, he would NEVER do something like that to Nicki and take her away, so once again, he does nothing about it. Mike is the type of guy who, if made a promise, will completely stick with it. He is very all too himself, and strict. Nicki is one of his best friends, and with his type of personality, if he promised he wouldn't leave Nicki in Vietnam, you better believe he wouldn't even dare to NOT go back. Mike is a rule follower and very much so sticks to his word. These examples show that.",
783,18 December 2009,kosei_carty,9," Question 1: Symbolism, Many Hidden Themes","Like others before have reiterated, there was no good way to come out of the Vietnam War unscathed. The Russian roulette sequence provided me with a very keen sense of what the film was about. When the POW's play the game--some of them dying immediately, others later on, etc.-- one can deduce that every single one of them will come to a demise sooner or later. It is a game that quite simply cannot be won. Symbolically speaking, every option that a drafted soldier had could not lead to good long-term results. Draft dodgers were looked down upon and couldn't return to the U.S., and those that did go to Vietnam never came back the same, with emotional, psychological, and/or physical scarring. One brilliant way that the director illustrates this is the connection that is created between the Russian roulette playing experiences of Nicky, Steven and Mike, and the future in store for them near the end and after the war. When Steve plays, he narrowly avoids death as the bullet barely grazes his head, leaving him visibly injured, but alive. As punishment for surviving, he is thrown in a cage, left to maybe die. After the war, Steven's legs are amputated, and he is ""caged"" to a limited, undesirable life he is forced to live, in a wheelchair. When Mike plays the game, nothing visibly harmful happens to him, and he helps everyone escape alive, but ironically, he suffers excessive emotional stress issues after the war. Emotions were pent up and problematic for many people after the war, even though they were physically well. Lastly, Nicky survives POW-Russian roulette to play another day, and again, ironically, he appears to suffer the most trauma playing the first time, being unable to pull the trigger on many occasions, but he strangely continues to play Russian roulette after the war is nearly over. He psychologically unravels as his rather long career progresses, until he goes for ""one more shot,""--something Mike said to Nicky before they ambushed the Viet captors-- and ends up killing himself.",

When you go to war, if you're there long enough you're bound to come back scarred emotionally, physically, or psychologically. you can't be at war and it not have some sort of effect with you. Same goes for Russian roulette; if you play the game long enough, you're going to die. When it come to patriotism, in almost all wars one is going to fight for a reason to defend & fight for their country.

788,4 May 2010,thhammer-729-925518,6, deer hunter question 1,i think that the Russian runlet part of the movie is showing the risk that is taken when you are in a situation where a war like Vietnam is going on. What i mean by this is that if you are drafted and you do not go you risk jail time and being looked at as a traitor which can cause a lot of emotional and mental damage. Although if you did go you would see things that could cause you to loose your mind or worse kill you. Where in a game of Russian runlet if they did not play they were killed but if they played they would eventually be killed by the bullet. Also at the end of the movie where he is playing it shows that some one who went throughout the ordeal that they did could just give up on life and not care what happens to them. It also shows that some of the people were unable to live with them self to the point where they don't even want family or friends to ever see them the way they are and will choose death over life.,

He does things in the most efficient and direct way possible, and logically he keeps his promises. So, after Nicky has asked that Michael not leave him behind in Vietnam, the no-nonsense Michael feels bound to follow through on Nicky's request. Even if it means risking his own life. After losing Nicky in the underworld of collapsing Saigon, Michael returns home. Although not acted upon before leaving for war, Michael's romantic relationship with Linda becomes more real and physical with the absence of Nick. However, Michael feels uncomfortable being in a relationship with Linda since she was Nick's girlfriend and the condition of Nick is unknown. Since he can't really put himself entirely into a relationship with Linda without closure from Nicky and because of his promise to Nicky, he is forced to go back to Vietnam to bring him back home.",

They need the risk, the possibility that their life could end for a simple game. Nick thrived on that concept. If their lives could be worth that little, and could be thrown away so easily, it was in their own power that they controlled what went on around them. To the point of life versus death. The game taunts the horrors that the men went through while in POW camps. Because they were forced to play by the prison guards, and risk their lives for the amusement of a bet, to them, their lives became a little less meaningful. If these men, who only wanted their death for amusement, could have that much power with so little thought, then why couldn't the men do that themselves? For they would rather have at least a little control and take the risk on their own, play the game for their amusement, and wash their own lives down the drain.",

Did their different approaches towards life serve as an accurate prelude to what was to happen? Could it have happened differently? Between the three of them they all had different personalities. Mike was a brute. He was loud and outgoing. He wanted things done right the first time and he wanted them done his way. Mike was strong willed and determined. At times he seemed to be a jerk but he was ultimately very nice, he just had a rough exterior. Nick was kind. He was gentle and in my opinion not built for war. He sort of went with the flow of things and just followed what everyone else was up to. Nick was strong but not in the way Mike was. Steve by no means was built for war. He was a very emotional guy. He just wanted to have fun and that's what he liked to do. When put into the Vietnam war, he got a overwhelmed with things. He wasn't emotionally strong and he couldn't handle the trauma. With each personality it showed how they dealt with going to war and the outcome of their time served. Mike was strong all the way through. He knew what he had to do to survive and he was willing to do it. He made the plans and Steve and Nick went with it. He told them what they had to do in order to survive. Mike was what kept them both going. He had his mind set on getting out so he created ways to escape. Nick was cautious with the plans Mike had, but he did them because he knew what Mike said was probably the safest bet. Steve didn't want to do it. Once they got captured and had to play Russian Roulette the first time he wanted to give up. His personality wasn't made for it and it showed as he cried. of course it is a horrible situation to be in and I would cry as well, but most people who now join the army are prepared to do those things. Although it's not certain whether any of them chose or not, Steve was not prepared. Mike was the leader and that is what his personality was. He told them what to do and they followed it even though at times they questioned him. They all suffered in the end. Mike was just angry after. He tried hard to stay calm and not show weakness but, he had enough and it was hard for him. Sometimes he exploded but it was usually kept under control. He just wanted to find his friends and find out they were okay. The way Steve ended up didn't surprise me. He was the weak link from the beginning and I at first didn't even think he'd survive. The War broke him and you could tell. He was both physically and mental different. Nick tried hard throughout the whole war to be strong. He almost forced his courage and in the end when they were out he went crazy. It was almost like he pushed himself off the edge. He tried to be too much like Mike and what Mike could handle, he couldn't.",
797,10 May 2010,alexmitchell5792,6, The Russian Roulette scene,"the Russian Roulete scene is a pivotal point in the film. The scene depicts the men changing and adapting to better their chances at surviving Vietnam. Using this particular means of torture, created a picture of how intense and violent the Vietnam War really was. The director wanted to capture this along with showing th ways in which the characters have changed. It was Mike's quick thinking that got the unlucky trio out of the POW camp. His by the book attitude, needed to quickly change if he was to survive his capture. His choice to try and fight his captures was unorthodox, as P.O.W's usually try to wait for help to arrive. Nick who is usually laid back and easy going must assist Mike in his attempts to kill his captures. Nick realizes that the only way to survive is to control your own destiny, and not to wait for the help of others to bail you out. Steve is the one member of the trio that doesn't quite adapt to the Vietnam lifestyle. It is only by Mike's will, that Steve survives his Russian Roulete game. Mike urges him on throughout the ordeal. When Steve finally does pull the trigger, he nearly ends his own life. After this scene it is Mike who carries Steve out of the jungle and to safety.",
798,10 May 2010,jbabcock-735-772076,7, film studies review,I think that Russian Roulette is used as a symbol of chance in this film. The guys knew from the start that most likely they were not all going to make it back and the game is a game of chance except in the end almost everyone dies..which is every realistic because so many lives were actually taken. So i think the director was trying to show how horrible it really was over there and how much the soldiers were put through..but also that almost 50% of the men that left never came home. I agree with the fact that he used the game to represent the war..it was chance you go and return or you go and die just like pulling the trigger you either live or die.,

Many Patriots who fought in the war began to question why in fact they were there. To many it seemed like playing a stupid game where you might not come home. It was impossible to win. I don't think that Russian roulette was a wildly popular as it was depicted in Saigon. Regardless, the message sent to the viewer is astonishing.

On the night of the wedding, Mike runs naked through the streets while Nick chases him down. Mike finally becomes exhausted and stops at a local basketball court, there he lays down against the net's base and looks at the stairs. Nick catches up to Mike and joins him against the net's base. As they begin to finally talk, Nick begs Mike to not leave him over there, in Vietnam, if anything were to happen to him. Mike, as a good friend, promises Nick this. Mike protects Nick in time of despair throughout the movie. Mike saved Nick from being a POW and got him to US Forces after, however they are unable to join up and Mike has no idea if Nick is still in Vietnam or back in the States. Later, Mike spots Nick at a Russian Roulette game, and rushes through the crowd to meet up with Nick. This is unsuccessful as a wealthy French business man escorts Nick out and drives away. Mike goes back to America, without Nick, and feels like he failed his friend because Nick is not there with them and Nick is thought of as AWOL and could be dead.

802,12 December 2010,mpro1993,10, Film Studies Thing.,"1. I thought that adding Russian Roulette to the plot was a good idea because it showed that no matter what soldiers who went to Vietnam did it was a losing game. If they stayed then they betray their country and if they left and came home then they'd be criticized for going. They could die or be captured in Vietnam. With Russian Roulette it's kind of the same thing, if you play it you may win but eventually you'll lose, and in losing you'll die. ",

He is wearing white when he first appears to show some kind of holiness i guess. After talking with Nicky, he starts to give him money and riches and all the things he could have ever wanted.

And this is shown when mike was fighting and nick and Stevie landed and you could tell they were fresh out of basic and mike has been fighting for some time now. Now Mike is sent home and they have a huge party for him but he chooses not to go because you know there all going to ask about nick and he knows that he is still over there. He stays around town for awhile and becomes closer to Linda but he knows nick is still alive and he cant seem to make a pass at Linda. And when hes home we see this bugs him that nicks over there. when he goes to see Stevie Stevie shows him the package that someone from Saigon sends him every month. When Stevie tells mike that Saigon might fall any day mike goes back to Vietnam to bring nick home. He knows that he has to keep his promise to nick. Because that's the way mike is.

It is clear that they were great friends, and Mike could not live with himself if he just left him there. Also, Mike specifically made a promise that he would not leave Nick in Vietnam before they left. Mike is the type of person that if he says he is going to do something, he is going to do everything he can to get it done. We already know that Mike is the leader of the group, so he probably feels somewhat responsible that Nick was left behind in the first place. In the end, Mike just wanted to get his friend back and have it be the same as it was before they left for war.",
828,18 December 2011,njfiel15,8, #4 Why Mike goes back to Vietnam,"The main reason why Mike went back to Vietnam is because he made the promise to Nick that he would go back. After going through everything with the Russian Roulette at the POW camp and being separated from each other; there was no way Mike could do that to Nick. You can definitely tell how strong their friendship is because Nick trusts Mike when they play Russian Roulette. The amount of trust that is needed to agree on something in a situation like that is unreal. Both of them easily could've been killed if Nick had not agreed to put in the extra bullets. When Mike finds out about Nick's whereabouts, he knows that he must go back to save his friend. Since Mike is familiar with the area and situation Nick is in, he knows Nick will soon be in trouble. When Nick sends the money from his winnings to Steve Mike knows that he is still alive and there is a chance to save him. I think that Mike also feels guilty that he couldn't do enough to get his friends to come back to America with him, especially Nick. Steve is one of his good friends but Mike and Nick clearly are closer. I think the fact that Mike goes back to America and is also living with Nick's girlfriend, Linda, puts some guilt on Mike. Mike also has feelings for Linda but will never try and get in the way of Linda and Nick because of his friendship with Nick. Even when Mike is in America living with Linda, he won't try to act on anything even though it's obvious that Linda is attracted to Mike. Mike is very loyal to his friends and he had one responsibility when he went to Vietnam and that was to make sure Nick, Steve, and himself come back alive. He feels as though he lost a friend when Nick isn't in America with him, even when he didn't know the status of Nick. When he ends up going back to Vietnam, they show how much Nick means to Mike because of the situation Mike puts himself in to save Nick's life. Mike could have died right there at the table but it was too late. Nick clearly isn't emotionally healthy but Mike tries so hard to fix that before Nick ends up leaving him.",

But along with him is his best friend Nicky. Towards the end of the war, Nicky gets separated in Saigon and meets up with a rich Frenchman who runs an underground Russian Roulet den. This French character gets rich of running this gambling hall. Since colonial times, the French have had a major influence on the region and took over most of southern Asia. The French have always held power over the Vietnamese, so this is why the French man has power over the rest of the people. This character symbolizes the fall of a French Vietnam. One of the reasons that the United States entered the war was to help out France, but it the end it just back fired. This is the same thing that happened to Nicky in Saigon. Overall, I think this is a very good film. Rober De Niro did a great job in this movie.",
830,18 December 2011,emmamagee14,9, Answer to question #4,"In the film 'The Deer Hunter,' Mike, (played by Robert De Niro), is a very interesting character to analyze. He is trust-worthy, more serious than the rest of the guys in his group of friends, sensible, smart, loyal and very linear in his thinking of the way things ought to get done and how the world works around him. After his friend Steve's wedding, Mike, drunk as a skunk, streaks down the streets of Clairton, Pennsylvania, only to be chased by his best friend Nick, (played by Christopher Walken). After exhaustion finally sets in, Mike collapses and Nick catches up to him, putting his jacket over Mike's naked body and sitting down with him to discuss his fears of going to Vietnam to fight in the war. At one point, Nick makes Mike promise not to leave him in Vietnam, to which Mike half-heartedly promises, not knowing anything about what might happen or where the pair of friends will end up. Once in Vietnam, a series of horrendous events ensue, and their friendship is put to the test. Mike and Nick escape their captors, who forced them to play Russian Roulette for the first time against each other, and then were separated when Nick made it onto a rescue helicopter and Mike did not. That was the last time they saw each other before Mike travels back to Vietnam to look for Nick, who never actually made it home and hasn't been seen since. Mike goes back for Nick because of his linear thinking and the promise he made to him before they left to fight in the war. Mike believes that a person should perform tasks in order, and finish a task before going on to the next one. When he comes home and the gang goes hunting a second time without Nick, he lets a buck, who he could've easily shot and killed, get away because of his guilt for leaving Nick over in Vietnam and the realization that the buck isn't really meant to be shot just yet, since he made the promise to Nick first. Nick is also his best friend and he knows that the right thing to do would be to go and find out what happened to him and bring him home if he's even still alive. It's part of Mike's personality and he would never let Nick stay in Vietnam when he promised he'd never leave him there in the first place.",

When Nick told Mike he couldn't abandon him in Vietnam, Mike promised he wouldn't. It turned out to be an empty promise, as they were separated during the war, and Nick was left behind while Mike went home. Mike didn't give up, though, and went back to Vietnam to find Nick. Mike had a very linear way of thinking, and he couldn't leave this particualar order of business unfinished.

Nick feels that his life isn't worth anything and he knows that he cant go back to living a normal life after what he has seen in the war.

Mike knows that Nick is still there because of the money that he was sending to America. Mike also knows the terrible way that Nick is getting this money, Russian Roulette.

It also wasn't just that he had left Nick behind he also did'nt know what had happened to him until he visited Steve and saw all the money Nick had been sending him from winning in Russian Roulette.

People cared about Nick and Mike felt as it is his job to find him and bring him home. When Mike finds Nick and Nick doesn't want to come home, it was because of how angry Mike had made him.

He felt like since he left Nick in Vietnam, he couldn't be happy, and go on with his life. He's the kind of guy who always does things in order.

843,15 December 2013,cmbark19,8, Russian Roulette Symbolism,"#1. The symbolism for the Russian Roulette sequences. What was the director trying to get at? Do you agree or disagree with his concept? Nick's infatuation with Russian Roulette comes from the game of Russian Roulette he played with Mike to save their lives. After the two become separated, Nick is left in Vietnam with nothing to do. Suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, he becomes interested in playing Russian Roulette for money. In a sense, it becomes the only thing he knows, and something he is used to, thus he keeps playing. This symbolizes America's quest for war, because Post- World War II America was still shell-shocked, but had grown accustomed to war. Therefore, America tried to spread Western Democracy to places where we didn't necessarily have to get involved. Yet, just like Nicky and Russian Roulette, America keeps loading the gun, and putting their lives on the line, because it's the only thing America knows. I completely agree with the concept, because our infatuation with patriotism becomes a mandatory quest to prove ourselves in the only way we know.",

Mike also found out that Niki was still alive when he went to visit Stevie. I felt so bad when he went to Vietnam and Niki killed himself in front of him. Niki and Mike were friend and room mates they went hunting together and drank together and also said that they would die together if they had to. so he had to go and help Niki. the only problem was he had been on a lot of drugs so he couldn't remember who Mike was. Mike tried to save him but couldn't. If both Mike and Niki came back they would have been different and would react different to things.,
847,27 April 2008,mistermagoo12,10, Absolutely not the best Vietnam movie,"I'm just responding to the claim that this is the best Vietnam movie... There are plenty of other movies about Vietnam that are better than ""the Deer Hunter,"" ""Full metal Jacket,""Apacolypse Now"" Are two I can think of off the top of my head. Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing movie. The only problem I have is that the beginning of the film, where the director is trying to establish what a small industrial town is like. is very long and drawn out. However, in the end, you do end up understanding why that was done. This film is not the best Vietnam movie because it doesn't really have much about the war and how U.S. soldiers treated the Vietnamese, which did vary. Overall, this is a great film, and I do recommend it!",

On all three of those criticisms they are mostly correct. However I do not think this movie could've been made any better. I myself am a soldier, I have fought in Iraq. In my opinion this movie captures the relationships of friends before, during, and after the war. This movie isn't about the Vietnam war, the war is merely a backdrop. After decades of WW2 films, especially considering that most were cheesy action flicks, Hollywood directors needed a new war to use for their pictures. Vietnam made the most sense because most of the movie going public was old enough to identify with that war. ",

The game of Russian roulette is a perfect example of such dehumanization.

During the hostage scene while Robert Deniro (mike) and Christopher Walken (nick) are forced to play at gun point. Nick goes into a panic attack as he is forced to play, he was always a risk taker but now that he realizes his life is in danger he buckles under the pressure and cant take it. Mike tries to talk him through it as the gun is forced into nicks hand and the trigger is pulled. The directors choice in sound is a fantastic feature, the much anticipated click of the hammer, followed by the thump of the barrel rolling into place adds an extreme amounts of suspense that you can know will build up to a sudden and untimely demise. The director uses this scene to display the cruelty and dehumanization in guerrilla warfare. cruelty that can be used for recreational purposes amongst the ranks. ",

However, after many years it now seems this movie is a typical liberal distortion of what really happened in Vietnam. While I'm sure some were deeply affected by their experience, the notion of being forced to play Russian roulette is absurd. All veterans I've heard discuss this say they never ever heard that being done. One veteran i talked with told me that ..""think about it..if your captured in war, your captures are not gonna put a loaded weapon in your hand"". Seems all the films of Vietnam try to portray all who served there as crazy, bizarre,helpless damaged individuals who couldn't cope and that simply was just not true. I mean really...staying in Vietnam and becoming a ""professional Russian roulette player""??? The overwhelming majority of those who served there did honorably and with distinction.As for the film, while there are some fine performances by the actors, there are serious flaws in the story.

861,8 January 2013,ddamato95,7, Response # 2,"Michael, Steven, and Nick are three friends who work in a factory during the Vietnam war. Surrounded by other friends and a familiar group and town, they live life relatively carefree, until they enlist and are sent to Vietnam, shortly after Steven's wedding. Nick is easygoing and relaxed, all about having fun and taking life as it comes. He is the only character that really understands and respects Mike's quiet, surly manner, and Mike went as far as to say that NIck is the only one he would trust to take deer hunting. Mike is by far the most serious. He may laugh or joke at times, but he knows what needs to be done and who needs to do it. Steven is more of a nervous fellow who cannot stand up under pressure. The wife he married was already pregnant, and he did it more for her sake than his. Entering Vietnam, these differences definitively shaped their experiences and reactions to those experiences. After being assigned to separate units for a while, the three meet up after a town has been raided in the jungle. Unfortunately, they are captured and brought to a Vietcong camp nearby on the river. Here the prisoners are forced to play Russian roulette (while not historically accurate, this serves to show the chance-like quality of the war). Under the pressure, Steven snaps and is left to die. Mike argues with Nick and convinces him to risk his life in extreme circumstance to try to escape. After a painful round of Russian roulette, they escape and are rescued by an American helicopter, but split up during the recovery. Mike goes home without Nick, and although he has certainly lost his innocence he is able to still move on. Steven refuses to leave his hospital bed, and can no longer face the world, just as he has never been able to stand up to things outside of his control. Nick stayed in Vietnam and continued to play Russian Roulette until it eventually killed him. He always was the most optimistic, innocent, and willing to take risks, and Vietnam killed him, if not physically, in the end. Innocence was lost with the war and Nick symbolizes the loss of innocence and optimism, only the methodical and strong such as Mike were able to survive.",

When the VCs for mike and nick to play Russian rullet they never fully recover from it even though they returned alive.

When Mike returned to the United States he hid from his friends who tried to throw him a party. This showed that he may have felt guilty about coming home without Nick. I think that he may have thought that his friends would have been disappointed with him when they found that he came back without Nick. Linda would be especially disappointed because she was in love with Nick. His friends may have even thought that he had an obligation to return with Nick and Steve or not return at all. Another example of Mike possibly feeling guilty is the fact that as soon as he heeded that Steve was alive, he rushed to find him and ask him if he knew anything about Nick. Another reason why he may have wanted to go back is because he saw Nick before leaving in the first place playing Russian roulette with the French Man.",

Isn't it more a movie about friendship and the distances one must go to maintain connections with those one finds important? MICHAEL makes it painfully clear in the early scene when he tells NICK: (paraphrase) ""If it weren't for you, I would go it alone."" ""ONE SHOT, ONE KILL"" -- an extended metaphor? Whether in the mountains of PA, or the back alleys of Saigon (shooting deer, or shooting oneself), life is portrayed as tragically transient -- something to be protected and cherished, rather than squandered and taken for granted.

869,15 December 2013,hchen9696,8, Russian Roulette #1,"Whether one likes to view The Deer Hunter as a drawn-out war film or a huge allegory to the dehumanization of a conflict that had the logical premise, the concept and action of Russian Roulette is a huge part of the film. Russian Roulette is a lose-lose situation. No matter how long you survive, you will die eventually. The first sequence of Russian Roulette was shown through Mike and Nick's perspective as they were forced to play against each other. It was eventually Mike's swift actions that allowed him and Nick to escape with Steve. The symbolism of Russian Roulette is exactly the same thing for the United States. If we went to war and we ""won"", we would lose so many lives in the process for the title of victor in a pointless war of attrition. If we lost, we would still lose many American lives in the process and the trust in the government from the pubic's perspective would heavily damaged. What the film was trying to depict was that Vietnam was a long drawn-out version of Russian Roulette, especially for the veterans. The veterans that sacrificed everything would be scolded and criticized for doing something they had no choice in. In both Russian Roulette and the Vietnam War, whether the prize is winning a war between Communism and Democracy, or in Nick's case-making money and getting high-there is no true victory; there is only loss.",

The last night before the war, the men all attend Steve's wedding as a final goodbye. The men consume much alcohol and enjoy themselves while they still can. The following morning, they plan to go hunting together for the last time before the war. It is here in the film when the men express affection they have towards one another. Nick, being the sensitive one, opens up to his boys. He explains how much he loves his average life and his average income. Additionally, he states his love towards his friends and towards the life he lives. He loves working with his friends, hunting with his friends and so on. He then asks Mike to make a promise to him. The promise is that no matter what, he will not leave Nick in Vietnam. Mike accepts. Once Steve leaves the war on injury and Mike gets shot in order to return home, Nick is stranded in Vietnam playing Russian Roulette for money. He doesn't do this consciously however.

871,12 December 2013,dckane34,8," Different Personalities of Nick, Mike and Steve","Nick, Mike, and Steve all played somewhat archetypal characters in their roles as members of the tightly knit friend group The Deer Hunter follows. Mike plays the left brained, organized, orderly, powerful leader of the group. Mike is well respected by everyone, hes somewhat quiet, and hes the best hunter of them all. In general, what Mike says, goes. This serves him very well as a soldier in Vietnam. He is able to keep a level head when in extreme situations, such as when he was a POW and used Russian Roulette to evade his captors. Mike was the only one of the three men to come out of Vietnam whole, and that makes sense when you look at his strong personality. Steve was quite the opposite. It was evident from the beginning that Steve wasn't as strong as Mike or Nick. He married a woman who was pregnant with another mans child, which would have been a sign of shame and weakness in those times. He also seemed very uncomfortable with going to Vietnam and freaked out when he was taken captive. It also makes sense that Steve would be the one to lose his legs, given his weak personality. Nick fell somewhere in the middle of the two. Nick was gregarious, funny, very well liked, happy and charming. He told Mike that he loved his life as a steel mill worker ,and made Mike promise not to leave him in Vietnam. Nicks strengths and courage kept him alive for a while with a little help from Mike, but ultimately he succumbed to the extreme circumstances. Nick was the most psychologically damaged of the three after the war. It makes sense that Nick, the one who loved the beautiful life he lived before, would be so traumatized by all the atrocities he witnessed and took part in. The games of Russian Roulette drove Nick to the point that he didn't value his life and was willing to keep playing for money. His Heroin use also probably played a role. I know you said in class that there was an alternate ending where Nick and Mike switch roles, but i definitely prefer it the way it is. It would be out of character for Mike to be the one who goes crazy and needs to be rescued. Although the ending was terribly sad, (as was the entire movie), I really enjoyed watching it and wouldn't want to see it changed.",

At first, the man lures Nick into the den and gets him to join, like how France, being an ally of the U.S., brought America into the Vietnam war. However, when the den becomes dangerous, the man abandons it and, in a way, leaves Nick for dead. While it's not necessarily true, the film is essentially saying that France got the U.S. into Vietnam and then left without trying to get them back out. I'm not entirely certain if the director was trying to blame France for the troubles in Vietnam, but it certainly seems to be the case. One way or the other, once Nick (America) is in, the only way out is to lose.",
873,14 December 2013,jsdfilm4,7, Long but Worth It,"I went into The Deer Hunter expecting it to be another war movie but left very shocked. The Deer Hunter starts off very slowly in America and follows the three main characters Mike, Steve and Nick. A large portion of the movie is spent outside of Vietnam and is used to develop the three characters which the audience soon grows attached to. The majority of said development takes place during Steve's wedding and a hunting expedition. A major part of the development of their characters is used to point out their character flaws. Steve's flaw is the most obvious and can be seen during the wedding sequence. Steve marries a pregnant woman and admits to his friends that the child is not his. While it may not appear like much, in the context of The Deer Hunter, Steve's naiveté will prove to be a weakness during war. Nick's also exhibits his character flaw during the wedding when he proposes to his girlfriend. By showing the audience Nick's compassion, it is implied that he will have other things on his mind which could get him killed. Mike appears to be the only character without a major flaw. He is independent, which can be seen in his interactions with his friends during the deer hunt. He appears to hold enough responsibility which foreshadows his success in Vietnam. Due to their traits one can assume that Steve and Nick will suffer from some sort of physical or emotional pain during the movie. Unfortunately, this foreshadowing proves to be true. Steve suffers from a crippling injury which leaves him restricted to a wheelchair. Nick suffers from a psychological injury which is a result of playing Russian roulette in a POW camp. It is clear that it troubles Mike to see his best friends suffer and the director does a good job of making the audience feel the same way. The long and tedious opening scenes initially appear redundant but it is not until the end of the film that the audience appreciates the strong development of the three characters that occurs during this time. If The Deer Hunter had not spent as much time on the character development, Nick's death would not have shocked me as much as it did.",

We Americans do not realize that just fighting in the war was the beginning of a long and stressful game of Russian Roulette. The revolver was counting down to that last bullet. We lost more money in that war than any war, that was also another factor in our loss. Another factor is that in Russian roulette your going to lose either way, and when Mike was playing with nick in the end of the movie, he realized that Nick had died for nothing because we had later lost the war. All around I thought that this movie was great because it revealed that any man can be broken by war in their way.",
875,15 December 2013,evilleneuve18,7, Symbolism for the Russian Roulette Sequences,"By including the Russian roulette sequences in the film among the prisoners, the director was trying to make a political statement about the war in Vietnam. If you went, there was a very good chance you could die. If you went and somehow survived, you would have psychological wounds (such as PTSD). If you did not go and stayed home, you would be jailed. If you ran away from home, to Canada for instance, you would have to leave your life and family behind. All of these scenarios are undesirable but you had to choose. The Vietnam War forced men to play Russian roulette with their own lives. The director included this to give the viewer a feel for how it might have felt for someone in the time period.",

Before they went, Nick gave a little speech expressing that none of their friend group would ever leave one another behind. The harsh nature of battle left Mike a little scrambled mentally as he showed when avoiding going straight home when he first got back so he clearly still had the tragedies of war on his mind. Another reason he went back was for a sense of closure seeing how the last time Mike saw Nick, he was indeed alive and then the money that was coming to Steve from Nick acted as the road flare to Nick's life. On top of the friend to friend obligation comes the more complicated affair including Nick's girlfriend Mike's desire for her.

Steve was considered weak and desperate because he married a women who already had a baby. Mike handled the horrors of war with logical thinking and stood strong the whole time. Steve was a complete mess during the war and Mike had to take care of him because Steve was mentally and physically unsuitable for war. Nick seemed to be strong like mike in the beginning of the war, but everything changed when he was forced to play Russian Roulette.

Stan was not self reliant and always needed the help of his friends, so things were hard for him during the war when he didn't have anyone to help him. Steve was weak to begin with which was shown when he married a girl who was pregnant with a child other than his own. Him losing his legs during the war did however seem to make him a bit more self-reliant, however he was a broken man.

882,6 December 2014,sadiesue219,8, Why does Mike go back to Vietnam to find Nick?,"In the first part of the movie, Mike and Nick are at Steve's wedding. They are both drunk and stumbling through the streets when Nick suddenly tells Mike not to leave him in Vietnam. This foreshadows the idea that Nick wont be leaving Vietnam. Throughout the first part of the movie, Mike is sort of the strong, responsible father figure to his group of friends, seen when he taught Stan a lesson in responsibility when he forgot his boots. It makes sense then that Nick trusts Mike to make sure he gets out of Vietnam, back to the home they both love.",
883,3 June 2005,bjj012,10, This movie rocks!,"I am not a fan of old movies, but when I saw the Deer Hunter, I cried so hard and it made me think about life. Plus, It also had one of my favorite characters starring. That character was none other then Christopher Walken who played Nick. I cried so hard when shot himself. I had never realized that Walken was so hot when he was younger. He still looks great and is still acting like a champ. I do recommend that those that haven't seen this movie, definitely need to see it. more then likely, you will find yourself to understand the movie's point and how much hard work was put in to make it incredible and an Oscar winning film.",
884,28 November 2014,travsturable,8, Deer Hunter,"1.) I believe the director was trying to make the Russian Roulette sequence a symbol of each of their lives and how it touches the sanity of those who play it. I liked how the director incorporated it into the movie. It shows just the difference the 3 friends became since that event. Ever since the Russian Roulette game in Vietnam, the three friends never looked at a gun the same way again. For example, when Stan had a loaded gun aimed at Axel for fun, Michael took it seriously and even played a roulette game on himself and Stan. It seemed as though he wanted to make himself clear that playing with a gun is not a game and can lead to serious consequences. Nick became psychologically disturbed after having been forced to cheat death with the game, and went on to cheat death multiple times afterwards. It seems as though he cracked and was no longer aware of what he was doing or anyone else around him. Life just became a game. 2.) I don't believe that their different approaches to life served as an accurate prelude as to what was going to happen. Anything could have happened in the War to anyone. It just so happens that Stevie ended up having both legs amputated while Nick ended up psychologically damaged. Michael was the only one to come out of this with the least amount of damage physically or mentally. I believe any of this could have happened to either one of the three. 3.) I believe that the French character represents the darkness. He basically leads Nick into more darkness. The scene where Michael sees Nick but Nick doesn't see him and goes off with the French guy is really emotional. Nick could have been saved by Michael at that exact moment, but instead goes off with the Devil himself as it was too late to stop them. I believe the French guy represents the evil that leads Nick to delve deeper into his out-of-state mind. 4.) Mike goes back to Vietnam to find Nick after he found hope that Nick might still be alive there. When Mike went to visit Stevie in the hospital, Steve notes that someone has been sending him money monthly from Saigon, at the time very dangerous. Mike concludes that it couldn't have been anyone else but Nick, and so he set forth to find him. Unfortunately, it ended in disaster as Russian roulette ended Nick's life in the hands of a grieving Mike.",
885,30 November 2014,peterpowers36,7, #4,"Mike went back to Vietnam in order to find Nick. He had feelings for Nick's girlfriend but he couldn't do anything with her because he broke a promise to his dear friend Nick. I think it also had to do with Nick being his best friend and knowing he didn't try to find Nick when he was still in Vietnam haunted him. Another theory could be that Mike knew he could not stay in the states until Nick was found, so he went back home to see if Nick beat him home, and to see if Steven made it home. With the knowledge that Nick wasn't back home he could knew he had to go back but he also had to find hint and clues on Nicks where about. In the long run it was clear that Mike was going to bring Nick home, dead or alive.",

887,1 December 2014,gmangoulet,7, Film Studies Review Assignment,"#3 The deal with the French character who introduces Nicky to the Russian Roulette den in Saigon is the directors way of showing Frances role in the Vietnam War. The story is based on the three Russian American friends who are steelworkers and go to Vietnam to fight on the behalf of the Americans in 1955. The movie then fast forwards to the three friends finding themselves in a POW camp and are being bet on to play Russian Roulette. When they are free from Vietnam they all don't keep in touch. It shows Nick walking on a street when a French guy comes up. He shows Nick the game of Russian Roulette which is hard for Nick to watch because he played Russian Roulette in the POW camp. The French character continues to talk to Nick about the game and the money that he could possibly win. At this point in the movie Nick is emotionally unstable because of the events that had happened in Vietnam. Mike had forced Nick to play the Russian Roulette game in Vietnam because if not they would have been tortured and killed so it was their only chance of survival. But here in Saigon they were playing for money. Later in the movie Mike goes back to find Nick and talks to the French guy. The French guy then says he doesn't know where Nick is and gives Mike his money back. This is showing how the French don't want to be part of the Vietnam War even though at the beginning of the war they were all for it an encouraging us. This is exactly how the French guy acts. The French guy ultimately ends up cooperating and shows Mike where Nick is, who is playing the Russian Roulette game. France's role in the Vietnam War was portrayed identically in the movie by the French character and his association with the Russian Roulette game.",
888,3 December 2014,LaneyH2015,7, Film Studies class assignment response,"#3: The French character and his interactions with the other characters represents and symbolizes France's role in the Vietnam war. America became involved with the war at the request of France, and the French-speaking man in turn invites Nick to the Russian roulette game. When it became clear to them that the war was neither a noble effort or something that they were likely to win, France distanced themselves from it and disregarded their ties to America. Likewise, when Nick's friend comes searching for him, the French man at first claims to know nothing about the situation and pretends that he can't even speak English.",
