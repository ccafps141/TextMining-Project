0,26 August 2010,hitchcockthelegend,9, For all I know you are the rat; and this might be the best heist homage movie ever?,"Reservoir Dogs is the debut of director and writer Quentin Tarantino. It stars Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker.",/
1,18 August 2000,Anonymous_Maxine,10," Quentin Tarantino begins his directing career with the first of several chronologically mixed, disturbingly violent, and incredibly powerful films.","Reservoir Dogs is a testament to the idea that ""less is more."" This doesn't apply to the violence, the film is extremely violent from beginning to end, but the details of the botched diamond heist, which the entire film is based on, are conveyed only in the dialogue, except for one scene where Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) recalls his escape. The whole film takes place after the failed robbery is over, and the mystery that unfolds among the criminal participants is amazing to watch. ",r
2,16 October 2022,Xstal,7, A Rainbow Coalition of Crooks...,"Mr Blonde has quite a nasty disposition, always eager to assist in a transition, from alive to being dead, he likes to cut and instil dread, a psychopathic, murdering, clinician. Mr Pink is quite uptight most all the time, as for tipping, wouldn't even leave a dime, continually he frets, he's quite feeble and quite wet, doesn't trust another soul when doing crime. Mr White can be quite tough but can be kind, not afraid to let you know what's on his mind, he can be the voice of reason, tries to add to the cohesion, though his finger's on the trigger and always primed.",e
3,9 May 2011,ElMaruecan82,10," These 'Dogs' bark a lot, but they bite, too ...","Bloodily violent, irreverently shocking, politically incorrect, inventively funny and so on and so forth I'm trying to find the right expression to describe ""Reservoir Dogs"" and I finally got it, it stands in three letters: N-E-W. There was something waiting in the abyssal wombs of cinema, so repressed it was waiting for deliverance with a fierce impatience, a deliverance with a quite original and cool-sounding name: Quentin Tarantino, the new incarnation of modern violence with STYLE. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is more than a debut; it's a sensational entrance that consecrated Tarantino among the most influential directors of his generation, and THE reference in independent film-making.",v
4,31 May 2006,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8, A stylish and excellent example of expert story-telling.,"After watching this half a dozen times with a biased, anti-Tarantino, ""what the heck is so great about this guy, anyway"" view(which, as most anyone watching any film with that view and a fair bit of self-knowledge will tell you, is a rather fruitless practice in pointlessness... if you've decided you're not going to like it, there's very little reason to think that you will, no matter how good it is; you need an open mind), I finally decided to give it a fair hearing... and I saw it for what it is. An unusual film, at least for its time. A stylish film full of cool dialog, cinematography, editing and music. The whole thing comes together perfectly and is very short of creating a sublime film experience. The plot is excellently written and told. The pace is perfect. I wasn't bored for a second, nor did I ever really want it to move faster or slower. The cinematography is magnificent, and incredibly well-integrated. Pans, dolly trips and, lest we forget, the stationary shots... all perfectly used. Very stylized. The acting is top-notch all-round. With most of the cast being name actors, this is no surprise, but they really do shine. Madsen, Buscemi, Keitel, Roth... all incredible. The one role that had less than good... well, let's be honest, it had rather awful acting. I'm speaking, of course, of Tarantino's character. Now, don't get me wrong; in From Dusk Till Dawn, this man did great. But just about any other time I've seen him act, he just doesn't seem to have the first clue. Being a film-maker myself(albeit on somewhat of a smaller scale than Quentin), I can relate to wanting to cast yourself in a role... but sometimes, you just need to face up to the facts, and admit it if you can't act. Still, that is a minor complaint. Another one might be that there are at least two fairly big characters that seem completely and entirely expendable... they had no real role in the action and could very, very easily have been cut with no real loss to the overall product. I won't name them here, but anyone who's seen the film will know who I'm talking about. All the characters, however, are well-written and their actions credible. Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to writing... something that also shows in the dialog, which, although somewhat drawn-out at times, is exceptional. Well-delivered, too. When it comes to direction, he shows how talented he is, as well. The film is very well put together. The editing is great, with the non-linear time-line telling the story far better than a ""regular"" film ever could. One of the many Tarantino-fans, in fact, the very person who originally talked me into watching this film, once told me that he had heard of someone editing films with such time-lines - this, Pulp Fiction, Memento, etc. - so that their time-lines were perfectly linear. I'm sorry, I entirely respect their right to do such a thing... and I won't claim that their doing so has less artistic value than the original films in any way... but I refuse to watch that. A big part of this being so well-told lies in the time-line. Also, I'm a firm believer of watching something the way the makers intended it. Don't edit, don't censor, don't make your own version and pass it off as anything but just that... your own version, and not the original. Sorry, rant over. Finally, I just need to comment on the music... the soundtrack of this is just great. Tarantino collected so many amazing 70's tunes for this film and used them great. All in all, just a really, really good film. Very little keeps this from being a perfect ten, most of which I've covered here. I recommend this to anyone who can stomach the violence and who likes their films with a side of style. 8/10",i
5,28 March 2010,planktonrules,9, Warning: This film is NOT for everyone...even though it is brilliant.,"It's hard to imagine that anyone has NOT heard that ""Reservoir Dogs"" is an ultra-violent film, but just in case you haven't, please understand that this is a super-duper ultra-violent film--and a film that many, many out there will find too difficult to watch or will traumatize you. I am not kidding...think twice before you decide to watch it and for heaven's sake, DON'T LET KIDS SEE THIS FILM.",e
6,3 January 2016,SnoopyStyle,8, Quentin Tarantino deconstructs the crime movie,A group of men are having benign banter in a diner. They have color code names. Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) brings a horribly wounded Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) back to the hideout. Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) is ranting about the quick police response as a setup. Joe Cabot hired the crew for a diamond store holdup keeping their identities secret from each other. Calm and disturbed Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) shows up with a captured cop.,w
7,15 July 2005,ronnay_barkay,10, A timeless classic...seriously,"The first time I saw Reservoir Dogs, I was about 15, it had been banned in my country, and I heard it was extremely voilent. Naturally I did everything in my power to get my paws on a copy, and when I finally did see it, I was disappointed. I was just sitting there saying ""Wheres all the violence"", Anyway, I watched it till the end, and then I watched it again, and since then it has just grew on me.",/
8,7 March 2004,Mr_Blonde3,10, Are you gonna bark all day.....,"A couple of weeks ago, I was blessed with a rare opportunity. one of the movie theaters in town did a midnight showing of this. Naturally, being a ""Dogs"" freak, I went down and saw it.",r
9,7 October 2005,SeminolePhenom,10, All of Tarantino's works are amazing and this is definitely no exception,"Four of six ruthless criminals await for their boss at an abandoned warehouse. After finding the diamond heist that they had all teamed up to accomplish was a trap, they realize that one of them is a police informant.",w
10,3 February 2007,moviewizguy,7, Very Overrated,"A gang of thieves carry out an armed robbery on a Diamond warehouse. The police are after them so quickly that they suspect they have a rat in their company. This film starts right after the robbery, with flashbacks to before the robbery, and to the planning of the crime.",3
11,3 January 2002,CharltonBoy,10, A BLOODY classic!,"Reservoir Dogs will always go down as one of the most violent yet brilliant pieces of work ever to be shown on the silver screen. Tarrentino's script is brilliant and what is even more amazing is that it is his first movie. The acting is top grade , all the actors seem to come up with the performance of lives. There were calls when the film was released for it to be banned by the lilly livered liberals and while this is bloody and the language is coarse, for it to be banned would have deprived us of a classic Hollywood movie that oozes class as well as blood! 10 out of 10",7
12,9 December 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10, A must see,"Definitely up there with Pulp Fiction as Tarantino's best. Reservoir Dogs is simply brilliant in all aspects. It is very brash, abrasive and unrelenting, but works tremendously with that sort of tone. The cinematography is very good I think, and the soundtrack is very appropriate and fitting. The story is wonderfully compelling, while the dialogue is very hard-boiled and attitude-laced with plenty of pop culture references, and references to TV shows and hip movies. Tarantino's direction is excellent, and so is the acting. Both Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth give performances that are among their best, while Michael Madson and Steve Buschemi are outstanding. Overall, I think it is a must. Maybe not for all, but I loved it and consider it one of Tarantino's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",8
13,14 August 2004,Theo Robertson,6, Don't Believe The Hype - It's Not That Good,RESERVOIR DOGS exploded onto cinema screens in 1992 and I can still remember the shock waves it caused due to the excessive violence . If memory serves me right Glasgow Council came very close to banning it from cinema chains in the city and they weren't alone in trying to do this either as newspaper headlines and word of mouth screamed how violent the movie was as Quentin Tarantino became the most infamous and influential movie director of the mid 1990s . RESERVOIR DOGS was finally allowed a British network TV transmission in the Summer of 1997 on channel 4 . I was rubbing my hands in anticipation at seeing this movie . After seeing the movie I felt disgusted . Not because it was a movie whose violent content had sickened me but because I'd fallen for the hype like a total shmuck . This must be the most overrated movie of the 1990s,3
14,17 December 2004,brandonennals,10, really a great movie!,"I watched this movie for the first time without knowing what the movie was about. I remember hearing about how cool this movie was and I saw people wearing shirts and listening to the soundtrack, but I had never seen it. So when it first came out on DVD, I bought it without ever watching it before. In Tarantino I trust. For good reason. This is a classic movie, a throwback. A movie about a jewel heist gone wrong and the consequences of working with strangers. This flick has a great cast, great script, and flawless direction. Taratino films are great because they stress the story more than anything else. In all of his movies, the script is strong enough to carry the movie. Now add good over the top acting and you have a hit. The realism of this movie is what grabs you. You really feel like you are in that abandoned warehouse. If felt privileged to have bought such a movie without watching it first. An instant classic. I love this movie!",0
15,16 March 2004,dr_foreman,2, I still don't get it,"People sure love this movie.  I have a friend who says that it's good because of the ear-slicing scene; most directors would cut away from such violence entirely, but here, we get to see the aftermath of a maiming.  Well yeah, ""Reservoir Dogs"" does push the envelope - but towards what?  Should we really praise a movie just because it wallows in violence more willingly than its predecessors?",5
16,28 January 2010,Hitchcoc,9, Pardon Me While I Bleed!,"I've been trying to see a lot of seminal films when possible. This is one that had me turning my head from time to time because of all the gore and disregard for human life. It starts with this great restaurant scene, Diner on steroids, where Steve Buscemi proves to be the selfish, cheap SOB that he plays throughout the film. I could watch this guy and his neurotic tics forever. I love films that put us at a point in time and then reconstruct the events leading up to it. Add to this, career criminals, some of whom are totally lacking in conscience. We have Harvey Keitel who is one of our greatest actors playing character with a little moral sense. He wants to find a little good. The characters all go by colors so they won't be able to identify each other if they are captured. Again, Buscemi gets into one of his gratuitous discussions when it is decided that he will be Mr. Pink. There is so much violence here, but the movie is at times funny and outrageous in a really insane way. Each guy is a powder keg and they maneuver for position. And, of course, there is ""the scene."" I really like the taut nature of this film, a mere 100 minutes. It moves neatly to its conclusion (well, perhaps, ""neatly"" isn't the best word), and things are tied up well in the end. Despite the huge amount of violence, I can see why people gravitate toward this film.",1
17,30 October 2016,Leofwine_draca,9, The epitome of style and coolness,"Quentin Tarantino's powerfully compelling heist movie is one that is both shockingly violence and compulsively funny. Suddenly appearing out of nowhere, this low-budget masterpiece caused an uproar in Britain with the moral guardians who were determined that the bloodshed should not be seen by weak-willed individuals living in this country. Thankfully they failed, which is why this video is now available in the UK in an uncut, uncensored film.",/
18,13 November 2020,mbhgkmsgg,8, Almost perfect,"As Tarantino as it gets. Reservoir Dogs is exactly what you'd expect from him. It's funny, it's gory, it's brutal and above all else, it's absolutely ridiculous. This movie could've been so incredible, but unfortunately, it slightly misses the mark.",?
19,13 August 2008,DarthVoorhees,10, Tarantino's debut is still his masterpiece,I have all ways liked Quentin Tarantino's work but I have to put an empathizes on the word 'liked' not loved. He certainly has changed the way movies are made and perceived but I have to disagree with a lot of people who consider him to be one of the greatest director's of all time. I don't want to anger his fans because they are plentiful and are all ways very passionate about their hero but I think Reservoir Dogs is actually superior to the much more loved Pulp Fiction.,r

21,17 July 2002,mrmoustache0420,10, A Neo-Violent Joy,"This is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen and definately deserves its position on the Top 250. It's an acquired taste, but if you've been desensitised to violence (as i have), then you will want to watch this again from the minute it ends. Every single actor was perfectly fitted for its character. Steve Buscemi as the squirrely Mr. Pink, Harvey Keitel as the veteran Mr. White, and of course, Michael Madsen as the phsycotic Mr. Blonde. The list goes on and on.",f
22,24 November 2022,VikingBurialService,7," Not bad, but not Tarantino's Best","Not my favorite Tarantino movie, but not bad for a first feature film. Basically, a bunch of criminals meet up after a heist gone wrong, and try to figure out which one of them is the rat. The movie has a lot of the usual tarantino tropes; lots of blood, lots of vulgarity, lots of violence. There's also a lot of fun dialogue scenes when all the main characters are bantering together. Unfortunately, I think a lot of the one-on-one dialogue between characters feels slightly stiff and expositional. On top of that, the plot's not very enjoyable. Even the likeable and redeemable characters die in the end. There is some catharsis from seeing the evil characters get shot, but it doesn't (for me) balance out the tragic ending. Overall not a terrible movie, but doesn't measure up to the director's later work.",_
23,10 October 2008,kurciasbezdalas,10, A simple story told in original way,"What is good about this movie? Probably the same things what makes other Tarantino's movies good: great soundtrack, good actors, stylish direction and of course - violence (actauly there was only one scene which I would call really violent). The plot is pretty simple but it's portrayed out of chronological order (just like in Pulp Fiction). Probably that is what makes this movie different. Also everything in a movie looked pretty realistic (like violence) and all characters acted very natural (there were many memorable dialogs, so you could know each character better). This movie is very original, stylish and worth your time.",=
24,27 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,8," Reservoir Dogs is loud, bloody and constantly in your face.","In terms of directorial debuts, this is a solid entry that assured Tarantino as one of the best directors working today. Now, as most of you know, I'm not a big fan of Tarantino. Just not my cup of tea so to speak. Yet this was a good crime thriller. After a heist goes terribly wrong, the group of professional robbers make haste and convene at a remote warehouse. During this time, they try to find out who snitched on them to the police. In glorious (see what I did there...) Tarantino fashion, there is a bucket full of blood and a script full of profanity that infuses rather well with the story. Fortunately the narrative is not linear, so we're flipping back and forth between character introductions and the aftermath of the heist, to keep the plot's pace rapid and fresh. The characters themselves may not be completely memorable, but their names are. Mr White, Mr Brown, Mr Blonde, Mr Orange, Mr Pink and so on. With one humorous scene involving a small argument about the particular choice of ""Mr Pink"" (who was played excellently by Steve Buscemi). It's a story that is dialogue driven, like most of his films, so the wit and dark humour is conveyed through sharp exaggerative banter between these characters. It works, stupendously well actually. Harvey Keitel was the most enjoyable to watch, and finally we have a film with Tim Roth that I actually like. Hooray! Quentin himself should not act in his films. Why? Because he is abysmal. Makes me cringe every time I see him. The torture scene is filled with gore and is probably the most engaging scene in the film. Don't get me wrong, it's a compelling script. But I find the execution extremely, how to put this, noisy. I like subtlety. Sometimes less is more which is why I'm not his biggest fan. Atleast it's not 3 hours long, my brain would've been numbed if that were the case. However in saying that, I find this to be one of his better films (behind Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained) with a punchy script filled with plenty of violence. A damn good directorial debut.",t
25,13 September 2006,Flagrant-Baronessa,8," Edgy, engrossing and still holds up well as a heist film over the years","""I feel like a director who has not yet directed, therefore I don't exist."" Said an idealist, enthusiastic Quentin Tarantino back when he was working at Video Archives in the early 1990s, eager to start climbing the directorial ladder in Hollywood. At this time he was just a screenplay-writer, penning early works such as Natural Born Killers (a baby of his he felt he stabbed in the heart when he gave up to Oliver Stone to rewrite), True Romance and From Dusk Till Dawnall initially fruitless fares that no one dared to green-light. Production companies were choosy, cliquish and wouldn't give an untested director like Tarantino a break. Not even for Reservoir Dogs.",t
26,19 July 2007,FilmCriticLalitRao,1, Violence for violence's sake might set a bad precedent,"Everybody knows that criminals are big losers but still there is a strong tradition in American cinema especially in Hollywood of making films which glorify criminals.Everybody knows that Godfather,a film about a mafia family is hailed as a classic film.People know well as to what kind of things mafia do and how harmful they are to human society in general.Reservoir Dogs is one such dumb film which through its antics champions the cause of crooks without morals.Tarantino is believed to be a humorist however his humor is undoubtedly bland and mainly consists of filthy abuses.A word about the violence in the film: by showing macabre scenes of senseless violence Tarantino has shown that in the name of creative freedom and in order to gain easy publicity all rules can be broken and more the violence the more controversial the film is going to be.Good that this film has not been emulated by other film makers. It is a good development that till now no studio has come forward with the idea of making a sequel of this film.God save America who has Quentino.",_

29,30 August 2004,Mr_Vai,1, One of the most inane and dated movies of our time,"I remember watching this movie when it first came out and I did not know what to think. I mean, it was different. I could not remember seeing dialog like this before or a scene where a guy cuts another guy's ear off. It was unique in that regard. Mind you, it was different, but not really special. Moreover, some parts were very boring. Other parts were so ""talky"" and somewhat over the top, that they strained credibility. However, there were some funny lines as well. After having watched this again, some ten years later, I can say with all honesty, this film has not aged well. On second look, you see what looks like a first year film student project. It still has funny lines, but the story is paper thin. The actors tend to over act and the dialog is so full of Clint Eastwood wannabe one-liners, that you just roll your eyes. Michael Madsen cannot act, sorry. He is cool, but he cannot act. Tim Roth's attempt at an American accent makes him sound like Ralph Cramden from the HoneyMooners. I was just amazed at how bad this film really looked to a more mature person. The funny lines just don't cover that constant posturing of characters that have no real depth. The movie is cotton candy, it looks filling, but is far from it. Perhaps there will always be 14 year old boys around to give this ""cool film"" high marks, but I fear it will grow more ridiculous the older I get. However, Tarantino has this cult of personality going and I am sure the 10s will continue coming in for this film and a 10 might mean perfect in here, but that don't make it so.",v
30,10 June 2018,gabriel_sanchez,10, Tarantino's touch was born here!,Reservoir Dogs (1992) is a slow paced story-driven flick about a heist gone wrong.,
31,9 March 2005,mbuchwal,1, A tasteless exercise in violence.,"When critics say that some films are pornographic because of the way they depict violence, they are referring to the type of violence that appears in ""Reservoir Dogs."" The film maker's artistic judgment seems to be clouded by a bloodthirsty hatred of police officers. I am thinking particularly of a scene in which a captive police officer is mutilated by his criminal captors. The feeling conveyed to me was one of sadistic joy in the victim's suffering, a sense that he deserved to be mutilated simply because he was a cop. I am sure that some misguided admirers of this film applauded the scene precisely for that reason. Unfortunately, a lot of people hate the police, and for them such a film functions as escapist ""entertainment,"" but ""Reservoir Dogs"" seems to lack any redeeming value of another kind, like a snuff movie.

33,23 July 2003,Quinoa1984,10," Practically tailor-made for a film buff (as well as for a viewer who watches occasionally), 'Dogs' is a picture loaded to the brim with terrific visceral energy","Whenever the name Quentin Tarantino is mentioned nowadays, people treat him with the same reverence as Scorsese, De Palma, and other directors as such who have fiddled around with the crime/gangster genre to create personal, heavy-duty masterworks.  However, at the time this film was first released, as was with his still best picture 'Pulp', he was regarded as a filmmaker who makes violent movies, filled with violence, chock full of violence, ""too violent"" (if there ever could or should be such a thing in movies), etc. This is unfair.  True, Tarantino writes and works his actors to such an intensity that the feelings that go with violent acts and violent tension is there, and true he shows the blood, he lets us hear the cries of agony and despair, and indeed there are times that bullets fired into people are shown as such right in frame.

41,7 January 2001,notthepromqueen,10, not just your average after-dinner movie...,"...this is the whole damn meal. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is about a crime gone horridly awry, and it makes no apologies for its violence, slurs, and language.  It doesn't have to, because of its brilliant, gripping script and plot twists, acting that makes you think these people are real, and a flashy presentation of it all. Quentin Tarantino came on the scene not with a whimper but a bang with this story of a diamond heist which is foiled by an undercover cop--one of the criminals.   The story unfolds backwards, beginning with Quentin Tarantino waxing poetic on Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"", and manages to cover Tim Roth writhing around in Harvey Keitel's backseat with a bullet in his stomach, Michael Madsen with a straight razor and a bound & gagged cop, Chris Penn crying rape in his father Laurence Tierney's office, and other insane, violent, and/or hilarious plot lines leading to a dazzling end.

The first time I'd seen Reservoir Dogs was after a wave of Tarantino enthusiasm having watched and loved Pulp Fiction, a film released two years after this little masterpiece.

49,13 October 2022,Horst_In_Translation,8," Crime hounds, prime hounds","""Reservoir Dogs"" is an American live action film from 1992 and if you do the mathematics, then this means that this one has its 30th anniversary now in 2022 and this is also the reason why this movie returned to many film theaters here in Germany for a week or more. I am really glad it did. This was not the first time I watched this one (not even close), but the first time I got to watch it on the big screen and I enjoyed it so much that I even thought about seeing it a second time as long as it is still on here. It's not a long movie as it stays under the 100-minute mark and that already includes the closing credits, but it can be called a classic. The film is not only in the imdb top250, but in the imdb top100 at this point and will probably stay there for a little while also. It was rated by more than a million people on the world's biggest film website. Enough said. The writer and director is of course Quentin Tarantino. He will turn 60 in 2023, and this could be another nice occasion to show or at least watch this film. Which means that he was not even 30 when he came up with this one. It was Tarantino's second full feature film, but the first one barely counts as it was from five years earlier and almost nobody has really seen it by now. This is also why you have to give props to the cast members here who agreed to star in the film of a man who was pretty much a nobody in the early 1990s, but they read the script and story and gave it/him a chance and the reward could not be any bigger really. Well, he was not so much a nobody anymore after this film or especially in the mid1990s when he won the Oscar for writing Pulp Fiction. There he worked on the screenplay with Roger Avary and Tarantino and Avary, even younger than Q, also collaborated already here on ""Reservoir Dogs"". Their paths separated afterwards, but that is okay and many consider this the greatest stage of Tarantino's career, even if I am not sure if I would agree. His movies with Christoph Waltz were utterly creative too and same applies to the Kill Bill years of course.",

What is relevant makes no use of the medium.  Characters are not introduced through telling actions, but by introducing themselves in some kind of criminal job-interview. Tarantino's 'genius' seems to be a habit of having the lowest sort of people engaged in violent pursuits converse as casually as ladies at tea.  It's a trick he uses and re-uses in all his films.

66,15 November 2017,sol-,7, Dogfight,"Suspicion and paranoia overwhelm a band of criminals after a tightly plotted heist goes sour in this feature film debut from Quentin Tarantino. The film is built on an interesting dynamic with none of the robbers actually knowing one another since they were all hired by a third party, given code names and were told to not tell each other their true identity. How much can they really trust each other's word and could one of them be a police informant? Intriguing as all this might sound, one's mileage with the movie is almost certain to vary depending on one's tolerance of the dialogue-heavy script. While some of the violence is quite brutal, there is precious little of it as the film mostly consists of the characters bantering back and forth, which unfortunately has a tendency to feel repetitive. The imbalanced time spent on each criminal's background feels a little odd too with some of them far more developed than others. All that said and done, the revelation of the police informant's identity is very well done and the second half of the film has many intense moments. The final few scenes are especially memorable with an outcome that resonates in the mind long after the film is over.",

Anyone seeing it for the first time is in for a real treat. The story is of an experienced gangster who attempts to create the perfect crime. Its simple enough, collect seven of the most professional and trustworthy men in the business, assign them code names, tell them just enough about the crime to do their part, snatch the haul, then rendezvous in a warehouse after the job and split the take. The men selected are top of the line actors like Lawrence Tierney as the Boss Joe Cabot, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and Chris Penn. Like the best laid plans, the unexpected was not included and therefor becomes the focus of a violent shouting match with guns. Between themselves, the heist should have worked, why it didn't has much to do with the body in the trunk (Kirk Baltz) and will have them at each other's throats trying to fathom the reason. The final segment of the film makes it the most exciting climax since the shootout of the Wild Bunch.

76,9 November 2007,dataconflossmoor,10, Anything For Attention!!!,"When viewing information about different movies, and their respective reviews on this website, officials posted that this movie was likened to the film ""Diner"". At first, I found this to be a very peculiar comparison!! The minute I popped this movie into the DVD player, I realized the similarity to both movies, particularly with regards to the introductory dialog... I like this type of opening scene, the gist of it being whereby the incongruity of conversation effectively depicts the twisted character portrayals of the pivotal actors in the film !! The camera angles to the coffee shop pontifications, as illustrated in ""Diner"" and in ""Resevoir Dogs"", were extremely poignant!! As was the case with ""Diner"", ""Resevoir Dogs"" depicted an overtly energetic camaraderie with everyone conversing at the coffee shop table. The film, ""Diner"" provided a succinct illustration of kindred spirits which were precocious, with ""Resevoir Dogs"" the bonds were rather macabre!! Focusing now on ""Resevoir Dogs"", that guy who was adamant about not tipping the waitress struck an intensely sensitive nerve cord with me, as I used to be in the food and beverage industry. How did I feel about that guy? Put it this way, if he thinks his manner of killing someone is gruesome and sickening, once a bunch of bartenders get a hold of him, he ain't seen nothing yet... While I detest the term ""ain't"" as it is a colloquialism for the illiterate, it is seemingly appropriate in this case!! Speaking of colloquialisms, this movie was full of them. The F word was habitually used in the film ""Resevoir Dogs"", in fact it was the movie's favorite colloquialism!! The F word is basically an interjection, however, the usage of the F word demonstrates an amazing versatility which accommodates virtually every part of speech, it is very amenable when used a as a gerund as well!! Such an excessive use of this word in ""Resevoir Dogs"" bares a precarious resemblance to the movie ""The Departed""... My G-Rated euphemisms are not displayed here because I am so delicate, rather, it is because I am aware of IMDb's comment guidelines!! This film was about a bunch of reprobates who were amused by their irrational conclusions, and delving into a complacently convoluted logic became their favorite hobby!! Why were all of the characters in this movie so thwarted? Come on!! I have to be at another appointment in about a half an hour!! When someone talks about seriously engaging in a first class felony, they get attention, once they totter with the idea of murder, people are all ears, at least they should be!! Such lamentations evoke a very lethal excoriation against the ""establishment"". Quentin Tarrantino directs this film, and, he is without a doubt, an unprecedented cannon of creativity!! His overall motif of blood and violence is his notoriously successful trademark, ""Pulp Fiction"" being his prize piece!! While compared to the movie ""Diner"" I may be one of the few who likes ""Diner"" better, of course, I am civilized!! Nevertheless, ""Resevoir Dogs"" is a remarkably well made movie which tries to use the recreation of murder as the ultimate and prevailing diatribe of circumstantial justification!! It (""Resevoir Dogs"") has an innovative approach to larceny, and a criminal's code of ethics!! You watch ""Resevoir Dogs"", I will guarantee you that you will not be bored!! The acting, the directing, and the aggregate creation of this film, falls into the category of sensational entertainment... I give this film a perfect ten!! See it when you're angry!!",

And the secrets of the plot are slowly told but once they are revealed its still has interresting. Each character have some very special aspects about them, and its probably the movie with the most different interresting characters.

83,21 February 2013,aciessi,10, Defines Tarantino as a Filmmaker,"Reservoir Dogs was Quentin Tarantino's first motion picture. But even as early as his first try, you can see every element that defines Tarantino as the unmatched filmmaking legend that he is revered as. It just might be the greatest indie film of all time. No budget, no SFX, no big sets and no wide distribution. But the amount of emotion, humor, sadism and reality that this film conveys is more extraordinary than any big name blockbuster. The plot of the film is brief, but it works. It's about a well organized heist that goes terribly wrong. Truth is, there is a rat in the whole operation, but who? With that in place, Tarantino takes us beyond what is said on paper and retraces the steps it took these men to get to the predicament they are in now. We see the back stories of Mr. White, Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange, all without ever meaning to place them in the middle of the conflict. Its a movie that only the viewer can interpret, and the important facts are placed at the forefront to help come to a conclusion. This information works in favor of the main narrative. Some have complained about not hearing the origins of Mr. Pink, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue, Nice Guy Eddie and Joe Cabot. I agree. Perhaps more clarification of their purposes might have enhanced the narrative. Perhaps it would have answered the obvious question, What was the point of this whole operation? I'm sure Quentin would have made the film twice as long and incorporated all of their stories had he made the film today. Needless to say, It does not take away from the experience. In fact, the mysteriousness makes it even more entertaining. Also, Reservoir Dogs will always fall under the controversy of being too violent for mainstream audiences, as well as being highly unnecessary. Well, I disagree. Violence is the name of the game in the life of being a Dog. If that means chopping off an ear while dancing to K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies, then why not? Reservoir Dogs doesn't exist to share a moral. Rather, it shows to us just how something so right can go so wrong. Even if the right was wrong in the first place. Reservoir Dogs is the precursor to the rest of Tarantino's career, and to get started watching the long journey of his success, make sure you pop in this amazing flick first.",

And on this logic alone I rented Reservoir Dogs for the first time in 1993.  I had heard of a new man on the scene that apparently was the talk of Hollywood.  I had also heard that there were some pretty interesting actors in the film and I had heard that Harvey Keitel was the one responsible for getting the film started.  So I was intrigued to see what the fuss was over this film.  However, the first time I saw it I was rather impartial to it.  It's not that I didn't like it but I just thought it to be okay.  I didn't really get what all the fuss was about but I did have a hard time watching the torture scene.  So I put Reservoir Dogs away in my mind until Pulp Fiction came out.

So what you get is an hour and change of vogue action with several very talented actors trying to outcool each other with acts of violence. It doesnt work; and is just an exercise in gangster wannabe behavior without the substance of real gangster behavior. Everyone is having a good time making believe they are hard guys, but in real life, not one of these characters would be allowed to pull off a job for any decent gang in the country; especially a caper that requires great planning and execution like this one. The plot is interesting, but the direction and cinematography is so sloppy, that it ruins any chance for the film to be successful.

109,3 July 2004,JoeKarlosi,6, Reservoir Dogs (1992) **1/2,"This is Quentin Tarantino's first movie -- a really down and dirty, realistic affair about gangsters and what can occur when they screw up a jewel heist. It starts out great (I liked those early diner discussions about tipping and the point behind Madonna's ""Like A Virgin""), and the torture sequence featuring Michael Madsen is disturbing and very effective. But there isn't much of a plot to all of the goings on, and the bulk of this picture consists of a lot of aimless cursing and yelling. I tend to think of the excellent PULP FICTION when discussing Quentin's other movies, as that was the first of his films I'd seen, and I fell in love with it...a real work of art, that movie. So after going back and discovering DOGS, it becomes apparent that Tarantino rehashed some of this for FICTION. Maybe ""fine tuned"" a few things. This is evident with moments like the aforementioned discussion and philosophies in the diner. And Tarantino's obviously fond of working with the same actors again and again.",
110,3 March 2007,classicsoncall,9," ""Alright ramblers, let's get ramblin'.""","""Reservoir Dogs"" is a blast and a half. Quentin Tarantino's non linear method of telling a story keeps one viscerally engaged, almost as if you were really there like a fly on the wall with a direct view of the proceedings. It's a style that works without being confusing, even if you have some misgivings about following the story; and even if you do, a second viewing clears that up completely. Nor is Tarantino concerned about disposing of characters off screen, as he did with Brown (Tarantino himself) and Blue (Eddie Bunker). The technique tends to put even more focus on the surviving characters attempting to come to grips with their situation. As far as that goes, don't even concern yourself with following the Colors, it doesn't make much difference who's Brown, Blue, or Blonde, the players are so fully convincing you'll get wrapped up in their narratives as each contributes to the total package. Then as the pot simmers and comes to a boil, the result is a new kind of gangster film that Bogart and Cagney couldn't even imagine.",

The performances (especially by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen, who plays a convincing psychopath) we're incredible.

A movie as RD with (just) a strong focus on violence is not enough for me to give it a high rating. Of course the acting and directing was very good, but I was missing a real strong script. And thats why I could not enjoy this movie and was just very disappointed because my expectations were very high (also based on the high rating on IMDB).

For one, the cast that this movie has is enough to inspire serious jealousy. Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Laurence Tierney, Eddie Bunker, Chris Penn... hot damn! You really see just why everyone wanted to make a film just like this one after it was released. It's funny but the film is so derivative of other crime films that it becomes an entirely new animal. Tarantino delivers a film that is completely sure of itself and what it wants to be. Yeah, some people complain that it's a ripoff of other films that preceded it, namely Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire"" but still, the film has so many memorable moments and gobs of instantly quotable dialogue that it is undoubtedly a classic of independent cinema. Tarantino's acting in this film is thankfully subdued. Violence comes in sudden jolts and reminds you of what kind of people it is you are dealing with within the film. The music selection is inspired and he does a great job of establishing these characters through their words and actions, which is why this film is so great. You have to love the characters, even in the case of Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) who gets much less screen time than anyone else in the film.",

The movie starts off with some lighthearted comedy and then transitions into more serious events. It is a good way to engage and hook the audiences, but unfortunately, this hook only lasts so long. The twist is easy to predict, and the movie is extremely dull. I felt none of the characters were extremely fleshed out, so there is not really any reason to attach to any of them. The ending was decent, but left me feeling a little disappointed. With already mostly unlikeable and boring characters being the center of the movie, an ending like this doesn't work.

I loved Pulp Fiction in so many ways but most of which came from the last 15 minutes of the film in which we understand Samuel L. Jackson's journey in the film. It is that quality that is missing in Reservoir Dogs that, in my opinion, is the film's failing. The film is nothing but graphic pain and violence. There is nothing to endear any of the characters to us (unless you are endeared to people that like to mutilate people to hip 70's tunes). The characters have no real journey. The dialog is inventive (as we expect from Tarantino) but the plot is not. It's about violence for the sake of shocking the audience. It's disturbing in the ways that a horror film is disturbing without the payoff in the end. The film is extremely popular and that disturbs me more than the film itself.",

128,5 August 2017,hishlea-ludea,6, Decent film,"From the opening moments of ""Reservoir Dogs"" you sense that you are watching a different kind of crime drama. The style and dialog of this picture bestows a level of intelligence upon it's characters that defies the reality of their chosen profession. Having said that,this movie is absolutely riveting in it's movements from the ordinary, to the grim, to the horrific aspects of a career criminal. Quintin Tarantino has written a tale of an almost corporate order to constructing a crime gang. The delight is in meeting these characters one by one. The particular crime is no more crucial to the film than a 7-11 stick-up. The crux of the movie is the portrayal of the rainbow of characters who find themselves involved in a life of crime. Much has been made of the violence in the movie, but it only serves to point out that all men are different......even the crooked. The director has included a number of very memorable scenes. This is not a linear film. The movie works more as a series of set pieces that weave together a story that is not as important as the individual parts that you have the pleasure of observing. This movie may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate.",
129,31 January 2011,gigan-92,10, My Favorite Tarantino Production???,"There are so many perspectives on which to praise ""Reservoir Dogs"". First and foremost, it has the edgy realism that began to slip away in the ""Kill Bill"" films (which I still very much praise and enjoy), and was completely discarded in his recent film ""Inglourious Basterds"". It's like recently Tarantino let his fame go to his head and just went all out without thinking about if what he showed on screen made any real sense. This film of his, basically his first three, are the ones I admire the most. Not to mention the way the story is told, it's just very intriguing from the start. We see only brief glimpses of what actually happened at this bank job that apparently went very, very, bad. The cast was phenomenal throughout and this film had the chemistry to really make the tension play out realistically and brutally later on. The atmosphere is solid and full of well acted malice and is pretty unpredictable. In fact, amidst all the insane and gruesome scenes which some may struggle to sit through (""Can you hear me now?"")is a very nicely paced plot that in reality is probably one of the greatest crime/thriller pieces ever written.",

Ever since, 'Reservoir Dogs' has remained one of my all-time favourites - it's an absolutely fantastic piece of film-making, complete with stylish camera-work, a brilliant soundtrack (I just salivate over the opening credits sequence with 'Little Green Bag' playing) and stellar characterisation.

It was this unique style that captured me from the first minute I experienced it. The way characters were introduced and scenes were arranged was so different to everything I had seen at this point and the dialogues had such impact without being over acted. But not only the spoken word stands out in this movie also the pictures you see on the screen have a whole lot of impact. The way the camera is used has something I can't really explain but it makes every frame of this movie look like a cool poster in my opinion (something Tarantino kept up to this day imo).
Also the story is a hell of a ride and the order which the story is told in is just pure genius and could not be done any better in my opinion.

Though not really my cup of tea, the movie is much like the playhouse theater movies of the 1950s and early 60s with emphasis on dialogue and noir violence rather than taking you somewhere. Obviously low budget but that goes with the genre. The cop bashing seemed over the top to the point of pandering and I doubt any cop these days would sacrifice himself to bust some garden variety mobsters. The three way shooting scene at the end also seemed a bit hard to believe given that the the subject of the argument, an informant cop who took a bullet to the gut was about to die anyway. These issues notwithstanding, what was really missing from the movie was one more big ticket star. The trivia says Tarantino tried several times to get James Woods for the movie but his agent didn't pass on the offer to Woods given that it was below what he normally gets for a movie. That is too bad, because Woods wood have been perfect in this movie, say as the wounded police informant.

155,17 March 2005,jboothmillard,10, Reservoir Dogs,"This debut from cult director Quentin Tarantino was very well received, and he was even nominated the Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize Dramatic. The story may be mixed up with the continuing warehouse scene, and flashbacks of each individual group member, but you can give it a chronological order. Basically crime boss Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) hires six criminals, strangers to each other, gives them false names so they don't get attached to each other and concentrate on job the diamond robbery. They are sure it will go without a hitch, but the police show up and the group members panic, shooting them and some civilians. The police did manage to kill two of them, the others are all getting together, slowly, in the rendezvous point (the warehouse), and begin to suspect that the one member shot, slowly dying, is an undercover cop. Starring Harvey Keitel as Mr. White/Larry Dimmick, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange/Freddy Newandyke, Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde/Vic Vega, Chris Penn as Nice Guy Eddie Cabot, Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink, Edward Bunker as Mr. Blue and Tarantino as Mr. Brown. The film only had a $1.5m budget, and it took only five weeks to shoot, and it grossed millions worldwide, cool! It was number 64 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, for the infamous ear cutting scene with the song ""Stuck In The Middle"" playing (juxtaposition). The other great song of the film is ""Little Green Bag"" when introducing the actors and opening credits. Harvey Keitel was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Outstanding!",

It's quite something and I love it. It's the one where the legendary Diamond heist takes place and all the iconic colorful characters are introduced like Mr.Blonde,Mr. Orange. It's filled with iconic scenes,characters and their interactions between each other, music in the right places to enhance the expierience of whatever happens perfectly and you can never forget the K-Billy's super sounds of the 70s playing in the background in important moments.

Then as a team they set off to rob a jewelry store? The robbery goes bad and what ensues is a bloodbath as the police and the robbers face off with each other. This is not a good movie. I love all the actors but I don't think this movie is well written or directed. If you're going to make a movie about gangsters one should do more research then Mr. Tarantino did. He stayed home for a few years watching old cowboy movies and came up with this garbage. I love Pulp Fiction but this film is so horribly conceived its impossible to take seriously.

163,13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,7," Interesting Premise, Solid Outing","We should have known there was something about this guy from Tennesse named Quentin Tarantino when we saw his first solo effort, Reservoir Dogs. While not as total an effort as his later movies, Reservoir Dogs does have some revolutionary value to it. Written mostly by Taratino, Reservoir Dogs is a crime movie where the crime failed. A group of 6 anonymous men, each with a different code name, come together under crime boss Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) to steal a diamond shipment from a Los Angeles diamond store. The first scene gives us a sense of who these men are and what makes them tick as they are finishing up their breakfast before the heist. The next thing we see is afterward, 2 of the men are dead and the other 4 are trying to figure out what happened. There is the usual Tarantino dialog, featuring lots of cursing, lots of pop-culture, but also unexpected humor, and also boasts Tarantino musical selections that fit the scenes well, most people think of Reservoir Dogs now when hearing the song ""Stuck In the Middle With You."" The film overall is good, Tarantion takes the crime caper movie and spins it around, what would it be like if a movie heist actually failed, but that is about as far as it goes. There is a lot of talking, I had wished a little more actually happened, and the ending is just that, an ending, nothing more. There's lots of blood and people shooting at each other, and is interesting. Tarantino would prove later that he is capable of completing what he started, just not quite with Reservoir Dogs.",

Quentin Tarantino is one of the most brilliant minded directors in the history of film-making who came out of a video store to making one of most popular crime film. Reservoir Dogs is capable of having small time actors (with the exception of Harvey Keitel) and making them put up fantastic and mind-blowing performances. This is what a great script can do to actors. The dialogue is so amazing, the music is incredible especially the song, ""Little Green Bag"" in the beginning of the film, and of course the acting is sensational.

For the first 30 minutes, I was just hoping the trademark Tarentino ""dialogue"" would end!!! I know Tarentino is very good at dialogue, but sometimes he overdoes it (also in ""Grindhouse: Death Proof"") and he definitely does so in this movie. The plot is intricate, the acting is well done, but the plot is at a full stop due to the endless drone of talk talk talk that I really don't care about. The ending was surprising and did save the movie from a lower score, but I guess I will never understand why people think this is one of Tarentino's best movies and one of the better movies of all time.",

181,12 May 2008,bobsgrock,8, A very strong debut.,"Quentin Tarantino never ceases to amaze and stun with his films, and this is never more true than in his debut as writer/director of this American crime classic about seven men attempting to pull off the perfect jewel caper, but something goes terribly wrong. They suspect there is a rat informer among them, but who? What makes Reservoir Dogs so memorable is that it is so unlike any other crime drama, yet it fits that genre so well. It is violent, but only in a few scenes and the most horrific occurs off-screen. This film is unique because it tells the story backwards and gives us a better picture of the seven men and their interactions rather than the event that is the holdup. AS expected, the dialogue is the best part of the film and some of the best you will ever hear. The acting is very good as well, especially Michael Madsen as the calm, quiet, psychopathic Mr. Blonde, and Lawrence Tiereny as the head man Joe Cabbot. Really, if you are at all interested in film, this is a must see. Not only is it an American crime classic, it is an influential piece of work that set the stage for one of the best directors of the modern era and his masterpiece: Quentin Tarantino and Pulp Fiction.",

I had forgotten the plot itself and I am so glad I did. There were a few times that I was probably just as stunned by twists and actions as I was the first time. This low budget film about a planned jewelry heist by a first time director is some sort of masterpiece of violence, machismo and mayhem. That it wasn't even a hit when released is amazing. The direction is brilliant and the performances are all outstanding particularly Tim Roth, though again, the six principle actors are all wonderful. We all know about that first time director now. It's hard to tell what is Quentin Tarantino's best film, but this is in the equation. This is essentially a simple plot and he would go on to make much more complex and intricate films, but the roots of every Tarantino is here. This is short, tight, immensely effective with an awesome usage of songs, but that has become commonplace in his films by now. Time has not made this any less potent.

187,3 September 2007,Robert_duder,9, How wrong I was about Tarantino and how brilliant this film is,"I think I've started every Tarantino review I've done so far with this same statement.

I thought he tried too hard to be original and different and used gratuitous nudity, violence, language just for the sake of doing it and then I accidentally got sucked in by Kill Bill and I have been more of a convert every day. So finally I sat down to watch the classic that is Reservoir Dogs which I think might be one of the smartest and most stylish films in Hollywood. The entire film is based on a huge heist that you never see, with some characters you hardly get to know, with a deep history that you never really get the full background of, and a setting that is 98% in an empty warehouse room and yet is incredibly brilliant. The script is so sharp and intelligent and although CHOCK full of horrendous four letter words but you get in the jive with who these guys are and what's happening and who is who and it just sucks you in. So much of the film relies so heavily on the dialog and it's just riveting in the way it is presented. The actors in this film are kind of a who's who of brilliant character actors who have done piles of films and this is kind of their piece de resistance because they give their all and should have received academy award nominations. Some of them give their best performances I have ever seen.",

This low profile character based, dialogue driven film is masterful. The facts surround a group of thieves getting together for a big score, which goes horribly wrong. Add in the element of a police informant and you have the basis for Reservoir Dogs. While the film has some graphic and shocking moments, it is the elements of character conversation that deeply resonates with the viewer. Through the characters we get a look into the mind of Quentin Tarantino. The film also establishes several elements that will continue in future films, such as Pulp Fiction. In addition to character connections, we see a great attention to details, and the use of a monster soundtrack as an additional character in the tale.

I watched it waiting for the action and waiting for them to show us the robbery. How can this be called a gangster movie if they don't even show you a robbery? It said everywhere that this movie is a classic. What's classic about it? Robbers who cuss and act childish all the time waffling on about a robbery? All they do is talk and swear for 94 minutes, that's all they do. And it was very predictable who the cop was. There was no surprise. The reason I knew it was Mr. Orange was because Mr. White was treating him like a little 5 year old and he still treated the others like they were a piece of garbage. The direction was poor. The pacing was off. The humor with them discussing body functions and people's religion, etc was way off. They tried too hard to be funny when it came to he humor. There are 2 great songs in this movie, but that's it. The only thing that's original about this movie is the color names. The movie just seemed pointless, especially after the ending. They all shoot each other. What was the point in that? Them waffling on about a robbery, then nd up killing each other? What sense is that? I guess people love Quentin Tarintino so much that they'll accept anything he gives you. The dialog wasn't even good. Gangsters talking about their life and trying to be humorous, BORING! ",

It tells the terribly unpleasant story of a few chatty thugs, with color-coded names, who assemble in an abandoned warehouse after a jewel heist goes terribly wrong. Loud arguments, gun-fights, and a nasty little torture scene ensue. Still, Tarantino had a few good ideas, and I'll give him that. Narrative through flashback was done with a clever flair and I did like the way Tarantino chose to have all his characters lacking morals (even the ""blue rat""), so we wouldn't be forced to sympathize with any one of them. That's all that ""Reservoir Dogs"" really is though, a few good ideas but a genuinely unpleasant moviegoing experience. Rated R. 99 minutes. 4 out of 10.",

What ""follows"" is the aftermath of it all as they reflect how they got there and what they are going to do now. I put the ""follows"" in quotes, because the robbery is the inciting incident to the main story, but interestingly this film has plenty of back story that develops as we see how each of the robbers wound up pulling the job and the whole film is very broken up chronologically. Interestingly Tarantino makes it work and each back-story or reflection is clever and the whole mass of all the flashbacks, some pertaining directly to the robbery some not, make for a big picture showing who these lowlifes really are.",

Although the acting is quite good -- I'd single out Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi -- this is Tarantino's movie. Nobody does controlled menace and uncontrolled violence the way he does. If it weren't a movie but something happening in front of our eyes, we'd trample one another to death in the rush to the exit. There haven't been many movies in my lifetime that inspire that sense of being in the middle of something absolutely dreadful. That goes especially for the scene in which one of the hoods carves up a young cop he's captured and prepares to burn him to a crisp before he is blown away himself. Definitely not for the squeamish.

The actors went along with him, all the way, to the smallest detail. Watch the end of the introductory breakfast scene, after Mr. Pink (Buscemi) explains his non-tipping philosophy. Joe (Tierney) returns to the table and commands Pink to pay up anyway and Pink finally complies. Eddie (Penn) sits very solemnly during this point, with his hands under his chin, as if in deep thought. What's he thinking about? Could it be he thinks I should've forced Pink to pay?

237,10 April 2021,CadeFilms,10, Near Perfect Story Of Deception & Instinct,"Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs is an absolute powerhouse of a debut feature film. However, there are a few specifics that keep me from seeing this as a perfect movie. Firstly, although the film's opening scene encapsulates exactly what each character stands for and inhabits within their personalities, it garnishes a few choices that detracts from its excellence. The cuts throughout the sequence, no matter how amazingly up close and personal they may be, do seem sloppy and without precision for most of its duration. Besides this, its also very apparent that Tarantino didn't really care too much about what I refer to as ""the restaurant cliche."" Yes, these characters are very outlandish and probably don't care about those around them so the volume of their conversation isn't an issue. However, to add to immersion, it would have been best if the audience could see reactive shots of the other customers in the establishment reacting to their embellished jokes and stories. Instead, its obvious that the other customers are bland extras without precise direction. Furthermore, there are another couple of intricacies later in the film that could easily have been fixed, such as Mr. White not lighting his cigarette for some odd reason and the bag of diamonds continuity error during Mr. Pink's escape sequence. Speaking of Mr. Pink's escape, its inclusion wasn't necessary at all. I do think that it was incredibly executed and beyond exciting. However, it detracted from the film's suspense since the audience now knows for 100% certainty that Mr. Pink couldn't be the rat. Anyways, besides these few criticisms, the film is amazing due to its performances, writing, incredible pacing, and every other aspect of film-making that one may consider important.",
238,18 March 1999,PIST-OFF,10, Without a question the greatest film ever. And I mean EVER!!!,"Reservoir Dogs is the coolest movie ever. Tarantino's directorial debut is perfect. His gift for writing great dialogue and not stereotyping his own characters is apparent from the get go. The cinematography and camera work are tributes to French film makers and their great technique. Harvey Keitel puts up his all time best performance as the very professional yet very gullible Mr White. Michael Madsen also puts out a career best as the psychotic but loyal Mr Blonde. Steve Buscemi and Tim Roth and Chris Penn also put out career high water marks. Quentin Tarantino throws in great stuff from old movie, inside jocks and ironic subliminal settings (the mortuary after a massacre) to make the movie great. Mr Blonde can be seen drinking from a Big Kahuna burger cup just like Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction. A killer soundtrack of mostly 70's music. A classic infamous super cool scene of Mr Blonde cutting off a cop's ear to the tune of Steeler's Wheel's ""Stuck In The Middle With You"" while the camera pans away leaving the viewer tortured by their own imagination.

A bunch of whiney hoods that cannot pull off a ""perfect"" jewelry heist. The plot (what plot) is just an excuse for Tarentino to stretch the limits of gore and sick violence. Again, we must suspend belief that all the shooting in the warehouse does not bring the cops. I realize this movie is set before cell phones, but someone must have heard the 4 or 5 shots Mr Orange gets off before the others arrive. Not to mention the head shots to the poor cop before others arrive. A really stupid Mexican standoff where the two worst guys are shot and Mr White is severely wounded? The timing is not realistic for the gunshots - White has to take out two guys that have their guns trained on him. The torture scenes are just sick. I'm surprised Tarentino didn't allow the lighter to drop on the gasoline trail just to add more torture for his drooling fans. Wouldn't we be better off without Tarentino's style (?) of movies? Even The Godfather had better violence - those thugs were killed off quickly. You wouldn't have one thug (Orange) hanging around bleeding internally and externally, and still able to have enough of his senses to kill Blonde? And why does someone place a gun next to Orange when they are waiting for a doctor? Just so Orange could shoot Blonde - the only reason. There are plot holes everywhere.",

It held the most exciting scenes and had the least amount of dialogue, which usually is a bad thing but this movie was straight dialogue. The lack of music, although quite eerie made me bored and tired. It gets good when the music does begin to play and the movie begins to feel more relaxed. The twist towards the end, while not anything too unique was exciting and interesting, I'm sure at the time of its release it wouldn't have been seen anywhere. The characters weren't anything special, which was the point, the audience isn't meant to feel sympathy for any of the ""reservoir dogs"" through personal information. This allows the smaller characters that were mixed up in the violence to be the ones we feel for. I liked Mr.Blonde a lot, he was the most interesting of the group and I thought to be the best acted. The beginning is, for me, where the movie falls flat, it was slow and added barely anything to the film as a whole. The scenes where far to long to not have music to fill up the empty space.

259,13 May 2010,zardoz-13,10, Taratino's First Crime Thriller is Far-Out!!!,"Writer & director Quentin Tarantino's freshman effort as a helmer concerns a ruthless criminal gang and a jewelry store robbery gone awry. Indeed, this is the movie that introduced audiences to Tarantino as a director. Ostensibly, without the participation of Harvey Keitel, this movie might never have attracted the critical and popular attention that it eventually garnered. Moreover, ""Reservoir Dogs"" would have qualified as little more than routine heist caper were it not for the distinctive Tarantino treatment. Compared with his later film ""Pulp Fiction,"" which reinvented the crime thriller, ""Reservoir Dogs"" qualifies as a relatively modest effort. Basically, an undercover Los Angeles cop infiltrates a gang of professional thieves and discovers that getting shot in the stomach is all in a day's work. No, this is not the kind of movie that prompt anybody to resort to a life of crime because everybody here faces the consequences of their actions. Squeamish people who abhor the sight of blood and gore might find Tarantino's film highly objectionable. When individuals are shot, they bleed profusely. One character spends more than half of the movie wallowing in a pool of his own blood. The most notorious scene involves a psychopath who tortures a tied-up Los Angeles policeman for information. During the interrogation, the hood carves off the cop's ear without a qualm. Those who prefer happy endings should definitely avoid this tragic thriller.",

I watched this movie as I had been told by so many people it was a classic film that could never die and I have to say i was seriously unimpressed. I am a movie viewer who on principal will watch all of a movie and then judge it because I think its unjustified to comment if you haven't got the whole picture but it basically ended up a pointless bloodbath.I can see why this movie got its violent reputation as with all tarantinos movies yet the others such as kill bill and pulp fiction do not seem quite as pointless as this. The acting however was of a good standard but with lines like this and a story this bad you have to be fantastic to even seem OK as an actor. Tarantino himself who appeared in the movie seems to much of a wet blanket to be connected in any way to this Mafia like gang and to be honest it was obvious to me who the policeman was before you found out.

The story is just messy and boring as hell, much of unrelated nonsense and jokes that aren't even close to funny. Reverse chronology and fragmentation is another fail which totally spoils the fun and destroys the movie. It's just so dumb when you think about the story, how can an undercover not stopping a gangster shooting other cops in a car? And telling him he's a cop to blow his own cover?? Yet a gangster standing up for someone he barely knew for a short period of time, shooting his own boss? It's just completely ridiculous and stupid.

A small group of mobsters are labelled by colour, and then they attempt to pull off a crime for which viewers are given the aftermath and flashbacks. A shootout leaves a few of them dead and others struggling to survive. Interesting developments but very violent. This is a great setup for promising director Quentin Tarantino who exposes the clichés through characters that are believable. Tim Roth is frantic because he is a wounded undercover officer who must rely on those he fooled and survive against the ones who suspect him. Michael Madsen is menacing torturing a cop in a disturbing scene where he severs an ear, but his confidence is overrun to a sudden halt. Harvey Keitel believes Roth's story going so far as to get him undercover after he is fatally wounded, but his friendship is tested in an extreme standoff. Steve Buscemi is given the best lines particularly a scene at a restaurant involving tipping. Buscemi is comic relief but also quite lucky in terms of his survival rate. Lawrence Tierney makes one of his last appearances as the criminal head. A great start for a director whose future is bright. It presents criminal lifestyles as a dead end paved in blood.

My memory of it was that it was violent but rather stagey being set in a warehouse and that there was a decent soundtrack. Clearly Tarantino's debut film is much more than that and if we think we have seen some of it in other films it is probably that those other films have come along afterwards. The innovation, audacity and sheer bloodyminded determination to present the world on film differently is most impressive. It really is a bravura opening with the chat in the cafe and cutting to the aftermath in all its bloody detail. Pretty visceral throughout, I recall the fuss upon the film's original release and although there have been other violent films things have probably quietened down in more recent cinema - certainly in the mainstream. But then maybe this never was a mainstream film despite awards and accolades. Great to discover it is still a great watch. Excellent.",

Quentin Tarintino has always been a master of dialogue I will give this movie that.  I just found this movie too long in spots.  Sometimes the characters tend to go on and on. It's one gangster talking to another.  One says `I think this @#$@%! guy is the cop' and than another gangster says `I think this guy is the ^$#&@ cop'.  That's the story. I was a little disappointed that most of the movie takes place in a garage with occasional flashbacks.

Why exactly? The acting of course, the dialogues of course and whether you like it or not, the admiration of brutal violence. What directors like de Palma or Scorsese were hiding is by Tarantino exposed till you puke... just watch how many dialogues are spoken by actors who are bleeding till death. Or the famous scene in where a cop looses an ear (all on the rhythm of Steelers Wheel's ""Stuck in the middle with you""...when an ear is cut the personages usually die after two seconds, by Tarantino they are living for 15 minutes or more while he isn't ashamed to make some close up's from the wounds...

It was something of a sensation back in the day and with good reason. Despite having a plot-line that was seemingly very derivative of an earlier Hong Kong crime flick, it was nevertheless an extremely fresh approach that Tarantino brought to the movies. He impressively went one better with his next feature Pulp Fiction but irrespective of that, Reservoir Dogs will always be regarded as one of the great debut features. Its influence was huge and many crime flicks followed its lead and featured wise-cracking bad guys and pop cultural references. The story focuses on a group of colour-coded thieves before and after a disastrous heist. They meet up at a prearranged rendezvous point at a warehouse and accusations begin to fly. Some are convinced it was a set-up, while the waters are muddied further by one of the team acting psychotically on the job.

It doesn't even really show the planning of the heist. But despite it lacking when it comes to scheming and planning things out while showing the whole process like ""Ocean's Eleven"". I was still intrigued and entertained throughout the whole running time. I just recently saw this film again, although I am still confused about the title of why it's called ""Reservoir Dogs. It's a magnetic film that drew me in and kept me focused. I still think this film is a bit overrated, I mean it's not one of the best films I have ever seen or anything like that. But I still think it's one heck of an accomplishment. I mean it's a crime film that revolves around a heist while not even showing the heist and yet it can entertain and entice the audiences is a accomplishment. It shows what happened before and after the heist but not the actual heist itself. What makes this movie stand out is not just the cool dialogues, but it's the stylishly cool and suave style of it all. Plus it does have some iconic scenes some people try to do a parody of, especially the introduction scene where the character walk to their cars.

A meaningless title, by the way, but it sounds cool -- which can suffice as a succinct summing-up of Tarantino's entire approach to film-making. On the one hand, a true cinephile can hardly despise *Reservoir Dogs*, as it pays fond homage to some pretty great films -- indeed, part of the fun of watching it is calling out your favorite film reference (the most meaty being the torture scene, cribbed -- with updated violence -- from Joseph L. Lewis' *The Big Combo* from 1955). On the other hand, a true cinephile can get pretty irritated with Tarantino for building an entire movie, and indeed an entire CAREER, out of a series of fond homages. Yes, it really is a case of the geek at your local video rental armed with $1.5 million and a camera or two actually making, like, a real movie and stuff.

With his on-and-off British accent and giveaway expressions even when Harvey Keitel is trusting him, I thought his performance was the weakest in the film.

There's also the nervous Mr. Pink, who was well played by Steve Buscemi. Chris Penn is well cast as the loud-mouth, suspicious Nice Guy Eddie.

307,6 May 2006,oldman007,10, An instant classic. one of the most important films ever made.,"This movie was very well made. Let me start off by saying that I'm not a fan on Quentin Tarintino. I can't stand his work. I thought Reservoir Dogs would be the same, but I was wrong. Just by judging the way the cover was, it looked like a gangster movie where they spend the whole movie in the bank, but it isn't. It's about the perfect robbery that gets organised and it goes terribly wrong. They then realise one of them is a cop, but which one, is it? It was quite a change to actually have a relationship with gangsters for once. It was good to know that gangsters are human too. In an evil way, but they are still human. Most people say ""They're gangsters, they're not human."" But it's not true. They are human. Quentin Tarintino makes them human. It explains their backgrounds and how they got their job, etc. It had great 70's songs too such as ""Stuck in the middle With You"" by Steeler's Wheel. The cast is fantastic. They do act childish in their situation, but who wouldn't? All he characters in this are so lovable. This film is very important because it's exactly what gangsters do and i'm 99% certain it's what they talk about. It's just good to have a relationship with bad guys for a change instead of the good guys all the time. I recommend it to Quentin tarintino lovers and people who love gangster films. 10/10 Advice: A lot of people hate reservoir Dogs, which is fine, but don't get mad. Don't say something like ""You just didn't get it and you're not adult"", it's the fact that they don't like it.Respect their opinion. You can't make everyone love the same movie.

Reservoir Dogs has a simple plot, but it's brilliance, lies in the way in how the stories told, in interesting use of flashbacks. I've never seen them work more beautifully in this film while being darn entertaining. We have nice little extras too. We hear a dirty side splitting tale, told by Penn, regarding an incident involving a p..is and wacko glue. We have another one in fictional flashback tale, as told by Roth in the Men's, which is occupied by four deputies. How the film starts off, is admirably great, in that pancake house where the suited up guys, all of dangerous ilk, are chinwagging and disputing the story behind Madonnas's hit 'Like a Virgin'. Minutes later when it comes to tip time, Mr Pink who eventually backs down (wuzz) argues over the point of tipping these waitresses, where through some of the dialogue here, sex is inferred. But also Mr Pink, argues about his low quota of coffee's he's been served. Then we hear more on the subject of tipping from Keitel's character here, who does the film solid. There's great moments of conflict and some frank and brutally bloody moments, like Roth bleeding all over the backseat, and in perpetual moments in the warehouse. Too is another cool scene, involving two cops massacred in their car, as Mr Keitel (Mr White) unloads. RD is a colourful crime thriller, and a great starting point for Tarantino. It's always the one fans are gonna look back on, as what evolved was a cult following from this uniquely talented young director who honestly can't be outdone. You couldn't ask for a finer cast or kickarse dialogue and script in a beautifully executed telling of story.",

Tarantino agreed, and he still got to direct the film too. Even before the movie, hit film festivals, Tarantino's name was echoed all over town. This film represents the birth of a new genre; The Tarantino. The movie incorporates many different genres into one, complete with Tarantino's own style of film-making with a very unique way of story telling. It is true, as Tarantino admitted, that this film did indeed ""rip-off"" older films, but the director did not just simply plagiarize, he improved what he took and made it his own (You could say he simply borrowed but did not have time and the rights to explain why he needed to borrow). The final result, however, marks a new trend in cinema; one that many filmmakers have tried to rip-off themselves.",

Although many of the edges are rough and the production budget is thin (a sacrifice Tarantino was happy to make in exchange for creative control), the director's voice is already fully realized and he pulls a number of powerful performances from his shockingly star-studded cast. Primary among these are Harvey Keitel as the guilt-ridden loyal soldier, Michael Madsen as his antithesis, a cold-blooded maniac, Tim Roth as the spark that ignites their fire and Steve Buscemi as the flabbergasted bystander who can't believe it's come to this.

330,1 May 2020,aidanratesmovies,9, Reservoir Dogs (1992),"Well directed, well acted, and incredibly grounded- Reservoir Dogs takes a new fresh stance for heist films and executes it rather well. The film's biggest issue in the end is its slow nature, or more specifically it's somewhat often slow pacing. However, if you can be patient with the film, it can be incredibly enjoyable. The film is spectacularly acted, with all actors truly giving it their all, most notably Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, and Michael Madsen. The film is very well written, with some very realistic and often humorous dialogue. The cinematography is often incredible, and its soundtrack is often very impressive. Tarantino's directing style may be very fresh out of the barrel with audiences first experiencing him from this film, but his directing style is no doubt extremely impressive, and thanks to him every small inch of the film seems perfectly tied together. In the end, Reservoir Dogs may not be the most entertaining film from Tarantino, but there is more than enough notable qualities to the film to make for a very enjoyable and well made piece of cinema unlike any other.

The plot is so full of holes that it is just ridiculous. I am so disappointed that I don't believe I will ever watch a movie by this director again. Watching this after 'Inglourious Basterds' made dissatisfaction even more unbearable. My advice: watch the first 45 minutes of this film and simply shut off the television. Ponder for several minutes as to the end result, but do not, under any circumstances, finish this calamity. I would not want to hear any more reports of self-mutilation or people gouging out their own eyeballs.

339,15 October 2017,a_chinn,10, Taratino's debut still holds up as a classic crime film,"I remember walking out of the theater after seeing this film the first time and telling my friend, ""If I ever make a movie, I'd want it to be something like this!"" Quentin Tarantino's movie obsessed personality completely clicks for me, with a fondness for exploitation and genre cinema, but balanced with a respect and understanding of classic and foreign cinema. ""Reservoir Dogs"" offers a perfect cocktail mix of pulp and art, equal parts Don Siegel and Joseph H. Lewis, but also equal parts Jean-Pierre Melville and David Mamet. The story is a straightforward heist film, but what Tarantino does differently is how he structures his story. Fro one, he never shows the actual heist and a majority of the film is the events following the failed heist, with flashbacks to events prior to said heist. Flackbacks have become a trademark of Tarantino's, but he uses them in a way that serves the story, providing necessary information for the audience at a specific time. Another major departure from standard heist films is Tarantino's dialogue, which is amazingly sharp and fun to listen to. No one write like he does, though he has plenty of imitators who've attempted to mimic his voice, it's a kind of artificial movie-speak that will either delight or annoy filmgoers. When you top all that off with an amazing cast, that includes Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Tim Roth, and classic film heavy Lawrence Tierney, it's hard to imaging this film going far wrong. Of special note, Madsen especially gives good in a can't-take-your-eyes-off-of-him performance as the psychotic Mr. Blond. Much like Anthony Perkins' performance in ""Psycho,"" this role for Madsen pretty much typecast him as a smiling villain for much of his career. Tarantino has been called out for copying much of the plot of Ringo Lam's Hong Kong action film ""City on Fire."" Without revealing any spoilers, the story is undeniably similar, right down to some very specific scenes. However, as good a film as ""City on Fire"" is, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is soooo much better. Tarantino clearly lifted many story elements from that film, but he used them to make a much stronger film. Re-watching this film now, another fun element is you get to watch Tarantino's cinematic universe begins to take shape, with character being potentially related to or appearing to other Tarantino stories, with the names Alabama (""True Romance""), Vega (""Pulp Fiction""), Skagnetti (""Natural Born Killers""), Marvin Nash (""Natural Born Killers"" and ""Pulp Fiction"") all getting mentioned at one point or another. But as I wrote at the top of this review, Tarantino completely has my number and his sensibilities seem perfectly in sync with my own, which is probably why I see ""Reservoir Dogs"" as a true cinematic classic.",

It's filled with humor, drama and great deal of blood, showcasing the early stages of a this masterful writer/director. It's hard to believe this is a debut film, from the expertly crafted dialogue, to the fairly minimal storytelling, one that comes forward in the character revelations, which are abundant. With only a few missteps, mainly some overacting this is a truly great gangster film and one that started the impressive career of Quentin Tarantino.

343,26 September 2003,chvylvr80,9, Tarantino's best so far,Reservoir Dogs is that rare movie that can be watched over and over and over again and you never grow tired of it. Tarantino's gift for writing great dialogue is never more evident than it is in this film. The dialogue is what makes his movies so great. The characters talk like real people instead of sounding like they're reading from a book. Reservoir Dogs doesn't show you most of the action but prefers to involve you in the panicked recollections of the thieves as they try to suss out the rat amongst them. Great performances by all involved and a K-tel ready soundtrack help make Dogs a great movie to watch. This film is arguably the movie in Tarantino's bag that has the smallest scope. It doesn't take place in a lot of places like Jackie Brown and has a smaller cast of characters than either Brown or Pulp Fiction. We have to wait until the release of Kill Bill Vol.1 and 2 to see if he can top his first effort. Bottom Line: Brilliant moviemaking from the modern crime master. If you haven't seen this then you really need to step away from the computer and go get it. If you have seen it and you don't have the DVD special edition then you may be forgiven for your sloth at not picking it up yet. Go get it. Mr. Blonde version if you please.,

354,20 September 2000,rdoyle29,10, A dazzling blend of influences and originality,"The script for ""Reservoir Dogs"" was written in just three weeks and is a blend of originality, enthusiasm, and homage.  Quentin Tarantino worked in a video store and turned himself into a sponge and encyclopedia of cult, often violent, marginal and sometimes classic cinema.  The film is dedicated to, among others, the cult figures Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Pierre Melville, Chow Yun Fat, and Roger Corman.  The taut screenplay is filled with references to Tarantino's favourite films:  ""The Killing"", ""White Heat"", ""Rififi"", ""Ocean's Eleven"", and ""Straight Time"" (based upon the book by Eddie Bunker, who plays Mr. Blue), among many others.  The concept of a gang of mutual strangers known only by colours appears in the New York subway heist film, ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"", one of Tarantino's favourites.  A key source was another Tarantino favourite, Ringo Lam's ""City On Fire"", which features Chow Yun Fat as an undercover cop infiltrating a jewel gang, scenes in a cafe, a sequence where the cool-looking gang walk in hip, bedraggled unity towards the camera, and concludes with an identically composed Mexican stand-off.  Another source was ""Odd Man Out"".  The film is fascinating for its complex borrowings, but most admirable for the profane poetry of the dialogue, the complexity of the narrative structure (similar to ""Rashomon""), and the stylishly camp soundtrack.  It is supremely cool, and gained an instantly devoted following.  Everything about it was taken from somewhere else, and yet it has a style all of its own that established the Tarantino signature - a look and sound all its own.",

Mostly consisting of dialogue of pointless banter between the characters dragging out for uncomfortable amounts of time, the story had a weak plot and built up to nothing.

356,7 December 2005,adrongardner,7, Nice but not that nice,"Dogs is a decent movie, but time has not made it better. I like a lot about Reservoir Dogs. The acting is good and even though the movie is small, we get a convincing Tarantino world painted around us. The dialog is good and funny as we expect but some of the writing is a little dry and plotting slow. The aftermath of the robbery and the history of an informant pervade the entire storyline. The limited set pieces keep the movie simple but also show that it was clearly written with a very low budget in mind, as such it feels limited in scope with some probably claiming that is part of the point. Whatever. I think there are a few scenes that are downright boring. Joe and Mr. White's exchange in the office is a snooze but the ""Comode"" soliloquy Roth memorizes to convince his fellow robbers of his authenticity is brilliant.

I don't know whether the film gets any better, I don't care if it does. Movies like Mean Machine are dull to start with too, but at least not detrimentally so, so when that movie turned out to have one of the greatest climaxes I've ever seen, it managed to pull itself up two marks, but if after 20 minutes I'm left skimming through chapters not even caring about story while I'm looking for at least a good action scene then a movie has failed me. I don't know. Maybe I had high expectations, considering I've very recently watched both Pan's Labyrinth and Grave Of The Fireflies very recently, but then again, Mean Machine. At least movies like Battle Royale II have serviceable action (and hilariously bad acting, an area which I will give Reservoir Dogs praise for - the acting is great, be it because the entire cast are accomplished actors) between the sections of boredom. It doesn't even make good background sound, lest I want to be pouted with ni**er every other second. I don't see how you can stick with this movie at all. Now, it doesn't deserve anything lower than 3/10, that's designated for particularly diabolical pieces of media, like Fred or Jeff Dunham. It doesn't deserve anything higher, either, though.

Reservoir Dogs is a wonderfully made film with some great performances, that was expected the thing that I still fail to see how happened is how Quentin Tarantinos script was so bad. The dialogue is still amazing as it is in all Tarantino films but the story is horrible, it is filled with clichés and hardly makes any sense. Tarantinos usual thing about not having the film in the order of how it happened like most films just makes this film more confusing and pointless. The saving points are that it does have several very good scenes. ""Spoilers"" 1. The naming. 2. When Mr. Orange is talking to his cop friend. 3. The ending.

366,7 March 2015,Screen_Blitz,9," Quentin Tarantino's mobster flick is very violent and bloody, but superbly entertaining","Quentin Tarantino has scaled the ladder of Hollywood filmmakers since his directorial debut in 1992. With his unique style of filmmaking and writing, Tarantino has established himself as a masterful Hollywood mogul. Although his magnum opus 'Pulp Fiction' placed the director in the front ranks of Hollywood filmmakers, it was this brutal crime- drama that place Tarantino in the cinematic radar. Blossoming with a cutthroat script, audacious humor, and a masterfully artistic representation of violence, this mobster drama showcases the fine director's snappy filmmaking talent in arguably one of his most polishes forms yet. It is violent, it is brutal, and it is darkly funny in shocking ways. Most importantly, it is a raw gangster flick that pays a fair amount of homages to the classic film-noir genre of the 50s and 60s, and that is only half of what makes this movie subversively entertaining. This film stars Lawrence Tierney as Joe Cabot, a mob boss who hires a group of gangsters under the names Mr. White (played by Harvey Keital), Mr. Blonde (played by Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink (played by Steve Buscemi), Mr. Orange (played by Tim Roth), Mr. Brown (played by Quentin Tarantino), and Mr. Blue (played by Edward Bunker) to rob a jewelry store in attempt to their hands on some precious diamonds.

The gang of thieves sit around a table in a restaurant making conversation about tips and waitressing being the only place an uneducated woman can get work.

The rest of the film takes place in a warehouse after the diamond heist has gone wrong. The dying man is Tim Roth, and his flashbacks tell his story. Harvey Keitel and Buscemi have minutes of dialogue on what went wrong and what should be done now.
Flashbacks show what went wrong. The pace is quick. There is a dancing crook with a razor. Gasoline. Gunshots. More gunshots.
The reveal. More gunshots.

Anyway I've not watched Reservoir Dogs in years. When Pulp Fiction came out, it was fashionable to say yeah it's great, but not as great as Reservoir Dogs. The truth is though, I always preferred Pulp Fiction. It was easy on the eye, fast paced, exciting, quotable, full of cartoon characters, but dangerous ones. This is a little different, but Tarrantino's debut is notable for several things, the non-linear storytelling, that scene in all its shocking nature and... the dialogue. The beautifully mundane dialogue. Steve Buscemi's stance on not tipping, Tarantino pulling apart Madonna's Like a Virgin. It's, well it's just marvellous, perfectly setting the characters before the opening credits roll with Little Green Bag over those slow motion shots of them all in matching suits, like a giant neon sign 'This is gonna be cool', but prepare to have your brain worked over. Then wham!, before the music even finishes, Tim Roth is in the back of a car screaming his head off, covered in blood as Harvey Keitel tries to keep him calm while driving. As far as getting into the action fast, Dogs does not disappoint. Mr Pink (Buscemi) explodes into the safe house with conspiracies of a set up, after an apparent heist. We're not told what's happening, there's no hand holding, it's a simple story but you have to let it breathe. It's difficult to watch this now without the knowledge of what's happened or is going to happen, but the entire premise is to put you right there in the room, trying to figure out what the hell just happened like Pink and White (Keitel) are... whilst Orange (Roth) bleeds out on the floor. The little drip fed bits of info, Mr Blonde (Micheal Madsen) going nuts ""Shooting the place up"", it's tells you as much about events unseen at the heist, as character traits that lead to what's yet to happen. What I had forgetter about was the camera work, it's as important as the dialogue, leading you around the room and through the conversation. When it pulls back to Mr Blonde's shoulder as he watches White and Orange's stand off, guns drawn and simply says ""You kids shouldn't play so rough"" it adds another layer of danger and confusion. Some of the flashback stuff with the crew meeting the brains behind the diamond heist, Joe, does feel added on, extra, non-essential. Especially with Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) and Blonde. I'll forgive the commode story with Orange though, although it's superfluous, it's nice detail and a lot of fun the way it builds. It's lengthy too, taking us out of the warehouse where things are pretty intense. The lovely nugget all the way through is Orange on the floor, everyone else accounted for or right in the thick of it. Granted we're kept guessing a little about Blue, but we know Brown (Tarantino) ""Took one in the head"". Although that's not strictly true. What is undeniable is as Blonde takes his jacket off I'm already nervous. I could never watch this scene, it's beyond harrowing. The cop begging, the gasoline, the dancing toward his prey, the tension is thick and when the switchblade comes out and I'm wondering if I'll half watch through my fingers. Of course there's no need really, the camera drifts, the mind filling in the gaps, but it's still brutal, if only of the coldness of Blonde as he tells the cop what's about to happen. The music is iconic here, notable too by the lovely breaker as Blonde goes to the trunk of the car, leaving the tortured cop and the music inside. Setting up probably the best back from the dead scene in movie history, as Pink wakes up and unloads on Blonde who's about to torch the cop. I remember watching this for the first time and being as blown away as Blonde! What follows is glorious, a pieces falling into place finale and if Pink was the show stealer before (he's my fave), then Roth as Mr Orange is a bloody close second, as it's revealed exactly who is who and what. It's methodical, packed with style and charisma and still stands up as a remarkable piece of cinema. A wonderful precursor for his best film which was just around the corner.",

One year before that was Tarantino's second film `True Romance', starring Patricia Arquette & Christian Slater. `True Romance', `Pulp Fiction', `Natural Born Killers', and many other projects written by Tarantino were a spin-off of his first film `Reservoir Dogs'. This film is about a man named Joes Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) who runs a crime business. Cabot is a rich man (thanks to theft) and is wanted by the police. Cobot is a very popular man, and is loved and respected by many of his thief-soldiers. Uncut diamonds are being imported to a store, and Cobot wants his hands on it. He hires six men to do a four-man job. Cobot has everything all planned out (like he always does). He gives his thieves names, so if there's a rat in the house, there will be a less of a chance of getting caught because they don't know your name.

They are not to tell anything about themselves to each other, such as their real name, their wife's name, when/where they did time, where they're from, or a bank they robbed. The robbery is all planned out, very well. But something goes wrong! While robbing the store, they are suddenly surrounded by cops. Mr. Pink (Steven Buscemi) has a good feeling that they were set up. Some of the thieves got away, some got killed, and maybe some got caught. The survived thieves meet back at the rendezvous and finally come to the conclusion that; one of the six thieves, Joe Cobot, or his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn), is an undercover cop. Throughout the film they try to figure out who the cop is. There is no actual main character. There are three main characters in this film; Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth). Those three are the principle characters in this film. This is a very good film. The first five minutes might be slow for some of you, but it's there so you get to know the characters.

But it only shows the before and after of the jewel heist. The details of the heist are explained in the aftermath and also by using your imagination of what happened. The movie begins with the crew going to a diner for breakfast before pulling off the job and a bunch of small talk ensues. Then cut to after the credits to where they're all showing up at the meet up place after the heist goes wrong and not everyone makes it back alive. Accusations towards each other about why things went wrong ensue with each other turning on each other.,

417,18 March 2003,WriterDave,7, Solid but far from greatness,"There's really not much to this flick.  It's an ultra-slick, highly stylish, ultra-violent quasi-gangster flick about an undercover cop working a sting on a diamond heist.  If you like this kind of thing, then you will get a big kick out of this, but otherwise, avoid it at all costs.  Tarantino, in his debut directorial gig shows he has a panache for very interesting dialogue (that usually has nothing to do with the plot) and a very stylish director's hand.  This flick is far superior to his overly praised ""Pulp Fiction,"" (**) which in my mind was a sloppily put together episodic flick that had some decent movie moments but ultimately had nothing to say beyond its own shock value.  Tarantino's only other turn at direction was ""Jackie Brown,"" (***) which for me was his only real ""film"" whose only downfall was that it took its sweet time getting around to what it had to say about midlife crises. As it stands, ""Reservoir Dogs"" (**1/2) is a solid flick but nothing great. If you want all this clever crime caper/con-game stuff without all the ultra-violence but still have the great dialogue, I recommend the work of David Mamet (""The Spanish Prisoner"" or ""Heist"" should do the trick).",

Stories full of cool characters, non-linear events, music and pop culture, and of course, lots of violence. Tarantino directed the movie, and also appeared as Mr. Brown. The story in ""Reservoir Dogs"" involves a jewel heist, even though the crime is never seen. The men hired for the heist are all strangers to each other, and all given aliases, to prevent them all from learning anything about each other. But the heist soon goes awry, and it ends violently. Two scenes in particular stand out about this movie: one is the infamous scene in which Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) slices off a cop's ear, a violent scene which is mostly implied. The other is the Mexican standoff scene near the end, a very tense moment. Tarantino has proved his power as a groundbreaking filmmaker with ""Reservoir Dogs.""",

A heist goes horribly wrong and the remaining criminals try to work out who the police informant is. It's set mostly in one location, and as the tension builds in the gangster's hideout the film becomes so unbearably intense it threatens to explode through the screen. Less a film, more a mind blowing, pulse pounding powerhouse, Reservoir Dogs is certainly one of the defining films of the 90s. It's quite a disturbing film at times and those who are squeamish should stay away. The violence makes the movie even more powerful, but it does get nasty at times. The film could be seen as style over substance by some and it won't be everyone's cup of tea; however, you can't really find anything else like it. Aside from Quentin Tarantino's other films of course.

As we go we get flashbacks to establish backstories for each of them, and how they came to be involved in the heist. But Reservoir Dogs makes it abundantly clear that the heist is not the point. It is never shown, only ever alluded to, leaving audiences to piece it together as the movie goes on.

430,30 April 2017,eagandersongil,8, The beauty in the simplicity of a gangster movie. By Quentin Tarantino.,"""Rent Dogs"" transpires style and charm, in his first film, Quentin Tarantino shows the public all his cinematographic resources, ranging from the script to the use of cameras, through cuts and soundtrack, even if many of the resources are abandoned later , Quentin arrives with his foot in the door bringing a gangster movie that closes almost an intersection between films of the genre of directors like Brian de Palm, Martin Scorsese and Coppola, because it brings the tone and photography would be alienated the irony, joke and humor black. With a Linear script that has several tours to the past, we have a movie about a theft to jewelry, where the robbery is not shown, and this is absolutely brilliant, as we see the consequences and discussions about what happened, imagine the scene, Tarantino Gives us the brushes and we paint the screen, it is worth noting how Tarantino completely develops his characters only through dialogues, although later in the film has scenes of pure developments that are played on the screen. We have a history of a group of 5 criminals who are hired by a mafia to steal a jewelry store, but their plans end up being very, very wrong to find out that one is an infiltrator. The film does not establish any type of morals, nor does it need to, this is not its function. We have a photograph that contrasts strong shades of gray with warm colors, although at times it seems careless, it is beautiful, filmed completely in roll, at times it seems that we are watching a film of the 70s, and that is a compliment, because it brings A giant charm the film, without original songs but orchestrated by pop music of the 70s, its track is completely irreverent and dictates the rhythm of certain scenes, besides making the viewer want to dance, its use in opposition to violence and crime is a Complete discord, we hate to love it. With a good sound mix and a completely fabulous editing, the publisher Sally Menke has many merits for leaving the film round and the famous expression ""Tarantinesca"" passes through her hands, and of course, we can not ignore the camera angles, the Tarantino's famous counter-plongée camera is used a lot here, not to mention its circulations on the bar table and its angle in the ""Mexican Impashes"" promoted by the director. All the actors are very well here, save a highlight for Steve Buscemi and especially Tim Roth who freaks out on the scene, even though there is a good part of the film on the bloody floor, obviously we can not fail to mention Harvey Keitel. Finally, the first Tarantino film has errors, such as the overdevelopment of certain characters and a rhythm problem; besides, Tarantino never marks his acts (which is a style, not exactly a defect) even though it is full of Charm, although very simple, it has a giant cinematic quality and certainly the few features contribute to the inherent beauty of ""Rent Dogs""",

Could be acted on a stage. It reminded me of Oscar Wilde. It is also extremely well-acted by all concerned. The Tarantino trademark is the depiction of criminals as just like everybody else, with the same sort of conversation and preoccupations, outside the lawlessness and obscenity. What do they call hamburgers in France ? Interesting point. I wouldn't want to be called Mr Pink. I have to admit that the violence is off-putting, after it's been experienced once.

I like several of the actors and some of the characters are good and there were a few moments that made me laugh but overall I found myself bored on several occasions wondering when a scene would end so we could get on with it. It may have been really unique in 1992 and a ton of movies have been influenced by it but I don't think it has aged well.

At the time of its popularity, Tarantino had to guardedly fend off accusations of plagiarism and a charge of just hacking from older classic heist movies.

466,14 August 2021,x_manicure_x,9, Wordy but stylish,"""Reservoir Dogs"" pays obvious homage to Stanley Kubrick's ""The Killing"", but at the same time reinvents the film noir formula thanks to its director's referential yet highly personal style. First of all, it's a heist film without the heist: the camera only shows us the setting up and the aftermaths. It's closer to a theatrical play than it is to a movie, with a bunch of men exchanging dialogue in a warehouse where comedy, surreal and grotesque seem to coexist. It's a simple, low budget, one-setting film where the iconic characters do most of the job, thanks to the combination of an excellent cast with Tarantino's gripping, black humor-driven dialogues. It's a lot of lengthy conversations to deal with, but every single line is gold and tells so much about each character that there is no need for explanations or complicated backstories. The non-linear storytelling, which would later become one of Tarantino's style trademarks, helps to keep the tension high and sheds different lights on each character as the film unfolds. The story itself is really nothing new, but all twists still manage to kick in at the most unexpected time, sometimes with significant changes in mood or shocking consequences. ""Reservoir Dogs"" has been notoriously known for its unapologetic violence, but it's actually one of Tarantino's least graphic films. As with the heist, it's more about what's ""told"" than what is ""shown"": Mr. Blonde's infamous torture scene or the final set-off manage show really little but still manage to feel so cold and brutal. It's far from being Quentin Tarantino's most polished or ambitious work, but somehow still one of my favorites, if not my ultimate favorite of his.",

From Mr.Pink's ""no tipping policy"" to Mr.White and Mr.Blonde's hilarious dispute to Mr.Orange self-encouraging words in front of the mirror, all the way up to the last line of the movie.

It's not clear that he had a low budget to play with, because what he's done with it is superb. A robbery gone wrong force a group of criminals, only known by different colours (Mr. White, Mr. Pink etc.) into an abandoned warehouse, to await help. In the mean time, they work out who the mole is. Tarantino fleshes out characters motives with a speech driven screenplay, music that defines memory and the ability to play on our imaginations. Madsen, Buscemi, Keitel and Roth are astutely incomparable, their given names matching their sporadic personalities. Reservoir Dogs is a profound start to Tarantino's career; one that's hard to beat with an unbeatable style, fast paced dialogue and an unforgettable scene that, whenever Stuck in the Middle With You by Stealers Wheel comes on, springs to mind instantly.",

483,25 December 2002,TheyKilledTheGiggler,10, Brilliant Film. Quentin Tarantino rules!!,"Perhaps one of the greatest films ever made, Reservoir Dogs is a relentless and fierce film from beginning to end. Director/Writer/Actor Quentin Tarantino directs and screenwrites this film about a group of criminals put together to pull off a diamond heist. The simple heist goes horribly wrong leaving a huge mess for the criminals to sort out. In the middle of the main plot the film also tells about each character and their aliases. (which are based on colors) The film stars: Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange, Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde, Chris Penn as Nice Guy Eddie, Lawrence Tierney as Joe Cabot, and the voice of Steven Wright as the hillarious DJ K Billy. All of the acting in this film is far past excellent. Mr favorite actor in this film has got to be Steve Buscemi, who turns in an excellent performance as ""The Professional"" criminal and cynical Mr. Pink. On screen the film contains many shocking visuals including the infamous ""ear"" scene played to the song ""Stuck In the Middle With You."" Throughout the film all of the criminals are trying to figure out which, if any of the members is an undercover cop because it seems like they were set up. I won't give way any more details but all i have to say is that this film is revolutionary and paved the way for the visonary Quentin Tarantino who would release his greatest accomplisment in 1994 with Pulp Fiction. Buy this movie right now (get the special edition 10 year anniversary DVD) and enjoy one hell of a ride!",

The film starts off with the classic Tarantino side-talking routine, that he would later explore in Pulp Fiction. It slowly develops into a violent thriller in the vein of The Killing (1956). There is something compelling and original about all the violence and destruction in this film that separates it from other thrillers like it. It's hip and cool but it also has the same artistry that made The Killing such a successful film. Keitel is great and he has a good cast to give him back up.",

You never see the heist that went wrong. You see the characters before and after. Then you just hear what the characters saw. That's why the dialogue in this movie is so important, because without it, we wouldn't know anything about what happened. But if several people see one event, they all see different things.

Other than the acting, which was actually very good, everything else about the movie was mediocre. Quentin Tarantino thinks that you can simply use chaos to replace good storytelling and that's just not the case. This is a cult classic but like most of those, it's majorly overrated. Outside of the opening scene, nothing about the movie was entertaining in any way and really could've been told just as well in 20 minutes. Honestly, that's what Tarantino does. He takes a 15 minute story and fools the audience into thinking it's a halfway decent movie by using over an hour of fluff to fill out time between the constant back-and-forth of the plot. The acting and the opening scene earned the movie a 5/10. Anything more than that and people are just lying to themselves because they want to feel part of the cult following.

Reservoir Dogs is excellent proof of that and is one of the best casted movies that i can remember in a long time. Chris Penn (rip) who i thought wasn't that great of an actor during his short lived career, however he was brilliant as well. If you have never seen any of Tarantino's work, then i definitely suggest starting here as it will only leave you either wanting more or not. You see you either love Quentin or you don't their doesn't seem to be any in between. I myself before seeing this for the first time (RD was my very first Tarantino film ) did not like to sit through films that were heavy in dialogue as i found them immensely boring. That changed and was only cemented after also viewing his Pulp Fiction (Another character/dialogue enriched film).",

It's a pretty funny movie, and anybody who watches it will have a good laugh. It blends comedy and drama together very well in my opinion. Here's my take on the ""bad guys"": Mr. Blonde: The homicidal maniac of the bunch. This is one of the craziest dudes I've seen in a movie in a long time. He loves to torture people just for the sheer fun of it. This guy has a few screws loose in his head. Overall, a well played character, but I just do not like Michael Madsen.",

499,10 May 2019,PCT1970,8, Tarantino's Inception Of Storylines & Title Cards,"Tarantino's debut film as a director is a virtuous crime / mystery drama. Now considered by many as a cult classic, little did fans know this was the beginning of a stellar and unparalleled career. This is the first time that we catch a glimpse of Tarantino's penchant for intertwining storylines and the usage of title cards. It proves to be a foreshadowing of the dazzling brilliance to follow. This film has outstanding direction, cinematography, screenplay, soundtrack and acting. All of the actors involved which include the likes of Keitel, Buscemi and Penn deliver realistic and superb performances. In particular two stand out. Madsen with his portrayal of a homicidal maniac and Roth with his portrayal of a duplicit character. The plot revolves around six criminals known only as Mr. Brown, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Pink, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blue and Mr. White. They are hired by mob boss Joe Cabot and his son "" Nice Guy"" Eddie over a riotous and crisp diner scene. The six thieves are hired to pull off a bank heist, however before that they never worked together. They are amushed by police and a shooting ensues. At their rendezvous point the remaining survivors realize they were set up. Now they must flush out the rat in the group. The ending has one of the most brutal, bombastic and cathartic showdowns on film. The plot is clever, funny, bloody, inventive, dark, gritty, intense, violent and has a phenomenal duplicitous ending. There are so many memorable scenes. This viewer is still haunted by Madsen's scene where he psychologically and physically assaults a police officer being held captive.To this day you'll hear fans of this classic quote famous lines such as, ""Are you gonna bark all day little doggie, or are you gonna bite?"". This is a memorable film and remains a bravura work of art in it's genre.",
500,10 July 2007,PeterWilliamson,10, Reservior Dogs is an Excellent Movie,"I think Reservior Dogs is an absolutely brilliant movie. The cinematography is (in my opinion) the best that Quentin Tarantino has done (closely followed by others). Both the lighting and the camera angles in the scene when Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) is approaching Marvin Nash with the shaver was absolutely superb. I think, when the camera focuses on Marvin in that scene, it is probably the best camera shot I have ever scene. It's twists and turns made the movie gripping and (I don't know about other people) but, I found it hard to blink through this movie, not wanting miss one bit of the brilliant and sometimes humorous dialogue. The way the movie ended was great, with Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), running away with the diamonds, the prize possessions of the movie, the goods; after all he did was say how he wanted to, (and almost did) leave the area and then hid while the rest of them shot each other up over who they thought the cop was.

501,11 January 2017,cdjh-81125,8, Tarantinos Humble Beginnings,"Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest directors of the last few decades, he seamlessly blends dialogue with brutal violence in his films which are always compelling and extremely entertaining, while is do not think this is his best film Reservoir Dogs is a fantastic opening to his filmography. The dialogue in this film is absolutely perfect, it makes the film feel genuine, characters talk about random things that don't always have relevance to the plot but it feels like what real people would do in this situation which makes this film feel real. Another thing that feels real in this film is the violence, this is an extremely bloody movie but not to an excessive level it helps to establish the dangers these characters are presented with and gives the film a grittier edge. This film always had me engaged, Tarantino perfectly built up this central mystery perfectly it keeps you guessing for the entire run time and your more than likely to change your mind at least once. All the performances in this film are fantastic with the standouts probably being Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel, Roths character is in pretty much excruciating pain for most of the film and he's never not convincing, your always convinced that he is in as much pain as he says he is and it was just brutal to watch. All the characters have amazing interaction in this Film they're all set up as very different people which makes them more interesting to watch together. This film is told in a non linear fashion and for the most part it worked, it helped to establish the mystery and the characters better but they didn't always work for me, a lot of them show how the characters came to be on this job but I felt that the film contradicted itself by doing this, it's established that all of them are mysterious figures with no backstory so telling us this was just an odd choice and honestly they just didn't add much to this film. I also don't feel the pull to re watch this film like Tarantinos other films but I think that's just me. ",

503,14 August 1998,Sickfrog,10, The Purest Evil,"Quentin Tarantino proved his cinematic genius to the entire film industry with the revolutionary Pulp Fiction. Yet, several years before that, he burst onto the scene with this film, with just as masterful a showcase of solid, colorful ensembles of characters, dramatic empathy for usually unsympathetic archetypes and gory violence subdued and made watchable by mixing a sadistic sense of humor and style into the mix. Michael Madsen delivers one of the most frightening performances ever seen in modern cinema as Mr. Blonde, a devil-may-care sociopath. After watching his most graphic scene, you will never be able to listen to ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" in the same way again. Also, Havey Kietel and Tim Roth give the film its most touching edge, as Kietel's Mr. White develops a very paternal relationship to the mortally-wounded Mr. Orange, creating a trust and honor to protect him at any cost, which is just what he is challenged with. The cast is rounded out with equally remarkable performance by the likes of Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn and Laurence Tierney as this drama eventually hits a crucial peak, leaving you with a climax that won't soon be forgotten, even when listening to the spookily sedate Harry Nillson song ""Coconut"" as the credits roll.",

This story however is quite simple and indeed what gives this film personality are the characters. They are interesting and well characterised and the team they are a part of has a fun dynamic. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is far from the best works by Tarantino but I think it's natural because it was his first movie and then he has matured more and more as far as his artistic consciousness.

However, the only actor I did like watching and did act well was Tim Roth for he is a superb actor. The scenes of the gangsters in the warehouse arguing and torturing the Policemen/Marvin Nash, I thought was childish, bad acting(especially by Mr.Pink/Steve Buscemi) for they clowned around talking non-sense and when they weren't doing that, they were either killing one another or behaving like kids on trying to find out who the rat of the pack was.

513,19 December 2007,film_riot,7, Reservoir Dogs,"""Reservoir Dogs"" was the kick-off to Quentin Tarantino's so far fabulous career. It is a very energetic heist movie, that already uses the style of non-linear time structure. For example, a thing that I find very interesting about it is the scene where all the gangsters get to know each other and get their new name  this scene is set nearly at the end of the film. Really great here is also the dialogue, Tarantino's trademark. It starts with the discussion about ""Like a Virgin"" and, my personal favourite, the discussion about giving tip. Endless discussions, all written really sharp, follow about who is the traitor. In those moments where no one is talking, more than once it gets violent, as in that classic scene where Michael Madsen cuts ear to ""Stuck in the Middle with You"". And there we have another Tarantino trademark, the soundtrack, that fits perfectly, like always. My problem with some of Tarantino's films, including this one, is that they are too cool, there is too few room for real characters with real emotions.",

525,4 June 2005,WordtwisterMN,10," Great story, wonderful camera work.","I had seen this movie years ago, but forgot most of it. I'm so glad that I watched it again. Now I had the chance to really enjoy the dialog, music and camera work. The camera work impressed me the most. It was shot with a look Hitchcock could appreciate. The direction reminded me of some of the great westerns. The camera brings you into a one-on-one relationship with the actor as much as possible for a movie. The dialog is hip, very hip...and leaves the viewer laughing, frowning and in deep concern from time-to-time. This is one movie where the music does play its fair part in the movie. So many times music is just an addition to a movie, written to be a part of the movie. I'm not sure if the movie was sometimes written around a song, but the music was perfect with the crime, and or the sentence. Reservoir Dogs, over many years could become one of the top rated American films. Almost everything was perfect. However, whether on purpose, or to play with the fans; I did see the shadow of a boom microphone in a scene. I'm guessing that's what happens with perfectionists who write and direct movies. In Pulp Fiction, I saw the holes appear in the apartment room before the actual shots were fired. Not many directors and writers could let something so obvious slide by without leaving us guessing if he did this purposely. Same with Kill Bill, Tarantino allowed the parody of blood squirting from limbs. Reservoir Dogs is a beautiful movie in all aspects. Enjoy a true American story!",

Quentin Tarantino's first film is not just the movie that set his career, but his finest work. I find it hard to explain, but this movie defines some of the super-violent crime thrillers we see today. Each character is well- developed and causes me to be emotionally attached. Each character is set to act in a certain way that inevitably leads to conflict. Those who see will understand that statement. Here are some pros and cons (the cons do not apply to myself because I don't see them as such). Pros: 1. Symbolic (again, hard for me to explain but those who watch intently will pick it up) 2.

545,22 July 1999,V Hanna,10, Better Than Pulp!!,"This movie is better than Pulp Fiction. Let's get that straight right now. I have seen it a number of times and it just keeps getting better. The story line is fresh, the casting perfect, camera shots are unique, and the sound bites original. Oh yea, the soundtrack is great too. Six guys commit a robbery and you don't even see it. You spend the whole movie watching the planning of the caper and the turmoil afterwards. Harvey Keitel may have given his best performance of his career and Steve Buscemi is a classic. In fact it's Buscemi's 'Mr. Pink' (there is a great line in response to his disapproval to the color pink) weasel character that I feel is the gasoline in the Reservoir Dogs engine. He represents the voice of reason and clear thinking on one point and sneaky and scheming on the other. Michael Madsen's 'Mr. Blonde' was made for him. Tim Roth 'Mr. Orange' has his ground breaking role (I can't say what as because it ruins part of the plot). Chris Penn and Lawrence Tierney are perfect as the father son mob team. What is really great about this movie is the dialog. Some of the best ever and truly original. The dialog in Reservoir Dogs flows so smoothly and naturally that it gives a more than a movie feel to it. For example the part in the bathroom with the cops standing around talking was beautiful because that is how how cops chit chat to each other about who's butt they busted or how stupid this guy was. Tarantino even had the cops talking about it with that kind of smirky ego locker room talk. That and having Roth break in and continue his description of the story right there was great. Also, the opening scene is a bona fide classic. The Madonna speech, the discussion on tipping, everything about that was great dialog. I also love the way Madsen and Keitel go back and forth at one point in the movie (""I bet you're a big Lee Marvin fan""). If you haven't seen the movie yet be prepared because it jumps around between past and present like 'Godfather 2'. But, that is also part of the genius of it. It's bloody, so if you hate violence go rent a Disney movie instead and save yourself from stopping a great movie and complaining that this is what causes violence in youths. Wrong (that's another argument I won't get into but we can't make every movie for 10 year olds and if they happen to get a hold of it where were you when they did!). Reservoir Dogs goes on the classic list. It's a top of the shelf action movie with dark comedy and great lines to boot. One word of advice to Mr. Tarantino, stop putting yourself in your movies. You are not an actor! Stick to directing where you do your best work.",
546,23 July 2000,dogg01,9, Stuck in the middle with you.,"There are few films that have revolutionised cinema. Citizen Kane. The Godfather. Jaws. Die Hard. Reservoir Dogs. Before Reservoir Dogs came onto the scene, we were stuck with any crappy script making it's way to film within a year of it being written. The 80s were a bad time for movies. The excellence of the 70s movies(Godfather, Jaws, Apocalapse Now, Taxi Driver) had gone. Video had meant cinemas were not as popular as before. Then came one small film made an a tiny budget with no- name (except Harvey Keitel) actors, written and directed by a newcomer who had dropped out of school at 16 and worked in a video store until now. This little film was the best thing to happen in cinema for a long time. It was a simple story about a heist gone wrong. It was set in a warehouse. But it was told with a set of flashbacks to make it more complicated than that. There were pop-culture refrences throughout this film, and the acting was superb. Did I mention it contained lots of profanitisin' and violence which sparked up controversy? A cops ear being cut off to the sounds of 'Stuck in the middle with you'. This was a great film without cliche's and was incredibly original(apart from the fact that it was a story 'borrowed' from 'city on fire'. Tarantino's 2nd best.",

It establishes the main question right in the beggining (who betrayed them?), right after showing us the great relationship of 'friendship' the group has. It keeps you wondering until the third act and, in the mean time, conflicts between the group arise. Just as any Tarantino film, this is a blood fest, non-linear story. The characters feel authentic. They're scared, confused and angry at their situation. They're not clichés. My only concern was how the backstory was intertwined with the main plot. I feel the pace was slowed down every time there was an expositional backstory. Particularly in Mr. Blonde's case, I felt it wasn't necessary for it to be as long (around 8 full minutes to tell us how his relationship with Nice Guy Eddie and Joe Cabot. Aside from that, the movie keeps you wanting to know what happens next every second.",
554,26 April 2004,ALauff,8, Sterling Debut,"Quentin Tarantino's crime thriller about an anonymous group of low-end hoods and how they deal with a diamond heist gone terribly awry still stands out as a coruscating debut, with its elliptical, jump-cutting narrative construction illuminating a vision of antisocial individuals unwittingly confined to a hell of their own making. The cavernous warehouse, a windowless, stifling structure, is where the characters eventually ""end up"" after a bungled heist and where the fulcrum of this tense, sweaty battle of wills plays out. The moral linchpin of the story is the relationship between Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), an undercover cop whose unnerving, gut-wounded shrieks open the movie proper. A tough, grizzled veteran, White blasts through police cars filled with cops, while paradoxically nurturing the incognito Orange back to health, holding his head in his lap, assuring him in a sing-song voice: ""You're not gonn-aa dii-eee.""

567,18 February 2001,~PL~,10, A very strong gangster film...,"Reservoir Dogs is Tarantino's best, in my opinion, even though I know many people will contest this affirmation...Pulp Fiction was pretentious, had a style that looked a little too ""wannabe"", and that didn't fit with that kind of story.  But Reservoir Dogs is different.  With all its awesome acting, especially from Harvey Keitel, its excellent twists and non conventional situations, it's the best film of its kind.  It's boosted with testosterone, but it also laughs at itself, just to show how badly some supposedly professionals can work.  No humor, no jokes in this film, it's just the troubling situations some characters confront that will make you laugh.  And that's perfect, because the humor in Pulp Fiction was there to seem cool. The scenario is pretty well written, even though the use of the F-word is excessive...that story reminds me some Shakespeare texts, without all the pathetic and sad perspective.  (Spoilers warning) There's also that scene, where Mr.Blue cuts off the cop's ear...this is a classic in violent cinema (is this a good or bad thing?!?!) because of its intensity, and of course, realism.  The whole thing is very violent, and I don't know how a man that got shot once in the torso can bleed over half of a garage's floor...the awesome ending is also one of the most brutal and weird ones you can see. The story is about a group of robbers who plan a robbery at a jewelry, and that fail it...but the problem is that the cops were already in front of the store even before the robbery...so the criminals suspect one of them for being a cop.  And the relationships between the several characters seperate them in two different groups, confronting each other in the end.  And when you realize that the whole film was about seeing these guys fail, and kill each other to arrive at the conclusion that everyone is dead, the only thing you can do is laugh out loud...because it is funny, in some way.  And the Coconut song won't help you stop laughing, because it brings an ironic and satiric aspect to it.  The tagline used for ""Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels"" which is ""A DISGRACE TO ALL CRIMINALS"" is more compatible with this one...and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a pretty good movie too. Overall, great acting, interesting and surprising story twists, fine directing, and a very good movie. 9/10",

First off a lot of people say that this movie is too bloody and too gorey. Not so. Yes there is blood and gore, but its not in excess like a lot of people think. You mention this movie and sometimes all people say is how bloody it is. This movie tells an incredible story of when the perfect plan goes bad and you dont know who you can trust. Michael Madson plays, in my opinion, one of the most sadistic characters ever. He is so arrogant, sarcastic, demented and crazy that you can't help but love him....Hence the ear scene. It's great that now people are starting to really discover this movie. It took 10 years, but hell you will not be disappointed. The acting, story, suspense, humor and twists make this movie a masterpiece. Check out the new 10th anniversary DVD set to get the real scoop on this movie. Get your fave character as the cover. It has some great behind the scenes stuff including a full view of the ear scene. This and Pulp Fiction are my favorite movies. Jackie Brown was okay, but a little to dragging for me.

Just a brutal, bloody, cruel, sadistic picture, it's beyond me what kind of people enjoy this.

While I thought his subsequent movie, ""Pulp Fiction"" was quite good, I wish he followed the timeline as the events occurred.  Sometimes it is necessary to jump around in time from scene to scene.  In this movie, it was unnecessary.  He could have easily started from the beginning and shown the movie in the order the events occurred.  The average moviegoer would not like this movie and would be more appealing to the avante garde film buff. While this movie is certainly original, that does not make it good.  The plot was difficult to follow and had minimal enjoyable moments.  While some of the scenes were intense, it is definitely not a feel good movie.",

Reservoir Dogs is the proof that if you actually have a vision and if you put pasion in your what you're doing you will succed.

It turns out so-and-so was the cop all along and it's quite ironic. It was a nice little idea, cute even; but it's not enough to found an entire movie. In instances such as these, dialogue must be employed to fill the void. There were a few nice quote, such as, ""If you ever dream about killing me you better apologize in the morning,"" but not enough. Moreso, with a lack of plot and dialogue - I mean good plot and good dialogue ofcourse - unique characters are a last option to save a movie. Maybe it's because of the already saturated american mafia movie genre, but I was never really connected with any of the characters. (Although Buschemi was good, but he is always good) Without any viable options, I'm afraid the Terrentino option was employed: If you don't have a movie with a doable plot, play the movie in backwards segments and hope nobody notices.",

However, 20 minutes into the movie you will find yourself glued to the television. Being Tarantino's first film, it's not his best but it is still excellent! It operates how you would expect a Tarantino film to do so - in a seemingly unclear, incredibly violent and dialogue-driven manner. However, just like most of his other films, the plot soon becomes evident as the action shifts between characters and time (yes, the film is not sequential, so this may not be the film for you if you have a tough time following these types of movies). If you enjoy movies that really make you think and question some things you believe, especially reality, then this is the movie for you! Tarantino presents a gripping plot that is as real as it gets - this is not your typical Hollywood-ruined crime film. This is reality (or at least, Tarantino's reality).",
595,7 October 2005,bulleetz37235,9, A film of genuine quality...,"Reservoir dogs epitomises the stark violence that Tarantino was known for. His first outing as a director is the best other than the miraculous Pulp Fiction, but face it that is one of the best films EVER made. For the most part the film is set in an abandoned warehouse, where a motley crew of criminals dwell over the aftermath of a jewellery store heist gone wrong... With fantastic performances from the ensemble cast of Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Tim Roth, Tarantino himself, the late Lawrence Tierney and of course Michael Madsen in a career defining role form the colour coded gang who are furious at each other as they discover there is a rat in their midst who has set them all up. But who? Of course we know, and it is quite ironic to see Mr White defending him oblivious to who he is. This creates a great elevated level of tension as you watch him biting everyones head off who suggests that he Mr Orange is the rat. Brilliant. The story is told in typical jigsaw fashion, and it lets you know how the crew came together. The ending is a very tense affair as the cops close in and the so-called professionals turn on each other. The dialogue is fantastic, great examples include. "" Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie. Or are you gonna bite?"" and "" was that as good for you as it was for me?"" These are pretty memorable, especially the latter which is said after one of the most notorious movie scenes ever, which is when Mr Blonde cuts off his poor hostage, Marvin Dash's ear... gory. But still one of the best ever scenes in film history. Sure these are great and memorable, but the film undoubtedly owes a lot to older films, in particular I think it owes a lot to The Asphalt Jungle. But I think Tarantino has created a masterful piece of film, with slick direction, brilliant dialogue and an exceptionally told story, I think this film will definitely go down in history. As it says... every dog has its day, this will have many.",

This is a rare film indeed where the quality is in the feel and the atmosphere created by the people involved who have created a film where as one reviewer for this film puts it 'less is more'. In my opinion all of the actors have to be in a certain frame of mind for a film like this to work and the result could so easily been comical if one or more of its parts had been faulty. That automatically means that the man directing this film is a risk taker and probably an innovative and intelligent film maker. I know nothing about Quentin Tarantino other than seeing him in From Dusk till Dawn which I also enjoyed. Apparently he is only 46 and he will no doubt keep producing films of this quality, well at least I hope he does. I would recommend anyone watch this film, yes it is a violent and bloody film but there is a lot more to it than just those two aspects.

That wasn't the case with Quentin Tarantino. Reservoir Dogs is filled with all the tropes we now view as standard procedure for him, and it's honestly astonishing how he managed to create such an original and unique directing style for his very first movie. Almost the entire runtime of the movie is just dialogue, which would be boring had any other filmmaker made it, but Tarantino manages to make it interesting, suspenseful, funny and relaxed at the same time, his greatest strength in my opinion. The characters are full of personality and very interesting, the music choices are great, the plot is done really well. I do have a few issues though. The first is the fact that I didn't get much enjoyment of the environments, which were bland and boring to look at. I also think the movie is a little short, and it ends rather abruptly. Overall though, this is a great, fun, entertaining movie from one of the greatest directors of his generation.",

Quentin Tarantino deserves the up most credit for this masterpiece as does Harvel Keitel, who leads an extremely strong and professional cast. An unuusual way to set the film in the form of it's timing, as the audience straight away is thrown into the drama from the off but it works beautifully & has the desired effect which Tarantino creates time and time again throughout the movie.

Whether it'll be a great career whose legacy will live on forever, or a frightening one that will give the industry a bad name, the debut can give us an idea of what we can expect from a newcomer. The former definitely applies to Reservoir Dogs. Made by a film geek with a tiny budget and a stellar cast, the film became a staple, not only of the independent cinema scene, but of the entire film industry in general.

The dialogue is masterful and while camera shots typically establishes a film's strength, the dialogue serves as this vehicle's steering wheel. Despite the incredible dialogue, the cinematography doesn't take a backseat. The camera shots elicit the film's thrill, presenting the viewer with scenes that will undoubtedly stick with them post viewing. The script is incredibly written, exhibiting Tarantino's masterful manner of holding the viewer's attention and keeping them engaged despite time jumps. The time jumps and pacing compliment each other and are cohesive throughout the entire film. The film wastes no time getting to the point and answering the viewers questions. The acting in this film is incredible. This cast is filled with incredible leading men who carry on as if they've known each other their entire lives.

Unlike most people I prefer this film to Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino's follow-up to Reservoir Dogs. The story line is fairly simple with a group of criminals who know nothing about each other meeting in a warehouse after a jewel heist turns violent. The criminals are the calm veteran played by Harvey Keitel (Copland, Bugsy), the dying young criminal played by Tim Roth (Rob Roy, Hoodlum), the sadistic but calm man played by Michael Madsen (Donnie Brasco, Free Willy), and the jumpy nervous guy played by Steve Buscemi (Desperado, Con Air).  They are waiting for their boss well-played by Lawrence Tierney (Dillinger, Born to Kill) and his son played by Chris Penn (Deceiver, Rush Hour).  As they wait what little trust there was disappears as they suspect that one of them is a rat leading to violent conflicts.  There are several tough scenes to watch, especially a torture scene.  The film however is very well-written and amazingly acted.  Keitel, Roth, Penn, and Buscemi are all excellent.  The film's best performance belongs to one of my favorite actors, Michael Madsen.  Madsen delivers an unforgettable and chilling take on his sadistic character.",

The assigning of the code names... Oh, and of course, an officer's torture (courtesy of Blonde and a razor) to the tune of ""Stuck in the Middle With You."" The list goes on and on, but I wouldn't dare spoil the many creative twists for anybody. I will say my favorite scene (or maybe scenes, since it's kind of long and scattered about) is Mr. Orange's memorizing and execution of ""The Camode Story;"" maybe it's the actor in me that relates...

The hatred that is exhibited for police officers is somewhat repulsive. It was actually painful to watch.

626,18 December 2002,brodie6,10, Superb film making at its finest.,This is one of Tarantinos best movies now I do like Pulp Fiction more but this is up there in one of my favorite films to date. There is no point saying how it starts out being that it jumps around a lot that is one thing I love is the inconsistent story. But basically it is a heist film but a heist that went wrong with cops dead civilians dead some of the robbers are dead as well. The names are great they just use colors you never have to worry who is who oh thats Mr. White thats Mr.Pink. When they are getting there names is one of my favorite scenes in the movie. But in a way this movie starts as a mystery of who is the cop granted it tells you half way through and you can figure it out real quick but the characters are so good at fighting one another on who betrayed them. The soundtrack is one of the best I had to get the song Little Green Bag the theme of Reservoir Dogs because it was just so cool. The writing and acting is phenomenal there isn't a dull moment where you are thinking please move along I want this to be done. The ending wasn't the best ending but that is a minor complaint to this epic film. In the end buy this on Blu Ray it is just stellar movie for the ages.,

The movie is dark and brutal on its own, he didn't really discover the funny violence yet, the movie is just kind of... disturbing. Sort of.

That would be cool, wouldn't it?"" That would be cool, but it would take the Coen brothers and John Goodman to get that shot right. What Tarantino does in Dogs is use a simplistic backdrop to draw head shots of comic book gangsters, like a kid making shadows on the wall in front of a projector after the film runs out. A kid who tortures puppies. The whole film is a bad impression of a good gangster picture. The intimacy of the cinematography draws the audience in; makes us a part of this crew of facile felons. The dialogue leaves you searching for a Q-tip. The one that reminds us of our greedy little selves gets away with the diamonds; the rat, along with everyone else, dies violently. The audience gets one in the gut, too, as the screen fades to black. Tarantino's freshman bark comes out more Taco Bell chihuahua than New Jack City rottwieler.",

Tarantino knows exactly what we want and gives it to us in so many of his films, just like he does in this one. The story (undercover cop ...) has been done so many times, but never it was made like this. How come Tarantino succeeds where others fail? There are lots of reasons, but let me just give you the most important one: the dialogs! They are brilliant brilliant brilliant!!! The movie begins with this one: Mr. Brown's vision on what 'Like a virgin' is all about... geniality! Every word that comes out of Joe, the big boss, is so hilarious! As I'm running out of synonyms for funny etc., I'll stop here. As in all Tarantino's films, the editing is also of a very high level, as is the music, but then again, how could the music possibly be bad: it's K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's!!! You can't but love the DJ. And on top of all that, we have the honor to see a top-cast in action. I'm talking 'bout Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and I also want to mention Lawrence Tierny (Joe), cause he really made me laugh a lot of times.",

Harvey Keitel, Steve Busecemi, Tim Roth, Chris Penn, Quentin Tarantino himself and of course Micheal Madsen. And some of the lines. Are you gonna bark all day little doggie, or are ya gonna bite is a classic. Harvey with a simple yet great line Hardy Effing Har is a nice entry. And Steve Busemci. ""Want a smoke"" says Mr White. ""Nah i quit"" replies Steve. Pauses, ""What you got one"" Steve was good here too on par with with his performance in Fargo. The ending is great too. Everybody dies except for Steve. Jeez, talk about bloodshed. And that poor cop. Ear cut off, emotionally wrecked and eventually shot to death. But that ear cutting is absolutely messed up.

The film is about an old slick crook , Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his fat loud mouth son , Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) who set up a diamond heist. They pick six cons to pull of the job. They refer to each other as colors , they are , Mr. White (Harvey Keital) , Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) , Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) , Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) , Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) and Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino). The film takes place after the robbery , when they plan to meet at an old abandoned warehouse. Well all hell breaks loose! One of them is killed , one of them is wounded and one of them is missing. They start discussing what went wrong and why the cops were there waiting for them. They come to the conclusion... That one of them is working with the L.A.P.D! A great movie for crime fans as well as others. The movie is entertaining throughout and is true to life. Two years later Quentin Tarantino made a great follow-up film about hitmen , diner bandits , drug dealers , junkies and a boxer living violent lifes in L.A.

I'm still not a fan of his work but I liked this film. I've tried watching Pulp Fiction a couple of times but I could only manage a maximum of 45 minutes into that film...Lets just say Pulp Fiction is not my cup of tea, who knows maybe third time I'll see it completely and then decide for myself. So before watching this film I was a little skeptical about the quality of the film-making from Tarantino. As it turned out he did a very good job. I was pleased with the movie and I believe it was never off-track. Probably the best thing other than the plot and the characters was the casting. Kudos to the man behind the casting he was almost spot-on. Now that brings me to the point where I felt a little let down. Chris Penn as ""Nice Guy Eddie"" was a DOUCHE BAG. I absolutely hated his acting especially during the Mexican Standoff scene when he yelled at Mr.White and while asking Mr.Orange for the answers{Chris was trying to bulge his eyes out}...That looked damn Phony and unrealistic. That scene really bothered me. The other not so good thing about the movie IMO was its profanity{especially the ear-cutting scene...it was gross}. Everything else was very good.",

I really liked everyone but Steve Buscemi,Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel just steals the show. This movie starts the style of Tarantino's long conversation about pop culture,daily and criminal activities which people enjoys till now.

This is no doubt Tarantino's worst film, and it highlights all of his shortcomings as a screenwriter. I rewatched this thing because I remember some bong choked stoners telling me 'how awesome it is' at University. Rewatched it, and wow! Like wow, I had already grown out of my Tarantino phase and I think he's a remarkable filmmaker, 'Pulp Fiction' is one of the more creative movies of the 90's. But MAN DOES THIS SUCK. This is a derivative, trope saturated nightmare. Why does Mr. White have such an overly paternal attitude to an undercover cop who he met mere weeks, to the extent that he's pointing a gun at guys who the film displayed earlier having equally warm interactions with him, but instead of knowing him for weeks like Orange, he's know them for decades, yet he.

Also, it uses a radio like it were an actual radio (in the ""stuck in the middle with you"" scene, it's noticable when you watch the movie). As far as I'm concerned those two things alone would be enough reason to see it, but, there are even more reasons to see it, just ask anybody who's seen it.

I wish I had turned it off as soon as he opened his mouth. However, my curiosity got the best of me, and I had to see where the movie ended up.

This is only good because it has forced QT to focus on the story and the relationships and not to some gimmicks like the three separate stories in Pulp Fiction or the huge battle scenes in Kill Bill vol. 1 (not to say of course that these movies aren't great too). Small cast and a simple setting in an abandoned warehouse bring the best up. Keitel and Roth are great and Madsen and Buscemi have the best roles in their whole career.

667,19 December 2017,vladgroovy,10, Best Tarantino movie,"After finally watching Reservoir Dogs twice, I can definitely say that this is near the top of my Tarantino movie list (with all of his other movies). This man is an absolute genius. Armed with just $1.2 million, Quentin Tarantino is able to provide a movie that has it all. A clever, mind bending story, compelling characters, and even an exceptional soundtrack. All of this in his first movie! Despite how simple the story may sound on the surface, Reservoir Dogs takes a big left turn when it decides to make one of the men an undercover cop. It is then left up to the viewer to decide who the ""Rat"" is. Tarantino's decision to include a ""Rat"" adds an element of mystery that keeps the viewer engaged throughout the whole movie. However, where Reservoir Dogs really shines is with its characters. 4 of the 6 men are given such vibrant personalities that it not only makes them entertaining character, but it also helps make each one of the characters a plausible choice to be the ""Rat"". The nonlinear storyline also works great in the film as it provides back-story in a way that coincides well with what is happening in the main plot. The hiccups Reservoir Dogs suffers from is a couple of awkward moments in the dialogue. However, Tarantino was able to show in his future films that he is fully capable of delivering spot on dialogue. Overall Reservoir Dogs is what you would expect from Quentin Tarantino. Over the top violence, profanity, and characters that all work great together. Quentin Tarantino has done it again!!!!",

The end was quite fantastic but I would have loved if Freddy was not caught. But still the movie is directed in a unique manner and really it needs gut to make movie about heist without showing the heist. The acting I would say was top-class, all the characters were in their character till the last. It felt perfect for the movie, even the dialogues as expected were top notch.

After that, I'm now in a position where I think that violence and profanity are VERY essential elements. This movie changed the way I write my own movies. My characters talk like these guys do. And I show violence in the same manner. My movie is an action film entitled ""Hard Job."" Look out for it in the future. All the actors are great! My favorites are Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen. The torture scene, that was so outrageous. I now have a new view towards bad guys. I think all bad guys should be like Mr. Blonde. I liked every part of this movie. (Not when innocent people were killed. I thought those scenes were strong, but that's what happened in the story.)

Keitel is in top form, and Steve Buscemi has a break out role as ""Mr. Pink"" that really put him on the map. But the actor who steals the movie is Michael Madsen. There aren't enough adjectives (positive ones) for this movie, but I would call this as ""raw"" as a movie can get. The violence is personal, at gut level, and you'll never feel the same way about a certain song. You'll see. If you haven't seen this movie, don't just rent it, go out and buy it. You'll be glad you did.",
686,4 December 2002,wmattifo,10, A Masterpiece of raw violence,"This is QT's second best film out of the 2 great films he made, so far, right behind Kill Bill. The story is great, and told in a creative and intriguing way, first you see the crew relaxing, telling jokes, about to commit the job, then you see Mr Orange bloody in the back of a car, opening a whole chest of questions (soon to be answered), then you see Mr White and Mr Pink trying to figure out what went wrong, then you learn about the characters while slowing piecing together how the job got messed up, until finally the truth comes out, and the ends meet. Now this screenplay was worth an Oscar, not Pulp Fiction (not a bad film, but not a very good one either, and entirely overrated) which had a simple story, and wasn't very interesting or entertaining. The acting in this is believable and good, the story is masterfully handled, its funny, its sad, its entertaining, and is easily the best heist movie, even though you never really see the heist (which could have made it alittle better, especially to see how crazy Blonde got, it could have helped the overall movie). I hope QT still has some tricks left for his future projects, because he certainly didn't have any for Pulp or Jackie, and i hope he didn't use them all on this and Kill Bill. 8 out of a 10.",

The story seems very simple however it is several layers deep it all revolves around the aftermath of a bungled robbery where 6 men total strangers to each other except the father and son who organised the caper the robbers are given aliases on the job and are told not to tell each other their Christian names. After the disastrous robbery which leaves two of the robbers dead, one badly wounded and the other driving around with a cop in his trunk, Mr White(Harvey Keitel) Mr Blonde(Michael Madsen) Mr Pink(Steve Buscemi) Mr Blue(Eddie Bunker) Mr Brown(Quentin Tarantino) Nice Guy Eddie(Chris Penn) Mr Orange(Tim Roth) and Joe Cabot(Lawrence Tierney) can't believe it when one of them turns out to be a double crosser even taking a regular cop whose hiding a big secret Marvin Nash(Kirk Baltz) doesn't answer the question..who is the rat???. I wont spoil the big secret all i can do is praise the brilliant film the acting is top class some of the best i have ever seen especially Harvey Keitel who should have won an Oscar for his performance however all of the other actors turn in the performance of their careers, the script is one of the best i have ever seen with some of the best one liners and comments i have ever heard GET OUT THERE AND SEE IT.....NOW",
689,25 December 2006,the_stiff_meister,10, One of the 10 Best Movies ever made !!,"'Reservoir Dogs' more than likely refers to a pack of mean, killing, blood-thirsty dogs reuniting at a warehouse after what seemed to be a well thought out heist went terribly wrong. It truly is a very original plot, and unique in its ways relating to violence and the psychos that perform this violence, as if it is routine. The acting is marvelous, especially Tim Roth's who must portray a dying member of the crew of criminals involved in this failed heist. Tarantino's dialog is completely realistic and memorable in a way that you would honestly think that real guys sitting around a table in a coffee shop would say. QT's directional debut is flawless. Lower-budget crime films like these don't get any better than 'Reservoir Dogs', for it is a great all around film, with great action 'shots', and dramatic conflicts. With all of these characteristics that go along with the realistic dialog, it is as if this movie plot really happened, and you are watching it take place, and if the viewer feels like that, then this film is a must-see.

Everyone always talks about how its such a classic, and how ""Tarantino is the voice of our generation"". The plot is about a bunch of thieves with code names who are trying to rob a bank, and one of the crew happens to be a cop. In usual Tarantino fashion, he dices the film up into different parts - first is the end, and so on. He cuts it up so you don't actually see the robbery. Really annoying. The script is constant swearing. Really nothing more. The cast leaves some to be desired. Michael Madsen makes me want to hit myself in the face constantly. The ear cutting scene was a letdown. Tarantino can't act, he should of stayed behind the camera. Pulp fiction had a slightly better cast (Willis, Jackson, Travolta), but an equally horrible script. This movie looks like it was made on virtually no money. There are only 3 major sets, and a few other places on the movie. A giant warehouse were a good chunk of the movie is spent, along with the diner, and a car. In the end, I was not impressed.

It must have been really exciting to see, in 1992, this new wonderful kind of filmmaking arise. The great thing about his movies is that they're always so fresh, so authentic. I've heard some people say he does nothing but plagiarize from the classics, I couldn't disagree more. Besides paying homage to his favorite movies and directors, he ends up subverting whatever contemporary notions we may have of movie-making, and creating something new out of it.

It manages a balance between a detective story to find out who ratted the team out, an aftermath story of finding out who did what and what happened, a crime story with conflicting characters and a heist movie where villains (robbers) organize a heist. This film is an exciting story of betrayal and of humane trust and sadistic violence. Quentin Tarantino weaves a web of stories together to make pragmatic characters and situation where the viewer struggles with the moral choice of right and wrong. Of course, the choice is all in the audiences head where they root for morally flawed characters that are all acted with gusto by their respective actors. This story is the simplest that Tarantino has brought to screen but I enjoyed every second of its minimalist structure as it permits the viewing to become much more personal.",

This movie is a kind of lesson of making a movie. There must be dialogues, screenplay, actors, director, music. The movie begins with dialogues came directly from a Sacha Guitry's screenplay; Who had seen ""Like a virgin"" like a pornocrat ? Who had really reasons not to give a tip ? You got them. The story is well-built, with those flashbacks and ""coups de theatre"". Sending few guys in outer space can't make a screeplay. The actors are all perfect. Tim Roth shows that he can play every kind of role (Joshua Shapira, Van Gogh, Pumpkin, Charles Ferry), idem for Harvey Keitel who plays in every kind of film, for every generation (""The piano"", ""From dusk till dawn"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Le regard d'Ulysse""), or Steve Buscemi, the actor with the most eclective filmography (""Con air"", ""Fargo"", ""The real blonde"", ""Armaggedon"", ""The big Lebowski""). Michael Madsen shows that the word of maniac or psycho is very often usurpated. Mr Blonde is the new Norman Bates. Q Tarantino the director always knows where to put the camera, to see the ""little differences"" that make the differences between the different characters. Try to listen to ""Stuck in the middle with you"" without thinking about this scene of torture. When the right song is used at the right scene, the fact is that you can't hear the music without thinking about this scene. Martin Scorsese said that ""Resevoir dogs"" is the film where the music is used by the best way. I think it sounds very good. By using the music this way you can also add ""Halloween"" and ""Sonatine"" (Takeshi Kitano). ""Reservoir dogs"" is a lesson to the new directors who try to make films. Putting music or telling ""f***"" in every sentence is not enough to make a film. This is a message to Michael Bay and Rolland Emmerich.",

Though he is arguably a one-trick pony in some ways, (releasing almost only non-linear crime thrillers with poetic dialog and sadistic violence and gore), it has yet to fail him, and sets him on a winning streak with his first film, Reservoir Dogs. Tarantino takes a sub genre of crime films that is tried and true, the heist flick, but adds new touches to it that glow with his brilliant touch. Most heist flicks involve three distinct acts- The setup, the execution, and the fallout- but Tarantino mixes this up; he throws act two out the window completely, leaving the heist a complete mystery save one thing; we know it went horribly, killing one of the six guys and leaving another missing. Secondly, he switches back and forth from the two remaining acts; in one scene, we're with the three survivors, hearing what went wrong and witnessing the flimsy bonds of loyalty slowly unravel. The next, we see the doomed heist come together, watching the characters talk about their plans and joke with one another. These are some of the best scenes in the movie; Quentin is a master at dialog, giving his characters profane poetry exchange in a Shakesperean fashion. Watching grown men sitting around the table talking about top-40 Maddonna, arguing about tipping or pseudonyms, and describing humorous anecdotes from previous jobs is delightful. It really gives a chance for the actors to shine. Steve Buscemi, my perennial favorite, Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth in particular are incredible, and Chris Penn proves that the acting gene didn't just get passed to Sean.",

766,21 May 2010,Will3451,9, Million times better than the Bollywood copy Kaante (2002),"It's obvious from the opening conversation on reasons why not to tip and the meaning of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' that Reservoir Dogs tries to be different. To begin, it doesn't fit the expected narrative structure. Instead of the usual 10 minute robbery at the end of the movie after various stages of planning, the entire running time is centered around the surrounding hours of the heist - with only flashbacks giving any information of the characters lives before. The dialogue is refreshingly different, often hilarious. Even if there is a heavy reliance on taboo. The film is cool. Very cool (unlike that cliched pause just now). The crooks are smartly dressed in suits and walk down the street to 'Little Green Bag' in what is the most stylish strut in cinema history. Other sophisticated attributes are the aliases given to the crooks, which each resemble a colour instead of revealing their own names. It leaves the impression that they don't trust each other, which they don't. So not surprisingly violence is a key theme. Claret is present in almost every scene. Whether it's Tim Roth losing several pints of blood or Micheal Madsen amputating a cop's ear in a torture session to the tune of 'Stuck in the middle with you' ( a powerful juxtaposition of a feel-good music with stomach-churning knife work) . The acting is generally good, especially from Madsen as the psycho 'Mr Blonde' who has a dominating screen presence in every scene he's in. The only flaw is a rather basic screenplay, which has an over reliance on dialogue. The concept isn't entirely original either, the plot and several scenes are borrowed from the Hong Kong film 'City on Fire' which was released much earlier. Despite this, the film remains an impressive and refreshing debut of a quality seldom encountered.",

In the opening scene they are just talking about unimportant things. Also Mr. Orange and Mr. White have a strong friendship. Mr. White takes a bullet and kills 2 of his friends to protect Mr. Orange.

771,4 July 2020,casstevens-43612,5, I was extremely bored and dissapointed,"Tarantino's best and most inspired work. I was unprepared for the pure impact of this movie, although the opening diner-table dialogue between all members of the cast marked it immediately as a Tarantino film. No one shows us that ""crooks are people too"" the way he does, yet he will follow with scenes of such crushing brutality that we once again remember the differences between the good guys and the bad guys. His colorful characters- Mr. White (with the ""cool-sounding name), Mr. Orange, psychotic Mr. Blonde, and feisty Mr. Pink interact with a variety of personality clashes that produce some outstanding scenes. No one character is the star, they all play tug-o-war for our attention. A lack of musical score lends a gritty, realistic, ""Cops""-like feel to the interspersed action sequences- quite unusual, and a welcome change from the orchestral bombardment present in other movies during shootouts, car chases, etc. The crime that is the center of the plot is never shown, therefore the viewer uses his or her imagination and stories from each individual character as they tell it to piece together what took place in the jewelry store. Quite a lot of blood flows in the course of the movie, but it is never gratuitous nor glorified. Oscar-worthy performances abound, most especially from greviously wounded Tim Roth and nervously intense Steve Buscemi. Some wonderful twists and a stunning ending make this movie what is sure to be known as one of the classics of the 1990's.",

786,18 October 1999,Benaiah,10, Created it's own genre...,"Talk about violence. This film has plenty of it. Most of the killing in Reservoir Dogs can be easily avoided but isn't. The male ego takes over here as all of the characters have their own hidden agenda. For example: Mr. White: Save Mr. Orange. Mr. Blonde: Kill as many people as possible. Mr. Orange: Not bleed to death. The only one of the thieves who doesn't really have an agenda except survive is Mr. Pink, the only character who is professional. As history has taught us, people are willing to die for things that they believe in. The things they believe in may be void or completely irrelevant to the mission at hand. The film is more of a satire than anything, of this nature because everything that happens in terms of tragedy was avoidable as easy as looking in the other direction and dropping these agendas for something more important. Quentin Tarantino makes movies that are a landmark to modern day cinema. With all this death, it appears the main reason he made it was to kill people. The way the characters talk is as if they were actual people in a conversation. I laugh at many of the jokes they tell. I like the suits they wear as well as the story-line because it never really shows the robbery, and as we learn throughout the movie, the chaos in the store may have in fact been more intense than originally thought. I can't wait to buy the action figures, especially the Marvin Nash torture play-set with the removable ear. That brings me to the movies most controversial scene: Stuck In The Middle With You. The most chilling person in this movie is Mr. Blonde played masterfully as Michael Madsen. The scene with him and the cop is disturbing and at the same time politically incorrect (You don't torture people for fun). An obvious versatile actor, Michael Madsen went from this movie to Free Willy. Wow, his career really soared. One minute he's mass murdering a jewelry store. The next he's freeing willy.",

The film has received many great reviews (IMDB=8.4 / Rotten Tomatoes=8.8) such as Empire magazine calling it the ""Greatest Independent Film ever made"".

They're out on a job, robbing jewels and the like, when something goes wrong. It's set mainly in an empty warehouse, with 4 of the nameless criminals: Mr White, Blonde, Pink and Orange and a poor kidnapped policeman. As you will expect from a Tarantino film, it has a lot of shooting, a lot of blood and a lot of dead people. However, this shouldn't put you off. As it is only a mere 95 minutes long, it won't take up too of your day and will keep you adequately entertained. Right from the start you know it is not going to be your usual crime- thriller. Tarantino's unique direction and clever dialogue prevent this film from being forgotten once you've seen it, it will probably persuade you to give it another watch. There are some excellent performances by Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitl, Chris Penn and Tim Roth. A small part, of course, was saved for Quentin Tarantino himself. Being Tarantino's first film; it is very impressive and definitely paves the way for his future successes..Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill. There is only one thing I'm going to be critical about: the discovering of who is the undercover policeman came about too soon for my liking; it could have easily been drawn out a bit longer. However, this didn't mean I wanted to stop watching once I knew. There was still a lot more to keep me wanting to watch. The flash backs in the film gave it more depth, and saved it from being a typical linear narrative. The funny opening scene where Buscemi ""doesn't believe in tipping"" could be one of my favourites and instantly reminded me of the bar scene in Desperado, where he tells the story of a man urinating all over a bar and the barman being pleased about it.

The general plot may be unoriginal but who cares when you can listen to how a bunch of daunt men discuss the meaning behind ""Like a Virgin"", how Mr. Orange retells the story of a weed, police and a toilet or how Mr. Pink haggles for another nickname. It is not even important to the plot but, well, it is *more* important than the plot. If you like Tarantino works have no doubts about this one. And if you haven't seen a single Tarantino movie... expect it to be different from what you commonly see.",
802,19 July 2019,ziggystardust-88692,8, The foundation of Quentin Tarantino,Awesome movie. Such a sleek and stylish build of characters in an intense supercharged plot of a bank heist gone horribly wrong. And the detail of what happens to each member and how their distrust of each other spirals out of control is edge-of-your-seat terrific! Full of classic Taratino lines. Although the only problem with the film is that Tarantino is in it and at the beginning gives one of his typical self indulgent idiotic monologues Once you get past that the movie is a gem! Better than Pulp Fiction at times.,

805,10 July 2003,Mr_Blonde3,10," Flawless cinema, and Mr. Blonde rules.",As Quentin Tarantino's first film this one truly sets the hallmarks for the director which would be used in his later films. The movie is about six criminals who work together to rob a bank but their employer attempts to keep it professional. They all dress in suits and never use their real names so as to keep their real identities hidden. Interestingly the film completely revolves around the robbery but it is never actually shown with the entire movie jumping back and forth from before and after the robbery. It shows how the different men got hired on for the job and how they react to the robbery going completely wrong. Most of the group believes that they were set up so they also must discover which one of them is an undercover cop. So the story is very non-linear which really keeps it interesting and the movie really makes you keep on guessing about who the undercover cop is which is really good storytelling. So overall an excellent plot that works very well in the film.,

But even better than that was the movie's excellent acting and great cast.  Every role was cast perfectly and acted very well, even Tarantino's bit, and, although Sam Jackson is an excellent actor, I respect and support Mr. Tarantino's decision not to use him in this film. Harvey Keitel was a special treat in this film, as was Steve Buscemi.  The story is in every way perfect and the setting, although very different from that of Pulp Fiction, is every bit as good.  Tim Roth didn't give as good of a performance in this as he did in Pulp Fiction, since he was playing an American in Reservoir Dogs, but he still did a good job.  Michael Madsen did an excellent job in this film, playing his role perfectly (probably just as writer/director Quentin Tarantino originally saw the character in his mind), and it's a shame we didn't see him in another Tarantino flick until Kill Bill Vol. 2.  Reservoir Dogs is second only to Tarantino's own Pulp Fiction, and the opening credits sequence is very cool and clever.  I recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it.

If the movie didn't have any of that, you have bad writing and bad acting, with the only thing keeping the movie on it's feet is Steve Buscemi's performance (and of course a good soundtrack). Pulp Fiction is a much better movie, but that is because it has great humor, and a great script. The characters are sick in Resivoir dogs, and the script is foul. Most of all, screaming and swearing make up most of Pulp Fiction's script, and with that, the only reason why people like this movie, only really lies in the films sick style, which consists of bad language, and ears being sliced of by a razor.",

Tarantino clearly knows how to write dialoges and grips the attention of the viewer, even if they do not want to look at it. The concept is very interesting and leaves the viewer always with less information than the charakters, so the viewer wants to know more. Every detail that is revealed makes the story more interesting. Unfortunatly near the end the scenes fell out of the story and reveal information that had been better unlocked.

But I think Tarantino does it better. The whole approach to the film means it has a very different style to City, in which we know who the cop is right from the start. Reservoir Dogs begins by inspiring empathy with the criminals, which then leads on to the horror of Mr Blonde's actions, and the tragic relationship Mr White and Mr Orange develop. Quite simply, Reservoir Dogs is a very good film, not very complex perhaps, and scratch beneath the surface and you'll find very little substance, but it has a very impressive surface indeed...

There are other aspects that do suffer from the budgets limitations as well, like I would have enjoyed more background on some of the characters and time at the crime scene.

855,5 August 2021,joeycotten,8, An artist's touch,"""Reservoir Dogs"" starts off unlike any other heist movie I've seen: It shows the AFTERMATH of a failed robbery! The plot overall is clever, and of course, the fact that THIS was Tarantino's debut is nothing short of incredible, and he deserves a lot of credit. Let's focus on the characters: Each character had some kind of role and play their roles EXCELLENTLY, might I add. The best performance, as you might already know, is Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen). The main reason I LOVED this character is because of the classic ear-cutting scene, where he tortures the police officer. Of course, I nearly turned the film off after seeing something that DISTURBING, but now I appreciate it more; not only because Madsen's performance is excellent! It introduced me to more dark scenes in other dark movies (a la Psycho's shower scene). Probably the most incredible thing about this movie is the lack of seeing the actual robbery itself! It only shows before and after and gets talked about between the characters, but we don't actually get to experience it! That's an example of Tarantino's clever directing skills! And I cannot go on without mentioning that ENDING. Do you know what a Mexican standoff is? And have you seen a good amount of westerns? If so, Imagine that but in a secret warehouse. The surprising ending still left mixed feelings with me (Why didn't they show the aftermath of what happened? Did anyone go to prison?!), but overall, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is one of the finest movies of the 90's and also, of course, Tarantino's career. Impressive, impressive debut, indeed!",

864,12 September 2018,Zanchin33,10, The Best Crime Film of All Time,"This is Tarantino`s first movie as a director. I can just say that he did a great job! We see many good actors, examples are: Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn and my favorite actor: Steve Buscemi. I would say that his performance in ""Reservoir dogs"" is his best ever. He plays the role of a paranoid, big mouthed and cynical gangster. Harvey Keitel plays the role of an more calm, experienced and ""caring"" type of gangster. I would say that the rest of the actors did a great job too.   ",
865,4 September 1999,Weezer-16,10, Just great!,"The thing to pay attention to when you watch ""Reservoir Dogs"" is the relationship that develops between some of the different characters. A scene that I took great interest in while viewing this for the second time was the scene where Mr. White and Mr. Pink are discussing the events that took place that afternoon. Mr. White is combing his hair when Mr. Pink cocks his gun; Mr. White quickly turns toward Mr. Pink in panic. This event illustrates the mistrust between the characters. A scene that created somewhat of a hole in the movie was the scene when Mr. White pulls out his guns and lights up the two unsuspecting cops. In an actual undercover assignment there's no way that a cop in Mr. Orange's position would allow two police officers to be murdered. Now the rationale behind this event is that there is an existing bond of friendship between Mr. White and Mr. Orange, but Quentin Tarantino needed to show the viewer more information to this effect. I hate to criticize such a wonderful, brilliant film but I believe that aspect of the film sticks out like a sore thumb. People who write this film off as repulsive trash are merely two-dimensional thinkers and are afraid to deviate from their sheltered lives. Very good effort by Quentin Tarantino. Many aspects of this film (i.e. out of sequence events) were mastered in ""Pulp Fiction."" But Pulp Fiction lacks one thing that Reservoir Dogs thrives on: Bravado.",

875,28 April 2002,Douglas McTague,8, Not as good as i was told,"Going into the film, I expected the accoutrement Tarantino films generally set forth: witty dialog, violence, a relatively memorable story, pop culture references, and character acting that supersedes most films. Very early on, I was kind of taken aback at how obvious some of these elements were being presented. The Tarantino dialog felt a step beyond intentional. It was kind of thrown at you bare and didn't have some of the context that his other films had. It was amateurish compared to the more cohesive dialog of Pulp Fiction for example. Tarantino's craft of dialog seems not fully matured here and is in some ways used to prop up weak scenes rather than be a subtle manifestation of the scene. Obviously, there's something very hypnotic about the dialog regardless, and its wit does a good job of distracting you from some of the surrounding vapidity. In terms of characters and acting, I was overall impressed for the most part. I was originally concerned that the concept did not allow much diversity of personality between the characters, but there was a surprising amount of distinctiveness. Actors Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Chris Penn give very convincing performances in particular. I was disappointed at the performance by Harvey Keitel at points, particularly the final shootout. Standards by supporting actors had really raised the bar, and he couldn't completely keep up with the surrounding talent's emotional performances. I think the thorn in the film's side is the restrictive story. It is too traditional to accompany some of the nuances that Tarantino brings to the screen. The non-linear storytelling, while it fits and improves the film, serves better in less restrictive timelines. As mentioned earlier, the story doesn't produce a great diversity in characters. The traditional nature of the story makes pop culture references a little more forced, but I will say that the portrayal of action violence in this film is very natural to the developing scenes. All in all, a very well made and unique take on the heist film, but perhaps not the best palette to work with, as some film elements being not fully realized in this.",

It is hard to believe this is his first movie: an argument can be made that it is still his best. The casting is excellent: Lawrence Tierney as the mob boss, Madsen as the psycho, Keitel as the career criminal (who wants to get tacos after casing the jewel heist). This film gets better with repeated viewing. High-priced talent would not have made this a better movie, in fact movie stars probably would have diminished its brilliance. (Tarantino's casting acumen is also evident in 'Jackie Brown'). The story is told episodically, delving into each character's connection to this heist.

No one actor breaks away from the pack in this film since it seems their natural banter and characterization are united. It is an ensemble piece sort of ""The Big Chill"" on crack.  Yet every aspect is filled with whimsy and genius.  Tarantino's blatant disregard for feelings and the faint are exhibited through many a grotesque torture and shoot out scenes.

919,18 November 2004,luke-pauli1,10, What a film!!!,"First, The movie is perfect for me and I had like it.
second, in my view at first of movie everything is vague and you just see group of guys that sitting around the coffee table and have a conversation together, at that time the movie trying to introduce the characters, after that immediately the robbery has begin but the thing that I interested about movie is the way how to exhibit the story, certainly everything it's imprecise, whatever the movie Going forward the story have becoming clear, of course it's proficiency of writer and director.
third, the other point in this movie is that there is a traitor between the gangsters that make you follow the movie enthusiastically.
in short the story and movie has great for me but soundtrack is pretty regular.",
920,2 September 2019,tayebmahmoodir,7, The great movie of Quentin Tarantino as a first direction,"The first time you see this movie you're probably disgusted by the unnecessary violence in the ""ear"" scene. Only later you realize that Tarantino had you cornered. The movie had such an emotional effect on you that you couldn't cope with your feelings anymore and the only way out is say it's stupid and unnecessary. Especially with inexperienced viewers you strongly notice this effect and it's fun to watch them. I think reservoirs dogs is brilliant. The violence gives you an experience that only horror movies could give you when you were young. This is a real ride! Of course the other brilliance is found in the the dialogues. Forget the cool movie talk,this is how real gangsters talk. And reality proves to be way cooler than fiction!",
921,16 June 2000,Dirk-15,9, Reality is cooler than fiction,Reservior Dogs is Quentin Tarantino's best movie.  The way the movie just keeps flowing makes it great.  The dialog which is Quentin's strong point is great.  It even had me fooled when I found out who was the cop.  This movie is a masterpiece and goes into my best movie list.  I gave this movie a 10. Because its almost at the top of my list.,
922,13 July 1999,JediLazy,10, One of my personal favorites,"When I saw this movie, I thought, man, Tarantino is a genius. Everything is perfect, the sequence, the performance, the direction, the shots. Everything putting in a magnificent way only did it by Tarantino. With this movie boons a legend of the modern filming. Also Tarantino makes a very good and everything but shine performing with Mr. Brown, also Michael Madsen, in the best performance that I ever saw him, Harvey Keitel like always him, excellent and anothers greats performances from Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi or Chris Penn greats actors that unfortunately didn't have the success that they deserves, but always doing they job excellent. One thing that I like most it's the soundtrack, mostly death songs that rises again with extreme beauty in the perfect moments. Like ""Stuck in the middle with you"" from Stealer's Wheels in the scene when Mr. Blonde cuts offs the cop's ears. Excellent, no better choice. Based in another excellent film ""The Killing"" from Kubrick Reservoir Dogs is a master piece that any movie fan should see. For me it is the best picture of Tarantino, even better that Pulp Fiction, that it's also an supreme movie, that gave to Tarantino the Golden Palm in Cannes.",

I am still amazed at the myriad of details behind the making of the film. Originally slated to be a $35,000 movie (profits earned from Tarrantino's sold screenplays-""Natural Born Killers"" & ""True Romance""), it was given a shot in the arm by Harvey Keitel, who somehow managed to get a peek at it. he liked the script so much, that he helped raise the $400,000 budget (while taking a huge cut in pay himself). This is a movie with such ENERGY. A film that screams out for repeated viewings. Try it sometime. Watch it over the course of a month, 3 times, and you will see something new every time. There is a layer of details under almost every sentence. *(SPOILER AHEAD!!!)* For instance, at the opening scene, when they're sitting around the table talking. Each individual's character is revealed totally by what they say. Keitel's character conflict's with ""Joe"" (by taking away his book and stubbornly NOT returning it), this is a clue to the end confrontation. Michael Madsen's character seems slightly trigger happy (""should I shoot this guy over here?""). And Steve Buscemi's ""Mr. Pink"", is the only one who strives to stick to his personal creed of professionalism (""I don't tip-I don't believe in it""). Also watch for the ""rat"" amongst the group. He's the guy who tells Joe who wouldn't leave the tip. It only ten minutes into the movie and all of the characters are completely defined and played out like a card hand. But you don't notice this. And even if you do, you don't care, because you're so enthralled with these crazy, colorful guys! Then there's the FINAL shootout, do you really know who shot chris penn's character? DID Mr. Pink get away? What does the orange balloon mean? *(SPOILER FINISHED)* There are a ton of ""hidden"" details and stories behind the characters and motivations that make this movie so rich with life, but this is not the place for them all. If you are interested in more, I urge you to find the literally dozens of well put-together fan sites out there filled with much more than i could ever write here. Also, i have to say, I love the new take on the contemporary mafia. ",

It's got a decent plot and structure with beginning, development and an end. Good storytelling! The point is about trust and friendship, not corpse count or blood litres and therefore it's not measurable with something like 'and he saved the princess and lived happily ever after'. It's about weirdly realistic characters with ups and downs like normal people.",

The characters were cool as i had come to expect after watching pulp fiction, but i would much rather watch pulp fiction again than watch reservoir dogs again, largely because in reservoir dogs not much goes on despite some interestin moments. i think that reservoir dogs doesn't live up to the rep i had been made to feel it would deliver to. The range of scenarios was to simplistic, there was large parts where nothing but waiting for people to arrive happens and the overuse of the word fock to make some men sound hard is annoying. the banter is funny tho. overall the films average to good, definitely worth seeing once so you know what its all about but its def not my favourite film as it lacks the wow factor, scope etc but won me over in terms of style. 6/10. i'd like to think i'm mr blonde.hah, well maybe not",

It was filmed in a gritty, very real style that captured the simplicity perfectly. From Mr. Orange bleeding in a car's backseat to Mr. Blonde chopping a cop's ear off, the film is full of sadistic humor in Tarantino's usual style. Despite some's views on Tarantino's gore factor, I have to say the movie wouldn't have been the same without it. Every detail that appeared on camera was necessary to convey the tale. I must admit, however, that not everyone will enjoy it. For example, friends of mine absolutely hate stories that start in the middle of the events and go back to tell you what happened and they find it confusing even though Reservoir Dogs does a relatively good job of keeping the viewer on track.

They are ambushed by cops at the jewelry store where the heist was going to go down. The only people who know their plan are amongst them. Everyone is trying to find out ""Who done it"" and the only person they are sure about are themselves. Is it the psychopathic murderer, Mr. Blonde? Is it the looking out for himself only, Mr. Pink? Or is it the mysterious Mr. Blue who only has one line and disappears for the rest of the film. The answer will really surprise you.

The movie doesn't actually show any of the heist but establishes a large amount of personality in the characters. A mob boss sets up a simple heist with a small crew. They meet, don't know each other, and don't tell each other their names. The dialogue between the characters sets up how they react to each other. When the heist goes awry they know they have a snitch in the group. They need to figure out who it is and get rid of them. As the cops close in and they have a member down they have to make a decision. The story is gripping without even having to show any of the heist.

Personally, it took me about a month for the movie to fully sink in. It's screenplay is streamlined; optimal, efficient, yet fully effective. The performances from the likes of Buscemi and Roth are of the highest quality. Don't watch this film expecting to see a heist movie. It unfolds into so much more: a character study, mainly. This is easily one of my top 10 screenplays, and definitely my favorite Tarantino work, over his slightly overrated, in my opinion, 1994 work, Pulp Fiction, which arguably was quite nuanced and well executed, but it lacks the simple nuance and smartness of Reservoir Dogs, which is blunt, pure and clever storytelling. I'd recommend this movie to anybody who loves the craft of telling a story, whether it be writing a novel, a song, or a screenplay. Tarantino knows how to do it, and well.",

""Reservoir Dogs"" is an unabashed homage to heist films and Murphy's law: everything can and will go wrong! Oh, but what fun it is watching everything go wrong. Not that this film should be taken lightly, as it is quite disturbing in it's language, gore, and brilliant suggestions of maniacal violence. This film was, in my opinion, a breakout for most of the actors. But two in particular steal the movie: Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink and Michael Madsen as Mr. Blond. Harvey Keitel, of course, is a human tornado and gives a requisite tour de force performance. But by 1992, anyone who knew Keitel's work expects him to be great. It's the actors that were lesser known that really kicked in the door. Not to take anything away from the other performers, but the movie truly belongs to Keitel, Madsen, and Buscemi (Tim Roth has been better, so I won't really mention him). When you do see this movie, or if you already have, don't be fooled into thinking it completely original. I suggest you take a look at an older (and better) Kubrick film ""The Killing"". You'll see the similarities and will get a better film in the long run. But to the film at hand: Reservoir Dogs is brilliant and one of my favorites.",

As I sit here and try to think of something to refute, I realize this movie hits pretty much all the nails on the head with multiple hammers at a time. While the beginning sequence is odd and initially a little confusing in relation to where you're taken next, Tarantino gives you no choice but to suck it up and deal with a truly gruesome scene to open the story, with one of young Tim Roth's most impressive portrayals and performances. In fact, the scene sets the tone nicely, as many of the interactions in this movie end with a really bloody and blunt shot. You'll notice many movies at least pan the lens upward a little in shots of real disturbing violence and simply leave it up to implication, but Tarantino doesn't make normal movies. Steve Buscemi has simply never played a better character, Harvey Keitel holds heavy real estate in the film and proves why he should, and wise guy Chris Penn's portrayal of crime boss son is brilliant and just as tongue and cheek as convincing. But who impresses me most, is slick, calm, collected, Micheal Madsen, who plays the sickest and most shocking SOB I've seen in a movie in a good while. The way they bounce off and around each-other and the themes is what makes the studded casting in Reservoir Dogs truly special, in a company to a flawlessly executed story, taking place only before and after the heist the movie focuses on, showing the emotions and reactions of characters pre crime and post, but never during. A story of desperation and confidence, the witless and the cunning, the greedy and the losers. Reservoir Dogs is THE heist movie, and it's difficult to see another one competing.",

You will enjoy this film if you don't think that everything has to be perfectly realistic (which most people who review on this do)Tarantino starts us off with the unforgettable cafe seen where the team of jewelery thief's are getting ready to go to work, this sense is so perfect because of Tarantino's unbelievable talent in making conversation, the conversation goes from ""like a virgin"" to ""k-billy's super sounds of the 70s weekend"" with humorous and extremely clever dialog in between.

I'd also like to think it's a Movie for everyone, but neither of these claims are anywhere near true. ""Pulp Fiction"" outclasses ""Reservoir Dogs"" in any category you can think of, and, regretfully, most people just can't appreciate the artistic merit of gallons upon gallons of blood. I'd be willing to venture, though, that ""Reservoir Dogs"" is Ground 0 for all things Tarantino. Obviously, it's his first real Film. But with witty dialogue, gruesome violence and insane quotability, pretty much all of Tarantino's trademarks are featured in style here. Say, this movie does everything Tarantino wanted on a constant 8 or 9 out of 10 level. ""Kill Bill"" would find him expanding upon the violence, for example, but at the expense of the quotability? I can think of some fairly iconic scenes from ""Kill Bill"", but quotes? Basically, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is Quentin Tarantino's most consistent Movie. It's not at all graft or bore, it's shocking and hilarious, in turn. It's just very... EFFICIENT. Tarantino's ideas and Tarantino's script and Tarantino's setting (amazingly, largely one room) are all sturdy and reliable. Any actor could deliver the ""Like A Virgin"" monologue, it's just a great piece. Tarantino gives his actors the best possible platforms to shine on, and they deliver in spades.

I honestly feel that this movie would have been so much better if they had merely gone with the impulse. The cinematography is over dramatic, which is something you don't want to do too much in suspense films, it makes them seem fake and cheesy. I felt the action scenes were trying to be entertaining versus plot tools. I applaud Tim Roth, he was a convincing injured soldier, not too stereotypical. I know this would have been a good movie, but it just didn't quite turn out that way.",

The decay of confidence is followed in 6 men following a botched diamond heist, as they begin to question if they have a police informant among them. The film opens already at the warehouse, and never fully retouches on all the events of the robbery except through dialogue. As the small ties holding the group together fray even further, impulsive actions to find the informant lead the thieves to an Mexican style standoff in which all are shot except one man. As a the police informant slowly dying is cradled by his the one man who trusted him, also dying, the informant admits his guilt, as the movie ends with a closeup on his guardian, the sound of a gunshot and police barging into the warehouse. The final admission of guilt shows the compassion the informant felt for the one man who trusted him, and his final ""I'm sorry"" shows how even in the thick of bloodshed and violence, humanity can maintain.",

Reservoir Dogs delivers a tragic, emotional, and sadistic story that plays with your heart the whole way through. Whether it's a mellow conversation in a café, a tortured man's talk with his victim, or a heated flurry of insults and compromises amongst four men pointing guns at each other, every scene has believable dialogs, which Quentin has always been an expert of. The acting blew me away and every character is vibrant in his own personality. Mr. White, the moral fundamentalist, Mr. Pink, the paranoid wise ass, Mr. Blonde, the maniacal tormentor, and many others all bring their own color into the movie. Tarention's sick way of toying with violence has always been my favorite asset of his directing and it definitely come into full bloom in one scene (in which Mr. Blonde cuts off the ear of a cop and prepares to burn him alive while dancing to classical seventies music). His fantastic use of dialog and speech is constantly relevant as well along with the story's complex and fun nature all come together to make a perfect movie!",

His performance as he gleefully mauls and maims the undercover cop is marvellous and you really feel pity for the cop and total revulsion for Mr Blonde. Also his brief exchanges with Mr White is one of the highlights of this movie. Keitel as Mr White fits his role as the senior gangster perfectly. Not a calculating type but a gangster with ethics if there ever is one. Roth performs very well as Mr Orange. He spends a major port of the movie in a pool of blood from the bullet wound to his gut. His performance as he convinces Joe, Eddie and most importantly Mr White of his authenticity as a criminal initially is good. Buscemi also merits a mention for his acting as the self-claimed professional criminal who first figures out that there is an informant among them and wants to flee from the meeting point as soon as possible. Penn is good, paricularly the scene where he argues with Mr Brown about Mr Blonde. Tierney does well as the boss who assembles the crew for the job.

Also, the sequence of events was very cool. I love how Quentin Tarantino uses the "" chapter "" format to keep us viewers in suspense as to the events. The movie itself is very..symbolical, in a way.

I suppose they may have trusted each other at one point, but after the robbery went horribly wrong, they could barely contain themselves.

While watching this movie you are transported to another realm, and in that sense you become one of the rag tag troop.

The fact that he made this movie with such a low budget yet it being so good makes it ever more charming. The characters are incredible, and all have their own moments that make you love them. (Personally, my favorite is Mr Orange.) The soundtrack is also awesome, and is the perfect mix of songs. After the torture scene, you'll never listen to 'Stuck in the Middle With You' again without thinking of it. The dialogue in this movie always makes me laugh, especially the ""Toby? Toby Wong"" line.

1022,3 August 2020,LaFlamaBlanca82,8, This is NOT a film about dogs!,"It's full of violent,serious,relationship,betroyal and ""F***ed"" word!!The ending is very classic. Tarantino was played with their actors too...He say ""brown likes s**t""... I give 10/10 for the powerful movement!!",
1023,24 August 2003,The_Foxxy,9, !!!!!!.....,"Most directors take a long time to get into the swing of the movie business, and become well known. Quentin Tarantino was one of the few lucky exceptions. Reservoir Dogs (1992) was a cool, yet brutally violent feature film debut, that took no apologizes by the ending frame. Think of the story first, a heist film, without the actual heist. It's a shame no ones thought of it until QT. Next, the cast feels so well placed in their own roles, that sometimes they can speak their lines like Shakespeare, but with profanity and crude jokes. And, thats just the beauty of Tarantino's dialogue, he captures it so well of how it can actually be uttered, that a script is unnecessary. All they would need is an outline of actions, and rest could be improvised. It's literally a movie you could quote for days on end. Another great aspect is the look of the film, the editing, and cinematography is smart without getting too out of control, with knowing when to pull away from the violence (ear scene,and final frame). Too violent, hmm?",
1024,29 March 2011,jigsaw1993-892-199869,10, Tarantio's First,"A great script, wonderful order to the movie and an absolutely stellar cast. The soundtrack from this movies is unforgetable and somewhat disturbing against the scenes.  This movie has kept it's edge and I think that it will age well.",
1025,27 December 2003,drcoulter,10, The best of Qentin's movies,"I think Reservoir Dogs is the best first movie. This movie is totally smell like Tarantino. Script is amazing, interesting and so funny. Characters are so original and unforgettable. I think Tarantino composed his genre in this movie. All actors are very good but Tim Roth's performance is so great. I love this film so much and I don't get bored to rewatch this crime masterpiece.",
1026,29 January 2018,emrealtintas,10, The best first film,"this film is very extraordinary in both originality and skill.it is a very original crime story,and the screenplay is great (it made me feel sick of the usual lazy hollywood thrillers).it is a wonderful breakthrough by tarantino. the level of reality in the violent scenes is very high,and in addition characters are very well developed(remembering Roth's acting thing,it was great). the structure was also very nice: flashbacks,telling the story from one of the guys' eyes etc.(which is nowadays used in the brilliant tv series ""boomtown"").cleverly written story. in summary,it takes the standards one floor up!",
1027,21 February 2004,borabosna,9, outstanding,Reservoir Dogs : Review by Kumayl Directed by Quentin Tarantino,
1028,31 December 2003,kumayl_patel-1,8, The Jumpstart that sealed Tarantino's contract with Hollywood!!,"Recently Empire magazine rated this film the greatest independent film, and I can definitely see why. Reverting to what one user said ""over-the-top gory, pointless violence"" any simpleton can see that, that statement is totally false, the violence minimal,and I mean extremely minimal, the gore?! what gore unless shooting someone is gory there is none of it the only potential gory scene in there is the well known ear-slicing which doesn't even appear on the scene! Reservoir Dogs is a fantastic film. There is no need for action in this movie, because the dialogue keeps you so in tune, something in which Tarantino excels at. The story of reservoir dogs on paper is nothing too fancy but the sharp dialogue, style and the non-linear style storytelling which Tarantino is known for is present and is superb in his debut.",
1029,28 September 2005,damiano_dentice,10, Proabbly if not the best indie film of all time.,"To start of I must say that I did know some of the plot before i watched the movie, but this has truly got to be one of the best movies of all time! This movie makes you feel like your sitting there in that abandoned warehouse. The plot would make for a great movie by itself and the script turns it into an amazing movie but the end makes it a classic. Each one of the characters is fit perfectly for their roles and there isn't a dialog in the movie which is wasted.",
1030,17 February 2012,aalok-joshi123,10, Simply Amazing,"I was intrigued by the relatively high rating for such a mediocre-sounding plot, but once I started watching, I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. The cast was what instantly sold me on this one - with movie greats like Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and a very intimidating performance by Lawrence Tierney, this movie's attention to the characters, is what truly makes it great. Tarantino's legendary directing guides this film through, what could have been, monotonous scenes with ease. The 7- something minute opening scene was one of my favorites, masterfully capturing the quirky relationship that each of the men were forced into. One of my absolute favorites.",
1031,7 November 2013,Ragefeast95,9," Fantastic cast, and directing.","first off, this is not an action movie period!!!! In a sentence it is the upbeat humorous and dark story of 8 thieves in a diamond heist gone awry. there are only about 5 scenes with guns at all, most of the action occurs through dialouge. The thing which you will enjoy most about this movie is the depth of the characters and the tiny details which add a real life flavor to the movie. at one point there is even a character telling a story in the story a character is telling. But, this movie is cinematic genius and there are no cliché parts or things you saw coming. And also you don't have to like the genre to find this movie entertaining. 10/10 it was as if this movie was meant to have you leave with a distinctively good feeling. rent or borrow it.",
1032,18 June 2004,Paradoxombie,10, A masterpiece,"It's hard to get your head around the fact that 'Reservoir Dogs' has been around for ten years. It's almost difficult to remember a time before Tarantino made such an enormous impact (good and bad) on movies, but I saw this movie first time round before the hype. All I knew was that, like another ""dog"" movie from the same era that I saw, 'Man Bites Dog', that it was supposed to be violent, funny and disturbing, and that it starred a long time favourite of mine Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth, who I mainly knew from Greenaway's 'The Cook The Thief His Wife & Her Lover'. Okay, I hope it's good I thought as I waited in the cinema listening to some half remembered 70s A.M. pop and a strange conversation about Madonna's sex life (the cinema was playing the soundtrack album before the main feature, but what did we know). Then the movie itself, electrifying and fascinating from the word go. It's impossible to describe the impact of seeing this for the first time without knowing what to expect! Still one of my greatest movie memories. Ten years later I've seen it countless times so the surprise has obviously worn off, but it is still a brilliant movie because beneath the violence and wise-cracks of Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi - 'In The Soup'), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen - 'Thelma & Louise'), and Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn - 'At Close Range'), there is a lot of depth, that being the very human relationship between Mr. White (Keitel) and Mr.Orange (Roth). To me that is one of the things that elevates this above the many lame and unoriginal ""Tarantinoesque"" movies we've had to endure since 'Pulp Fiction'. His imitators just simply don't have a clue!",
