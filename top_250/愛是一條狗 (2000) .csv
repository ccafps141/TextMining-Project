0,22 May 2001,the red duchess,8, A smartly modern elegy.,"There is a character in 'Amores perros' who looks like Karl Marx.  He is a tramp and an assassin, a good bourgeois who one day, Reggie Perrin-like, abandoned his family, and, un-Reggie Perrin-like, joined the Sandanistas in an effort to create a better world, earning 20 years in prison for his troubles.  Walking the streets with a creaky cart and a gaggle of mangy dogs, he was found by the policeman who jailed him, who gave him a dingy place to live, food, and the odd, non-official contract.",/
1,9 June 2017,TheLittleSongbird,10, What a masterful feature film debut,"Alejandro González Iñárritu's debut feature film 'Amores Perros' to me is one of the most remarkable film debuts there is in terms of direction and as an overall film. While he hasn't made a bad film (his weakest 'Babel' is still very good), even if some of his films are very divisive, 'Amores Perros' to me is his best.",r
2,11 June 2003,WriterDave,9, Doggie Holocaust makes for Best Mexican Film Ever,"Some people just won't want to sit through this film because of the overtly graphic and disturbing dog fighting scenes, which is ironic, because most people don't seem to mind the graphic violence involving the people in this film. Others simply won't watch it because of the subtitles. This is a shame, since this is by far the best film I have ever seen come out of Mexico (far better and more complex than the comparably immature ""Y Tu Mama Tambien""). Here we get an intertwining tale involving dog fights, petty gangsters, a tragically injured model, a cheating husband, an abused teenage wife, and a homeless hit man. As you might expect the homeless hit man becomes the soul of the film, and the dogs serve as a link, reminding us of the violence we inflict upon each other and nature, and the fractured relationships we think beyond repair, but are actually more resilient than we could ever imagine. Brilliantly directed with a great soundtrack and a bigger heart than you might initially perceive, ""Amores Perros"" is a deep, thought-provoking and utterly enthralling film that you will not soon forget.",e
3,25 April 2003,dromasca,9, On Men And Dogs,"This Mexican movie was surprisingly good. I confess the sin of prejudice concerning Mexican cinema, this being maybe the second Mexican film I have ever seen, but here my sins are punished. This is the work of a director of big talent. Hopefully, he will not be spoiled by the success.",v
4,16 May 2021,pawanpunjabithewriter,6," A Movie about life choices and its conclusions, Disturbing, Intense","It's a life-changing experience. Movie is highly violent, disturbing, harsh and intense, which is necessary too since the characters' upbringing lead them to that. It's so exceptionally well created that one little action creates a havoc in the lives of 3 different people, people who have no relation with each other. It seems relatable now considering how single pandemic Corona virus is changing peoples lives mostly for bad. I would not recommend this movie to anyone since it's highly disturbing and insanely violent and depressing. However, would suggest them to watch at their own risk. It's a little too stretched too, however, is fast paced no doubt.",i

6,11 October 2009,CihanVercan,9, Do dogs have personal characters? Or they just try to be loyal to their owners? What if they reflect our personalities by means of their loyalty?,"Thanks to contributors, plot synopsis has been very well written. Amores Perros is included in the most important movies for the beginning of the 21st century. It marked a new epoch with its thoroughly life-like vision on a twist of fate. Then in a 5 years' of time within more recognized movies, we started seeing similar plot schemes telling different stories over accidents that binds each person's fate. One of them was Crash, and it won the best picture Oscar in 2005.",w
7,6 March 2004,aknowles-1,8, Lest the Dramatic Structure be Stillborn,"True to the structure, Iñárritu attacks the subject of love with a multi-pronged approach, addressing three different stages, or complications, common in `love.'  All three storylines represent the `struggling' aspect of love.  It would be fair to say that Amores Perros, roughly translated to be `Love's a Bitch,' makes the ultimate statement, `Love is a struggle.' More specifically, however, Octavio's narrative can be most suitably seen as the `hunt for love' and acquisition or fight for it.  To be with his love, Susana, he must overcome both the fact that his brother is married to her and the fact that his dreams of leaving the city are hamstrung by his less than admirable socio-economic state.  Daniel and Valeria, who are about fifteen to twenty years Octavio and Susana's elders, represent love's most frustrating peak - when one is already in it and wants or needs to get out, for better of for worse.  Daniel is trying to get out of a marriage in which he has kids to be with the supermodel, Valeria, a woman whose meaning to him is ultimately superficial.  El Chivo, whose story is a perfect compliment to Daniel's, represents distance and alienation from love, inwardly looking at it from the outside.  He has abandoned his family twenty years prior to become a guerilla terrorist and now operates as a vagabond hit man.  It would be difficult to look at these three different `stages' of love in a classically structured film.  The episodic structure eases us between each stage, at no point forcing us to tolerate the unrealistic concept of one couple going through all of these stages.  Breaking it up into three different narratives, each revolving around different characters, presents the audience with the ability to view each story as independent the others, a more pervasive perspective.",/
8,4 January 2002,JesNollie,7," Three stories, one great, one good, one bad","This film consists of three intertwining stories, all involving dogs, and all laced with violence.  The first story we're shown, that of Octavio, is excellent.  Definitely a ""10"".  If the movie had stayed at this level it might have been the best film of the year, but the second segment is annoyingly bad.  Totally ridiculous, bad acting, lame story.  The third and final segment is very good.  I would recommend seeing this film, but I'd also recommend fast forwarding through the second segment.",r
9,11 April 2005,tricky_jgc,10," Must've beaten Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in the Academy Awards","I think we're talking about one of the best Mexican films ever (i say so, knowing there's been excellent Luis Buñuel films as well as Arturo Ripstein ones, like 'Principio y Fin' -Begining and End- that is this director's highest peak (based on the book by Naguib Mafusz)and Emilio 'El Indio' Fernandez ones that i don't personally like that much (even though he received the Golden Bear in the 'Berlinale').",w
10,19 July 2002,danielariasv,9, reality is weirder than fiction,"Maybe for most of you, people outside third-world countries like Mexico or Colombia, my home, movies like ths one are only representations of another world... something away from you. My city, medellin, is one of the most dangerous cities on the world. Mexico city can be as dangerous as medellin. I`m not talking about politics. maybe you haven`t lived violence as near as i have, but im gonna tell you something, that is the main reason i voted 9 this movie: Amores perros is not fiction. Its a perfect peep to what life is here. We have expensive models that go to stupid tv shows, we have dog fighting, we have mercedes, we have old trucks, we have killers, businessmen, we feel love, we have houses... our life, as you can see in the movie, isn`t as different as you think. Amores perros can show you that life is not easy here. but that`s it. What you saw is thousand`s of people life. that`s why it`s so magic to you. Yourè seeing what you will never live there, in london, new york, seattle, paris, berlin... reality is weirder than fiction... see it on amores perros, and you`ll believe me... live it here, and no movie will surprise you",4
11,16 December 2021,wumbi,10, Incredible,"This long movie can be exhausting to some people, running at plus 2 hours this movie is heavy on its story but it doesn't forget its characters. Telling three different interlinked story, each of which have different appeals and different lively characters. Those characters feel real and authentic, they have motivation, feelings and dreams and it is well acted. Lots of dogs violence but the dogs here are as important as the humans. I was impressed by the presentation, it is ruggy and gritty and it adds to the genuine feeling of the movie and you can feel Alejandro's passion for cinema. This movie can be too much for some people as there are lots of violence involving animals and the quite long runtime but I thoroughly enjoyed this.",7

13,9 August 2015,zetes,7," Good, but I didn't get much out of it","Three stories are connected by a horrific car accident in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's feature film debut. All three stories also revolve, at least to some extent, around dogs (the title translates to Love's a Bitch, with ""Bitch"" having a double meaning). The three stories vary in interest, in my opinion, and I struggled by the end to connect them or really to care about any of them on a deep level. Still, it's a pretty entertaining flick and very strongly directed. In the first story, Gael Garcia Bernal stars as a young man who's in love with his older brother's wife. He decides to enter his rottweiler into a series of dog fights, but he runs up against an opponent who isn't keen on losing. In the second story, a model (Goya Toledo) moves in with her boyfriend, but their happiness is immediately destroyed by the aforementioned accident. During her recovery, her beloved terrier disappears into a hole in their apartment's hardwood floor and never comes back. In the third story, a hit-man (Emilio Echevarria) who poses as a bum has an existential crisis. I more or less preferred them in the order they played out, though even the first story has its flaws (am I really supposed to have much sympathy for a guy who participates in dog fights?).",3
14,24 November 2003,camselle,10," Orale, guey!!!!!","A masterpiece. Plain and simple. This picture transcends any language and culture, making us all be able to relate to each of its characters. I don't buy the comparison to Pulp Fiction or any other work. The disregard of chronological scene order and intertwining storylines have been occuring in films for years. Its done for effect here, is all.",0
15,30 March 2007,commandercool88,9, Brutally Powerful,"'Amores Perros' is a shocking experience from visionary director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu. It's a difficult film to watch, one which continuously challenges its audience, but a reward in of itself for those who can withstand its brutality. It puts a magnifying glass to the pain of love, and those who are destroyed by it. It gives new meaning to the film title's literal translation, 'love is a bitch'.",0
16,29 March 2004,oneflewovertheapocalypse,7, Excellent Storytelling But Flawed,"I was really looking forward to this as I had heard all the hype about it off IMDb and managed to get it in a DVD sale for £8. The only thing that put me off was that there was dog fights in it and I don't take kindly to watching animal cruelty in films. I know it's not real but it reminds me that it does happen in some countries and it's just a bit upsetting but I thought to myself 'it's only a movie and I am sure it won't take anything away from it' and thankfully it didn't. I liked the way they put in the beginning of the film reminding us that no animal was hurt during the course of the movie because people don't usually watch the credits at the end unless they really want to because that quote about the animals doesn't really come up till the very last bit of the credits but without it at the beginning then I am sure there would be a lot of very upset people. But back to the film Amores Perros is all about three different stories that come together through a car accident and we see how there lives are before and after the accident. We start off with Octavio who lives at home with his abusing brother, mother and his brother's girlfriend who he has taken a shine to. His brother is always on at him and smacks about his partner which doesn't like but knows he can do nothing about it unless he wants his legs broken. His story begins when his dog kills a champion fighting dog owned by a ruthless gangster of the town.",2
17,24 January 2007,EUyeshima,9," A Car Crash, Canines and Consequences Examined in Iñárritu's Viscerally Powerful Feature Film Debut","If like me, you were dazzled by this year's ""Babel"", you will likely be as curious as I was to check out the first film in director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu's trilogy about death. Similar in narrative structure to ""Babel"", this viscerally shattering 2000 movie carries three overlapping stories tied together by a defining car accident. Written with dramatic precision by Guillermo Arriaga (who later wrote the other two films in the trilogy, ""21 Grams"" and ""Babel""), all three take place within the different social strata of Mexico City, and as the title implies (English translation: ""Love's a Bitch""), dogs are intriguingly pivotal to each story. Also like ""Babel"", the various interconnections among the stories do not come across as contrived but rather as emotional resonant in a gradually revelatory manner. Even though the movie runs an epic length of 153 minutes, it consistently holds your attention.",/
18,14 March 2002,Spleen,1," Brutal, unpleasant, and anyway, what's GOOD about it?","A movie shot in ugly, unsaturated greenish-black colours with a jiggly camera that shows dogs being ripped apart has three serious marks against it, right from the start.  It tries to harrow us with sheer length (two and a half hours is a long time under the circumstances), and in this it succeeds: after the truly horrible bit (in part three - you know the scene I'm referring to), I found myself taking an interest in the story at last, perhaps from a lack of anything better to do.  But it's too little, too late.  The three stories have nothing to do with one another (they coincide spatially at one point - big deal), and they're simply laid before us, without art, like three uncut, rotting slabs of reality TV.  If this film were a physical object there would be policemen standing around it saying, ""Move along, nothing to see here.""  And they'd be right.",?

20,1 May 2001,utzutzutz,5, What's the big deal?,"Will someone please tell me what all the fuss is about? If the presence of gore is the gauge of cinematic skill, then yes, AMORES PERROS is a masterpiece. But surely one first-time director's fascination with maimed dogs and Mexicanismo does not a 21st-century film template make. Granted, it's a somewhat cleverly crafted story, but this blood-guts-passion trip through Mexico City fails to make any real point or leave the audience with much to ponder. (Though I did find myself contemplating how they managed to locate all those dead-dog body doubles for the live dogs...)",e
21,21 May 2012,mike_2511,6, A film of two halves,"The first ninety minutes of so of Amores Perros is magnificent. It would maybe even qualify as one of the greatest films of all time.

It knocks the breath out of you the way ""Mystic River"" does (maybe even more so). The plot centers on a car wreck in Mexico City and how it affects several people.

26,20 January 2003,rps-2,4, A vile film about vile people in a vile place,"There is not one decent human being in this film. All are double crossing, untrustworthy wretches lacking any redeeming qualities. Drunks, killers, adulterers, bullies, liars, thieves and two timers. Not the sort of people I choose to spend my evening with. What is the point of three hours of thoroughly unlikeable and disreputable characters, most of whom fornicate graphically and frequently if ingraciously. I'm glad that my view of the world is neither so black nor so bleak. The acting is capable. The production is effective (if gloomy.) The juxtaposition of three stories around one car crash is an interesting (if unoriginal) concept. But the script is a morbid repudiation of the human race. There are more likeable characters in a Wagner opera. It probably is a good topic for discussion at film appreciation classes. But it is too dark, too morbid and too cynical to qualify as a great work.",_

29,18 October 2010,ildimo1877,4, Inspiringly unpleasant!,"A dense, overtly sophisticated, but never really wise, script by Mr. Arriaga gets the famed ""Inarritu treatment"" – otherwise known as ""fanciful free fall in the arms of obsessive despair and educated repulsion"". The ""problem"" with Amores Perros (also with 21 Grams and Babel) is you just can't ignore it. Or, to put it better, you'd feel some kind of terminal guilt (appropriately) if you did. The three intertwining stories revolve ambitiously and high-poweredly around the theme of fatalism, on ""love's a bitch"" (more or less the title), on ""brother against brother"" religious motifs, on Kieslowski, Poe, a bit of Mexican-period Bunuel, and on a to-the-point requiem on Viva La Revolucion. In short however, this is a salute to the idea of ""God laughing when people make plans"". (To be honest, God laughs when people make movies about God). In any case, the only one laughing in Inarritu's humorless universe could be God, though I don't really see why He'd be so pleased in seeing his creatures miserable as hell (). Obviously this is a vengeful divine presence overlooking the production of Amores Perros, a production stately (while recalling Mr. Babenko's 1981 Pixote) and, occasionally, inspiringly unpleasant. Undoubtedly a masterpiece for those who get their ideological kicks in non-American speaking filmmaking, an intriguing torture for the rest.",v
30,12 May 2005,esteban1747,8, Love for dogs or for money?,"The director Alejandro González Iñárritu did an extraordinary thriller combining masterfully three different stories where fighting dogs are included, and also using the camera in tricky ways several times probably to increase the excitement. In Mexico there are many ways to earn money for survival in some cases or for lucrative purposes in others. There fights among animals are arranged regularly. In Mexico the so-called Palenques are famous where the people go to see fights between cocks, but also fights of dogs are organized in places less formal than Palenques. In both fights the people bet, some small money but others high sums. The film goes around this issue of fights between dogs, where obviously you have always a persistent dog champion, highly susceptible to be killed by other means in order to take it away. But the film is in fact about the misery of the humans, no matter if they are poor or rich. Amores Perros is an exceptional film, and a sample of the quality of several new-era films in Latin America, which may compete easily in their plots and depth with other films made in Europe and USA.",

34,16 March 2014,SnoopyStyle,8, Love the first section,"This movie starts with a car chase ending in a horrific crash. The crash serves as a pivot for three interconnected stories. The first is Octavio (Gael García Bernal). He lives with his mother, his older brother, and sister-in-law Susana. He lusts for his brother's wife and wants to run away with her. A local hoodlum dog fights and one day, he sends his dog at Octavio's dog Cofi. It nearly kills the hoodlum's dog. Octavio takes Cofi into the world of dogfights to earn the money needed to escape with Susana. The second is the model Valeria who barely survives the car crash with a severely injured leg.

35,4 March 2012,jboothmillard,9, Amores Perros (Love's a Bitch),"From director Alejandro González Iñárritu (Babel, Biutiful), I spotted this Mexican film after reading about it in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, and it was rated five stars out of five by the critics, so I definitely had to see it. Basically this film sees three sets of characters connected together by a tragic car accident that brings them all together for the brief time, and we see the three points of view before, after and at the time of the incident. The first segment sees Octavio (The Motorcycle Diaries' Gael García Bernal) in love with his sister in law Susana (Vanessa Bauch), who is mistreated by his brother Ramiro (Marco Pérez), so he tries to persuade her to run away with him. To make the money he needs to start a new life with Susana, Octavio gets involved with dog fighting, and with his really savage black dog Cofi he makes enough money to travel, but she takes it with her husband. Cofi is shot by a rival dog owner, and Octavio stabs him before ending up in a car chase, driving with his lifelong friend Jorge (Humberto Busto), and obviously in the high speed they crash, with Jorge dying and Octavio badly injured. The second segment sees successful magazine publisher Daniel (Álvaro Guerrero), who has left his family to be with Spanish supermodel Valeria (Goya Toledo), and they end up in the serious car crash. Valeria severely breaks her right leg, meaning that she can no longer do her modelling, and forcing her to use a wheelchair while she recuperates in the apartment, and this is made even harder to cope with when dog Richie disappears chasing a ball down the hole in the floorboards. With the dog being heard under the floorboards, and unable to get him out, this causes friction between Daniel and Valeria, and trying to help Richie she ends up injuring her leg even more, causing internal bleeding and gangrene. The doctors had no choice but to amputate her right leg, so there is no chance to return to a modelling career, she is upset to no longer feel a sense of purpose, but she is happy to get Richie out from under the floorboards. The third and final segment sees former private school teacher turned tramp El Chivo aka The Goat (Die Another Day's Emilio Echevarría), who lives in an abandoned warehouse and roams the streets, and spends most of his time caring for abandoned dogs, but he is also a professional hit-man. At points in the film he is trying to make contact with his daughter Maru (Lourdes Echevarría), who he was forced to abandon at two years old after being sent to prison for twenty years, and her mother told her that he had died. There is a cutaway from this segment for a moment, that sees Ramiro and an accomplice robbing a bank, and they end up shot and killed, and injured Octavio tries to convince Susana again to run away with him, but she refuses, as she has lost her husband. Anyway, El Chivo witness the car accident, and he notices the injured black dog with a bullet wound, so he takes him back to the warehouse, and he recovers well, and he was going to carry out a new hit before the crash happened. While away from the warehouse El Chico is shocked and angered to see that the black dog has killed all his other rescued mongrels, but he cannot kill the dog as he would lose his only remaining companion. Next he goes to the man he has been paid to kill, and he ties him up in his warehouse, and learns his client is the man's half-brother, so he also catches and hold the client hostage. El Chivo decides to clean himself by cutting his hair and shaving his beard off, and he leaves the two restrained men in the warehouse, with a gun put between them, so they can have their fate decided for themselves. El Chivo breaks into his daughter's house, and he leaves a bundle of the money he earned, an altered photograph with himself in it, and an emotional answer phone message explaining who he is and why he had to abandon her as a child, and he walks into the distance with his dog, he names him ""Negro"". Also starring Jorge Salinas as Luis and Rodrigo Murray as Gustavo. The cast are all really good in their parts, especially Echevarría who is really sympathetic and a cool hired assassin, the third segment is definitely the most magnificent, the other two segments have their compelling moments as well. The imagery of violence with animals and the characters, the cursed love, the traumas and the tragedy seen throughout makes for powerful emotion and hard-hitting material, with well crafted characters, exciting sequences, and an extraordinary plot line with interconnected stories, this is a must see drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, it won the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!",

42,11 September 2014,Seraphion,7, Great interweaving of strong stories,"The movie serves the viewers with three sub-stories which don't really correlate. It opens up strongly with a sequence that serves as an anchor for all those sub stories. But the anchor isn't the only congruency point this movie uses. There are other quite meaningless rendezvous where the focus characters, who don't really know each other, meet and don't really share any line of dialog. But those smaller rendezvous serve well as time anchors, helping the viewers understand the timings of each scene. The stories also come very strong. Focusing on different backgrounds for each story, They each reveal themselves full of varied surprises and twists, although some of them are fairly predictable. The acting overall is just another decent effort. It sure is not really this movie's strongest point. But again, the story and the general story flow alone should suffice to make this movie good entertainment.",
43,17 August 2005,pc95,7, Superior Foreign Latin Movie,"Amores Perros really does a great job to keep the pace moving and enveloped me immediately. It is gritty and as the director put visceral in it's tension, pacing, and editing. The three tales are seamlessly interwoven, and although I found the 1st and 3rd tales more interesting, they're all inter-related fusing a magnificent series of events.. Even better...I'd thought ""Man on Fire"" did a good job of showing Mexico City as backdrop and setting, but this outweighs that a good deal. Although the colors often are drab, you can assimilate the dirt and griminess of some of the inner-city - people crowding, trying to co-exist in their own world of problems, creating problems for others in chain reactions. The filmmakers do a great job with moving back in forth in time intermixed along with Characters points of view too. Realistic characters like Octavio add credence. The characters are always at odds with themselves and their surroundings. Although the runtime is well over 2 hours, the movie whizzes by in a great way. Excellent film worthy of ownership. Highly recommended, but not a movie to make you feel wonderful.....",

I would rather contend that the characters in the film are more properly seen as connected by chance, but not necessarily linked to each other. In that sense, the film maker relies on a gimmick that appeals to the average movie goer, who sees a connecting thread and places more value on the picture as a result of it. That's not to say that the links aren't competently developed. The narrative moves rather seamlessly from the dysfunctional brothers engaged in dog-fighting, to the ill fated lovers and on to the former ex-guerrilla fighter who takes on the role of an assassin when it suits him. Viewers offended by anything that might not be politically correct should stay away from this film, lest they be severely offended by brutal scenes of dogs mangling each other, a glamorous model who has her leg amputated, and the wayward vagabond unable to reconcile with his past life and abandonment of a daughter at a young age. Over all, this is a well made film with a well structured story that ultimately leaves the viewer somewhat disoriented because there really is no closure for any of the principals.

But the second time I felt freer just to watch all that was unfolding in the lives of the characters and I loved it.

A man trying to get his brother's wife to run off with him (and failing), a supermodel who suffers a career-ruining accident and an old man who gave up his family to join a guerilla movement and has deep regrets.  The best character in the movie and also the most moral, is the latter, El Chivo (Emilio Echevarría).  He is an occasional hitman, has the appearance of a tramp but has a lively mind and a caring disposition (not to mention a penchant for opportunist thievery).  Really, it is this character that carries the heart of the film.  The dogfighting scenes are cleverly done, using minimal footage of the dogs actually fighting.  However, there are many scenes of what look like damaged or dead dogs after fights which are quite unnerving.  Indeed, 3 people left the showing I went to, presumably because of the dogfights.  In the grand scheme, the dogfights are a useful metaphorical device, although to the film's credit, two of the dogs featured are crucial characters in the story. In a similar manner to Magnolia, all three stories interlink via catastrophe.  No raining frogs here, this time a calamitous car crash. ",

Later bought DVD, and watched movie a couple of times and realized, in some way, that this film is even better than Pulp Fiction. It's more human than any US multi-plot-anachrono-psycho-thriller film that I ever watched. Acting is very intense, young Bernal and old Emilio especially, and the cohesion of the different-class stories is excellent. Also I must say that the tempo of a movie and soundtracks of the song are doing just in a right way. Comparing ""Crush"" to this masterpiece is like comparing Coldplay to Radiohead in rock music. Although I never saw a Mexican film before (only their moronic love-story series), I felt like I was right there in Mexico city, while watching.

In fact, I don't know why it isn't done more often. But 'Amores Perros' definitely transcended its sources, and the crucial role of the dogs as a mirror for the humans at a stroke gave this file an originality and depth to make it stand out. For me, two of the most moving scenes were when Richie is finally rescued from beneath the floorboards, and then when El Chivu comes home to discover what 'Blackie' has done to the rest of his dogs, which in retrospect, was probably the film's key moment. In fact, despite all the canine gore, I think that dog lovers (myself included) get more  out of the film than those indifferent to them, as there's more emotional involvement.",

Does Susana really love Octavio, or it's just passion, and yielding to his constant advances ? Does Ramiro love his wife and the kid, or it's just helplessness,to stay together, being threatened to get killed, by Octavio's hired killers ? Does El Chivo loves his daughter, or it's more the need for revenge , in retaliation to betrayal ? And why does Valeria love Daniel, a much married, middle-aged man, not very handsome either ? their love-hate relationship, after she is devastated by that car accident, in which she first becomes wheel chaired, and then with a major handicap, when her leg is amputated ? It's too complex a drama for getting simple answers ! Yes, we have seen movies like, Unfaithful, Perfect Murder, and so many others, on infidelity, adultery, and revenge, but nothing like this before ! At one point, the characters get down to the lowest level of mercilessly fighting dogs , to make their living, or even much more than that, by staking, assaulting, double-crossing, robbing banks, and evading law, on the other point, they give in to their basic instincts . The dogs too, snap the necks of each other, at the first opportunity. But when the dogs bleed, and are badly injured, just waiting to breathe their last, the humans are truly over-whelmed, desperately trying to save them, realizing their place in their lives ! Inarritu has put his heart and soul, while directing this drama, and unfolded, reunited ,all the stories together, doing a wonderful job of it all. It's really touching to see, almost all the characters, reduced to a pathetic state, yet clinging on to each other for some support. Some of the noteworthy scenes are, El Chivo transforming his persona, by shaving etc, and pasting his photo,along with his family, Valeria looking out of the window, after her leg is amputated, a desolate Mama Susana, after Octavio climbs the stair case ,by hurriedly pushing her past, on realizing that Susana has fled with his money.... Some how, Valeria and Daniel's story lacks the grip, and excitement, like the other ones, and that part of searching for Richie the pet dog , under the wooden flooring, as well as flashing her poster, Enchante, could have been edited, for better results. It's also not very convincing, Daniel saying good bye to his happy family, while he loves his daughters so dearly ? Even his wife seems to love him so, that she has almost forgiven him for his unfaithfulness, and wants him back ! Not one of those pop corn flicks, this movie makes you think about our basic principles in life, and the amazing hand of that unseen supernatural power, which creates ripples in our lives, reaching beyond our scope, as Inarritu believes ! Those street dogs will never be the same for me at least !",

99,7 March 2023,jromanbaker,1, Dogs and Men.,"Dogs and men dominate this rather nasty film, which has garnered so much praise that everyone has probably heard of it or seen it. It has taken me over 20 years to get round to that dubious privilege, and the opening hour filled me with nausea. It certainly heralded a new century of brutal wars, terrorism and horror and I would like to think that the dogs pitifully ignorant of their desire to kill was a metaphor for war and not only sensationalism. After close analysis of the car crash and the three stories that relate to it in the film I found little to like and in my opinion it is just sensationalism. The dog fighting is nauseating in itself, and no artistic excuses can excuse it. In a quiet scene in the second part of the film where an injured woman searches for her dog beneath open floorboards and screams and struggles away at the sight of rats is relaxing to see compared with the rest. No more spoilers. As for the jerky camera throughout a large part of the film it had a nausea of its own, or was it just excited pleasure erotic or otherwise to attract the viewers into their own excitement at so much ' machismo ' indulgence ? I suggest viewers to watch Bunuel's ' Los Olvidados ' for the great Mexican film, which this is not.",

A façade of decadent modern urban life not unlike that of Los Angeles (including similar cultural and linguistic features).......an underlying set of violent themes paired with parallel expressions of love and longing.......recurrent traces of a fatalistic view of life.......the whole Machismo thing coupled with degrading portraits of women who can't get it together.......the pattern of crooked cops playing both sides against the middle.......and not the least gruesome scenes of dogfights (could have been cockfights, for that matter).",

106,17 January 2002,mark_leeforshaw,10, A Masterpiece,"""Amores Perros"" is a raw and visceral experience. Real passion, intelligence and craft has gone into making this wonderful film. By contrast most other films of the last few years seem bland and antiseptic. The film places the viewer right in the heart of urban Mexico, and amidst this teeming environment the characters' lives play out - full of immanent (and often eruptive) violence and feeling. The film has one of those episodic structures familiar from ""Traffic"", ""Short Cuts"" and ""Magnolia"". Yet it is a superior work to all of these films, not only because it feels less contrived, but also because it is blessedly free of the kind of characters who spend far too long hand-wringing and feeling sorry for themselves. Refreshingly, ""Amores Perros"" is not concerned to dissect ""dysfunctional"" people or ""dysfunctional"" social systems. It pulls off that rare trick of seeming to issue from right inside the worlds it portrays, rather than standing apart from them. This may well be an illusion, but that of course is what makes the achievement of ""Amores Perros"" all the more impressive. (It is also one of the only films I have ever seen that uses animals to signify in a way that is neither sentimental nor monstrous.) 10/10",

If Mexicans are this stupid & their doctors that bad, no wonder many Mexicans prefer to live in a US prison than to live in Mexico City. The only defense you can make for the middle episode is that it must be a surreal statement on the stupidity of the very concept of a ""super-model"". Unfortunately, it is surreal how bad it is & how amateurishly heavy-handed the symbolism is. If they re-release this film with the entire 2nd episode removed, I might give this 8 or 9 stars.

116,12 November 2009,sfizzle,7, An Interesting Take on Love,"The first thing to understand about Amores Perros (or ""Love's a Bitch"") is that its title provides great insight into the interpretation of this film. At first glance, the film appears to be about the differing aspects of romantic love: Octavio and Susana's steamy and guilty affair, Daniel and Valeria's not-so-steamy and guilty affair, and El Chivo's remorse over having left his family several decades prior. However, it is much more than just a film about the various aspects of love represented. I'd argue that it is titled ""Amores Perros"" because the film is pointing out the flaws in romanticized love. The three subplots weave together to give the audience a modern view of the realities of love: young, emotional teenage love with Octavio and Susana, old, superficial, failing love with Daniel and Valeria, and a non-sexual love found between family with El Chivo. One of the most powerful aspects of the film is its paradoxical combination of violence in a movie where the main subject is, ironically, love. Most of the graphic violence has to do with the dogs, not humans. This itself helps define the film's thesis on love. In many ways, the characters care more about their dogs than they do about their 'lovers', which goes to show how deep their love actually is. The car chase scene is a perfect example of this because Octavio is willing to stab his brother's friend over his dog Cofi being shot, and get into a car chase which ends up crippling Valeria. Subsequently, Daniel's superficial love for Valeria is stifled and ultimately crushed by her crippling injury, leading him to abandon her. Octavio's ""love"" for Susana leads him to enter violent dog fighting arenas in order for him to make money so she can leave her husband for him. Meanwhile El Chivo is the example of what ultimately happens to everyone: guilt over what they did to their lovers (or, In El Chivo's case, his family). After seeing this film, all I know is if this is what love is, I don't want anything to do with it. It's all incredibly selfish and violent, hence the title.",

It is made up of three main stories, whose characters affect each others lives without even knowing it.  The film goes back and forth in time, to intrigue the viewer and to show how what starts as small decisions or actions can have drastic consequences. The film shows characters that run the gammut of Mexican society, from the life and mysterious past of an older street person, to members of a poor/lower middle class Mexican family, to a wealthy succesful family man and beautiful young model.

Great, somewhat complicated directing, and excellent characterization for whom both the high-quality script and the superb performances of the cast are equally deserving.

The first story is centered on a young man that is in love with his stepsister and decides to convince her to run away with him from her abusive, thieving husband by bringing her money he won from the world of underground dog fighting.  The second story is of a man that leaves his wife and kids in order to live a dream life with a supermodel.  And the final story is centered on a homeless, ex-politician hitman whose only goals in life are survival by any means and to reveal to his grown daughter who her real father is.  This segmented, subtitled film is horrifically violent at times, depressing, shocking, and even part comical, yet the bleak, bloody, and raw tone of the film suppresses your laughter.  You struggle to force yourself to continue being drawn into the terrible yet fascinating multiple worlds of the characters, as Inarritu shows how his stories collide by one brutal car accident.  This was definitely one of the best films of 2001, and should appeal to any audience. Although graphically violent, there is no unnecessary footage purely for shock value, and I think this film is so powerful it should be seen by all, even those easily offended by violence.

144,17 March 2002,PhilauraJ,10, Outstanding Film - But Certainly not a Family Film,"I would like to clarify one thing. I almost didn't see this because of the reviews here that claimed dogs tear each other apart in this film   This is not exactly true. The storyline includes dogs that are torn apart, but you do not see any of this. The viewer sees the suggestion of a dog fight with the initial contact made by the dogs (pretty much a chest collision) and very little else of the fighting dogs. No gory flesh tearing as I was afraid of.  It is very disturbing to see the aftermath of dogs portrayed as dead (presumably on a sedative that rendered them unconscious) tongues hanging out with red splashed about their bodies,  but there is no torn flesh nor tearing of flesh shown. At no time does the film become a ""slasher"" film. What it suggests is very emotional and sad, but it is done in a way that I felt was tasteful (if a dogfight can be tasteful) and certainly viewable. I didn't feel I had to close my eyes to avoid being offended.  I have great respect for the makers of this film. I won't go on about that because others here have covered the bases. I will only say, that it is an excellent film about love and how painful and disturbing it can be.  Bravo!",

The combination and overlap of 3 different stories keeps the audience involved but it isn't apparent until nearly the end of the film how closely each storyline is related. There is a lot of blood and violence but it heightens the tension and draws the audience into the plot. The casting of each character is perfect and the acting is superb and Inarritu's representation of infidelity and love throughout the film is well thought out and authentic. Emilio Echevarria is perfect as El Chivo and Gael Garcia Bernal gives another amazing performance just as he did in Motorcycle Diaries.",

Amores Perros is one of those films. It's a Spanish film from auteur director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and it intertwines three stories, all with themes of love and loss. The three stories connect through a horrific car crash that changes the lives of all the characters permanently. The first story is about Octavio who is obsessed with his sister-in-law Susana. He wants to run away with her so he enters his dog into the dog fighting arena to raise the money. The second story is about supermodel Valeria who has just moved in to a new apartment with her lover, Daniel. Her story opens with the car crash, and we witness her difficult physical and mental deterioration. The third story is about El Chivo, an assassin who cares for Octavio's dog that was wounded in the crash. Chivo is on a quest to put his life back in order by setting things straight with the daughter he abandoned so many years ago. All three stories are equally excellent in their construction and despite the film clocking in at 2 and a half hours, you never want it to end.",
155,30 December 2001,schachtmant,10, A terrific achievement,"Amores Perros is a manically-paced, emotionally exhausting and challenging film.  It successfully interweaves several stories (as has become quite common in the past decade, e.g., Dahl, Tarantino, Tykwer, McKellar, Egoyan) as it tells a story of desperation and struggle in Mexico City.  Combining the adrenaline rush of Pulp Fiction with the camera angles and slower views of street scenes that reminded me of Kieslowski, the director gives us a tale of how a single event can dramatically transform one's life (the loss of a leg for a fashion model, the loss of his beloved pets for a worned man in poverty).  Whereas the dogs early in the film symbolize what is wrong with the characters, the dogs later catalyze or at least symbolize many of the emotional transformations for the characters and it might even be able to said that the animals inspire the adults to embrace a more responsible attitude towards others, reminding me of the role of children on selfish adults in many recent Iranian films. The acting of Amores Perros shouldn't be ignored (and may be overlooked as the acting was so effective that the actors seemed like they WERE their characters  so to speak...the greatest compliment for actors).  Bernal, for one, was simply outstanding. I often judge acting on the range of emotions conveyed.  Bernal did it all.  This gifted director is one to watch for in the future.",

For me however, if I want to watch something as meaningless as this movie I'd rather just be entertained by a bad Hollywood action movie. Watching Amores Perros is a chore to say the least. And as for the violence it is sparse and hardly anything for people to be shocked about. What is shocking is that people on here are actually posting that it is hard to watch because of the violence and crying about animal cruelty. Please, most of the scenes with the dogs only show them wrestling like 2 friendly puppies then cut to some staged scenes with fake blood. So, if you are one of those people considering getting this because of the violence just rent a National Geographic or pour some ketchup on the person next to you instead. My only guess as to why this is rated so high is that non-Spanish speakers are watching this without subtitles and just assuming it must be deep because, well, aren't all non-American films deep?",

They are both great but I think I would vote for the this one as it is even more hard edged than 21 grams. Maybe because it is Mexican and not American  it was a little more convincing.

Oh yeah, right, I always rob banks, take my dog to secret rooms for violent fighting, carry guns in my pockets and stab people. Sorry, this is not something I plan to live, Mr. director and writer.  And this is also why films often bother me:  There's a cultural assumption out there that film is somehow ""like real life"" or representing history validly and this simply not so.  And this film does not portray ""love"" as I understand it.  Love to me is about nuturing and support.  What I see portrayed in this film is people living out dysfunctional family patterns unconsciously and hurting each other in the process.  True, this is ""like real life"", but hopefully we seek out support or help before we turn to some of the extremes that these characters do.  All of the characters in this film inflict violence on themselves and others around them because they are unable to confront these deep patterns.  I think I would have liked the film more (or at least empathized with some of the characters more) if at some point recognition of these dysfunctional patterns was made conscious.  The director/writer never does this.  I liked the ambient soundtrack.  Similar to the Cliff Martinez stuff in Steven Soderbergh's films.  The film was well shot.  I cried in a few scenes.  I didn't like the macho-ness of the male characters.  Susanna's character also really bothered me.  I got a little bored in some parts.  Overall, an OK film.  Not ""outstanding"", sorry to say.",

173,15 July 2006,jach3,9, A new step in Mexican film industry,"When I think in recent Mexican movies, the majority involve a lack of originality, full with clichés of corruption, political situations, economic situations, even language ones. The reason I believe that it's because people in the Mexican film industry don't want to risk the originality of their thoughts, or more specific, their money... But I believe, as the saying said ""Who doesn't risk, doesn't win"" that its for sure a difficult business, but it isn't impossible. Actually, the more you risk, with this I mean a equal balance between what you feel and what you think, the more you get. Amores Perros did this step, they risk for something never done in Mexican Film History, and they did it right, I'm not saying that it wasn't done before, It was in movies like Los Olvidados of Buñuel or Y Tu Mama También of Cuarón afterward.

Instead of trafficking in views of a futile drug war, this film is trafficking in stunning views of human frailty. It is engrossing and deeply affective. The dog theme, which loosely ties the three plot lines, is very effective at grounding the grander observations about lust, greed, corruption and fallen idealism. A climactic focal point of all three story lines, a car accident, is at the film's core. ""If you want to make Him (God) laugh, make plans."" One of the characters delivers this line, a quotation from her grandmother, as though she were also watching the film with the audience. It sent a chill right down my spine. I was aware of the film's length, 153 minutes, but it was an awareness based in feeling full, nearly uncomfortably so. There is much to be taken from the stories and much to observe while the film is running. It is dense and deep. I will see this film again.

How do I have to see it? Inspired by Tarantino or the kind of movies that inspires Tarantino? Who knows but it certainly has the Tarantino-effect. What first looks like a mess (all different shoots that can't be combined at first) falls into one piece, the perfect puzzle and let me tell you this : most of the Hollywoodscenarists better watch some movies like these, they can learn a lot. It has no sense to tell the story, just see it as a modern fairy tale in where the rich and the poor find each other in a world of crime. Sole reason why I disliked the movie a bit was because of the many cruel views of bleeding dogs (dogfighting is a bit the focal point in here), but that apart I can say : what a brilliant movie, give us more of these!!!",
179,3 July 2007,grammyscold,2, Look What I Can Do!,"Embarrassingly derivative of other works, Amores Perros had me wondering if perhaps the filmmakers name was not perhaps a pseudonym for Steven Soderbergh or Quentin Tarantino. Others may enjoy the director's technical proficiency, but they would have to have the capacity to ignore the hack-like vibe at this film's core. At times, the re-hashed vibrancy of the film had me hoping it might actually be a comment on the aforementioned filmmakers' tradition of stylized pomp, that it might pull away from its pure film-making pizazz -- but, no. Instead of substance, there lay another sequence of pure, exhilarating kinetic energy. The problem with that energy is that it focuses on characters so disagreeable, engaged in activities so repellent, that I simply could not are very much about them. However grim the outcome, the shallow characterizations made it difficult to tie any semblance of emotional commitment to them. The actors try, but ultimately fail, to flesh themselves out. The way the script functions, the inhabitants of this world are doomed to be seen as archetypes, rather than authentic humans, in instance after instance of harrowing circumstance. Then there's the overlong running time which the film struggles (and fails) to justify. Having to put up with the unrelentingly nihilistic subject matter is like repeated lashings in the face with a wet shoelace -- having to endure Amores Perros' length seems an excessive punishment to an already forgiving audience. Two-and-a- half-hours may be an acceptable running time for films that have the weight of history behind them, but this is ultimately a student exercise in how to use style to convey mood. For all its kinetic, stylized energy, this is just a one-note tragedy; a violent, expensive Spanish soap opera with an excessive running time.",

Maybe there is no other pleasant way to tell this story without making it less effective. Whichever it is the final result is a staggering piece of true cinema.,

These stories get united while the movie advances. The acting in this movie is very powerful, not forgetting how Iñarritu directed this film, so deep and strongly. Considerated as one of the most powerful movies ever, and nominated for many, many awards including the Academy Award for best Foreign Language Film, and winner of 11 Ariel Awards (Mexican Movie Awards), this movie proves that Mexican cinema is very alive and deep. Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu introduced himself and Gael Garcia Bernal in this masterpiece, and won respect worldwide.",
210,19 June 2001,david_macgowan,10, A modern masterpiece,"Recently compared to ""Pulp Fiction"" for its structure, Amores Perros is much more complex and serious. The dogs are allegories, of course, for all that is wrong with the world (and Mexico in particular) but this is a multi-layered, beautifully acted, jerkily (and grittily) shot film by a director who knows exactly what he wants to say and how to say it. Some images are startling (blood flows like spitting butter over a griddle in a restaurant shooting) and heart-rending (an unrecognised old man waves uncertainly to his long-lost daughter through her bedroom window after years of no contact). But there is also humour and love amid the constant betrayals and carnage. And, also, there are the dogs.",
211,3 July 2019,Endless_01,8, A tragic tale about the lives of the world.

The premise of the film is to present the story of 3 characters intertwined by a particular event; we see how this event has changed their lives over the years and how they remember with feelings the actions that led to it, whether good motives, vain or simple daily decisions, now must live with their hard experience. In Spanish we use the slang ''Perro'' to refer to something hard, difficult or complex, and the film portrays very well the meaning of its title through the beautiful narrative and history it possesses, realistic, emotional and in touch with the modernity of 2000. A unique and interesting work that presents one of the best cinematographic works of Latin America.",

A friend mentioned his work in Babel (2006) and how great that was. I hadn't seen his earlier films including this one which is now nine years old. As I went back to Amores Perros, It caught my eyes as a work of art.

The 3 graphic and somehow hiper-violent (realistic?) stories in this movie get deep into our emotions. In the first story, a young Octavio secretly lures about his sister-in-law, Susana, and trying to get money to help her, enters the world of dogfighting.  In the second one, Valeria, a supermodel, and Daniel, a succesful editor who has abandoned his family in order to be with her, live very despairing moments when losing a small dog. Finally, el Chivo, a dirty, old, angry hitman who likes dogs, get paid for killing a young succesful executive, and maintains a mysterious interest in a pretty girl. Along the 3 stories, the fate of the dogs became a metaphor of the lives of their owners. A very good film, strong, honest and of a new kind of directors in Mexico. The soundtrack is fantastic (specially a song from Nacha Pop, called ""Lucha de gigantes"") and we must thank the Director for showing us a different view of Mexico very far away from the ""taco"", the ""indio"" and the ""narco"" movie.

Others simply won't watch it because of the subtitles. This is a shame, since this is by far the best film I have ever seen come out of Mexico (far better and more complex than the comparably immature ""Y Tu Mama Tambien""). Here we get an intertwining tale involving dog fights, petty gangsters, a tragically injured model, a cheating husband, an abused teenage wife, and a homeless hit man. As you might expect the homeless hit man becomes the soul of the film, and the dogs serve as a link, reminding us of the violence we inflict upon each other and nature, and the fractured relationships we think beyond repair, but are actually more resilient than we could ever imagine.

229,12 February 2005,Cineman187,9, Taking a stroll through Mexico's mean streets,"What must be said of this superb Mexican film is that it is far superior to Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's follow up film '21 Grams'. Combining three separate stories into one horrific car crash we see elements of the script reminiscent of Tarantino. Set on the streets of Mexico City we are given a close look at how three people go about their everyday lives. Octavio (Bernal) is a young man who is in conflict with a a number of people such as his brother and rival dog fighter - the dog fighting scenes are so realistic they must be real. We are shown a young woman named Valeria; she is a beautiful model who is entering into a complex relationship. And finally there is El Chivo 'The Goat', a once lone hit-man for the government. His story is again involved with the heartbreak of love and how he copes with it. Together all three individuals show immense struggle to overcome great adversity and try to resolve their problems that seemingly go on and on. The grittiness of this film complements the compassionate love that smothers each character. An intelligent film, with fast paced Mexican rap (Control Machete) and Nacha pop, which is subtle music of acoustic rock ballad, we find a very intriguing and emotional story. It may seem like a very bleak and cold film but it does have a lot of life, which you should expect from such a populated city as Mexco City. This film is a must see for all fans of foreign cinema, but for those who have not tasted more European cinema then this film will definitely leave the sweetest taste.",

But where Tarantino uses cool one-liners and beautiful set-pieces to make his mark, the director of Amores Perros uses his camera do disturb us, awake us, break us. This movie shows that we are all wolves among wolves, selfish, brutal and animal-like. This movie will definitely scare and disgust many people, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I have never seen such brutality become beautiful. Try it, it is worth every single minute. It runs at over 2.5 hours, but you won't notice it (it's not Saving Private Ryan anyway)because there is so much to see, and it is unbelievable that this can be a director's debut.

It showed levels of Mexican society, other than the corrupt general in the drug trade, and the simple honest poor peasant. We Americans mostly think of Mexico as the desert border, Tijuana or a resort that the Love Boat stops at. But through this  triptych like story, we see the dichotomy of Mexico City, in much of the same ways we used to see the extremes of New York City in some of the better 70's movies.

237,23 June 2004,DenBez,10, Amazing intertwining story lines,"Amores Perros is a Spanish film with a great reputation that I happened to have on DVD from the college library. I'd heard a lot of good things about Amores Perros, but I hadn't heard much about the plot, which was a good thing. Half the fun of this movie realizations that you get about the plot as the movie goes on. You get more and more information about each of the characters until right at the end it all makes sense. All I will say about the plot is that it has three separate story lines that meet at a car crash then go off on their own again. And all of them have to do with dogs. Beyond that, watch the movie for yourself. The movie's title is translated to ""Love's a Bitch"", and that is a very good representation of the themes in the movie. Love is involved in each storyline, and in each one it goes sour, or has dire consequences on the character. In the end, no one is satisfied, and pretty much everyone ends up worse off than they were at the beginning. This is absolutely brutal film-making, and it will make you wonder about the absolute futility of life portrayed here. There is very good acting all around, and all of the characters are believable. The camera-work, although it doesn't the stylish techniques that contributed so much to Requiem For A Dream, is very sturdy and never boring, although action movie fans may not like its artful touches and close-ups. In fact, action movie fans won't like this movie at all. Despite dog fighting scenes, this is definitely not an action-oriented film.

The stories tie together better than any other movie with similar formulas. It's all so well done, even the acting. AMAZING job by Emilio Echevarria as El Chivo. One of the most complex characters I've ever witnessed in film or TV. I think it was the best performance of the year internationally, he could have been nominated for so much even an Oscar. The rich husband and wife plot was so extreme and interestingly dramatic. And not to mention the first hour just grabs you by the neck and doesn't let go.

So for people, it is largely a matter of choice. This lack of respect and compassion extends to all living things.

The acting was good (7.5-8), the cinematography was great (8.5), the score and soundtrack was great and really added to the film (9). The story was what really bothered me; it's extremely difficult for me to sympathize with any of the characters because, with the exception of one, all the bad things that happen to the characters happen because of poor, selfish choices that they make. It's a little like Requiem for a Dream in that respect, but it's not quite as fatalistic. I'd give the story a 6.

The fact that the character's live turns dark as soon as we are introduced to them makes it a little hard to empathize with them. Personally, I am more affected by drama in movies if it destroys something that is beautiful. Therefore, I think the fact that this movie is so dark actually limits how sad it can be.

252,4 February 2008,andizapatagj,10, the best movie ever made,"This movie is perfect in every possible way. Every scene and every moment of it is dramatic and heartbreaking at the same time, every story has something to tell and reflects a reality of life and the world, specially in the Mexican society for poor but also rich people. One crash changes the life of three different people that had nothing to do with each other but after the accident will be connected forever. In my opinion the first story is the one that has more power and impact, it talks mostly about obsession, how a guy can be so obsessed with his brother in law to the point of trying to her steal away from his brother. What i liked the most about this story was the different points of view from octavio and susana, she wanted to feel protected with her kid and understood or supported while octavio wanted to sleep with her and was more obsessed in kind of a physical and immature way. But at the end they don't end up together and thats when octavio really starts growing up and stops thinking as a child that wants his toy no matter what. The other story that had me crying was the one of el chivo that just wanted to be accepted and forgiven by his daughter in a cruel society when he was a murderer but decided to change to be better for the only person he had left. Finally, the story of daniel and valeria certainly was the most weak but necessary. Showing that also rich people can suffer and have problems. Here we find a supermodel, valeria that is happy with daniel, a man that recently left his wife but has a car accident and after wards neither her life or the life of his boyfriend is the same again. Her dog ritchie is trapped in the floor and the advertisement she worked for doesn't want her anymore because of her leg problem and daniel is thinking about going back to his wife and kids. One very strong scene is when we watch they are taking the poster of her from the building and shes crying while daniel takes her hand. That is hope, makes you think they will stay together no matter what. I agree with the poor treatment of dogs but it was necessary to show the message to the audience and impress them in such a way. This is by far the best movie of iñarritu and the best film in my list.",

257,21 September 2013,BhagavathyPadmanabhan,10, Love is a bitch! Really!,I loved this movie from the word go!. Fast moving - great screen play and story unfolding. Special mention about dog fight - I don't know how they took some shots - it was good. Great entertainment even now. In this movie the greatest starring is played by fate. That decides everything and so in that sense everything just changes in just a second. And how that change affects three interconnected stories is very engrossing and meaningful. I personally felt that what Octavio was doing absolutely wrong and appreciate the way Susana did. She kept telling Octavio that she loves her husband no matter what!. Daniel's character was just perfect for the setting. El Chivo's character was the one which made more deep message for me. Valeria - the model's change after the accident and her crazy attraction for her pet dog - is very chilling because of the way the story was set. Amores Perros has meaning for any one. It makes one introspect. A must watch and my rating 10/10.,

259,7 May 2011,rachelbh32,9, A masterpiece that will stick with you,"""Amores perros"" brilliantly winds three utterly different stories together in a complex and fascinating masterpiece of a film. Three individual stories are all developed thoroughly with great attention to detail. Where the stories intersect is, ironically, is a street intersection with a violent car crash that shakes up the lives of multiple individuals. Octavio, Valeria, and El Chivo are the centers of each perspective story, all of whom's lives are shaken up by the car accident. Each life tells the story of an impossible love that is hindered in some way by hurt, lies, deceit and passion. The impossibility only swells or is brought to life after the accident when their ""love"" is exposed, vulnerable and uncertain. Acting is impeccable; viewers will be on edge for all 154 minutes of the film. Editing is superb; fast cuts and contrasts of colors bring to light the constant battle for a peace and equilibrium that cannot exist: they just remain contrasted. This movie is a must-see for its artistic achievements in story and presentation.",
260,11 May 2011,abigail-sawyer,10, one of my all-time favorites,"This is by far one of my favorite movies. Iñárritu, in his usual fashion, demonstrates his capability to take three complex story lines and weave them together into a cohesive film. The three micro-stories (Octavio and Susana, Daniel and Valeria, El Chivo y Maru) are all connected by a single car crash, but it takes the whole movie to piece together the puzzle of how they are all connected. I think that the reason I like this movie so much is the raw emotion that is portrayed. It is definitely not an easy one to watch, and at times I had to close my eyes because I simply couldn't stand the images that flooded the screen, but I couldn't stop watching. It's just so real – the love, the frustrations, the disappointment, the small moments of happiness. Even with all the unfortunate events, the film doesn't leave you empty or depressed. I'm not quite sure why, but there is a sense that yes, life and love are difficult, but that it is okay to struggle and hurt and cry.",

In one story, protagonist caves into lust and doesn't care whether God laughs at his plans; contrastingly, in the third plot beleaguered veteran, an assassin, tries to see clearly even though he jests earlier in the movie that if God wishes him to see everything blurry, he will do so.

264,10 March 2002,Robbo-7,8, A Bitchin' Film!,"This Mexican film, apparently set in the state of Pueblo, tells three modern stories of life in a nation and world where money increasingly serves as the arbiter of `success.' The threads involve such disparate elements as dog-fighting, bank robbery, high-fashion modeling, magazine editing, and daytime TV. These are tied together by dogs, a high-speed car crash, and the character of El Chivo, a former Marxist guerilla who abandoned an upper middle class existence to fight the grimy war for social justice, but ultimately had to settle for the occasional contract hit on a member of the capitalist elite. Amores Perros is translated on screen as ""Love's a Bitch,"" but the title is also a homonym of ""Amor Esperas,"" roughly ""Love Hopes."" This must be intentional, but I found little honest hopefulness in this film. Whether in the barrio or uptown, we are presented a relentlessly dog-eat-dog world seldom touched by elevating elements like religion, art, or family celebrations. It is a world of diversions, such as sex, television, renting a movie, or buying a new car. Ever-present dogs alternately comfort or snatch up the remains (when they're not killing each other).",

A place where the worlds of the rich and the most poor people collide. You can go into a Prada store with hungry children begging for food in front of it. This movie captures the essence of this city, it intensely shows the difference of problems people might have. In the first part you will see people who struggle for survival, then richness with different problems and in the third part a broken man. But there is one thing that brings them all together, the plain force of love and one car accident. I loved every minute of that movie and I think it is a must seen. The movie is sometimes compared to Pulp Fiction, but I don't think that both movies are comparable. Amores Perros shows violence as plain and simple as it is, and in Pulp Fiction Violence is shown in a somewhat aesthetic way.",

271,22 October 2001,jsoell,10, Difficult to watch at times but intense with a interesting depth of emotion,"I watched this movie as an extra credit assignment for my Spanish course, and it violently broke off a piece of itself inside my head.  I have just purchased the DVD and plan to watch it with as many of my friends as possible because the reactions of the people I watched it with originally were varied to the point that I was unsure if we'd been watching the same movie. The intensity is augmented by the grainy footage and sense of speed (especially apparent in the opening scene).  Also the way in which the director dealt with time and space worked beautifully.  The characters are surprisingly profound, and even the dogs seem to develop as characters (maybe it's just that I have a rottweiler).  All in all a worthwhile if difficult film from a young talented director",

In this painful to watch film (I cried a lot), full of human heartlessness, egotism and cruelty, only the dogs manifested redeeming qualities of devotion, heart, bravery and focus. At first, I kind of liked the character, El Chivo; as he seemed politically and socially idealistic as well as to really love his dogs; but ultimately, he showed himself to be angry, selfish and weak. The reason I watched Amores Perros until the bitter end, was that I sensed Inarritu, the director, was himself suffering with the revelation of human cruelty and I admired his dedication to telling the truth.

276,24 May 2001,mrpmosh,10, LIKE IT OR NOT THIS MOVIE IS OUTSTANDING,"Amores Perros, the directorial debut for Alejandro Iñarritu is one outstanding movie.  It may be hard to swallow for people who are not aware of some of the cruel realities of our world and people who are bad at reading subtitles.  The movie starts fast and exciting and it remains like that throughout.  The characters of the three stories may have problems and not be very likeable but like it or not most of us have our imperfections and are not liked by all.  The stories are very simple yet compelling. Specially the third one with 'El Chivo'.  The violence maybe maybe too much for some but they have to realize that it is not at all exaggerated or glamourized.  The fact that the director shows this violence doesn't mean he enjoys it. He is merely using it as the backdrop for our 'love stories' that show the bad aspects of love.  The tag line 'If you don't see this movie, don't worry, you'll live it anyway' stands.  Unlike some stupid dolt who posted a review here and took the tag line too literally,  most of us can recognize the basic dilemas:  loving someone else's partner, loving someone who will never love you, being in a superficial relationship, having to leave your family for something that you may know is wrong, trying to fix the world and realizing you can't. If some still don't believe such violence is real, and that people do fight dogs, people do rob banks, stab others, go to guerillas and shed blood by the bucket in fatal car  accidents, then read the following example which is directly related to the movie.  In an interview, the director told a story about how him and his crew were assaulted by a juvenile gang just outside the house where they held the dogfights who claimed they were filming in their territory.  The crew decided to call in security guards who know how to talk to gangs because if they had called the cops, the gang would have killed them and the cops.  In the end the guards found out that the gang claimed they where filming in their turf and that all they had to do was ask their permission.  The crew asked and the gang granted it, no money down.  Maybe in the US and Canada one is not as related with this type of behavior and may be led to believe that the director was just glamourizing.  Well, I have lived in Mexico City and I have seen much worse things in the biggest and most violent city in the world. Back to the movie, the story is excellent, the characters may not be likeable but are entirely real, the acting is the best I've ever seen, specially by 'El Chivo',  and the technique is superb.  Forget comparisons to Pulp Fiction this movie stands on its own and it's more creative.  If you haven't seen this movie, then go. If you have and didn't like it then just tell me this: most people liked it, thus the 8.5 rating (which I believe should be higher) do you, in your small little world, honestly think you are right and everybody else is wrong? Its okay if you don't like it but just think about it, go see it again and actually read the subtitles. P.S. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was much inferior to this movie and it didn't deserve to win the Oscar.  Amores Perros all the way!!!! (like it or not.)",

The stories of which the movie consists are linked gloriously but somehow these stories are not so shocking. I don't want to spoil the movie by giving details here but bitter love stories are usually way more painful than these (""Chasing Amy"" is a great example of this). For a film which is based on a brilliant idea of combined stories about love and dogs, i would expect more bitter stories but the only bitter thing was the dog corpses seen anytime on the movie. To conclude, it's a pity that ""Amores Perros"" is not capable of being a classic though it has the capacity to be.",

This is a film not for dog lovers, but for Tarantino fans. It has pure violence and gore, but unfortunately the dog fights don't show ""much"" and what I mean by that is that every time 2 dogs fight we only see the moment they attack each other, which lasts around 5 secs. The three stories are very well written, with strong language and a lot of blood.

The cinematography  and camera work by Rodrigo Prieto is awesome, the production design by Brigitte Broch perfect, the direction excellent, the music great. Technically dazzling.  The animal training is probably the best I've ever seen, unless a lot of dogs died during the making of this movie ;).  However, I felt that the writing was a weak spot.  It was effective, and in some moments, even inspired, but not particularly rich or nuanced.  And if only the episode of Richi the dog would have been shorter... it went on too long.  Yet Amores Perros is a richly rewarding experience. Its darkness is extremely refreshing. It has a strong point of view that does not pander to the audience and it sticks with it to the end. The audience may be discomforted by the rawness of this movie but if you stick with it, you will be moved by it. Felicidades Negro!  Si lees esto por favor mandame un e-mail que tengo algo para ti.",

290,15 April 2002,OzoFriendly,8, Tough Love,"While I think I see where Liddle is coming from on one or two points, I think she takes herself way too seriously and overstates the case for political commentary. Seems to me that just about every artist coming out of South America has been raised on a shield on the grounds that their art was the voicebox for their generation's political angst. I prefer to believe that in parts of the world that are hotbeds for activism - and specifically where there is a dense population with a marked class divide, all those qualities that are picked out as deliberate efforts to make a political statement are actually just part of the social geography. We might wonder at the abjection during the first story and rue its contrast to the affluence of the second, but at the end of it all, the characters were all caught in circumstances that had little to do with politics and almost everything to do with emotional consequences. Amores Perros wasn't making a point, in my opinion, it was just telling three different stories about tough love in Mexico and linking them and telling them very cleverly.",

The ideas and tone were very similar to director Inarritu's more recent ""21 Grams"", but I found this film to be more masterfully executed and more personally touching.  Each story line and character were so carefully drawn that I remained mesmerized as I experienced the overlapping and out of order narrative.  I also felt as though I had been transported to worlds-within-a-world that I had never experienced before.  The story is filled with infinite sadness, but leaves one with the feeling of true life authenticity, of having touched some things personal in my own life.  Days after seeing the film, my mind is still filled with vivid images and my heart aches from the emotions.  This is one of the few films I would give a solid 10.

A master's hand is felt in all details, in a way the plot is going on, in the director's choice of colors, in all.. The movie is not very original as it has some allusions with Kitano's Dolls (especially the second novel about a model), with Tarantino's Pulp fiction (in the way the novels are connected with each other - this time mosaic, heroes not familiar with each other but influence on each other's lives - many reminders).

The first story of the movie is brilliant and beautifully crafted, every scene has the necessary elements that take you right into the other. But after the first act, the story begins to drop...and it drops fast. I think it was Hitchcock that said: ""The length of a movie should be relative to the size of the human bladder."" Taking this into consideration, I Think ""El Negro"" (Alejandro Gonzalez) has a bladder the size of Manhattan. Personally, and I read the script before the movie came out, I think that act 2 is weak, with a very weak plot, act 3 is very good, but unfortunately too long. I want to make clear that these were my exact comments when I read the script, when I finally had the opportunity to see the movie I understood what Alejandro was trying to do...bring closure to the whole thing. But with a third act that lasts 45 minutes I think the overall story structure suffers. But that is just my personal opinion (I think Goldman and McKee might agree with me), this doesn't mean the movie is bad...au contraire! I think it is one of the best films done in Mexico in the past decade. I will put it up there with Dos Crimenes and Danzon.

All the characters are constantly looking for something, this kind of  loneliness, sadness and  strong action is something you find travelling in Mexico. The class of super-rich people who  CRASHES with the two guys from very poor families, the constant aim to get a lot of money and get out of the s**t, the genuine sound track (taken from local music bands) that reflects the ultimate styles... I feel this movie will open a new school of cinema in Mexico, sort of realism. I find lot of similarities with the style of the movie Black Cat, White Cat from Emir Kusturica.

306,9 January 2002,rowrulz,8, A very strong Mexican film,"This is a very good film to go and see at the Cinema.  It was the first time I've seen a film quite like this and when I realised there were going to be sub-titles I was a bit disappointed.  I'd never watched a film with sub-titles before.  Despite this, I found the film thoroughly enjoyable for the most part. In parts it is shockingly violent and yet is full of dark humour.  The acting was great and some of the camera work was pretty nifty as well. The film is basically in three parts.  The first is perhaps the most violent and is probably my favourite.  The second is arguably the weakest and yet has a couple of laugh-out moments and is very tragic.  The third is very intriguing and basically brings the story together. In conclusion, I would definitely reccommend this film to people who would like to see something gritty, darkly amusing and completely non-Hollywood-like.",

Living in Mexico, I can say I saw it almost before everybody (except maybe the people who saw it at Cannes Festival). I've seen it 4 times at date (2 at the movie theater). And I keep saying the same. It's a GOOD DAMN TERRIFIC MOVIE. Maybe ""latin"" cultures (people always try to make a difference between people) are a lot different from english-speakers one. But I think this movie is indeed an international masterpiece that can be enjoyed by everybody. I've seen some reviews, and a lot goes straight to the ""violence"" issue, or the ""Dog's cruelty"" one. FIRST OF ALL, Mexico is not a cannibal paradise, so it's ABSOLUTELY STUPID to think that the dogs are, indeed, forced to hurt themselves to make it ""reallistic"". SECOND, THIS IS NOT A COMERCIAL HOLLYWOOD MOVIE. If you watched it and didn´t liked it because you thought so, sorry, but I understand your dissapointment. AMORES PERROS (It's litteral translation isn't ""Love's a bitch"", but ""Cruel love's stories""... a spanish word puzzle) it's not a masterpiece just because it's in a ""Foreign language"" for non-spanish speakers, but it is because its HUGE EMOTIONAL CONTENT. It's not a movie for cheering you up. It's not a DISNEY'S OPTIMISTIC MOVIE. It's a sad movie, in fact. But it is great because it reflects life. People use to think about a movie as an exagerated and beautiful reflect of life. It's OBVIOUS a Spielberg movies is not a reallistic story about life. Amores Perros isn't, in fact, a documentary. But it reflects the sordid and cruel image of life. And it does it with an absolute precision. I can understand a lot of people could not like it, but say it's a bad movie is to denny a masterful management of opposite emotions, wishes, dreams, and a part of human nature. The three stories reflects a frustrated wish of redemption, but powerfull as almost no movie ever.",

But in the way that ""PF"" was a mish-mash of characters loosely binded together with harsh language and larger-than-life visuals, ""Amores Perros"" holds the viwers'attention with a fantastic dialogue and impeccable acting.

I could not help but continuously think of the words ""Betrayal"" and ""Hatred"" as every character in the movie seems to betray or has been betrayed by someone else. The acting is superb, the action riveting, and the 'erotic' scenes between brother and brother's wife titillating if not downright sort of ""tabooishly engaging"".

For me , the director of the film has done his work excellent, especially when you know that this is one of his first films ever, he brings everything in screen on a very high level. The only thing that's a bit strange in certain scenes are the flash backs and flash forwards ( this happens especially with the car accident that you see three times, but every time through the eyes of another person) Conclusion: A very good film which is highly recommended to see!

It's just that throughout the film you would never come to relate to him as the good guy, nor with the bad guys as being the bad guys. And that is the beauty of this film: it lures you into relating with people, such that you see the world through their own eyes, and understand how they perceive their actions as being right.

The performances are poignant in each of The characters, especially in the story of the ""Goat"" which is Capable of provoking fear and tenderness at the same time. The story that Could say that is the least attractive, would be the Spanish woman But that of Gael Garcia Bernal is touching and sad, as much as the Of the Goat.

329,16 October 2000,aholes,7," Although very well done, the cinema of sadism is objectionable","One could perhaps call the type of cinema thoroughly represented by ""Amores Perros"" as the cinema of sadism. Yes, the film is very effective, it is deftly acted, photographed and constructed, and most of its production is first rate. The script, with a few slips due to overreach--in this case one might one say overkill--is engaging. Yet, I have artistic objections to a director that sets out, as aggressively as he can, to shock me, and that is monotonous and repetitive in that fierce pursuit. Nowhere does he permit poetic, lyric, or humorous relief to change and modulate the tone. His only other resource is mild melodrama, when the dejected killer cries to his lost daughter over the phone. Not enough, and not by a long shot. Compared to its most famous predecessor, ""Los Olvidados"" by Luis Buñuel, ""Amores Perros"" leaves quite a lot to be desired. Buñuel could be cruel, but his humor and lyricism were superb. In Latin America, and specially in Colombia, my country, we see blood all the time in television newscasts. Awful things happen here, yes, (as well as in Sweden occasionally), but realism proves in this case to be a bad aesthetic convention. It permits no catharsis. I rated it with a 7. ""Los Olvidados"" would get a 9 or a 10.",

The term ""perro"" although it literally means dog, in Mexico it is used to depict a tough situation or to describe a ruthless person. This is a reoccurring theme throughout the movie as every character faces corrupt people or difficult situations which give the audience a sense that at least in the movie story, life is indeed a bitch.

Three interrelated tales of the darker side of life in contemporary Mexico City, each one as fresh and as fascinating as the last. Each of the three stories are dark, disturbing and filled with humanity. Superbly acted all round, but especially noteworthy is the standout performance by Emilio Echevarria as El Chivo, a political dissident turned hitman, and if the charismatic Gael Garcia Bernal (Octavia, the lovesick dog fighter) isn't an international star in the making I'll eat my words. This brilliant movie shows up the mediocrity of most current Hollywood ""product"", and to my mind ranks with a small handful of movies made this decade ('Chopper', 'The Pledge', 'The Way Of The Gun') that are truly memorable and with genuine substance.

This scene is shot from the point of view of a dog being walked into the arena. We see the blood all over the floor, dogs in crates, dogs with blood on them, and a dead dog being dragged away.

It gives it audience an inside view of the corruption and the life's of different people that live in Mexico. The translation of the title Amores perro's would be funny which is dogs love but then again translated in a different meaning it would be Life's a bitch. Very interesting title one would think. I feel like the movie is not only about how life a bitch but through several characters in the film but we get to experience how people in different classes live. If you actually pay attention closely, all the characters, in the film have dogs, as pets. Which, to me, tells me, why perhaps the tile is what it is AMORES PERROS. A dog's life is pretty simple but compare to a persons, it complicated and I feel like having both together it helps balance out each other out. Even though each of the characters has a certain problem, they always have their dogs to which they turn to comfort. Another thing I noticed was that even though the dogs were never in the best conditions, they never turn against their owners. Although like people they turn against their own kind, which make it another main plot in the film. Throughout the movie we see how these characters, instead of turning to their love ones in tough circumstance, they stab each other in the back, and for example Octavio falls for Susan his brother wife and then turn against him. Secondly Valeria falls for a man that is taken and he return against his wife and children. Finally we have Chivo who paid to kill a business man whom later we discover that his own brother is who wants him dead. We live in a world where people have no limit to their own selfishness to achieve one own personal goal.
