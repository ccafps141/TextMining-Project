0,1 March 2018,chaswe-28402,10, Marvellous Ending,"The message of this film is that there is no symmetry to life. What goes around does not come around. The fall of the coin has no bearing on the way the cookie crumbles. There is no right or wrong to the fates of men. No justice. Opportunities seized may lead on to fortune, but they could just as well lead on to dusty death. Only children expect things to be fair. As things once were they need no longer be. Now that IMDb has decided to list reviews by date there is a slightly increased possibility that this effort will be read by someone. Performance reviews are absolutely not read by me for helpfulness, but for interest and entertainment.",/
1,12 January 2010,Hitchcoc,9, How Much Violence Can You Handle?,"This film grabs you and doesn't let go. There is so much tension and so much pain and so much death. I can think of a more despicable villain in my movie viewing past. This is a stretch for me because I am really tired of gratuitous violence. The scenes here are so graphic and fast paced, deaths of innocents and perhaps, the deserving. I guess I should read the book for some insights. The grim reaper is around the corner and he has an air compressor not a scythe. I'm curious to see what other things Bardem has done. He is certainly a presence. Of all the scenes that will stay with me, the one at the hole in the wall gas station when the first coin is flipped is the most intense. There has been so much commentary. All I can say is it was like watching an accident; you can't take your eyes off it.",r
2,9 September 2020,FLASHP01NT,8, No Country For Old Men - Explanation - Spoilers,"The meaning of Sheriff Bell's dream was that he was ashamed of himself because his fear of death prevented him from doing his duty.
In other words: Ed knew the criminal was in the motel room, but his fear of death prevented him from doing his job, which, in this case, was to die honorably in the line of duty.",e
3,20 June 2013,Sonic_Ocean,10, A Look into an Abyss,"I expect a film like 'No Country for Old Men' to be polarizing for some, especially if they're expecting a big finale with the good guy and the bad guy drawing their guns in the end to settle the score. 'No Country for Old Men' is a film that dabbles more in existentialism, despite all the crime that occurs. Basically, what I'm saying is that the film adapted from the novel is very unconventional not only for its genre, but also in its approach to storytelling. What the Coen brothers do best is combining altogether different elements and creating something with its own unique character. While there are subtle throwbacks to the old wild west, the story takes place in modern society where technology has advanced, society has advanced and unfortunately crime has too.",v
4,13 July 2008,Lechuguilla,9, Some Interesting Characters,"While on a hunting trip, a sportsman (Josh Brolin) finds dead men and a stash of cash in the remote back country of West Texas, the result of a drug deal gone wrong. The greedy hunter takes the cash, but soon discovers that the resourceful criminal responsible for the drug deal, an outlaw named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), has a way of tracking the loot. The hunter thus finds that he is the hunted. Meanwhile, an aging Texas sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is after both the sportsman and Chigurh. The story is set in the early 1980s.",i
5,9 February 2013,Hey_Sweden,8, What's the most money you ever lost on a coin toss?,"Opinions do look to be sharply divided on this typically interesting effort for the Coen brothers. Some hail it a masterpiece, others don't see the appeal at all. While this viewer doesn't quite fit into the former camp, he will say that it's one of the more unconventional examples of crime fiction that one is likely to see. It's much more of a character piece than anything, with some grisly scenes of violence here and there. Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, it centres around three characters, one being a poor hunter named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who one day stumbles into the aftermath of some drug deal gone horribly wrong. He finds $2 million on the scene and impulsively decides to keep the money for himself, while a mysterious, creepy, sadistic stranger named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) tracks him down, porting a unique pressurized air weapon. Somewhat involved is a weary Texas sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who's unsettled by what he sees as the changing times. Now, granted, what's going to test the patience of some of the viewers are some of the monologues; this isn't for people who want a straightforward story and who are turned off by philosophical musings. One can hardly fail to notice how low key most of this narrative is; even in the more intense scenes there's never really a sense of urgency. On the plus side, what we do get are some excellent character moments from the solid star trio of Brolin, Bardem, and Jones. The supporting cast is equally impressive - Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, Garret Dillahunt, Tess Harper, Barry Corbin, Stephen Root, and Beth Grant. The Coens work with some of their reliable prior collaborators such as composer Carter Burwell and cinematographer Roger Deakins. All things considered, ""No Country for Old Men"" may not be to all tastes, and does require some patience on the part of the viewer. It also doesn't resolve itself in the way one might expect for this genre, and might prove to be less than satisfactory in this regard for some of those watching. There's one fantastic confrontation near the end, but the film closes, curiously enough, after a monologue by Bell about a dream he's had. How much or how little all of this works will be up to the individual viewer. In any event, the actors are all fantastic, especially Bardem, and they make the journey worthwhile. Eight out of 10.",e
6,10 February 2008,Robert_duder,7," Over-analyzed and over appreciated, it starts out being one thing and then goes off into another world","People who watch these critical darlings really amuse me. They use words like ""hauntingly flawed"" or ""beautiful and haunting"" or ""stayed with me for days."" No Country For Old Men, at least the first hour and a half is main stream, well done, captivating, gory drama, thriller, action western and then the last half hour takes the film into this queer, nonsensical, blathering of artistic garbage that only someone who pretends to understand would care about. I do understand where they are trying to go with the film...the moral is...times have changed. Was that so hard to say? Instead they create an entire character, use a first class actor to portray him who does little to nothing in the entire film because artistically he's ""washed up and tired of the world."" It doesn't come across like that at all. The infamous Coen Brothers drop this interesting thriller/drama on you with this in depth creation of a serial killer who is just completely hell bent and disturbing and then they toss the entire story away on a disgustingly stupid and boring ending never giving closure to anything that they set up prior. I almost wonder if they did it on purpose as some sort of a cruel joke. I mean it feels like they got to a certain point in the film where they should have ended it but decided, 'no let's tack another 45 minutes on it but just ram whatever we come up with on to it.' As one IMDb reviewer pointed out...it feels tacked on and like a completely different movie. ",w
7,9 November 2007,Quinoa1984,10, You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair.,"No Country for Old Men is as exceptional a mix of two creative talents- the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen, and author Cormac McCarthy (recent winner of the Pulitzer for The Road, his own masterpiece) as one could imagine, as they converge on a story that in lessor hands would be just a B movie. The story concerns an average Joe out hunting one day in Texas who comes across a bunch of dead bodies, heroin, and a satchel with 2 million in cash. He takes it, but without knowing that a true embodiment of a psychopath (Javier Bardem) is on his trail, and as he evades him it becomes more and more clear the fatalism that lies in store, as a weathered sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) is also on the trail with perpetulally sad eyes looking on from his stolid demeanor.

10,6 January 2008,poe426,6, The operation was a success...,"One of Hitchcock's tenets of good Cinema was that the filmmaker must never cheat the moviegoer; must never leave the audience wanting. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN does just that, repeatedly. While the technical aspects are topnotch all around, the telling of the story leaves more than just a little to be desired. Resolution? Yeah, right. Wonky Woody Harrelson's 'baccer-chewin' cowpoke stands out like a sore thumb in such close proximity as it is to so many so much better, and Brolin literally falls by the wayside in one of the lamest twists I do believe I've ever witnessed in a major motion pitcher. (Hitchcockian only in the PSYCHO sense, it's one of the major reasons I rate this one no higher than a six on the scale of one to ten.) Tommy Lee Jones is great, but being sidelined as he is makes his performance little more than incidental.",2
11,16 December 2007,Danusha_Goska,1, Despicable Snuff Film with Pseudo-Intellectual Pretensions,"""No Country for Old Men"" is for the kind of film fan who remarks, ""Gee, wasn't that murder a clever mise-en-scene?"" and who asks, ""What kind of lens do you think they used in that strangulation shot?"" The skeleton of ""No Country for Old Men"" is a cheap, 78-minute, gun-monster-chase B movie. Javier Bardem plays Anton Chigurh, the monster. He is Frankenstein; he is Max Cady from ""Cape Fear;"" he is from your childhood nightmares. He may be death personified.",0
12,4 March 2008,littlemartinarocena,10, Tangible Fear As Art,"I don't remember being so scared in a movie theater since ""Don't Look Now"" Here the Coen Brothers take everything a step further with exhilarating ease. The terror was genuine and not because we were rooting for Josh Brolin or anybody in particular. The terror was personal, Joel and Ethan Coen made that terror visceral and tangible. It has to do with our own nightmares. Josh Brolin was a perfect piece of casting because in a way he doesn't have many personal colors. He's one of the bunch, one of us and we could put ourselves in his shoes. That is the art of film narrative expressed in a way that we've never experienced before. I heard people old enough to have seen Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" in the theaters and what glued them to the screen was their own fear. Well, that's what I've experienced here. Javier Bardem is superb, considering that he's the reason for the fear. He carries a human/inhuman kind of strength and we know he'll get us, sooner or later and if we consider the ending of the film, he might still do. Worthy Oscar winners, all of it and all of them.",0
13,25 December 2007,howardeisman,5, Ruined by it's last half hour,"This was an exciting chase/suspense/character movie until about the half way mark. At that point, too much was going on, all of it similar and all of it almost beyond comprehension. There seemed to an endless supply of Mexican drug runners be to killed. Where they came from, with whom they were affiliated, what they were trying to do, were all insufficiently explicated-if at all. The end of the movie is, IMHO, just a disintegration-as if all the money or film stock ran out. Some attempt is made to present the point that this film is an existential exercise showing what I would call nickle and dime existentialism.",6

He returns to the desert that night, and is shot by the criminals. They have his car and he expects them to come after him. He sends his wife away while he tries to hide the $2 million.

16,29 February 2008,majikstl,3, No answers to key questions,"When some movies are over, everything is tied up in a neat little package; for better or worse, someone worked really hard to make sure there were no unanswered questions. Other movies aren't so considerate. Others may be messy, but the good ones leave you asking key questions about the philosophy of the story. They may make you wonder ""What would I do in that situation?"" ""Was the hero really a hero?"" ""Do I agree with the film's moral?"" etc. These films draw you into the story, to the point where the ending is really the beginning of the film's lasting power. Sometimes messy is good.",9

19,27 September 2011,TheLittleSongbird,9," A masterpiece, albeit a flawed one","No Country for Old Men is not necessarily the Coen Brothers' best movie, I consider Barton Fink, Fargo, Miller's Crossing and The Big Lebowski better. However it is a great movie, I'd go as far to say it is my definition of a flawed masterpiece(the only other movie I've given that definition to is The Magnificent Ambersons). So why do I call it a flawed masterpiece rather than a masterpiece full stop? Well actually right up to the last twenty minutes, the film was the latter rather than the former. If the last twenty minutes had not felt like a completely different movie, it would've stayed like that. As is the case with all the Coen Brothers' movies, No Country for Old Men is very well made with impressive cinematography, editing and settings. The story is compelling, the direction superb and the script most of the time taut, funny, thrilling and exciting. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are excellent in this film, but if I have to give an award to best performance of the film, it would be Javier Bardem in a villainous role that is menacing and chillingly effective. Overall, a great movie but due to the final twenty minutes it just loses out to that extra something. 9/10 Bethany Cox",r

22,7 November 2015,Horst_In_Translation,8, Gritty edge-of-seat from start to finish,"""No Country for Old Men"" is the Coen Bros' adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel from almost 10 years ago. This film won 4 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and while I have doubts to say this is my favorite film of the year and not ""There Will Be Blood"", there is no denying that ""No Country for Old Men"" is among the finest the year 2007 had to offer. The movie runs for slightly over 2 hours, with credits, and takes us into the world of Llewelyn Moss who finds a huge amount of money. For almost the entire movie, he is on the run from contract killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem, Oscar winner) with Tommy Lee Jones playing Ed Tom Bell, a sheriff who, on the other hand, is trying to help Moss and catch Chigurh. Woody Harrelson and Kelly McDonald play important characters too.",_
23,17 April 2014,Mr-Fusion,7, Makes an indelible mark. Not to be soon forgotten.,"It doesn't tend to come up when I think of crime movies, but ""No Country for Old Men"" is a great one. It's got that slow and methodical predator-stalking-his-prey tempo, and the movie's populated with some great characters. Anton Chigurh is surely one of the creepiest bad guys I've ever laid eyes on (the cattle gun is novel, and the sound of that shotgun!); Bardem ratchets the creepiness of that guy to unbelievable heights. Conversely, Brolin's outlaw has got to be one of the dumbest. He proves himself a wily criminal, but drug money always has someone coming for it. Not bright.",=
24,2 March 2008,phenomynouss,1, Wasn't that good,"I was not biased against the film when I saw it.

Fargo, had its quirky character and its grotesque moments, but this film is all about a subdued natured intermixed with quick action. For what I expected, I got some of it, but also a bit more of a subdued air and timing than I expected. It would do things in spurts, action at the beginning then a lull and more thunder. It worked great for keeping one on edge, which Brolin did, excellently in the lead role lying awake thinking too hard.

I just saw this with my friend this afternoon and I was blown away. It's a little odd because this did not seem like a typical movie that I would love, but the performances were absolutely flawless and the writing was brilliant. My friend just kept saying how horrible it was, but I don't think some people are going to understand how great this movie really is or need to see it again to understand it. I was never really a fan of the Coen Brothers and their work, but the reason why I loved this movie is due to the fact that it points out the violence in the world and how far people will go to get money or drugs.

I think the way the directors executed the movie in such a philosophical and realistic way was brilliant. The fact that there wasn't any musical score throughout proves that you don't even need a haunting score to make such a good thriller film. Ironically, I think it was better that it did not have a score. It just felt more thrilling and suspenseful to watch. Javier Bardem's performance was one for the books. His portrayal as a notorious murderer and sociopath roaming around and his chase scenes with Josh Brolin's character was something I'd never get tired of watching over and over again.",

Adding other dimensions there is aging sheriff trying to help hero without his knowledge. The movie starts and flows like a clean water with edgy characters, tricky situations and some clever ideas. Then when you are all set for bang-bang climax, movie takes a different route, plot becomes ambiguous, motives become unclear and our hero is out of the story just like that.

It just sputters along with stabs of pointless violence and splashes of awkward humor that are mostly based on casting ugly people and then making them sound stupid. The bad guy is Freddy Kruger with a Prince Valiant haircut, Tommy Lee Jones is wasted, Woody Harrelson is (pardon) wasted, a lot of really nice scenery is wasted.

And I've seen a lot of boring movies. It sacrifices entertainment value for moral, and as far as moral goes . . .",

Sure, the movie is seen from 3 characters' POV, but the central focus is supposed to be on Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) an underused and uninvolved character, and extremely awkward to the indisputably gripping premise.",
54,1 January 2008,Killa42,1, Not close to copper!,"No spoilers here Until the last half hour this looked like possibly one of the greatest films ever made. Then, the storm came and washed that idea away for me. I understood the symbolism of evil and all. But, for a movie that tried to be realistic, it failed to do so. For one thing it had some under qualified rambling sheriff played by Jones chasing the antagonist he barley tried, gave up fast, and mostly sipped on coffee. The psycho killed several along his journey and yet no one contacted the FBI which is protocol for escaped serial killers.",
55,13 December 2007,shark-43,6, Flip A Coin,"I am a fan of the Coen Brothers(Raising Arizona, Fargo, Barton Fink, Big Lebowski and Blood Simple) and yet I have also sat through films of theirs that just didn't work -- even with entertaining moments -- (Hudsucker Proxy, Miller's Crossing, O' Brother, etc.) - so I went in thinking I was just going to love this new one - especially with all the rave reviews in the press and I was with it - really enjoying it - until the shootout in the El Paso Motel room - from that moment on I felt the movie was off the rails and in the ravine. The acting is excellent - the cinematography is brilliant, but overall - I was disappointed with the final act. I understand the Coens were very faithful to the book (which is to be commended yet there are times one has to realize you are visually telling a story) but maybe they were TOO faithful. I'm not one of these viewers who needs things explained or wants everything tied up in a ribbon - but to invest so much time in Brolin's character and then not even SEE his demise - well that just ticked me off. And I also felt that once Brolin found the money (which is a good plot point for dozens and dozens of crime films) the movie just kind off moved from one bit to another - some of them amazing but some of them bland and one-note. The scene with Bardem messing with the old timer who runs the gas station is one of the best, most tension-filled scenes I have ever watched - brilliantly acted, written and edited. Bardem (who is so damn good in Night Must Fall), Brolin and the rest of the cast are terrific - I loved Tommy Lee Jones' opening narration but I must be in the minority in not liking his little speech about his dreams at the end. I think it's a good film, a flawed film but not a great film.",

I cannot believe the critics gave this a good review, nor can I believe the users are giving it such a high score. Towards the end, there are some characters that come into the movie, then disappear, and you have no idea who they are or why they are in the movie.

58,26 November 2022,CinemaSerf,7, No Country for Old Men,"Javier Bardem is just great in this! He is ""Anton"", a ruthlessly efficient killer on the hunt for a missing bag of loot that has fallen into the hands of the opportunistic ""Moss"" (Josh Brolin) after a drug deal goes awry. The latter man soon cottons onto the fact that his life is now considerably more at risk and he has to figure just out how to survive long enough to escape and enjoy his cash. ""Moss"" might just have an unlikely and unwitting ally, though, in the form of the pursuing but rather unenthusiastic sheriff ""Bell"" (Tommy Lee Jones) but, well you just wouldn't want to bet against the truly menacing Bardem! It's violent and brutal, sure - but it's also darkly humorous with plenty of pithy banter and quite some degree of characterisation from both Brolin and Bardem as the denouement looms large. That conclusion is as unpredictable as the rest of this quirkily scary and entertaining crime drama that uses an oxygen cylinder with startlingly effective results in this game of lethal Russian Roulette. Nobody is safe, nobody is innocent - and it doesn't matter whose side you are, ostensibly, on either. It's perfectly paced by the Coen brothers, the characters and the story given ample opportunity to develop and to breathe and by the conclusion I was definitely rooting for someone! It has shades of the old wild-west Texan Western genre to it, it reeks of authenticity and is really well worth a watch.",

It gives me hope that there are some good stories out there being made into film. But this one...I dunno, it was like someone put a lump of cookie dough onto a baking sheet, and the cookie didn't bake. So you're left with a lump of..cookie dough. I got up in the middle of the movie to buy popcorn and a soda, used the restroom just to entertain myself. I NEVER do that at a good movie. I stay planted and aware.

61,20 May 2022,Xarx117,10, A Fantastic Dialog Masterpiece,"This is the Cohen brothers Masterpiece and its an underrated movie. The dialog is extremely good. The quotes are funny, scarry and deep in meaning. The movie is what i could say raw, by the sense that there is hardly any music or emotions but you can tell those emotions if you look close enough in the actors faces. This is probably one of the main reason why some people dont like it, but if i can say to those people a word, i would say stop watching and try to understand the bigger meaning. The way the scenes transit to each other is very special. They cut a scene leaving you to ask questions but they don't answer them. Its a good example that we don't need to know everything in a movie for it to be good. Everything in this movie has hardly never been done anywhere else before. The acting performance is also stunning. The ending powerfully portays how life is not fair and how we should not expect it to be. This is one of the best message transmited trough script in history of films. This is surely one of the best movie script ever written.",
62,4 February 2015,videorama-759-859391,9, A movie that's all country which rocks and rolls,"This is a thoroughly entertaining movie you must put on your bucket list, with one of the most scariest performances from a great actor you'll ever see. The Coen Brothers have done it again with a great structured story. Although the plot is nothing new, it's the way this story is told, only enhanced by the great performance of Bardem as a psychotic contract killer, and I really mean psychotic. Escaping from police, he's after a suitcase of cash, in the wake of a drug buy that's gone wrong, out there in the country, that's left a score of guys dead. Unfortunately, but more unfortunate for Brolin, he's found the money and taken off with it, which again shows stolen moolah is blood moolah. This engrossing film from start to finish has it all, including some great comedy moments, one a trademark one, worth all it's amount in coin. There are some other great performances, notably, Tommy Lee Jones as a cynical and aging old sheriff. The scenes with him are gold, proving he's one of the greatest actors out there. Kelly Macdonald is really good as Brolin's nagging wife, who I must admit, I didn't realize at first. The ending is pretty grim, where seeing bones broken like in the Straw Dogs remake, makes me squirm a little. Too, for the viewer, nearing it's end, a ""Did he shoot her or not"" moment, which would of left a few movie goers ruminating, moments after seeing it. I believe the Coen brothers are incapable of making a bad movie, where to me, nothing they've done would score lower than an 8. This is one of those films, which I secretly refer to as movie candy. I could watch many times, and never be bored. Even the title is great, in a can't take your eyes off the screen movie. One criticism though was how Brolin was able to outrun that pick up truck of bad dudes, after he returned with that canteen of water, but hey all is forgiven. A must watch for everybody.",

70,23 July 2009,zardoz-13,10," Memorable, Chilling Crime Melodrama in the Modern Day Southwest.","""O' Brother, Where Art Thou"" co-directors Joel and Ethan Coen have created another classic melodrama with their quasi-western, road trip crime epic ""No Country for Old Men"" about an inexorable killer and his quest to recover millions in illicit drug money. This art-house saga is a simple, but powerful tale that involves four primary characters and a host of supporting characters. Ostensibly, the narrator, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, spends most of his time dwelling on the psychology of the characters as well as the changing times. ""No Country for Old Men"" isn't your ordinary shoot'em up with cut and dried heroes and villains. The Coens have adapted the Cormac McCarthy novel and retained its pervasive sense of irony. Indeed, the moral universe of ""No Country"" is skewered because the villain survives, the protagonist dies, and the sheriff is so scared that he quits his job. Paid killer Anton Chigurh embodies the essence of pure evil. Despite the fact that he is a flesh & blood character, Chigurh could send shivers up the Terminator's spine because he never gives up. Although the Coens may not realize it, Chigurh resembles another inexorable killer, the Lee Van Cleef gunman called 'Angel Eyes' in director Sergio Leone's ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.""

The true brilliance of ""The big Lebowski"", ""Barton Fink"", ""Fargo"", ""Miller's crossing"" or their debut ""Blood simple"", shows the way to creativity without compromise. On their latest effort ""No country for old man"" I think they lost that path, the same way as with the misfired ""Raising Arizona"", and compromises with the film industry, which brought them Oscar nominations and subsequent Best picture award, are sadly evident in this film. The Coen seal is there but it's broken in several places and that ruined the originality of their trade mark approach.",

The visuals offer some captivating images and there isn't an over abundance of dialogue but plenty of suspense, observation, and mood to keep the proceedings interesting. There is an ample amount of violence and bloodshed in No Country for Old Men, which I guess could be justified by the story, but at the same time not really necessary.

It's a calm and methodical meditation on the changing nature of both crime itself and the world at large (with a focus on America, in particular). It maintains its slow pace even during its bluntly violent action sequences, which are often genuinely intense. The piece is surprisingly suspenseful, providing proper thrills alongside its pseudo philosophical pondering. It doesn't spoon-feed you anything; you have to work to understand its plot and, even, characters, which are both relatively elusive and purposefully amoral. The flick makes no judgements on its players, even though some are truly despicable, and it doesn't provide easy explanations or motivations for some of their actions. This makes for an engaging experience that encourages rather deep thinking. The movie isn't as straightforward as its pretty by-the-numbers set-up would suggest. It undercuts itself at, arguably, its most important moment, subverting expectation with an unconventional yet shockingly effective final third. It really is brilliant. The film feels substantial, a resonant commentary on the ever-evolving yet always cyclical nature of violence and the pure randomness of fate. It stays with you for quite a while after it's over, both providing in-the-moment excitement and provoking retroactive reflection. It's a confident and considered affair right from the start.

90,9 November 2013,l_rawjalaurence,9, Quirky Anti-Western Chase Film,"Based on the Cormac McCarthy novel, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MAN is quite simply a joy to watch, as it continually frustrates our expectations of what kind of movie it is expected to be. Set in Texas, New Mexico and Mexico itself, it is a western that isn't a western; a chase film in which bad guy Anton Chigurh (Javier Badem) pursues Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), while being himself pursued by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones). One of those chases is resolved; the other is left hanging in the air. The film builds up a fair amount of suspense, as we wonder whether Chigurh and Bell are going to get their men, yet the Coen Brothers continually combine that suspense with an eye for telling detail, or the inclusion of quirky sequences designed to show the futility of the entire quest theme. One of my favorite quirky sequences takes place in a dirty roadside motel, where the camera cuts to a sign outside saying (""HBO Available""). The whole notion of cable television in this kind of motel seems particularly incongruous. The performances are simply brilliant: Bardem doesn't have a lot to say, but communicates everything through telling glances. By contrast Brolin seems more laid back, despite the fact that he is being continually pursued. Jones goes through the motions of ensuring that justice should be done, but seems to be looking for a quiet life all the time. It is significant that the dramatic tension slackens somewhat during his sequences. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is the kind of movie that befits repeated viewings in order to uncover its subtleties.

In many instances that could make for some infuriating viewing, but in the Coen brothers' hands it all somehow comes together into a master tapestry. The word of the day is suspense, an emotion the brothers have excelled at in the past, and No Country is a glorious example of it at play. The film's three protagonists, retiring sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), stone-cold killer Chigurh (a terrifying, star-making turn for Javier Bardem) and land-living cowboy Moss (Josh Brolin), never actually meet face-to-face but the wake of ripples left in their dueling pursuits is enough to power several movies' worth of rich, intriguing material.

The movie begins and ends with Jones narration. In the opening narrative he tells the story of a boy he sent to the electric chair who had killed his 14 year old girlfriend for no apparent reason. This narration sets the tone for the entire movie as we are introduced to Anton, a evil man who kills without hessitation. The abrupt ending has a lot to do with what Jones has been saying since the beginning of the movie.

104,8 March 2010,Sandcooler,9, Unconventional but highly effective thriller,"This movie took a while to really get into, but once I did I was pretty overwhelmed. It isn't a classic fight between the good and the bad, it's more like a brilliant cat-and-mouse game between the unlikeable and the even more unlikeable. I felt bad for Llewellyn Moss, who had no idea about how far over his head he was, but he's mostly the hero because of the contrast with Anton Chigurh. Chigurh is the unstoppable evil, which is mainly apparent in the gas station scene, in which he decides the clerk's fate in a coin toss. It's so random, it has nothing to do with the main plot, but he wants to kill him because he can. That's the frightening thing about Chigurh, he does bad things for no reason. It's a brilliant character, and his cold-blooded antics give the movie a breakneck pace. The pseudo-intellectual ending scene is an anti-climax, but that's pretty much the only criticism I can give.",

Kubrick's film has 88 minutes of no dialog. That's like making a feature length film and not having any spoken dialog, and by today's standards (even 1968 standards) that is odd.

It's as if the creators of this movie had decided that they would try to out-do The Mist for the worst ending of an otherwise interesting movie for the year 2007. Also, this movie brings to mind another good movie, The Last King of Scotland, in that how ""Scotland"" shows how a murdering tyrannical dictator isn't such a bad guy, ""No Country"" tries to make the same case for a serial murderer who systematically murders only bad guys. I guess tyrannical dictators and serial killers have their stories too. When trying to dramatize the behavior of seriously mentally deranged persons, such as serial killers, Hollywood sometimes does a good job. Case in point: Taxi Driver, which offers a compelling story about a troubled young man who kills. In Cold Blood is another excellent movie of that genre. This movie does not even come close to those movies in terms of quality or storytelling. Tommy Lee Jones is lost in this movie. He is entirely miscast. The actor who plays the main protagonist, the psychopath who goes around killing, gives a great performance as long as he does not talk, which is not his fault because the dialog is weak. Nevertheles, the movie does have its fascinating features and is watchable but with one caveat: be prepared for is just one weak ending. ",

Had they left the 90's burnt out, it would've been completely understandable. But 10 years ago, they crafted an ingenious comeback by making perhaps the most convincing, powerful film about pure evil in history. No Country for Old Men is one of the greatest films ever made.. but you already knew that. I'm sort of late to catching up to this one and I regret it entirely. Visually speaking, it captures the darkness of our world in ways no film has ever been capable of. In terms of acting, it absolutely soars. Broiln and Jones are incredible. Javier Bardem is terrifying as Anton. He eats at your soul. As far as films that depict serial killers, this is as real as it gets.

I don't think I've ever seen a better example of less is more in a film. It would be a sin not to mention the cinematography. Roger Deakins once again knocks it out of the park with his beautiful frames. He is without a doubt my favorite cinematographer. The acting is superb. Javier Bardem was absolutely terrifying as Anton Chigurh, truly one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones both give the greatest performances of their careers. This film is a masterclass in tension. This is best complemented by the use of silence. There is no music in this film. (Apart from the end credits of course) Which makes for some of the most anxiety-inducing scenes I have ever witnessed. But at it's core, the film is about the inevitably of death and the passing of time. I will not spoil it but this film contains one of the most beautifully ambiguous endings ever, it fully contributes to its themes.

The protagonist, Chigurh, was relentless and you kept hoping he'd get his just desserts in a big way. This was a three-way chase film,, and had its shocking moments. Josh Brolin was excellent as the cowboy type and he carried the film in a big way. I don't know if he was nominated for an Oscar, but he should have been. Tommy Lee Jones's character seemed to epitomize the title of the film. An unforgettable classic. Chigurgh has a haunting presence. A scary, brutal, tense drama that reaches out and grabs you.

I was left with far too many questions in the end to give this film a high rating. I tried to like it, given it's critical reviews, but found portions of it rather boring, and also couldn't figure out how certain characters got involved in the story at all. They often seemingly appeared out of nowhere, leaving you to ponder who they were and what relationship they had to other characters as the movie rolled on. And the ending has been well-documented. I would guess most viewers basically zone out at that point anticipating the next bit of action, and the next bit of action is the credits scrolling by. Fargo and The Big Lebowski remain on top of my Coen Bros. list, with No Country perhaps bringing up the rear.

Attention is paid to all the characters, even minor roles, and the subtle but very true portrayal of different facets of human nature - which is what really carries the movie.

True, they are brilliant, talented, witty, but then so was Goebbels. This is a totally pointless, meandering tour of a seedy corner of Hell. Yes, there are fine performances. Tommy Lee Jones is a perfect joy to watch, his droll manner, his fabulous accent, his presence, are welcome even in such an evil film as this. Kelly MacDonald, who was spellbinding in the excellent TV series 'State of Play' (2003), is compulsively watchable and effective here. If you like convincing portraits of Satan, then by all means give an Oscar to Javier Bardem. Josh Brolin is earnest and convincing. Woody Harrelson is fascinating as always. Everybody is good, but the film is wicked, disgusting, offensive, and should never have been made except perhaps by Hell Productions Inc. The story does not even get anywhere. What is clear is that the voters for Academy Awards who have become so decadent and morally rotten and corrupt as to give this film Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Script, are prepared to glorify pure unadulterated evil on the screen, evil which has no redeeming qualities other than black humour, evil which does discredit to the film industry, corrupts the public, spreads despair, and corrodes the soul. Someone should take the Coen brothers out back and do the right thing, and as for the Academy voters, they should put their heads down the toilet bowl where their taste is to be found, judging from the way they voted, and drink what they evidently crave. Is this what we have come to? Complete, mindless, aimless, decadence? Violence with no point? Psychopaths for breakfast? Are our tastes so jaded that a series of brutal and bloody murders by a madman is all that is left which can titillate us? I say shame on all who made this film, shame on all who voted for it, shame on all who have praised it and given it awards. Do we really wonder how we have now had the Great Worldwide Economic Collapse, when this film and its enthusiastic welcome prove so conclusively that it was preceded by the Great Moral Collapse? All those rogue traders, short-sellers and hedge fund lunatics who are destroying lives by the millions through their greed and immorality are the very same people who watch films like this and love them. This film's success proves that there are no standards or values left. Pardon me while I vomit on screen in glorious technicolor.",

139,12 June 2008,Woodyanders,9, Almost a great movie,"Shrewd, resourceful Vietnam veteran Llewelyn Moss (the excellent Josh Brolin) stumbles across a bunch of dead bodies, a pick-up full of heroin, and a bag with two million bucks worth of drug money in it. Moss decides to take the bag. This in turn makes Moss the target of vicious and remorseless psychopath Anton Chigurh (a splendidly chilling performance by Javier Bardem), who engages in a lethal game of cat and mouse with Moss. Meanwhile, cagey, weary Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (the always fine Tommy Lee Jones) investigates and tries to find Moss before it's too late. Joel and Ethan Coen have expertly crafted a tense, gripping and understated crime thriller that for the most part works like gangbusters: the sterling performances from a sturdy cast, the bleak, fatalistic tone, Roger Deakins' crisp, striking cinematography, the startling outbursts of shockingly brutal violence, several inspired moments of pitch black humor (the scene between Chigurh and a befuddled gas station proprietor is an amusingly edgy little gem), Carter Burwell's spare, moody score, the vivid evocation of the dusty, desolate rural terrain and the everyday folks who inhabit the region, the provocative central theme about a dying code of honor and decency, and a few well-staged action set pieces (a protracted shoot-out between Moss and Chugurh in the empty dark streets of a small town rates as a definite exciting highlight) are all uniformly spot-on. Brolin, Bardem, and Jones all shine in their meaty parts, with Barden especially memorable as one seriously scary and nasty villain. Moreover, there are nice supporting turns by Woody Harrelson as cocky, amiable hoodlum Carson Wells, Kelly McDonald as Moss' sweet, concerned wife Carla Jean, Garret Dillahunt as the eager Deputy Wendell, Tess Harper as Bell's sassy wife Loretta, and Barry Corbin as crusty, crippled old coot Ellis. WARNING: Possible *SPOILERS* ahead. However, the film really falters in the annoyingly vague and meandering last third.

Based on the Cormac McCarthy novel 'No Country' is a return to form for the sibling filmmakers or at least it is for the first hour and a half. What starts off with some amazing cinematography and a Tommy Lee Jones voice-over boils over into a frenzied chase movie that has genuine tension running through its every pore and then sadly it doesn't really have an ending and all the good things that have come before seem somewhat spoilt. Javier Bardem is amazingly creepy as sociopath Anton Chigurh, his hair nearly as bizarre as his favourite method of killing, every line he delivers is unnerving and yet you hang off his every word. Josh Brolin Is great as Llewelyn Moss the Welder turned wanted man after he stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong and steals a case full of money so he and his wife can start a new life. Cue every man and his dog, literally, after Moss from cops to Mexicans and of course Nutcase extraordinaire Anton. There is very little screen time for either Lee Jones or Harrelson and if you blink you could be forgiven for missing either of their performances. There are some beautiful shots, some great lines and a fitting score but it is by no means perfect which is a shame. But for the most part the Coen's flourishes can be seen and there is nearly as much tension and suspense as there is blood but with such a strange ending and so many loose ends like not actually telling the viewer what happened or why I feel they still have some way to go to regain former glories, but this is at least a start.",

It's quite curious that the mass killings by a sophisticated serial killer only garners the attention of one hick small-town sheriff and his staff. What happened to the FBI? Yes the DEA is mentioned but we never see them. What happened to all the media coverage? The serial killers picture would probably have made the national news and he should have been on the FBI's 10 most wanted list but we see none of that. Yes I know it's supposed to be 1980 but still the pursuit of this fugitive would have been a big story. The reason why the Coens don't show that is because they've created a totally unrealistic character that exists totally in their specious imagination. In real life there would have been hundreds of law enforcement agents tracking this guy but we never get a sense of that in this laughable scenario.,

155,13 March 2008,JulzGaye,1, Best Picture of the Year!??,"During the first half to two-thirds of the film, the characters were building, which left one to think this was really going someplace, albeit slowly. Other characters were then added in completely unnecessarily. What was the purpose of the complete waste of time Woody Harrelson!? There were ends left flopping in the breeze that you thought surely would tie down as some point, but never did. The storyline was all over the place. Although you know who kills the main character, the creators of this film didn't see fit to show or explain how that came about, which was an important part of the story. It felt strongly like that scene just wasn't included because it would have been too much trouble and/or expense which was cheesy and lame. Tommy Lee Jones, who you expect to be significant was rarely seen or heard from and was downgraded to some form of powerless hick dreamer. Josh Brolin is very nice to look at but didn't have much of a story to act. His character exhibited some semblance of intelligence but never looked for an electronic tracking device in the loot! The Spaniard, Javier Bardem (Anton) did a decent job of pulling off creepy and I'm sure we'll be seeing much more of him in America. The last scene made me scream - ""This had better not be the end!"" But alas, it was! I have passed the DVD on to friends, but felt the need to be apologetic when I did so. It is astounding that this film got the awards & recognition it did. This rates right up there with Lost in Translation, Eyes Wide Shut, and Monsters Ball. The voters must be pod people.",

161,7 January 2008,rob55-2,1, Does not live up to the hype,"As hard as I try, I cannot figure why this film is getting so much praise and critical acclaim. Part of the reason I watched this film (besides what I had heard from TV ads, the fact that it was directed by the Coen brothers and that it generally looked like an interesting film) was the great rating it had here on IMDb. When the film ended and the credits started to roll, I sat there scratching my head not about confusion over the film, but about how it got an 8.8 rating. Generally speaking, I find that I tend to agree with the ratings that various movies receive here on IMDb, but NCFOM is an exception to this track record. With that said, here are the problems I had with the film. For starters, there is nothing new or novel here, it's all been done before. Innocent bystander finds loot, bad guys want loot back, innocent bystander wants to keep money and runs for his life, innocent bystander gets killed. Next, Sheriff Bell seems to wander aimlessly through the movie always a day behind the protagonist and antagonist(s). Next, how is it that no one sees Chigurh walking around with the oxygen tank as a weapon. Or for that matter, the shotgun with the huge silencer on it. Actually, there were a lot of little things like that which stretched believability. How is it that the guy walking by on the street (immediately after Chigurh lights the gas-soaked rag on the car on the street) doesn't see this flaming rag sticking out of the car. And what's with killing off Moss so unceremoniously? For that matter, why kill off the wife? Finally, the whole dream story by Bell at the end, what a bunch of tripe. Obviously, there are people out there who got much more (real or imagined) out of NCFOM than I did and I guess I'm happy for them. Believe me, I wanted to like this movie, but ultimately, I couldn't get past it's shortcomings.",

166,21 February 2019,ironhorse_iv,8," It's time to call it, friendo for what it is! A cinematic masterpiece.","Based upon, author, Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel of the same name; there is no doubt, 'No Country for Old Men' was an amazing movie. This film written and directed by the Coen Brothers was mostly entertaining from beginning into the end. However, there were some flaws. Such in the case of pacing. This Academy Award-winning best picture crime drama and neo-western really takes its sweet time, telling the story of a disillusion elderly cop, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), having to find & protect an West Texas resident Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) whom recovered stolen drug money in a drug deal gone bad, before a psychotic and sociopathic hitman, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) and the Mexican Cartels get a hold of him. Without spoiling this motion picture masterpiece, too much, while the game of cat & mouse story is a bit slow at parts, mostly in the opening & the subverted your expectations off-screen ending with Moss was a bit annoying. I still love this film. Glad, the Coen Brothers did cut out a few of the unneeded moments from the book, such as Moss picking up a hitchhiker. Nevertheless, most of the scenes, they did left, didn't felt unsatisfying & too scattered during most of the movie. The only one that was a bit bothersome was the swimming pool chat. I really don't get, why that was in the film. Nevertheless, while, the story is not that original, as there is striking similarities regarding the storyline and setting to 1973's crime thriller film 'Charley Varrick' aka 'The Last of the Independents"" directed by Don Siegel & the 1968's novel 'The Looters' by author John H. Reese. One thing, the source material and film does well, is explores the human struggle toward trying to define the frameworks of code of ethics and morality, both within the perspective of the story's heroes and the villains with a minimal use of dialogue. I like how, each of the three main characters, has their own set of ideas of what that can be. Some of them, are very tired of the gruesome violent nature of humanity & struggles to find a moral center within it, to a point that they often abandon their authentic duties, due to being fearful. Others are not, like that; some function in a moral framework given to them by society, either by social norms, family or faith. However, the most chilling character in the film is the one driven by his own internal framework. His actions do not fall either, pragmatism or moral duty. That person operates outside of any sane understanding of morality and ethics, and continually raises conflicting philosophical questions to his victims often with a game of luck and chance with a coin toss. The only thing, he knows, is no matter, what people chose how to live life, death comes to us, all, either fast or slow. In his eyes, we all cattle, that one day, will be slaughter. We all, living pieces of meat. This is his mindset. No wonder, why his choice of weapon, the air powered bolt gun stronger symbolically his views. It's a powerful comparison. The actor, Bardem really did a good job, showing how unpredictable menacing such men can be, by his body language & facial expression, even if his character's haircut is a bit goofy. Glad, he still won Best Supporting Actor at that year's Oscars. As for the other performers, they were just as good, especially Tommy Lee Jones. The delivering of his character's dreams really does hold some emotional weight. It's here, we get hints what the title of the film taken from the opening line of 20th-century Irish poet William Butler Yeats' poem ""Sailing to Byzantium"", means, as he felt really defeated by the harsh ambiguity of this new time and mourns of the loss of the bygone era of decently, even if this ideal world might probably never even existed but has been an illusion, all along. While, this pessimistic somewhat preachy, yet violent ambiguous ending might turn off some viewer from rewatching this movie. I do have to say, the film is worth seeing, regardless. The cinematography alone is amazing. Some of the shots of the West Texas desert is beautiful to look at. Cinematographer, Roger Deakins did a hell of a job, setting up the camera & scenes. However, I wish, the movie had more of a score by composer, Carter Burwell to go with. For me, the minimized of the score leaving large sections devoid of music was a mixed bag. Some parts, the suffocating silence, kinda works like the gas station stop; in other moments, it undermined some of the gripping gory action sequences like the chase scene involving the Pitbulls. Nevertheless, overall heads or tails: the film still fire on nearly all cylinders. This is one motion picture worth checking out. It is a must watch.",
167,25 June 2017,Screen_Blitz,10, The Coen Brothers' nihilistic western thriller inspired on Cormac McCarthy's novel is pure cinematic beauty,"Life in west is violent, at least that is what many cinematic entries in the western genre lead you to believe. Hollywood moguls Joel and Ethan Coen take on the audacious of taking the pages of Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name and spinning it into cinematic proportions. It is significantly difficult feat to pull as McCarthy's sophisticated style of writing have lead many to believe translating his works into films are far too easier said than done. In spite of this, it appears that no one's directing methodology is a suitable match of McCarthy's writing other than the Coen Brothers. In a splendid effort, the masterminds behind such projects as 'Fargo', 'The Big Lebowski', and their debut 'Blood Simple' bring McCarthy's western tale to life in an pure enthralling fashion. It is violent, gory, and unquestionably dark in tone. But beneath the surface is immersive talent of the Coen Brothers who more than effectively uproot a tale of fate, conscious, and perplexing morality. Set in 1980, this film follows Southern Texas native Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin), a retired Vietnam veteran who goes on a hunting trip only to come across a string of dead bodies in what appears to have been a drug deal gone awry. Upon investigating the gruesome scene, he gets a hold of a suitcase containing a few million dollars. While Llewelyn manages to run away with it in attempt to make it to the Texas border, a sadistic sociopath Anton Chigurh (played by Javier Bardem) sets out to retrieve it, leading to a series of grisly murders.

I watched the Seventh Seal after this movie; I connected with this movie's metaphors so much more. I'm not sure if any art can be perfect, but I definitely wouldn't change a thing about this movie.

Since their neo-noirish debut with 'Blood Simple. (1984),' the brother directors have dominated modern cinema with their unique brand of writing and storytelling, evoking the atmosphere of classic films while always maintaining a distinct sense of originality. 'No Country for Old Men (2007)' comes after a somewhat disappointing five-year stretch, during which they produced the second-tier remake, 'The Ladykillers (2003),' and the fun but inconsequential 'Intolerable Cruelty (2004).' Adapting the 2005 novel by Cormac McCarthy, the Coens have created one of the most harrowingly-intense cinema experiences you'll have all year, a cat-and-mouse game of drugs, violence, money and murder that will leave you gasping for air, and clawing at your armrest in search of some comfort.

There are long arias of silence in this movie that are thrilling to experience. You do not notice the lack of dialog in this picture because the images the Coen Brothers create are so entrancing. This is a film of quiet and meditative power. The Coen Brothers confidence in their visual finesse is completely in evidence from the first frame to the last. The last time I saw a crime picture this good I was watching the Coen Brothers masterpiece Blood Simple. This time they have created a sort of tone poem of the American southwest. This film is drenched in blood and chaos but it is filmed so artfully that the work eventually trumps the crime genre itself.

Its structure is very forthright; it's a pleasure to watch the Coens make plot points and connections with something other than dialog; you have to pay attention (but really not even that much) to understand/anticipate the motivation of the next scene. Even respected directors (Scorcese) have become dependent on actors explaining things to make plot points; and been filming talky scripts with little invention.

In this case a Sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones questions the latest string of murders. Josh Brolin plays a hunter who stumbles upon a case full of cash and numerous bodies. His treasure leads to extreme consequences that will cost him. Javier Bardem plays an unusual killer, blasting door locks and asking bizarre questions often contained within a coin toss. Kelly McDonald plays Brolin's wife as fearful yet strong in the face of adversary, which renders a questionable and harsh finale. Woody Harrelson plays a cocky bounty hunter attempting to track down Bardem. The Coen brothers are notorious for bizarre plot ideas, having made such great films as Blood Simple and The Big Lebowski. Jones as the Sheriff transcends a sense of dread and hopelessness as he comes close but not close enough. However, Bardem steals the film as the memorable villain whose methods are odd. The ending can be seen as either symbolic or just a cop out solution in terms of Bardem's placement. It presents a strong view regarding violence and its everlasting presence and the corrupt nature of society. Title represents its strain on weary souls seeking refuge. Score: 8 / 10",

The USA have reached a point when history is the only master of the game, master of ceremonies. The USA have produced a situation that will resolve itself by using its own contradictions till the whole world is destroyed if necessary. This world is dominated by money that has to be easy and does not have to be clean, even would I say that is to be dirty: that gives it more taste and flavor. The world is dominated by the hunger of overstuffed men for anything that will satiate this hunger with something unreal, surreal, over-real: let it be a powder, an injection or whatever but let it erase the darkness of the night, even in the middle of the day, and cultivate some kind of visionary illusion. Then add the third dimension of this world seen through the distorting glass of the USA: violence not for the sake of making anyone suffer. That is no longer funny. Torturing is the pleasure of the simple minded. We are dealing here with a totally psychotic and asocial schizophrenic who can only find his satisfaction, his fun, his pleasure in imposing death in the cleanest way possible. And if a bullet does not suffice let's have a second to prevent any useless suffering. The USA in their immense hunger for money and drugs, speculation and hunger, accumulation and greed, have attracted on to themselves the worst killers ever, the worst predators ever, the worst rotten-meat-eaters you can imagine. They prosper on manure that they distillate in their speculative bank practices. They thrive on human garbage they concentrate in their appropriative confiscation of all they see and cannot accept not to have. Some try to play cat and mouse with them but these are not the cat and the cat knows it and the cat cannot accept any escape. The sheriff though will survive because he will realize the vulture is wounded less than two yards from him and he the lawman will walk away without confronting him. He will resign due to his cowardice and he will dream his father in a typical posture of the Trail of Tears celebrating the end of the Indian genocide, but carrying a horn full of fire as if Satan did not have any matches. No hope for the average American who wishes to have eternal life in this world without death and perfect innocence in a time when even new-born babies are soiled with the grossest crimes and desires imaginable. A hairless teenager at the end will find five hundred dollars kind of not enough for a five dollar Wal Mart shirt sold to the hyena who disappears when no survivor is any longer blocking his way. Pure darkness in which black finds darker shades of black to even make the absence of any light seem to be too light still to be realistic.",

Not all that much when it comes to the story but the direction and vibe of it while just about entirely having it's own thing going. Maybe it's the cat and mouse aspect of this film. The Coen brothers trademark of adding slightly odd or even awkward characters in their film works this time around as well. And their choice of casting is fantastic. Especially Javier Bardem who puts on his performance of a lifetime and will probably be known for this role for a very long time. He is basically the show stealer in this film and despite the scary nature of his character I was anxious to see what his character would do next. Javier plays this hit-man that goes around killing people with a air gun to track down where the money went from a drug cartel and goes about his business in a very intimidating and menacing manner. While having some messed up sets of principles. In fact he sort of reminded me of the villain Two-Face from the Batman franchise, but that is mainly do to the coin scenes in this film. And because he is the most unrealistic character in this film when it comes to his killing spree while not putting hardly any effort to cover up his tracks. The Coen brothers trademark of adding a bit of dark, uncomfortable or awkward humor is still present in this film. Overall this is another great installment from the Coen brothers and film lovers should most definitely check this one out. The ending however is abrupt, in fact it doesn't seem to really have a ending and seemed to wrap it up after the climax a bit too quickly but that is only a small gripe. And I don't like it when the guy that has a conscious and tries to do the right thing ends up getting screwed over in a film but that maybe to add to the realism.",

191,13 September 2008,dazend1,1, What Were The Coen's Thinking?,"I think the Coen's need to go back to film school and learn the basic rules of film making. One of which is that you never leave the audience hanging like they did with this production. All the actors delivered a great performance, but it is hard to do any great acting job when the Directors keep killing off the characters just as they start to get interesting. I set through this movie and just when it started to really get interesting the whole thing ends without even leaving it up to the audience to decide what would happen next as their was nothing to decide on. That was what the story was supposed to accomplish and failed to do. It just goes to show that what Hollywood is really lacking these days is ""Talent"". The new generation of film makers is either to lazy to come up with an interesting story line and decide that it is easier to make a re-make of an old classic just because the screen play is already done or in this case they are trying to be funny by just leaving out an ending to the whole movie. I would hope that they would have some excuse like they were over budget and just ran out of film, but to end a movie as they did without a conclusion to the story is not only very disappointing to the theater goer, but very stupid as well. Just my opinion, but this was one movie that I did demand my money back as it seems they were just missing the last reel. Go see it though and you be the judge for yourself. Enjoy! Yours in the movies.",

193,22 March 2008,volhome,1, Critics and Previews Failed Miserably,"When the trailers for Old Country came along, I must say I was mesmerized. The introduction of a wanton killer that seemingly strode his own path in a place and time yet to be determined. Along for the ride, the critics' glowing praise of the movie and especially the glow from Oscar winning performance of Javier Bardem sold me. I had missed the movie in the theatre, but seeing it on the big screen at home would make up for it. The anticipation began high, as the storyline was laid out. Heck, Josh Brolin was doing an excellent job with his little mentioned role. Tommy Lee Jones was giving another workmanlike laid-back performance as well. An there was, of course, Javier, plodding along. Okay, stick with this, it will grow and develop. Hour number two starts, and the foundation is well laid. Javier is playing a less than remorseful toad. Everyone else is playing their roles in a deadpan manner. Lord, is this what the people in Texas are really like? Don't worry, though. The critics have assured that Javier's performance is well worth it. Then the second hour ends. And so does the movie. Wait, is that the credits? You're kidding. Right? I just watch two hours of everyone playing like they were under Karloff's make-up from Frankenstein? Folks, Boris made that character believable and sympathetic. This drivel made me hate everyone associated with the movie. We didn't get a decent bad guy. We didn't get a story with a morality play. We didn't get decent ending or hope for the future. We got a stinking pile of manure and Oscar noted efforts. Well if this is what the Academy Awards have come to, then I'll make sure I never see another Award winning movie again. They passed on Kevin Costner as Mr. Brooks for this? Of, for God's sake, Please, someone tell me where I go to get a refund for the two hours of my life spent on this. I'm there in a heartbeat.",
194,16 March 2008,ken-lynne,1, What a piece of garbage.,"How this film even got nominated for an Oscar is beyond me and the fact that is won as best picture totally blows my mind. I thought it was pretty good, with some really different ways for a hit-man to kill folks. But, the ending was so horrible it ruined the entire movie. I think the writers just flat ran out of material and decided to run credits. You are left not knowing how one major was killed; not knowing for sure if an actress was, in fact, killed and not knowing what happened to either the stash or the money. Tommy Lee Jones has always been one of my favorite actors but, in this piece of trash, I don't think he was on screen for much over 15 minutes total and his part basically had nothing at all to do with the so-called story. All I can say is - YUCK!!!!",

It's an extremely original perspective of life, violence, loneliness, regrets, never boring, though a bit disturbing due to the terrifying violence. The underlying message of No Country for Old Men is also the unpredictability of real life, the set of opportunities we are missing and we have missed. Think the power of the movie is enhanced by the appropriate locations where it was shot, an outline of rural and backward America, along with violent and dangerous Mexico. I'd have expected a different finale, clearer at least, whereas this one might leave the onlooker with some doubts. Nevertheless it's surely an extraordinary story.",

So the movie was good until towards the last 30 or so minutes where it was anticlimactic because they didn't show the big final action scene like the vast majority of other movies do. I understand they was trying to be different from the other movies, but the ending just didn't give me a satisfying and intrigued feeling which movie endings should do.

200,17 February 2010,Ziya90,10, I don't exchange it for 1000 Fargo,"There a lot of people who hate the movie, not just disliked, they hate! Look at reviews or visit the forums, you will see. Art house movies are unconventional generally, but for No Country for Old Men is not an art house film, but it is not a blockbuster too. It is both, I mean artistic and at the same time entertaining. I know that the people who hate it would not call it entertainment, because they were not entertained. Then, why haters hate this movie? Because it is not a crowd pleaser? Well, firstly, they say that the movie was very dull, very very slow paced. If you ask me, the time flies by, I did not get bored at all. I was hypnotized, mesmerized. By the way, do you know what is one of the most frustrating things about this movie for me? Some people say this is inferior in comparison with Fargo or Blood Simple. I watched both movies and I am really sorry, but I enjoyed both movies, both are must- see experiences, but they are, Fargo, Blood Simple were just good movies to me, no more than that. A critics says that cinema feeling in There will be Blood was more strong than No Country for Old Men. How funny, I liked There will be Blood very much, but think just the opposite. The cinema of Old Men is more powerful than There will be Blood. Old Men is pure cinema. Another critic says that I would not call the movie masterpiece, because ultimately, a man pursues another man, this is the story. Well, this was what I wanted anyway, but also this is just the surface. The directors don't use background music (unconventional), I loved that, but this is the second complaint as I see. It makes the movie dull according to the haters. It causes me hypnotized. Many people like noisy, fast movies, this is the fact, isn't it? but why? Was Casablanca noisy or fast? No. Then, is it a movie to be hated? As for Javier Bardem, his performance, acting is appreciated even by the haters, otherwise I would kill myself anyway. Joking aside, you will think that I exaggerate, but no, to me, his performance, acting is one of the best ones of all time and his character is one of the best villains so far too. What Day Lewis is in There will be Blood, Bardem is in No Country for Old Men. A superhuman performance. Just by one scene, it can be understood. In one of the most disturbing scenes, even if off screen, I mean his last visit, after that, in the car, look at his face! It tells a lot of things. The opening scene of the movie is one of the greatest opening scenes ever made! In terms of content, it is horrible, in terms of cinema, it is great. In this scene, Bardem is at one of the zeniths of his performance by the way. To watch this character, Anton Chigurh was very entertaining, very interesting, sometimes funny and sometimes evil, horrible. One of the reasons that I love the movie is this, I mean, The Brothers created a great character, to be more precise, they adapted the character in a perfectionist way from the novel. As for Chigurh's weapons, forbidding, horrible, weird, but also inventive. I knew Josh Brolin by this movie, I can't remember him in The Goonies, I watched it when I was a child but. Therefore, I liked the actor very much including his character. After that I watched him in American Gangster and he was great in that movie. In this movie, he is in Bardem's shadow, but still does a great job. He was an interesting character too. On average, how many favorite scenes you have in a movie? No Country for Old Men is an exception for me, because if I count my favorite scenes, it makes almost the whole movie. All the scenes Bardem appears are my favorites once. I will mention some of them. The scene that he tries to find the bag by the device, the scene that he carries out first aid to himself (this scene also tells somethings about the personality of the character, he is really a psychopath, he seems panicked, he cares about himself, his health very much), the scene that he makes a sudden attack to the hotel, again a horrible, but in terms of direction, a fresh, great scene. I had not been on pins and needles like that in another movie. There are several reasons for that. For example, Anton Chigurh is like T-1000 from The Terminator 2. In some moments, I said to myself that's it! or something like that in theater. Now do you understand why I love that? As for the sheriff (our bonus Tommy Lee Jones), the first sheriff character on screen who is unwilling to solve the cases, catch the bad guys (unconventional and brilliant) And, as the third complaint, a few unexpected twists that take place near the final. It might be unsatisfying, but it was realistic and shocking. Everything does not work out the way we expect it will.",

I'm 43, and I have seen some of the greatest films ever made - foreign and domestic. I have also seen everything in between. Some reviewer said this was a 'brilliant examination of fate'. Huh? Really, how much depth is there in a coin toss to determine if the killer slays his victim or not?! The saddest part of the film is Tommy Lee Jones' character. He hovers around basically doing nothing, and just mildly investigates the crimes. He never encounters the 'good guy' or the bad guy until the good guy's dead. He misses the bad guy, BTW.

But when you get to this final scene in the movie version, the viewer has no such advance warning, so as the lead character reaches the end of his speech about a dream he's had, and the screen goes dark, the movie's end seems abrupt and un-satisfying. The Coens could have easily solved this problem by visualizing the dream, showing it with the speaker's voice on the soundtrack. Would have made for a much more cinematic finish.

Even so, there are also some ""ordinary"" people whom were also being killed and that's mainly because some of these civilians ""choosed a path"" what's the point in getting involved in a life of crime and with these criminal activities and what's the risk. On the other hand, I would still think this film to be a masterpiece from the Coen Brothers and its well made and I would recommend it only to those whom would have a better understanding on what's it all about.",

With the face of Tommy Lee Jones in his always wise and powerful presence, comes the wisdom of a warrior who seeks justice in a world filled with malice and destruction. Brolin's face gives a similar feeling, with some wisdom, but stubborn determination. Bardem's face is haunting and yet intriguing, as it gives off the feeling of incomprehensible force beyond human conception, and that is exactly what his character Anton Chigurh stands as. In their first attempt, and it is a successful one indeed, the Coen's have delivered a faithful and brutal depiction of Cormac McCarthy's book of the same name, as they return to the darker psychological roots that first spawned their Neo Noir debut, Blood Simple. No Country for Old Men although dawned with the usual Coen Brother's humor, has very little hope to go on as it borders around a world that McCarthy knows all too well, apathetic, deteriorating ,and absent of God.",

What time comes to show them, however, is that life always holds all the aces, and that not one of them will emerge from their struggle with an ending that suits them in the long term. Even Chigurh, the one whom all his fellow humans fear throughout the runtime - seeming to carry as he does an aura of supernatural invulnerability - gets an implacable air of natural justice served upon him by receiving the scars of hard-fought struggle. It's an extremely fatalistic message delivered to us, emphasised by the barren and unforgiving landscape that is the arena for these happenings.

240,27 November 2014,Movie-ManDan,10," A Little Overrated, But Still Awesome.","I just want to say that Fargo is Joel and Ethan's best. No Country For Old Men does not even come close to it. All that say this is 2007's best, I might agree with. I actually thought that there wasn't many great flicks that came out that year. This would not have been so well-received if it came out ten years earlier. However, I did like this lots. The Coen brothers never let me down. Like the other movies they've done, No Country For Old Men features cool characters, intriguing dialogue, and loads of suspense. This follows a redneck (Brolin) who finds a suitcase of money from a drug deal gone wrong. He is followed by a nutcase (Bardem) that escapes from prison and is after the money. A sheriff (Jones) may be the only one that can bring peace to the bloodshed that soon happens. As I said earlier, all characters are awesome. Bardem is probably the best one as he plays a stone-cold killer that is as evil as can be. Brolin is the character that everybody roots for and Jones plays a great sheriff with a troubled past. The first little bit contains very little dialogue. Little dialogue during a cat-and-mouse game adds lots of suspense. You are interested with what diabolical move Bardem is going to do and how Brolin will keep the money. How can characters be developed well with little dialogue? Watch and see. Eventually, more dialogue does come in, along with more of Jones, while still trying to stay the same noir-western style as earlier. Nothing is wrong with that, it just needs to be as clever as before, if not more. The movie is still exciting and fun, but it eventually just gets stale as the plot slows down, so the suspense decreases. The movie changes from a thriller to a drama. If a movie is a thriller, keep it a thriller, but add drama to it. Or is a movie is a drama, make it an exciting one. I didn't mind the Coen brother changing the genre the way they did, I just thought the movie lost something when it happened.",

It's ridiculously faithful to the source material and it's visualized in such a gorgeously cinematic way that it's no wonder this movie won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2008 (for the films of 2007). It's a neo-Western, neo-noir thriller that is virtually an extravagant showcase for Javier Bardem's terrifying villain Anton Chigurh (which won Bardem the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor).

A part of me still wants to like her (this movie) because it showed such great potential. Both the main character, the Nam vet Moss, and the villain were impressive in their resourcefulness without being typical, over-the-top, Hollywood-style heroes and anti-heroes. I wasn't too impressed with either Woody Harrelson's or Tommy Lee Jone's characters, but they were secondary to the main contest. I was looking forward to the actual showdown though. Instead, Moss is killed by banditos, a scene which we are deprived of for some reason. The villain later kills Moss's wife and then, after an unrelated car crash, stumbles away and we never find out his ultimate fate. After the death of Moss and his wife (I still wasn't even sure at that point if Moss was really even dead), I thought, 'Ok, now it'll come down to a showdown between Tommy Lee Jones and the villain. Surely, he won't let him get away with killing the sweet, innocent wife."" Guess again! Instead, what we are treated to is this drawn out exploration of Tommy Lee Jone's internal and external relationships as he decides to call it quits! WTF is up with Hollywood?! Last weekend, I made the mistake of watching King's crapfest, defeatist ""Horror"" flick, The Mist, where all the main heroes have a suicide pact at the end rather than take their chances and fight to survive against the monster bugs. This weekend, I was treated to another defeatist ending where the aging sheriff calls it quits and decides to enjoy his pension rather than put his life on the line to kill this psychopath.

This is just more of the same old snuff porn that has been making the rounds of Hollywood since at least ""The Godfather"", except now it's being directed by the usually incomprehensible and slow-as-molasses Coen Brothers, who seem to have decided to exchange art for profit, this time around, by following the psychopathic-killer-on-a-rampage gravy train all the way to the bank and giving the dumbed-down US public what they really crave: a virtual murder spree à la Grand Theft Auto with lots of comic book horror.

And crime doesn't come any more out-of-hand, any darker or more horrifying than Anton Chigurh, masterfully played by Javier Bardem, an evil assassin which seems alienated from the rest of the world, looking at the other human beings as targets, intruders or no nothing. And crime floats over in the desert, as drug-dealing Mexicans executes deals-gone-bad, and this is where Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) comes in; as he discovers the $2 million in cash, he decides to take the money and run - who wouldn't? Drug-money belongs to nobody, and Moss becomes the film's moral dilemma, and Brolin gives the character the human heart the part needs; as we can put ourselves in his boots in this hellacious setting of crime and disgust. The great Roger Deakins, the director of photography, along with the Coen-brothers creates poetry here; not just one of 2007's most brilliant movies - but this is up there with Coen-classics as Fargo and the Big Lebowski.

However i've always been a bit of a Coen brothers fan and i'd read the great reviews this movie has garnered and i was determined to overcome my general squeamishness in the face of unrelenting violence so i went to see it on my own. As it turned out the cinema was full of people most of whom i guess had read the same reviews as me. Or perhaps they'd decided to escape the unrelenting Adelaide heat by spending a few hours in the tranquility of an air-conditioned cinema. I have to say at the end that I think there was a general air of disappointment from everyone in the movie theatre. I'm still trying to figure out exactly what Tommy Lee Jones role IS in this movie. He could have been left out altogether and it would make no difference at all to the film. The ending where he describes his dream sequence is a terrible letdown. How many people enjoy listening to someone describe their dreams?Its about as interesting cinematically as it is in real life. When he finished I think everyone was hoping that this wasn't going to be the end of the movie...and then the credits began to roll. The movie does contain some wonderful quirky dialogue and some great acting from Javier Bardem. There are suspenseful moments while Josh Brolin in on the run and this is no formula driven plot where you can tell what is going to happen from one moment to the next.

Bardem stands out, naturally; a largely silent presence who (though a very different type of character) builds up Lecter-like levels of evil dread as he goes about his terrible business. As much as it's an exquisitely tense crime story, it's also a mediation on what it's like to feel as if the world is leaving you behind; it's not what you once knew, and what's gone can't ever be recaptured now this new evil as blown into town, exposing much else in its wake.

278,6 June 2014,barryrd,9, Dark Masterpiece,"Joel and Ethan Coen have made something of a dark masterpiece in this movie, shot in the American southwest with desert landscapes and one-on-one encounters that are grim, chilling and sometimes strangely amusing. The time is 1978 and two of the characters are Vietnam veterans. The acting is outstanding, particularly Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. Woody Harrelson is a droll and cynical investigator in a supporting role. The directors use pauses, muted soundtracks, silent gunshots and chase scenes, often shot in darkness inside and out. Tommy Lee Jones, the sheriff, is the most stable character and the man most aware of his own faults and the evils he sees in the world. Times are changing with crime more widespread and he takes solace in the past. Kelly MacDonald is outstanding as the wife of Josh Brolin. A downbeat but utterly fascinating movie, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.",

The opening twenty minutes or so, in which Brolin, who is out hunting antelopes (?) and discovers the crime scene, are simply mesmerizing. Bardem's relentless chase to find and kill Brolin and recover the money is what the film primarily focuses on, and it brings out both his and Brolin's characters, which are both fantastically well- acted. The chase straddles the Texas-Mexico border, somewhat reminiscent of Walter Hill's awesomely good ""Extreme Prejudice"". There is a philosophical angle, from the novel by Cormac McCarthy, that the film is based on, that makes this notably more than mindless action, but that creates an ambiguous conclusion that challenges the viewer's expectations.",
286,11 February 2017,Marwan-Bob,9, Anton Chigurh is one of the greatest evils in cinema - ever,"The film is set in rural West Texas, with the main character a welder and hunter named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers the remains of several drug runners who have managed to kill each other in an exchange gone violently wrong. Rather than report the discovery to the sheriff Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), He decides to simply to pocket the 2 million dollars for himself. The result of that decision puts a psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), on his trail by the drug cartel. This killer is a dispassionate murderer of nearly every rival, bystander and even his employer in his pursuit of Moss. As Moss desperately attempts to keep one step ahead, the blood from this hunt begins to flow behind him with relentlessly growing intensity as Chigurh closes in. Meanwhile, the laconic Sheriff Ed Tom Bell blithely oversees the investigation even as he struggles to face the sheer enormity of the crimes he is attempting to thwart. This is a Coen brothers' team of direction and production that is beautifully terse and very intense. The film provides ""edge of your seat"" and these quickly paced action scenes are tightly constructed and presented like a Hitchcock film with its almost morbid silence in the showing of the act of murder. Any lesser movie would seemingly dissolve into cat and mouse territory, by the middle of the film, but here there are more shoot outs and standoffs galore and the viewer begs to anticipate what is happening next, but cannot. Nothing is ever quite what it seems in this bleak but mesmerizing country, as Tommy Lee Jones shows up as a soon to be retired sheriff, and commands the screen by pumping the drama with morality and reality versus the mayhem preceding him. It is a very unique film that begs watching again and again.",

291,18 April 2009,Isaac5855,8, The Cohen Brothers Strike Gold with another Winner...,"Joel and Ethan Cohen brought home the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2007 with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, a dark and chilling suspense thriller which takes the classic cat and mouse chase genre to an entirely new level. The film stars Josh Brolin, in his finest performance to date, as a schnook who happens upon the remains of a brutal crime scene, where he finds several dead bodies, a huge shipment of heroine, and a case containing two million dollars and the consequences of his fatalistic decision to take off with the money, prompting his being hunted by a cold-blooded assassin (Jarvier Bardem), who will stop at nothing to get his money back. Throw in a laid back Texan sheriff (played to perfection by Tommy Lee Jones)assigned to the case and you have all the ingredients of a first class thriller. This gritty and uncompromising drama pulls no punches and offers no easy solutions to a myriad of questions it raises, most notably, ""Did this guy really think he could get away with stealing two million dollars?"" The film is dark and atmospheric, creating such a height of suspense that there is virtually no music score and you really don't miss it. The suspense created by the story propels the film itself. Jarvier Bardem won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his bone-chilling performance as Chagur, the deadly and apparently conscience-free killer chasing Brolin. Bardem creates one of the most terrifying cinematic villains ever, whose brutality is only surpassed by his unpredictability. The Cohens have crafted an intricate story that does peter out toward the end, but for the majority of its running time, will have you literally holding your breath. Not quite up the standards of their classic FARGO, the film is still practically a classic that improves upon repeat viewings and reinforces Joel and Ethan Cohen as filmmakers to be reckoned with.",

295,4 January 2008,Monotreme02,10," A masterpiece if I've ever seen one; the Coens are back in form, their best film yet","The film represents a downright uncanny application of cinematic craft on the Coen's part. They deliver storytelling in its most flawless, raw, visceral form, and indeed the film has quite the incredible story to tell, based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy (which I have intentionally put off reading in order to enjoy the film to the fullest, although I fully intend to seek it out now  by the way, if anybody hasn't read McCarthy's Pulitzer-Prize winning novel ""The Road"", do so now). But the Coens have long before transcended telling a mere plot. The film provides its best storytelling when there is no dialogue. Notice with what utter grace and absolute perfection the Coens create tension and drama. From the first moment he appears on screen, we are scared petrified of the Anton Chigurh character, and the Coens have calculated the introduction of his appearance and mannerisms so that every time he merely walks onto the screen, we get chills down our spine. Behold probably the most amazingly directed sequence of any film this year, which involves Llewelyn Moss sitting in his motel room and hearing what are clearly Chigurh's footsteps coming down the hall, until his shadow appears under the crack of the door. But if only that were all  Chigurh continues to turn off the light, drenching the scene in pitch-darkness. No other scene in any other film this year has more effortlessly created tension and true, primal fear within me as a viewer. And the scene continues, as Llewelyn apprehends a vehicle, immediately after which the windshield begins to shatter from Chigurh's shots that are being fired from who knows where, which further elevates the pressure. One of the scariest scenes in any film this year cannot be found in The Mist, or in 1408, or in any of the shock-horror pictures put out, but rather can be found right near the beginning of No Country, as the Chigurh character enters a small gas station shop and manages, without doing much at all besides playing an almost-too-calm word game with the teller, to obstinately petrify and terrorize us. I don't think a screen character has ever been depicted as more nervous than that of the store clerk in the scene in question. It is precisely these characters, such as that of the store clerk or the overweight landlady at the trailer park, that make this film so unmistakably Coen. Their mannerisms and way of talking, while not meant to be comic, are presented in an almost comic fashion. It is that unique Coen sense of humour, in which they turn the nerve-racking edginess and anxiety in the gas station scene with Chigurh into a comic moment. The Coens have an uncanny ability to create comedy simply out of the absurdity of the situation. Not a word is wasted, and every strand of dialogue, every line and passage, is absolutely and entirely pitch-perfect; it is an incredible, extraordinary screenplay.",
296,13 June 2014,RossRivero99,10, Coen brothers at their best,"Joel and Ethan Coen's No Country for Old Men is kind of similar to a film that was directed by Quentin Tarantino but more thrilling. The movie tells the story about a hunter named Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin) who steps in the middle of a gone wrong drug deal and more than $2,000,000 in cash near the Rio Grande. The reason why I consider this to be similar to Tarantino's movies is because of the gory violence that goes on in this movie by Javier Bardem's character Anton Chigurh. also there was a special somebody who had an important part of this movie and that is the main character Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones) the man who investigates this whole thing. Throughout this movie there were a lot of great performances from Jones, Bardem, Brolin, and especially Woody Harrelson as one of Llewelyn's friends. This was a great movie to begin with and also the best movie of 2007.",

Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is the most dangerous, demented, determined homicidal maniac since ""The Texas Chain-Saw Massacre"" (1974) and ""Jaws"" (1975), but the attempt to make him a mystical critter in Room 114 at the end, by having him appear, then disappear, contradicts Anton Chekhov's maxim which posits that if you show the gun, you have to use it. Novelists can dabble in mystification, but photographs are too specific. And these maunderings about old age are useless. Great pictures, like ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) and ""The Searchers"" (1956) are effortlessly profound; this film is satisfied to fake it.",
300,11 November 2007,zetes,10," Almost a horror movie at times, this is one fantastic thriller and one of the Coens' best","I'm not sure one viewing can do this film justice. It leaves a lot to think about, and I spent a good portion of my Sunday reading other people's views to see if I can come to some sort of conclusion about it. But I can't yet. Well, I can come to the conclusion, in any case, that this is a fantastic movie. There's no doubt about that. The Coens go back to their darker, noir-inspired sides, making the barren Texas landscape feel as cold as the Minnesota winter. The central story has a Vietnam veteran, played by Josh Brolin, finding a bundle of cash on the scene of a drug deal gone wrong. Meanwhile, a methodical killer by the name of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) hunts him down. On the sidelines is an aging sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) who works something like a Greek chorus, commenting on the main action but never able to have any effect on it. Looked at as a simple piece of film-making, No Country is brilliant. The Coens create a couple of the best setpieces they've ever done. They crank the tension up so high that I  along with the entire audience  was holding my breath. This is the closest thing the Coens have ever made to a horror movie, too. At times, it reminded me of a slasher, where we're waiting to see Chigurh dispose of his next victim in a gruesome way. But unlike your common director of a slasher movie, the Coens know how to make movies. It's not enjoyable when someone gets killed here. It feels all too realm and frankly it was scaring the hell out of me at times. Bardem plays the most memorable movie monster of the current decade. The character even sees himself as a monster, of sorts, as a hand of fate. In that way, Chigurh reminds me of another movie character, Ryunosuke Tsukue, Tatsuya Nakadai's character in Kihachi Okamoto's Sword of Doom. The two films share some similarities (surely unintentionally), for example the almost Brechtian dodge of a conventional climax that forces us to reconsider what  and who  the films are actually about. I think one big question that I've come up with is whether the film sees Chigurh as a force of nature, or whether it is just Chigurh seeing himself that way, and that he is as much subject to the forces of nature and fate as anyone else in the story. No Country started to lose me a little when it went after some big themes at the end. I feel like I didn't absorb everything there was, and maybe I just didn't ""get"" what the authors (the Coens and Cormac McCarthy, with whose work I'm entirely unfamiliar outside of this film) were going for. But I also have a sneaking suspicion that the big themes get a little lost, that the Coens don't accomplish everything they set out to do. But I am eager to see this again  and again  to see if I can work it all out.",

In fact I'd go so far as to say it's one of the best movies ever made. It works on so many levels, from the superficial angle of a modern Western oozing with tension, down to the subatomic level of the existentialism that it inflicts. It's enough to make you question everything you thought you knew about life, dispelling the myth of karma and pointing out how unfair life can be - and not in the way of ""that's not fair!"", but from the chaotic nature of fate. The universe doesn't care whether you're a good person or not. Things just happen without rhyme or reason. We all have our own choices to make, and there's no such thing as the right choice. Llewelyn goes back to give water to the dying man and it sets him down the path that led to his death by a party he wasn't even anticipating. There's nothing to fault in this movie. Even if you were let down by the anti-climatic ending, I urge you to go back and realise the anti-climax of it all was the point of the whole film. There's no grand showdown between the good guys and bad guys. Things just happen, for better or for worse. I grant No Country For Old Men access to the exclusive 10/10 club.",

Early on, Bell tells his deputy about sending one young man who had killed a girl to the electric chair. But it's obvious that he no longer believes his efforts will stem the tide of evil - he's just going through the motions. He tells the deputy that he didn't know what to make of the boy's crime, and he knows even less what to make of the massacre in the desert, ""and I don't want to be riding into something I don't understand."" In his last speech he describes the dream where he sees his father riding past him, carrying fire in a horn. He knows his father is going to make a fire for both of them. He followed his father as sheriff, but his father died in the line of duty while still a young man, while he's grown old without making much difference.

The film tells the story of Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a Texan sheriff of the 80s who finds himself looking for Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a typical hunter who comes across and steals a bag full of Scene of a crime, but his bad luck is that the complete psychotic Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) that turns the hunter into prey. The script is confusing to create a plot so sharp and attractive that completely erases us from the real sense and moral of the film, do not get me wrong, I love the hunt and think the way it is ruled magisterial, but maybe even the most Watching the end of the movie with the feeling of being betrayed, and every time the script tries to use metaphor completely from the climate of the film that it creates, apart from being disorganized and disjointed are to create a context that already There are but few realized, that is, the script is so clever and closed in himself, that he has a life of his own to a point that he chooses to tell the story attractive and drown his morale.

The big technical truffle of the film is its cameras, its angles are completely perfect, the film does not need dialogue because the camera constantly talks with the viewer, it guides us, shows us the way, how we should follow, what we should observe, the Coen brothers really make the camera a door to the movies in this movie, although they also have a good picture with a more red palette, a spectacular editing and sound mixing, because the sound in the movie is something very important, the car key beating On the ignition is audible, and this is admirable, and this magnificent sound mix stifles the fact that the soundtrack is hidden. All the performances of the film are very good, but we can not speak of Javier Bardem, who plays a psycho without expressing any feelings, his acting is freezing, unlike all the great acts of psychopaths, Javier is authentic, he is Calm, it transmits terror, fear and insecurity to the viewer, and his acting is what helps, and a lot in the rhythm of the movie. Finally, we have a great movie, which has a great script, that confuses itself, and I think the film transpocición I980 is precarious, and its end is unnecessary, it is not wrong or cruel, it tries to be metaphorical and fails , He gets lost in what he wants to talk about, and 80% of people will feel betrayed by the film when they finish, although it was understandable to me, it's unnecessary, but even with these problems we have what is for me the best contemporary western, Film with great performances, excellent technical resources, attractive, contemplative and beautiful.",

It's not Gothic because it is too tied to the earthen landscape, and it's barely a thriller, because, well, it's so predictable. It's simply a monster movie- a bit more realistic than the Hannibal Lecter/Freddy Krueger sort, but not much. One wonders what the film would have been like if the assassin Chigurh had been more like the hit-man character played by Forest Whitaker in Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai, Jim Jarmusch's underrated film about an assassin, which is also one of the most realistic depictions of organized crime on film. R, perhaps he could be more erratically real, like Johnny Boy, Robert De Niro's psychotic character from Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets, another realistic depiction of organized crime. Instead, what does Chigurh offer besides The Terminator and The Joker? Yes, another Batman foe, Two-Face's obsession with coin flipping to decide whether or not he commits murder. Perhaps in his construction of the novel, McCarthy thought that this device was somehow deep or profound, that it lent Chigurh the status of cosmic force of nature, but what it really did was explicitly tie the character down to a comic book level realism.

A prisoner, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), turns himself into the police then strangles a Sheriff's deputy with the chain of his handcuffs and escapes. Stealing a police car, he pulls over a driver and murders him with a device used for slaughtering cattle. In the author's words, ""He placed his hand on the man's head like a faith healer, the pneumatic hiss and click of the plunger sounded like a door closing."" That is only the beginning of the myriad violent deaths in this dark and brutal saga that is without any sympathetic characters, just the hunter and the hunted, each, however, with a kind of integrity that hints at redemption beyond the apocalypse.",

A typical example of the present-day trend to focus on gratuitous violence dished out with a tasteless watery semi-philosophical sauce which aims at conveying a vague ethical message. Others have pointed out that I didn't get the humor of it all. Well, apart from all the excessive visual violence, I particularly remember one scene where the psycho leaves the house of yet another victim whom he has obviously just slaughtered and casually looks down at the sole of his shoe to see if there are no bloodstains on it. Humor? Funny? I think not. Sam Peckinpah would have made this movie in his usual detached way. The fact that the Cohen brothers favor the same kind of meaningless violence but nevertheless try to add a vague form of moral concern is not only revolting but also extremely hypocritical.",

Scenes of an injured dog on the plains are heart breaking. There are some gruesome scenes unbearable to watch but that rarely worries me. I do think it becomes over done though. Shock and shlock!

Either the film is badly edited and we end usp with a disconnected mess or the directors are trying to be too clever for their boots. Obviously audiences liked it but for this movie goer it was very unsatisfying and hardly worthy of an Oscar.

The way people talk, both the accents and what they say, makes it feel like you're immersed in a really good novel (which the movie obviously is based on), while at the same time it feels real.

But neither the novelist (Cormac McCarthy) nor the Coen brothers are promising any sort of deliverance through art or any other imagined alternative to mortal existence. This isn't a story for elitist intellectuals and interpreters of Yeats' frequently arcane visions. On the other hand, it's not a story for those those film-goers who insist on a traditional ""movie bad guy"" and simply cannot, or refuse to, see the universal and very personal meanings represented by the characters, all of whom--from Barden's unstoppable killer to Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff--mirror our deepest desires, fears, and insecurities. Although not a movie serving up the escape and closure expected by traditional theater audiences, it nevertheless has the power to grip and engage the viewer like few other films. And like a Flannery O'Connor short story, its dark humor and violence ultimately lodge in personal consciousness (I frankly was hanging on to my seat with white knuckles to the very end, before leaving the theater ""sadder but wiser"" for the experience).",

The 1960's science fiction film based on the book of the same name where the main plot of the story is to voluntarily commit suicide by the age of 21. This might seem more plausible in one's own personal world of dreams. Herein lies the main fault with the latest Coen Brothers big screen extravaganza: No Country for Old Men. The tract of the film seems more like a personal dream by the Coen's and not a film script. Many groups of flickering images are presented before the eyes of the audience but there is little final transion to an outcome. Llewelyn Moss (JossBrolin) is one of the films heroes, pursed by a very psychotic killer called Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Llewelyn has stumbled into a very large drug deal, gone bad at the tale end. He grabs the money, like so many other Coen Brother plots and the chase begins. Unforturatly the pursuit is more like a Tom & Jerry cartoon. We meet many other characters who get in the way of the scramble, and just like in those Saturday morning cartoons, they die. Did I forget to mention the over narration by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones)? Mr. Jones does very well, as he does in most of his efforts, because he has practiced his trade down to a fine art. Sheriff Ed is almost a re-creation of the role Mr. Jones played in Men in Black, and just as sarcastic. The Coen's undertaking is quite funny all the way to it's final flicker.

And finally, here we have yet another serial killer / slasher / scary monster genre movie in which violent and explosive scenes of murder and mayhem occur in populated environments (a motel, a hotel, an office building in broad daylight, etc.) but no one except the central players are seen, no one calls the cops, no one intervenes, no one is around at the crucial moment  too easy and way too common as filmmakers seem to feel a need to maintain a high body count to keep the audience interested. The overall effect is cartoonish. After a while I was squirming in my seat from boredom, less and less concerned with the fates of the main characters. ",

The only thing I can say is the movie tells the ""story"" as it was written in the book. I think for many the fact that there's unresolved conflict is what causes them to feel there's no story. I saw the movie in the theater and was so moved by it I had to read the book which is even better than the movie. The movie and the book are very unconventional. Carmac McCarthy has a style of writing that's elusive and heavy with symbolism and that's told in a manner that makes it feel common place and real. His setting is Texas and his characters are everyday people from the region. ",

388,17 December 2007,Galina_movie_fan,9," ""Just how dangerous is he?"" - ""Compared to what? The bubonic plague?""(from the dialog about Anton Chigurh)","""No Country for Old Men"" is a typical in the good sense Brothers Coens' film. In their new Crime /Drama / Western/Thriller, adapted from Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same title, Coens explore the subject they seem to be very interested in: the crime gone wrong, the temptations it promises, and how it involves and affects the basically good and decent people who suddenly find themselves running for their very lives with death just one step behind or even closer. It is bloody, gripping, extremely atmospheric, darker then dark, with the tension that makes your anticipation of the horrible things to happen even stronger than actually watching these things happen, and with typical for Coens humor that they find in the darkest places. If anything, the movie introduces the evil of such quiet, demented, determined, and meticulously deadly force in the character of Anton Chigurh in the performance of life time by Javier Bardem that it will set the new standards of the screen villain from now on. Bardem plays ruthless, slow speaking, coin tossing hit man who would always finish his job, keep his word, and follow his own twisted code of ethics. His favorite killing weapon is a pneumatic air gun and I am not sure when I was scared more, when Bardem used his weapon or when he politely talked and smiled with that blood freezing smile of his. I will be very surprised if Bardem does not receive the Oscar for his performance.",
389,10 May 2019,PCT1970,9, Ambiguity And The Dreams,"While reviewing a movie on IMDb I couldn't remember if I had reviewed this film. I clicked on audience reviews and was shocked by the number of reviews panning the film almost entirely because of the ambiguity of the ending. Which is fine. Everyone is entitled to an opinion. I never suggest whether to view a movie or not. This applies even when I believe a bravura film has been made. I leave it up to the reader whether they choose to view it or not. Of the four movies adapted from McCarthy's novels, which this viewer has read every one of, this film follows the novel almost to a tee. This film won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay. I'll admit I was ambivalent about the ending, but this is a virtuous film. The Coens have ended films cryptically before. In ""Raising Arizona"" H.I. is laying in bed awake and part of his monologue is, "" This whole dream, was it wishful thinking? Was I just fleeing reality like I know I'm liable to do. But me and Ed, we can be good too. And it seemed real"". It leaves the ending open for interpretation. I'll review the plot direct, I won't provide analysis, I won't address all of the symbolism and I won't examine it as thoroughly as I normally would. The ending is what I'd like to offer an opinion on. This film has astounding direction, cinematography, screenplay, settings, score and acting. The storyline follows Llewelyn finding a case full of cash from a drug deal gone awry and stealing it. This ignites a pursuit of Llewelyn being hunted by the cartel, a psychopathic bounty hunter named Chigurh who embodies evil, another bounty hunter named Carson and Sheriff Bell. During the entire film Llewelyn is able prove to be a worthy adversary for his main pursuer Chigurh. We find out Llewelyn served two tours in Vietnam which might be indicative of his survival skills. We learn from Carson that Chigurh always gets his man and that Chigurh has principles that transcend money or drugs or anything else. Bell is in pursuit to save Llewelyn from death. With Chigurh, a person's life hangs in the balance by the toss of a coin. The toss of the coin has modeled Chigurh as a force of random death. The pursuit is full of action, duplicity and killings. In the end it is only Chigurh and Bell left. To address the ending I do have to spoil one part of the film which I never do in a review. So be warned. Llewelyn is found dead in a motel room and the cash is gone. All we see is a group of men speeding out of the parking lot. We don't know who killed Llewelyn, but we do know it wasn't Chigurh. Llewelyn wasn't a classic western hero. He stole the cash. The point is that the odds caught up with him. In old westerns the hero always strolls off into the sunset. The Coens are known for a pessimistic world view. Chigurh visits Llewelyn's wife Carla Jean to fulfill his promise to kill her. After a brief exchange he explains the best he can do is offer a toss of the coin. We see him leave. Does it matter if Carla Jean is killed? Whether Chigurh has free will or not, the coin was tossed. Chigurh is sideswiped and severely injured in the crash but walks away. This is symbolic of his very own coin toss. The coin represents forces beyond our control. My interpretation of the dreams. Bell is having breakfast with his wife Loretta explaining dreams he had the previous night. In the first dream Bell's father gives him money, but he can't remember what he did with it. This symbolizes youth living in the moment and not thinking about the future. In the second dream his father is carrying a flame in a horn like people used to do. The flame symbolizes the values and integrity of the old west and old sheriffs. Bell then says, ""And then I woke up"". Cut to black. This symbolizes the world he believed in probably never existed, it was an illusion and he just realizes it. He understands that today's world is no country for old men. No matter what one's interpretation of the ending and the dreams this film is sublime, ingenious and an avant-garde modern day western. It's yet to be surpassed.",

One reason this works for me as a Coen brothers movie is its relatively simple story a cat and mouse chase between a merciless assassin and a former Vietnam War Veteran with over 2 Million Dollars in stolen drug money. This creates for a constant sense of tension and bleakness that keeps me riveted every time I watch this movie and a lot of this can be attributed to Javier Bardems incredible, Oscar Winning Performance as the film antagonist Anton Chigurh. He just perfectly captures his characters mysterious and terrifying qualities that just get the audience begging for him to get back on screen and this truly is one of the greatest performances ever given in a movie. Thought Bardem steals this movie that does not take away from both Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. I Legitimately could not imagine anyone else playing Llewelyn Moss, Brolin is perfect in this movie he just gets the characters he's playing, portraying him as a morally schizophrenic character who you can never lock down as a person. The action scenes are few in this film but that works here as it makes them more satisfying named more real adding to the constant sense of tension. I can't quite explain why but I love the fact that this movie has no score it just works for this and couldn't imagine them doing it any other way. The cinematography of course is stunning but you can expect nothing less from Roger Deakins. The Coen Brothers best film truly did win at the Oscars it's truly one of the best pictures to win best picture and it's and incredible ride that makes me wish that The Coen Brothers would reach this quality more often. 100%-A+",

Anton's influence extends beyond the novel version. A round of applause for Javier Bardem, I think there's no better acting and shaping than his presence in the cinema. The cinematography and set design of this movie are also very high quality. I especially like the sound effects and the action scenes combined with thriller, although they are shown in a flash, the effect is at max level.

This movie was great,and it treats the audience intelligently, which is something that is rare to experience in most modern movies.

Everyone in the movie theater was unwilling to leave. Everyone could not believe the movie had ended. What was the point of all the violence? Maybe this was exactly the main theme of the movie: violence without a reason, but one cannot help be violent. 'You don't need to do it.' Well, I have to say if this was really the deep message to be conveyed, I was totally not moved. Certainly people had to make tough decisions. The hunter chose whether to water the dying men, the killer attempted to give chances to his targets by coin flips. But I just could not feel any real struggles of them. They just made decisions pretty arbitrarily without too much thought. In real world everyone has to make equally serious decisions everyday! Were they special in any sense? The impossible carelessness of the hunter was annoying. Bringing the money using the original suitcase without a check. Sitting upright in front of the door to wait for the enemy's attack. Bold?

Unfortunately, they also operate (smugly) on one-note throughout, so that even when the movie hits its intended targets, there's no excitement, no awe in what we're seeing. The characters in the film do not matter to the Coens; the circumstances of the people in question are what count (and if they don't live very long, no problem; their histories and predicaments are then shucked off, forgotten about).

406,19 August 2011,MrOllie,4, Not a total disaster !!,"This film had some interesting and exciting moments - but should never have been an Oscar winner. There are simply too many silly happenings or in a lot of cases no happenings at all. Overall, there are three main characters in this film i.e., Chigurh(the killer played by Javier Bardem))Moss (the red-neck who steals the money- played by Josh Brolin) and Ed Tom Bell (The Sheriff - played by Tommy Lee Jones). It starts with the psycho killer (Chigurh) being arrested and handcuffed by a young policeman. The policeman takes him to the police station, sits him down on a chair, and then foolishly turns his back on him and makes a telephone call. The killer with amazing dexterity and all the skills of an expert Escapologist manages to contort his body so that his hands and handcuffs are not behind his back anymore but in front of his stomach. The policeman is then garroted with great aplomb by Chiqurh. The killer (who is trying to locate a bag with $2 million dollars in it stolen by Moss the red-neck) then goes on to kill many other people and to blow out door locks with either a cattle stun gun which is powered by a large oxygen cylinder, or a rifle with the biggest silencer you will ever see. Surely, therefore, someone will soon spot this madman and his oxygen cylinder and inform the army of police, who you assume by now must be hunting him. But No - because incredibly the only person looking for him is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell who spends most of his time delivering long rambling monologues or reading newspapers. So of course the Sheriff never finds Chiqurh and because he is getting old and despairing of the modern world, retires. In the meantime, the other main character Moss (played by Josh Brolin)had stumbled upon an ill-fated drug deal and finds many dead bodies. One of the gang is still only just alive and asks for water but Moss cannot help him. Moss eventually finds a case with 2 million dollars inside it. Hence the reason Chiqurh is looking for him. He takes said case and goes back to his wife, they eventually go to bed but for some strange reason he gets up in the middle of the night and returns to the scene of the drug massacre carrying a bottle of water,presumably for the injured drug dealer who by now must be dead anyway. A rather daft thing to do. The film rambles on with a brief appearance from Woody Harrelson who wears a large hat but does nothing else. This film has it's moments and is not a complete disaster but, overall, it is confusing and rather silly with a truly appalling ending.",

All of a sudden you are just watching and then the next the killer just pops out of no where. Javier Bardem was the perfect actor for this film. He looked just like a killer should, red eyed and creepy. Tommy Lee Jones although he was a supporting actor. He still played a good part and gave the movie more information. The action started out at the beginning and went until the end. The whole entire movie it kept me on the edge of my seat. Josh Brolin did an amazing job playing a man who finds two million dollars. After he finds the money he is chased down by many different people also searching for the money. I am not surprised that this movie won so many academy awards. Especially for the acting. Overall this was a very very good movie. That should be seen by anyone who likes western, action, or drama movies. I promise you will like this movie, after all look at all the other reviews. One more thing about the acting it was just amazing, I can say that over and over again. Especially Javier Bardems character. They needed him to look as scary as possible and they did.

It is one of the best films of the year, it is the best Coen brothers film since 1996's Fargo, and it is a top-notch thriller that keeps you guessing and wondering what could possibly happen next. From the startling beginning to the abrupt ending, we are always left guessing. And that is the way it should be, since none of these characters really know what is going to happen next either. From a technical view, this is perfect film-making. The camera movement is amazing. The cinematography is beautiful to look at amidst all the blood and violence, and the acting is incredibly accurate. Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, Kelly MacDonald and Woddy Harrelson are all fantastic in their respected parts. However, as it has been reported, the best is Javier Bardem, whose performance as a ruthless, cold-blooded, heartless and ultimately inhuman killing machine is so real and shocking, you might think this is Bardem's job. He deserved every award he got for this role, and he will walk away with Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars on Feb. 24. Overall, this is an amazing production. We aren't quite sure how to react to this, but think about it some more and a solution may come to mind. As for the Oscars, I believe this will win at least Supporting Actor, Director(s), Adapted Screenplay, and Cinematography. As for Best Picture, that is between No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, and the Oscar voters. Let the votes come in.",

It's a potent thriller full of great shots of the landscape and the suspense techniques intelligently use brutal violence and plenty of great camera work. Bardem gives his strongest performance of his career as the killer.

432,12 November 2013,majesty327,9, This film is near perfect.,"As a large proponent of ""Show, don't tell"", I'd say that this is in one of my top-ten movies. It's a marvel in the power understatement. Just simple actions like picking up the casing after shooting a deer make characters seem that much more real and deep. The rolling valleys, and corporate roads perfectly capture both the identity and the plight of the modern South-west. The lack of music and the addition of little background noises like the commotion in the streets, and the blowing of the wind make this movie almost seem like it's real. I felt like I was really there the entire movie. Is there plot holes? Maybe. This is a film that you have to pay attention to and pick up on the subtleties. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing I'll leave up to you. For me at least, my favorite things about this movie is the atmosphere and the subtlety. The actors also put in good performances, with Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh ultimately being the character that everyone remembers and talks about. I highly recommend this movie to people who can overcome its slow pace and general lack of explicit explanation. It's a 9.5/10, an excellent movie. And no, I don't pretend to ""get"" this movie. Whether you do or don't is not a sign of your intelligence, so much as how much you think this movie is worth getting into. It's not a fast-moving-action-thriller, but it's a great suspense film with near flawless sound design and cinematography.",

I can tell that everything what you can see of today's thrillers are often some stupid and really needless . They are full of stupid killing without any smartness . But in 2007 we could find one really great thriller . It has also one great fact. It won an Oscar for best moving picture . I think that structure of Oscar winners is changing in every year . This is movie which is made by Coen brothers and in start it is something attracting . I wasn't some big fan of their movies because after The Big Lebowski and A Serious Man I lost every hope for some their good movie .

443,28 February 2008,The_Void,8, Absolutely great for the first two thirds.,"The Coens definitely have made some of the best movies of the past two decades; I won't profess to be among their biggest fans, but it's hard to deny the likes of Fargo, Miller's Crossing and The Big Lebowski. After a dip in the form over the last few years, this film became hotly anticipated; often being touted as a 'return to form' for the Coen Brothers. Well, it is definitely a return to form and undoubtedly their best film so far this decade - but I do have to say that I'm somewhat surprised at all the praise this film has gotten. The film is based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy and focuses on Llewelyn Moss, a man who is lucky enough to stumble onto a drug deal gone wrong after following a wounded animal. He soon discovers a case containing $2 million left at the scene and does what any man would do; takes the case without reporting the crime. However, he is discovered by the sadistic and psychopathic Anton Chigurh who tracks him down by any means necessary; and he has no qualms about mercilessly murdering everyone who gets in, or around, his way.",

I wasn't a fan of Joel and Ethan Coen before this film and even after I'm still not a huge fan. I am, however, a huge fan of the writer of the novel No Country For Old Men and this movie is very faithful to the novel and the Coen's captured the essence of the novel almost perfectly.

Everything is crisp and heightened, the wind on the plains in the beginning, the guns being cocked and the air-rifle providing the films' most intense moments. Javier Bardem carries the film with easily the scariest villain on screen since Peter Lorre in ""M"". He simply oozes menace and one is left feeling slightly unsettled by the fact that you simply cannot help being drawn in by him. I cannot stress enough how GOOD this film is.

Half an hour into the movie I realized that it was not worth watching at all. There is no beginning, middle or end in the story. No events. No sharp turn. NOTHING. A very cold movie which made me skip half an hour of the movie to get to the point of the movie. I will tell you this now, there was no point at all. The only reason this movie runs for two hours is because of an hour wasted of scenes which held no meaning or use to the viewer. The cops seem to do nothing but drink coffee while a serial killer is on the run killing a number of people a day. When people were killed in the motel, no cops seemed to show up as if this meant nothing to them. A very unrealistic, unentertaining movie with left men shocked with its boring ending.",

This for me was a meaningless load of drivel - what was the point? Either it is just so clever that I missed it or it really is crap. Javier Bardem goes around killing people and your point is? For me acts of random violence are just that meaningless acts of random violence. David Grey shooting people - if you were one of the people shot it would be terrible but there is no story in it for me - it just happened and this is how I see this movie. Sorry Coen Brothers and as for Oscars well I know they are a complete farce after this won one.,
452,14 March 2008,marsh876,1, Self-indulgent Garbage.,"This movie is pretty much self-indulgent garbage. The story is very contrived and silly. Why would the guy who found the money go back to the scene of the crime, knowing that all hell would be breaking loose by the bad guys and cops? Yet this folly is the crux of the plot, because his return enables the bad guy to get on the chase. The bad guy, Chigurh, is a bad remake of many nut-killers of the past. Indestructible no matter what, with a stupid grin on his face all the time, and omniscient in knowing all, seeing all. A cartoon villain. A lot of Llewelyn's decisions and actions can be seen as stupid, but these were necessary to keep it going. So, in the end, who cares? They say there are 5 basic movie plots, and this one, the chase, is very common. So common, in fact, that NCFOM turns out empty and shallow. I guess the makers feel that, since this is an art film, they can just throw anything on the screen, and we're supposed to appreciate it like it was a piece of modern art hanging on a wall. That's OK, but who stares at a piece of meaningless shapes and colors for the time this movie ran? What are the Coens going to do next time? A five hour flick shot at a slaughterhouse, with lots of close ups and details?",

455,1 December 2007,cultfilmfan,8, No Country For Old Men,"No Country For Old Men is based upon the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy. The film is about a man named Llewelyn Moss who is hunting in the desert and uncovers a crime scene of a drug deal gone wrong. In his findings he also uncovers a briefcase full of money which he takes home with him. Meanwhile a ruthless killer named Anton Chigurh who wants the money that Llewelyn stumbled upon is now after him and Llewelyn has to watch his tracks and do everything to avoid this crafty man who will stop at nothing to get the money and to kill him also. This was a film that really is an effective thriller. The plot and the different twists are all very clever and unpredictable and unless someone read a spoiler filled review of this movie, or read the book then I guarantee you will also not know which direction this film is going to go in and what is going to happen to the characters. The mood and tension is also brilliantly set up by very little dialog and noise from the main characters and in the stalking scenes the shadows, lighting and the fact that there is little to no music in those scenes further sets up a powerful and thrilling mood and keeps you captivated to see what will happen next. This is also a very good looking film and because of the way it was shot it adds to the film's look that it tries to convey with shadows, darkness and isolated places and rooms that because of the way it was filmed really helps with the atmosphere and mood of the film. When there is talking in the film the dialog is often well written and even when we just see the camera following the characters around and seeing what they do next, this is also a great character study and an examination of what one would do in a certain situation type of movie. After I left the film at the theatre, I didn't feel that everyone in the audience was totally impressed by the film, or the way it was done. I personally found a lot to appreciate with this film and even though the plot sounds generic enough, there really is a lot of intelligence and thought behind it and because of the mood and layout of the film it further enhances just what a thrilling story this is. I also liked how the film was unlike a lot of Hollywood films in a way that it didn't use clichés, or try to do a predictable ending, or anything like that. I also admired the film all the more for that. Even though I liked this film a lot I could definitely seeing myself liking it more and more with repeat viewings and will probably grow to like it even more over time and I think the same could be said for others, or maybe even the few who were in the audience with me who I didn't get good vibes from. This is a film that will probably grow on you each time and each time will enhance your appreciation for it.",

It has a very interesting story about a Vietnam veteran who finds a bag with two million dollars, this situation unleashes a persecution between the veteran and a psycho killer looking for the money and a investigation of the local sheriff. The cast is simply wonderful, Josh Brolin gives a perfect acting as Llewelyn Moss, Javier Bardem's flawless performance earned him a Oscar nomination, totally worthy in my opinion. Tommy Lee Jones excellent as always and Woody Harrelson with a brief but very convincing role. Definitely this is one of the best movies of the year and with the Academy awards right around the corner, it has very big chances to become the great winner of the night.",

470,17 September 2008,theycallmemrglass,4, Criminally unsatisfying,"The thing is, I get what this film is saying. I get the message. I can read the expressions on Tommy Lee Jones increasingly craggy face. I get that he looks lost. I get that a Josh Brolin who finds a million pounds which belongs to gangsters is playing with fire as he tries to run with it which most of the film dwells on. I get that the contractor pursuing him is a psycho with twisted principles. The film has brilliantly executed moments of tension. The acting is delightfully subtle and passive except for, justifiably, Javier, who plays the psychotic pursuer with such frightening menace that whenever he appears on screen, you will shiver with dread at what he will do next. So why am I giving this 4/10? Simple. The ending was unsatisfying. I get the message of the film. Fine. I value a good ending to a story. If an ending does not satisfy me, morally, I take away a couple of marks. If an ending is too pretentious, I take away even more marks. If you are not fussed with endings, then you will enjoy the film. However, I do not understand why this is rated as Oscar worthy (regardless of what I think of the ending). Its technically accomplished but ultimately shallow save for some great moments of tension. But for a Coen Brothers film this is a major disappointment.",

475,2 May 2012,amillerz3,10," No Country For Old Men: Despite What Anyone Says, the Academy Got it Right","No Country For Old Men starts out as a traditional Western: beautiful cinematography, funny accents, cowboy hats, Mexican drug cartels, satchels of money, the works. We have our good guy, down-on-his luck sharpshooter Llewelyn Moss who finds the money, and we have our bad guy, raging maniacal psychopath Anton Chigurh who is chasing after him. Now before you go ahead and say, ""I know where this is going,"" you can stop right in your tracks because you don't. You can and never will know where this is going until you see the movie. Now to all those nay-sayers out there, calling this film petty names and making fun of it. While I respect your opinion, you must look beyond the surface of this film into its deeper meanings and implications. No movie is perfect (I personally think this one is, but that's just an opinion), but you are criticizing the length of a shot or a technique one character uses, all of the little things, while important, are no reason to give a movie a one or a two. Looking beyond the surface, one can find many hidden themes to this movie. One is about the nature of violence, an age old theme that dates back to Biblical times. Ed Tom Bell, the local sheriff, opens up the story talking about how the older sheriffs didn't even carry guns. Then, you meet Anton Chigurh, the reason behind Bell's decision to wear one. Chigurh strangles a man with his handcuffs, and kills many others with a silenced SPAS-12. His very presence is intimidating, his actions are unclear and ambiguous, and his face expresses no emotion. He is the perfect villain. Finally, you have Llewelyn Moss, who is, arguably, the main character of our story. He kills exactly like Chigurh: he shoots beings that he believes are inferior to him. However, he doesn't shoot blindly; he takes his time, lines up his shot, processes his thoughts, then shoots at an animal (he misses anyway). The only other time he tries to kill is out of self- defense when Chigurh is attacking him. Chigurh represents the unnecessary violence: killing for pleasure, for sport, and killing beings of equal stature. Moss represents this to a much lesser degree: he never tries to kill humans for sport, but he kills animals for sport. Bell is pure goodness: he doesn't kill anyone on screen. He doesn't even try to. He talks about a death he enticed once, but that was only as a preventative measure against more death. You also have the relationship between the hunter and the hunted. Everyone plays both characters in this film. Chigurh is hunting Moss, and is always hunted by the police. Moss is hunted by Chigurh, the police, and his wife, but, in return, he hunts game and once goes after Chigurh. Bell is hunted by his conscience, but is also hunting Moss and Chigurh. There are so many other intricately laid details that point to many other global messages that there are too many to delve into. If you just want to watch this movie for the sake of watching it, please note: it is very gruesome, and it features one of the best villains in the history of filmmaking. Very few people will appreciate this movie, not because of its beginning, but because of its ending. The ending is very articulately planned to have complete and utter meaning in every camera movement. Focus on the ending, be warned of gruesomeness, and watch Javier Bardem give the performance of a lifetime. Go see No Country For Old Men.",

479,21 November 2007,kgprophet,6, Is this the Sopranos? - **Spoiler Alert**,"There are 3 acts in a given movie. The setup, the complication, and the resolution. This screenplay smells as though it has been simmering over time with rewrites and re-imagining. The first two acts are classic ""Blood Simple"" mechanics of messy violence and greed. You could almost see this as the world of ""Fargo"", where killing sprees seem to be commonplace. Here, we're back in the slow south, a favourite setting for the Coens. The villain is worth the ticket price alone, a truly well cast and twisted killer that uses a novel device to eliminate any obstacles. The setting is also fun, set in 1980, you are immersed in the old Texas towns like in the original ""The Getaway"". Tommy Lee Jones, who is a main character, gets very little screen time. Josh Brolin is the archetypical everyguy. He makes (mostly) smart decisions once he discovers a stash of drug money. But it is Chigurh, the villain, that dominates the mood of the piece, and will certainly be talked about in the future. There lots of 'gotchas' that make you jump, and the well crafted sequence of events are fun to watch as they play out. So you are juiced through the 1st and 2nd acts, only to be given a different outcome.",
480,28 February 2008,richard_sleboe,10, With good reason,"Reason has come to life on the silver screen. But not as we know it. ""No Country for Old Men"" brings us reason as described by Neal Stephenson in ""Snow Crash"". Reason is a weapon. But not just any weapon. It's the ultimate weapon, wielded by a mysterious man (Bardem) the Sheriff (Jones) thinks is not a man at all, but a ghost. Retired welder Llewelyn Moss (Brolin) fails to read the signs. He pays a stiff price, for a very unreasonable act of charity, when he comes face to face with reason. It's a hopeless endeavor to point out subtle scenes or magical moments, simply because there are so many of them. At the same time, this movie is much more than a string of scenes. Suffice it to say neither human law nor divine intervention have any way of stopping the sheriff's lonesome ride into the darkness. While the movie meets the high standards of superior craftsmanship and quirky humor we have come to expect from the Coen brothers, it also achieves a new level of coherence and subtlety. It's much closer to ""Blood Simple"" and ""Fargo"" than to ""The Big Lebowski"" or ""Intolerable Cruelty"". It's also a tribute to past masters of the genre. Just as Sheriff Bell tries to prove himself worthy of the legacy of long-forgotten law enforcement officers, the directors try to hold their own in the celebrated company of John Ford, Howard Hawks, John Sturges, or Fred Zinnemann. I think it's safe to say the old-timers would welcome the brothers at their table.",

Bad men and a story line that was worse than bad.,"I am easy to please when it comes to movies but my wife and I came away from this one looking for someone in management to ask for our money back. On the pro side it started out and pretty much developed as a good story line and it had some good acting talent. Bad men. Moral issues. Tommy Lee Jones was on his way to a good film and then the script failed him and he just rolled over, so I guess he needed the money. I like Tommy Lee but this was his worst effort. The best acting in this otherwise awful movie was the baddest of the bad guys who is an actor most of us have not seen before. Javier Bardem's character will make you want to sleep with a loaded shotgun in your bed tonight. Overall the movie started out with basically good underpinnings.... and kept you interested for almost 2 hours.... and then it all fell apart in the last 5 minutes. An absolutely horrible ending. I only hope that Javier Bardem is out looking for the Coens so he can blast them like his other targets! The story builds suspense and characters and then it is like the Cohens ran out of production money, ideas, talent and interest... all at the same time.

487,11 September 2007,death-hilarious,9, Coen brothers a perfect match for McCarthy's No Country for Old Men,"This is the one movie that I allowed myself to go into with ridiculously high expectations. The reason was, that the source material, Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name, was so perfectly suited to cinematic translation, and more specifically, to a cinematic translation at the hands of the Coen brothers. The novel was packed with a great cast of characters, a deliciously dark sense of humor, and set against the backdrop of the vast desert vistas and small towns of the American south. With stuff like this, I thought there was no way the Coen brothers could possibly go wrong, and I was right. The plot follows Lewellen Moss (Josh Brolin) who, while out hunting, discovers a stash of $2 million dollars in a drug deal gone wrong. Without fully understanding the consequences of taking the money Moss, something of a cross between average blue-collar Joe and resourceful survivalist, is thrust into a world of very dangerous men who will stop at nothing to get the money back. The brutal hunt is played against small town Sheriff Ed Tom Bell's (Tommy Lee Jones)own attempts to find and help Moss before it is too late. Cormac McCarthy, who is the premier chronicler of the loss of the American west, is here telling the story of the loss of small town America through the eyes of the over-matched Sheriff Bell who has a hard time coming to terms with the boldness and brutality of this new generation of outlaws. Figures like Anton Chigurh, who draws his victims into discussions about causality before having them flip a coin to decide their fate.",

Next we have Woody Harrelson a great actor getting such a small insignificant part, I was hoping to see a strong confrontation when he comes up against Anton, but what do we get, a bit of chatting and then Anton kills him. Then finally a dreadful ending which i wont even bother commenting on as it was total crap. And guess what, I bet it will win The Best Fim Oscar to boot.

Was there no cell to put him in? The hunter has a pang of conscience and returns to 'drug deal gone bad' scene with some water for one of dying dealers. There was no explanation of why the deal went wrong in the first place; obviously the two parties each brought their goods. Why didn't the hunter just call the police/sheriff from a payphone and say he saw a scene of carnage in the desert instead of taking a dying man water in a jug? After the deputy was killed, why wasn't there a manhunt out for the killer? The sheriff seemed to dwell on his retirement more than stopping the carnage. Where were the Texas Rangers in all of this? If the sheriff was overwhelmed, why didn't he call for help? Did no one in Texas carry a gun other than the killer?

Now that I've seen it (not once, but twice -- more on that later) I've come to think the man upstairs might have been trying to spare me several dollars. First off, with such expectations going in, this will have to rank as one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen.

493,14 April 2008,fertilecelluloid,9," By anybody's reckoning, a supreme achievement","My problem with the much-discussed ending is not that the bad guy gets away. My problem is that the ending doesn't quite work emotionally. The film slams to a momentum-jarring stop that isn't entirely satisfying (at least on the first viewing). It makes sense, of course, and it is the same ending as in the novel, but that doesn't make an iota of difference to me because a book's one thing and a film's another. Two very different breeds. All that aside, this is still a superb, rich, beautifully written movie that is heads and shoulders above most. Javier Bardem, as the film's angel of death, is a revelation, and he commands your attention whenever he steps into frame. The plot has to do with a bag of money that ends up in hands not intended for it. Bardem's mission is to collect the money and eliminate anybody who associated with those said hands. Tommy Lee Jones is a weary cop who gradually learns that he does, indeed, live in a country where there is no place for an old man who hopes to see his retirement. On so many levels this film is exceptional. From its evocative cinematography to its rich and organic sound design, it has the stamp of quality and the whiff of aesthetic perfection. The violence is explosive and realistic, searing us like boiling hot water poured on a gaping wound. There is some supreme suspense, too, an example being the sequence in which Josh Brolin's vehicle is located and identified as he crouches in the dark desert.

But perhaps what separates this film from so many of their other great films, is how detailed and symbolic this movie is from start to finish. Every scene has a symbolic message. trust me, you will be thinking about this film for sometime after you leave the theater. Everybody saw the Bardem character in the ads, including his Prince Valiant haircut and odd weapon of choice, and were drawn to the film. Well, Bardem does not disappoint, he is incredible. Bardem's character is a principled killer with a code. Yes, he is insane, but he has rules he lives by and this is what keeps him going in an otherwise cruel and pointless world. He detests those that refuse to take life by the horns and instead settle for what is in store for them. To Bardem's character, everything is for a reason, because if it is not, what is the point. The good guys in the film are perhaps not as structured as Bardem, or are they as goal oriented. Brolin is incredible as a good ol' boy who has no idea what he has stepped into. Jones is his incredible self, playing an aging Sheriff that has hoped that God would have revealed himself to him already, but sadly, has not. He has trouble grasping the changes that he is seeing as he approaches retirement. You spend your whole life trying to create a sane and civilized society, and then you see, things are worse off than when you started. Jones has a terrific quote when he is talking to another aging Sheriff that is dumbfounded by this new generation, Jones says that ""when you stop hearing Sir and Mam and the end of sentences, trouble cannot be far behind.""

This means that it is easy to discuss the first 3 quarters of the film without spoiling the ending - but the ending seems utterly disjoint from the rest of the film, despite the fact that the narrative remains firmly in place, and the ending really is one possible set of results from the larger part of the film. So the story is certainly well structured - but nothing in the main action of the film prepares for any of the events of the end. The film is brilliantly made; but this almost experimental, uncompromising insistence on uncertainty leaves me more confused than morally challenged.",

515,18 February 2016,royalewcheese11,10, An instant classic for the history books.,"In the year 2007, two of modern cinema's most unique and creative filmmakers united once again to adapt a rich piece of storytelling into a miraculous landmark in the history of art – a film we can easily call an instant classic. It is not difficult to attach that label when something so clearly merits it, but defining with words the perfection it achieves does present a challenge. Here goes nothing. Joel & Ethan Coens' masterpiece, No Country for Old Men, more than deservedly won the Oscar for Best Picture in a year stacked with great films. It was simply a triumph that could not be ignored, regardless of its complete lack of common traits the academy tends to reward. The film not only explores a much darker genre than past recipients of the trophy, but it also never succumbs to a single mechanical cliché or convention known to said genre's endless amount of previous subjects. Among many other trademarks, the Coen brothers are notorious for throwing curve-balls at their audience at the turn of every corner, and the material supplied in this case uncannily complements their inimitably transcendent flair. We're treated to a thrilling crime plot wherein Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers a drug exchange's fatal aftermath and makes off with the satchel of money left behind, being sought after as a result by a psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Interwoven with this familiar-sounding setup is an interesting observation of the sheriff investigating the situation, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), during a late period in his life in which he ponders and recollects about the state of humanity and his place in it.",

In the most simple terms the audience is tricked into experiencing real art. It begins in a familiar manner and once we are buying in it gets deep. This is where many get lost as it is an unexpected twist. What are we doing here? Does my work and my life matter at all? What motivates me? How surreal is my waking life and how real is my dream life? Is there more going on here than I can perceive? As the audience is steered towards deeper meaning and questions, many will feel confused and uncomfortable. Real art is rare. Real art may produce a surprising array of emotional reactions. Watch is again. Only this time try to feel it more than you see it. It may make a lot more sense in a decade or two.",

519,31 January 2008,stowbury,6, Thin material padded out with over-familiar Coen gimmicks,"We've seen all this before and didn't really need to see it again. The ingredients in terms of the characters are very similar to Fargo - 1. Ruthless psychopathic killer(s), 2. Ordinary guy with bad motives getting into something over his head, 3. A good-hearted cop, outwardly unimpressive and seemingly impotent in the face of the evil thuggery let loose in the neighbourhood but clever and wise, trying to piece together what's going on and prevent tragedy. The story this time around however is thin and over-familiar - an obsessive vengeful quest, a duel between hunter and hunted that occupies most of the film. The characters too are dull in comparison to their Fargo counterparts. Despite the trademark style and quirky flourishes this is by and large a plodding, predictable exercise in ritualistic machismo. I didn't really care who got killed and when. It is not a masterpiece or even a return to form. The best moment was early on when the old almost retired sheriff and his young sidekick survey the bloody aftermath of a criminal deal gone wrong and exchange banter in theorising about what happened. Instead of developing the younger cop's part the scriptwriter casts it aside half-way through and with it goes much of the interest in the older cop too. The trail of violence runs its course and some empty banalities uttered by the world-weary lawman that pass for significant wisdom bring the proceedings to a close.",

I expected this to be the Coen Brothers masterpiece thus far, a new level for them, but it still seemed to be the same old same old. Now Javier Bardem (where did this guy come from??) plays an excellent villain, you can see it in his eyes alone. He's completely ruthless and without a conscience to the point that it's just funny. And that's vintage Coen Brothers right there- this kind of black humor. There's some great dialogue, and even some classic moments of stylized violence that give it real potential. Watch for one memorable scene involving a very explosive diversion this villain creates outside a small-town pharmacy. The film moves at a rather slow pace, and taking place in the southwest, the Coen Brothers, as they did in ""O Brother Where Art Thou,"" seem to rely too much on southern stereotypes for humor's sake rather than a true knowledge and understanding of the south. Still worth seeing.",

523,12 June 2008,jboothmillard,8, No Country for Old Men,"From Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning (and nominated) writer/director brothers Joel and Ethan Coen (Fargo, Raising Arizona) this is certainly a thriller worth watching. Basically in the 1980's, West Texas, Llewelyn Moss (Planet Terror's Josh Brolin) finds the remains of a drug deal gone violently wrong, as well as a suitcase with $2 million, so obviously he's not telling the cops. Doing this, he now has psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Javier Bardem), who will kill almost anyone that gets in his way, and despairing, quite quiet Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (BAFTA nominated Tommy Lee Jones), are both on his tail. There are many intense and gripping scenes as Chigurh gets closer to finding Moss, and there is a lot of blood spill, but the heart of Bell obviously keeps the intensity from becoming too hard to handle. Also starring Woody Harrelson as Carson Wells, Trainspotting's BAFTA nominated Kelly Macdonald as Carla Jean Moss, Garret Dillahunt as Deputy Wendell, Tess Harper as Loretta Bell and Barry Corbin as Ellis. Bardem is superb as the really chilling killer, the ending where Brolin dies, and Bardem gets away, oh, and Jones is talking about some dream he had, is the tiniest bit disappointing. But that doesn't stop this film from being a great thriller from the Coen brothers. It won the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published for the Coen brothers, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Sound Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

Its a very strong film, violent and a little difficult to digest. The reason for the title is not immediately evident but it ends up being perceived with the progress of the narrative. Beginning in a very elegant way, this one develops in a intensely and densely, constructing suspense around the three central characters. The ending, however, seems a little too sudden after so much dramatic tension, and so we get a little dissatisfied and expecting something more that never comes. The central characters are assured by Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem. The three of them were excellent, each in their own way, but Bardem stood out as a villain, with a deep, somber interpretation but holding the entire film around him. I believe that with this film Bardem has proved himself to be a great talent and has a promising future if he knows how to run his career well. The leadership is assured by the Brethren Cohen, in a dense register and away from the sarcastic comedies to which they have accustomed us.",

After viewing it I have to register a negative opinion. From the start, the movie does indeed draw the viewer in to what seems to promise to be a pretty good - and very well made - action, adventure, mystery (&c &c &c) flick. We do, however, sense a dichotomy here. One part of the movie seems to want to be an action thriller, as the bad guy tracks the good guy and we all get enthralled with who will outsmart the other. I just wish they had followed this line through to a logical conclusion. The other half of the movie seems to be devoted to enshrining Tommy Lee Jones on Mt. Rushmore, and pursuing some sort of barren vision of the Old West, with dry, acerbic, minimalist dialogue that seems at odds with the advanced firepower of the two guys trying to kill each other. I like Tommy Lee Jones, but it seems sad that he is content to make movies where the producers know that his wizened visage and past filmic history will draw viewers, even if all he does is mutter (and I do mean mutter, in that a lot of his dialogue is unintelligible) formulaic bits of Old West wisdom. Robert Duvall does this sort of thing better and more intelligently. ",
528,30 December 2007,ScottMan-3,6, Now hold on a minute....lets use a little common sense here,"this is the first review i read after returning from a movie that left everyone in the audience completely mystified and scratching their heads in amazement..: ""DO NOT LISTEN TO THE IGNORANT PEOPLE GIVING THIS BAD REVIEWS!!!! They are the people that go to a movie just wanting to see Vin Diesel blow things up, or see Ice Cube babysit. Heaven forbid a movie without a happy ending, one that makes you think about characters and theme....etc,etc"" ......in short, the individual who wrote the review i just quoted is clearly reviewing it from a bizarrely different perspective that does NOT address storytelling basics; i mean, HOW,...HOW on this planet does someone come out of that movie talking like this:........""Such a complex film requires deep thinking. While the plot itself isn't too complicated, the characters are multi-dimensional, and the themes are subtle, in a way that some people may not understand."" I don't think there is anyone reading this review (of mine) that is going to want to continue reading an unending rant and rave (and i don't wanna write it) so,i am going to get straight to the point. The movie DID have some terrific moments,but when you string a series of moments together for 2 hours and the storyline does not offer up some basic sets of logic (like a more impressive law enforcement effort after a cop is killed) you come to expect in our age of senseless violence, there is still an audience, sitting there (no matter how smart or stupid they are),waiting for some small semblance of ""cohesion"" in a story...to give a hint that the people IN the story are not soooooooooo far disconnected with all of the things in the world that the audience sees in their everyday life. the bottom line is that this movie has so much stubborn incoherence and ""detraction"" from any sense of conclusion or closure on many parts of it that there is an inevitable deep sense of storytelling betrayal that has absolutely nothing to do with the argument that it should be recognized for ""a complex film requiring deep thinking""...",

It has a good story-line that kept my interest. I even watched all the way through the damage that an air-hose can do to a body (and a lock).
Javier Bardem is far too good at playing an unhinged man on a mission. Who among us can resist the laconic Tommy Lee Jones as he tries to catch up with Bardem's character but is so tired, feeling so old and wanting so desperately to retire and live a peaceful, quiet existence?
I watched with such intensity and interest, sure that Josh Brolin's character would get to live out his dream with his wife, that Bardem's character would be killed in a hail of bullets and Tommy Lee Jones' character would continue on as Sheriff.
Nothing is ever as it seems when the Coen Brothers are involved, as I should of remembered. When suddenly The End occurred, I said out loud ""That's it?"" ""that's the end?"". I was a little peeved but now 2 days later, looking back, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the Movie and the ending was 'just as it should be'.",

The closest thing one can compare this movie are some very few people who can manage to tell a story without raising their voices, without any added drama, and with a calm and steady storytelling still manage to raise every single hair on your back.

537,16 March 2008,iamingozi,6, No Country for Very Much Anymore,"I have to say that this movie was intriguing, full of surprises and more violent than I expected. And although I suppose I understand the intentions of the plot, as convoluted as it was, I am kind of disheartened that it won so many academy awards. It's not just that it was full of errors (check the goof section), nor is it that in my own humble unprofessional opinion that although Javier Bardem was great, I saw no acting that was worth the award - I just don't think the role was written well enough to support it. But most of all, I really don't know what to make of anything anymore when a film of such overwhelming violence is put on such a coveted pedestal. Yes, I am aware that there have been other violent movies that have won, and maybe it is just the sad revelation that as I get older, what we see as entertainment - strike that - what we see as THE BEST of entertainment, is still nothing more than useless violence that carries with it no repercussions for the guilty. The film industry rarely gives us what we need, but feeds us over the top with what we shouldn't have; glorifying theft, betrayal, greed, and as we see in our latest best picture, murder. Maybe I'm just getting older, I don't know. Personally I can handle the violence and all the other garbage, but I also believe the more graphic and blatant our so called entertainment becomes, the less value it must have. But as I said, this is just my unprofessional opinion, so I'll end this ""review/rant"" with this; if you are in the mood for a story full of death, some of it implied, some of it right there for you to enjoy - and if you are itching for a movie with no happy or justifiable ending, leaving you feeling like you went on a ride that was supposed to be the best ever but was really just sitting in your car parked in your garage with the motor running, then by all means...Enjoy!",

Then with less that a half hour to go, they did the darndest thing. They dipped out of my hero's story, at the climax of all places..in an edit that looked and felt like a bad projectionist had just changed reels. It was, as I've read here and elsewhere, a move in keeping with the style of the novel. The choice to tell the story in this way was apparently one of those form equals theme moves like Beckett's Waiting For Godot. I spent the better part of an hour chewing it over with my girlfriend.

The underrated Josh Brolin is impressive as the Vietnam veteran who stumbles across a drug deal gone murderously wrong, while Tommy Lee Jones is exceptional as the policeman who overviews the case in its bloody entirety. Maybe not worthy of all the awards it received (particularly Best Picture/Director), but an intoxicating affair overall.",

(I'm pretty sure that I have stayed at one of the hotels in Las Vegas, New Mexico that served as one of them) Some memorable dialog, that may have been lifted from the McCarthy novel. Some of the extreme nihilism was a bit off-putting, but that was obviously the point. A big problem was the ending. I hate to criticize a film for being unconventional, because formulaic endings can be bad, too. There is definitely a place for films with ambiguous or undeveloped endings, although that place is usually in French art-house cinema. I did find it in need of more of a point.

The entire movie is ridiculous and if you stick around to see a payoff at the end between the protagonist and antagonist you wasted your time because there is none. One of my biggest problems with this movie is how easily everybody is able to find Llewelyn Moss. Even with the transponder it seemed like Anton had a stroke of luck to pass close enough to the bag for the transponder to start beeping. How the heck was Anton right on his heels at the next hotel - Llewelyn should have been out of range. And how was anyone able to find him after he got rid of the transponder and got into Mexico, not only did Anton find him but so did Woody Harrelson (or maybe Anton was following Woody, but I don't see how that could happen either). Anyhow seeing as this movie was something like #40 on the IMDb all time best and a Coen brothers movie I expected to be in for a real treat, instead I got a movie that doesn't make much sense and has no payoff at the end.

566,3 February 2012,dmdavidsonhome-267-593710,10, One of the best films I have ever seen,"No Country for Old Men is one those rare films that I not only never tire of watching, but actually seems to improve with each viewing. I have found that some people have not taken the time to see it simply because of the violent content. What a great shame and pity that they would miss out on and deny themselves a truly marvelous viewing experience. I don't recall people staying away from The Godfather because of the violence. To me it is not the violence but the sense of menace and dread that makes No Country for Old Men such a tension-filled nail biter and a truly edge-of-your-seat film. Everyone I have talked to who has actually seen it used the words "" very tense"" and ""it kept me on the edge-of-my-seat"". Javier Bardem's ""Anton Chigurh"" is the greatest screen villain since ""Hannibal Lecter"". Tommy Lee Jones played a very understated character in ""Sheriff Ed Tom Bell"", who is the conscience of the film. Josh Brolin was also excellent and vastly underrated as ""Llewelyn Moss"", the hunter who unwittingly becomes the hunted. The lovely Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald is also great in an all-too-small role as ""Carla Jean Moss"" (""Llewelyn""'s wife). She does a flawless West Texas accent. Woody Harrelson is also superb as the somewhat mysterious ""Carson Wells"", who we never really learn a lot about. Gene Jones is so superb and so memorable as a country store proprietor in a truly unforgettable scene. The Coen Brothers did a splendid job of adapting the book to the big-screen and their casting of even the smallest roles was flawless. I would not recommend reading the book by Cormac McCarthy before watching the film, as it would spoil some of the film's surprises. However I found that the book did clear up some of the things that the film did not explain in full detail. A great film based on a great book. It has fast become one of my favorites and I always recommend it to everyone I know who hasn't seen it. And the film's Oscar-winning cinematography by Roger Deakins makes it well-worth getting the Blu-Ray version and watching it on a big screen. The harsh and inhospitable West Texas landscape makes for a stunning background. No Country for Old Men may not be a perfect film but it comes as close as any I have ever seen in my nearly 53-years.",

With their latest, No Country for Old Men, they have excelled at personal film-making that just misses the mark by not delivering a more pronounced ending. Under the trappings of a mystery and then chase thriller, this film is an exercise in movie making at its best while taking chances with conventional characters and plot. It also features splendid performances by Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem. ",

This time they have gone to an established work of fiction, unlike previous original screenplays, although it seems to me Cormac McCarthy's novel was written for them. In many respects this is a perfect companion piece to their own ""Fargo"", (they would make a splendid double-bill); they both deal in cold-hearted killers, in botched crimes, they both have a philosophical sheriff whose wisdom, nevertheless, seems to emanate from fortune-cookies and they share the same grisly sense of humour.

And really, how does Woody find Moss in 3 hours? I can buy a character being evil and pointlessly doing evil things. I can even buy a character doing stupid things (going back to give the practically-dead drug dealer a drink of water before he dies, running back into the hotel where the madman is to see if the hotel clerk is OK, and on and on and on).

The action bits are great and, I got to admit, were designed superbly. The execution also considers the night factor nicely that the dark of the night doesn't reduce the quality of action despite they're using less lights such as muzzle flashes. The acting is just superb. All thumbs up for Javier Bardem's performance. He really nailed his role greatly. Josh Brolin also acted out great, although still his performance is not as great as Bardem's due to he played a character which he already used to depict.

The movie was moving at a good pace with ""the good guy"" Josh Brolin evading the silent psycho killer Anton. It was a cat and mouse game and the viewers were left ultimately rooting for Brolin even though his character had no real depth and we never really got a feel for him. That was what was really wrong with this movie, it had a bunch of random characters that were not developed, and we didn't care about them. Take the always awesome Woody Harrellson. What the heck was he doing in this movie? We see him come into an office and crack some jokes with a guy behind the desk and then he starts tracking the ""bad guy"" to supposedly stop him from slaughtering more people. Well, he finds Brolin in a hospital in Mexico and ten minutes later he gets killed sitting in a hotel room. Pointless role, and it served no purpose. Then just as you feel the movie is coming to a conclusion, we see Josh Brolin lying dead in a hotel room with like 25 minutes left in the movie. The rest of the movie consists of Tommy Lee Jones (who I love)engaging in pointless conversation about dreams, etc. Then the movie just rolls the credits! I was stunned that this movie was able to win best Picture. But I guess it follows along the lines of other sucky movies that win Best Picture.

I'm an Aussie bloke, quite open to influences in movies and broadminded (I like Reservoir Dogs, even Pulp Fiction, Leon/Professional, Bourne movies) but I found this sick. It made me feel like I'd been abused. IMHO its a splatter movie, with sadistic touches done with callous fetishistic relish by the Coens, and IMHO illustrates a debased cinematic sense. Tommy Lee Jones is misused and is cast IMHO to pull in suckers like us who enjoy movies and remember other better roles he's done. It's a schizoid movie with story line of Tommy Lee Jones as an old fogy speaking Texas patois with other Texans in accents so thick that you need a chainsaw to cut to the meaning. That stream is worthwhile; I thought of Last Picture show, Paris Texas, Fargo etc. and a hundred other movies - derivative but OK. The other stream is some loathsome splatter movie, with surgically graphic blood, killing, sewing up of wounds, violence done by a psycho killer - like a mail order catalog of death, blood and viscera.

If you think Columbine is exciting or an allegory for modern times and enjoy mass murder movies then this is for you.

The story is strong especially early on, though it frays a little bit as the bodies start piling up. Great performances from Javier Bardem (the psycho), Josh Brolin (the Vietnam vet who stumbles across drug money), and Tommy Lee Jones (the world-weary sheriff, who seems resigned to man's degeneration). Unfortunately Kelly Macdonald's character as the vet's wife is weak, and this is an overly masculine film.

He killed his girlfriend, not because he had a motive, but to see what it would feel like. This opening speech sets up No Country For Old Men, the new release from Coen Brothers - Joel and Ethan, which then goes on to explore that baseless type of evil in the form of Javier Bardem's ruthless, mop-topped killer. He plays Anton Chigurh (how you pronounce his last name is dependant on who says it), a stone-faced killer trying to track down a missing bag of drug money, after a deal goes horribly wrong in the Texan desert. Josh Brolin's local simpleton Llewellyn Moss is the man who took the money after stumbling across the aftermath of the deal-gone-wrong.

In those Clint Eastwood-esque Westerns, there are always the moral law-abiding protagonists hunting down and confronting outlaws, and ending in an epic duel. But everything the old timers think they know are all gone as society progresses in an age of urbanization and technocracy. And the cinematography of the film showcases a cold and somewhat dark and devoid sense to it contrast to a more uplifting and positive like the older Western eras.",

The acting by Josh Brolin is great and works very well for the character. The Hunter and prey concept works so well at the start and is pretty awesome to see how both characters react to the situation. The second half, man was it disappointing, a big event takes place that really wasn't focused on very much and then the movie is an absolute mess. Tommy Lee Jones is dreadful in this role, he is so extremely boring and I have no idea why he is projected as the main character as he adds absolutely nothing to the plot. I've also seen that people that the ending was spectacular. It's so abrupt and absurdly slow at the same time and has no real effect left for me as a viewer, not only that but it is so unsatisfactory and left me feeling dead inside.

The antagonist kills everyone he works with for no reason at all, ergo he cares for absolutely nothing except the chase in and of itself, and killing annoying people that he dislikes for being nice or for being in his way. I see nothing deep with his character, no menace, just a person that is so obsessed with his inner mental world, and the good reviews for this movie in turn obsess with him being mysterious and evil itself. To quote Woody Harrelson's character, he's just insane. No happy ending, no investment in any character expect for the main character that had an offscreen death. The chase scenes brought tension, and that was the only redeeming quality of this movie. I have no clue what Tommy lee Jones character's point was. A sad sheriff that felt unfullfilled at the end of his career and faces retirement? This movie was so shallow. I can see exactly everything they wanted to tell with this movie, and I wonder if the writers/directors have any clue to what the world is really like., and I'm saying that because it felt like they wanted to tell a ""real"" story, of how things don't turn out like they do in the movies. Some people will find this deep or enjoyable, but that leaves me wondering if those people watch too many movies to differentiate between what is real or not. In any case, you won't find a character like Anton in the real world, because after he pissed of the first gangster he'd never find work again or be shot. I don't buy that he shoots everyone he works with. I don't buy that the characters just finds eachother all the time without effort.

It never ceases to amaze me how quickly the local police in the Austin area where I live can come up with a suspect or make an arrest soon after a murder when there was no indication at first of who might have committed it. Yet in this movie the police are dumb or overcome with ennui or malaise that they can't capture or even track down someone who is so obviously on the loose and deadly. Especially after he killed the deputy early in the movie you'd think every cop in Texas would be on the lookout for him. So you just keep watching, wondering how dumber the people can be.

""Which country does this film occur in and why is it such a place that the mere presence of an old man would quintessentially bring the earth's atmosphere into a place nie oblivion shall I put it bluntly, as a matter a fact is the cosmos now into question not just the Milky Way galaxy?"". Yes I know there was likely a lot of questions in a short amount of time that probably wrung from your head ear to ear like the marble devices placed delicately on the desk of a doc tore. But rest assured these questions are merely an apparition in the pre frontal cortex. This film is most likely the greatest of its kind as it not only features the likes of Timothy Lee jones from the classic ""men in black"", Javier Bardem who played the maniacal and dastardly ""Captain Armando Salazar"" in Pirates of the Carribean, and Joshua Brolin aka ""Thanos"", but it also includes a slew of technical and intellectual assets that make it a first of its kind. Just look at the scene where Brolin is forced to move the Case of rupees into another room so that Bardem cannot find it, or when Bardem attempts to end the life of Brolin in a twisted way by using the placed tracking device in the case of rupees to find the exact location of sir Brolin. These are just a couple of examples of the expertise and craftsmanship that the Coen brothers put into play to make one of if not the most interesting and well crafted cinema reels this side of the Bartlett Deep. 10/10 would recommend to my childrens childrens childrens childrens friends grandfathers children you know the one that bought the yellow traveling device?

640,24 September 2017,philipperousseau1,10, Don't eat popcorn while watching this movie because it's too awesome,"The worst movie to see while eating popcorn: No Country for Old Men (Coen brothers, 2007). The reason is simple: you hear no music for the two hours that it lasts. This film is made that you should appreciate every single noise you hear in it. Starting truck, shots, wind sounds, door squeaking, etc. So I pity the people who saw this movie in a movie theater, a place that tends to irritate attentive moviegoers due to people sitting in the first row who whisper to the person sitting next, or the guy all alone in the back who plunges his hand into his bag of chips. But it is precisely on this aspect that the film shines: its absence of music, and therefore on what remains of what human hearing can perceive by viewing the film; the sound. The film is absent of music, but it is just as if there was one. One can listen to the single musical piece during the end credits, but the dialogues are so powerful that the film does not need to clutter with music. Sometimes long scenes take place without a note of music or even dialogues, but it is precisely this silence that makes the film so captivating. The trio of actors represented on the cover (Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones) is perfect. Although the character of the sheriff, embodied by Tommy Lee Jones, experienced actor, seemed a bit more shadowed than the others, although he plays a key role in the plot. One wonders why the face of Woody Harrelson is not on the poster of the film. The impeccable Bardem's acting (recipient of the Oscar of the best actor) is of a prodigious originality. Each of the quotes of the character he incarnates (Anton Chigurh) is absolutely awesome. What to say about the scene where he shoots heads or tails with the cashier of the convenience store. It feels like he will shoot him in the head every moment, but he prefers to argue with the old man while eating peanuts. Finally, what to say about the photo montage, if not that every shot is framed to perfection and that a monk's patience had to be necessary to turn in these magnificent external decorations. Visually, this film is a work of art that surpasses any other low-range action thriller, despite an intrigue that would tend to qualify as ""typical"" cat and mouse play, which we have already seen a thousand times in Hollywood cinema. But it is the production of the Coen brothers that ranks No Country... above all the others. The film won the Oscar for the best film and deserves it, because it's too perfect.",

They make very good vignettes I think, and some scenes in this film make nice little stand-alone pieces of cinema but, overall, they don't give a damn about the film as a whole. It has been put together clumsily and without feeling. The characters are essentially 2D, the plot has big holes in it and many plot lines, big and small, just peter out or are not resolved. Stupid things like the hero deliberately leaving his car half-a-mile away from the death scene in a pitch-black desert and walking the rest of the way merely so the next scene with the bad guys can take place. The killer seen waiting in the motel room for the sheriff to create tension but then, oh, he isn't because it was, what? a flashback? the sheriff's imagination? a cinematic artifice? The philosophizing of the characters, especially the sheriff, is supposed to be deep and meaningful I guess but is more like Monty Python dialogue. Following the hero intensely and then having his final scene off-camera may be 'clever' film-making but it is deeply unsatisfying. It is very contrived, especially they way they flag-wave it as an 'intellectual' film but not answering any questions the viewer may have such as what happened to the money, what happened to the wife, what happened to the bad guy, etc.. Scene-after-scene, from beginning to end, was deliberately left without a conclusion; it became tiring after a while and you begin to think ""why am I watching this scene?

This exploration of evil, law, Religion, fate and morals wrapped up in a nail biting cat and mouse thriller is a masterpiece and one of the decade's best movies. Some will dislike it due to its blunt refusal to stick to conventions. It has something on an anti-climax.

That would never happen like someone else pointed out police, FBI, CBI never ever on the hunt for a guy who kills how many a day? It puts a new meaning to suspending your disbelief.

This is a film with no central character/protagonist but its not exactly what I'd call an ensemble piece. The most memorable character could easily be called the villain, but can you have a villain w/o a ""hero""? Perhaps thats (one of) the point(s) to the film. The over all feeling I'm left with by the time the credits roll (btw love the font used during the credits) is best described by that wonderful line from Natural Born Killers ""The whole world's comin' to an end"". Now of course thats not to meant in a revelations kind of way but more in the curmudgeonly old man complaining about the damn kids and how things were different/better when he was a boy. The film seems like one long version of that...but in the best possible way. Its a film that manages to be several things though not all at once. It's a thriller that is at times pensive. There is no big bang climax though you might be expecting one. I wasn't particularly disappointed by this fact because by the time it got to the logical point where a big bang climax would have gone (if this were another film) I sort of understood that wasn't the point. What is the point though, im certain it has something to do with violence. Has its gotten worse or is it always been this bad? I haven't quite figured it out yet but I'm rather fond of any film that doesn't telegraph its message to the audience. Or maybe I'm just dince and it does. Never the less I'm happy to watch this film many times over and think about it. At the end of the day maybe thats the point.",

It's a little unnerving watching him intimidate people he encounters, but there's also something about him that convinces you, this man would survive. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones somehow share the true center of the film, giving it the heart and familiarity we need to get entangled with Bardem.

It is not a great film, merely better than the competition -- and Javier Bardem makes for a really scary villain who kills for pleasure as well as for professional reasons. Tommy Lee Jones, a tired lawman, Josh Brolin as a hunter who stumbles across a failed drug deal and takes away $2 million in cash, and Woody Harrelson as a cool private operator on Bardem's trail all do their jobs well but if you have nightmares they will be filled by Bardem's character. For my money, Bardem's performance was superior to Daniel Day-Lewis' overrated acting in ""There Will Be Blood."" 2007 was not the banner film year that many critics claimed it was and ""No Country for Old Men"" is not a great film, merely another triumph for the Coen Brothers, who are possibly the most interesting scriptwriters and directors in the business on this side of the Atlantic.",

I had a second chance to see it on the big screen so last night I jumped at the opportunity and me and my brother sped to the theater and managed to see it. That was the first movie I saw in theaters in 2008, and let me say, it set the bar rather high for the other movies I will see in theaters in 2008. That movie was great. The acting was perfect. Every character was great and well-played. Even the bad guy was good, you even wanted him to make it at times just so you could see him more. Tommy Lee Jones is still a great actor. Although he threw me off at times, sometimes he seemed senile, others he seemed like the most sane guy in the world. Javier Bardem was excellent as the insane Anton Chigurh. Josh Brolin gave his best performance I think as Lewellyn Moss. Even Woody Harrelson changed my opinion with an unforgettable performance as the sharp Carson Wells. The storyline wasn't really original, but the Coen brothers managed to change it, add twists to it and whatnot and make it into something completely new. The only flaws with this movie were A. The timing. Some scenes went way too fast or were skipped completely. Other scenes dragged on a bit. Also the ending was VERY confusing, I had to look up the FAQ to fully get it.

I had never read the acclaimed 2005 novel by author Cormac McCarthy, the basis of the film, but it's obvious that the story ambiguities, philosophizing tone and eccentric side characters were key draws for the idiosyncratic Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel, who again wrote and directed together as a team. Immediately familiar are the dark sensibilities that make an arid-looking West Texas a most unlikely place for a noir-type thriller, but the Coens' rich sense of character and place are certainly evident. At the same time, the relentless chase in the movie is so dominant that there is little time for them to showcase the quirky sense of humor that makes 1996's ""Fargo"" a modern classic.

Josh Brolin as Llewellyn, a poor veteran who stumbles upon 2 million dollars, Javier Bardem as Anton Chirguh, a sociopath who is after the money and will let nothing get in his way. Bardem gives the best performance because he is so inhumane but attempts to have mercy. He is one of the scariest villains I have ever seen. Lastly Tommy Lee Jones as Ed Tom Bell, the sheriff who follows their footsteps. The film is mostly told through Jones's character, but all three characters have their own moments where they are telling the story. Every year comes a film that makes you grip your seat. This is the one. The whole movie feels so real as Brolin and Bardem play cat-and-mouse with one another. Part of the reality is that there is no music, and there is no soundtrack playing in the background in real life, and without the music you feel more in the movie, like it is happening to you.

The film has a certain style, charm and menace, and the Coen's certainly deserve credit for sticking with a story that emphatically rejects any sort of populist ending. But at the end of the day, it's a film about a psychopathic killer; and for all its undoubted class, I've seen enough of those before. While it's true that this particular killer is not so much human as a form of devil come to pass judgement on who should live and who should die, this idea is also less original that it sounds (most films about psychopaths attempt to play this idea, albeit few as successfully as this one). I have to confess that I've never quite understood why most of the Coen's films are so well regarded; they're certainly clever, and refreshingly non-mainstream; but I don't find them that hilarious and they're shallower than they affect. I liked watching this movie; but I didn't see greatness.",
706,3 December 2007,JackCerf,7, Fatalism and Quietism,"The Coens have withheld the dramatic resolution that the setup promises: There is no final confrontation between Moss and Chigurh or Bell and Chigurh. Somebody else kills Moss, Chigurh evades Bell, and it isn't even completely clear, though it is hinted, whether Chigurh recovers the money. Instead, Chigurh kills an innocent because his peculiar idea of integrity requires him to, and he is himself almost undone by a random act of fate, while Bell decides that the world has simply gotten too hard for him to deal with any more. That may be how things work out in real life, but drama is supposed to impose a structure that real life lacks. The Coens willfully refuse. (Since I haven't read the novel, I don't know how much it dictates that decision. Even if it does, the Coens decided to use that novel as the material for the movie, rather than something else.)",
707,21 November 2007,jaredmobarak,9, Got some hard bark on that oneNo Country for Old Men,"While No Country for Old Men is not a perfect film, it is masterfully crafted and orchestrated to brilliant effect. My only reservation here is the lethargic pace in a few moments, but mostly the ending that seems to go on for about ten minutes too long. I will fault that with the brothers' adapting process of Cormac McCarthy's novel. We are able to drop so many characters throughout the proceedings without a second thought, that the necessity to go back to Sheriff Bell at the end was a bit too out of place, waxing poetic for pretension sake. Otherwise, there is very, very little not to like.",

Now I thoroughly enjoyed ""Gladiator"" and if I had to list what I personally felt was the Academy's biggest mistake in Best Picture, I think I would select 2007's winner ""No Country for Old Men."" First of all, let me state that my giving this Oscar-winner a negative review, that I am standing very far away from the majority. Most people who have seen ""No Country for Old Men"" would describe it as a masterpiece; a modern-day classic with truly marvelous suspense. Well, I've seen the film and I would describe it was neither a classic, nor very suspenseful. And I know that by panning this film, that my review will be the subject of user criticism and probably, for some, proof of my worthlessness as a reviewer. But I sat down to watch ""No Country for Old Men"" with high expectations and had the time of my life with the first half-hour, but soon lost interest after that and ultimately I resulted in feeling the movie was in a word: mediocre. Very well-made, but mediocre.",
713,30 December 2007,Philby-3,7, The Coen universe is a scary place,"This latest bloody drama from the Coen Brothers has had a mixed reception and my reaction was mixed also. As they have stuck fairly closely to the original book by Cormac McCarthy, the improbabilities and loose ends are not theirs alone. But the way the story is told, with the outcome of some key scenes left up in the air, and the sudden disposal of key characters, is, frankly, playing with the audience. This is not a movie that stands up well to post-screening analysis. On the other hand, assisted by the harshly beautiful US South West, the cinemaphotography is gorgeous. There are three absolutely stand-out performances, plenty of tension, and a moral message. Though it is a drama rather than a comedy there's also the trademark Coen Bros wry humour, though there is a good deal less here than in, say, ""Fargo"".",

716,21 November 2015,heisenberg12,6, Don't get your hopes up,"This movie starts out very good. All of the scenes are well done and shot at a high level. The acting is very good too. As the movie unfolds, it definitely keeps your interest and remains compelling. In the beginning, you overlook some flaws because of the amusement, good acting, and entertainment, thinking they are going to be a bare minimum. But as you progress towards the end, one major big flaw keeps arising, and it starts to become a joke and the film loses credibility. In a nutshell, ask yourself, ""How can a serial killer who has been known and found out from the very start of the film, in an age of radio, television, and phones just go wherever he wants whenever he wants and nobody recognizes him or reports him? How can the FBI and police force not catch up to him after all those days and weeks?"" Haha. It's hilarious. If you think about it, it is one of the stupidest plot holes and oversights you might have ever seen. And this is just the tip of it. You can go into more details too. I say, ""It's like he's the ""invisible man"""". Then there is how everyone he is out to get acts stupid and have no powers that most humans have intellectually. They lack reasoning skills. Moss, at times, does, but only at times, and eventually he succumbs to the stupid nature anyone who isn't a serial killer seems to possess. Lol. It's a good movie, but the lack of realism in the story that this guy just keeps getting away with everything is ridiculous and way too far fetched. Last but not least, you will absolutely hate the main character, and when you view the end, because you hate him so much, and watch him get away from law enforcement for the 100th time (like they don't exist Lol), there's a good chance you should and will hate this film. Still, professionally, it is a well made movie with good acting, cinematography, and overall interesting story so 6/10. You want to like these overrated Hollywood movies, but they just always seem to let you down.",
717,17 February 2014,philthegreatone-786-63058,9, Dark Masterpiece,A local trouble maker called Llewelyn Moss played by Josh Brolin stumbles on a drug deal gone wrong. He finds 2 million dollars in a case. He has no idea that a serial killer played by Javier Bardem is after that money. The film becomes a cat and mouse game between Brolin and Bardem. Bardem is chilling in this supporting role. He is a killer who can't be reasoned with. The direction from the Coen's is masterful. So many well crafted quiet scenes where you are holding your breath explode into violence. The screenplay was so well done and constructed very well. You are on the edge of your seat most of the film. Tommy Lee Jones is also great as sheriff trying to track down Bardem and warn Brolin's character. The cinematography is amazing to look at. The performances were great. Especially Bardem in the Oscar winning supporting role. It totally deserved best picture at the Oscars for 2007. I highly recommend this film.,
718,14 May 2020,alexismaria02,10, A masterpiece,"Have you ever had the feeling of witnessing something beyond special while watching a film? Well, that is exactly what you are going to feel while watching ""No country for Old Men"". The film is nearly flawless in almost every aspect and manages to capture your attention from the first few fine shots of the movie. The film focuses its attention on 3 main characters and all of them are incredible well built. Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh is one of the best psychopath in the history of cinema, without a doubt. Every single thing about his character is so mesmerizing to watch and although he is the villain, he still manages to reach your heart. Every time he is on screen he inspires nothing but fear and anxiety, which is exactly what a ""perfect"" villain should do. Also, the first scene we have with Bardem's character is one of the best character introduction ever. Josh Brolin is also amazing as Anton Chigurh antagonist, Llewelyn Moss. Then, Tommy Lee Jones did an absolutely fantastic job as the sheriff.
The cinematography in this particular film was unbelievably good. Also, this is one of the best work by the Coen brothers, who managed to deliver such a great story with an impecable directing.
I totally recommend this film with all my heart, as it is a masterpiece from the beginning till the end!!",
719,19 May 2009,HelloTexas11,8," exciting, thought-provoking Coen Brothers' film","A riveting and intense movie, 'No Country for Old Men' can apparently be seen on a couple of levels. I'm afraid I only saw it on one, that of a conventional chase/thriller done with style and intelligence, with some unexpected twists and turns. It's also quite gory and violent; it would be hard to argue though that the violence here does not add to the film's characters and its story. Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh ranks right up there with Robert Mitchum's Max Cady ('Cape Fear') and Dennis Hopper's Frank ('Blue Velvet') as one of the creepiest, most malevolent bad guys ever to stalk across the silver screen. Like those classically evil characters, he is relentless and ubiquitous, seemingly impossible to kill and without a shred of conscience. Chigurh exists for one reason: to kill in cold blood again and again. Virtually none of the people he kills pose any sort of threat to him personally; he could find out what he wants and be on his way, but it appears that if someone has seen him and spoken to him, a code of sorts within him demands the person be killed. Yet occasionally, the person isn't, for reasons never made clear. A couple of times in the movie, he lets a coin toss decide a person's fate. Chigurh's prey in 'No Country for Old Men' is Llewelyn Moss, played with taciturn toughness by Josh Brolin. I think the main thing that makes this story work is the fact that Moss is almost a match for Chigurh. While many of the rest of the people we meet in the film are simply mowed down by Chigurh, Moss proves to be a cunning and resourceful foe, at one point even turning the tables on the seemingly invincible executioner and shooting HIM. The third main character is Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. As always, Jones is fascinating to watch and gives a fine performance, but I found myself wondering how many times he's played the same role. 'The Fugitive,' 'U.S. Marshals,' 'The Client,' even 'Men In Black'... they're all essentially the same character, a cranky but endearing authority figure with a droll sense of humor. It's a character that wears well though, and nobody does it better than Jones. Here he is investigating the murders and Moss' disappearance though he stands apart from the action, wryly commenting on the case and life in general while never actually encountering Chigurh. The plot concerns Moss chancing upon a satchel with two million dollars in it at the scene of an apparent shootout between two rival Mexican drug gangs, at a remote spot in West Texas. All the gang members are dead save one who is badly wounded. Moss makes off with the money but quickly discovers others are after him to recover it. Chigurh works for one of the gangs as their prime hit-man and thus begins his pitiless and unrelenting cross-state pursuit of Moss and the stolen loot. Moss ingeniously escapes time and again, and Chigurh just as ingeniously tracks him down to his next hiding place. (Pity the poor motel clerks wherever Moss chooses to hole up; they almost always fall victim to Chigurh.) The ending is 'unconventional,' as they say, but hey, it's a Coen Brothers' film... what do you expect? I'll leave the existential explanations of 'what it all means' to someone else and say, to me, the lesson of 'No Country for Old Men' is that nobody just forgets about two million dollars.",
720,22 December 2011,clarem-7,10, Logic to a fault,"No music. The sound we can sometimes hear is like the pulsating of a gong. The impression it conveys is that of waves spreading in circles on a still water surface after it has been disturbed by an object. It is heard whenever the characters are confronted with the results of their past decisions – the waves' inexorable advance, often stirred far back in the past. Naturally, people try to influence this course, but the best they can do is confuse the pattern – in the end, the waves will hit the shore.. The symbol for this type of fate is Chigurh: ""You've been putting it up – your whole live .. The coin has been traveling twenty-two years to get here."" All who have to deal with him try to change the course of events but only manage to disrupt the pattern: Moss cunningly escapes several traps while sheriff Bell remains in constant pursuit, unable to catch up with his ""ghost"". We must accept that our decisions will have uncontrollable effects in the future – we are part of this world and we have not much influence on what is coming. Maybe Chigurh made his decision during the war which convinced him that mankind obeys its rules and morals only to its own convenience. ""If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?"" It seems that his logical conclusion is to leave the system of rights and responsibilities and to refuse the abstract world of human ideas and values which make our society work. What we can learn: think ahead of what might follow your actions and then make the right decision – you won't be able to correct your mistakes later. Don't even try to ""get back what's been taken from you"" – lingering in the past won't help, ""you can't stop what's coming. Ain't all waiting on you ... That's vanity."" Thankfully, this film leaves us the freedom to judge for ourselves: we perceive things close up, from the characters' points of view and no music guides and influences our perception of the events.",

724,24 February 2012,eric_clapton1955,10, excellent,"This movie is one of the best I have seen and it is all due to the psychological killer Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. There is no real logic in his actions as he uses a coin in his decision making process (especially when he is going to kill somebody). He does this in a very cold way as if it is a matter of deciding in which restaurant am I going to eat today. This is something that I think gives him strength as he never doubts his actions, there is no second guessing. Of course this is a very sick individual. But there is a twist which I am not going to reveal here. Also the move hides a powerful message between the lines. For me it has a deep meaning when it comes to faith and chance.

One of the characteristics of Coens' films is that they tend to be too much up in the air and that they try too hard to create this quirky vibe, both of which contribute to unnaturalness of their works.

It seems boring, the ending drags on too long and then ends abruptly and there's random scenes that don't seem to have much bearing on the plot. However it will stay with you to the point you will feel compelled to watch it again. This is exactly what happened with me and on second viewing I loved it. I admired the risks the film took, the excellent performances(especially jabber bardem), the tense and taught film making and the scenes that annoyed me the most upon first viewing became my favourites. That final scene where Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) tells his wife of the two dreams he had punctuated by complete silence except for the ticking of a clock as the film cuts to black is a scene that will stay with me for a long time. The film is brimming with complexity as it explores the ideas of the criminal mind and how warped it has become and the good men of the world like Ed Tom become outmatched and feel the need to give up. It's depressing yet always compelling thanks to the coems marvellous writing and directing as no scene, no matter how slow, is boring or dull. Even when I first saw it and disliked it I was still stuck to the screen, there was something about it that always hooked my attention even when I wasn't enjoying it, that must be a sign of a truly great film.
