0,23 November 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10, Stunning,"I am a huge Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki fan, and My Neighbour Totoro is no exception. In fact it is one of my favourites from them. There are so many wonderful things about My Neighbour Totoro. It is very simple in story and character but it is all very beautiful, charming and touching. The animation is typical Ghibli, ethereal-looking and just ravishing to watch, while the music is one of my favourite scores in a Ghibli film. The story is simple, but I loved the simplicity, it had such a pleasant atmosphere to it, and the characters are engaging with great chemistry together. I have very little to complain about the voice acting either, everybody did a fine job. In conclusion, in my opinion this is an animated classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/
1,15 October 2007,Galina_movie_fan,10, Another miracle from Hayao Miyazaki,"I absolutely agree with Roger Ebert who called ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""One of the most beloved of all family films"". Its colorfully bright and sparkling animation is enchanting. It is incredibly realistic and at the same time makes us along with two main characters, the young sisters ready for a miracle to happen any minute. The gentle story is touching, uplifting, funny, and tender without being overly sentimental or didactic. The film takes place in the early 50s, when 10-year-old Satsuki and her baby sister, curious and energetic 4-year-old Mei spend one summer in an old house in the country side with their University professor father while their mother recovers from a serious illness in the nearby hospital. The great master Hayao Miyazaki remembers well what it is like to be a child, to see magic in the everyday life and be always ready to encounter it. This ability usually disappears as the child becomes adult but it stays forever in a few chosen, and they become the visionary Artists - just like Miyazaki himself. The film is partially autobiographical for the writer/director/storyboard artist. ""When Miyazaki and his brothers were children, his mother suffered from spinal tuberculosis for nine years, and spent much of her time hospitalized. It is implied, yet never revealed in the film, that Satsuki and Mei's mother also suffers from tuberculosis. He once said the film would have been too painful for him to make if the two protagonists were boys instead of girls."" (From the IMDb film trivia)",r

The girls find tiny soot sprites scurrying away from the light. Mei discovers forest spirit Totoro sleeping in a giant tree. The girls are waiting for their father at the bus stop. He's late. Mei is falling asleep when Totoro shows up. Satsuki gives him an umbrella and he's overjoyed. He gives the girls a gift of acorns as he boards the cat-bus.,e

4,1 January 2005,Spectravideo,10, This is a great film!,"There is no compulsory villain in this wonderfully animated film, no moral lessons, no standard blue print story, and the characters will definitely not break out in a song. Thank God! It's simply a great film for all ages. Don't mind if the soundtrack isn't dubbed to your native language, my kids (4 and 6 years old) could easily follow the story with just a few helpers. Japanese is a wonderful language. The film has great direction, beautiful backgrounds and a mystical, pleasant aura throughout. There's nothing like this, I promise you. It's idyllic, for the most part, but still with an exciting story that unfolds into something very unexpected.",i

11,13 February 2005,billf7,10, The kind of film that stays with you afterwards...,"I first watched this film in Japanese with a 12 year old translating for me and I still thought it was incredible. There are so many wonderful touches, like a tin can in the stream while the kids are fascinated by a fish, or the flying scenes (I'm convinced that Ang Lee thought of Miyazaki when he made The Hulk, just in terms of the jumping scenes) that show a curious mind at work throughout the picture. I also love the sense of magic and innocence (and the lack of violence) which pervades the movie. It is a real antidote from the Disney formula which always involves a villain being trashed at the end. This is a film about the wonder of being a child and experiencing something incredible which adults can't see but recognize nonetheless. It works for any age as well. Enjoy.",4

14,10 June 2007,DICK STEEL,10, A Nutshell Review: (DVD) My Neighbor Totoro (1988),"I have never sat through a complete Hayao Miyazaki animated movie despite all the good vibes, reviews, recommendations I got from friends. Actually I have Spirited Away on DVD just waiting to be watched, but for some reason it still sits on my desk amongst others. Well, a good friend from up north passed me THREE Miyazaki DVDs, and given I'm going to where he is tomorrow visiting someone who mentioned during a visit to the previous movie set, how the scene was reminiscent of My Neighbor Totoro, I thought I'll pop that DVD and give it a watch.",8
15,31 May 2001,Jeremy Bristol,9," A superb, uncynical journey into the imagination. Not so great dubbing, though.","This movie, set in Japan in the early fifties, is director Miyazaki's tribute to his mother (who suffered from tuberculosis, just like Satsuki and Mei's mother), his childhood home, and childhood innocence.  Although some people who watch this movie wonder where the Americans are (this is post-WWII Japan, after all) and why so little screen time is spent on the girls' mother, but that may be partly due to the dubbing.",1
16,29 December 2015,CuriosityKilledShawn,6, Where's the rest of it?,"It pains me to give it an average rating, but the fact that I wanted more of it proves that I was enjoying what we got before it came to an abrupt end.

18,6 May 2009,jzappa,8," Miyazaki's Absolutely Hilarious, Culturally Significant Story of Existence, Location and Expedition, Rather Than Rivalry and Danger.","This culturally significant Kodomo anime has become one of the most endeared of all family films without ever having been much popularized or sponsored, which is a testament to its magic. This is one of the tenderly hand-crafted works of Hayao Miyazaki, perhaps the greatest of the Japanese animators, yet his collaborator at the Ghibli Studios, Isao Takahata, who fashioned Grave of the Fireflies, may be his rival. Miyazaki has not until quite lately used computers to animate his films. They are drawn a frame at a time, the time-honored way, with the master himself providing tens of thousands of the frames.",?
19,15 September 2005,marka_dogg,10, Wonderfully Magical!,"Like all Miyazaki films, this one is absolutely sacred. Some parts are reminiscent of Laputa: Castle in the Sky and Spirited Away (and Alice in Wonderland by extension), but Totoro stands out as probably the most unique of them all.",r
20,17 August 2008,rsa5387,10, Essential Viewing,"I was initially skeptical on the quality of this one, but surprisingly this film was both engaging and beautiful from start to finish. Loosely based on Miyazakis own childhood, My Neighbor Totoro is a simplistic story with a kind of charm, depth, and broad appeal that makes it irresistible. When two girls move to a new farmhouse to be closer to their ailing mother, they have to deal with some of life's more eccentric experiences, that of impending death and incredible magic. At its heart, its about the uninhibited curiosity of childhood, and the innocence in accepting everything without question, to such an extent that magic is a very real reality. The otherworldly in this film, comes in the form of Totoro, an animal spirit who is the guardian of the forest near the girls home. Overall, this film is absolutely spectacular. Kids will love it, though some of the deeper meaning will be lost on them. Adults will also love it, as a nostalgic ride through childhood and for some of the more profound themes running throughout the film. Technically, though made in 1988, the animation in this film looks every bit as stunning today. Totoros forest and the many quiet landscape shots are absolutely gorgeous. Disney, eat your heart out. The film is paced slow, letting the film unfurl at a relaxing pace through its scant 86 minute runtime. The lethargic pace, along with Miyazakis expressive camera pans and attention to detail lend the girls discovery of their home/the forest, the famous cat bus scene, and every moment with Totoro a very 360 degree, hypnotic feel. The new English dub is well done without losing much in translation, retaining the witty and lighthearted exchanges from the original. Overall, this films serves as a great introduction into the world of Miyazaki, and remains a timeless classic in its own right. Miyazakis most lighthearted venture also remains his most introspective and grounded work. Even without the whimsicality of Spirited Away and Kikis Delivery Service, this is by far his most engaging and charming film. Essential viewing.",e
21,6 February 2021,rrfpaf-99858,7," Just an average family story. Well, on LSD.","At first I thought Spirited Away was weird. So imagine spirited away, but with no real plot. I'm telling you, this movie is just weird weird weird. It doesn't help that the Totoro and the cat have really creepy smiles. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed every moment of it! The kids are freaking adorable, the creatures are interesting, and the whole thing left me smiling. But dang that's a weird movie.",f
22,8 September 2020,andyajoflaherty,7, Surreal animated classic,"An early Studio Ghibli effort that is charming and surreal in equal measures, the plot concernes itself with 2 young sisters in post war Japan who have to deal with the stresses of a sick parent, moving house and... soot gremlins. The film also contains bizarre forest spirits which may be rabbits... or dogs... I'm not quite sure, and a cat who is also a bus. Ahh Japan... don't ever change...",_
23,17 November 2017,classicsoncall,7," ""We had such a weird, mysterious, spectacular day!""","Director Hayao Miyazaki has certainly made his mark with the IMDb audience. If I'm not mistaken, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" joins four other of his films in IMDb's Top 250 movies. I've now seen them all, and probably come away from them with ""Howl's Moving Castle"" as the most appealing to me.",=
24,22 January 2004,cosmic_quest,10, Magical film for young and old!,"Hands down, 'My Neighbour Totoro' is far superior to any film ever produced by Disney and that's including my personal favourites 'The Lion King' and 'Hercules'.",t
25,25 April 2008,Tweekums,10, An enchanting story for all ages,My Neighbour Totoro is one of the most enchanting films that I've seen. As one would expect from a film made by Hayao Miyazaki the animation is beautiful and detailed and the story engrossing.,t
26,11 June 2006,Quinoa1984,10," My Neighbor Totoro turned me into a little squish-ball, and I mean that as a compliment","That one line summary refers to, basically, what it feels like to be a kid and get delighted by a story and characters that are (to use an overused word) enchanting. In fact, this film to me represents the kind of enjoyment I had as a very young tot watching the Winnie the Pooh films. It is so in touch with the innocence and escapism of children that it actually works for the adults too. As a man already in his twenties, I was really taken aback by how adorable all of the little woodland creatures are- the ""King"" Totoro, the Cat bus, the other little creatures alongside him- and how it wasn't annoying or nearing that. This is the kind of Japanese-export that puts an entertainment like Pokemon, which is all about conflict and defeat and trying to save the end of everything from some super-chu or whatever, as the fun if shallow stuff that it is. Here is a story that works much more like a fairy tale, where there is almost no real conflicts that are impending or spelling deep trouble, only the exaggerated thoughts and occasionally distraught emotions of kids 4-10 years old. Hayao Miyazaki is really, truly in touch with these feelings that go about with kids like these.",_
27,6 December 2014,Mr-Fusion,9, Pure Magic,"MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO's story is about as simple and wholesome as it gets: two little girls, having just relocated to the countryside, wander off and find strange creatures in the neighboring forest. But this thing is just brimming with heart. I was going to say the little sister (Mei) in her raincoat is the cutest thing ever, but that goes for all of her scenes. And Totoro, the eponymous no-neck cat/rabbit thing, while having no dialog, burst with likable personality. The animation here is nothing short of gorgeous. Even if you don't dig the character designs of Japanese animation, those painterly landscapes, clouds and lush greenery are eye-popping.",u
28,12 June 2010,Rectangular_businessman,10, A masterpiece for all the ages,"Miyazaki has to be one of the greatest and most creative artists and film-makers alive. Creating some of the most well crafted and unique animated features of recent years, Miyazaki makes his film very personally, checking thousands and thousands of the frames himself. To top it off most of his films are made with either very minimal use of or no use of computer animation. While I believe CG animated features are an art and respectable side-genre of animated films, there is something always refreshing about seeing hand-drawn images, especially ones as vibrant and creative as Miyazaki's. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is one of Miyazaki's earliest films as director and what he crafts here is a magical film that proves that plot is not everything. The premise of ""Totoro"" is not bad or stupid, but not the strong point of the film. However, it serves it's purpose, and Miyazaki uses his simplistic plot line to help contribute to the aura he gives his film. As with any Studio Ghibli film the visuals are astounding. The creature designs of the Totoro, his small friends, the elaborate cat bus, and even the human characters is pure magic. One thing that I absolutely love about ""My Neighbor Totoro"", which is really a very minor feature of the film, but an important one. When the young daughter tells her father that she has seen the mystical creature, Totoro, the father does not scoff at her 'fantasy' or tell her that there is no such thing as a Totoro, but instead goes along with her. It's such a breath of fresh air to see a father figure especially in a children's fantasy film believing the wild accusations of his young daughter. It's true that ""Totoro"" doesn't real involve any main conflict, but that is the beauty of it. Towards the end there is a bit of a dilemma, but not to the point where it turns into the typical structure of most kid's flicks. ""Totoro"" relies on enchanting visuals, insightful character writing and charm. So many movies are dark and depressing and while I fully stand behind depressing movies it's nice to see a movie that makes you feel good. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" not only makes you feel good, but it also leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling. If you're a parent I highly suggest you show this film to your children for two reasons. 1) I know that they'll love and 2) it's a movie for little kids that you will thoroughly enjoy as an adult as well.",r
29,21 October 2010,toqtaqiya2,9, Succeeds as an adventure fueled by the innocence and wonder of a little girl.,"This is a difficult film to pigeonhole. It is apparently simple, made up of the tiny, everyday events in a child's life, but unlike many films for and about children, it doesn't ignore the huge shadows those events cast in the imagination. Some critics have said that not much happens in My Neighbor Totoro, but discovering a new world, learning the cycle of nature, and facing up to the fear of death is more than enough action to sustain a film, especially in director Hayao Miyazaki's hands. The film is, of course, breathtakingly beautiful. The action may be small-scale but the vistas are incredible. Joe Hisaishi creates what may well be his greatest ever score, another miracle of seeming simplicity. In terms of story, design, animation, and music, this film achieves its aims so perfectly that it's almost absurd to give it a rating. Miyazaki set the film in the remembered landscape of his own childhood. Never sentimental, never dishonest, never preaching, and never failing to acknowledge the realities of life, he has made a film with more magic in it than any number of wizards and superheroes could create. The film became so popular that Studio Ghibli adopted Totoro as the company mascot.",v
30,15 November 2006,refresh_daemon,8, A remarkably enjoyable film,"I keep watching Studio Ghibli films like this one expecting that in all the films that they've made, there's got to be one that just doesn't hold up. Well, My Neighbor Totoro isn't that one.",
31,17 August 2007,LaserBears,10, Rare Classic,"I watched this movie when I was a kid, and while it never caught my attention as I do other commercial movies, I think it had a quiet and subtle effect on me over the years. Sometimes I think about that film, but I never knew why. So, after watching it again as an adult I realized why this movie stay within me: Totoro is a rare film that manages to capture the essence of a child's emotions and vision without being filtered through the adult's tendency to editorialize it, to insert a moral judgment, or to sugar coat it. Mei's behavior is naked, showing raw happiness as well as anger. Her movements are strong and her voice fierce, she thinks she lives in a world without limitations and not binded by adult's notion of etiquette. Satsuki is at a crossroads between adulthood and what remains of her innocence, we see her anxieties and we identify the world of the movie through her eyes. Totoro's physical characteristic is actually menacing and otherworldly, and our first impression of him (through the girls' eyes) is a natural mix of fear and amazement... the same reaction any human would have when confronting something foreign. But then something magical happens: Totoro moves and behaves just like Mei. We identify with this raw, pure energy of joy and imagination. That Studio Ghibli managed to express this idea visually, through character design, storytelling, and animation, is a rare and special accomplishment. This effect cannot be described during a script meeting with a committee of marketing execs.",
32,14 May 2006,MrVibrating,10, Extremely cute(in a good way!),"If you see a movie like 'My Little Pony', you think ""CUTE!"" and feel like puking. That's a common trait in children's movies today. Too many bright colours, boring and dumbed-down dialog, and tired and boring concepts.",
33,7 March 2006,JTurner82,10, A wonderful Miyazaki masterpiece in either version.,"What more can be said about MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO? Get this movie. Immediately. Without a doubt one of the best animated features ever made, Japan or otherwise, TOTORO is an outstanding original creation from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. It's about two sisters -- Satsuki and spunky little Mei -- moving with their somewhat scatterbrained but loving father to a new home in the Japanese countryside. But the place isn't just deserted; wonders galore lie within their household. Tiny, fuzzy black balls of soot (""Soot Gremlins"") scatter every nook and cranny of the walls, frightened away only by laughter. A tall, luscious camphor tree towers above the other trees in the back yard. And, lastly, the Totoros themselves, absolutely adorable little creatures who look like a cross between a raccoon, rabbit, owl, and guinea pig (a personal bias here, since I owned such a pet who reminds me so much of the Totoros here), live in this very forest, carrying acorns, making huge trees grow at night, and playing ocarinas on the branches of the trees. There is even one really BIG Totoro who sleeps under the tree, so cuddlesome and gentle that you'll swear that he's the equivalent of your pet. Of course, he doesn't just allow Mei to snuggle on his chest. He lets out thunderous roars, shake the ground by jumping with full force, grins as wide as a Cheshire cat (albeit with warmth and generosity), helps others when they're in trouble, and gives acorns wrapped in bamboo leaves in return for gifts. The story isn't all hearts and flowers, however. An emotionally charged subplot involving the sisters' ailing mother (shades of Miyazaki's personal life here) gives TOTORO a dramatic edge. This is particularly evident in the third act, when the girls receive a distressing telegram about their mother. Both Satsuki and Mei are extremely traumatized by this as any real child would be if such a situation occurred in their lifetime. What follows is a tearjerking sequence that builds to a truly happy ending. This mixture of real-life situations, emotions, and magical discoveries found in your nearest back yard make TOTORO feel authentic (even with its fantasy elements). One cannot help but find this quality in any of Miyazaki's films, this one included. ",
34,16 May 2004,rbverhoef,8, A great animated film,"Most animated movies, for children and adults, have a hero or heroes and at least one great villain. With 'My Neighbor Totoro' it is different. This movie shows us a wonderful world of animation without a villain. This does not mean the movie is boring or nothing is happening. A lot is happening. There is comedy, drama and suspense but this movie does not need a villain. The only villain there probably is, is the illness the mother of Satsuki (Noriko Hidaka) and Mei (Chika Sakamoto) suffers.",

38,23 July 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," Easy to watch but, perhaps, just as easy to forget.","'My Neighbour Totoro (1988)' is just a nice film. For the most part, there's absolutely no sense of danger; it's just a story about two innocent young girls exploring their new home, their near-infectious (though very loud) laughter filling almost every scene. It's only in the final act in which some traditional conflict is introduced, but it doesn't last very long. The movie is essentially a sequence of vignettes instead of a conventional narrative. It meanders a bit, by its very nature, but it's never boring. In fact, it's rather charming. Its visuals are fantastic and its atmosphere is, for the most part, oddly calming. Its music is great, too. Of course, it isn't exactly exciting or, even, all that compelling. It's the kind of thing that's easy to watch but, perhaps, just as easy to forget. Still, it's a pleasant experience that often puts a smile on your face. 6/10.",
39,7 February 2011,xtian_durden,10," Miyazaki's best work, simply fantastic!","Hayao Miyazaki didn't go extravagant like he did in his most critically acclaimed works such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. My Neighbor Totoro is simple but still imaginative like all his works, and it is quite simply a masterpiece. Even though Totoro doesn't seems he wanted to be lovable, even though he looks scary because of his huge eyes and large mouth, he remains to be one of the loveliest characters of Hayao Miyazaki, quiet but unforgettable, he is like a Teddy Bear. If Satsuki and Mai was amazed when they saw Totoro the first time, well I'm astonished when I saw the half-cat, half-bus creature, it is magical to see that. He didn't go far in this one, but it's the first film that I've seen from him that has a heart.",
40,6 April 2008,WolfHai,10, A wonderful movie!,"The movie is from Japan and it is 20 years old -- it feels fresh as if done yesterday and there is no cultural barrier whatsoever. The drawings of the landscape are fantastic and are alone worth watching this movie: the reflection of the sun on the leaves of the trees, the reflection of the sky in the rice paddies, the high summer clouds, the flowers detailed and colorful.",
41,25 November 2019,Horst_In_Translation,6, The age of innocence,"""Tonari no Totoro"" or ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is a Japanese animated movie from 1988, so this one is already over 30 years old and it was written and directed by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki for Studio Ghibli and the fact that it is one of his most known works, given his tremendous body of work, shows you how well-received it is to this day. So does the fact that this is in the imdb top250, actually top150 even, as at this point it is at 133. I can't really say anything about the voice actors and actresses here. Probably only Japanese can if at all. However, I watched the German dub anyway and I thought it was good. Just heard a really brief moment of the Japanese original because I was a little late and rewatched the first five minutes at home and I thought the dad's voice sounded a bit older than he was in the movie. But maybe that is just me.",
42,4 June 2005,gracegibson,10, Another Stunning Work from Hayao Miyazaki,"I first saw this movie when I was very, very young. I loved it then and I love it now. It is like a beautiful painting. The visuals are fantastic, the plot charming, and the ""totoros"" are adorable (not to mention Mei). Miyazaki has refused to follow in the footsteps of other Japanese film-makers and do those awful anime movies that are, unfortunately, popular among many of my friends. Instead, he has made animated films that look and are captivating. I love how he did the fantasy element in this movie, with the totoros flying and doing magical wonders and Satsuki and Mei looking like they're having the time of their life. My favorite part is when Satsuki and Mei sneak outside to see the totoros and they make the trees grow (and their father has no clue!). The enchanting music during that part was what made it memorable. A must-see for all little kids.",

47,16 March 2007,zh84,10, The most charming film I have EVER seen!,"This film is intended for small children, so Miyazaki says. I was thirty-six when I watched it. I was so charmed that I showed it again to my father, who was then seventy-seven. He was so charmed that he insisted we must show it to his grandson, who is four. I have seen more exciting films, or funnier films, but none which gave me more sheer delight. It is a great shame the world isn't really as nice as this, but when you are four, like Mei, or even eleven, like Satsuki, this is how you want it to be: everyone bigger is kind and can be trusted completely, and everything always comes right in the end. Knowing a little boy of Mei's age I can vouch for her being highly realistic, from the obsessive looking through a hole in a bucket to the scowling and sulking! The most touching moment is when Catbus' destination board changes to ""MEI"", showing Satsuki that he knows exactly where her little sister is, and that he's going to take her straight there. My only criticisms, if you can call them that, are that the DVD doesn't contain the legendary sequel ""Mei and the Kittenbus"", in which Mei meets and goes for a ride with Catbus's little son, and that I can't ride in Catbus myself. As a cat lover and occasional bus user I feel I was born to do that, and it's a disgrace he's only imaginary!",
48,22 October 2010,monkeydisco89,10, My favorite animated feature,"Hayao Miyazaki is a genius. Most critics and moviegoers will second that notion. My Neighbor Totoro, one of his earlier features, is evidence of that claim. On several occasions when recommending this film to friends they have asked me, ""Well, what is the movie about?"" And, well, that is mostly hard to explain. There is no set plot, structure, nor is there much conflict; the film simply follows the lives of two little girls that meet the King of the Forest, Totoro. The film is from the perspective of a child, which, in my opinion, is the core of this film's brilliance. You can't help but watch the film without being imbued with a sense of jubilant wonder, joy, and warmth. This movie is older than I am, but still feels new and original. Everything from the music to the scenery to the dialogue is top-notch. I would recommend getting the 2005 English version with Dakota and Elle Fanning, Pat Carroll and Tim Daly, though both English dubbings are great.",
49,28 July 2018,jboothmillard,7, My Neighbour Totoro,"I had seen the image of one of the recognisable title creature from this Japanese anime movie several times, and I am obviously a big fan of the animations from Studio Ghibli, so I could not wait to watch it, directed by Hayao Miyazaki (The Castle of Cagliostro, Spirited Away, Ponyo). Basically set in 1958 Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe (Tim Daly) and his two daughters, Satsuki (Dakota Fanning) and Mei (Elle Fanning), have moved into an old house to be closer to the hospital where the girls' mother, Yasuko (Lea Salonga), is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited with by tiny creatures, small, dark, dust-like house spirits called susuwatari, until the girls and their father settle into the house, the soot spirits drift away on the wind to find another empty house. One day, Mei sees two white, rabbit-like ears in the grass, they are two spirits, they lead her through a briar patch and into the hollow of a large camphor tree. She meets and befriends a larger version of the same kind of spirit (Frank Welker), it identifies itself with a series of roars, which Mei interprets as ""Totoro"", she falls asleep atop the large creature. When Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground in a dense briar clearing, despite her attempts, Mei cannot show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her, telling her she must have encountered the ""keeper of the forest"", and that Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to. On a rainy night, the girls become worried when a bus they are expecting carrying Tatsuo does not arrive, Mei falls asleep, and Satsuki is able to see Totoro when he appears beside them, he is delighted to be offered an umbrella to shade him from the rain. In return, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds, then a giant bus-shaped cat appears, halting at the stop, Totoro boards it, taking the umbrella, they disappear, shortly after Tatsuo's bus arrives. The girls plant the seeds, a few days later Totoro and his miniature colleagues appears and engage in a ceremonial dance, when the girls join in, the seeds sprout, growing and combining into an enormous tree, then Totoro, his colleagues and the girls go for a ride on a magical flying top. In the morning, the tree is gone, but the seeds have indeed sprouted, it is unclear if they girls were dreaming or not. The girls find out that a planned visit to Yasuko has been postponed due to a setback in her treatment, Satsuki is disappointed and worried, while Mei is upset and angry, leading to an argument between the sisters. Mei disappears, prompting Satsuki and the neighbours to search for her, Mei is trying to walk the long distance to the hospital to bring her mother some fresh corn. In desperation, Satsuki returns to the camphor tree and pleads with Totoro to help her, he is delighted to assist, and summons the Catbus, which carries her to where Mei has stopped. Having rescued Mei, the Catbus then whisks her and Satsuki over the countryside to see Yasuko in the hospital, they perch in a tree outside, to overhear the conversation between their parents. They hear that their mother has a minor, but is otherwise fine, they secretly leave some corn on the windowsill, and return home in the Catbus. Eventually, Mei and Satsuki's mother returns home, the sisters play with each other, while Totoro and his friends watch the family from afar. Also starring The Little Mermaid's Pat Carroll as Granny, Paul Butcher as Kanta and The Simpsons' Russi Taylor as Additional Voices. This film has developed a cult following over the years, it is interesting insight into childhood innocence and experiences, it is a bit of minimal storyline, but you can enjoy the adventurous moments, furry Totoro is adorable, the 12-legged cat bus is wonderfully bizarre, and the colourful animation is of course delightful viewing, a worthwhile animated fantasy. Very good!",
50,16 October 2010,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8, There goes the neighbourhood,"When a man moves with his two young daughters(who are credible, with their child-like energy and their enthusiasm, that does give in to fear and doubt at times) to be closer to his hospitalized wife, the girls both begin seeing nature spirits. As they try to deal with their mother's illness, they experience amazing things with the imaginative creatures, including King Totoro, a large, fuzzy teddy-bear that smiles a lot and the many-legged Catbus. I suppose the main argument against this is the lack of real conflict(and without that, you don't really have a story), and the fact that the 10-year-old Satsuki(gesundheit) and the 4-year-old Mei can be rather obnoxious. Some will say that this doesn't need it; it's about the enchanting world(and it certainly is that). In addition to the magic, this does paint a convincing picture of the situation. This builds an atmosphere so effortlessly you barely believe it. The animation is smooth and ""feels"" real, including the setting of rural Japan, decades ago. There is a nice level of expression to the faces, especially the eyes. A cynic of many years, I will admit that this *did* win me over, yes, it is cute, the youngest of the 2 siblings is adorable(at times). There is some realistic kid dialog in this. The acting is great. If this does not tug at your heartstrings at least a bit, it may be time for a checkup. This is a truly well-done, sweet film that you can show children and they may love it, and it *isn't* pure garbage made with the sole intent being profit. There is nothing offensive in this. The DVD comes with a trailer for this, one for Kiki's Delivery Service and one for Howl's Moving Castle. I recommend this to any fan of fantasy. 8/10",

81,21 May 2006,Zoopansick,3, I dare your five-year old not to be bored,"This is supposedly one of the ""Great Movies"" according to Roger Ebert...My tone in the previous sentence should suffice for my review, but I feel like more needs to be said. My Neighbor Totoro isn't offensive, obnoxious, disturbing, annoying, or irritating in any way. And as Ebert continually points out in his review, it doesn't fall in line with a lot of clichés that are prevalent in American cartoons in terms of characterization or plot-line. This may all be true; but it doesn't make up for it's fatal flaw...it's boring. It's really really, boring. There is hardly any plot other then these 2 girls hanging around their house out in the country side. The title character makes his first appearance 30 minutes in, and only a couple of times after that. He doesn't do much either. In his debut scene he sleeps and yawns...how appropriate. Later he does some other stuff but it's not too exciting and perhaps only mildly so compared to the doldrum of the girls lives. I wasn't ""enchanted"", the world didn't seem that magical to me, and with the lack of any compelling plot I couldn't help but once again become baffled by the godly praise for this movie. The animation is OK but don't see why Miyazaki's work is considered to be THAT much better then everyone else's. Perhaps you have to be an anime aficionado to understand why. Perhaps you have to be an anime aficionado to love this movie. I can think of no other reason why. Granted, I'm 23 and cartoons don't hold the same appeal as they did 15 years ago. But that being said, I can't see myself even sitting through this 15 years ago. And as an adult, it doesn't seem to hold much value. There is no plot, the writing is forgettable, and I don't find it's artistic value to be any higher then that of any other anime. Bottom line, if you are an anime fan, you aren't even reading this because you own My Neighboro Totoro on DVD and are probably waiting for the special edition. However, if you are checking up on one of the ""Great Movies"" or if you a parent and want to show your kid something, I can't recommend it to you on either level.",

88,21 June 2008,Jens-ar,10, Subtle and poetic,"Two little girls, Satsuki and Mei, moves into an old house in the Japanese country with their father. Their sick mother is at the hospital. The two kids meet the gentle and flute playing Totoro, a hybrid between a gigantic rodent and a bear. The movie's style is quite different from most Western animations, and only a few Disney movies can hold their own to Tonari no Totoro's amazing and poetic expression. The bus stop scene is brilliant, and so are many other similar scenes where only few words are spoken. Disney animations are often too restless to create an atmosphere like this. Pardoxically the two children are a bit stereotypical at times, but in the end of the movie they become more complex. At this point in the film a cryptic message from the mother's hospital, makes the children suspect that their mother has died. After an intense drama they are being flown to the hospital in Totoro's bizarre cat bus. But it turns out that the mother has only had a cold and that she's going to comeback to them soon. This is, though a foundation for a happy ending, a bit of an anticlimax. I couldn't help but wonder if the movie would be better if the mother was dead from the start of the film. Not that I'm a sadist, but as it is, the children are living a great life in a beautiful place, and when their mother comes back, all is practically well, this would make it seem so perfect, that you don't feel like you have to pity the kids, which makes their attempt in finding comfort in their friendship with Totoro less touching than it could be. If the mother was dead, the movie would probably touch some deeper feelings. But this is only a thought. However, a psychological interpretation could be that the mother really is dying, and Totoro only is a delusion made by the children in their grief. But this would however be too cruel. Perhaps the perfectly happy ending is the best way to end the film, though a sad future awaits the children when they get too old to see Totoro. Though I'm not a big fan of the manga style I must admit that it's masterfully animated, and the imaginative pictures make the movie seem like a beautiful dream.",

This is probably the most over rated film from Miyazaki, the uber over rated Japanese anime director.Its all done in a pastel tone animated style that looks like an a painting by a first grader, yet some of the backgrounds do have a certain charm to them.There is no edge, conflict, sense of menace or real emotion or drama in this pablum coated film to engage the audience. Even a 3 year old would become bored-fast. Done by Studio Ghibli-a sort of Japanese Disney studio, this turkey has earned much yen since its release. Not to mention the merchandising it has inspired that, fortunately is not too readily available in the United States. And can anybody please tell me what is so great about Miyazaki? He's just another ""in it for the money"" artist like Tim Burton, Spielberg, and Murakami. As a matter of fact, I have a hard time distinguishing Miyazaki from Murakami.. Even Spielberg's ""ET"", a film that I thoroughly hated seems enjoyable and well made when compared to this. Do yourself a favor-watch it only if you have to.

If you could only go back to those beautiful times, when nothing mattered, wen you could play all day and run around the house...

I found myself smiling all the way through. The characters are all so lovable, I marvel at Hayao miyazaki's ability to create something truly imaginative out of every standard object. The film is visually beautiful and wondrous. What was also heart warming was the relationship between the father, mother and kiddies, it's everybody's ideal family unit. It reflected well the older sister younger sister relationship, leaving the viewer feeling very nostalgic. The cat embodied everything that a child desires from a companion. The film managed to capture the world that children live in and take you back to what it felt like to be a child living in your own idealist environment. Basically i feel it's impossible for anybody to watch this film and be left feeling cold. It warms you from your toes to the tip of your head, you'll be smiling for days.",

So today is the first time I actually saw this movie for the very first time. And my first thoughts: People actually like this? People actually prefer this over Disney classics? There is absolutely no way this soulless movie is even on par with ANY Disney classic. The plot is non-existent and events are totally random and laughably stupid. And the ending is so sugar coated it gave me cavities. A pity, because I was actaully really looking forward to this. Oh well... Back to The little Mermaid, Lion King and Alladin for me",

It's charming, with beautiful artwork, animation, and music. The pacing may be slow and most of the time barely anything happens, but it's still worth watching. A very simple film about two little girls meeting and befriending forest spirits while moving into a new home with their father, all while their mother is ill and in hospital. Most of the film focuses on them, Totoro and the other forest spirits being occasional highlights throughout the film. It's not action packed or exciting but it doesn't need to be. It's supposed to be a soothing, cute movie with themes of youth, friendship, and family. So, if that sounds appealing to you, I suggest giving it a try.",

While playing in the garden, Mei sees a strange furry character and takes after it. The events that follow lead her and Satsuki to a wondrous backyard adventure with magical creatures. Are they real? Imaginary? This film has a cuteness factor that runs off the scale.

When I looked up Miyazaki's filmogrophy I saw that he directed Totoro. I knew that I had to see it one way or another. About four weeks ago I bought the import DVD and I watched it again. I fell in love with it again. It's probably the cutest movie ever. The creature Totoro is the best ""cute-thing"" ever to hit the silver screen. Mei and Satsuki are brilliant. If you don't have time to see the whole movie then just watch the bus-stop scene. Brilliant! You can never go wrong with Miyazaki.

I started noticing the influence WW2 had on film makes like this and I think this movie captures it in a fun childish way that does not loose it power. The character design was amazing from the girls to all of the creatures. I think that Miyazaki can pull off taking a pretty empty shot and using to keep the pace of the movie without it being obvious, but then it picks up and it just turns into a whirlwind of magic. The tragic nature of a lot of Japanese film and the way of coping with it by creating a fantastical world where dreams literally come true. I think one of the nice things at the end of the movie that no one including the parents and the audience don't believe in the magic that propels the movie. At times it is a little scary, but in a good way, but nothing horrible every really happens. The only reason this movie does not get a 10 is because when watching any Miyazaki film one inevitably compares it to his other films and I do not think this top spirited away, but has a place in every movie library.",

I have been seeing the movie many times without getting bored while I become tired of seeing other movies easily right at the second or third time. I can't imagine how the director can create such real and cute characters. Notice the way Mei goes upstairs and downstairs, showing Myazaki to be very observant about children's actions. They are amazing compared to conventional move of Waldisney's as well as of many other animated movies. The movie is a simple story with normal circumstances of daily life, about a family with 4 members, the father is a university professor, the mother is in hospital because of suffering from a disease unknown and the two children of 10 and 4 years old are still very innocent. The family is as ordinary as most of real families around us but described within several selective days. That is when they move to a new house in the beautiful countryside. The fresh scene encourages the two children to discover everything they see and this leads them to meeting with Totoro. Totoro is only a character of imagination but more real than any other imagined characters. He looks like a bear and may symbol children's belief in good things of life. One of the scenes i like best is that of the three people bathing together when a very serious storm goes through the area, shaking the house and scaring the two children, so warm. And the scenes of field, hills remind me of my childhood as if it was just yesterday. For me this is Myazaki's best animated movie and one of the best animations of all time. Voted it 10 stars.",

The ones I'd watched - PRINCESS MONONOKE (1997), SPIRITED AWAY (2001; his best, in my opinion) and HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (2004) - were all plot-packed, overwhelming visual experiences, so I was surprised to find this one much simpler, virtually kiddie-oriented and essentially plot less! It was still meticulously detailed and inventive, with two extremely likable female protagonists and equally delightful anthropomorphic characters - not to mention an infectious title track. I've yet to catch up with quite a number of his films (TCM showed a retrospective of his work while I was in Hollywood late last year, but I didn't have the time - or stamina - for them) but, given their basic similarity, I guess it's best to approach them one at a time (my local DVD rental outlet does carry a few more titles, though)...",

Some of the trademark Miyazaki visually arresting elements are there - particularly the fantastic catbus. His mastery of artistic representations of natural elements (rainstorms, waves, etc.) which made ""Spirited Away"" and ""Ponyo"" such true works of art are here only in a pale reflection. ""Tonari No Totoro"" also does not delve into epic storytelling of war and environmental collapse as the later works do but does tell an mildly uplifting child's story of coping with sickness and displacement using the power of imagination.

Sadly, and for all its plaudits, the film comes off as ultimately a bit of an inconsequence - it isn't exciting, nor particularly memorable: there is little conflict; little drama and the film is extraordinarily light on narrative and character. If I told you the film was about a child encountering monsters given these things, you might raise an eyebrow. However, if I told you the monsters, instead of being scary, were themselves scared of an energetic, boisterous human presence then you might be able to put two-and-two together in that the animation is less interested in delivering the generic thrills and spills that come with such a premise and more interested in exploration and revisionism. That's fine, of course; but when the charm of such an idea has worn off and the approach to have it both ways in its grounded depiction of a dramatic reality (alá Ocean Waves or Only Yesterday) mixed with fruiter, more escapist Ghibli fare driven by encounters with odd animals, we are not left with much in which to get interested nor with which to stay invested.",

The characters are memorable, the music brings out some emotion and the story was nice and simple and is not like the many kids films were it needs to have a hero, a villain etc. it's just a story of two little girls who have an imagination of a bear character known as Totoro. As kids films do have a message, like most of the director's great work, it's hard to underly what the message is of the film, most idiots may 'think' that Totoro is the symbol of death, when really he isn't as the mother in the hospital was OK, look at the end credits, and that the shoe that was found in the pond was not Mei's at all.

We can see Japan's typical countryside and an ordinary life whenever we see the film, we feel peaceful. For even those who live in a big city, the movie might have relaxation effects? Second its music and pictures are very enchanting. Maybe almost all the Japanese know ""Sanpo"" -Totoro's theme song- the song is very very famous. It always makes us happy.The pictures are also popular. All characters have tender facial expression. I love their smiles. Everyone like them, don't they? Third, There are many silent without conversation. In such a scene, I can hear the song of birds, sounds of wind. I feel comfortable and calm .It is really Miyazaki's world. This movie will give you gentle, comfortable and calm mind. I can recommend this movie to everyone. Particularly I want to recommend this movie to those who are busy everyday. Maybe this movie makes such people smile.",

And Totoro was the 2nd one of his movies I'd seen, and after seeing most if not all of his movies, this one remains my favorite. It captures childhood innocence and countryside playing immaculately while introducing one of the most recognizable and iconic cartoon characters ever to come from Japan. Totoro is pure enjoyment and fun. From the music to the animation and the beloved Totoro and Neko-Bus, this movie shines and charms. There are so many wonderful scenes and most people will rightfully point to the bus-stop scene as the centerpiece scene - it's my favorite in the movie too no doubt; to add to that I liked the simple countryside story, the settings, background, the noises and sounds and the life depicted. The Japanese voice actors do a fine job as usual too. Totoro is a true classic of animation - as good or better as any Disney or other animation ever crafted, and most likely will remain my particular favorite. Simple, playful, and warm, Totoro will charm like few movies can. Tops - Highly recommended.",

164,22 September 2015,sharky_55,10, Simply enchanting,"The original Japanese audio is imperative to My Neighbour Totoro and I highly recommended it. Not that the English dub isn't sufficient (Ghibli films tend to attract a certain amount of care), but it doesn't do justice the lovely representation of childhood and innocence that the master Miyazaki conjures here. The sisters Satsuki and Mei discover these dust bunnies, little black fluffballs with tiny legs and eyes (this design later revisited in Spirited Away), and they may exist or not, but the adults in their father and Granny certainly indulge them. They delight in this discovery of their 'haunted' house and scream out shrilly and cackle for the bunnies in a way that only the original Japanese can fully justify. And in the animation their eyes grow wide and their grins grow massive - even more massive than say, the arguing men in Castle in the Sky, and that is truly a mark of great emotion when considering Miyazaki's work. That is again revisited in the bathing scene amidst a harrowing storm, where the father ushers in this silliness and over the top laughter to scare away the evil spirits. He's a thoughtful and caring and accommodating character like so few fathers in fiction are today - he isn't the problem, but his career and absence merely a symptom of life. Hisaishi's lovely track ""Obake Yashiki"" (or Haunted House) aids this discovery process; the eager plucks of the synthesizer create such a nervous excitement and curiosity that Satsuki and Mei clutch with their hands and eagerly embrace. I am reminded of this same track being used in this Chinese cartoon from my childhood, about a similarly gigantic tree amongst small trees in peaceful serene forest, until loggers arrive. ",

It's an adorable children's film with a lot of heart and soul, it's the first film people conjure up when they think of Studio Ghibli, and it's one of the most recognizable Japanese animated films of all time. Out of all the films by Hayao Miyazaki, this one just might be his most popular, even more than his greatest accomplishments like that of Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke.

170,5 June 2007,GSmith9072,10, There should be more films like this,"So simple, so poetic. Two young girls move to the country and discover to helpful furry friends. ""My Neighbor Tortoro"" is a celebration of childhood and imagination and the film is executed brilliantly. The plot is the least of the film's worries. It just goes with the flow, and yet it's fully allowed to. The major conflict in the film doesn't arrive until past the middle, but its odd narrative is more of its subtle beauty. Without to much apparent conflict, we're invited to watch the flashes of fish in the river and uncover odd critters that live in the attic. And so, the magic in the film subtly blends with childhood discovery. There's tadpoles in a puddle, and cute little critters that disappear when chased. There's a big critter with an inviting stomach. The hand painted fluid and organic animation is beyond gorgeous and very appropriate for the earthy flair to this film. Speaking of earth, I find films like these to be the best advocates of environmental protection. We're not padded over the head with anything, but the image of a bottle in a clear lake leaves a strong impact to all viewers. That of course is just another side theme in the film, the importance of nature, and more importantly, it's a non-objectable message. It breaths for me like a painting, and yet the atmosphere is so relaxing and engaging. I don't hesitate to accept the world the little girls create/experience. The messages are those that everyone can relate to. I never grew up Japan (or found any magical creatures that I can remember), but I could certainly identify with the film's two main characters. And if you didn't have a great childhood, sit back and enjoy the adventures of the two eager little girls in this wonderful little film that's also a landmark in animation.",

Everything seems normal at first until one day mei see small creatures walking pass her like she won't notice it. After following them she comes across a creature known as Totoro a dragon cat spirit of some sort.over the course of the movie Satsuki and mei meet up with Totoro and go on adventures and play games with one another. The Choice of scenery was a good decision to be made taken place or out in the country country side as opposed to the city where it's less distractions. The story keeps the focus on the girls and both are a silly and over the top happy. It's also nice where usually the mother is in a supporting role for the kids instead it's the father who at no point belittles their imagination even though it is real he just goes along and sarcastically agrees with them that ah yes there are spirits their all around us"" Or ""of course dear I believe you totoro is real"". He supports the girls in this time of need with what's going on with her mother. The biggest pro with some cons of the movie is none other then Totoro himself. I'm not disrespecting or Belittling Totoro and what he has to offer to the film it goes without saying how popular this character is given that he's the official mascot of the studio. Totoro does serve his purpose in keeping the girls happy and coping with their mothers condition he takes them for rides & flying. I personally felt that there wasn't enough scenes of them interacting when you get down to it apart from the Occasional shenanigans Totoro doesn't do much for lots of the time but sleep.

My Neighbour Totoro is another enchanting film about 2 girls making friends with the forest spirits and having various adventures. MNT is widely regarded as one of the best animated movies ever and it should be. It's not as good as the other Ghibli films I've seen. It's very short and there's not that much of a plot. Therefore, it feels slighter and briefer than the others. There is a slight lack of structure. Those shortcomings demote it from a five star movie to a four star one, but there's plenty to love about this movie. The visuals are great and there is a real sense of wonder and amazement.

I liked how the kids ran excitedly through their new house together exploring all the rooms & also meeting their neighbors. The big sister is always there for her little sister. It's interesting seeing how the Japanese live & the style of their kitchens, bathrooms, & bedrooms differ from American houses. The parts I didn't like so much was when Totoro makes his appearances. The 1st time the little girl runs into Totoro while she's playing outside by herself while her older sister is at school. Totoro is borrring. He's a very dull character. She runs into him while he's asleep in his cave. He did nothing but sleep, snore, & say his name in some kind of horrible growling screaming way while opening his huge mouth & baring his teeth. You can barely recognize that he's saying ""Totoro"". It was freaky. The next time Totoro makes an appearance is when the two girls are waiting in the rain by themselves at a bus stop for their father's bus to come bringing him home from work. The little girl is tired & cannot stay awake anymore. There's no bench & the ground is wet so the older sister has to carry her. Totoro didn't do anything- just walks up & stands next to her at the bus stop. He just stands there silent. The older girl stares at him wide eyed & gives him an umbrella. Instead of something cute happening Totoro decides to use his magic to shake the rain drops down on top of them from leaves of the tall trees. Besides the normal rain, now they have to endure bigger drops pelting down on them really hard from the trees & they make a very loud sound as they hit their umbrellas. It seemed like a mean scary thing to do. Totoro should of tried to make the girls feel more comfortable while they're outside alone in the rain waiting for their father. The girls are worried because his bus is late. The little girl is so tired she can't stand up anymore. There's no bench to sit on while they wait for their father so the big sister had to carry her & an umbrella. Totoro shows up & you would think he would do something to make her feel at ease. Instead he makes it rain harder. Then an odd bus shows up in the shape of a cat & Totoro gets on it & without saying a word the cat bus takes off & the two girls are all alone again. Stupid.

Totoro reminds us what it feels to see the world around us as a child, where everything is new, fresh, and exciting.  This movie also contains some of the best scenes ever created in an Anime.  There is a lot of HEART in this movie.  It is also clear that rather than designing the visuals for the sake of merely making them look pretty/ appealing, the designers uses their sensitivity to convey how interesting the world looks from their point of view.  This results in a movie that connects to the audience in so many ways.  This movie certainly has the charm and ""magic"" that had been lost in so many recent animated features. I highly recommend this movie.",

228,22 February 2021,miaalike,10," Masterpiece about nature, childhood and feelings","The movie is not just for children. All of us, if at least a bit fortunate to have had a childhood free of superimposed adult perspective, can relate to it. The images and events from the movie are like seen through the eyes of a child. A moderately happy child, not the utopil ultimately carefree one, nor the unhappy one that is dragged into adult problems in a way that ruins childhood. Two sisters take up a summer residence in the countryside with their father, to be closer to their mother who is temporarily in hospital. That is the framework story. On this framework we get to experience beautiful moments in the time spent close to nature, especially by the main character, the big sister. These moments cross into a magical realm, as it often happens with children. The story is like a suite of small poems, haikus if you like to call them so. Once you resonate with the movie, these poems will stay with you forever. The music is also great, matches the atmosphere. And there is that feeling that when watching this movie, you remember dreamily bits and bobs from your own early childhood, otherwise lost under layers and layers of adulthood. Because the movie captures the feel of those moments. No idea how children perceive the movie, however it is family friendly and might provide a watercoloury, nice, story for any child, along with an important message that nature is a warm, kind and spirit-filled entity that loves us all and expects the same from us.",

I hadn't seen it before (the anime-freaks looked doubtfully at me) and as it is a Studio Ghibli piece, I had quite a good feeling about that this was going to be a good one (as the vast majority of Ghibli's works are so neat). I must say that the story was sweet, and there is some kind of magic woven in here, enhancing the movie in some way, putting a smile on your lips for sure. I can't really point out anything specific that I got really hooked on, but there were something with the atmosphere I believe. A solid 7/10 well worth seeing for the whole family.

The main characters are two of the most believable kids I know of in cinema, and we see the world through their eyes: not only the magical worlds of imagination and nature, but also the presence of death and the fragility of happiness.  Don't get me wrong -- it's a very, very happy movie -- but in spite of the wildly imaginative fantasy element, it's a believable happiness because of the other things it acknowledges.

They performed the notorious Disney cutting of the film they're famous for when given foreign animated films. Eliminating scenes all throughout the movie, or just cutting scenes shorter. All the voices were redone horribly. The two young girls who were tasked to re-perform the voices of the two main characters sucked. Every change was pointless and brought the movie down.

You must also not get easily annoyed by little girls with high voices. Of course you are open to Japanese customs (or else you wouldn't be reading about this Japanese movie). I think the main character Totoro looks cool by just doing nothing (don't worry, he'll do more).

Third,both children and adults can enjoy it because the theme of the story is clear. I think,Tonari no Totoro's theme is ""importance of Family and nature."" I love the scene Mei goes to deliver corn for mother,and I also like the one. Satsuki cries because she worries about her mother. They are all heart warming. And the village Kusakabe family moves in surrounded by wonderful nature. Totoro and Nekobus show us the importance of nature. The movie has a lot of important things.",

Having re-watched it recently, I found myself wishing it had gone on longer and was still totally captivated by the magic that is Totoro. It plays perfectly to your imagination and delights you to no end. It is 25 years old though, so don't expect the dubbing to be perfect.

One was ""Grave of the Fireflies"", Isao Takahata's undeniable masterpiece. The other one is this, Hayao Miyazaki's final break through as an internationally known director, ""My Neighbour Totoro"" (Tonari no Totoro, 1988). Although the difference between the two films is like a day and night, they have both earned their places amongst great animations. If ""Grave of the Fireflies"" made you cry, ""Totoro"" will quickly put a smile back to your face.",
284,8 July 2020,monsterhunt-94296,7, Wonderful,"Alright so a few days ago I watched My Neighbor Totoro, my second film from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. I have to say, Miyazaki is a very talented filmmaker and knows how to make an animation. There is one specific aspect of both Totoro and Spirited Away that I want to touch on, I don't know if it continues in his other films, but it is present in both of these. Both of these films served as a reminder for something. Spirited Away reminded me why I watched movies with its blooming creativity and intriguing characters, and My Neighbor Totoro reminded me what it's like to be a small, energetic, and overjoyed child. The movie's plot is quite simple and short, only clocking in at about an hour and a half, but in that time you get one last taste of that childish wonder and excitement you used to feel daily. The characters are very well done and once again I watched the subbed version, and the voice acting here worked well. The voices fit the characters and sounded like they were bursting with excitement when they were excited, and bursting with sadness when they were sad. The animation is wonderful, and it also expresses that childish feeling with the way the characters move. The movie is very entertaining and works for all ages, whether you're a 8 year old kid or a 38 year old man. The movie is also unique in that there's no antagonistic force at play, just more of a ""slice-of-life"" type movie. If you're wondering what the movie is about, I think it's best for me to not even explain. If what I've described sounds interesting, check it out, if not, you can pass. Overall this movie was a nice feel-good experience that makes you smile while watching it, and while I don't think it's a masterpiece, I'd definitely recommend it. My Neighbor Totoro gets a 7.5/10.",

305,6 December 2002,steffanmb,10, Beautiful film for film-lovers or children,"This is a great film either for adults or adults looking for a great film for their kids to watch. Unlike other Miyazake films, Totoro is set in contemporary rural Japan, and aims at a younger audience. Like his other films, it is beautifully animated and scored, with an engaging and moving story line. It also centres on a strong girl heroine and a fantasy world. It also has the tightest plot structure of Miyazake's movies, which is to say, it lacks the complexity of his more adult-orientated works. Aside from the wonderful characters and sensitive story-line, it is a great glimpse into Japanese rural life, from roadside shrines to family bathing. It also beats Disney movies hands down for depth of characterization, mood and general quirkiness. And unlike Disney movies, it has a story, rather than a formula. The premise concerns a father and his two daughters who move into an old house while the mother convalesces in a nearby hospital. The story explores the emotions aroused by this move, adjustment to rural life and the mother's illness in an understated way. However, the real fun is the magical parallel world that the girls discover in their backyard.",

Minor inconveniences that happen in life such as dropping something or stuttering is all very well executed in this movie, normally the reality of a simple life and gets quite overwhelmed by the actual storyline, in this movie we got a good representation of a normal life with a magical twist. The characters are very well-made and get as much screen time as they deserve and need. In the beginning we don't know much about Totoro but as the movie continues we learn more about him and about his acts. I love how simple objects such as the umbrella or nut thingie were used by the characters and actually got meaning in this movie. The cinematography in these types of movies is normally not at its best, because it's hard to create a very pretty scene when you have to draw everything. But with basically all Studio Ghibli movies I loved the cinematography, the scene where Totora, Satsuki and Mei are waiting for the bus and we have this perfectly aligned and symmetrical shot with the bus stop sign, the two girls, and Totoro is just really pretty to look at.",

311,23 January 2002,Puppetmister,10, A miracle - and worth making babies for...,"Totoro joins a very small group of children's films which leave no nagging doubts that they might be bad for your kids to view repeatedly.  Disney features constantly equate physical deformity with evil; Power Rangers teach that ugly people are evil AND need a good kicking; Pokemon considers that your kids have no attention span and need to be electro-shocked with constant stroboscopic, primary-coloured violence.  Totoro preserves a magical simplicity which allows both the wonderment of child-like innocence and imaginary friends, and the doting of parents touched by such carefree marvelling.  Everything in this film can be viewed through the eyes of the children or their parents, and such thematised appreciation of multiple audiences makes Disney's formula of anthropomorphised cuddly things throwing occasionally suggestive remarks at the older viewer seem cynically contrived.  The Disney approach divides the audience in young and old, sneaking mild innuendo over the kids' heads and allowing the adults a sneaky smirk every now and then - Totoro is a joint viewing experience for parent and child, and has a message for both.  I'm glad its been so well received in America and in the few places it has been seen in the UK.  I was worried at first that it might be too slow for some children, and Totoro's appearances are few and fleeting.  This is amongst the finest family films ever made, and I want to make babies just so they can see it.  A little help, anyone?",

Most family films don't do that to me as an adult (mostly films I never grew up with such as this.) The dubbing isn't all that bad but it's not spectacular ether. What's important is how well the premise and the characters and the moral (I don't think this even has a moral but it doesn't need one, in my opinion. It can be just a whimsical imaginative fantasy like Alice in Wonderland) is written and it's all written very well.

Comparing to Disney movies, the story is very deep and mature. Characters are drawn in Japanese style, rather kawaii, which might annoy some.

For whatever reason, they took it upon themselves to ""improve"" or update the film. They changed many of the voices and also changed some names and also the dialogue, all in bad ways. Did they not learn anything from the reaction to The Last Airbender? The result is a darker and less pleasing version than the original.

It is without doubt one of the greatest animated films of all time. I have always wanted to see a Hayao Miyazaki film as he has been frequently described as the greatest animator of all time. I have to watch a lot of his movies and also other animated films to figure that out. This film was a beautiful, gorgeous and marvelous ride. The story is really interesting as it contains well defined characters and a great setting. Needless to say, the animation in the film is masterful as you would expect from any Studio Ghibli film. The story does not contain any antagonist or bad guy, and I think it is one of the best idea to follow on that. You are always thinking that something is going to bad but it always comes back to the joyful ambience which the film wants to focus on the most. The animation is like a moving painting with focus on the characters. The soundtrack is well made and fits the movie easily. The only problem had with the movie was that Totoro could have been explored and developed more. I loved his character and I would have loved to see more of him in the film. I still prefer Grave of the fireflies as I felt more emotionally wise when I watched that, but My Neighbour Totoro is slightly better made out of the two.",

Like he is much better than those little spoiled creatures ILLUMINATION makes. This is just a big guy you can hug all day. These Miyazaki movies all have beautiful animation and scores. This one is the best. This movie is just so peaceful and needs an audience that is really clever. If you are just this MCU fan that wants to check out this movie because it has so much praise and is on Netflix no, you will not like this movie AS much.

When i watched it a tear-drop came out from my eyes. The love and care this movies showed made me cry. It shows us the way human being should live their lives. After watching this movie, i started to realize that I should live my life helping others and keep people around me happy. What a magical movie this is.

341,25 September 2000,redneck-6,10," Lighthearted, but intelligent look at the world through childrens' eyes.","Classifying this as mere anime and thinking that fans of anime are the only people who might enjoy this film doesn't really do it justice at all.  It's a beautifully simple tale that intelligently mixes lighthearted whimsy with serious subject matter, managing to entertain without being trite or patronizing to adults or children. Two girls move with their father to the countryside to be near the hospital where their mother is recovering from a serious illness.  They meet and befriend magical creatures living under a giant tree on the hill next to their home, the Totoros, who in subtle and gentle ways help the girls deal with the worry and confusion of being separated from their mother.  Adults will see a tale about what it's like to be a child in a world that can be sometimes wondrous and sometimes mean, and children will love the girls' adventures with the adorable Totoros.  The Totoros themselves come in different sizes and look somewhat like a cross between a cat, a bear, and a rabbit.  They are charged with keeping the natural world in order and perform duties such as making the wind blow and seeds sprout from the ground. The film is not afraid to take a slow serene pace and concentrate on seemingly unimportant background details such as trees, clouds, and streams. The rural surroundings that the story takes place in (Japan in the 1950's) are so lovingly rendered and intricately detailed that I found myself wishing I could visit and stay for a while. As a parent, I couldn't find anything in the film remotely unsuitable for children.  The world the girls inhabit, while at times sad, is filled with friends and caring adults who actually cherish the childrens' innocence. And while not only being entertaining for children, its gentle treatment of its mature subject matter may very well wind up serving as a starting point for discussion of coping with sadness or other negative emotions.  I believe anyone who can remember what it was like to be a child will find something to enjoy here, and I look forward very much to seeing more of Mr. Miyazaki's work.",

I was smiling almost the entire time, wanting to be a kid again. Everyone should see this and remember just what being a kid is all about. It's great how Mei is afraid of Nanny at the beginning, but by the end treats her like her own grandma. Totoro is too cute. While not the centerpiece of the film, he sure does add a great touch to the film. I think this and Spirited Away are Miyazaki's best films, followed closely by Princess Mononoke. This is just such a gem of a movie. So many details make this movie even greater. I know everyone remembers running around in the beginning of the film like Satsuki, making the ""Indian noises.""

Whenever I see this movie,I can identify myself with Mei.This is because maybe I looked like her when I was of her age.The after reasons I can identify myself with her is that I have an older sister and I'm as curious as Mei.Various characters appear in this movie and I believe you surely can identify yourself with one of them.",

But yeah, almost all of this movie is great, it touches those goos feels, the vistas are gorgeous, but there is almost no plot to be found. The story is small, really really small, which has beauty in itself, I was just longing for just that bit more. That's why I think a 7 is more than deserved!",

The fact that they portray a believable family view through the eyes of little Mei. The story is quite simple not clichéd it falls into a visual narrative with great views with an amazing level of detail counting this film is 20 years it remains ageless and is greatly enjoyable. Miyasaki is not the Disney of Japan he is in a league of his own. A must see for the family particularly if you dislike the princess stereotypes. The music is quite catchy too.,

369,25 January 2006,blacklaetherglove,9," cute, but not just for kids","After years of the Totoro plushies, I had a feeling this would be ultra-cutesy, Disnified, singsong fluff. It's not. It starts out with 2 little girls, aged about 9 & 4, moving into their new house. The house is pretty run down, and it's my guess that the family moved there either to be closer to the hospital where the mother was, or to help pay for the mother's medical bills. After seeing some ""dust bunnies"", which later appear in Miazaki's ""Spirited Away"", the youngest girl goes exploring & finds a tunnel into another, magical world. When she falls asleep on Totoro, who is like a big cat tolerating a child pulling its tail, she wakes up in the tunnel, and when she tries to find her way back, the tunnel just goes back outside again. About 20& of the movie is like this, the girls discovering magic things that disappear. For being young, they have a lot to deal with. In one scene,, they wait all day & night in the rain for their dad to come. Totoro appears, and adorableness ensues. At the end, in the credits, the animators hint that the mother comes home & possibly has another baby. It's a good end to a good story, but one that might be missed if you leave early :P",

Firstly, the characters are a delight. The girls are loud and annoying but at the same time so cute you love them. Totoro and every other fantasy being are wonderful and creative. The story itself, minus the fantasy element, is almost inconsequential but is enough to keep you engaged. The animation is incredible. Every scene a piece of art itself.

373,19 March 2007,mikvance,5, Irritatingly Sugary-Sweet,"There's no doubt that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius, but even Spielberg has made some clunkers in his time. My Neighbor Totoro is a beautiful animated tale with plenty of interesting character animation and breathtaking backgrounds. However, it takes exactly 30 minutes before the a ""totoro"" (the titular fictional creature) actually appears and then another 30 minutes before it does anything worthwhile. In between nothing happening, the characters are irritating sugary-sweet. The dialogue is so unoffensive that I was offended. Miyazaki-san is known for being a nature lover and usually animates cautionary tales about disrespect for nature. Sometimes this message is subtle; the rest of the time he wallops the audience over the head with it. This film is not even suitable for children as it slugs along with no pulse. On those rare occasions when a Totoro does appear, the creature's on screen interaction with the children is quirky and creative. When the creature is not on screen the humans trade sugary-sweet pleasantries back and forth ad nauseam. The girls are hyperactive but never once disciplined by their kind, but dull father. The sisters never once bicker and I must question why Miyazaki must have their panties showing whenever they run fast. The human characters once sat around and yapped about sharing fresh vegetables with one another. Why waste dialogue on how good a cucumber tastes? Where's the plot? There's no conflict or even a lesson to be learned. If you can stomach the overly-sweet dialogue and lack of a conflict for a full hour, you just may survive the last half-hour when something finally does happen. The last half-hour does not redeem the movie, instead its what should have been the movie all along!",

377,6 June 2018,Neradea33,10, Fascinating ...,"Tonari no Totoro is an animated film which tells the story of Satsuki, Mei and their father Tatsuo who just moved into a new place, a little house in the Japanese countryside, so that the girls are closer to their mother's hospital. The little house is surrounded by fields and forest. In the nearest forest, Mei and Satsuki are going to create strong ties with the forest spirits called Totoro. The forest spirit is really powerful in the way that, in a certain angle, he can represent the hope of the two young girls toward their mother's health and the wish that it gets better. What is interesting in this movie, is that it is different from the classic outline when the lead character has to fight/ win over an enemy which is another character. There is no enemy in this story, the main problem that hooks viewers is the disease. In this way Tonari no Totoro is different from most of animated movies putting forward the enemy and his/her fall as a goal. Moreover, the magical atmosphere of the movie, halfway between the real and the imaginary, plunges the viewers in a particular mood and way of thinking and incents them to feel more concerned about the problem while still not being too worried. Indeed, the movie is far from being a tragedy and the magical atmosphere debunks the stress of the disease in a way. From its deep content to the way it is structure, Tonari no Totoro is a really beautiful movie that I would definitely recommend watching!",

Earning an IMDb score of 8.2 (As you may literally know =P) i think this film is astonishing and deserves an 8.2 because Totoro's belly is fun and the Cat Bus is one charming character, it seems a lot better than the Secret of NIMH (1982) and many other Bluth Films, i hope Lasseter and even Miyazaki will understand!

Totoro is no exception, and is wonderful to watch when you don't feel like watching a movie with car chases, or transforming robots or bond villains or whatever. It's just a really relaxing film to watch and can really calm you down. Despite lacking in plot, it gains its story from everyday situations, and leaves you feeling satisfied at the end. A great thing for me was how much it reminded me of my own childhood, how you would wander off and get lost, exploring and the excitement of moving into a new house.

Supposedly, this film is his response to their outrage.  This is the kiddy film to beat all kiddy films.  There is no villain in this film.  None.  In spite of that, the story does not suffer at all.  I personally found the story to be quite charming, very entertaining and totally unique.

As simple as Totoro's story is, it strikes all the right chords, triggering tender emotions that we needn't ignore as we grow older and more cynical.  As I'm sure you've already read in the countless reviews, Totoro tells the story of two country children coming across magical creatures called totoro.  As always, the animation is gorgeous, beautifully fluid and expressive and (unlike many American animated films) not over-animated.  Although Totoro may lack in slam-bang action, I recommend it to anybody who is a fan of other Miyazaki films, animation in general, or an innocent, beautiful story that reminds us that we still possess that innocence.",
398,20 January 2013,Thisguy622,7, Cute,"This film is pretty much one of Hayao Miyazaki's most original pieces of work as it is so genuinely magical. Not being a child, I'm not sure if children would like this film as it can be slow paced. However I enjoyed the film because it was such a great avenue for imagination that it almost felt like I was in the shoes of the two little girls and discovering the things about the place they live in. This is a great film to reflect upon after watching, however not so great whilst watching it. As mentioned before it was almost boring at the start, but then the characters are introduced to a brilliant mythical world that ensures entertainment. A thing that was surprising about this film was how emotionally connected I felt to the characters and the situation with their ill mother, this ability to find an emotional link is what makes Studio Ghibl films so enjoyable and unique. And above all this movie is very cute in almost all aspects.",
399,29 April 2006,rbnadel,10, Is there an English language DVD of the ORIGINAL Fox dubbing ?,"My kids are disappointed with the new Disney dubbing because the voices have changed. Would love to know if anyone is aware of a DVD version of the original 1988 FOX (USA) release. I have searched and found a Japanese language DVD release which is fine, although we don't comprehend Japanese ! The original FOX version is truly wonderful. My kids have watched this version over and over for the past 8 years. Totoro is a wonderful story and we wish there was a trilogy or series of Totoro movies. Alas, the director and creator have other works which are excellent, but, they are NOT Totoro. Many thanks for any direction on finding the original DVD version.",

I picked this one and oh man it was great. I really couldn't believe how much I still enjoy these kinds of children animated fantasy cute spirits movies. This movie really created the most likeable creature of all time. I still wanted to hug that guy so badly just like I was when I was a kid. Other than that, I think the whole movie structured really really well. It never gets too over the top with the fantasies, and it knows exactly when to bring out the serious stuff and get emotional. It is all really well balanced. It also created really likeable characters as there are literally no evil characters throughout the film. Even though this movie sounds really childish, but I can tell you that's absolutely false. I watched it with my family and everyone liked it! This movie is really pure and heart warming and I think everyone will probably like this film. This is sure to be a timeless animated classic that I think everyone should watch. 10 out of 10 for me.",

406,1 November 2009,sampit,9, You will be smiling for days......,"Today I saw this fun filled masterpiece by Miyazaki.... the first half of the film breezes through and is thoroughly entertaining. The characters of Satsuki & Mei are brilliant to say the least, especially Mei's, who's a treat to watch. The movie says the story of two little sisters who shift to a new place with their father and the whimsical adventures that happen in that short stay of theirs.It tells us that the uncertainties of life offer us all the interesting escapades it needs. I had apprehensions before seeing the dubbed version. But the English dub blew me away. I have yet to come across a better dub than this. The voice overs and accents were brilliant. The movie is simple, entertaining and you cant help but smile throughout while watching this bizarre yet enchanting drama unfold before your very eyes. The main character of this movie was Totoro who's very cute and kind and stays in a big tree. I would have loved to see more of him though. In the little span of 80 minutes we go across so many emotions and yet when the movie is done you can recollect each and everyone of them. If this movie doesn't warm you nothing ever will. This movie demands a repeated viewing, and I will give it one in days to come. Till then I will wait for my Totoro.",
407,2 March 2019,b-20302,10, Great movie,"My neighbor Totoro is one of the best movies among Hayao Miyazaki's film. I watched it for the first time when I was 10 years old back in elementary school days.
This movie is about family and love. The family faces many difficulties throughout the film and overcome them together. Totoro plays an important role in the process.
Not only the picture, but also the acting of the voice actors is awesome. Their acting is awesome. I think this is because the director wrote a great screenplay, which showed how the acting should be in the film.
Also this movie has great ups and downs, which keep the audience's attention. Overall, I strongly recommend that you see this movie.",

Second,this movie is so fantastic that it has magical power.Certainly many people believe that Totoro really exists.This story make us recognize the importance of pure heart. I also like its music.Heart-warming music fits the movie's warm atmosphere.So I can be relaxed by this movie.

I'm capable of temporarily adjusting the age of my mind, to enjoy the more simple films, and view them as they were meant to be seen, and understood. That being said, i won't be judging this film and nitpicking the smallest of problems in the view because those problems are irrelevant considering this is a cartoon written, and made for children.",

415,26 June 2006,rie-hawaii,9, love the Miyazaki Hayao's movie,"I love this movie because it is really heart-warming. But it's content is not so simple as it seem to be. Even though I have watched this movie so many times,I'm sure that Iwill find something new in it every time I see it. In particular,I can find new meaning in the silent scenes of the Japanese version. When I saw the English version of Tonari no Totoro,I thought it contained too many detailed verbalized explanations,which make the movie more understandable to foreigners but also make it less attractive to those who are familiar with the Japanese culture. I believe many silent scenes in the Japanese version are really amazing,I can recommend this movie to anyone who loves movie.",
416,25 September 2021,HuntersFilmReviews,9, A wonderful Miyazaki film.,"A beautiful story about childhood, friendship, wonder, and magic. What Studio Ghibili did here was craft one of the most memorable and distinct animated films of all time. Totoro is absolutely iconic and provides a fun and happy watch. This may be a ""childrens"" movie, but I would recommend this to anybody wether they are 80 years old or 18 years old, because this truly is a film for everybody.",
417,29 April 2003,orgg,10, Always makes me feel better about life.,One of my all time favorite movies. There is something about it that just makes me feel better about life. The fact that the father in the movie is always cheerful and in a good mood for his children even though their mother is sick in the hospital and the fact that big Totoro and his little Totoros are simply amazing creatures are two of things about the movie that bring a smile to my face. I try to watch this movie at least once every couple of months and the great thing is that it is suitable for all ages. If you have not seen this movie I recommend checking it out (along with all the other Miyazaki movies as well).,
418,5 September 2018,Marsha2020,7, Sweet,"It reminded me in part of Alice in Wonderland (""follow the white rabbit"") and in part of Mary Poppins (the Totoro - umbrella scene). Overall it is a sweet picture about childhood, but at the same time it's realistic and deals with adult issues (family relationships, illness).",
419,27 March 2001,talic,9, fun for all ages,This magical movie is fun for anyone of any age and you don't have to understand the dialogue to watch it.  The creativeness is beautiful and I highly enjoyed watching this movie.  It was wonderful and brilliant.  I was 15 when i watched it and our whole Japanese class loved it.,
420,10 August 2007,dodo1066,7, A nice film for a quiet evening,"Firstly i have to say that i enjoyed this film. It was really beautiful to watch, especially with the rolling Japanese countryside, (as with all Miyakazi films) and was suitably short. Many of the scenes were innovative and i particularly enjoyed the cat bus scenes. However, as much as i liked the film, there were some major flaws, the main reason i only gave this film 7 out of 10. The first Miyakazi film i watched was Howl's Moving Castle, an epic film which i thoroughly enjoyed and watched multiple times. Howls Castle had a good script and good English voice-overs, but most importantly it had a credible plot and at the end of the film, i was left feeling i had achieved something by watching it. Unfortunately, this film didn't really go anywhere, and despite the fact i enjoyed it, i wasn't very pleased with it. The characters began to grate, especially the little child (Mia?), and the script was very weak. It may be that the English translation was very poor, and in that case, it was acceptable, but i was unimpressed with it at the end of the day. On the other hand, the shortness of the film saved it, and i would definitely recommend this as a good children's film, though I'm not sure it would appeal to a lot of adults, (i am typing here aware that a good deal of adults have commented and really enjoyed this film, but this is purely my humble opinion). I think 7 is a perfectly decent score for a perfectly decent film, but i think it is somewhat lacking in some departments, and that is a little bit disappointing.",

422,20 July 2003,nicolasstrappini,10," Magical, sweet, harmless.. gorgeous","Here's a movie that is entertaining, but also artistically stunning and suitable for everyone. Few films will encourage a big smile to emerge on your face as well this one, everything is just really cute and appealing. It's the greatest feel-good movie I've ever seen, just beating 'It's A Wonderful Life'. Thanks Mr. Miyazaki for another great animation! 10/10",
423,19 December 2009,jesse-lee-smith,10, My Favorite Miyazaki Film,"Maybe its nostalgia, because it was my first. Before I knew anything about anime or Miyazaki, I saw this on a rack at a supermarket in the early '90s and begged my mom to get it for me on VHS. And I'm so glad that she did, because this is one of the greatest films of all time. I liked it then, but I do remember thinking it was a bit slow and silly. But watching it now, its a wondrous tale of childhood and growing up. It's also the most different of Miyazaki's tales, I think, which gives it its own sort of value. Even though I feel this movie is perhaps spiritually closest to Spirited Away, a movie I never really liked all that much, it captures so well the awe of exploring as a child and the heartache of life's troubles seen through the lens of a child. This isn't so much a movie for children, but a movie about children for adults, a movie that allows them to travel back in time to when they were children. No movie so perfectly captures the magic of youth at My Neighbor Totoro.",

425,4 May 2021,ankitaghosh-54749,10, A movie to put smile on your face,This is a beautiful movie which will put a smile on your face no matter what. There is no moral advancement of the characters throughout the running minutes but I felt that was intended. This is a light hearted feel good movie and people should try to consume this as it was supposed to be. Must watch if you are going through a tough time. The chemistry between the two sisters will definitely put a smile on your face.,
426,1 February 2017,klovecat,10, I Love!!,"Okay, let me gush. I love My Neighbor Totoro SO MUCH, and watched it countless times when I was younger, along with other Studio Ghibli classics. This movie sparked my early imagination, opened up a world I had never cared to think of before. It makes me happy every time I watch it to this day. If you have kids, make sure they don't miss out on this and other titles like it (ie. Ponyo, Kiki's Delivery Service.) I promise it'll be memorable for you, too. I've never met anyone who regretted watching, it deserves such high praise.",
427,22 April 2006,ynotmd,8," great film, but watch it with subtitles!!!!!","Although I'm not a big fan of stories with no real conflict or character depth, Totoro was an admirable feature. I could have easily watched this film without sound and enjoyed it. The quality of the mise-en-scene was astounding. Nowhere besides in Japanese cinema do you get such images; The long shots, with little or no movement, a form of sentimentality in its most subtle form; The blending of colour so soft that the softest of sunsets cannot match this films tranquility; Combining images of normality and comfort with images of the fantastic, making us feel that even the typical is an extraordinary event. Cinema is not about story telling. The true cinematic masterpiece tells a story with images. The true cinema is a dynamic series of impressions. It is why two directors can use the same screenplay and make two completely different films. I would never view this film for its narrative merit, but would see it again simply for the power of its image. This movie is deserving of the title ""Great Cinema""",
428,9 October 2000,almonme,10, One of my all time favorites...,"... for many reasons: the minimalistic storytelling, the totally believable human characters (and the adorable, magical fantastic characters), the beauty of the drawings and the music, and the compelling story.

It was full of good emotions. I laughed, I was scared, and I feel worried from inside. I also liked that magical atmosphere. The wish that one had met one of those spiritual things has grown in me. The vibe of that lovable Japanese village and culture was fantastic. I could even smell the rice, and I could hear the crickets sound. Watching this movie was a wonderful experience.",
430,30 May 2022,jugglergirl,10, A nice simple animated film,"A great simple film with no complicated storyline. If you like movies where a lot is happening you probably won't like this movie. It's almost a ""day in the life"" kind of film. We see the normal routine of Mei and Satsuki, playing, bathing, eating, etc...Visually very gorgeous with wonderful scenery, it made me want to live in a place like it. My favorite thing is, that IMHO, it is one of the greatest representations of children in animated film, possibly in any type of film. I frequently noticed little things in the behavior of the children, especially Mei and Kanta and reminded me of things I've seen children do. I'm not sure which dub I watched but I loved Mei's shriek when she gets excited. The fact that there's not a whole lot of story and many of the scenes are slow with no or almost no dialogue allows you to simply watch the characters.",
431,17 August 2010,howard_andrew72,1, Why would Disney change the voice acting?,"I agree entirely with little-bird-2. When I was growing up, I would borrow this movie from my local library. I loved it so much. Years passed, and I ended up in a relationship with a person who actually had it on VHS! I was so excited about it, I told her we HAD to watch it that night. Well, fast forward another couple of years... I bought the special edition DVD, and I couldn't wait to watch it. Pop it in, and the first thing I noticed was the opening credits had a different singer. I was a little mad about that, but it was OK. But then the dialog started. I wasted $22.00. Everything was just too strange. The original voices were perfectly fine. If they ABSOLUTELY HAD TO change it, why couldn't they just keep the same dialog at the VERY least?",
432,5 September 2001,reverse_hsalf,10," Heartwarming, inspiring, adorable, believable.","Tortoro was my first exposure to Miyazaki and I have yet to see a movie animated or otherwise to surpass it. The characters are just that, real people that have real emotions. The simple storyline is given to the viewer instead of rammed down his/her throat. The feeling you get whilst watching just makes you want to wrap yourself in a massive thick warm blanket, and wander into the snow and watch the clouds go by. One of the quietest movies ever made in modern times but also one of the best.",
