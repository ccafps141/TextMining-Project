0,5 August 2016,TheLittleSongbird,9, A hotel well worth revisiting more than once,"That it was directed by Wes Anderson (who has a unique style that really fascinates, but admittedly not everybody will like or warm to his style) and that the cast is so stellar were reasons enough to see 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' in the first place, as well as its many accolades and critical acclaim.",/
1,15 June 2014,planktonrules,8, Strange and pretty much impossible to describe.,"Wes Anderson's films are really hard to describe or define. Suffice to say that he is unique in his style--very unique. This uniqueness is what makes ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" worth seeing. It's an odd story where a story is told within a story--and it's filled with famous actors making lots of odd cameos. And, like Anderson's other films, it's full of odd characters, unusual dialog and brisk-paced editing. And, not surprisingly, it's NOTHING like other films by other directors.",r

3,4 February 2015,lastliberal-853-253708,8, Keep your hands off my lobby boy!,"The Grand Hotel Budapest is a zany, colorful and fascinating journey through old postcard Europe, such as only Hollywood can think of. With his old, almost square picture format Wes Anderson pays tribute to recent days, but with the whole movie. In addition to his brilliant humor and endearing characters, this film captures gems with seemingly small details and meticulous compositions. For me, now one of the funniest and most original movies of 2014.",v
4,12 March 2014,bob-the-movie-man,8, A brilliantly entertaining fantasy outing by Wes Anderson,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is the latest from Wes Anderson, and what great fun it is. My review of Monuments Men pointed out that putting the likes of George Clooney, Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Jean Dujardin, Bill Murray and Hugh Bonneville in the same film was no guarantee of a good film. Following that logic, what should we make of the following turning up together: Ralph Fiennes, Bill Murray, F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Defoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Edward Norton, Tom Wilkinson, Saoirse Ronan, Owen Wilson and (a wonderfully made up) Tilda Swinton? The answer is a near masterpiece of cameos that add up to a highly entertaining and memorable film.",i
5,25 April 2014,jan_kalina,10," ""There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity... He was one of them. ""","Wes Anderson is one of the last directors -auteurs- who's got complete control on the film set and has the power to make whatever kind of film he desires. His distinct visual style is apparent since his 1996 debut Bottle Rcoket. But that was just a start, with every film he made he was perfecting his technique more and more. This marvelous attention to detail, the way he composes his shots( tracking shots, the symmetry, the characters running in slow-motion), chase scenes, love story, nostalgia, explanatory montages, the colourful set design and the prevalent theme of every one of his films: family. This all adds up to the reason why the audience enjoys Anderson's film so much. This all is brought to perfection in Grandhotel Budapest. ",e

9,23 July 2014,SnoopyStyle,9, A new high for Wes Anderson,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is an old relic in the eastern European former republic of Zubrowka. In 1985, the author of the book Grand Budapest Hotel (Tom Wilkinson) recounts how in 1968 he (Jude Law) got the story from Mr. Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). He talks about his early life as Lobby Boy (Tony Revolori) with the original concierge M. Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) in 1932 who was willed a priceless painting by Madame Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) setting off a battle with the woman's family led by her son Dimitri (Adrien Brody) and the violent Jopling (Willem Dafoe). Gustave is arrested for Madame D's murder. Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) is the girl of purity who's in love with Zero. Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum) is the executor of the will.",w
10,23 March 2014,zetes,10, Simply wonderful,"An extraordinary cinematic confection and probably Wes Anderson's greatest film. Ralph Fiennes plays the concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel in the 1930s, which exists in a fictional European country in the Alpine range. He has a habit of keeping some of the old women who stay at the hotel company. When one (Tilda Swinton) leaves him the valuable painting Boy with Apple, Swinton's evil son (Adrien Brody) frames Fiennes for the murder. Fiennes' closest companion, the hotel lobby boy Zero (Tony Revolori), and his girlfriend (Saorsie Ronan) conspire to free Fiennes from prison and sell the painting for loads of money, hopefully enabling them to leave the country, which is being overtaken by fascists. The story isn't much more than fluff (though there is a nice tinge of poignancy), but it's enormously amusing fluff. The highly amusing trailer did give away many of the film's best gags, but this is a laugh a minute movie. The visuals are absolutely delightful. Sure, it's all nothing you haven't seen before from Anderson, but I found it his most perfect accomplishment. The film is loaded with great cameos and little roles (the woman behind me almost had an orgasm when Bill Murray appeared), but my favorite was Willem Dafoe as a toothless heavy.",5
11,21 March 2014,Figgy66-915-598470,8," Entertaining, slightly farcical, tale of dark deeds and friendship","21 March 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - The Grand Budapest Hotel. I really had no idea what this film was about, having seen only one trailer which in the event, bore no relation to the plot whatsoever. However, my interest was piqued so this evening found me watching a splendid little film packed to the rafters with stars. This was the tale of Gustave H, the legendary and infamous Concierge of The Grand Budapest Hotel, a rather glamorous edifice perched atop a mountain and his protégé and most trusted friend Zero, The Lobby Boy. This is a tale of friendship, murder, revenge and deep dark plotting. There were some completely ridiculous moments which were quite refreshing and several, what I like to call Guffaw moments where several members of the audience emit a loud blast of laughter followed by slightly hysterical giggling that you find yourself joining in with. As I said a host of stars in this film ranging from Ralph Fiennes, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law and Bill Murray to Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson and Harvey Keitel to name a few, but one of the outstanding performances must go to Tony Revolori, a relatively unknown young actor who plays Zero, who is In almost every scene. An entertaining film, worth watching.",4
12,4 April 2014,vincentlynch-moonoi,7, A funny thing happened to me on the way to the Grand Budapest Hotel,"After seeing the previews several times, I thought I would enjoy a delightful almost-fantasy-like film. But, at age 64, after going to the movies literally hundreds of times in my lifetime, I did something today that I've only ever done 3 times previously -- I walked out of a movie halfway through the picture. I didn't blame Wes Anderson, because clearly his films have a following...but I thought it must be an acquired taste...that I had not acquired. I admitted that it was a uniquely visually pleasing film, but I wondered why so many fine actors agreed to what were rather small parts. At the time I said that this film bored me even more than ""Moonrise Kingdom"". ",8

Wunderkind filmmaker Wes Anderson continues to outdo himself in all matters of whimsy in this mirth-filled mischievous romp set in a fictional European country in flashback 1932 with bisexual bon vivant Fiennes (having a field day) as the concierge of the eponymous posh establishment taking a new 'lobby boy' (newcomer Revolori) under his wing as mentor/protégé and embroiled in an inheritance battle of wits involving a priceless painting, thuggish vulgarians and a dash of sharp-witted observations thrown in for good measure. Resplendent production design by Adam Stockhausen, Robert D. Yeoman's picture perfect cinematography and a cheeky screenplay by Anderson and Hugo Guinness inspired by Stefan Zweig's canon the film is a well-oiled machinery enmeshed with a crazy quilt more-than-a-cameo filled cast of Who's Who all relishing their moments however brief of irreverency and tact(less) behavior.

19,20 January 2015,Turfseer,4," In the Anderson oeuvre, there's a lot to see, but he has hardly anything to say","Wes Anderson is back at it again with another one of his quirkfests, this time entirely convincing most critics that he's crafted a masterpiece. Most are mesmerized by the production design, which truly deserves an Academy Award. Anderson opted to use miniatures for wide shots of the hotel and did extensive research for the interiors. The Görlitzer Warenhaus, a defunct German department store which survived World War II, was a stand-in for the Grand Budapest's lobby. Anderson's cinematography, which features all kinds of shots from unusual angles was probably another reason the critics were so impressed with the film (take note of the prison escape scene in particular). But I believe critic Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice gets it right when she concludes that Anderson's narrative, is wholly one-note in nature: ""This meticulously appointed doll house of a movie just went on and on, making me want to smash many miniature plates of plaster food in frustration.""",r

21,22 November 2014,Vartiainen,8, Fantastically unorthodox,"A movie hearkening back to the days between the World Wars, to a time where properness, good manners and dignity still reigned supreme. All in good fun, of course. The Grand Budapest Hotel is the best kind of comedy because it refuses to admit it's one. The events are humorous, of course, as are the character, but those characters always act seriously, as if the bizarre things happening around them are the norm. There's no winking at the audience, except on a story level.",f
22,23 April 2014,billygoat1071,10, Keeping Things Classy,"Wes Anderson is pretty much the kind of director who never betrays his cinematic trademark no matter how small and unconventional it looks. Just like most of his films, the style and personality are written all over it, from aesthetics to pizazz, but compare this to the others, The Grand Budapest Hotel crafts something that is nearly otherworldly which (obviously) makes it very charming. It is a part thriller and part comedy film that is perfectly coated by its artistic panache, but looking deep within the structure, you may also find a bunch of witty humor and rich character development from the two leads which makes it a really special experience.",_
23,16 January 2015,samfischer88,10, Wes Anderson's Finest,"Wes Anderson has done it again. Grand Budapest Hotel is the best of 2014. This film shows the genius of Anderson with his quirky, different style of filmmaking. The writing and filming designs are some of the best and unique in Hollywood today. Grand Budapest Hotel is definitely more of a piece of art than ordinary movie. The cast includes huge names in Ralph Fiennes, F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Etc. Ralph Fiennes gives his best performance in years as M. Gustave. He really brings a uniqueness that fits well with the movie. He was rewarded with a Golden Globe nomination. He has some quick humor and energy that keeps the film moving. Wes Anderson mainstays Adrien Brody, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and Jess Goldblum give Grad Budapest the classic Wes Anderson feel. The storyline takes you on an adventure. It is a story that only Anderson could tell. The effects are a bit different than most movies but fit the theme. M. Gustave (Fiennes) and his story will make you appreciate Anderson in a new way. By far the best of 2014.",=
24,29 December 2014,classicsoncall,8," ""Did he just throw my cat out the window?""","I don't know if you'd call Wes Anderson an acquired taste or not; I didn't like 'The Life Aquatic' very much and felt the subject matter for ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is part of the reason the culture is hitting bottom of the barrel levels these days. Yet this film held a strange fascination for me that's tough to put a finger on. I enjoy movies with rapid fire dialog, and crusty language doesn't bother me, so those features of the picture delivered quite well. There was also the stylized CGI used in the scenes of the hotel itself and that very odd funicular railway construct that seemed just the right sort of bizarre for my taste. I managed to recognize virtually all the cameo players except for Tilda Swinton and Harvey Keitel, the rest were on either side of hilarious. Willem Dafoe's Jopling character was particularly over the top and made for an intriguing assassin. The story itself was rather interesting, a sort of offbeat heist and murder mystery, but with elements that defy classification. I guess with Anderson's films you have to take them one by one. This one I could take a couple more times.",t

26,29 March 2014,lee_eisenberg,9, think pink for a look at the days of yore,"So far I've liked every Wes Anderson movie that I've seen, and that includes ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". This comedic tale of murder and mayhem in inter-war Europe has everything that we expect in Anderson's movies: dolly shots, pronounced colors, and quirky characters. Watching the movie, I got the feeling that Anderson made it with the aim of appealing to a larger audience due to some scenes that tended more towards action. Not that it subtracts from the good stuff in the movie. One thing that struck me is that even though the movie takes place in a fictional country in Central Europe, every cast member uses his/her real voice: we hear American, English and French accents. It's as though this country is a microcosm of the entire Western world.",_

32,20 February 2014,saschakrieger,8, Welcome to the dream factory,"Film is often compared to dreams, after all Hollywood us called the ""dream factory"", leading us into strange lands that often only exist as long as the lights are low and the projector is running. So it is only fitting that the world's largest film festival would open with an elaborate and visually overwhelming dream. Such is Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel, telling the story of Zero, a lobby boy at a luxury hotel in a pre-war fantasy state who is mentored by the legendary concierge Monsieur Gustave and plunges into an epic adventure with him. The film is a brightly colored tour de force, hilariously funny, a crazy comic book world full of strange and enchanting creatures. A passing, temporary world in which one can, for a short time, live or at least imagine a dream life. Like a hotel. The visuals are astounding, the story-telling, fast-paced, inventive, always surprising, the characters quirky, grotesque, lovable. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a gigantic and excessively sweet candy floss kind of a movie full of a stellar cast on the edge of quirkiness, a wildly entertaining ride that fully exploits film's ability to create fantasy worlds that still manage to lay bare hints of the world we know. For despite all the colorfulness, the film also tells the story of a world threatened by war and violence, a dream long turned into nightmare. The Grand Budapest Hotel has its redundancies (such as the present day framing story) but it is a beautiful homage to the past we have lost but are encouraged to re- create and create anew with the greatest gift we have: imagination. And ultimately, it is a tribute to that wonderful dream machine we call cinema filled with hints and associations for those who want to find them (down to such a detail as the aspect ratio) – albeit one that doesn't take itself too seriously. Which might be its most charming and enchanting quality.",

In this hotel that used to be the place-to-be to all the visitors from Europe, there was a professional, no-nonsense but not without a debonair quality of his own, concierge, his name was Gustav.

34,15 June 2014,Robert_duder,9, A total surprise gem for me and possibly one of the most unique comedies I have ever seen,"I think I've seen a few Wes Anderson movies and I know his reputation for being very eccentric and quirky in his films. Its not usually my cup of tea but after experiencing The Grand Budapest Hotel I might have to re-address the opinion and watch some more of his work. I'm not a big fan of comedy, least of all dirty, raunchy stupid comedy but this comedy was like nothing I have ever seen and it turns out was right up my alley. Make no mistake, this is a comedy. This is the sort of zany, outrageous comedy that made Monte Python an iconic group. The story makes perfect sense and is not confusing in the least and yet this incredibly bizarre cast of characters in an incredibly outrageous series of events feels completely surreal. Its just some of the most random things happening and yet you're laughing and shaking your head at the insanity of it all. In addition to that this was easily one of the most visually stunning, colourful, and outrageous set design I have ever seen. This ""faux"" European backdrop turns this into the ultimate fairy tale for adults. The Grand Budapest Hotel should have been an Oscar contender if not for visual style than just how incredibly unique it is. This proves that there are still some original ideas kicking around in Hollywood and Wes Anderson deserves mounds of credit.",

Only with the recent multiple Oscar nominations of this movie, I decide to give this a chance. And guess what: it is a great movie, his best since the Royal Tennenbaums. Set mostly in the 1930s in a fictional Central European state (the film was mostly shot in Southern Germany) - though with a nifty introduction from the 1960s that frames the narrative with Jude Law and F. Murray Abraham - the Grand Hotel Budapest tells the story of the said hotel - one in the classical European style - that is run by the concierge M.

Anderson's latest, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is very much in the audacious visual style of his previous comic fantasies - absurd situations, oddball characters, and zany action unfolding at a frantic pace. Here, however, the film's unique voice and compelling performances has an underlying humanity that celebrates the social fabric of a civilized society where sensitivity and consideration for others had not yet gone the way of the hula hoop.",

Rather than mention the plot, I will say that the language flowed with grace and humor. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) our main character had the ability to be classy while being crude. The harpsichord soundtrack fit well into the production. One could see where classical action/comedy/romance films of the 50's and 60's have influenced the film until it spoofs them in a generic fashion.

47,25 January 2015,bix171,7, Dazzling Visuals To The Rescue,"Another drolly twee film from Wes Anderson, better than some of his previous work (""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"", ""Rushmore"") but not nearly as good as others (""The Royal Tenenbaums"", ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox""). Here, he assembles a mighty cast, with Ralph Fiennes starring as the fastidious and ambiguous manager of a distant eastern European hotel (located in the fictitious Republic of Zubrowka; the action takes place between world wars), whose care of his guests extends beyond the usual service and who gets involved with the nefarious family of one of his elderly lovers, led by son Adrian Brody (who, by wearing pseudo-Nazi clothing, unthinkably undermines his most famous role, the persecuted Jew of ""The Pianist""). This being Anderson, it's all about cadence: he expends an awful lot of energy synchronizing his actors' responses and the rhythms of the music (a winning score by Alexandre Desplat). But really, that's all it's about--the film is completely inconsequential nonsense. Sure, it's entertaining while you're watching it but you're completely aware that what you're watching has no real substance. All the performers competently perform to Anderson's stylized, obsessive/compulsive standards but the true stars of the film are Adam Stockhausen's gorgeous production design, Anna Pinnock's intricate set decoration and the fun art direction, led by Stephan O. Gessler: it's easy to get lost in the dazzling visuals, especially when there's no real need to pay attention to what's going on in the forefront. Conceivably, it may even be better with no sound--certainly, the overall design recalls the era of silent film.",

49,31 March 2014,Hitchcoc,9, Off the Wall Delightful,"It's so nice to have a movie that is knock-down drag-out hilarious. From the beginning foray, telling us about how the hotel came to be, all of its history, and the introduction of the cast of characters, the delightful episodic delivery, it reminded me to some extent of those spectacular comedies of the sixties and seventies: ""The Great Race"" and ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World."" What transpires is Ralph Fiennes' feast for the camera and a story of great love, pain, and intensity. What works well is that there is a balance between a serious dramatic line running through a serious story that is inundated with sight gags and wonderful bits. The prison break will live with me forever, the little hammers and chisels smuggled into the prison inside boxes of strawberry torts. The quirky people from Jeff Goldblum to Willem Dafoe to the irrepressible Adrian Brody. So much has already been written about this but I wanted to get my two cents worth.

The location, the people, the names, they are all scrambled into something completely fictional, but very recognizable. The plot is just a jumble of stuff that just happens sequentially, but is quite inconsequential. The main character is neither of the great actors who are in the cast, but this too real fictional world that none of us are old enough to remember, but all know.",

This is the premise for the movie, but to watch it was boring. The movie is filmed as if you are watching a play inside a dollhouse, if that makes any sense. The so-called comedy is just pretentious and snob. Of course some people find that funny, but for me it didn't do it. The entire movie didn't do it... It could have been a wonderful adventure, but I found the manner and style it was conceived to be too boring and pointless. The acting is excellent and that saved the movie from being a complete waste of time. This definitely isn't a movie for the masses, and that being said, isn't a movie that an average movie goer will enjoy. For some that's a good thing maybe, but for me this wasn't entertaining.

64,8 April 2014,Likes_Ninjas90,7," Anderson is at the middle of point of his life, considering the uncertainty of the world","What is it that people enjoy about Wes Anderson's films? He is a rarity in an industry determined to standardise cinema. It is impossible to duplicate the tone and the direction of an Anderson film without drawing comparisons. Since his first feature Bottle Rocket (1996) his films have developed their own cult following because of his unique stylistic choices. His films are highly formal and dictated by deadpan humour, rapid fire quips and quirky details. There is also a balance between pure charm and humanity when he focuses on his most persistent theme, the family unit. Yet he has never been known for his restraint. By writing his own scripts, he can sometimes be his own worst enemy. He overloads his films with strange details that can feel overly ambiguous and purposeless. Audiences don't seem to mind. Moonrise Kingdom (2012) was the biggest hit of the seven films that he had made. It earned more than fifty million dollars, which says people are willing to embrace films that are unique and sometimes challenging. This year the Texan- born filmmaker is forty-five, which is a crucial age for any filmmaker looking to solidify their relevancy. How do you continue to make such imagination accessible to a broadening audience? The Grand Budapest Hotel proves Anderson is still navigating between independent filmmaking and mainstream cinema and looking for a new direction. While most of his films have centred on American families, this is the first story that he has set in Europe and also in a retrospective time period. His quirkiness and the humour are still intact but it's more accessible due to conventional and sometimes safer narrative techniques.",
65,13 June 2014,ironhorse_iv,8, The Grand Budapest Hotel was pretty grand!,"You can always tell when you're watching a Wes Anderson's film with all his director motifs. Like Tim Burton, Wes Anderson's films always have a distinctive style. You just have to be a semi fan of his work to get enjoy it. If not, this movie isn't for you. Grand Budapest Hotel is just as amazing to watch like his other whimsical films. One thing, that bother me, is the direction of the narrative. The movie is told through four people, in three different time-lines. The movie couldn't figure out who should tell this movie. It was bit annoying. The first is an unnamed young girl who reads an author's (Tom Wilkinson) book in the present day, about his time at the Grand Budapest Hotel. Then it's told by the young author now played by Jude Law in the 1960s, whom meets the hotel owner, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). Then it's told by Zero who recounts to him, how he got the hotel as a young man (Tony Revolori) in 1932, but the movie isn't really about him. You can really see, how this is frustration. The movie should only focus on the story of M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). All of the other beginning stories wasn't needed. M. Gustave was the best part of the film, and wonderfully play by Ralph Fiennes. By far, my favorite character, he help created. Gustave is very dapper and elegant and courteous and impressively foul mouthed. What a great character. M. Gustave is a legendary concierge at a famous European hotel in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka, a European alpine state. Still, I don't know why it is call Grand Budapest Hotel, when it's nowhere near Budapest? The movie also have a fictional World War 2, as Zubrowka's ""Zig-Zag"" fascist and Communism movement fight for control of the country as a backdrop. With its mix of German, Hungarian and Slavic naming elements, Catholicism, fallen nobility and rising fascists Zubrowka is strongly reminiscent of the former lands of the Austro-Hungarian Empire between the wars. Anyways, when the elder Madame D. (Tilda Swinton in great make up) dies a mysterious death. M. Gustave is framed for her death and sent to prison. Mid-while, the story kinda get way more complex, involving theft and recovery of a priceless Renaissance painting and the battle for an enormous family fortune. I like how his films consistently center on the importance of and interaction between families. I found the relationship between M. Gustave and young Zero to be the greatest piece of the film. Still, the movie did had way too many characters. The movie has a lot of Wes Anderson recurring actors as side or minor characters like Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson and others. Honestly, some of these characters were not really needed, but seem write in, so he can get some of his friends, a paycheck. Since Anderson film usually features an ensemble cast and a sprawling plot line, not every character get told. The odd telling of what happen to Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) seem lazy. Show it, don't tell it. It kinda lost the emotional impact, by just mentioning it, without showing. I didn't mind the bittersweet ending about M. Gustave, because the movie invested more into that character than Agatha, but it seem wrong, not to show, what happen to them. It seem a lot of the plot conclusion was unfinished. After all, the movie never truly tells how M. Gustave prove his innocent, or who killed him. The film was inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig. The film has bits from 1939 novel 'Beware of Pity' and 1982 'The Post Office Girl"". You see that in Anderson's films, that he truly love art. Indeed, it's an art-film about loving art. His films are full of charmingly obscure references to old music, theater, literature, paintings and photography. The locations that they use are beautiful. I love the nostalgia look of the clothes, you really get the time period. I also didn't mind the use of handmade miniature models. It was funny to see it, but fits in with the mood of the story, so well. The Deadpan comedy works so well, in this movie. I wouldn't stop, laughing. The silly dialogue is delivered in such a serious way that makes it fun to watch. I'm a sucker for smart comedies. I didn't like the lack of European accents. It was alright. The movie does have some harsh language, but unlike other modern comedies. It's works with the story, because it used to expression deep emotion depth, than a misplace adjective. The violence can be a bit too violent at times. This might be Anderson's darkest, most violent film yet. I really think some people might hate what happen to a certain cat in the film. The movie did a few scenes of nudity that could had been cut. It wasn't need. Overall: The movie takes the cake. In this case, Mendl's Courtesan au Chocolats. It's a good well-made movie with some faults",

But Anderson's movies, so widely feted, leave be not only cold, but mystified. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', for example, conjures up beautifully a comically rendered vision of Mitteleuropean splendour fading into Nazism and communism in a way that should appeal to me. But in that world, Anderson tells a one-note story devoid of any human depth. To contrast, consider a movie like 'Delicatessan', for example, which is also set in a tragi-comic alternative world; but which tells a story full of very real emotion. To me, the richness of that movie's reality is light years away from the complete shallowness of Anderson's work. As I said, it's as if there's something that's sailing completely over my head; either that, or there's an audience completely unconcerned by the absence of substance. But I'm not part of it.",

His choice of adjusting the screen format, his color pallets and sleek cinematography are what save this movie from being a flop. Yes, it is great directing. Yes the performances, especially Ralph Fiennes, are top notch. This is a decent movie, but decent is where it stops. It doesn't have anything to separate itself from previous quirky and dark humor filled films that Wes Anderson has released, it doesn't have the heart from Moonrise Kingdom, the charisma of The Fantastic Mr. Fox, or the mystique from The Darjeeling Limited. Yes, every director may have their own styles and tweak it differently for each of their works, but Wes Anderson only adds some minor plot differences to his films to make them slightly ""different,"" yet still far too similar. I have been fine with them in the past, but by The Grand Budapest Hotel, his fourth main entry, the goofy style becomes a little tedious and actually difficult to get through in some scenes. Many trivial things are presented as important matter in drawn out sequences, making it all the more difficult to watch. Yes, I am harshly bad mouthing this movie, but I did still find some enjoyment in watching the gorgeous film making and the once in while funny script, but come the third act, all the twists just become much too predictable, and ultimately unsatisfying.

That may also be its problem. As interesting as the film would seem to be theoretically, it seems as hollow and superficial as a picture postcard. Its extraordinary cast members (which includes 11 previous Oscar nominees and 5 Oscar winners) posture themselves like mannequins throughout a fast-paced exercise that feels no deeper than an elaborate puppet show. Admittedly, I've had a long-term aversion to Anderson's 'style', so annoying in its contrived stance of false naiveté. While overwhelmed by the beauty in every sequence, I search in vain for the least empathy with a single character and any emotion beyond the superficial. Many swoon over this film, but its adoration to me makes more sense on a sociological level in sync with the Twitter and Instagram sound-bite age we live in. As I said to a good friend (who's a Wes Anderson fan) after we left the theater, ""How could anyone spend so much money on such a marvelous cast and such gorgeous images and produce something so shallow and emotionless?"" I'm still waiting for the answer.",
96,28 March 2014,Kicino,9, Ultimately enjoyable movie experience: worth watching again,"For me, it needs two viewings to fully appreciate it. Maybe I was too tired and too preoccupied in the first show. The second viewing helps me appreciate the picture much much more. It is like a very tightly-knit symphony. Every note, every frame, every line is carefully crafted and precisely shot. Perhaps with a background in advertising, director Wes Anderson is very conscious of his airtime. Watching this film turns out to be a very rich movie viewing experience – visually and graphically, in background music and of course the animation-like exaggerating acting. But the most important is the positive message on humanity. What a pleasure to watch. ",
97,30 March 2014,mmipyle,1, A movement of the bowels,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD: Based on a preview trailer my wife and I saw at a theater recently, and based on reviews and other small things we'd seen in the interim, both of us went to the theater yesterday to see ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (2014). Evidently, it is so popular it is showing in three different parts of the theater we attended! Well, within five minutes - I literally mean five minutes - of the beginning, the 'humor' had dropped to a sophomoric level. Within ten minutes the attempt had dropped to freshman level. By fifteen minutes of the show, the scene had shifted from the Grand Budapest Hotel to another place and I was beginning to wonder where this - this thing - was going. We were now at an eighth grade level, and all was looking as if it were going to skip a few grades - downward - in the very near future. By an hour into this - thing - I was looking how many people I needed to crawl in front of to leave, and I realized it was far too many. Willm Dafoe had turned into a Hannibal Lecter-like nasty without the hunger pangs, just sadistic beyond three-year-old anger fits. Ralph Fiennes' lines had become so cynical - and this was supposed to be funny! - that the humor level had dropped to near unborn - it was far below Kindergarten. Although it is a delicacy in Tuscany, kid veal is illegal in the United States where veal needs to be at least two and a half years of age. Humor should be the same way. Unborn humor should be illegal here, too. I know of no place where it is a delicacy, however. By the time the hour and forty minutes of the film had passed, we both realized that we had witnessed no movement of the stars: rather, the show was more a movement of the bowels. We realized that the characters were possibly not as dysfunctional as the writers themselves had been. We also realized that the film was a function of Dis. Hell hath mo' fury when a man is horned. All's hell that ends in hell. We'd been there, and now we could finally leave and go get a pizza. I wasn't necessarily hungry, but I ate voraciously if only to forget...",
98,13 December 2018,deloudelouvain,8, A grand movie.,"Not being a big fan of Oscar winning movies normally, the year 2015 was a great year for the Oscars. Great movies like The Theory of Everything, Still Alice, The Imitation Game and Interstellar, were all worthy competitors like The Grand Budapest Hotel was. It was a difficult year to chose the best from all those movies. The Grand Budapest Hotel won 4 Oscars and it deserved them all. No Oscars for actors though, and that's because of the quality of the other movies, as Ralph Fiennes did a great job in this movie playing M. Gustave. The young Tony Revolori as Zero, the lobby boy, was also a delight to watch. The rest of the cast, with great names as Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray etc, they all have minor roles but it says enough about the quality of the cast and the movie. Probably Wes Anderson's best as thus far. The movie is very pleasant to watch as it is told in a funny but very structured way. It looks like everybody is walking in a straight stiff line, what gives this movie that something special. The cinematography is also a delight to watch, it's all very horizontal and vertical, every shot is rehearsed until it looks all strangely normal. Not only is it well shot but the story is also captivating enough to keep you amused and entertained. Definitely one of the better movies of that year.",

This one, by contrast, was awful, and to me it suggests he has become ""full of himself"" or is ""mailing it in."" It's not funny, nor insightful, nor compelling on any level. At the very beginning, the worn, 1960s decor was amusing, and overall I got the sense that this was going to be about a small number of ""quirky"" hotel guests in the mid 1980s. These were people who were trapped in the past, but didn't know how to move forward because they had enough money to keep them at the ""luxury resort hotel.""

He did a terrific job. The lobby boy named Zero Mustafa also did a terrific job. Every performance is first rate here. The art direction, costumes, and makeup truly deserved their Academy Awards. The movie is just enjoyable all around with a wicked sense of humor all around. This is the kind of film that you enjoy watching repeatedly. It has a wonderful original score.

I can however judge that I had a grand old time watching Grand Budapest Hotel at the theatre. Stylistically, it was a triumph. It seemed almost every frame was filmed at right angles (90 degrees) - either facing the camera, left profile, right profile, back or from the top - with a few exceptions. I personally don't like when actors talk directly to the camera as so often happens here, but I didn't mind it this time. It even created a weird sense of intimacy. There was also a noticeable amount of rectangles and squares in the meticulously constructed frames with very little camera movement in those frames. It was like a succession of tableaux and, for lack of better expression, geometrically inspired and fascinating. The use of the bright colors, how they matched, was also stupendous, making for gorgeous scenes.",

If you're familiar with Wes Anderson's wholly unique style, then you know what you're getting into here: eye-popping visuals and endearingly quirky characters. The dialogue grabs you by the ears and doesn't let go, and the most hilarious lines come seemingly out of nowhere. It features a gonzo cast, with just a laundry list of talent, and it's almost every few minutes that a familiar face turns up. ",

My wife fell asleep (literally) and about two hundred others around us sat in uninterrupted silence as a litany of dreary antics and pratfalls ensued. Truthfully, there were no more than a handful of audible giggles throughout the entire length of the film. Personally, I found it mildly humorous at best. One interesting aspect was watching the long list of cameo appearances by so many well-known names, while the story, within a story, within a story narration was mildly intriguing. The chase scene in the snow was insufferably long and cartoonish. Such a disappointment.",
105,23 September 2015,KineticSeoul,9, Grand movie,"This is a whimsical and meticulously crafted film by Wes Anderson. And I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. It's one of those films that you just don't want it to end. The design and cinematography of this film is just meticulously and immaculately shot. We Anderson is one of the few directors that has a lot of control over his projects and carries with him, his trademark style. All the actors did a fantastic job with their roles. They really did a great job of bringing the characters to life. I liked the tangled web of hope and disillusionment, faith and cynicism in this story. The character that stands out the most in this is of course the main protagonist Monsieur Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) the Grand Budapest's devoted concierge. He is huberous but a bit delirious as well, charming but a bit manipulative, controlling and fastidious character. He is vain cynical person that isn't entirely likable, but has my sympathy. In another words, he is a flawed hero in this story that has the characteristics of a quick-witted fox. I first thought most of the story will revolve around characters in a hotel and how they go about it. However it turns out this is a immaculate caper film. Overall, this is a hysterical adventure I wouldn't mind seeing again. ",

108,29 June 2014,westsideschl,8, Jaw Dropping Opulence,"Whether the hotel rooms' sets came from custom set design; cgi; or actual filming locations it was all jaw dropping engaging in its opulence. The film showcases that period between wars in eastern Europe when fortunes rapidly rose only to just as rapidly dissipate. We follow those fortunes and lifestyles through the guests, workers and others whose lives intersect with the hotel's rise & fall. Not only the sets, but the props and costuming were all period appropriate first rate. The painted mat backdrop for the hotel gave an other-worldly fantastical feel to the film's locality. On the downside the script itself was uneven - not polished thus not comfortably easy for a viewer to get hooked into the plot's digressions. The acting, on the other hand, was superb. It completely sold that not-quite- real fantasy feel to the story.",

The film is bright, colorful, and features exquisite cinematography as well as a delightful score from Alexandre Desplat-which finally got him his first Oscar. This film is funny as well with a great screenplay, which worked thanks to the amazing cast. ",
111,7 November 2019,Tralequang,10, A much pleasing watch.,"I am most impressed by the story telling: it is fast and propelling. I was almost always kept seated, due to the feeling that the climax was about to happen. This and the style of abrupt cutting between scenes reminds of Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Lock, stock and two smoking barrels. There is something comedic and intriguing about them.
The main characters are well built, and the acting did enough to demonstrate it.
The visual is stunning, as I expected before viewing. There is one short sexual shot, and one violent-implying shot, which is great. Keep it natural, no need for PG-13 :D
The anachronistic-ally noble behaviors and etiquette of the main character was a fun to watch. (This certainly reminds me of Kingsman). By showing such usually-ridiculous man under such a positive light, I believe Wes Anderson meant this movie to be a lament of a lifestyle long lost in the course of time.",

As the film opens we see an author (played by Tom Wilkinson) who talks about his days back then while at the grand Budapest hotel (who is now played by Jude Law) and sees a man named Zero Moustafa (played by F. Murray Abraham) and talks to him about his times with Monsieur Gustave (played by Ralph Fiennes) as the lobby boy of the hotel. Out of the 9 Oscar nominations that his film received I really think it should win 2 for best costume design, and best production design, the casting to this film is excellent (besides Fiennes, Abraham, Wilkinson, and Law) it also includes Willem Dafoe as a hit-man, Jeff Goldblum as a lawyer, as well as Wes Anderson regular Bill Murray as a hotel staff member, and Saiorse Ronan as the lobby boy's wife Agatha, as well as Adrien Brody as Gustave's nemesis Dimitri, and the unrecognizable Tilda Swinton as the old woman who stayed at the hotel for 19 years and was found dead in her bed from strychnine poisoning.

120,13 March 2014,ejknowles26,10, An absolute banger,"This was the best film that I have seen in some time. Everything from the beautiful backdrops to the gently funny script kept me riveted from start to finish. There was more plot line than in many of Anderson's earlier films, which probably makes it more accessible to a general audience. The two main characters, Gustave and Zero, had great chemistry which helped push through any points where the story might have lagged. Ralph Fiennes was absolutely cracking, but there wasn't a bad performance from any of the actors in this, of which there were many. Giving bit-parts to everyone you know might seem a bit cheeky, but all the parts fit with the feel of the film. The framing of almost every shot by a pillar or just pretty colour selection made the whole thing fit in a fairytale era, which an old Zero mentions near the end of the film may not have existed for a long time. Though the ending is bitter-sweet I came out of the pictures grinning, and am still in the afterglow. Top notch quirky entertainment. I heartily endorse this product. xxx",

His awesome attention to detail and how he shoots his movies won me over with Moonrise and now, with, GBH I'm convinced Wes Anderson is one of the best, original directors we have today. There's a lot going on in this movie: A girl is visiting a memorial and reading a book by a Nameless Author. Meanwhile, the Author narrates this book for us about a lonely hotel owner who then tells the Author a story about his start as a young Lobby Boy being trained by the then hotel concierge. There's a painting theft, a ski chase, a great and suspenseful museum foot chase. This movie is on through the entire time. When it's not giving you a scene filled with great dialog from it's wonderful cast, you're admiring the typically beautiful set design. The script does a great job of using each setting in the movie and throwing in some surprisingly intense sequences. That museum scene is my favorite and there's awesomely shot shootout at the end that kind acts as a cherry on top of the sundae. The dream team cast is near perfect, as with all Wes Anderson movies. Ralph Feinnes is brilliant and carries the movie IMO, any man that can go from the evil Dark Lord to leading a comedy and nailing it is aces in my book. There's a lot of cool smaller roles, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum stand out. Again this film is technically flawless as well. The cinematography and music fit well and direction is perfect.

I don't remember much, as it's been a while since either, but the one element that remained with me was the incredibly unique style of the filmmaker. I've heard and read plenty about Wes Anderson's talents, seen the praise heaped on his work, but it wasn't until the release of THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL that I made a point to seek it out. The trailer was hilarious and the visuals were gorgeous, and a lot of people were claiming it to be one of Anderson's more accessible films so I figured I'd use it to see if he might be a director I want to check into further. Thanks to THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL, the answer is a resound yes. I loved this movie. It's framed as a story within a story within a story. We open with an introduction from an unnamed author (Tom Wilkinson) who penned the tale that's about to unfold based on the experiences of Zero Moustafa, the owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel with whom he'd become acquainted during a visit in the late '60s. It tells of an adventure he'd become entangled in when first hired as a lobby boy at the hotel in the '30s under the tutelage of the hotel's most famous concierge, Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). Gustave had a reputation for forming intimate relationships with the elderly ladies who came to the hotel and, when one such beloved rich guest dies under mysterious circumstances, Gustave is willed a rather valuable painting in her passing. This draws the ire of the woman's selfish son, Dmitri (Adrien Brody), and sends Gustave on the run with his trusted lobby boy Zero when Dmitri accuses him of his mother's murder.

The film begins with an old man telling a story to a younger man and we find out that the old man is the owner of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" and worked as a lobby boy many decades ago under Ralph Fiennes' central character. This film is very Wes Anderson: the straight camera shots at objects people, the unique set decorations and the subtle humor from start to finish in the script, especially the way Fiennes' character interacts with everybody.

The film gets up and running incredibly quickly, almost too fast for a movie that takes place in a book within a flashback and within a second flashback—Anderson uses three different aspect ratios to inform viewers of where we are in the timeline. At 100 minutes, it feels like the cast and crew downed several quad-venti's and got to filming; seriously, the movie may have actually been better with a little fat, maybe an extra 20 or 30 minutes just so the audience can absorb what's going on. Don't mean to pry too much, as it is indeed an overall lovely picture.",
141,2 March 2014,pj-bus,8, Looks beautiful and is a lot of fun,Well I had not seen a Wes Anderson film before and I was attracted to this by the trailer which is full of lovely looking shots.,
142,2 February 2018,TheOny13,9, The beginning of the end of the end of the beginning has begun! (Spoiler free review),I went in to this movie not knowing anything about its plot or story. I only knew it was about the adventures of some hero from a Budapest Hotel. Honestly I didn't think this movie was going to be any good since its plot wasn't that much interesting but I though I'd give it a try since it was the only movie from the 2015 Oscars highlights I didn't saw. Now I can say that I was not wrong because this movie succeeds as a comedy with some absurd scenes that had me laughing very hard and with characters that are really well done. Aside from that this movie in my opinion had some issues. Mainly the story is very weird told and I was bored for most of the movie although I understood the main thing of the movie and this whole adventure Gustavo and Zero had. The movie never emphasised the characters who were important to the story... I get the movie had to be absurdly funny but you need to catch the viewer's attention with a plot that can be followed and interesting and characters that are introduced properly. I was continuously asking myself who's this? Who's that? Because the movie's story went on like I was supposed to know who those characters were. But putting that aside there were things I liked like the absurd humor that sometimes had me laughing very hard and the way the movie was constructed. It's been told like a multi-layered story that goes from present to the past with 4 levels of story which made it really interesting in that perspective. Apart from that there were some extremely well done scenes and the movie as a whole was very colorful with some of the best cinematography (I honestly would have given the oscar for cinematography to this movie not to Birdman) although I literally can't understand how Interstellar was not nominated that year. Overall a funny movie with some interesting characters and a multi-layered story and absurd humor. 9/10.,

147,27 August 2014,victuki,10, A Masterpiece From Beginning to End,"Sometimes, if you want to know if certain films are worth watching, you have to rely on which cast is involved. Great actors are usually into great projects. This case is no different. The cast is outstanding, and the list is long, from F. Murray Abraham, Tilda Swinton, Jude Law, the always brilliant Willem Dafoe, Edward Norton, and so on and so forth. And then Ralph Fiennes, complete king of the show, simply spectacular in every bit of it. Wes Anderson, who directed ""Life Aquatic""( 2004), or ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001) is back with this little big project. And it is so because it is an intimate story, yet embedded in a large scale game play, a massive project from an artistic point of view; every character and event is paramount in this little poem. This ""Chinese box"" kind of filmmaking, a story within a story, is what Anderson uses to tell us this tale. It is a classic literary device, and like in literature, it might involve the same issue, namely the narrator reliability, (though in the film the veracity of the events is emphasized), so everything could be a wild imagination from the narrator, which may be even better for the purpose of the whole thing. I'm sticking with the latter, because at the end of the day, a good story is a good story, whether it is more or less believable, right? A writer (Jude Law) begins this tale, telling us how in his young days, he stayed in the decadent ""Grand Budapest Hotel"", and met the owner, Mr. Mustapha (F. Murray Abraham), who will tell him how he acquired the hotel, back in the glorious days.",

I feel like this could only be called a ''little brother'' of a movie,strange as it may sound. In retrospect,I can see myself watching it with a hot cup of tea (or coffee),on a rainy day,wearing a big woolly jumper,all wrapped up in my favorite blanket. Of course,none of the mentioned was actually put into action. None the less,this picture is such a treat. Similar to Agatha's 'Courtesan au Chocolat',it is a beautifully decorated piece of perfection,hiding a chocolate surprise on the inside,and packed in a pretty pink box with a signature blue ribbon. A few things come to mind with such a grand slice of cinematography; the guests(ranging from somewhat sane to completely cuckoo),Mr. Gustave's polished black shoes,and of course - pink. Pastel pink everywhere. I also take a liking to the hints of awkwardness that arise,as well as the tension in the air between the characters,so thick you could cut it with a butter knife. Or perhaps,the 'Throat Slitter'... It is clear,from the very beginning of the movie,that everything had to be done perfectly,or the magic of this divine hotel would be lost. A tiny slip up is all it would take for us to lose the smile that'd been lingering on our faces through the whole film. I can say,with out a doubt,much like the painting 'Boy with Apple',this quirky movie is a masterpiece!",

The Grand Budapest Hotel is Andersons little project here and one that is hugely entertaining as well, mixing humour with wit and love with surrealism, this movie truly contains a lot of different things. The story is about Gustave H a hotel manager of the place in the title, but it is not through his eyes we see the story no, it is F. Murray Abraham well no it is the character of Zero Moustafa a small hotel concierge who is hired by Gustave and quickly rises up to be a star player in the running of the hotel. The plot throws in twists and turns, characters that only Anderson could make up and at one point a shoot-out between a group of people who have no idea who they are shooting(sounds pretty mixed up right). The one thing that stops this being pretentious or anything along those lines is that it is funny, thoughtful but also just generally made up well, it never tries to make you think ""Oh cool"" but you can at times feel that, but it doesn't feel forced.",

Gustave is in jail. It's well written. In the end, the most interesting part of the film is the cast. Every member of it is good, and a lot of them are really great.

His style of humor ranges from being strange and shocking, off-colored and off the wall, to intelligent and witty. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" takes this trio of humor and blends them into a masterpiece of comic cinema. The story is so simple that I can write a book about it. It's central figure, a Lobby boy at the Grand Budapest Hotel, tells his story about the concierge Gustave H and the adventures he shared with him. These include but are not limited to murder, creepy assassins, prison escapes, ski chases, war, an all out shootout, a girl with a Port wine stain that is shaped like Mexico, and a painting of a Boy with an Apple. One funny scenario after another happens with these two characters as they carry out their journey. Many gags are thrown in just for laughs while others require more thinking, specifically the reoccurring spoofs on past cinema genres. Aspect ratios change through out the film, key lights turn on off, a blade is referred to as ""the throat slitter,"" and even Adrian Brody walks in slow-motion after a potential victim with a tensed-filled soundtrack.

At first, when watching Grand Budapest, It was Visually appealing and indeed Anderson may have missed his true calling as a premiere interior designer for the European aristocracy, as each scene is set up perfectly. My problem with the movie, and all Andersons movie's post Rushmore for that matter, is you don't really walk away from the films having gained anything as far as insight into life, or rewarding feeling you may have after let's say watching Woody Allen's ""Blue Jasmine"" which was layered. Sure, GBH was pretty to look at, and it is fun to see all the great actors (mostly used as props in the same way the villains 1932 Sara lea motorcycle was used) but when leaving the theater this time I felt a bit sick after, and I'm not sure it was completely the fault of eating the large bag of candy and sugary soda, in fact I felt more sick than I usually do after leaving the theater.",

Everything from the dialogue to the amazingly unique shooting techniques have been carefully thought out and refined to create this comedic and heart felt film. The acting performances were all very distinct and all very well portrayed by the actors. The standout performances being Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori, one putting in one of the better performances of his career and the other making himself known to the world with this amazing debut to film. This film had a very different and specific style of humor that is not typically used in modern comedies. This both helped to film but i think also slightly hurt it. It did take a little while to understand the humor the director was going for, but once i did it became more clear how it was being used with the overall plot. The plot was an interesting one that takes you back through time and doesn't spend too long in a single location, which really helps to move the film along quickly and provide a variety of scenery. In the end it is the directing techniques used by Wes Anderson that really make this film shine. - 8.3",
173,13 March 2014,MOscarbradley,8, A delightfully absurd Ruritanian romance from Wes Anderson,"Wes Anderson makes films that aren't like the films of anyone else. That may or may not be a good thing, depending on whether you 'get' them. I've always felt his films were like live action versions of the cartoons in 'The New Yorker'; sometimes they're funny, most of the time they're clever and always they seem to be designed for the intelligentsia. Perhaps that's why Wes Anderson's films don't make lots of money or win Oscars. Even the 'intellectual' New York comedies of Woody Allen have a wider appeal, not that their films have a great deal in common except, perhaps, their 'smartness'. Although ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" has secured a multiplex release I doubt if it will wow them in Des Moines which is a pity since this is a film of considerable charm and a good deal of wit. OK, it's hardly laugh-out-loud funny but I had a silly grin on my face from start to finish. Like all his films it's set in what we might call 'Andersonland', a totally fabricated country made up of scraps from his favourite fiction, in this case the writings of Stefan Zweig who gets a special dedication at the end. It's literary in that words matter a great deal and play an important part in the development of the story and it's a film in which stories are crucial, (it's divided, like a novel, into chapters). Indeed, the story that makes up the body of the film is told as a story within a story begun by elderly author Tom Wilkinson informing us of how he first met the owner of the The Grand Budapest Hotel many years before when we was a young writer, (played by Jude Law), and the owner was an old man, (an excellent F Murray Abraham), who in turn tells the story of when he was a mere lobby boy, (newcomer Tony Revolori), under the tutelage of the hotel's concierge and the films central character, M Gustave, (a superb comic performance from Ralph Fiennes). It's when we get back to this point in time that the dimensions of the screen change from today's customary widescreen to the box-like dimensions of '30's cinema. It's as if Anderson is paying tribute, not just to writers like Zweig, but to film-makers like Ernst Lubitsch as this is a Ruritanian romance set in the kind of Mitteleuropa so beloved of Lubitsch and others of the period. All it lacks are the characters periodically bursting into song. If the film doesn't quite live up to its predecessors such as ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" or ""The Life Aquatic"" I think it's because there's no emotional commitment to the characters, It's too skittish, too self- consciously smart to draw us in. On the other hand it looks amazing. The hotel itself is like a giant cake that the baker in the film, M Mendl, might have made, and then there's always that extraordinary cast to keep us entertained. The film reads like a Who's Who, not just of Anderson regulars, but of moviedom's best character actors. None of them are, of course, remotely 'realistic', not even Fiennes. They remain the stock characters we find in those 'New Yorker' cartoons but they remain good company nevertheless. One thing is guaranteed, of course; you won't find anything else like it, at least not until Anderson makes his next movie.",

Jumps in timeline was also expected as this one goes from 1985 to 1968 to much of the '30s. Most of the story concerns a character played by Ralph Finnes and his servant I'll refer to as Lobby Boy. I was quite amused by some of the lines and scenes and so was my mom who only asked a few questions about what was going on though she figured most of it out without my having to answer much of the time.

It has a sense of mystery found in movies from 60s and 70s, complete with delightful foreign names and a quirky mystery. Despite all this, there is also something so pure and true behind the film, it tells the story and journey of men. While not always glamorous, these special men remains loyal to themselves and their beliefs, and this is what coats the entire movie into the masterpiece that it is.

181,9 March 2021,Morejambo54,8, An excellent parody of classical film!,"By far the best part of this movie is the way it is filmed, every shot is deliberately placed to draw the audience and make it more believable of the set time period. The colours are bright and bold and bring the movie to life while still managing to create dark scenes. The comedy is excellent, it is one of the few occasions where visual comedy is used a lot and it works brilliantly. For those that don't know, visual comedy is when something funny is shown instead of simply telling the audience something, it works far better but is much harder to achieve. The acting is nothing to scoff at either. There are some big names in this movie, most of them having very small parts, it was a very risky move but I feel has worked in favour for the movie. The use of physical miniature models for the chase scene and others further emphasises the time setting but is also so deliberately and obviously fake that it becomes hilarious. The plot is alright and creates for some funny turns, the pacing is generally quite fast for the movie which can affect it in a perhaps negative way...I'm not sure how I feel about that yet. Some of the dialogue I found to be quite hard to follow due to the ostentatious language used by the upper-class individuals.

192,13 February 2015,ahegde3149,8, Remarkably thoughtful and wonderful,The Grand Budapest Hotel has many dark depressing themes under its colorfully cute and fun moments. With a variety of characters and a peculiar script Wes Anderson is able to grab your attention from the very first minute. The story is set in fictional country of Zubrowka in 1930s. We hear the tale of how Zero Mustafa (Toni Revolori) the lobby boy of the prestigious 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' ends up becoming the owner of the same. He becomes a good friend of the hotel's concierge Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). But things take a turn when someone close to M. Gustave dies and he is arrested suspecting of murder. Zero and Gustave embark on a journey to prove the innocence of M. Gustave where they become even closer friends. Ralph Fiennes has given a fine performance and definitely one of the most under-rated actors. We also have Edward Norton in a relatively smaller role and a exciting Bill Murray cameo as well.,

Since then, most of his films have left me unimpressed or disappointed. He has resorted to quirkiness and deadpan dialog increasingly. While I found ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" at least watchable, as was ""Rushmore"", (though neither worth recommending), ""Moonrise Kingdom"" and now ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" are examples of a director who is so consumed with his style, that the story takes a back seat. All the dialog sounds like it came from the same person. As others have noted, like the naked emperor, Anderson wants you to notice how cute he can be, with centered shots that have characters emerging from a hole one at a time from each of four 90 degree angles. Ha Ha Ha! But despite this being a comedy of sorts, laughs from the audience I was in were few and far between. I gave the film 2 stars, mainly because the sets were so pretty to look at, but like this film and Moonrise Kingdom, they were simply facades, with little substance beyond the surface appearance.",

Unfortunately, the characters are two-dimensional, the plot is silly at best, and even the cinematography is frequently cartoonish. There were whole scenes that were amateurishly animated. Many lines that I think were supposed to be shocking just came off dumb. Having funny stuff going on in the background can be a great device when used with skill, such as in Police Squad or even Mad Magazine, but then the background stuff has to actually be funny.

I've also seen most of Wes Anderson's other feature films, but they didn't engage me anywhere near as much as those three. Grand Budapest, unfortunately, is another also-ran. It seems more like a cartoon than a story about people. It presents caricatures instead of characters and make-believe instead of history. I do enjoy stylized films and TV, but extreme artificiality only works for me if it plays off something honest and real. Grand Budapest, however, is a cold and mechanical film: a caper of sorts, with a surfeit of chase scenes and narrow escapes. It might have been a ballet danced by wind-up toys. Although we glimpse dozens of beloved stars flitting across the screen, the effect is more like celebrities voicing animated images than an ensemble cast bringing events to life. (At least it wasn't in 3D!) I'd like to see the talented Mr. Anderson return to making movies about actual breathing people. Presenting misfits struggling to find their place in the world is what he's always done best. Maybe the idea of Grand Budapest started out that way, but that's not where it ended up.",

This is a colourful comic epic about the history of this European hotel. It is narrated over dinner by Zero, a former lobby boy informing an author how he came to own the hotel. Anderson highlights the film with a large ensemble cast entering in and out throughout the colourful sets and quirky camera shots. Ralph Fiennes plays owner Gustave who is framed for a murder. The victim is Madame D whom he flirted with and whom he learns left a painting to him in her will. This enrages her family who viewed the valuable painting as something that should have been left to them. Instead Gustave and Zero steal the painting and conceal it in the hotel safe. Fiennes leads the cast with pencil moustache and a hit on his life after escaping prison to clear his name. Tony Revolori plays the loyal Zero who benefits for his protective loyalty to Gustave. Adrien Brody plays Madame D's enraged son Dmitri who wants Gustave dead. Saoirse Ronan plays Agatha, a pastry chef at the Grand Budapest and who marries Zero. She also demonstrates bravery when it factors into transporting the painting when Dmitri comes looking. Edward Norton plays an inspector who first comes into the film on the train to the funeral. He eventually ends up hunting for Gustave. This is a grand scale mystery and comedy about loyalty and those individuals who make an impact along the way. Score: 10 / 10",

The only bothering CGI sequence was the ski chase, not that it was bad, but the CGI imagery which was used felt out of place, considering the humor in the rest of the film. The film is reportedly based on Stefan Zweig, who, like director Wes Anderson, has written stories full of eccentric characters. It begins with narrator Tom Wilkinson/Jude Law, who, going back to the past, refers the story to another narrator, old Zero Moustafa (J. Murray Abraham), who recalls his adventures as a young Tintin, in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka, in 1932. It was the last year before the ominous Nazi regime took power.

From the Easter egg candy colored hotel with delightful columns, a grand stair-step tram to raise visitors to the heights of the hotel's entrance, delightful hotel staff costumes and villains costumed in traditional black, this Wes Anderson did give this viewer one arena of entertainment that the rest, acting, story (what story?), plot (what plot?), characterizations (who cared about any of them?) lacked.

His set-pieces brim with colour and detail, yes, but his most obvious stylistic abnormality resides in the presentation of his bijou quirks to the audience. Instead of intensely revealing all that is going on in a scene with a single brutally long tracking shot - a la Inarritu -- Anderson opts instead for the short and sweet, a usually center-framed ground- level shot with a large depth of field that moves only on a rail, pivot, or gratuitous zoom.

The story is plain boring with with no emotional or mystery factor to encourage audience to watch it without getting bored till the end. Character development is crude and senseless. Cinematography is cheesy at best and there are insanely stupid mistakes/deficiencies in production such as English writing on everything even the temporary passport instead of German or Magyar! Seriously! LOBBY BOY???? Was it a movie or Pink Panther cartoon? Or maybe they taught the audience is illiterate and stupid! Young Mr Moustafa is very dark. Old Mr Moustafa is white! Hair gets grey by age but the skin only gets darker not whiter! The story is supposed to happen in year 1930 something. The Austria-Hungry empire has been collapsed for 15 years and yet in Captain Henckel's office (The police chief) we see the picture of emperor Franz Joseph of Habsburg dynasty and numerous other mistakes and deficiencies. I wonder how they managed to lure all these big names into an insanely stupid movie like this? And also I have zero ability to understand why critics acclaimed this movie.

There may be some bias there, but I find this, along with most of his other films, to be desperately trying to catch and keep the viewer's attention with rapidly changing colors, plots, and characters. This greatly detracts from what could have been a very funny movie. It strikes me as something made for the ADHD people of the world, making sure something is constantly distracting the viewer.

For this type of thing to work everything has to be 100% great. Most of the previous productions were OK and a person could sit there and enjoy playing make pretend, but to realize such a peculiar individual vision everything must be spot on. In Grand Budapest Hotel there seem to have been no holds barred and it's obvious that a greater than usual amount of effort went into its realization.

240,21 January 2015,davidjanuzbrown,1, Awful,"This is a film that deserves zero stars ( one reason being it has one of the biggest wastes of talent in Motion Picture History ( Finnes, Murray, Law etc)). It also reached a stage of Political Correctness that I have never seen before ( the bad guys are Nazi's are they afraid to offend Germans?). It also has the dubious distinction of being one of the very few movies that I do not get the point of (especially the scene in the Hotel with Jeff Goldblum where you have no idea what happens to that character?). Did I forget to mention that it was supposed to be a comedy? It forget to include laughs. Even Satire and 'Chick Flick' Romantic Comedies have at least one laugh. The repeat gag ( about the chocolate) was not funny the first time ( let alone the second). Basically it is awful and unless your brain works in a different way then most of us ( me included), you should avoid. Maybe that is why it was nominated for Oscars ( because Hollyweird does not think like the rest of us). Zero Stars.",
241,31 July 2015,lampic,10, Loved it,"The first thing that struck me with ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" is how much it reminded me on quirky ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain"" (2001) which I loved back than and always will. No one usually talks much about it but I see traces of ""Amélie"" very often here and there, the narrative, voice-over and all. Apparently this director is already known for his highly recognizable visual style and equally criticized and loved for it - I for one, love it and not only that I ""get it"", I actually wallow in every meticulously pre-arranged scene that makes movie look like some overblown marzipan cake it would probably take me several re-viewing to grasp all the countless little details. So what is here not to be liked? I really wonder - since it delighted me so much - who are those people who snicker and dislike what I find to be unforgettable joy of a movie? Could it be they are so used to familiar action/crime/murder clichés that they wont accept anything that is not fitting into boxes? That Wes Anderson (who, by the way was born in the same year as me, and uses my beloved Stefan Zweig as reference) is too creative and original for them? Contrary to these opinions, I am so relieved, glad and yes, thrilled that there are still directors around who love what they do and follow their own muse instead of making just another forgettable products on the factory line - ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" might seem odd to some, but to me it stands head and shoulders above anything that I see advertised these days.",

250,25 December 2015,stanrogersmith,3, Anderson Needs a New Recipe,"So, I've been meaning to watch TGBH for a while now, and finally got around to it. I knew it would be visually appealing and figured there would be some good chuckles as well. However, I didn't find anything worth laughing at, nor even chuckling at. It seems Anderson just phoned this one in and relied on his name for the accolades and praise he received from his army of pretentious and elitist sycophants. I think he really needs to learn what this means: A little can go a long way. He could have reduced the dialog by half and nothing critical would have been missed. And the vulgar language could have been omitted altogether without losing anything. Swearing just for the sake of swearing isn't ""edgy"". Its embarrassing. The one scene (and I'm sure there are many more if I really reflect upon it) that went beyond verbose with its ridiculous dialog was when Fiennes was berating the bell boy just after the prison escape. That exchange/rant went on for like two or three minutes and was just stupid. I mean, garbage like that - did Anderson really believe that when Fiennes apologizes afterwards in the manner that he did, that the audience is meant to find that funny? Got news for ya Wes - it wasn't. Something tells me Anderson has surrounded himself with a bunch of ""yes men"" who will tell the emperor how fantastic everything is. And at this point I'm sure Anderson now believes all the bull blown up his behind and has an ego to rival any top professional athlete's. Now, I understand that directors have a pool of actors that they like working with, and vice versa. However, it really is time for Wes to consider other actors. Does Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Schwartzman, Goldblum, have to be in every one of his movies??? And especially Schwartzman! That guy really rubs me the wrong way and I do not find him funny nor charming in the least. How he's able to sustain a career as an actor should be one of the modern day wonders of the world. But I digress, back to Anderson and his battalion of actors - its like he's got a checklist going and every time he cameos one of his ""regulars"", he marks it off. Wes, for the love of God, get some new blood in there. And as for his legions of brown-nosers and their ""Anderson is God / Can do no wrong"" devotion - look up the phrase ""Self- fulfilling Prophecy"". None of these pretentious blow hards would ever admit, under threat of torture, that they just wasted 2 hours and $10 on this movie. All I know is that I'm certainly glad that I didn't blow $10 or more watching this in a theater. And I'm sure the art/coffee house types will dismiss me as being a cretin who doesn't ""get it"" when it comes to this movie. However I'm sure that deep down they really know that this was sub-par at best.",
251,24 July 2014,Nothinggrandproductions,7, Visual stunning in every single way but lacks emotional resonance,"I have a love and hate relationship when it comes to Wes Anderson films. Some of his movies come across as absolutely incredible to me (Moonrise Kingdom and Fantastic Mr. Fox) and others are mostly forgettable (Bottle Rocket and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou), that being said, I haven't actually seen all of his movies but I had to watch The Grand Budapest Hotel since it has been helmed as one of the best movies of the year. And is it the best movie of the year? No, not really. Is it pretty good though? Absolutely. The movie doesn't stray away from Wes Anderson's style whatsoever and every single shot of the movie is absolutely incredible to look at. Listen, I don't think too many people complain about how great looking a Wes Anderson movie is. They are always absolutely gorgeous from the way the camera moves to the way each shot is framed to the color palette, everything is incredible as per usual and I think Budapest is probably his most beautiful film to date. My issues with Budapest more so come from the characters lacking real depth or emotional resonance as well as how overstuffed the movie is. ",

Beautifully told story, it is so amazingly beautiful. M.Gustav is the most wonderful eccentric concierge.

Like many other Wes Anderson movies, the film is very original, with a punchy script that is funny throughout. The sets were amazing, along with the different costumes and the whole look of the strange and mysterious hotel. It's one of those movies were you will see something new every time that you watch it because of the attention to detail and the many different characters who have there own individual backgrounds. In all, it's a movie not to miss, but you do have to have a certain sense of humour to enjoy it. Brilliant!",
258,16 July 2014,l_rawjalaurence,9, Wryly Humorous Evocation of a Bygone Era,"THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is one of the best films I have seen in recent times. On the surface it is a comedy stuffed full of brilliant one-liners: Ralph Fiennes, as the concierge M. Gustave, gets the chance to play comedy, something he actually does very well. The plot is a picaresque combination of the absurd and the entertaining; I particularly enjoyed the prison-break sequence through the sewers, spearheaded by chief convict Ludwig (Harvey Keitel), and the climactic sequence where Gustave and his sworn enemy Dımitri (Adrien Brody) become involved in a shooting-match in the hotel, where everyone seems to be firing at everyone else with no real sense of purpose. Yet Wes Anderson's film is also an elegy for a vanished way of life; that bourgeois European world of dowagers and countesses, whose indiscretions would be carefully hidden from public view by discreet concierges like Gustave. The settings are quite breathtaking in their grandioseness; the Budapest hotel, with its profusion of exterior windows and restrained pink interiors, the dining-room covered with a blood-red carpet, and the lobby full of pillars, evokes a world of opulence and style. Together with cinematographer Robert Yeoman, Anderson evokes a world of precise geometric shapes - the rectangular pillars set against the rhombuses of the troops; the precise arches of the door-frames and the exquisitely placed dining-tables, turning the hotel dining-room into something resembling an examination hall in a school. The impression communicated is one of a world precisely ordered, both architecturally and socially - which is completely destroyed by military interventions. When the young writer (Jude Law) visits the hotel much later, and encounters the elderly Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), the building is on its last legs, a remnant of a vanished world. Hence the film's last sequences assume a poignant tone, especially when we learn what happened to Gustave. Based on material by the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig (1881-1942), who was forced out of Germany on Adolf Hitler's coming to power, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is an elegy for a world blown apart by military invention. Highly recommended.",

261,8 July 2014,BeneCumb,8, Recognizable Wes Anderson - nevertheless catchy,"Anderson likes to play both with characters and actors, and the result is a peculiar yet distinctive movie without ""normal"" persons. However, by no means, they are comedies, but rather dramas with comic elements; the same applies to The Grand Budapest Hotel where you can't have big laughs, but there are various opportunities for giggling and snorts. After all, background events and fates of characters are mainly dramatic. But joyful colors, symmetry admiration, the English language in the German surroundings, and lots of poker-faced characters provide the movie a surreal visual. ",
262,5 June 2014,drqshadow-reviews,8," Idiosyncratic, Endearing and Clever, It's Anderson Through-and-Through","At this point I think we're pretty well beyond hope that Wes Anderson will ever try a different style of filmmaking, and for that I wish more power to him. Even the stop-motion children's film The Fantastic Mr. Fox, despite its literary origins, is indisputably Anderson from start to finish. So, in lieu of a proper evolution, perhaps the best one can hope for is for Mr. Anderson to make the perfect Wes Anderson movie. The Grand Budapest Hotel falls quite close to that ideal. Thoroughly quirky, lovingly composed with a strict eye for heavy detail, funny and dense and sweet and genuine; it's everything I love about his pictures, draped over the skeleton of a different tale. The man certainly has his favorites - recurring actors from earlier in his career appear in the dozens throughout this one - but you'll smile and applaud their arrival, one by one, like traveling players in a variety of elaborate costumes and characters. Ralph Fiennes is magnificent as the leading man, a silky-smooth, primped, proper, profane concierge with a knack for elderly women and a ferocious wit. His understudy, lobby boy Anthony Quinonez, is the film's anchor: a particularly straight, self-assured young lead who's cut from the same cloth as Rushmore's Max Fischer. Richly funny, otherworldy in its beauty, quick and sharp as a tack, it goes a bit overboard in the third act but that's all in the name of good fun.",

267,12 June 2022,aidanratesmovies,9, Excellent and exhuberent,"Busting with charm and Anderson's whimsical direction- The Grand Budapest Hotel proves to be another hilarious and delightfully odd adventure into the mind of one of my favorite directors. I would say the main flaw of this film, if there are any, is that it doesn't quite ever take its story to the next level. It seems to stroll along the same sort of pace and tone without any true twists and turns along the way- or at least nothing that makes it feel so dire. However, this is also where a lot of the charm comes into play. Ralph Fiennes character is absolutely brilliant in this film, and his performance is magnificent- a charmer of stature and sorts flipped on his head and yet somehow you still care so much and seem to respect him as much as well- as if truly viewing the film through the eyes of the narrator. The rest of the cast is also great of course, Anderson's films ensemble are nothing but perfection as always, and his casting is impeccable. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic- perhaps my favorite of his films thus far- and the costume design is exquisite. Although I did enjoy films like Moonrise Kingdom or The French Dispatch a tad more- The Grand Budapest Hotel is a delightfully melancholic adventure that is as easy to watch as a film can be.",

I remember in the cinema it was only me and a friend that went to watch it and I left thinking that it was underrated and that it deserved so much more recognition. It was this film that got me into some of Wes Anderson's other movies and soon I became a fan of his films. I definitely would say he's one of my favourite directors. Anyway, this film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is about Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes) who is a hotel concierge and his lobby boy, Zero (Tony Revolori) and after one of Gustave's mistresses passes away, he becomes a suspect and he and Zero are forced to run away and are lead on a very grand adventure.

The cast is amazingly large and popular and almost every single character has at least one good moment/ line to shine. This movie is fast paced going from location to location, each more different than the last. The dialog reflects the rest of the movie as funny, quirky and memorable. Everything in this film is perfect. From the intentionally detailed scenes to the quirky symmetrical camera angles, everything gives the film an innocent dreamlike quality that few films even hope to achieve.

In the opening scene, we see a young girl visiting the cemetery where the Author is honored, and, as she reads one of his works, the Author begins to tell directly to us about how he happened to encounter its inspiration when he was younger during the late 1960s. During his trip in some eastern European country named Zubrowka(it is a fictional one, of course), the Author(played by Jude Law at this point) spent several days in the Grand Budapest Hotel, which was not so impressive to him in many aspects at that time.

It's a film that should be seen, fan of Art House movies or not. He produced an 18-page script with longtime collaborator Hugo Guinness in 2006, they imagined a fragmented tale of a character inspired by a mutual friend, based in modern France and the United Kingdom. Years later with lots of research in various forms.

There's nothing quite like it. It's a tangible and twee little tale that constantly subverts expectation. It's often incredibly funny (a moment in a monastery is straight-up side-splitting) and it remains good-humoured from start to finish.

287,14 January 2015,DisinterestedWisdom,5, A Sugary Confection,"It's a film that defies analysis, because frankly, there's no real meaning behind it. It's a bit of a sugary confection, with a very thin story and wholly unbelievable scenes, sets and characters. It's not quite interesting enough for fantasy, but it is probably well classified within that genre; absurdist fantasy. It departs from other absurdist films by this director in being quite untethered to any plausible reality, making it not quite nearly as compelling as some of his other, in my view, better films. Ralph Fiennes as a disappearing species in a disappearing milieu would be interesting if the film weren't so completely farcical. And so you have a kind of cartoonish mystery balancing on completely impossible and implausible scenarios carried out by mostly nonsensical characters, giving this film all the depth of a comic book. It's simply impossible to give a crap about any of it. The pastel-rich pastiche only adds to the sensation of being afloat in a sea of cake frosting. Not a great success, in my view, and hardly interesting enough, frankly, to have kept my attention from wandering.",

289,4 August 2014,JohnLeeT,10, Intellectually Stimulating Zweig Cinema Magic,"A visionary director of obvious intelligence has taken a screenplay of gold in hand and created a stunning, literate, lovely motion picture for those of us who seek the intellectually stimulating in cinema choices. When it was announced that the wonderful author Stefan Zweig was the inspiration for this film, we were incredulous but tantalized. Upon experiencing this beautiful motion picture, we were speechless. It was thrilling to see Zweig's spirit embraced, alive on the screen and permeating celluloid. Superbly directed by Anderson with characters brought to life by a cast of great actors, especially Ralph Fiennes and F. Murray Abraham ( a delight to see Abraham indeed!), the proceedings are amazingly Stefan Zweig cinematically realized at times. The wit, the quirkiness, the satire is all there, yet the dark cloud of future totalitarianism casts a shadow across laughing faces as a portent of things to come. The tragic cataclysm of fascism in 1930's Europe is seldom far from our thoughts as we watch the incredibly photographed, fairytale landscapes before us. This is simply a wondrously made movie, set in a mythical country that is virtually Oz-like in appearance. The humor is broad and almost slapstick in sequences but there is something much darker beneath all of it and a certain overall uneasiness experienced by audiences. Without doubt one of the very, very few films of the last decade that truly deserves our unreserved acclaim. It is certainly director Anderson's most accomplished and meaningful work and our admiration for him is now quite intense, to be sure. He has honored Stefan Zweig most appropriately and deliciously, surely inspiring a renewed appreciation and even rediscovery of Zweig and that is the real triumph of this quite intellectual piece of cinema magic.",

I used to take the angry and critical comments about Oscar-nominated or -awarded movies with a grain of salt, since I could see some value in many nominated movies in the past.

299,24 January 2015,charmadu,2, Glad I Didn't Pay for This,"Before I start, let me say I enjoyed The Royal Tenenbaums, so I didn't have any prior negative feelings about this director. When I heard how many awards this latest film was up for, and that the local library was having a free showing, I high-tailed it down. Wow -what a disappointment!I found this film depressing on many levels. The word that comes to mind is COWARDICE, fluffed up with CGI artifice. For starters, there were so many opportunities with the material that included issues of race, culture, class, sexual orientation, aging, war, etc. ALL of them missed! All of them treated with the same shallow-as-a-birdbath approach. I truly felt sorry for every actress in this film. They were all either grotesque gargoyles or saintly and scarred like Agatha. If you were to take all the lines collectively from every actress in this film, I've no doubt they'd easily fit on 1/2 sheet of paper. The ratio of women to men was worse than a Saturday Night Live cast list. That said, there was more genuine life in Tilda Swinton's 20 seconds than in the entire rest of the film! This was a new low for LOW emotion fans. The director was too timid to even penetrate the heavily perfumed facade of his main character. In the scene where he's been sprung from prison and is vomiting a racist diatribe on his underling's head, the latter responds by saying how war forced him to leave his country, after his family and town were destroyed. Suddenly Zero is a ""refugee"" and that magically causes Gustave to apologize profusely to him. Voilà! Zero becomes a Hero and aren't we glad we don't have to think about such nasty deep seated beliefs ever again! Similarly, the director appeared to have been too afraid to even use a real Nazi symbol in the hotel, instead going for some pseudo Art Deco/Fascist Lite look. Yes, some of the set design and outdoor CGI scenes were nice to look at but not for that long. I must have looked at my watch 7-8 times. Thankfully I saw it for free - I only regret I paid for parking!",

305,19 February 2019,isaacj02,9," Slick, stylish and ferociously funny","Wes Anderson is perhaps one of the most delightfully unusual filmmakers working today, his films characterised by picturesque symmetry, wry humour and more than a hint of the macabre. The Grand Budapest Hotel is no different and actually stands as one of Anderson's finest films; it's precisely choreographed, gorgeous to look at and, above all, an intelligent comedy that pays homage to bygone cinema whilst adding its own unique spin.
Though the action may jump time periods (whether it's from Tom Wilkinson's direct narrator or F. Murray Abraham's narrator within the story), it centres around The Grand Budapest Hotel, an elite establishment for the rich and pampered in the fictional state of Zubrowka. Our attention is immediately turned to M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), the hotel's concierge, who tends to the guests with a managed slickness... that is when he isn't courting dowagers into his room. The film takes off on a race of storytelling, as Gustave is framed for the murder of an old lover (a prosthetic-clad Tilda Swinton) and must flee the law and who knows else with only the help of his protégé, lobby boy, Zero (a suitably boyish Tony Revelori, when not played 30 years down the line by a mellow F. Murray Abraham).
The film is a delightful farce, Anderson and Hugo Guiness' script providing intelligent and subtle comedy that delivers even amid such a frenetic and occasionally scatty pace. For the most part though, The Grand Budapest Hotel is as tightly wound as one could expect from Wes Anderson; even amid the absurdity of ski chases and severed fingers, there's a remarkable level of control to the madness, helped along by Anderson's assured writing and direction.
Employed in the cast is a who's who of star-studded spectacle; Ralph Fiennes, Willem Dafoe and Saoirse Ronan are plot-central, but around them are bit cameos from the likes of Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and Lea Seydoux. Fiennes leads with rapier-sharp timing as Gustave, his performance radiating clipped composure, all complete with an irresistible charm. The supporting cast are admittedly largely one-note (occasionally the abundance of celebrity proves a little distracting) but are earnest enough to drive the film through.
Where the film has perhaps received the highest praise, however, is its design. The Grand Budapest hotel is a visual treat, its design vibrant yet avowedly architected. There's almost a sense of the characters having been painted on screen; from the bright colours, sharp angles and miniature set pieces, the film feels as much a spectacle of art as an espionage romp. Alexandre Desplat's score is perfectly judged, the musical voice established by the distinct and innovative use of the balalaika. The film is shot with equal verve, snapping from camera ratios incessantly to produce an energised and unexpected cinematography that boosts the narrative. At points, the movie may be a case of style over substance, but the film's unusual design only seems to enhance one's enjoyment of it.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a strange film, a comedy full of black humour and gentlemanly profanity. Thoroughly entertaining and visually enchanting, this is certainly a gem from Wes Anderson.",

The Grand Budapest Hotel is perhaps a dramatic kind of postmodern parody of early 20th century old films, yet I can't see the appeal of why it is regarded as funny by it's admirers. The main character is a wealthy, flamboyant, hedonistic, bisexual bachelor and con-artist who we are supposed to be rooting for because, presumably, he's 'fun.' We are supposed to find his hedonistic antics and the fact he's had lots of lovers funny too, possibly because the people who do love this film are boring middle-class people are like imagining being in this role? Who knows. It is supposed to be funny that the Lobby boy, the typecasted deadpan sidekick, does all the preverbial heavy lifting due to his laughably diverse skill-sets. But it isn't funny. As the farcical series of pantomime-styled events unfolds, The Grand Budapest Hotel relies on wooden, stilted dialogue and various forms of mise-en-scene to generate some amusement from it's audience but it doesn't really work and comes across as stale, vapid and is infantile farce of a production.

313,2 October 2014,jboothmillard,7, The Grand Budapest Hotel,"I heard a good amount of this film during its release in the cinema, because of its director, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums, Fantastic Mr. Fox), and an impressive all-star cast, I didn't know much else besides that, but I was most keen to watch it. Basically, a memoir was written by a character known only as 'The Author' (Tom Wilkinson), it recalls his trip to the Grand Budapest Hotel in 1968, in the Republic of Zubrowka, a European alpine state damaged by war and poverty. The Young Writer (Jude Law) finds the remote mountainside hotel, it has fallen on hard times with glistening facilities in need of repair and fewer guests, the Writer encounters and in the evening has dinner with the elderly hotel owner Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), and he starts telling his tale of how he came to own the hotel and why he will not close it down. The story flashes back to 1932, during the glory days for the hotel, then young Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) was a lobby boy, in charge of the staff is devoted concierge Monsieur Gustave H. (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Ralph Fiennes), important messages from the unknown owner are relayed through lawyer Deputy Vilmos Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum). When not attending to needs of the hotel's wealthy clientèle or managing staff, Gustave courts numerous ageing women looking for ""exceptional service"", one of these ladies is Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) who he spends a night with before she leaves, one month later she dies in mysterious circumstances, at the wake her will reveals she bequeathed Gustave the very valuable painting Boy with Apple. This angers the family who wanted to inherit the painting, including the Madame D's son Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis (Adrien Brody) who lashes out, Gustave and Zero return to the Grand Budapest Hotel and the painting is locked away in the safe, Gustave makes a pact with Zero that for his help he will be his heir, and following this Gustave is arrested and imprisoned accused of murdering Madame D, after forced testimony by her butler Serge X (Quantum of Solace's Mathieu Amalric). To aid Gustave with his escape from the prison Zero has his fiancée Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) bake cakes to send, with stone working tools concealed inside, he and a group of convicts dig their way out of the cell, Gustave and his servant team together to prove his innocence, while cold-blooded assassin J. G. Jopling (Willem Dafoe), working for Dmitri, who kills Kovacs for refusing to work with Dmitri, also pursuing is investigating Inspector Henckels (Edward Norton). The adventure takes Gustave and Zero to a mountaintop monastery, the only person who can clear Gustave of the murder accusations is Serge, but before he can reveal the important information he is strangled by Jopling, the assassin is chased fleeing the monastery down the snowy mountain, they stop and there is a face-off at the cliff edge, Zero rescues Gustave and pushes Jopling to his death. Back at the Grand Budapest Hotel, an outbreak of war is imminent, the hotel has been commandeered by the military who are in the process of converting the hotel into a barracks, Gustave is heartbroken, Dmitri catches Agatha trying to retrieve the painting, chasing and gunfire ensues, until Gustave's innocence is proved by, the Madame D's second will is discovered, hidden behind the painting, she was the unknown owner, in it she leaves most of her fortune, the painting and the hotel to Gustave, he becomes a wealthy regular hotel guest, while Zero becomes the new concierge. Old Zero tells that on a train journey enemy soldiers inspecting papers took Gustave and shot him, Agatha died from influenza two years later, and he inherited the hotel and fortune Gustave promised him and he vows to continue the legacy of the Grand Budapest Hotel, he explains this is not loyalty to Gustave, it is his last remaining link to Agatha, and the Writer departs for South Africa and does not return. Also starring Harvey Keitel as Ludwig, Jason Schwartzman as Monsieur Jean, Bill Murray as Monsieur Ivan, Owen Wilson as Monsieur Chuck, Bob Balaban as Monsieur Martin, Short Circuit's Fisher Stevens as Monsieur Robin, Léa Seydoux as Clotilde and Hostages' Larry Pine as Mr. Mosher. Fiennes is the perfect choice for the most prominent character, I agree the likable newcomer Revolori is a little overshadowed by the big names, including Dafoe, Norton, Brody and Ronan who stand out in my memory, its choice of colouring for costumes and scenery is nice and vibrant, the eccentric characters add something to every scene, and the weird and wonderful story with a murder mystery and a charming hotel is interesting, an entertaining wild yarn comedy. It won the Oscars for Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Music, Original Score for Alexandre Desplat, and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it won the BAFTAs for Best Original Music, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay for Wes Anderson, and Best Make Up & Hair, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Sound, and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay.

He tries to clear his name with the help of the new lobby boy. It's Wes Anderson so obviously it's not that simple. Mixing violence, sex, swearing, comedy, visual dazzle, drama, developed characters, a murder mystery and loads of weird and wonderful set pieces into a whole, The Grand Budapest Hotel should have been terrible. But it works very well. The visuals are incredible: With the inventive colour palette and fascinating angles TGBH creates a world of its own. Although emphasis on such a visually amazing world inevitably makes it feel empty at times and there are a couple of dips, this is a very good piece of indie cinema and it should be nominated for best picture at the Oscars this year. As both writer and director, Wes Anderson does a good job; his direction is visually stunning, humorous, gleefully stylized and at times suspenseful while his script mixes all those elements with surprising ease.",

The plot elements are secondary and are only as the plate is to the wonderful dinner. The story of Old Europe passing away as the war rages all around, can only be told as the people who lived it are shown.

The story starts really slowly but had just enough detail and setting to keep me in my seat - at the 1 hour mark I wanted to leave. The sets are visually pleasing particularly the heavily wood panelled rooms and staircases of the buildings. The little models of the hotel are obviously that. The characters are bland as hell perhaps with the exception of the neurotic old lady near the beginning. The acting is deliberately very deadpan with some (correct?) idea that central Europeans are ultra reserved, uptight, solitary. The cameos are really annoying as they add absolutely nothing - no humour or intrigue. The script is wanting in the extreme and contains N. American language/swearing/syntax that is completely out of place in this film. The screen play needed desperately to be reworked a few more times with a twist or two to satisfy the audience. The audience - many older, seasoned movie veterans, sat in silence almost all of the time - two brave souls tried to applaud at the end but thought better of it. I had the impression this was an American film, with potential, that should have been handed over, in toto, to the Brits to make it much much better. In summary, it was a waste of $12 X 2.",

There is almost nothing wrong with this movie other than that it is too short and ends a bit too abruptly. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant in this movie, and it is truly a criminal offense that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Bradley Cooper, Micheal Keaton, and Eddie Redmayne should have never been nominated over Ralph Fiennes. The only performance that was better than Fiennes' in that year was Jake Gyllenhall's in Nightcrawler. But, Nightcrawler was definitely not as good a film as Grand Budapest.

He reads Stephan Zweig and makes a totally pretentious 'art-house' movie 'inspired' by a cursory reading of a few of Zweig's minor novellas. In his own imagination Max Fischer is a great director/playwright (and also master of calculus) but in the real world he is an industrious but dim-witted student whose grades are so low he fails to graduate from high-school. On a subject which he knows something about, which is documenting the torment of his daily life at Westchester High or describing the interactions of the members of his very odd family the level of writing/directing is what one might say juvenile (that is written by a juvenile, and in this case for a juvenile audience) but decent. Now, the young Mr Fischer with a few movies under his belt may well imagine (as he is prone to) that he is the next Dostoyevsky, but that does not make it so. Just as he might imagine himself to be the next Einstein of mathematics when in the real world his endeavours are failed by his 11'th grade math teacher, this work is equally woeful in respect of literature.

It was colorful, and had quite a few laughs, but that's about it. A lot of actors were quite simply under-used. Tilda Swinton had so little to do that a simple portrait of her would have sufficed.

364,21 April 2014,cultfilmfan,10, The Grand Budapest Hotel,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the most entertaining and fun times I have had at the movies so far this year. With an elaborate and all star cast, plus Wes Anderson's usual original and eccentric type screenplays and beautiful cinematography, music and a brilliant performance by Ralph Fiennes, make this film a definite must see at the theatre. The film has it's own unique look and style to it which is very pleasing to the eye as well as suiting the setting and tone of the film as well. The performances are all great here, but I have to single out, Ralph Fiennes, as our lead character M. Gustave. This is a character who is suave, classy, charming, funny and one of the most interesting characters I have seen in a film in quite awhile. Fiennes plays this character to sublime perfection and it is an absolute joy to watch this character and Fiennes portrayal of him on screen. Fiennes has been nominated for two Oscars before, but has never won and I sincerely hope that The Grand Budapest Hotel, will become his third nomination and maybe even first win. It was just such a lively and spirited performance and as I said both a joy and very entertaining to watch because of how well written the character is, plus Fiennes' top notch performance. The writing here by Wes Anderson, is brilliant as is most of his screenplays and while I have admired every film I have seen by him (Bottle Rocket is the only one left I have to see), I would say that The Grand Budapest Hotel is both is strongest and best film since 2001's The Royal Tenenbaums. Sometimes, I feel that some of his later films have a little more style to them than substance, and while I still have liked everything he has done, I think I still do prefer his earliest films such as Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums the best. While, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is certainly high on style from it's elaborate sets, costumes and makeup and while it is an absolutely gorgeous film to look at, I did not find the style overwhelmed the film, or took away from the story in any way. Some of his films I have had that criticism with to certain degrees, but here I think Anderson found the perfect balance of both style and substance. It has an absolutely wonderful screenplay full of fascinating and well written characters as well as a lot of action, adventure and humour along the way as well. Going along with this wonderful story is a lot of beautiful cinematography, sets and art and set decoration which further add to the film and give it an amazing look that seems relatively familiar to us, but at the same time, also like nothing we have ever seen before. I like how Anderson chose to do a period piece film and add elements of old cartoons and spy novels and movies to the film to further enhance the action, adventure and overall fun sense that the film carries with it from start to finish. I know that Wes Anderson's films are certainly a required taste and are definitely not for everybody. I have shown his films to people in the past and they didn't care for them at all and I have also read film reviewers who just never got his work, or understood the appeal people find with his films. Although while reading some reviews of The Grand Budapest Hotel, I did notice that some critics who usually did not care for Wes Anderson's work, that this time around they changed their minds and really embraced and found a lot to like with The Grand Budapest Hotel. Perhaps that is because in certain ways it is one of Anderson's most accessible films because of it's high energy and fast paced script and direction. Also, I would challenge almost anyone to sit through this film and not find it fun and entertaining. I think you would find few who would disagree. Still, I fear there will be some who just will not be able to get into the film finding it perhaps too quirky, or offbeat for their tastes, but at the same time for anyone who maybe has never liked Anderson's previous works, or are new to his body of work, I would say that The Grand Budapest Hotel is a great place to start. I hope that because of this film's release early in the year that it will not be shunned, or forgotten come next Oscars season. There is plenty the film could be nominated for such as Best Actor (Fiennes), Best Original Screenplay as well as cinematography, makeup, costume design and art direction. I think based on the excellent reviews the film is receiving that is still could be fresh in voters minds come next fall, or winter, so hopefully it does get some nominations and maybe even Anderson his first Oscar after three nominations and no wins. As for The Grand Budapest Hotel, it is simply sublime in every way possible and I laughed, was entertained and in a perpetual state of joy as I watched this wonderful piece of creativity and art. I had an absolute blast and I think many other viewers will as well, so if this film is playing anywhere near you, be sure to see it now because the theatre is the right place and atmosphere to do so. As it remains, The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the best films of 2014 so far.",

377,9 April 2014,matt-smithhart,9, One of the best Anderson films yet!,"The Grand Budapest Hotel, inspired by the works of Stefan Zweig and written by Wes Anderson hit United States theaters on March 28, 2014. The story falls between comedy and adventure and throws the audience into the plot within the first ten minutes. The movie works its way through the plot by presenting a recollection of stories from the owner of the famous Grand Budapest Hotel in the fictitious country of Zubrowka (unless you don't want it to be fictitious then it is real), and is perhaps (and will be in my opinion) one of the best movies of 2014. The movie consists of some very well known actors such as Jude Law, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Edward Norton, and the one and only Bill Murray. The movie is a non-stop comical adventure and leaves you attached to the characters from the get go. If you like the scoring of all of Wes Andersons usual movies then you will surely not be disappointed as the sound crew keeps the music similar to the other Anderson films. This movie is at a rating of 9/10 because although it was absolutely phenomenal, it wasn't a perfect movie. It was missing some sort of element that I can't seem to place my finger on. However, this movie made its way into my ""All Time Top Five Movie List"" and I will definitely purchase this movie on its Blu-Ray DVD release date.",

It's boring and a waste of time, and I regret even renting it from Netflix except that it gave me the opportunity to come up with my ""paint thinner"" line, which I am proud of.

I kind of thought he was a one trick pony. Maybe I was wrong because I actually enjoyed this one. Say what you want to about him, he is an auteur. He has a definite style all his own and he pulled out all the stops with this movie. I liked how a lot of the set were little models (It's only a model) and you could tell and he wanted you to be able to tell. He's not hiding any of this goofy stuff. There is an outrageous and absurd, but fun sled chase scene. Ralf Fiennes is one of my favorite actor after seeing him in this. He steals the show. He owns his part. It was interesting how they made Tilda Swinton really old. I didn't recognize her at first. Although the many famous actors that Anderson has come and go. I'm not even going to name them. It would be easier to name the actors not n this movie. The Muppets would be proud of the cameos and short parts. It's also incredibly colorful and pretty visual. I would kind of recommend to try to see it in the theater. Just a quick synopsis, it takes place right at the beginning of World War 2 in Budapest at a hotel, (of course) for the most part. It's actually kind of a story within a story within a story. It's about a friendship between a bellboy and a hotel manager who get accused of murdering an old rich guest he's been sleeping with at his hotel.",

Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) & Zero (Tony Revolori) lead us through an animated adventure involving stolen art work, hit men, a brazen prison break, human greed and - above all - revenge. Is it entertaining? Hardly. Funny? Not very! In fact, Anderson's film is full of horrible caricatures of Slavs, Sikhs, and silly visual clues and symbols (e.g. the dead cat, ""Guard Bunk Room"", the Society of Crossed Keys, to name a few). The ending is predictable and the acting is quite uneven (Cameo appearances by Tilda Swinton & Bill Murray do little to save this one from ignomy).

Like, for me, I want to say some of the comedy feels Marx Brothers inspired, sans Harpo, but then that isn't really right.

It was perfectly in line with Anderson's current cinematographic identity, with a visually perfect aesthetic, consistently vibrant colors and symmetrical balance in every shot. Having already seen a majority of the director, writer and producer's films, this was certainly one of his best. My only complaint with the film was the unusual use of gore, with which I believe the filmmaker was testing the waters. There were three brief, but alarmingly bloody and violent scenes, which did not exactly fit in with the style of the film or the director and were all-out unusual and unneeded. I hope that in his future films, Anderson omits this type of shock factor in the form of unnecessary gore.",

Milton Welsh (AEON FLUX, CONAN THE BARBARIAN) is on-screen for more scenes lasting longer than is Tom Wilkerson. However, most everybody else at my screening were gray-haired old farts approximately Wilkerson's age, as opposed to the Milton Welsh crowd, who are still in their reproductive years. Therefore, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL plasters Wilkerson on its poster to appeal to its target audience (folks with one foot in the grave), most of whom could not distinguish Welsh from their own great-grandchildren. THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is ALL about the past, with lines such as, ""His world vanished long before he ever entered it."" As Michael Bay once said, ""Those who can, transform the ""Now"" into Tomorrow. Those who cannot, make 'Art' films."" The best thing about THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is that it provides so many jobs for codgers. With every flick like this, it's likely to be one less plug for the Old Broke Actors' Poor House we'll be forced to sit through at the multiplex (and less social security gravy train dough stolen from today's teens).",

It is as flashy as a bad taste painting, but above all, it is as stiff as a compassed dandy. All the paintings in the film seem to be stuck in a mixture of starch and mothballs.

The language and names of places are a confusing mix of Polish and German. The obvious use of scale models of streets and buildings as well as the hotel itself is engaging and suits the square format very well. The story does its best to be everything it can be but is not the central focus of the film in my opinion.

Despite their usually roguish natures, these connections hint at some kind of deep sadness and longing beneath their charismatic facades. For them, these places are more than houses and boats and boarding schools—they represent something friendly and welcoming. They know that the world can be a cruel, cruel place and all they can really ask for from life is somewhere to call home—a sanctuary. For M.

Wes Anderson's style of filmmaking is probably my favourite, (along with Tarantino) because of his quirky characters, all of his story's are completely unique and hilarious with a pinch of drama. His pacing is so fast! The grand Budapest could have easily been over 2 hours because of it's complicated story but because Anderson's paving is so fast the film is only 100 Min's.

Different places while being dragged from place to place... I can't help but highlight the places. While watching the movie, I felt as if we were moving our lips a little and inhaling the smell emanating from the pages while reading a book, and as I said, this feeling reached its peak especially in the descriptions of the place.

Personally I love it, he is one of this generations best directors. That man is an artist. You can tell the amount of effort from, not just Wes but the cast as well, that went into every shot to make it as good as it can be. The soundtrack matches perfectly to the film and the humour is laugh-out-loud funny. The Grand Budapest Hotel is now one of my all time favourite films and I am proud to say so.

435,7 February 2015,lesleyharris30,9," Very Fun and Charming Film that Will Surely Stand the Test of Time,","The Grand Budapest Hotel is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding comedic cast.I haven't been a huge fan of some of the previous films I've seen by Wes Anderson,I understand that he is a very creative and unique film maker,but his directing style is just a little too weird for me,but it didn't bother me with this movie,it is just hilarious,looney and it never would have been this much fun had it not been for Wes Andersons very talented mind,it's certainly my favourite film I've seen from him to date and I will have to check out some more of his work.The cast is absolutely superb,with many of Andersons usual cast members as well as some new faces,but none of them manage to take the spotlight away from Ralph Fiennes,Mr Gustave is a very different character who I found absolutely charming,his dialogue was outstanding and I've never been so taken away by Fiennes as an actor before,certainly one of his finest characters and I couldn't imagine anyone else in this role,his dialogue with newcomer Tony Revolori was spectacular and one of the movies highlights,they worked together so well.I felt like the movie certainly could have been longer,it is very quick and fun which certainly wasn't an issue,but another forty minutes of this wouldn't have been a problem either.A very fun ride that never stops being interesting,there is certainly nothing like the Grand Budapest Hotel and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or adventure film.

437,8 April 2014,inkblot11,9," Grand in many ways, especially in sets and art direction, also very imaginative; misses ten stars by a small, small margin","In the country of Zubrowka, on the continent of Europe, a former lobby boy at the Grand Budapest Hotel, Zero (F. Murray Abraham as an older man, Tony Revolori as a young man) is telling his story to a famous writer (Jude Law and Tom Wilkinson at various ages). This inn, now fallen on hard times, was once a lavishly beautiful place of accommodation for the wealthy and famous. In truth, Zero's former boss at the establishment, Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) was one of the primary reasons for the GB's phenomenal success. This meticulous man courted the rich ladies and gents and met their every needs. But, perhaps, he did his job too well. One unhappy day, the supremely rich Madame D (Tilda Swinton) dies and leaves a valuable painting to M. Gustave. This sets off a ferocious row for the lady's family, especially for her eldest, nasty Dimitri (Adrien Brody). As M. Gustave and Zero ""lifted"" the painting after the funeral, Dimitri send his henchman, Joplin (Willen Dafoe) after anybody who stands in the way of the painting's recovery, including their loyal lawyer (Jeff Goldblum). M. Gustave is even thrown in prison for awhile but makes just the right sort of pals inside, ones who can spring him out with their smarts and bravado (including Harvey Keitel). But, even after this happenstance, M Gustave and Zero are chased, up mountains, through fields and down dark alleys. Helping them is Zero's girlfriend, Agatha (Saorsie Ronan), and a large group of fellow hotel workers. Could there even be a new will that might cut Dimitri out completely? Who will triumph in the end? This grand and amazing film is a treasure for those who long for films of imagination, cleverness, and courage. To be honest, GBH falls a bit short of ten stars but certainly merits nine. To begin, its scale is incredible, with a dream cast and a mountainous setting that is breathtaking. Among the cast, its hard to pick favorites, but Fiennes, Goldblum, Keitel, Brody and Dafoe were most impressive to me, as well as the youngster, Revolori. One could add that they had the most ""showy"" roles, while the rest did very well indeed in their quieter parts. Also, the art direction, costumes, script, story, and frenetic direction also score huge points for dazzle, even though they sometimes fall a wee whisker short. All in all, how can anyone who loves film really resist the chance to see this one? They don't make em like this much anymore!",

The lobby boy was particularly awful. There was absolutely nothing special or endearing about him wich would make me believe that the main character would get attached to him. Which actually seemed to had happened from one second to another and for no particular reason.

The one thing that sticks in your mind, when you watch this movie, is the direction of it. The story is more like a contemporary fairy tell for grown ups, a simple story with some humorous circumstances that makes you laugh with the drama of the characters and their odd choices. However, that can be easily forgotten. The direction though, is the main highlight of the film. It balances between a comedy and drama, with shots that can easily remind of the old silent movies, animating films and 3D blockbusters. The cast is one of the pros of the film also, however the slightly unknown Mustafa takes the interest off the big names. So, as it can be expected by those actors, the performances are great and not over the top, as they could have easily overdone it. So 6 out of 10, because if the script as powerful as the rest of the movie, it would have been a nine.",

452,30 October 2014,JosephPezzuto,8, Reel Look: 'The Grand Budapest Hotel',"""Keep your hands off my lobby boy!"" From the colorful yet quirky mind of Wes Anderson comes another triumph in the books for this original director/screenwriter. As lavish visual environments are put on display to explore deeply emotional ideas, Anderson also intertwines the pathos into unlocking true human sentimentality. Based on the 1944 memoir of Austrian playwright and journalist Stephan Zweig entitled The World of Yesterday, it was Anderson who cited it as the spark for his new film. Nonetheless, this English-language comedy-drama film starring Ralph Fiennes as a Shakespeare-spouting concierge who teams up with one of his employees, albeit only friend, to prove his innocence after he is framed for murder is engrossing and enjoyable indeed. Grossing $46 million dollars plus to date, Anderson's latest does not disappoint nay hinder from his trademark comedy, idiosyncratic characters (and some cameos from the Anderson regulars) and pastel-colored perfectionism, raising the bar to new heights yet again for himself and his audience.

It's a breath of fresh air to see a director take passion in the colour palette of a film and stylise it so. However, what happens to your actors when they can only walk either vertically or horizontally? It becomes flat. I get the overwhelming impression that Anderson has planned his scenes so much so that there is absolutely no spontaneity. I think this is probably the most frustrating film I have ever seen, mainly because of the amount of effort that has gone into it but the lack of exploration given to the actors over arches the entire production. It's close, but miles off at the same time. I literally had to turn it off half way through after the 100th symmetrical scene or a shot in profile / head on. What had happened to exploring the 3 dimension world the film is shot in. I actually feel like within 30 minutes his direction becomes lazy and he has forgotten what the emotion of film is all about. Incredible scenes are lost because of the direction being so caught up in its own aesthetic. It's almost like watching Pac man for 2 hours. Shame, obviously a great script.",

468,26 December 2014,InMyHonestOpinion,8, A fantastic original idea told in a surreal way,"Storyteller/Director Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou) without fail would be one of my favourite directors, his artistic eye for detail and storytelling has a life all of its own, he has a way to draw you in and keep you engaged even when there is really nothing happening, with his unique style of camera work and his absolutely gorgeous locations, he has a unique ability to reinvent colour so that his sets are a world within themselves and so inviting. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a tale within a tale within a tale, the film begins acknowledging that on the farthest eastern boundary of the Eastern continent: The former republic of Zubrowka once the seat of an Empire a young girl walks up to and stands in front of a monument covered in hotel keys and holders, she reaches into her pocket and adds her own. A plaque reads ""Author"" ""in honour of our National treasure, she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a book with ""The Grand Budapest Hotel written across its front, she then turns the book over to reveal a black and white picture of the ""Author"". The picture turns to colour and the Author begins narrating the story from behind his desk in 1985. He begins to tell the story of a hotel he once visited many years earlier in 1968 the hotel of course was The Grand Budapest. Set in a fictitious place the hotel stood in Alpine Alps somewhere in Europe. The young Author talks about how the once Grand Budapest hotel is now in a dire state, run down and looking a lot worse for wear. Whilst bathing he meets the current owner a mysterious and sad looking man, he soon learns this man is the current owner, he learns that he was once the richest man in the world who owned all the riches one could ever imagine. The owner invites the author to a meal and begins to tell his story. The owner agrees and begins to tell his tale of how he arrived and now owns the Grand Budapest Hotel. Flash back to 1932 and the owner now a young lobby boy begins the tale once more for the author he begins to fill the ears of the Author as he is whisked away to another time and into a life of murder, theft, love, sex, art and riches.. Visually this story is stunning, plot wise the story telling is masterful, the camera shots used are vibrant and gorgeous, the score is an absolute journey from begging to end, the humour is endless, a little dark in places but still very typical of Wes Anderson's style. At times it did run a little slow in places but not enough to take anything negative. The cast was huge, so many big well-known names and every one of them played their character perfectly. Ralph Fiennes (Clash of the Titans, The Hurt Locker) as Monsieur Gustave H, was brilliant darling so charismatic and lovable. Tony Revolori (very new to the movie world) as Young Zero Moustafa was also amazing as Gustave H right hand man. F. Murray Abraham (Scarface, Amadeus) as Old Zero Moustafa. Adrien Brody (The Pianist, King Kong) as the vile Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis, Willem Dafoe (The English Patient, Spider-Man) as J.G. Jopling Dmitri's right hand assassin. Jeff Goldblum (Jurassic Park, Independence Day) as Deputy Vilmos Kovacs, add to this already amazing ensemble Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel and a plethora of other very big names and you start to get an idea at how big this film really is. You would think having so many huge names could only equal bigger egos and a total mess, but it is the complete opposite. I loved The Grand Budapest Hotel it is unlike Wes Andersons other film in the sense that this one has much more of a plot which of course only helps. I would recommend this for anyone who can look beyond big bangs and actually enjoy a real film. If your idea of a great film is Die Hard or something else as crass and pointless I wouldn't bother because you actually need to be slightly intellectual to really enjoy this one. Better yet if you don't like films with subtitles stay away, not that this has any it'll just make you think more than you normally would like to.",

471,6 April 2014,meeza,8, No boos in this Wes Budapest creation!,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is more of the unique craftsmanship of Writer-Director Wes Anderson, which many Wild Wes Wes Lovers will adore. The movie stars Ralph Fiennes in an excellent performance as Hotel Concierge M. Gustave of the titular hotel. Gustave is a suave concierge with his ways of romancing geriatric women heiress who stay in his hotel. One of them would be Madame D, who dies and leaves Gustave a priceless painting in her will and testimony. Madame D's ferocious sons have another plan in mind to relinquish Gustave of the painting. Gustave confides in a young lobby boy named Zero, who saves Gustave out of many near brushes with death & disaster; maybe Anderson should have shown Gustave singing The FIxx 80's tune ""Saved by Zero"" in one of the film's scenes. As in any Wes cinematic offering, there is much quirkiness involved in the film's scenes and characters. But as much as I enjoyed the film's creative ways, I do not think ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" resides in the presidential suite of the greatest independent movie comedies of all-time even though it did have some elements of a first-class stay; which included Fiennes' grand work as Gustave, and other grand thespian works coming from F. Murray Abraham as the older Zero, Jeff Goldblum as Deputy Kovacs, and even the young Zero himself played by newcomer Tony Revolori who is quite a revelation in this picture. Anderson should be credited with another worthy idiosyncratic screenplay and direction of an independent movie. In all, I do think you should check-in and check out ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"".

TGBH, on the other hand, looked promising – interesting, featuring an awesome cast, funny jokes and an actual story and events you can follow.

477,15 February 2016,NateWatchesCoolMovies,8," Unique, quirky and wonderful","I know I'll tick some readers off by opening up this piece by saying that usually I'm not a fan of Wes Anderson's films. But it's the truth. His pristine postcard precision is all well and good, but often seems to be completely absent of any kind of emotional heft with which to round out his visually impressive efforts. His output just has a forced, deliberately quirky vibe that generally makes me want to tear my hair out. Happily, I can say that's changing for me, starting with the excellent Moonrise Kingdom, and continuing on to his absolutely brilliant masterpiece The Grand Budapest Hotel. Finally the man is injecting some human warmth into his pastel pantomimes, giving us something to cling to besides the droll banter he has become famous for. It's like he's reached a maturity in his work that leaves behind the solely idiosyncratic, frustratingly hipster qualities which put him on the map, adding elements that will appeal to more people and in turn make his work much more accessible. Budapest is a rollicking wonder of European wartime wonder as seen through the eyes of the various staff and guests of the titular mountaintop establishment. The dashing concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes in a performance of legendary, dashing suave) takes a young lobby boy Tony Revolori) under his wing, making him privy to a series of madcap adventures involving all kinds of oddball nut jobs from the hotel and the surrounding area. When his elderly lover (Tilda Swinton buried in dusty makeup) croaks, her villainous son (a mustache twirling Adrien Brody) seeks to purloin Gustave's portion of the will with the help of his nasty, stoic henchman Jopling (a priceless Willem Dafoe). The pace quickens as the plot thickens from that point, as Zero meets the love of his life in local chocolatier's assistant Agatha (Saoirse Ronan), and the two of them attempt to evade the law and Brody's reach in the funniest, most touching comedy of errors in years. Anderson attracts some of the best actors around, and here he gathers together the best cast he's ever assembled, including Bill Murray, Fisher Stevens, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Schwartzman, Tom Wilkinson, Mathieu Almaric, Owen Wilson, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law and more. F. Murray Abraham has a touching appearance as the older version of Zero, physically wealthy yet left on his own by time and tragedy. Anderson spins a carnival show of colourful happenings, with a cast that's ready to bite. Die hard fans of is style saw this as another great entry in his filmography.

485,18 May 2015,johnx20,10, A cinematic marvel,"If the world of The Grand Budapest Hotel existed I would enter it immediately, the film that has been created is a visual and character triumph. There are very few films that have been created which convey the precise image that the director had intended, down to the last detail, but the Grand Budapest is one of them. The colour schemes that are used to contrast the mood and the emotion for each scene are impressive enough, but the highly orchestrated set design and props allows for a single shot of a character to reveal their entire personality. From the bright flamboyancy of Gustave H to the dark mysterious persona of Jopling, we see true characters being developed, ones we find ourselves involved in and rooting for. While some may only watch this film, I feel the only way to truly experience it is to analyse. For example, why does Moustafa keep the hotel? Is it the building itself, is it the nostalgia or is it the last remnants of the idea good will and kindness of man creates greatness, not money or greed only by watching can you find out and draw your own conclusion. The world is immersive, the characters are deep and full of personality. The story is truly an amazing achievement. This film is what cinema was made for, I cannot praise it enough.",

It's a very dull & boring story that begins with an old man telling the story of how he acquired his wealth which includes The Grand Budapest Hotel to a writer played by Jude Law. He tells of how he used to be a bell boy at the hotel in which an old lady is murdered & his concierge boss is wrongly accused of the killing. When the old ladies will is read out it turns out she's left a very valuable painting amongst other things to the concierge but when her family disputes this, the concierge takes it & runs for it with the bell boy assisting him. The concierge is then confronted by police about the old lady's murder & goes on the run with the bell boy but is eventually caught & imprisoned. They then come up with an escape plan with other prisoners & break out of prison & go on the run. The story then develops & you learn how the bell boy meets his wife & so on & then the twist at the end, which is the best part of the whole film, is that when the concierge defends the bell boy from a nazi death squad then the concierge is shot dead leaving his inherited wealth to the bell boy.

500,8 May 2014,Sergeant_Tibbs,10, Wes Anderson adds another one to his streak of incredible films.,"I don't know whether it's psychic, fate or coincidence, but Wes Anderson movies always indicate a significant landmark in my life. Now The Grand Budapest Hotel marks my graduation from university. Does the plot have anything to do with this? No, but I will carry that association for the rest of my relationship to the film. It already means a lot to me. There is an irony with the films prologue in how the author says how he has writers block - stated in traditional Wes Anderson affectionate pretence as scribephenia. I saw The Grand Budapest Hotel a month ago and have struggled to begin reviewing the film. It's too rich and too dense. Anderson knows this. In the first 5 minutes we jump from perspective to perspective until we enter the meat of the story. It's a deliberate distraction to provide the amusingly tenuous connection of word-of- mouth myths. It's an interesting setup, almost as if Anderson wants us aware of his presence, but the film doesn't become a true delight until we're introduced to Gustave and Zero.",

502,17 March 2014,eonbluedan-1,7," Impressive, if not for all","Wes Anderson is generally a film maker you either ""get"" or ""don't get"" ; not getting him does not necessarily reflect the quality of the movie. I fall into the camp who can never quite get on board with him, so it is great praise to say I thoroughly enjoyed myself with this light soufflé of a movie. There may be argument about a certain emotional distance from the central theme, or that the film is ultimately less consequential than it should be; in the background of this caper is a looming fascism; the lightness seems at odds with the potential drama of the original writings from which the film takes inspiration. There is also a certain lack of development of characters, although something about the tone allows for this; in any case, it is made up for, to some extent, by the fact that the thing is rammed full of mostly welcome cameos, clearly having a lot of fun with the little moments they have. In another work this may have proved distracting, but in fact here it seems to enhance the enjoyment of events. It is a fresh, offbeat, well designed and choreographed piece; the storybook flourishes, the wonderfully vibrant dialogue, sets designed to withing an inch of life, camera moves and cinematography make the whole thing very sweet and amusing to behold, and this is without mentioning rather splendid, comical central turn from Ralph Fiennes.",
503,14 November 2014,brchthethird,8, A decent and enjoyable tale elevated by visual panache,"Although it has a rather ordinary story, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is told in an interesting way, and with some of the most picturesque cinematic images I've seen in recent years. The story is about Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes), who is the concierge of the titular hotel. He takes a young immigrant boy, Zero, under his wing as his new lobby boy. Over the course of the movie they go on a series of adventures stemming from the death of one of Gustave's many lovers, Madame D (an almost unrecognizable Tilda Swinton) and a painting called ""Boy with Apple."" They also meet many colorful characters on the way, played by Wes Anderson's usual stable of actors. I must confess to not being the biggest Wes Anderson fan, and in fact, this is only the second of his films that I have seen, after BOTTLE ROCKET. There is a certain air of pretentiousness that one can feel about his work, like he's only making these films to amuse himself. Yet, there was a playfulness with this one and, in the end, a rather emotional turn that won me over. Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the film and thought it was immaculately composed from a visual perspective. It was like every frame could be a perfect photograph, and this is definitely where Wes Anderson's strengths lie. I also enjoyed the quirkiness of the characters with which this film was populated. Though most of the big name actors who appeared here took what basically amounted to cameos, they brought a lot to the few scenes in which they appeared. As far as acting is concerned, everyone gave a great performance, especially Ralph Fiennes. Wes Anderson's flowery and poetic dialogue just flowed off of his tongue effortlessly, and with style. The actor who played a young Zero also did a fine job in his first role. Overall, I thought this was an excellent, if typical Wes Anderson film. The story does get a bit convoluted in the end, but the stylistic choices and the way you are enveloped in this fantasy world overshadows any weakness that the narrative has. A definite must-see, especially for Wes Anderson fans.",

The only thrill was trying to be the first to guess which actor was appearing in the next scene. What were those actors thinking when they joined this project ? I fell asleep somewhere in the middle, and when i woke up the nose was still there. What is the purpose of this so called piece of art ? Annoying people to death ?

505,21 April 2014,Troy_Campbell,9, A cinematic delight.,"Wes Anderson is nothing if not unique. His legion of art-house fans adore him for being fresh, chic and not conforming to mainstream marketability. Others only see pretension, pomposity and arty- fartiness (I'm somewhere in the middle). There should be nary an argument about the likability of Grand Budapest though, it's a cinematic delight from start to finish. Anderson leaves no artistic stone unturned; mixing genres, framing four stories (spanning multiple generations) within each other like a Russian nesting doll, toying with aspect ratios and even dabbling in black and white cinematography. The meticulously designed sets, lavish costumes and gorgeous lighting fill each frame with intricate beauty and are ideally accompanied by Alexandre Desplat's sumptuous score. It's all pulled together by Anderson's own cracking script, which supplies a fulfilling narrative and graces the huge ensemble cast with side-splitting one liners. And what a phenomenal cast it is. Outstanding as Gustave H, the suave and enigmatic concierge of the titular hotel, Ralph Fiennes leads a roster that boasts 3 Oscar winners, 8 Oscar nominees and, naturally for a Wes Anderson picture, Bill Murray and Owen Wilson. Uproarious, intriguing, dazzling and affecting – a must see for lovers of old-school cinema.",

Take all the main elements of all his previous films, boil them down to their purest forms and mix them together and this is what will result. I'm not necessarily saying that this is a bad thing, but the forced symmetry and centering, bright colors, and quick dialogue all are a bit overwhelming at times.

It's perhaps his most crisp film yet, and his most gorgeous one. There's the Anderson-esque matter-of-fact humour (""Did he just throw my cat out the window?""), and his alumni make their cameos as usual. The production design and costuming are exquisite, right down to the elegant chapter cards. New technical achievements are evident; the miniature models of the grand pink hotel itself, the snowy trees, the observatory, the diagonal tram all contribute to the dollhouse aesthetic that Anderson has carefully manufactured before, but here it is in even bigger scale. Yeoman's colour palette is again lush, ranging from the ornate warm interiors of the lobby, baby pink walls and bright red carpets, the cold browns of the other mansion of Swinton's recently deceased character, the harsh blue tint of the snowy exterior. What about the contrast of the blue and the orange merry-go-round before that gorgeous shallow focus bokeh shot of Agatha? It absolutely personifies young love. ",

Anderson uses fantastic, technical filmmaking tricks and beautifully crafted CGI work, that really make this film a yarn of dream-like sequences, sprinkled with smart, dark comedy. The story moves back and forth, through time, which allows us to see, not only Zero as a young man, but also as an old man. Anderson travels through different time periods, by utilizing the theatrical space, as an abstraction for the passage of time, by framing the screen, either in standard 4:3 for the 1930s or a mid-sized widescreen for the late 1980s. He interesting enough, frames the old man Zero interview, in the 1960s, in full widescreen. It's a subtle, but effective way to help the flipping, back and forth, between time periods.",

Watch this with an open mind and it will delight you. I watched this not really knowing what to expect but found it to be a wonderland of intrigue . From the very beginning it will lead you through a kaleidescope of mystery and the way the stories all blend together really made me think that the money spent to watch this was well spent. As to people who walked out half way through it serves you right you needed to see the whole thing for all the pieces to fit,

I thought I would indulge in two hours of grandeur, somewhere in the spirit of Titanic and Winter Tale. The first minutes made me sober up already. The next part was more or less bearable, but not really. After 50 minutes I did not know what bothered me more: the film or those bloody uncomfortable chairs in the socialism era built cinema in Slovakia. This film is not brilliant or anything of the exaggerated attributives as I have read here. It is just an utterly boring caricatural persiflage of various comic TV series. The main ingredients are cheap copies of humor chewed out long ago. A little bit of Monty Python, James Bond, Colditz, etcetera, etcetera.

His execution and signature style amazed me throughout. I was worried about the large cast but once it started it was impossible not to be hooked. Ralph Fiennes was a powerhouse and really drew everything together. It was smart too. I laughed at jokes that were repeated from earlier in the movie and laughed in general at the cast of ridiculous hooligans. Not only was the cast amazing, the cut scenes that have the ""Wes Anderson"" are so enjoyable and I said out loud, ""Wow, that looks amazing"". It was such a great theater experience and I would recommend this movie to anyone. So bring your dad, your girlfriend, sister, mom, and even grandparents.

The story is solid, the cast is great, and young actors like the young hotel boy and his fiancée are perfectly picked and it seems all decisions taken by the film-makers fall into place just right. It's certainly a fun ride and never lets down, taking the viewer through a myriad of various chapters in the adventure that is this somewhat outrageous bit of cinema. Some would call it 'precious', I'd say there's a bit of that in there, but overall nobody can deny the heaps of fun this represents at very least on the first viewing.

It wasn't until 2012's ""Moonrise Kingdom"" that I was introduced to the work of the auteur director, and immediately after watching, I blew through his entire filmography and all related works.

A soldier who was considered to have ""contracted"" this ""disease"" was to be shot as if he was a deserter. If this principle was still the prevailing thought today, I, along with many of the characters of this masterful film, would meet the same fate as a Russian soldier.
M. Gustave H is a man so desperately trying to live his old world in a time that has so dramatically left him and his kind behind. Zero's visas MUST allow him passage, they always have.
Zero gave up a massive fortune to a presumably communist government, who possibly would have let him keep it otherwise, just to keep a reminder of his late beloved.
This movie is not what it seems. On the surface, this is a heist movie, a war movie, a comedy, and a picture of the old world where the rich still toured Europe. But this movie, while being all of that, is far, far more. It is a message that all things end. Zero's absolute desolation by the end of the film, his inability to move on from the ""good times"" before the war is a message to us to do just that. Do not linger on the good times until they are no longer. Move on.

But this film was so ridiculously packed with every single actor who had ever appeared in any Anderson film that is was not only annoying but also greatly distracting from the plot. I feel as though this film is a parody of what his films once were, so full of quirk and color and famous actors that the plot (what weak a plot there was) was completely overshadowed.

Not only sets the tone, but really plunges into you. Unnoticed when experienced. Only a whistling excitement throughout. The side-effects will carry on, and plunge to a divinely emotional realm inside the soul. A place without measure, without detection or perfections. It is a place where nothing is everything, and everything is heart-rendering. Hiccups of emotion, from burst inspirations endless. Deep down, one by one, & piece by piece, unravelling empowered moments of the movie in your head. Those are the most unforgotten days in life. Our unfortunate lack of patience and time is shameful. The feeling of inspiration is inhuman, thus unreal and sarcastic in the moment. It's in spirit. And that's what this film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, does.

There is a unique aura throughout the movie that takes the viewer into a different world- one like a fairy tale or a picture book because of its cinematography and effects. (Although it wouldn't be at all for children) The color scheme is beautiful and very visually appealing. Although the story might be predictable and the development of it slightly sudden and unusual and even boring to some people, it is entertaining and it was not tedious at all for me with its short running time.

Firstly and most importantly the visual coherence and beauty of this movie was flawless. I was constantly looking at the screen trying to take it all in, there's just nothing, not even the most tiny little thing, wrong with the aesthetic aspect. Production design and cinematography complete each other and add up to a simply delicious framing, that is explicitly reflected by the wonderful looking cakes in the story. I wasn't always thrilled with the tension scenes, but there is one in particular in the mountains that was extraordinarily magical: shot is such a stylish, thrilling and original way I was genuinely on the edge of my seat. I really can't speak enough of the visual aspect of this movie. Just as good is the acting here, especially Ralph Finnes' performance, delicate and artificial, yet the standouts are everywhere and there were some truly hilarious characters, watch out for Wiliem Defoes' performance. All in all this was a technically brilliant and stylish movie, but I just think that it fell short of something more because of a slight emotional detachment from the story. I have to admit that the central drama of the film, although fairly entertaining, isn't just as fascinating as the initial scenes in the Hotel. What is missing here is the genuine emotion and sentiment of a ""Moonrise Kingdom"", not to say that you aren't involved in the turn-out of events, yet I was always feeling the weight of the movie in my head, something that didn't happen with Anderson's previous film and unfortunately with the exception of some iconic scenes the movie is quite forgettable. This speaks to the missing deep sentimental element of the movie that made Moonrise Kingdom so unforgettable. Despite this lack I still had a great time and was actually surprised by some turns the movie made both in the story both in the style.",

I'm not certain it would fall into the comedy category (which it did for the golden globes and has done on IMDb) though, so don't watch it expecting to be in stitches, as I said it is subtle comedy. There was one slight thing that irritated me; the accents of all the actors were different, with many American actors sticking to their American accents, Saoirse Ronan with her Irish accent, and Ralph Fiennes with his English.But obviously this doesn't retract from the film, just a side note, and the beautiful art and soundtrack alone more than make up for it.

585,7 April 2020,zeekwunlau,8, On the establishment of an independent illusion world,"Watching ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is like pushing a layer of secret doors into a parallel world of real history carefully driven by memories of emotions. Through the vocabulary of this world, we see the thrilling resistance and self-struggle of the weak human civilization under the ""barbarous slaughterhouse"".
Narrative structure
""Symmetry"" aesthetics not only appears in the composition, but also uses a loop-lock structure in the narrative. Tombstones, young writers, conversations between young writers and old Zero, and Zero's memories are repeated in reverse after the memories are over, like piling up precious gifts layer by layer. After attracting people into the play, the spirit that naturally throws people in the world of illusion is guided away. The subtle realization of the ""purification"" effect of Aristotle's ""tragedy"" gives people an excellent and satisfying impression.
Narrative rhythm and audiovisual language
The unique narrative rhythm of the film and audio-visual skills jointly build this independent world. The ubiquitous sense of rhythm creates an unexpected comedy effect, and the serious theme and a serious line of content constitute drama irony. The actions and expressions of the characters, like stop motion animation, enter fast-forward mode when in motion, but also play an extremely prominent and accentuating role when at rest; if the former brings overall ease and humor, then the latter creates a stream of water The rugged rocky reef lurked in the fortress, and was hit at the climax.
Abnormal colors such as pink and the overall dream-like toning atmosphere are spread in the guiding composition; the music is relaxed and eager and has a certain era style. These three are unified in the creative impulse and personal style of the director under the strong emotion of recollecting that particular historical period, which maximizes the illusion of the general 's film and counteracts the reality of setting the world. . For example, Mr. Gustav took a deep breath and leaned slightly after a close-up lens with a side face. The rhythmic and psychedelic music sounded, and the main character walked through the screen with the same rhythm. . This means that Mr. Gustav enters his service role, and also means that the audience enters the specific world constructed by the director.
create character
An important pillar supporting the unique stylized presentation of this film is the symbolization of characters. The placement of the nickname ""Killer"", Zero's ""doorman"" identity throughout, and Mr. Gustav is the embodiment of the classical European noble culture. Behind the story of the encounter between Mr. Gustav and Ozawa Roze, it shows the survival and reaction of a certain spiritual form in a certain environment-a bit similar to the ""scenario"" concept proposed by Mr. Sartre. ""The world maintained by Gustav has long since passed away. He relies on strong personal charm to maintain this illusion as much as possible"" is the most obvious expression.

586,14 August 2021,x_manicure_x,8, Lovely,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" sets itself apart from reality cinema and enchants with an exuberant adventure inspired by early twentieth-century novels. It's a film that allows imagination to run wild without any intention to create the illusion of reality. Visually, it's like flipping through a popup book. I loved how everything is quirky and colorful, yet so refined and sophisticated, with so many little details in each frame to add value to the storytelling. The narration is a bit too fragmented at times, but the fast pacing and sharp script help keep the film fresh and amusing throughout. It's Wes Anderson to the extreme, and a film that does not want to be taken seriously.",

WATCH IT! like it's a film with heart, and power and the characters are awesome and very weird, the way it was filmed was weird, reminded me of an old stage play or something or one of those grand old Hollywood flicks from the earlier days of cinema. with painted backgrounds etc, acting was very nice, the actors were very likable in their roles, not one of the actors fell flat or went out of character or ruined it, I'd say it might be one of my favourite flicks, most possibly, it's really quite cool, I'd suggest anyone of all ages to watch it, I am 18 years of age and I loved it. you find that many people my age aren't into movies with style but because I have an interest in filmmaking etc I love movies from all genres, I have an appreciation for all kinds of movies, just give it a chance I think! 8/10",

Ralph Fiennes puts in a phenomenal performance, and the film is utterly bursting with big names that sadly each only have minimal screentime. Willem Dafoe was brilliant as the psychopathic antagonist, and Jeff Goldblum was, well... Jeff Goldblum - but the film just feels like it's missing something I can't quite put my finger on. Perhaps it's the somewhat unsatisfying ending, or maybe it's the fact the humour doesn't always hit the mark... in any case it's an interesting and entertaining watch that fans of Wes shouldn't miss",

Wes Anderson here brings everything he's ever done together into one film that feels so utterly Anderson that it is insane. I loved the story and thought it was a fun encapsulation of a certain period and place in time but really the only thing to say is that if you don't enjoy films by Wes Anderson you won't get much from this, however, if you've enjoyed his films before you'll be getting more of the same but bigger and crazier than ever. 8/10.",

Sure, his obnoxious camera work and aristocratic narrative nonsense is in full swing here, but Anderson keeps this yarn relatively straightforward and avoids his usual quirky non sequiturs. The art direction is gorgeous to look at and this story book film works because of the structure of the yarn. The teller of the tale is F. Murray Abraham, who gives a nice performance, but this is a Wes Anderson film after all, so while there are a few moments of honesty, this is mostly a madcap farce filled to the brim with broad characters. It's all surface, style, lightweight stuff and doesn't have a millimeter of depth, but this over directed film is Anderson's most entertaining film in quite some time.",

Wes Anderson grants us the privilege of witnessing this visual masterpiece. I love the dialogue because it is so creative and engagingly witty... You fear and root for the characters because they are well-crafted and a treat to watch. I especially like the transformation of Harvey Keitel and William Dafoe, along with Tilda Swinton's fast-mouthed Madame D who is passionately in love with Monsieur Gustave in a tough kind of way. Such amazing characters put into delightful scenes are hard to not laugh at and adore. Some part of me wishes this was a true story because it is a classic tragicomedy.

At this point, his films are an acquired taste, and there's enough of a body of work for people to make up their minds whether they like the brand of hand-made, exquisitely carved life-sized doll houses he's selling (if you told me a major director was also a serial killer, my first guess would be Wes Anderson). I happen to be an avid Anderson fan, but I don't argue with people who aren't. His bouts of whimsy are prone to self- indulgence, and his austere emotionalism can be hard to connect with. He's a tremendous filmmaker but he isn't invincible—The Life Aquatic is self-indulgent, The Darjeeling Limited is just plain bad.

I must admit that I do take prior IMDb ratings into account before watching a movie and I was impressed by this film's high appraisal. Also keeping in mind the noise made by this movie a few years ago at the Oscars, I entered this movie with quite high expectations. This film is nicely paced, and instantly I was put into a trance by the beautifully designed set. I must give credit to Anna Pinnock and Adam Stauckhausen, they rightfully deserved the Academy award for production design on this film. This film is simply beautiful to the eye. This aspect is nicely complimented by the intricate and aesthetically pleasing costume design. The star-studded cast definitely positively impacted my experience. I appreciated the smaller roles played by A-list actors such as Owen Wilson and Bill Murray (Wes Anderson regulars) and others including Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton. The acting in this movie is stellar, especially considering that this type of film/performance is not often seen by mainstream present-day audiences. This is not necessarily your run-of-the-mill movie, but in my opinion that is not a bad thing. Although not typical, I would say most movie-going audiences would enjoy this film as I did. The Grand Budapest Hotel balances just the perfect amount of bizarreness, creativity, sentimentality, independency, and story-telling ability to craft a one of a kind piece that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",

The cast is stacked, I could write a paragraph just mentioning all the actors and actresses I this film. But Ralph Fiennes above all steals the show, with his charm and the iconic dialog given to him. He had my crying laughing just watching him.

Many critique has written that this movie is the best Wes Anderson directorial which can be true as the film was nominated for several categories in Oscars including best movie. However for me the best thing for which I personally recommend you to watch this movie is its cinematography and the cultural portrayal of old Europe for which I would specifically like to mention Robert Yeoman the cinematographer for doing his job fabulously and it should be watched once, as far as for rest of the movie I would say that it is more of a Drama rather comedy with some long list of solid and seasoned cast.

Back in 2012, I was hoping that Moonrise Kingdom might be the film to win me over, but that unfortunately wasn't the case. However, The Grand Budapest Hotel might well be. First off, Ralph Fiennes might've given one of his career's best performances here, portraying a remarkable, amiable concierge that builds a friendship with the new lobby boy at the hotel as a wild journey ensues from there on. Fiennes manages to carry a fine amount of charisma throughout and perfectly fits into Anderson's type of zany world. Another notable showing is Adrien Brody's convincing role as the scheming villain; he's back in full form here, ladies and gentlemen, as he fully encapsulates obnoxiousness and menace at once. ",

633,6 July 2015,torfarrells,10," Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is smarter than you may think","It is almost impossible to describe why The Grand Budapest Hotel was such a success. Anderson has created a film, so ridiculous and intelligent, it is hard to pinpoint where the movie became gold. I will attempt to do so. Its surprisingly captivating premise follows Fiennes' wonderful character M. Gustave, the vein, witty and legendary hotel concierge, who steals the spotlight with an eye catching purple tux. His character meets Zero (Tony Revolori), the new purple suited lobby boy who soon becomes his most loyal of friends. In its own way, the movie cannot be classified into one genre. There is some comedy, placed in the perfect places to draw attention to what was necessary— but overall the film deals with much more intense subject matter. It deals with loss, greed and value— breaking the imaginary world the characters are placed in. Its charming yet true dialogue opens up a whole new side of every character we see on screen. We get true depth into the minds of every character, gaining different intelligent perspectives of worth and wealth in the minds of fictional yet relatable characters. The film also successfully obtains an Inception storyboard, going from different time periods and locations but centring on one clear message, that being about life of a man who was wealthy and alone— to becoming a man who was loyal, honest and brave. Dealing with the loss of his friend (a 100 year old version of Tilda Swinton), it is discovered that her most priced possession— the symbolical Boy with an Apple painting— has been given to Gustave, instead of her greedy children. The apple of temptation and knowledge places a spell on Dimitri (the brilliant Adriaan Brody), who stops at nothing to retrieve the painting back. The film will be known for its glorious sets— bursting with colour and exploding with detail— but what was as clever was the charming atmosphere that was created. It is extremely difficult to create a good movie, but what is even harder— is to make a good movie that viewers will want to re-watch over and over again. Brilliantly, Wes Anderson has done so. A.

The ending was good too, wrapped up the films events well. Will definitely be looking into more wes anderson films and rewatching this one.",

The obsession that was also present in Anderson's latest work, The Realm of the Rising Moon, easily sought the genius of the writer and director and enjoyed the words of the characters in his story. The Budapest Grand Hotel is in a relatively similar situation to The Realm of the Rising Moon, except that it is far more comedic and set in a more limited space than The Realm of the Rising Moon, so the script requires that in the same situations. Limited, let creativity take shape, which fortunately Anderson has proven to be one of the most creative live directors in the world.",

Its by far one of the funniest movies Ive watched this year, which is helped by quite brilliant relationship between Zero and Gustave.

The story follows the main character, Gustave an over zealous concierge who thrives at pleasing guests in any way possible. The plot finds one of the hotel's guest dead and her family's fight for her will ensues. It is no wonder that the hotel is at the center of the dilemma because it houses all the secrets and deceptions of the movie. It is almost as if the hotel is telling the story. In fact, the movie personifies the hotel through the richness and exuberance of all its workers and guests.",

I'm a sucker for Wes Anderson films and this one had it all; murder, war, love, assassinations, bobsledding, cats, prison... all the absurdities one would expect from Anderson and an amazingly stacked cast. Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori were an unlikely, but incredibly likeable duo. I wanted to be a part of their friendship/mentorship/family. In true Wes Anderson fashion, heavy themes of grief, death, belonging, identity and love were explored through the symmetrical lens of color and wit. The Royal Tennebaums still holds the first place Wes Anderson spot for me personally, but this is a close second.

It is not like any other comedy movies which contains double meaning jokes or creates situation comedy and that is what makes it special.

The story follows the life of Z. Mustafa, and his adventures with the charming M. Gustave, wonderfully portrayed by the ever impressive Ralph Fiennes. Filled with bright colours and vivid imagery, the film never provides a dull moment in its entirety. However, the most striking feature of this film is that even the most gruesome acts are portrayed in such a manner that it borderlines on euphemism.

658,8 April 2023,timothywalton-31924,7," A zany, finely crafted treat","The Grand Budapest Hotel is eccentric, zany and whimsical- characteristic of the Wes Anderson style of filmmaking. It is also quite delightful. The plot is not some intricately assembled thriller masterpiece, but an outrageous, implausible story with surprising depth. This depth lies with the themes of the film- that of an aristocratic old world eroded by, as Gustave puts it, 'barbarians'. The hotel gradually loses its opulence and luxury because the world is changed- such luxury is no longer fashionable or desirable given the changing economic realities of the time. Funnily enough, the film has some of the same themes as La grande illusion, though told in a more whimsical way. Then film is also very beautifully and stylistically shot- it has the cotton candy colours reminiscent of the works of Jacques Demy, idiosyncratically filmed in an unusual aspect ratio which heightens the eccentricity of the piece. The set design is also without peer- it is elegant and lavish, impeccably appointed, and combined with the saturated cinematography, further detaches us from its realism, making us acutely aware that the film is not meant to be seen through cold, realist eyes. Ralph Fiennes adds to this sense of eccentricity with an astounding performance- often typecast into playing villains, now plays the often comedic lead role, as an endearing concierge who is not afraid to say what is on his mind(like a posh Gordon Ramsay really) but also genuinely enjoys his job(partly because he gets to sleep with rich old women). The film however is too zany for my liking- it does have an engaging story, but it is so pulled back from reality that I cannot appreciate it fully. Indeed Wes Anderson style may not be to everyone's tastes- In this film he leaps and breezes through his films plot, refusing to slow down his film for suspense, action, or anything which does not add to its peculiar style. Regardless, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a great film I can see many enjoying, for like the pastry at Mendls, it is beautiful, delicious, and delightful.",
659,1 April 2014,chelseaohmyy,10, There is hope for film's future after all. Wes out does himself.,"I have to admit and I hope you all will look past that I am extremely bias when it comes to Anderson's movies. But I would say that if you're new to his work this would be the perfect movie to start out with. The Grand Budapest holds truth to the uniquely colorful scenery, quirky characters and erratic story line of all of We's previous films but also has a pinch more mainstream feel to it with a more define and obvious conflict and a discernible line between the protagonists and antagonists. Wes was able to incorporate the right ingredients of comedy and drama that a lot of other movies that try to do this cannot find the right equation of the two without making it too dark or too bubbly that the drama seems almost unbelievable. The ending is that impressed me the most. After the protagonist's valiantly solve their conflict, guy gets girl, guy gets money, we're almost brought to tears to know that their happiness would not last. Even Zero, at the end says "" We were happy, for a little while"" ( paraphrase). And while this might be a excretion of my own taste, my own love for indifferent endings that happiness does not last, and Wes knows as in a few of his other movies that even if you do everything right, life doesn't always have a happy ending. And that impressed me the most. That and his quirky Gestapo. Wes really out did himself on this movie, Defiantly one of his best.",

I have never seen anything like this before, and this is one of the best examples of creative world building I have ever seen. Beautiful visuals in every single scene, not to mention the dry comedy that makes this a masterpiece. Not everyone will like it. It is awkward, weird, and out of context at times. However, if you watch this with an open mind and watch for the details and visual comedy, you will love it. Comedy is a declining genre with the overbearing and boring jokes in every line. Wes anderson is the definition of visual comedy, and he has been a pioneer in the genre alongside edgar wright. Every scene is hilarious if you pay attention to details. My favorite scene is where you see them grab a ladder and carry it through the frame horizontally, where it seems to go on for at least 100 feet. These little additions make this film a masterpiece.",

That being said, The Grand Budapest Hotel takes that very recognizable element of Wes Anderson's well-established style and embodies it in the most thoroughly enjoyable way yet.

663,23 August 2020,joncha,8, Would make a great operetta,"The Keystone Kops meet Victor Herbert. All that is needed is for everyone to break out singing every now and then and this would be a great operetta, a melodrama set in the fictional European Republic of Zubrowka. The single camera technique employed by director Wes Anderson (only moving side-to-side or front-to-back-to front) can become tiresome at times but generally maintains its role as providing a special feeling to this fairy tale. Anderson's style includes what film critic Judith Crist called the ""Hey there..."" technique. She was referring to biblical epics of the 1960s with many famous actors in bit roles. It applies here, for example: ""Hey there, it's Bill Murray!"" or ""Hey there, it's Bob Balaban!"" etc. Another frustration with the film is its fast pace and quick screen shots. There is so much detail in each setting that you want to feast your eyes on the grandeur (as well as visual ""in"" jokes). For that reason, it's best viewed as a DVD so you can back up and watch scenes over and over again",

The characters are not written as ordinary human beings, but still, you find the humanity in them and connect with them in ways you wouldn't expect. The music is fantastic and the cinematography is beautiful, which is especially appealing due to the various aspect ratio changes that Wes uses throughout the picture, as well as the gorgeous color palette. Highly recommended if you want to see Anderson's unique style shine at its finest. I am eager to rewatch it already.",
667,25 January 2023,itakethesquare,8, Wes Anderson films are pop-up books with realism.,"Every single one of Mr. Anderson's films are pleasantly retrospective, artsy, and pay homage to simpler times. However, he mixes the pleasantness with darker undertones that are hyper-realistic involving graphic violence, language, and taboos. There's nothing wrong with that as a matter of fact I promote the morbid curiosity that he puts in his otherwise 'wholesome' debuts.

668,10 March 2014,Pankakesnotstellar,10, Dazzlingly staged black comedy,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is that rare entertainment that comes in a shiny pink candy box decorated with a black ribbon. It sweeps you off your feet and takes you into a journey of surreal and dark comical adventure. The best kind of adventure. It is the story of a master concierge living his life in an almost imperial dream intertwined with a picture of Europe preparing for war. It is a beautiful combination and it highlights a great film direction. Life's little problems(like getting one's deserved part of the heritage) inside life's big problems(like facing the ever increasing oppression of war and surviving a document control in the process) are golden moments of storytelling, of dark humour and finally of the very warmth of a human heart. Anderson's unique universe has excellent production design, cinematography, music and editing. The parade of stars and cameos takes away nothing from the surreal portraying of nearly all the characters. Ralph Fiennes is very good as the master concierge and his delivery is well timed. Another character I really enjoyed was the one played by Willem Dafoe who hardly says anything during the whole film. It just shows the level of art in this film. Light and dark Entertainment at its best.",

All these factors make this film an enchanting pop-up book come to life, which in no way trivializes the harsh realities of war, of loneliness, of greed; but instead, heightens the purity of kindness, and treats the subject with the courageous optimism of Fellini's ""Nights of Cabiria"".",

As with most Wes Andersson movies though it turned out I really had no need to worry - whatever I thought I had figured the movie to be about beforehand was not even close to what I'd find.
The movie didn't have a single slow moment, always something going on. Camera angles, colouration and characters are quirky and swift as is Wes' characteristics. I'm not the biggest fan of Anderson myself, though I did also enjoy Moonrise Kingdom which this movie do have similarities too both in how the story is told and the characters, but this is a movie I believe will do well even with the people that might not be into the slower, more artsy movies.

673,2 June 2020,adeckofcards,9, The magic of framing,"From the first general shot that the film opens, we realize that Wes Anderson takes great care of the frame, which predominates totally in this work. Each shot is cared to the millimeter, in absolutely the entire film we delight in an absolutely stunning cinematographic frame, perhaps too perfect. The static camera with lateral and panoramic movement predominates in general shots that serve not only to tell the story, but even more, to locate the viewer in the context of the characters. Protagonists that Anderson repeatedly places in a painting within the painting or in a circular vignette, making sure that the attention does not leave what is intended to be shown.
And just as he perfectly handles the framing, Anderson also manages to mix or honor different genres, like musicals, comedy, or even silent movies, making it totally work.
We are probably facing one of the most aesthetic films in recent years. Wes Anderson manages to innovate and achieve a fun story with the great success of the frame, which totally steals the attention with its vibrant colors, bright settings and magic that stands out at all times.",

In terms of its content,I think it conveys a sentiment that pays tribute to a kind of gentlemanship that is lost before the World War Two.Mr.Gustave,a perfect example of such spirit ,was shot to death by the overbearing military.I am moved from time to time by Mr.Gustave's gentile and noble deeds.For example,he takes care of the inmates at Check Point 19,which also helps his own escape.And even maybe at the last moment of his life,he doesn't forget to recite an excerpt of a poem.Not to mention,he protests the thuggery at the cost of his own life.Yet he is not a saint,of course,he is vain,needy,insecure and a little mean,I guess.

686,4 March 2018,morrismatalon,9, One of the best films of 2014,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is fantastic. Wes Anderson puts so much work into every film he's made. He's a great filmmaker, and he has really out done himself here. The style and cinematography always matches the time period and place. His style is amazing. He uses lighting and shot placement to establish emotions in a very affective way. Every shot is symmetrical and every pan, or zoom, or tracking shot is mastered and used to great affect. He makes intentional mistakes and uses different aspect ratios so he can make you feel like you are watching a film from whatever time period the scene is taking place in. Ralph Fiennes is great in this movie. I think he gave the best male performance of 2014, and he was snubbed. Anyway besides the style , the comedic script is very good. The way it sets the tone, it really is an escape from reality. The only (very minor) complaint is that there was one sequence where they used CGI which would have been betterif they used practical effects.

These two narratives correlate to create this ultimate, immersive, graphic, and evocative stream. it's a story, inside a story, inside a story, inside a story, and each story is loyal to its period's popular aspect ratio ( yes the changing of aspect ratio has a meaning), it's a perfect comedic tragedy wes took from the comedic language oof twenties and thirties cinema and gave it a twist of modernity. Emotions are conveyed with colors, light, and mise on scene techniques rather than poignant dialogues or melodrama, and it worked perfectly. This film touches the spectator on a sensual level, it's engaging and makes you wanna dive in its world. in general, it reminded me of the euphoria I felt when I watched movies as a child. it's definitely Wes Anderson on steroids embracing nostalgia and fighting tyranny with irony, frivolity, and unshakable charm (hens the ZZ is a hint to the dutch SS). a perfection and one of my fave of all times.",

The sets are brilliant and realistic, and the actual hotel was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. The story line is one of the best that I have ever experienced in a movie, and the film is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It is magnificent. It mixes action, comedy, thrillers and a dash of romance to create what I think is definitely the best film of 2014. When I walked into the cinema to watch this film for the first time I had very high expectations thanks to Anderson's previous masterpiece, Moonrise Kingdom, when I walked out of the cinema I knew that it had lived up to its expectations, later becoming one of the best movies that I have ever seen.",

The acting was great by Ralph Fiennes(Gustave H) and zero(Tony Revolori) aka lobby boy. There were lots of great cameos by Bill Murray,Owen Wilson,and many more great actors and actress.

There are fleeting cameos from, most notably, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel & Willem Dafoe. Dafoe was doing an impressive impersonation of Christopher Walken's headless horseman from 'Sleepy Hollow'.

712,5 April 2014,gumperman,9, Delicious!,"Being a fan of Wes Anderson's unique film style, I was defiantly going to see this movie. The thing is, his films always open in limited release, so I have to end up waiting longer than the initial release date for his films to finally show up in my area. When this finally arrived in my area, I wasn't aware at first, thinking I would have to drive 45 minutes to the art house theater that I knew the film would be at. It turns out in opened in the Regal Cinema that was in the same city that I worked at, so as soon as I got off of work that Saturday night, I went to see the late night showing of this film. What I expected was to be entertained by Wes Anderson's whimsy, and the quirky characters and wonderful performances by his always top notch cast. What I got was exactly that and then some. I believe this is one of, if not the best Wes Anderson film I have ever laid my eyes upon. It was such a pleasant film going experience and I couldn't help but have a smile on my face the entire film, it seemed. What it felt like and looked like was your typical fast paced Wes Anderson live action film, but mixed in with effects shots that reminded me of the stop motion he used in The Life Aquatic underwater scenes and the entire film of Fantastic Mr. Fox. The shots were not stop motion in this film, but they did have sort of a model village look to them and were used to quite comical and great effect. The colors used in the sets and costumes in this film were very nice to look at too, and just made you want to be apart of this world. The wonderful score by Alexandre Desplat, continuing his collaboration with Anderson since Mr. Fox, was defiantly a treat as well and even sounded at times almost exactly like his music from Mr. Fox. Though that is only probably because he is in a similar styled world as that one, and more importantly, it is Desplat's own unique style. In closing, if a film could be described as delicious, this is one that should be described as such! :)",

No special effects, but cute little models depicting the scene, even the gorgeous wedding-cake facade of the hotel itself. And it was eastern Europe epitomised to perfection. My ancestral roots are in that region, and I saw so many of the quirky mannerisms that populated my distant childhood, those of relatives now long gone who were young adults there in the 30s.

I wouldn't want to see it as a trend, but this film, much like pepper, adds a little spice to a dull mainstream. Makes me long for simpler times...when a phone call happens on a rotary dial, where an actual connection happens. Not like these days, people too busy to look at one another. I won't be surprised if this film doesn't do well, just because of the slapstick and throwback to Chaplin, Stooges, etc. One tiny note of contention, the audio seems to fluctuate a little too much for my taste.

And I don't particularly like cartoons or plays. The only thing it has going for it is its unique style but that can only hold my attention for so long.

755,19 May 2014,rickhouska,8, Another Wes Anderson Adult Fairy Tale,"Once upon a time, in a place named after a rather tasty, flavored Polish vodka, there was a great hotel and an even greater concierge. Therein lies a cleverly conceived story within a story, which touches humorously, and occasionally darkly, upon almost every human emotion. Notable among these are love, lust, greed, fear, happy, sad, silly, and, of course, mad. We connect with these emotions mainly through the exploits of the main character, M. Gustave, the impeccably correct, near perfect concierge played by Ralph Fienes and his able, young protégé, Zero, played by Tony Revolori. Their acting is superb, aided by (usually) very well crafted screen writing,and story telling But there's more. The movie includes a veritable menagerie of wacky characters, many from the Anderson stable, and others, all of whom perform well. If you're an Anderson fan, the movie is a must see. If not, despite the fine acting and writing, and sets, the story could become a little tedious. But, should that be the case, you are urged to sit through the movie trailer, and its fascinating balalaika music, which will make all but the most sleepy person wake-up and feel good, before leaving the theater. Also, to celebrate your experience and if you like vodka, try to find Zubrowka (pronounced zha-broof-ka), and see what buffalo grass tastes like...I am convinced this movie was fun to make, and and should be fun to watch for all but the most literal minded and sober viewer.",

757,23 March 2014,glasslens,7," Somewhat self-indulgent and some other problems, but excellent in parts","There is a bit of the King's Magic Suit Of Clothes about this film. A bit like ""modern art"", lots of people will pretend that they like it when in reality they don't. It is self-indulgent for sure and at times Anderson is clearly amusing himself. There is a similarity of style between Anderson and Jean-Pierre Junet (Amelie etc) but Junet has real style to go with his wit whereas Anderson is lacking in these subtleties a lot of the time. I also had a problem seeing what was going on for some of the time. Everything was very dark and perhaps my cinema has a poor projector, but I have never encountered this problem there before and I go frequently. Also the editing was very erratic - some shots needed longer because there was lots to take in that was relevant to the plot. Others were indulgently drawn out. I think I need to see this film again because I think I missed some of the plot and some of the clever ""only on for a second"" shots. On the plus side, the characters and the actors were excellent. The sets were stunningly brilliant. The story is fascinating and some of the dialogue sparkles with humour. Some of the shots such as the red lift scene are beautifully made and the actors and camera movements are clever before they become repetitious. ",

I liked the film a lot but the film as a whole isn't masterpiece. Many moments are very good but not all. One couldn't say that The Grand Budapest Hotel is complete masterpiece. Because if you watch it carefully ( which you should always ) you'd find little continuity mistakes, movie mistakes which we'd not expect from Filmmakers like Wes Anderson and films like that which are famous and made with care. Those mistakes are like pineapple on delicious pizza. Although the film was way too good in editing, sound quality was amazing and was a complete experience of an artistic cinema. If only those mistakes were covered and plot in the mid was fixed with less satire and more thriller, TGBH could've been the best thriller from 2010s.

The movie is strange and maybe even a little bit disturbing but in a good way. The acting of Ralph s.

Is there anything funny at all? 4) The plot is very poor, the story does not make any sense even if it were just a wild fantasy. 5) What am I suppose to take out of this movie? A number of nice pictures? Is it not too little? 6) The movie is full of stars. However, I am afraid it does not help at all. In summary, I really regret watching this movie.

The Grand Budapest Hotel is certainly true to its grandeur title, boasting the broad and sensational world of Gustave H. (Ralf Fiennes, Schindler's List), the fabled concierge of the ages and the celebrity of the Grand Budapest Hotel itself. When an unexperienced refugee lobby boy, Zero (Tony Revelori), seeks an adept mentor, he is instead dragged into the confounding and bizarre world full of brass-knuckled psychopaths, diabolical schemers, and an immense conspiracy spanning a soon to be war-torn Europe.

There is something about the pacing, the use of language, and that trademark Wes Anderson look that renders a fresh and completely new experience.

Instead, there are tons of references to historical events, all slightly altered and often very randomly put together. 
In addition to that, there's a lot of completely unnecessary violence. As for the ,,funny'' scenes - I didn't laugh once. Maybe, if you're not familiar with European history and don't mind the completely random mixing of historical references (and accents) you might enjoy this movie - otherwise it's a complete failure.",

Have been a fan of him ever since for his role as ""Amon Goeth"" in Schindler's List, and yet again he does a great job in a complete alternate character of M.Gustave in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". The entire cast, which consists of known faces such as Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Adrian Brody, Willem Dafoe and Jude Law really adds up to the icing on the cake as far as acting is concerned. Well the film has its own level of dark and violent moments, which in fact enhances the excitement levels even more.

Loved lots of familiar actors like owyen wilson and bill murray randomly showing up. The two keys of hotel union was a great add. Agatha and Zero were adorable and I liked how she wasn't just introduced randomly there were hints at the beginning of her. I just know the story telling was a little off as i was watching i forgot it was being told by someone but that can be good or bad. I thought the ending of the story was a little rushed gustavo was shot that's it?!v After all that no funeral or how his death affected zero that was disappointing but overall great movie wow.

Gustave represents the typical Concierge for a large full service hotel. Every guest loves him and he know each guests personal life, much like any modern concierge. He accomplice, or protégé, Zero has much to learn before one day taking the reins. The movie goes very slow throughout, yet Wes Anderson has a unique way of continue the story in a slow paced motion while continuing to advance the plot quickly. The narration was short, sweet, and to the point, not overdone or to an annoyance. The only issue I had with this movie was that you have to pay close attention to the subtitles and declaration of time. There is a lot of jump back between Past and Present.",

He is spectacular here. I never thought he had so much comedic chop in him. He carries the whole movie almost single-handed, perfectly playing the haughty and suave but hopelessly insecure and lonely concierge. Forget other stellar cast, who play more or less cardboard cliche characters. Forget cinematography and production design, which are very pretty but unrealistic. For me this film was worth watching because of the amazing performance by the lead actor. I have to add that young Tony Revolori as the lobby boy was equally great.

This movie is expertly crafted including details such as the aspect ratio changing so it matches that of what time period it is based in. This movie is mostly done with special effects including old effects such as when a character has a nose bleed the blood painted on does not match up to their nostril and they use many painted backdrops in the film. The only scene that bothered me in the movie was the CGI skiing scene, it's not a bad scene it's just the CGI used looks a bit out of place considering the rest of the movie but that's my only problem with the movie.

852,4 April 2014,zachhaayema,10, His Films are like Paintings.,"Generally I can uncover or decipher a main argument a director is attempting to make with his or her film. For Wes Anderson, however, I have had a difficulty trying to uncover exactly what he is trying to say. Sure he makes jabs at the falsivity of commercial filmmaking, he pushes the bounds of good taste by humorizing sometimes heavy subject matter, but I wouldn't say that's what his films are about per se. In the case of The. Grand Budapest Hotel... It follows a similar structure to other Wes Anderson films, the cinematography is fantastic (hard to believe not Oscar winning) the acting is spot on (though acting in Anderson's films is probably not the most difficult though still well executed) and the editing is well done. Perhaps what Anderson is getting at here is that his films are like paintings and that he is the painter. The composition of each of his shots is meticulous and deliberate, much like a painting. The framing of the film is also generally stable with little camera movement. These elements make for films unlike any other, and it is quite refreshing and enjoyable. I would reccome do anyone see this film (age appropriate of course, there is some shocking violence) and I myself will more than likely see it again.",

854,26 May 2014,blagomeni,8, delicious piece of cinematography,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a movie that is equally perfect and sweet as one of the ""Mendl's"" pastry boxes so frequently featured in the story. It is like a box of presents tied firmly with a shiny silk ribbon. This is one of those movies you can enjoy on several distinct levels. The most striking layer of the movie, at least to me, is the use of colors, props and sets. The ever present pastels vary from earthly yellow to raspberry pink and then back to grays and browns. Some parts of the movie are shown in black & white, masterfully blended in the story so that they are hardly noticeable. The next layer comprises of the special makeup effects combined with the use of contact lenses and outrageous hairstyles which add to the visual attractiveness of the movie. The story, though funny and daring, does mostly serve as a scaffold supporting the visual treats that are masterfully plastered on it. The use of language and narrative techniques wrap the entire project up like the previously mentioned silk ribbon. Each and every cast member contributed immensely to the beauty of the project. Starting with supporting roles, it is simply impossible not to mention the very short but absolutely adorable appearance of Tilda Swinton who is transformed beyond recognition. Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel and many others contributed to the perfection of acting in individually flavored manner, blending seamlessly into the flow. Ralph Fiennes is adorable in his role of M. Gustave. His character is stimulated to brilliance by the performance of Tony Revolori. The intricate ballet the two perform serves as the backbone of the story. The sets are amazing. Models blend perfectly with the locations in the Czech Republic. Open spaces and winter scenery provide the canvas for the dynamic story telling. This is a visually stunning movie that may not please our average moviegoer. It is an exercise in masterful application of cinematic techniques and tools. I had a great time watching it and would wholeheartedly recommend it. You will most probably leave the cinema with a mischievous smile on your face.",

863,5 February 2016,pastrunho,9, Wonderful!,"This is not a new film but I watched it again yesterday and I every time time I have the pleasure to watch I remember why I love it so much! This movie is basically a story within a story. In fact it starts in the present with a girl in a park reading a book, in front of a monument of the author. In the book The Author is sitting at his desk in 1985 and narrates the trip he made in 1968 to The Grand Budapest Hotel where he met Mr. Moustafa, who told him the story of how he became the owner of the hotel. And again we go back, to 1932, when M. Gustave was the Grand Budapest's devoted concierge. The most wonderful thing about this storytelling is how cleverly is done. The present is shot in 16:9, the trip he made in 1968 is shot in classic cinema ratio 2.35:1 and the story of M. Gustave and Zero, the lobby boy, is portrayed in 4:3. The directing by Wes Anderson here is at his best. I absolutely love his style and the work he's done here is outstanding. A hand of applause to the cinematography as well, simply marvellous. This movie is an incredible pleasure to watch. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you wonder what they're going to find themselves in next. It's a masterpiece of soft comedy narrated through bright colours and wonderful photography. And even with Birdman as an opponent this film managed to win 4 of the 9 Oscars it was been nominated for. Surely if The Grand Budapest Hotel came out in a different year it would have won Directing, Writing and Cinematography as well. But as I always say Oscars don't make a movie better and this film is absolutely fantastic as it is, with or without those Academy Awards.",

Because the credits don't roll until the drama is over I spent a lot of time thinking, ""Oh, yeah, what's his name? He's older now too."" That was diverting. And the acting was well-executed but kind of ""showed"" a lot, it seemed to me. I'm not saying I'm sorry I saw the movie. But I kept wondering while I was watching if it was one of those boardgames adapted to the screen. Perhaps I have lost my sense of humor? Was I expecting an homage and viewed a satire instead?

Sometimes with a title card saying when/where and/or the reason why, sometimes without. And he does this like he does everything, the way he wants to.

879,18 February 2016,johnbrittain,10, Anti-clichés (contains spoilers),"(Contains spoilers): What I like about certain scenes in the movie is the way they turn certain film clichés on their heads, with unexpected results. The most obvious one is when Serge's sister's head comes out of the basket, instead of Agathe's, which we are led to expect. Another one is when Gustave is accosted by the police in the lobby and accused of the crime. The expected follow-up is that the accused will stand there and try to talk his way out of it, but Gustave unexpectedly hightails it. Another more subtle one is the scene in the prison when Gustave is serving mush. When he serves it to the ferocious-looking convict, we expect that guy to go into a rage, a la the guy in the prison mess scene in ""Stir Crazy"", but the convict likes it.There are probably more of these things that other people can spot. Then, on top of those are the references to other films: Jopling cracking the ice from under Gustave on the cliff, a la ""North by Northwest"", and the cable car transfer, a la each least one Bond movie. All in all, a totally funny movie that has to be seen many times to get all the funny bits. (How about the gas station with the big ""FUELITZ"" sign over it!",

My absolute favorite thing about this movie was the dialogue between M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and any of the other characters. He was just perfectly hilarious while being so well mannered and polite. Movies with delicious looking food is also a plus. The bakery pastries looked so cute along with everything else in this gorgeous film. The mansion, hotels, and even the prison settings were wonderful to look at.

882,18 June 2019,masterofxo,9, A breathtaking tapestry of beautiful images and brilliant characters!,"As one can guess by the title of this review, The Grand Budapest Hotel is one heck of a film. No, this isn't just a movie but also a fine specimen of the artistic brilliance of Wes Anderson and the team.
Admittedly, I'm rather late to the party and shamefully enough, I have not been witness to much of Anderson's work. But, that doesn't stop me from appreciating the fact that TGBH has aged like fine wine.
The frames are so immaculately shot yet so simple when you think about it. There's a sort of mechanical precision in the way Anderson and his DP capture the story. The grandeur of the setting is expressed beautifully and use of colour and the colour theory is so damn well-done!
The characters are so....unique. And interesting. And engaging. It's as if I'm reading literature, there's some sort of 'literary texture' in the way they speak, interact and move. So engrossing!
The plot itself is not really complex and is rather straightforward and even comical at times. It's really absurd and that's Anderson's whole shtick, isn't it?",

How often are we fortunate to see such a high level of acting, dialogue and of course cinematography. The beginning is a little slow but as soon as we are in the 1930s it really takes off and there is no major flaw to find throughout the movie, its just really satisfying to watch. I am also often guilty of writing off movies as pretentious but this one is just simply great, period! (or exclamation mark in this case)",

887,2 November 2014,LuisZanforlin,9," The film is great, full of fun adventures and lovable characters","The Grand Budapest Hotel is a comedy set between world wars one and two, Gustave H, the Grand Budapest Hotel concierge and Zero Moustafa, his ""lobby boy"" embark on a crazy adventure when one of Gustave's lover and guest dies leaving him a very important and expensive painting at her will. The film is divided into three time periods, the 80's 60's and 30's all easily distinguishable through the Grand Budapest Hotel's impeccable decoration. The film is very stylistic with it's bright colours and camera angles which gives the aspect of a very organized chaos and allows for a number of image systems to be placed without the fear of interfering with the plot. The most obvious image system is it's own crop factor. The film variates between three different aspect ratios which separates the three different time periods. During the 80's we experience a cinema-scope aspect ratio (2.35:1), when the characters are in the 60's the film is shown at standard wide-screen (1.85) and throughout most at the film which happens in the 30's the factor is in 4x3 (1.37). From the beginning to the end of the film's time-line the Hotel gets progressively worst and so does the posture that the characters adapt, with the choice of replicating the time periods using aspect ratio it also helps to unbalance the frame weight, the closer to a square the more balance a frame will be at both the X and Y axis, this is also noticeable with the lens choice that gets wider within time generating more and more curved lines and distancing the viewer from an idealistic symmetry. An other very obvious image system is the film's own colour pallet. Each hotel, institution, family or just any group of people have it's own key colour and Wes Anderson uses it as a conscious device that helps the viewer orients himself in the story with this unusual method. The Grand Budapest Hotel staff is always wearing a purple uniform, the family of Gustave's lover (which represents the film's antagonist) always wears black, the prisoners wear a tinted pattern of white and gray stripes, the police force wears gray (part of the antagonistic factor throughout most of the film), the other hotels has it's representatives wear the same saturation value ￼￼￼￼ of the purple uniform but with blue, orange, red, green and brown uniforms, the monks are always wearing white robes and Agatha (love interest) is often bringing with her a pink box from her bakery. In this case the amount of saturation seams to be an equivalent to the ""goodness"" of the characters, which makes for a very easy way to understand who is who at chaotic scenes with hundreds of extras, such as the final battle at the hotel. Throughout the entire film characters are shown from different kinds of rectangular frames which gives the viewer the ability to reflect the scene as if seen from the inside of the film but as an outsider to the action, it is as if we were watching it all from a window, it also makes for a very comedic motif. Some of the characters are shown with a circle vignette around their face, because the only two characters whom are presented with the vignette in the end of their development are the ones that goes through certain character change, the unusual effect could be associated with the closure of the character's internal development. The entire film is filled with little image systems, shapes and interesting frames that fits beautifully within this world where everyone tries to act as robotically polite as possible at the most chaotic situations which makes for a grate example of format following content.",
888,22 May 2015,pinku_ashusatapathy,8, Beautiful movie,loved it As it goes flawless movie for me in the view of acting is concern. I strongly believes it might have gone for winning Oscars if it has released in 2 to 3 years back. I love the whole cast. Ralph Fiennes as Gustave is amazing and he is one of the best lead roles in an Anderson movie to date. Newcomer Tony Revolori easily keeps up with Fiennes doing a fantastic job. Everyone else from Norton to Ronan are fantastic. The set design and cinematography are magnificent as usual with great scenery and cool children book style backgrounds. The comedy hits every time and it even packs some surprises to with a great murder mystery that gels with a road film. There's even some sweetness underneath the zaniness giving it some surprising depth to it.,

Wes Anderson, the director of this movie, has done such a brilliant job creating this masterpiece. Every scene seemed to be perfect and well-thought according to my aspect, Robert Yeoman (cinematographer) is very clever for creating scenes with aesthetically pleasing colors and angles to attract the person watching, the vibe of the movie is what made me most excited to watch it. The plot is fun, exciting, and funny. Not a movie that you'd find yourself yawning half-way. Zero (Tony Revolori) is the new lobby boy that finds himself on an unusual adventure with M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) his manager.",
892,6 December 2017,mjlinek,10, A visually stunning interpretation of a coming of age story,"he Grand Budapest Hotel is the story of Zero Moustafa, played by F. Murray Abraham and Tony Revolori, and his adventures with M. Gustave, played by Ralph Finnes. The story revolves around the death of a wealthy patron, Selene Villanova DeGoeff und Taxis played by Tilda Swinton, and the ensuing adventures created by the disposition of her estate. At its heart, this is a coming of age story but instead of the usual formula of a young person finding their way in the world we have a maturing of both main characters in as they are forced to confront a changing world out of their control. From the view point of our main character Zero, this is a classic young hero motif as he seeks to create his own future by emulating his new-found hero, M. Gustave and gain some entry into the closed luxurious world of The Grand Budapest Hotel. In contrast, M. Gustave matures throughout the movie and his interactions with Zero as he begins to realize he may care about something other than himself and his wealthy patrons, namely his protégé Zero. The genius of Wes Anderson is truly on display in this film as he brings these two characters closer together of the course of several adventures and interactions. This is best illustrated in the contrast between the linked scenes in the train stopped in a barley field. The first time this happens and violence ensues M. Gustave shouts, ""Get your hands off my lobby boy"" while the second time he says, ""Get your hands off him"". As can be seen from the difference in phrasing the two main characters have grown together in a significant way. Wes Anderson has been honing this thematic technique throughout his career with movies such as ""The Life Aquatic"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" which are essentially movies about identity and discovering one's self in a world which one may not fit in. In The grand Budapest Hotel, he takes his vision to new heights by creating a world unto itself using nearly recognizable events and places. While there is no place called Zubrowka or Lutz, Anderson creates a believable setting using words like Sudeten and an ominous organization, the Zig Zag, symbolized by a ZZ. These subtle ques and Wes Anderson ability to create a unique world in extreme detail makes this a rich setting but the vague familiarity of it allows the viewer to concentrate on the story and the characters. With universal themes of discovery and coming of age presented in a fresh way and through the vivid expression of the director, this film waits patiently to be a classic for all time.",
893,7 March 2014,nazia000777,7, Anderson's overdecorated,"I can fully understand that Anderson's overdecorated, overstylized and highly self-conscious movies aren't for everyone, but at least some of the criticism rests on a faulty philosophical or aesthetic footing. Do movies made in a more naturalistic mode, like mainstream comedies and dramas with their formulaic three-act plots, actually do a better job of reproducing human relationships or social reality? What about movies set in outrageously artificial universes, like action films or thrillers, where we simply agree to overlook the fact that everything that happens is wildly implausible? To move the question to a larger frame, since when are the movies supposed to create a convincing simulacrum of reality?

Very good performances, taking the film clearly Ralph. Sublime address. Good soundtrack Good sound. As for its genre, I must emphasize something that seems essential to me: it has been cataloged to the film as a comedy ... but, it does not seem like a comedy, since although it wants to imitate and honor the film branch which Chaplin potentiated , it seems to me that it does not reach that level of comic range; Now, however, this work manages to generate a non-unique, but rare style: a surrealistically detective style, which catches during the hour and a half of the film.

920,7 February 2015,pgolato,6," The Grand Budapest, What a wild ride!","The notoriously quirky film director Wes Anderson strikes again with his latest academy award nominated film, The Grand Budapest Hotel. This film takes place in a fictional world set in the 1930's between World Wars and depicts the eccentric life of Gustave H (played by Ralph Fiennes), the hotels concierge and his sidekick known as lobby boy. As credit to Mr. Andersons talents he has assembled a star studded cast with brief appearances from major Hollywood actors such as Bill Murray, Jude Law, Owen Wilson, Edward Norton, and Willem Dafoe just to name a few. This film tells the humorous adventure story of a hotel concierge and his apprentice lobby boys' journey as they steal a priceless painting and attempt to outrun the many adversaries that try to get in their way. The underlying theme throughout this movie is bonding through mentorship. Although Gustave is not the best role model from a moral standpoint, he immediately sees himself in the young lobby by and takes him under his wing. Through their crazy adventures together they learn to rely on each other and eventually Gustave lets his young apprentice know how proud of him he is. Virtually every scene in this film ties back into the theme; these two characters are completely reliant on one another. A great example of this is the prison scene where lobby boy aids in Gustave's escape only to be lectured for not being prepared enough. Later in the film lobby boy saves the day when the pair sneak back into the hotel to retrieve their prized painting. While watching this film I am reminiscent of the theme in life aquatic (coincidently another Anderson film) where another corky character named Captain Zissou takes the crew under his wing for one last crazy journey teaching them along the way. Wes Anderson directs his films in a very unique way. The color used in this film is what really stood out to me as a viewer. Although this movie was a little dark in humor the colors were vivid and plentiful, perhaps purposely done to contrast the heavy parts of the storyline. The hotel itself is pink in a setting of a snowy and gray mountaintop town; this seems to underline the tone of the film perfectly. Another impressive technique in this film was the angles used. The director did a fantastic job of making the scary characters more daunting by shooting them from the ground up, specifically Joplin (Willem Dafoes character). The chase scenes made a very small man seem very scary by portraying him in dark colors and low angles giving off the appearance of extreme power and fear. In conclusion I feel this movie was very well directed and the storyline keeps the viewer interested. Although I don't care for this type of film it was interesting and at time hilarious. The theme stays consistent throughout this film and has a solid ending the leaves everyone happy.",

His most ambitious work yet, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is Anderson's magnum opus. At its core, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is the story of M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), famed concierge to the Grand Budapest. Anderson wastes no time in alerting the audience that while this is a story about M. Gustave, it is in no means his story. Leaping from the present, to 1985, then abruptly to 1968, and finally resting in 1932 the film is more than your typical frame story; rather a frame story contained within a frame story. So while M. Gustave remains the central figure throughout the bulk of the narrative, the film is equally Zero (Tony Revolori and F.

Ralph Fiennes and all the starry cast are excellent to watch; they really lean into the quirky nature of Wes Anderson's direction and Fiennes carries the main role with dexterous ease. The visuals are captivating and much different than the standard film, so much so that sometimes I missed what the characters were saying while I was busy taking in all the details of the scene. If you want a smile on your face, take this whirlwind tour through the history of the Grand Budapest Hotel.",
933,12 March 2018,sebastian_hawn,9, Shifts in Society and Ski Resorts,"In his latest film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Wes Anderson does an incredible job of telling an ugly story taking place in an even uglier time in a beautiful and light-hearted way. Receiving a 93% rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, The Grand Budapest Hotel is not only loved by fans, but also critically acclaimed. Taking place in the 1930s, the movie tells the story of a lobby boy, Zero, and his mentor, M.Gustave. M. Gustave manages a fantastical ski resort where he spends time meeting the needs of the hotel's old, rich, blonde occupants. Coming from zero, Zero is an immigrant who fled his war-ridden home to come to Zubrowka, the fictional European country in which the film is set.
 Alongside the adventures of Zero and M. Gustave is another story: that of the violent shift of culture in Western Europe during the World Wars. When the movie starts, it depicts a society of structure, nobility, and social hierarchy. From the beginning, Anderson portrays a hierarchy even within the hotel, with M. Gustave near the top, staying in a grand room with a grand bed, and Zero at the very bottom, living in a room the size of a closet. Everyone treats each other with respect, and everyone knows their place in society. Everything is structured. As the movie progresses, this theme is still apparent, yet things begin to change. For example, while traveling, Zero and M. Gustave's train is stopped in the middle of a barley field. It is then boarded by militarized police, who are seemingly ready to arrest Zero for lack of legal documentation. However, before they can do anything, they are stopped by their chief, who is a friend of M. Gustave's and gives Zero a note stating he is legally allowed in the country. This scene hints at the shift in the current society. At the end of the film, the plot makes it apparent that the shift in culture is nearly complete when a similar train scene is displayed, with Zero and M. Gustave's train car stopped again, but this time it is boarded by a stand-in for an SS death squad. Yet again, they are about to arrest Zero, but this time M. Gustave hands them the letter from their last barley field pullover. A member of the death squad proceeds to shred the note and bash Zero with the butt of his gun, symbolizing the near completion of the shift in society. 
 The beauty of the cinematography ude of a light-spirited sense of humor, although contrasting the ugly themes portrayed in the film, make the movie very charming. The excellent use of still and tracking shots, symmetry, colors, and beautiful sets allows for a stunning style of film that grants each shot an oil painting look. For example, at the beginning of the film, Anderson launches a colorful long shot of the hotel, giving a sense of its size and grandeur, followed by a tracking shot from the gondolas all the way through the resort, displaying the world it contains. Additionally, the humor is consistently subtle and funny, with skits ranging from the mysterious Society of the Crossed Keys, to the hunt for a strange yet priceless painting, Boy With Apple. The inclusion of humor and cheery tones in the film allow The Grand Budapest Hotel to be very enjoyable and fun to watch, even though the film tells a story of violence in a violent time.",

Ralph Fiennes performance is as unexpected as it is sublime but did this movie have me laughing out loud? No, it was just too silly to be funny. Entertaining yes but funny? No, despite fantastic performances from outstanding celebrity actors, it just missed my funny bone at every opportunity. Tony Revolori was outstanding in the role of Zero the resourceful lobby boy who is befriended and becomes the protégé of Gustave H legendary concierge at the famous European hotel. Cast in the role of 'straight' guy to Gustave's rather slapstick character, he plays it dead pan throughout. I gave it 5 out of ten because although entertaining, I didn't laugh out loud once despite expectations. So as entertaining if somewhat unusual fiction 8/10 but as a comedy 5/10",

948,25 April 2014,thomascorbett88,10, Masterpiece,"No amount of superfluous adjectives give justice to the magic and whimsical spectacle that is the Grand Budapest Hotel. A theatrical masterpiece for the age, its whit and insight that of ""Alice in Wonderland"" being a social blueprint of days gone past from an age characterised by crumbling aristocracy brought down by personal vendetta and political crossfire. The Grand Hotel is a beacon for not only simpler times but where careful thought and attention to detail never escapes the graceful eye of Wes Anderson.",
949,1 May 2014,submarine1977,8, Wes Anderson in a nutshell,"Wes Anderson possesses a completely rare among American filmmakers gift of having his own style of making movies. Even though plot of each of them is constructed very carefully, he treats all characters with equal dose of care. In fact, their peculiar personalities have become a kind of trademark of Anderson's storytelling. This feature could be even noticed in his Oscar nominated ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", which, even though had children as target audience, still managed to convey his characteristic style. Anderson's the latest movie is not an exception. ",
950,22 August 2015,aseemksh,8, The Grand Budapest Hotel,"All of Wes Anderson's films are cut from the same cloth; this is not an indictment of the talented filmmaker. He has a unique voice using which he leaves a very identifiable mark on his films. The quirky characters, the colourful dialogue and some very inventive camera-work make his films very recognisably his work. The Grand Budapest Hotel fits very nicely into his oeuvre and might possibly be his funniest film yet. It is at once a touching and at times a very goofy film that not only follows the Anderson aesthetic closely but allows the director to explore his creativity in a slightly edgier fashion. The film employs three different timelines each of which is presented with a different aspect ratio. We first meet a man simply called 'The Author' (Tom Wilkinson), who describes to us a story that was narrated to him by the mysterious owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel Mr Zero Mustapha (F. Murray Abraham). The old man tells the author the tale of how he came to own the Grand Budapest. He was a lowly lobby boy in that very hotel under the tutelage of the Hotel's colourful and quirky concierge Monsieur Gustave H., who has a habit of (ahem) socialising with the hotel's more affluent visitors. One such visitor with whom he was particularly close, Madame D is found dead under mysterious circumstances and it is revealed that she has left a valuable painting much to the chagrin of her scheming son Dmitri (Adrien Brody). Some secrets are revealed and Gustave and Zero find themselves in the midst of several entanglements and chaos ensues. Now, strictly speaking the Anderson's style is something that takes some getting used to for the uninitiated. But, he possesses the singular ability to populate every frame with offbeat imagery and to use the camera in such a way as to mine humour out of every scene. The way characters move, the manner in which certain scenes unfold makes the film visually very engaging. The dialogue follows in the footsteps of the film's visual chicanery. The interactions are once touching and often really funny. The only real problem is that at times all this whimsical wizardry gets in the way of the storytelling. This gives the picture a sense of being slight and this somewhat blunts the emotional impact of the story. The constant levity undermines the effect that the ending ought to have. While Anderson has been guilty of this before it has not been as apparent as it is here. Though, to be fair the aforementioned levity does impart the more violent and gratuitous scenes an irreverence that is refreshing. The romantic aspects of his stories have always been Anderson's forte and he handles it with a deft hand. Another interesting aspect of this production is the art direction. In an age where most filmmakers chose to go for either grand set designs or elaborate computer generated backdrops, Anderson has chosen to go in for old school painted backgrounds and some very cleverly employed miniatures that do an excellent job of creating the colourful world in which these characters reside. The camera-work and the background score complement the quirky tone of the script as well. The story takes place in a fictional European nation called Zubrowka in a World War II like setting and the efficient execution of these technical aspects makes this world come alive beautifully. Even though Zero is the one telling the story through The Author, Gustave H. is the focus of the story and Ralph Fiennes proves to be an inspired bit of casting. Much of the film's humour and all its key moments are made memorable by his excellent timing and screen presence. He brings to Gustave great poise and grace without sacrificing the humour. We see the younger Zero on screen for a lot longer than his older counterpart and for that part the director has chosen newcomer Tony Revolori. Even though there is nothing especially memorable about the young actor's performance he does an adequate job of engaging in some very funny and at insightful banter with his mentor. One thing that sticks out as just a tad conspicuously though is the actor's use of a posh American accent for a character that hails from a supposedly middle-eastern background. Adrien Brody as Dmitri de Goffe und Taxis plays a straightforward one dimensional villain. Though, the actor does have some fun with the role. Willem Defoe as his henchmen Jopling sees the actor bring a creepy menace to the role that is unsettling. The film has very large and diverse secondary cast with actors like Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Edward Norton occupying small roles that could easily be missed in the flurry of all the frenzy. The Grand Budapest Hotel does not quite hit the emotional highs of its maker's previous effort Moonrise Kingdom (2012). But it is still a solid effort from a man from whom his admirers (this author included) have come to expect a great many quirky cinematic delights and on that count The Grand Budapest Hotel does not disappoint.",

952,9 June 2016,cormacjohnkelly,9, Unique and Outstanding,"Wes Anderson is simply an incredible director that can turn an idea that may seem ridiculous and use it to create an awe-inspiring, visual masterpiece. Not only is every scene drenched in vibrant colours, but each shot is perfectly symmetrical so that every moment is aesthetically pleasing for the viewer. The characters are really brought to life in this film. The charming, poetic and self assured Gustave H is an archetypal Wes Anderson character, a lovable yet flawed man with a dead pan humour. I loved the subtle, dry humour of the film that blends nicely with the occasional fast paced scene. I have enjoyed a few of Wes Anderson's films over the past few years but ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is undoubtedly, in my eyes, the most defined film of his, with his exceptional casting and natural pacing of the film. This is a film that is often misunderstood, and seen simply as a comedy. But it is clearly much more than that. This is a carefully designed tale, with a blend of ridiculous hilarity and subtle wittiness, which form a visually captivating movie with a complex plot and a colourful array of characters. It was a pleasure to watch.",

The tracking shots are done really well too, as you go from one room to another. Lighting and colour play a huge part in how the audience is feeling on a emotional level, with scenes where lights go from bright to dark and bright colours visible throughout, that is until the final scene where it is shot in a singular symmetrical shot and in black and white.

It is a work loaded with a lot of elegance, distinction and finesse that contrast the unpostponable war, finally, the soundtrack goes completely according to each of the scenes proposed throughout the film and personally I must say that the unmistakable style of Anderson along with the Central European comic touch that manages to reflect make this a unique composition and very well achieved.",

It begins by a very serious introduction from the well spoken author, which is not really relevant to the story itself, but gives an idea of the movie itself - when the author is interrupts by the kids. Every episode in this movie contains/ends with a twist. Every twist will get you to smile. The name and the synapses of the movie is a little misleading; although the story is set originally in Budapest during the war, this is used only as a frame, and less as part of the adventure itself. The same events could take place at another time, at another place. This is not to say that the frame doesn't add to the storyline, it actually gives some beautiful heart-touching aspects. Although it's set at the beginning of the last era, the pace of the movie represents nowadays: fast, nonstop, keeps the watchers interested at all times - not a boring second. This is not the movie you check your phone during. Serious stuff happens there, but nothing is too big for the characters. Oh the characters!

989,12 December 2019,monty-47271,10, A fantastic movie of loyalty,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a fantastic movie filled with adventure, action, mystery and love. The movie focuses around two main characters M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and his lobby boy Zero Moustafe (Tony Revolori) and their adventures together and how they solved their problem. While watching the movie you may notice that the key theme through-out the film is loyalty. Wes Anderson (The Director) did an amazing job capturing this theme and presenting it in such a fun and entertaining way with his choice on angles and lighting.
While watching the movie unfold you cannot help but notice the lack of space on screen. Wes Anderson makes sure, in an intentional way, that everything on screen is being used and applied to the whole story of the movie. If you a seeing something happen in the background it is because Wes Anderson wants you to see and notice the event. The angles of The Grand Budapest are rather simple and straight forward but, executed in a brilliant way that does not interfere with the film or distract the viewer with too much. Most of the scenes are filmed head on to Gustave and Zero hiding most of the background or focusing on the main points of the story but, some scenes like the jail break scene intentionally use a different angle to show what is happening. It does not pull from the story it does not ruin the scene and it is fairly subtle and that is the genius of the angles in the movie. As for applying this technique to the theme of loyalty it is done with quite skill. Using the head on filming just the two Gustave and Zero it really helps build their bond for the viewer. We get to see them from the beginning where Gustave does not trust Zero as much it is filmed showing mostly their whole bodies. When we realize the theme of loyalty is when the film is showing the two closer together and more of their upper bodies and faces. That is really when we the viewer become engulfed in the fact that Zero would do anything for Gustave and vise-versa.
The Grand Budapest is filmed with a unique lighting that helps us the viewer know what to feel. At the beginning of film it hotel is dark and almost has a sad fog in it but, when Mr. Mustafe (F. Murray Abraham) is recollecting his journey with M. Gustave the hotel is very well lit and has a joyous feel to it. This lighting technique is used in practically every scene, if we are supposed to feel sad or disappointed then Wes Anderson made sure that the scene was darker and gloomier. This technique can also help enforce the theme in a simplistic but, very well done way: when Gustave and Zero are together the scene is brighter more happy feeling and when they are separated it is darker and gloomier. Eventually, Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) is introduced and she becomes loyal to Zero and when they are together the scene is brighter as well. Ralph Fiennes is no stranger to the lighting technique and a theme of loyalty. However, he is known for the dark lighting playing the bad guy, Lord Voldemort, in what could be his most famous movies; the Harry Potter films. The Harry Potter films share a common lighting style of darkness is sad and light means happiness the films also have a loyalty theme through-out all of them.",
990,8 May 2019,tuckerclark-97150,10, A time capsule you'll both regret and not regret,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is like fantasy, adventure, visual art, and a bowl of chicken noodle soup all distilled into one rollercoaster of an experience that leaves you with the feeling of waking up from a dream you wish you could return to. Wes Anderson is known for his cinematography and quirky stories, and whether you've been a Wes Anderson fan for years, or you're new to his work, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a solid pick.
The plot of the film revolves around Gustav H. (Ralph Fiennes), the head concierge at a very high-class hotel in the 1930's. The story is told from the perspective of Zero (Tony Revolori), a young refugee that is hired by Gustav as a lobby boy. After an elderly guest of the hotel meets her untimely demise, she wills a priceless painting to Gustav. Then begins a whirlwind of drama between the children of the women led by her son Dmitri (Adrien Brody), Gustav, and Zero as they try to track down a secret will and try to avoid being murdered by Dmitri's hired thug.
The story is exceptional, and a blast to watch unfurl for every second of the 110-minute runtime, but what makes The Grand Budapest Hotel truly unique amongst a sea of delightful and satisfying films is its cinematography. Many of the wide-angle shots in the movie, believe it or not, were created using sets built with miniature models, and then stylized further in post-editing. This type of set design and cinematography gives The Grand Budapest Hotel a truly exclusive feeling of warmth and surrealism.
When you put all the elements of the film together, though, it left me with a profound feeling of loss. It was a strange feeling to have after watching what had chiseled its way into my top three favorite movies of all time. A feeling like I may never again enjoy a movie like the one's which credits I was seeing scroll by. Then it hit me, while the shots were beautiful, the comedy sharp, and the PG-13 action was top notch, the whole story was really a story of loss.
The loss of a different time, further described by the opening shot in which a girl brings a book to a statue, in an obviously muted world. Then that statue is revealed to be an author, who wrote the story of Zero. These separate layers of storytelling ingrain the feeling that while you, the viewer, are experiencing the grandeur of Gustav H., its beauty, class, and wonder is firmly in the past, never to be experienced firsthand again. I felt the loss most painfully when the author was speaking to Zero in the time-scorched Grand Budapest that I'd learned to love, and listening to him regale losing Agatha, and losing Gustav. It was then, that I felt the true loss that The Grand Budapest is portraying.
A quote from Gustav, ""You see, there are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity."". Through the movie we come to know that Gustav represents this faint glimmer, and then we are forced to realized that faint glimmer that makes up every one of the many warm feelings stirred when watching the film, went out along with him. That made me feel a loss that I will carry with me for some time.",

With an excuse in 5 acts, and taking the theft of a painting, a man like Gustave H., the film gives us an extraordinary dissertation on the farce in which humanity lives (Metaphor of the Budapest Hotel). And Anderson opportunely labels it on several occasions with all the actantial models observed on the screen: Charge of childishness (the bellman), with his candid mischief (M.

Impeccable direction and photography, great performances and an incredible soundtrack. The film, although it is told in a comedy key, contains a lot of black humor, certain touches of brutality and a dose of surprise. Mixing genres as disparate as the prison, the love or the investigation, Wes Anderson tells us a way of living and thinking, crystallized in the character of Ralph Fiennes that seems to enchant him. It takes us back to a time and a way of life where elegance, manners, perfume, charm and good conversation mattered over the imminent war.",

Ralph Fiennes and F. Murray Abraham star as the legendary concierge and his pupil. Resulting in long, fast-paced scenes in which we watch them walking quickly through the ostentatious halls of the Hotel. Wes Anderson's sets are lovely as usual, his writing is fast and funny, it never feels bogged down by its subject matter, and the acting from the studded cast is superb, each actor and actress play there character exactly as they'd like, making it easier to like the characters themselves.

Thank you.,"Between the symmetrical scenery, the camera angle giving us the impression and feeling that we are there as well, the long forgotten character belonging to a true gentleman, and finding humor in such a horrid time, I believe Wes Anderson outdid himself. I always explain his work as being like a movie that you read or a book that you watch. It's difficult to explain unless you see the film for yourself. Others who know his work will understand completely. If you have a short attention span and are a part of the genre everyone keeps demanding the World to ""dumb it down"" for, than this film is not for you. It contains emotions from within a place of substance and wholesomeness. More directors need to aspire to regain the authentic outlook on life which Wes Anderson harbors.",

Really entertaining with everything from a prison break using hand tools to an exhilarating chase of a ski slope--really excellent and entertaining from start to finish. On the deeper side, this film analyzes how far one should go to do what's right versus what's convenient even when what's right could be deadly! It points to a life well lived by defending what's important (romance, reputation) against evil motivated by greed and jealousy. What's important to the central character at the end is not his ownership of a ruined hotel, but the memories that made it come alive for him earlier in his life and fortunately too for us in this film.",
1031,2 April 2014,trevmorelli,9, This was definitely something else (My 1st review),"(This is coming from a cinema lover who watches action, adventure, horror, drama and Independent films) Going into this movie I had no idea what to expect. When my friend asked me out to it I had no clue what the plot was, who was in it, or what the title even was. I recalled seeing one trailer for it a while back but it went over my head. Remembering the trailer this movie seemed to be nothing too special. But I was very wrong. I can happily say this movie is awesome. The Grand Budapest set itself apart from your common mainstream movies with a talented cast and a beautiful unique style. The first thing I noticed was that the movie is not shot for your typical widescreen theaters. This was completely square on the screen and that gave it a antique vibe right off the bat. The story is based on a book and having not read the novel I cannot touch on that subject but I will say I was weirdly immersed throughout. There are no explosions or action scenes to reel you in. The movie's pure style and class grab you by the balls and wont let go until the credits roll. Even then I wanted to sit in the theater and listen to the credit music. Despite the main cast shown throughout the movie big time actors held relatively small parts in this movie and I think that is another aspect that makes this viewing a real treat. An example is Bill Murray appearing for about 4 minutes with a short cameo performance. He didn't try to steal the show or take over the scene. A couple other big names came up in the same sense. The overall acting is great. A comedic touch is added and basically picks fun at past literature. A character will go on into a fancy quote and decide to give up on it interrupting themselves with a ""Oh f*** it"". The style, cast, and plot all tie together to create a chill, funny, eye opening and amazing movie. There is so much to love here and I cannot explain it all. This is a movie you must see for yourself. I definitely recommend if you want a different kind movie.",

1033,21 May 2014,hawkser36,10, great film,"Film director Wes Anderson creates his own world, full of colourful characters and nicely warm atmosphere. Every little detail and every set made me speechless. From lead character Gustave H.'s purple jacket to the title of the newspaper announcing the war. Anderson has given thought and attention to everything. The plot is not very important, because it is merely a vehicle for the stunning visuals, the dark humour and the rapid-fire dialogue. It's all about a hotel concierge, Gustave H., who is being chased by various villains for stealing a painting. Some of the scenes are very funny, but there is always a darker tone because of the war. Anderson doesn't shy away from extreme violence, but he shows it almost comical manner. Ralph Fiennes is acting as the Gustave H., who never despairs, even in the most unfavourable circumstances. He is supported by a large number of star actors, who are sometimes almost unrecognizable. Tilda Swinton gets rather little screen time, as does Harvey Keitel. Although, film director's choice of actors is fantastic and even side scenes are played very well. The plot is not always very easy to follow, and the dialogue is fast. There are the great camera angles and the wonderful detailed sets to pay attention to. I think by seeing the film a second time you can discover lots of things you didn't notice the first time. Both camera and sound operators did a great job, thats why film catches attention of audience. I would recommend this film for those who are searching for the film, that could change their world-view and make them laugh at the same time. It is fulfilled with irony and colour.",

Of course, you scream with laughter when you see the mix-up of all different East European cultures (East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Czech) but you just realize that it was created by an American, who does not know. For hell, the contrary. I am sure that he was fed from childhood with Mark Twain (the most European American author) and shat Kafka, Orkeny and Gombrowicz to name only a few great East European storytellers.

1035,18 February 2016,tgshore97,10, Beautiful Cinematography and Tremendous Screenplay,"I am a great admirer of how Wes Anderson and Robert Yeoman use different lenses and camera angles for each era, or just for different scenes. The emphasis of colours in this picture is remarkable, the most vibrant scene in my opinion would be the simple scene in the lift near the introduction. The red and the purple compliment each other brilliantly, I like pictures to be, not minimalistic, just not too overcrowding. I must have watched The Grand Budapest about 4 times, and yet, i still laugh at the sometimes bluntness of Gustave, or the will reading scene where the 'fighting' ends the scene. Marvellous. I have watched a few films in which Wes collaborates with Robert and the various group of actor that have been repeatedly included in productions, and they are mostly the same; artistic, exciting and original. The use of books in the film looks good, with a close up focus of books whenever they are seen shows great detail. The use of different era's at the start and end of the film gives real perspective.",

Everything was perfect with a nice touch of imperfection. What perhaps impressed me most was the color schemes and the set up - you must watch it to feel it. Every scene was a little work of art, so sophisticated and phenomenal. Each color, each item seemed to be there for a reason - they mixed and blended with each other very well. Good acting is counted tool. All characters were portrayed well, everyone in the movie had their own aura and colors that lasts. After months of watching it, it would be still possible to recalled who was who. In conclusion, this is a nice and short movie - a work of art that welcomes those who are fed up of the colorless and boring world out there. An classic adventure never do wrong.",
1039,25 January 2016,pdeluxe,8, An great piece of work,"I know it is hard for so many of you to be impartial after you have sung all the praises of Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums. But that is the joy of movies they speak to us differently. Personally I appreciated those earlier ones but have only truly come to love Anderson since Life Aquatic and Grand Budapest, this is truly one of my favorites. The framing in the cinematography was one of my favorite things here so rigid and fixed in every scene it was a character of it's own. The dryness and lack of any bold charisma by each of the characters was brilliant and lent itself to make you want to delve in and find more to pick out about each character. It has to be seen again and again to pick up all the subtle nuances. Personally I think he is gaining a maturity to his projects that is very appealing and somewhat missing in earlier works. ",
