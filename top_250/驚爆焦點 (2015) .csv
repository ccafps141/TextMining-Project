0,9 August 2016,planktonrules,10, It will leave you shaken....,"Before you consider watching ""Spotlight"", I STRONGLY urge you to think twice. It isn't because I think it's a bad film--it's amazingly good. But it's also a difficult film to watch--particularly if you or someone close to you has been a victim of sexual abuse. I know that in my case, it was particularly tough because I am a retired psychotherapist and used to specialize in working with sexual abuse victims and perpetrators...the latter, which, I think benefit very little from treatment (which is much of the reasons I changed careers).",/

But, it very often doesn't have any impact at all like in the case of movies like Dark Waters (Dupont) or Deepwater Horizon (BP) or Love & Other Drugs (Pfizer/Eli Lilly) or The Big Short (Banks) or Thank You For Smoking (Tobacco)... I'd like to think that this film had at least a measurable impact on society and more specifically, the amount of sexual abuse cases in religion... and that in itself, is commendable.",e

4,16 March 2016,miriam-seraia,10, A movie that qualifies as strong meat a.k.a. be ready to digest a lot of reality and face the true face of a world unknown to people living in a happy bubble.,"This movie undid something inside of me. It's that part of you that holds on to hope that people can be good, that there is hope for humanity. I knew the basics of it when I went to watch it: that it is about investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in the catholic church. And it uncovered so much more than just that. Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face of the world. We don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to the innocent. The little ones who can't protect themselves. When they are robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting in the film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front of me a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I was both shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably. ""Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us."" Indeed. When we witness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it, that's when we fail. A poet once wrote, ""You can join the millions talking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into the night."" So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicate the oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece. From the dedication of the actors to their roles, to the script, the director and the cinematography. The score? Fantastic. Howard Shore did it again!",i
5,28 November 2015,boatsfra,10, Fantastic Movie Filled with Sadness,"Going into the theater to see Spotlight, I had read the rave reviews and knew I was in for something special. This movie did not disappoint! Being from Boston, this movie really made me think about my life growing up, as a lot of ""what ifs"" came to mind. ""What if"" I went to church every Sunday...""what if"" I was gullible enough to have a priest lure me into his lair. Spotlight goes straight to the heart of this amazingly sad (and apparently never-ending) saga of the Catholic church and the amount of abuse priests have inflicted on hundreds of victims. The acting is all-around fantastic, from Mr. Keaton to some actors that I am not familiar with, which is an aspect of this fine movie that makes it so profound. Tense throughout, I was saddened to hear that this abuse is an epidemic and probably will never be stopped. The exclamation point was when a member of the audience stood up and told the rest of us ""...I am a survivor..."" WOW...",e

It's a still image of the principal cast hovered over a cluttered desk in a small room. It's not flashy, but still an incredibly effective piece of advertising.

8,28 February 2016,classicalsteve,10, All the Vatican's Men in Outstanding Investigative Journalism Film Revealing the Skeletons in the Boston Archdiocese's Closet,"In ""All the President's Men"", young reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered a national political scandal when they, through their investigative journalism, revealed the White House under then President Richard Nixon was using campaign funding to finance dirty tricks of political enemies, nicknamed Watergate. In ""Spotlight"", a similar team of investigative reporters reveal a scandal of epic proportions which makes much of the Watergate scandal seem tame by comparison. They uncovered widespread sexual abuse of minors committed by priests of the Roman Catholic Church who, in turn, hid the crimes. Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Walter V. Robinson (Michael Keaton), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Martin ""Marty"" Baron (Leiv Schreiber), Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) work for a group of investigative reporters within the Boston Globe called ""Spotlight"" who succeed in finding the skeletons in the Boston Diocese proverbial closet.

Possibly the Year's Best!,"Seconds after the credits for Tom McCarthy's ""Spotlight"" roll, an overwhelming feeling of changing your career takes over. Is film criticism really where I belong? What important, life-changing story am I not writing about? Truth is, quite a bit of classic films give off that same feeling. ""Rocky"" made a bunch of our fathers and older brothers go for a morning run and drink raw eggs. ""Rudy"" made us want to go out and play Notre Dame football. ""Spotlight"" makes you want to go down to your local courthouse and search the public records for clues. Then, get on the phone, with a pen and a pad, and start asking some really tough questions. Honestly speaking, ""Spotlight"" is the best investigative news drama this century. Matter of fact, behind ""All the President's Men"" and maybe ""The Insider,"" it's among the best ever made.",5
12,3 February 2016,brendandevere,9, Catholic Church in the Spotlight.,"Relevant, powerful and astonishing. Shocking, criminal and true. These are the only words to describe this film as it has literally put the 'spotlight' on the systematic cover-up by the Catholic Church of mass molestation and sexual assault acts performed by the priests in the Boston archdiocese that were trusted in the communities they represented. These 'men of God' preyed on the weak and vulnerable for years and the most powerful religious sect in the world did nothing but sweep it under the proverbial carpet.

The film follows The Boston Globe's ""Spotlight"" team, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative unit in the United States, and its investigation into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests. It is based on a series of stories by the real Spotlight Team that earned The Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.

15,21 November 2015,ThomasDrufke,10, Ignorance,"Tackling subject matter like Spotlight does is very difficult to portray on film. You have to accurately tell the story enough to not create outcry while also not relying on the weight of the source material in order to induce emotion. It's difficult, but certainly not impossible and Spotlight did pretty much everything right. The acting from one of the best ensemble casts of the year is phenomenal. Everyone gave such a great performance that no one ended up stealing the spotlight, pun intended.

19,28 February 2016,Hitchcoc,10," A Gem to Rival ""All the President's Men""","I finally saw this film a few hours before tonight's Academy Awards broadcast. I had a feeling that it had the chops to win the big one. Many of my friends have been touting it. It takes a truly skilled director and screenwriter to entice an audience to watch something where they already know the result. We are made aware of the foothold of the Catholic Church in the city of Boston. When a new news director comes on board, he feeds the need for an investigation into priest misconduct to the Spotlight team, a group of hard core reporters who are unyielding in their persistent investigation of whatever story is there. The beauty of this film is that at no time is there a sense of sensationalism. Yes, the church tries to cut them off at the pass and uses sealed documents as a weapon, but time is the issue as much as anything visible. Strong performances abound, but the characters have weaknesses and at times become a bit emotional over their task. This plays out with subtlety and an almost you-are-there sense. Loved this.",r
20,17 November 2015,PWNYCNY,10," Solid story, well acted.","Amazingly this is an excellent movie. It is amazing because in this day and age when Hollywood has opted to play up sensationalist glitz at the expense of substance, this movie does just the opposite. It tells a story. It does so in a straightforward manner, with no gratuitous scenes of violence or seedy sex. The story depicts a team of reporters who do a job, and do it right. They have some leads, develop their sources, collect the evidence, put it all together and publish a story. What they did took a lot of courage. Michael Keaton gives a strong performance as the leader of the team of reporters. However, it is Mark Ruffalo who emerges as the star of this movie. His performance dominates the movie. The subject of the story is controversial and sensitive. It deals with a religious institution that allows itself to become a cover for sexual perverts and then tries to cover up the mess, in the process deceiving the public. Sadly, but not surprisingly, this movie is based on a true story. That's why this movie must be watched.",e
21,31 January 2016,jtindahouse,7, A fine film but not worthy of winning Best Picture,"Going into 'Spotlight' I was aware that it was the front runner to win Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. After having seen it I can't really understand why. That's not to say it wasn't a good film, it simply didn't blow me away at all. It told a story, an admittedly fascinating and true story, in an informative way but it didn't do anything that great films do like inspire me, move me or leave me stunned with the powerful nature it was told with. Best Picture winners of the past, like 'Schindler's List', told true stories but also encompassed all three of those traits and plenty more. That was a film I will never forget, 'Spotlight' will probably be completely out of my mind by this time next week. Frankly, I was a little underwhelmed with the lack of emotion such a serious subject brought out in me. The film just didn't really seem to try to do that. It felt more like a documentary reenactment, simply with very fine actors, than anything else.",f

26,25 November 2015,meeza,10, Spot on!,"You spotlight up my life, you give me hope, to carry on... Sorry to get all Debbie Booneish on you in my intro on my review of the spectacular movie ""Spotlight"". Director Tom McCarthy's movie about the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese is shaking up to the be the frontrunner of the Best Picture Oscar, and why not? McCarthy's meticulous direction of the film and his layering of its expose was a sermonial, I mean a ceremonial piece of mastery. The Boston Globe's investigative ""Spotlight"" department shined on unveiling this disturbing truth. What was not disturbing was the exemplary acting performances from the actors playing the ""spotlight"" write players; including Mark Ruffalo as the emotional Mike Rezendes, Rachel McAdams as the conflicted Sacha Pfeiffer, Brian D'arcy James as the cerebral Matt Carroll, and the ""Birdman"" himself Michael Keaton as the group's leader Robby Robinson. Keaton and Ruffalo were the standouts here, but all should be given the proper spotlight for their commendable acting. Other fine thespian turns came from Stanley Tucci as the counsel Mitchell Garadebian, Liev Schrieber as the paper's new editor Marty Baron, and John Slattery as the associate editor Ben Bradlee. It will be very sad if this acting group does not get the SAG Best Acting Ensemble Award. McCarthy's script with fellow screenplayer Josh Singer had all of the write stuff of a multi- dimensional narrative covering an uncomfortable subject matter. Sure, the film does depict journalists as literary superheroes, but their procedural process workings was their greatest weapon to get rid of the darkness of the subject they were investigating; and it isn't that what superheroes do? or something like that? Anyways, I pray that ""Spotlight' receives many Oscar nominations, as it should. So, it's now time for you to see and then share the ""Spotlight"". ***** Excellent",_
27,15 May 2016,Horst_In_Translation,6," Very relevant and important, but not very good","""Spotlight"" is an American movie from last year that runs for slightly over 2 hours and was written and directed by Tom McCarthy. It won two Academy Awards earlier this year, including the grand prize for Best Picture. And the reason for this is probably that it is about a really important subject, namely the way it was discovered by a major newspaper that pedophilia was something that existed on a larger scale in the Church, despite many attempts of the latter to keep it disclosed. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams managed Oscar nominations for their supporting performances. I cannot say I agree with either sadly. McAdams played her part well, had a couple good moments, but I don't think it was one of the best of the year in her category. Probably more of a coattail nomination, I remember it was also pretty surprising she got in. Ruffalo's nomination was no surprise, he got in at all the precursors too. But I had sometimes problems with his performance. It seem over-the-top theatrical and it had a touch of one man against the Church at times, which went entirely against the idea of the team collaboratively managing great things. I am usually a fan of Ruffalo and he has good moments here too, but I think a mix of not so good writing and perhaps not the best approach to the role may have hurt the character. Keaton, Tucci, Slattery and Schreiber are pretty much the same, good but not great, but probably on par with the two nominees. It was a team effort and nobody really stood out. Seeing these names now I kinda think it helped McAdams with her nomination that she was the only female from the bunch.",u

29,7 December 2015,Quinoa1984,10," script and performances is all, and that's enough","With a movie like Spotlight, the one thing you can say against it is that it's not particularly showy. We won't remember the movie this year let alone years from now for its cinematography (though perhaps its lack of being 'showy' or really darkly lit or stark in contrasts is its own visual statement). This isn't to say that Tom McCarthy doesn't so his job as a director in an elemental sense; he does get some good shots (there's one where the camera simply backs up as a crucial statistic is laid out by the ex-priest turned therapist who gives the Spotlight reporters what they need to move forward into the bigger picture of their story, and it works beautifully). But what he does is put together the best cast possible - Keaton, Ruffalo, John Slattery (as Ben Bradley Jr, which I'll touch on in a moment), Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, and even Richard Jenkins as the voice on the phone - and makes sure that they're all on a level where no one ever upstages another.

33,14 November 2015,chicagopoetry,10, Right Up There With All The President's Men,"Mark Ruffalo definitely deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of an investigative journalist so in love with his job that the only exercise he gets is jogging to work. He nails it with such sincerity that he left me feeling like I was feeling what he was feeling. I don't know if his role would be considered best actor or best supporting actor-- seems the Academy decides that by a flip of the coin. Michael Keaton does a fantastic job but this time around it's Ruffalo, the best I've seen from him ever, hands down. Rachel McAdam's puts the powerful female character wasted in the utterly confusing True Detective Season Two to better use as another member of the investigative team. And the rest of the cast is nothing short of brilliant and convincing. This is one of those rare movies that can build almost unbearable suspense with not much more than phone calls and note taking. What makes this such a nail biter is just simply how realistic it's all portrayed. You REALLY feel like you're in that newsroom; you REALLY identify with each of the characters and understand what they are going through and the stakes involved. This is one of those gems like Glengary Glenn Ross that will have you on the edge of your seat even though there isn't a single bullet fired, explosion, killing or action sequence whatsoever.

37,5 January 2016,zetes,7, Pretty bland,"Mmm, might make my top 50 of 2015. It's a perfectly good movie about investigative journalism, and it's interesting to see the process of journalists, but it's extremely pedestrian filmmaking and has like zero insight into the subject at hand (which is the cover-up of priest molestations). Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and Brian d'Arcy James play the Spotlight team at the Boston Globe. They're all good, but, except for one big moment with Ruffalo, none of them do anything exceptional. The Globe's new editor, Liev Schreiber (somewhat more interesting, but not much), decides to follow-up on some earlier stories about the subject he thinks are incomplete. The best performance in the film belongs to Stanley Tucci, who plays a lawyer for victims. The second best belongs to Neal Huff as the leader of a victims' organization. Both Huff and Tucci are angry that the Globe is just now getting interested in the story. I think even critics in Boston know that Mad Max: Fury Road is a better film than this. Maybe some day the Spotlight team can uncover that conspiracy.",

39,21 April 2016,brchthethird,10, A compelling and sobering portrait of investigative journalism,"Did SPOTLIGHT deserve to win Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards? Maybe, I guess. I still haven't seen all of the nominees yet, but even still I recognize that SPOTLIGHT is an excellent film. Based on true events, it tells how the Boston Globe broke the story about a massive cover-up of pedophile priests in the Catholic Church. It also features an incredible ensemble cast who, although not given much to do individually, work great together in service of a very compelling (and saddening) story. Out of the five actors given top billing, I would say that Liev Schreiber and Mark Ruffalo fare the best, although the rest of the cast don't slouch by any means. Rachel McAdams is perhaps the weakest out of the bunch, but even she mostly holds her own. Far and away, the most important takeaways are the devotion to pursuing the truth no matter where it leads you, as well as the integrity necessary in investigative journalism. Some people have called this the greatest journalism movie since ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, but I still need to see that in order to make such a comparison. Briefly touching on other matters, I thought the score and cinematography were quite adequate enough to elevate this beyond something that would normally play as a made-for-HBO movie. In particular, I liked the use of substantial tracking shots, which visually reinforced the winding and interconnected paths that the Globe's spotlight team go on in pursuit of their story. Ultimately, there is a lot in here that could shake one's faith in humanity and human institutions, particularly religion, however I never felt like they demonized anyone. It merely acknowledged the imperfections and, some of the time, willful negligence of said institutions and the communities they serve, while also aspiring to better accountability in both. Best Picture winner or not, SPOTLIGHT is hands down one of the best that 2015 had to offer.",

The main problem is that the Catholic Church just doesn't come across as a particularly forceful adversary. We're told that the Church is so powerful and has kept the abuse hidden for decades, but when a group of reporters actually goes digging they encounter some roadblocks but nothing that gives you the sense that the Church was something to be feared. While I didn't necessarily need Cardinal Law to dispatch some Opus Dei goons to discourage the reporters and the victims, the movie would have been more rewarding if they'd encountered much stronger resistance from the Church, public officials, and their own family and friends.",
48,2 January 2016,phd_travel,5, The reporter's point of view isn't that interesting,"This is a movie about the sex abuse scandal by Catholic priests in Boston. It is a movie that should have been made properly since abstract headlines don't tell a lucid story. However, making it from the point of view of the Boston Globe journalists simply isn't that interesting. It should just have been one of the aspects of the movie but not the main one. More emphasis on the victims and families, some major perpetrators, high ranking clergy actually doing the cover up etc could have been shown. After all, the reporters are not the main players in this tragedy. A more complete picture like in ""And the Band Played On"" would have been better. Difficult to keep track of who all the lawyers and reporters are.",

This film shows how professional journalists work to uncover a tremendous story â€“ said professionalism so sadly lacking in today's media world - with hard work, dedication and honesty. How finding out the truth and exposing it was crucial to bringing hard to grasp facts to the focus of the entire world. I see Oscar winners written all over this picture. Best Picture right on to Best Male Actor â€“ and two of them should be nominated here, Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton. Terrific performances by both. This movie moves right along, bringing it all together in a way that almost numbs your mind by the time it's done. When the end credits roll and it shows how this single story brought out atrocious child molestation scandals, not only in America, but all over the world, and you see the long, long list of places, you can hardly manage to get up from your seat and walk out into the world. You are stunned. This is not a spoiler, but I have to say, at one point in this film, without a word spoken, you watch the camera scroll down pages of names and facts, and in the background you hear a chorus of innocent young voices singing a Christmas carol, the hair on the back of your neck risesÂ….you KNOW you are watching something brilliant. And that's what this production is, brilliant. Without question one of the best pictures you will ever see. And the one that will have you thinking and talking about it for a long, long time after.",

The Romans are documented to be 10 times more insidious and successful in terrorizing our Homeland than Trump's scapegoat Muslims (a.k.a., ""the usual suspects"") in SPOTLIGHT. Half of ALL Roman priests ignore their ""sacred"" obligatory celibacy vows to enjoy sexual intercourse, SPOTLIGHT shows, and between 6% and 18% are sexually abusing defenseless young children (the lower figure is given early in the film, but the higher ratio is used right at the close, when more facts are in). The end credits for SPOTLIGHT itemize that nearly EVERY major city of the ""Western World"" as being corrupted by this plague of ecclesiastical terrorism, 99% of which STILL is being swept under Rome's rug. Boston (a.k.a., ""The Devil's Playground,"" as documented earlier this year in BLACKMASS) is Ground Zero for America's nefarious malignant cancer, SPOTLIGHT illustrates. This flick suggests that the Roman cabal conspirators tried to quash the scandal from becoming widely known to the Public by using its pawns at Boston's Logan Airport and their Roman counterparts in New York to usher the 9-11 hijackers onto four airliners (in an effort--so far successful with Trump and many other benighted Americans--to divert attention from the REAL domestic terror threat ripping the fabric of U.S. civilization).

There are lots of regrets and many speculations that this team is working to bring light to. Michael Keaton heads the operation hoping to convince old colleagues to reverse their previous decision and right previous wrongs. Mark Ruffalo has fun with a rookie role where he saunters about trying to get an attorney, played by Stanley Tucci to allow him to interview past victims. Tucci would prefer that the emotional wounds of these victims not be opened but he soon comes to terms with the importance of not having these incidents happen in the future. Rachel McAdams plays another journalist who is determined to break this story but often meets with rejection. At one point she even has a former priest admitting his wrong until his sister warns her away. Liev Schreiber plays a new arrival who first opens this story up. Director Tom McCarthy handles the film in similar vein as All the President's Men or The Paper with realism in the sets and locations with a touch of paranoia thrown in. The subject is sensitive and controversial but perhaps the film deals this subject because it is handled very discreetly in reality. Now it is given the spotlight it needs to bring the guilty to justice and the victims closer to closure. Score: 10 / 10",
61,25 February 2016,PrashunChakraborty,7, A good docu-drama but nothing more,"I liked this film, thought it was a well done solid film. But I am afraid I can't say anything more than that, it is very documentary like which can be it's biggest strength (a very fact driven plot heavy film) or it's biggest weakness (characters feel cold and distant and other than the plot nothing really impresses, also quite bland in the visuals department). However the characters do start to show some life nearing the end of the film but by that time damage is done it can be hard if not impossible for viewers to differentiate between the reporters for nearly one and a half hour of the film, they all suffer from different faces but same objective syndrome and inadequate effort is made to separate one from the another. Also speaking of run-time, this film is a wee bit over two hours long, editing especially in the first half could have made this film a bit crispier. However I did like the accuracy level in the film regarding the cellphones, ads, electronics and the cars used in 2001; a lot of films these days are becoming very careless in this regard. I would compare it to last year's Foxcatcher another fact driven docu-drama film, solidly acted, but nothing special in the direction, editing and cinematography department, I would still recommend it but no way this film deserves a second watch, you can absorb everything there is to get in a single viewing. All in all, a solid well written docu-drama which will have it's time in the ""spotlight"" (pun!) this Oscar season and will become ""oh that movie about pedo priests"" by next year's Oscar season.",
62,21 November 2015,pefrss,10, I have no faith that priests can live without sex,"This is a well made, well acted movie. Worth while seeing. Reading the reviews there is one review which claims that the story was really broken by Kirsten Lombardi working for an alternative Boston paper called Phoenix. She does not get any credit in this movie. I have found often that these alternative papers dig out a good story and because they do not have the resources of big newspapers are not able to follow up the same way. Nowadays there is not much money for investigative journalism anywhere. Everything is owned by a few corporations who impose their agenda on the news staff, which is very sad and worry-some. This movie also shows that journalists embedded in a community may not question thoroughly those which have been their friends since childhood and who may threaten their survival in that community. It sometimes takes an outsider to force the spotlight on things. That became evident in the journalist played by Michael Keaton. First I suspected that he might have been molested himself, but then it turned out that he had ignored the story twenty years prior though it was served to him on a platter. In this respect the movie was well rounded and realistic. It is also realistic about the abuse children had to suffer by priests. I was raised Catholic, I never encountered an abusive priest during my childhood. But there were plenty of indications that priests were suspected to have sex. With their housekeeper or with devoted church ladies. I remember people making jokes about it and finding it okay. In my personal opinion I consider it abuse that the Catholic church forces priests and nuns to live a sexless life. It is against nature and obviously nature takes revenge. If priests and nuns could marry the Catholic church would probably not have such a huge shortage of people willing to serve. I have left the Catholic church the moment I legally could. As a woman I saw no role models and no place for me. I looked at all the other religions in this world and decided that none of them appeals to me. Religion may be a comfort to some people, but it also seems to be the breeding ground for so much hate and so much violence. So for decades I have lived happily without religion or faith. A strange thing happened to me and a few dozen of other movie go-ers while trying to see the movie. We were informed by the theater management that they could not show the movie because they did not have permission. We were refunded and offered to see other movies instead. This was a first for me in decades of movie going. I ended up seeing this movie in a different theater run by a different company, they obviously had permission",

""What arraignment?"", replies the other cop. We then fast-forward to ""July, 2001"", and we get to know the 4 member Spotlight, an investigative reporting team at the Boston Globe. The Globe also has just gotten a new editor, Marty Baron, ""an unmarried Jewish guy who doesn't like baseball"" (the implication being he's no fit for Boston). But it's not long before Baron picks up on a recent column about abuse by Boston priests, and he orders Spotlight to look into it.

It's supported and held together by an all-star and all pro cast of film veterans like Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, and John Slattery. The film is based on the true and real life story of the Boston Globe's investigation into the uncovering of the massive scandal of the cover- up that the local catholic Archdiocese did within the city. And this would involve the abuse and sexual molestation of mostly young boys. As one by one older men start to remember and recount the gone by years that they were prey and taken advantage of by high ranking religious figures of the church as it's revealing to see how the young, innocent, and lonely are hit so hard. Upon the the investigation by the newspaper team it is found how the cover-up was at all levels from not only just the church but in the form of the legal system and local and federal government as the cases were often kept quite or thrown out or settled out of court. Along the way the team does draining work of digging for information and asking questions of the high powered in the city as Robby(Michael Keaton)the lead hunter and Sacha(Rachel McAdams)are the tag team of reporters that gather the most revealing information. Overall this picture is informative and investigative as it does shed light on scandal and corruption showing that the powerful must be held accountable and it proves that religious leaders are often a massive greed scandal and a work of moral decay as the hierarchy loves to abuse their power and authority. Overall ""Spotlight"" is a real eye opening film that searches and finds answers as it's a showcase of accountability proving that light must be shined on those in power.",

Just scene after scene of people in varying states of agitation either reading or speaking. Compare this to a movie like Steve Jobs (2015) which is also very dialogue heavy and note all the various ways in which Boyle and crew aid their dialogue through camera movement, interesting angles and shadowing, etc. It makes you realize how thoroughly uninteresting Spotlight is in that particular way.

He had seen it before and didn't mind going again while I was just experiencing this for the first time. No graphic scenes but many of the victims didn't mince words when describing what happened to them at such young ages so I either covered my mouth or hit the chair, not too hard, when those were revealed. Visually, this probably wasn't as impressive as another Best Picture nominee-The Revenant, for instance-but it was riveting enough dramatically, otherwise, for me and perhaps for my friend, as well.

I'm calling it now. I was very excited to see it because I love Michael Keaton and last year's Birdman was so bizarre. Plus this seemed to be the type of film that could only be great with a great cast and an incredible, disturbing and important subject matter. Spotlight is fascinating. It's at least as good as Trumbo was but the problem with this and Trumbo is that both films were just good. Spotlight is based on the horrifying story of a team of reporters at the Boston Globe who single handedly uncover one of the biggest cover-ups in history of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. It's interesting, it's well acted but it's far from great. The pace is good, nothing gets in the way of the main story and there are strong performances from an ensemble cast. No one really ""stars"" in the film but rather everyone works at driving the important story. I felt like from an entertainment perspective it wasn't necessarily thrilling but it does tell the story decently. To me a Best Picture nominee should have all their ducks in a row and Spotlight doesn't really fit that bill for me being just ""good."" ",

An important story."" In 2001 the Boston Globe newspaper was in transition. A new editor was brought in and budget cuts were coming. The team of the Spotlight section has just been given a new story to work on. The story deals with allegations of child abuse within the Catholic Church. What started off as a story with a few victims with one priest began to grow the more they dig. By the time they ran the story the victims and the number of priests grew to disgusting numbers, but it didn't stop there. This is a movie that makes you sick while you watch. This is another movie were everyone knows the outcome but that does nothing to make you furious with anger and want to scream at the TV. I don't want this to become too political or controversial so I won't go any further but I will say this is a movie you MUST WATCH. This movie is important and transcends the screen into true journalism and continues this needed conversation. I have seen 6 of the 8 Best Picture nominees for this year so far.

78,16 January 2016,ironhorse_iv,9," This based on true events, movie deserves all the spotlight, it has been getting. It's a well-made superb film.","In the midst of the chaos of the first year of the new Millennium, a new editor-in-chief Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) hope to shakes things up more at The Boston Globe when he re-assigns the paper's ""Spotlight"" team of reporters; Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) to dig up an old story about a local priest. Led by editor, Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Michael Keaton), the team uncover more than one story, but a massive child molestation scandal within the city's Catholic Churches that would bring the issue of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests into the national limelight. Directed & co-written by Tom McCarthy, Spotlight is able to show the power of investigative journalism, and how a small group of journalists were able to take on, a large social entity. Because of that premise alone, the movie kinda remind me, a little bit of 1976's film, All the President's Men with its all-star cast. The main actors that make up, this small group are amazing. Each one of them, really did shine, but if I had to pick, two, it would be Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo. Both really put, most of their emotional weight in this film. There are also strong supporting characters in this movie that it makes many of the minor scenes, very appealing to watch, but if I had to showcase some, I would pick character actors like Stanley Tucci & Billy Crudup. The reason why, I felt they were awesome in their small roles, is because they really did seem like lawyers with hidden agenda to the best degree. Its characters like them that made the film, so engaging. Because of that, the film feels like it hardly has any slow and tedious moments. But if I had to pick a slow moment, it would be any scene dealing with Boston College High School. I found those scenes to be, a bit too controversy and turn-offish to be, worth watching. Still, for the most part, I love how the film delicately balances its focus on giving the story somewhat room to breathe and the survivors their voice. The music by Howard Shore add to it, with its tone of feeling of disgust with a mix of hope. However, some parts of the film, can be a bit confusing with the limited exposition and somewhat rushed, due to the quick pacing. A good example for me, is how I got confused, between dialogue talking about Cardinal Bernard Francis Law (Len Cariou) and that of, Canon Laws. I really didn't know, who or what, they were talking about. There are plenty of dialogue full scenes like that, where a few names, local places, judicial process, and historic events are said by characters that might go over many moviegoer's head. While, I found the movie, somewhat engaging because of the dialogue, I think a little research on the subject matter, beforehand, would help, make sense of it, for the viewer, when watching this film. But if you can't find time to do that, and you going to watch this movie, pay close attention to ever detail in this film because there will be stacks, and stacks of information that your mind has to wrap around. The astrosphere for the film was also great. You really get that feeling, of change, going around. You really do sense, the end of newspaper business with this film with how outdated, some of their methods are. I just love, the details of seeing tons and tons of papers folders, scatter around the office and the journalist calling from, flip phones. It shows the industry in its last hurrah, before getting crush under the weight of online v-blogs, interactive media, & conversation threading. Small talks in the film about how the internet will change, how journalism is run, is amazing to hear. The same with the church; you really get the sense, that social institutions like that, are losing its control on the people. Just ask any Christian today, and you will see more and more people are not as devout, as they use to be. A lot of strong Christians, are even lapsing or questioning, what does it means to a man or woman of the faith. As more and more information is available through the internet, it's easier to see the hypocrisy that Church for so long, try to hide. Indeed, this is the informative age. For the most part this movie is very accuracy to the events that came to be. While, researching for this review, I couldn't find much to couther this. Overall: While, this movie is a bit predictable, much of film's massive appeal, go primarily to the stellar cast, and the screenwriter Josh Singer, who approached the subject matter with palpable and empathy, care. While the movie is Rated R for some language including sexual references, Spotlight is surprising, not that overly graphic. You don't see, any graphic sex scenes, here, just adults talking about how, when they were children, they got molested. It wasn't too much of a turn-off. In the end, while Spotlight isn't for everybody; it's a film worth watching if you get the chance to. After all, horrible things like child molestation must stop.",

80,18 November 2015,jmoneyjohal,10," A thought provoking film, about uncovering some hidden truths. 2015's best film till now, its realistic cinema at its best.","Faith, religion is at times is the most powerful thing a person has, faith at times can regulate a persons whole life,some peoples whole life is just about god, and these people look up to certain god men, them being priests, popes etc but at many instances we see these men take advantage of there power and place, and do things that are unmentionable. Spotlight highlights these unmentionable acts that many churches were hiding to keep there dignity intact. I am not questioning any religion, but what these priests did in 2001 (and before and after that time) was absolutely sickening. Spotlight is based on a true of how priests across America but specifically the Boston area, tracing back to the the 1960s sexually assaulted children from the ages of 5-13. These Roman Catholic/Christian priests of Boston/America were supposed to spread the word of peace and goodness of the lord, but they took advantage of there power and did something unforgivable. Spotlight is one of those rare films that completely shocks you, makes you think, and leaves very uncomfortable. Spotlight is realistic cinema at its best, this is one of those most superior films I have seen this year, its a film that makes the viewers feel uncomfortable, mad, and in it will move you to tears.

Tom McCarthy's (""The Cobbler"") Spotlight, however, reminds us of what it was and what it still could be. Set in Boston, the film is named after the Pulitzer Prize winning investigative unit of The Boston Globe which, in the years following 9/11, investigated the abuse of children by parish priests and the link of silence that existed between the Catholic Church and the Boston political and business community. It was a silence that allowed offending priests off the hook for their crimes, being transferred from parish to parish where they often re-offended.",

More than that, it points the finger at the shoulder-shrugging complicity of other areas of the establishment like the law courts, police and the press, including the paper's own earlier self, burying previous isolated reports on the subject deep in the paper without thought of following up the bigger story. Indeed it takes the arrival of a new editor at the paper to revive the story which he does by setting loose its specialist four-strong investigative team known as Spotlight on the case, where they soon find substance to the rumours and fight to bring it to light.",
84,2 September 2018,sddavis63,10, A Powerful Story That Will Anger Those Who Watch It,"This is a difficult movie to watch - a movie that will make you truly angry, even if you aren't Catholic. It details the work of a group of investigative reporters with the Boston Globe in the late 1990's and early 2000's to expose the sexual abuse scandals of the Roman Catholic Church in Boston. Now, today, we hear so much about the sexual abuse of minors by priests that I fear we've become hardened to it. It doesn't seem to shock us anymore. But at that time most of this was unknown to most people - covered up by Church officials who just kept moving pedophile priests from parish to parish and settling with abuse victims out of court to protect the image of the church; used by lawyers who presumably made a comfortable living off the negotiated settlements; swept under the carpet by officials ranging from police officers to judges who turned their eyes away because they were Catholic themselves; ignored or minimized by the media when stories did leak out. It's a story about an out of control institution and the power of the Roman Catholic Church - not a wild eyed conspiracy type of story, but a raw, down to earth story about what was (and is) essentially a conspiracy to try to get the Church off the hook for the abuse committed by its clergy.

114,4 December 2015,vsks,10, Master Class in Telling a Story That Makes the Viewer Care,"Shades of Woodward and Bernstein, the based-on-a-true story Spotlight follows the actions of an investigative journalism team way out on a limb in Catholic Boston. They're not just in pursuit of the story of clergy child sex abuse, their mission is also to expose the shameful cover-up of abusive priests, and the institutional shortcomings that allowed them to carry on. Unlike today's social media blowhards (and political candidates), they can't just make accusations; they need actual proof. A nice coincidence is the support the reporters receive from another Ben Bradleeâ€”this one Ben Bradlee, Jr., played by John Slattery, who never has a good hair day. Like his father in the Watergate era, he lets the reporters run, even though he's initially skeptical they'll come up with anything. Crusading journalists are a social corrective we have largely lost in the era of declining newsroom budgets and staffs and the competition for sound bites and snarky bits. The reporters in this film reporters fill the job description, pushed by a fierce desire to expose the truth. Sometimes, of course, that leads to more truth than they might desireâ€”closer to home truths of different kinds. They're after the kind of story that wins Pulitzers, but more important to the journalists, they know it's an important story for the affected families and a sobering story about how evil can hide in plain sight. The principals include the Boston Globe's new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) and his investigative ""Spotlight"" team, led by Robby Robinson (Michael Keaton of the pursed lips), with reporters Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo, who sticks his head out like a turtle, so eager is he to grab onto the story), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachael McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian D'Arcy James). The actors do a fine job, as do Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup in smaller roles. As written by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer and directed by McCarthy, the film is a ""magnificent nerdy process movieâ€”a tour de force of filing cabinet cinema,"" says Justin Chang in Variety. Yet it is never uninteresting. Even better, it is never sanctimonious. The film's tension comes from fear that the Church will find out what the Globe is up to and exert its considerable influence to put a stop to it orâ€”and almost worse from the reporters' point of viewâ€”the Boston Herald will scoop them. If they can delay publication until they have proof top Church leaders knew about the abuse, it would be impossible for them to persist in the ""few bad apples"" claim. In sum, ""A taut story, well-told,"" says Jim Lane in the Sacramento News & Review.",

With subject matter so infuriating and gut-wrenching, it would have been easy for writer-director Tom McCarthy to create a good versus evil arc and give the audience a clear-cut bad guy to despise and deplore. But McCarthy opts for a more intelligent route and keeps the individual offending priests faceless (barring one unsettling and revelatory scene), instead homing in on the atrocities committed by the institution. Unravelling like a journalistic thriller sans the glee, Spotlight is an insightful, methodical and utterly compelling film that provides a window not only into the earth-shattering monstrosities at its core, but also into the mechanics and minutiae of old-school reporting. Understanding that the interactions between the key players is critical to maintaining a level of reality in what would otherwise seem completely unbelievable (despite being true), McCarthy keeps his direction unflashy, allowing the high calibre cast to flourish. Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Brian d'Arcy James, Live Schreiber, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci are all at the top of their games with fleshed out and layered performances that favour subtlety over grandstanding. Spotlight is a brilliantly told true story that captivates from beginning to end, deserving each of its six Academy Award nominations and a place on everybody's must-see list.",

121,23 November 2015,aciessi,9, All the Archdiocese's Men,"The front-runner for Best Original Screenplay in just about every award show this year is Spotlight. the riveting, frighteningly accurate story about the cover-up and exposure of the pedophilia scandal that nearly destroyed the Catholic Church during the 2000's. As the statistic was at that time, nearly 6% off all catholic priests in the world were accused of sexual assault. Yes, it's far too painful to want to believe, but this is true. A noticeable amount Catholic priests were guilty of this, and many more may exist to this day. The truth is, these things happened, and the Church did next to nothing to stop it. It caused many people, like myself, to become lapsed Catholics, and some became not religious at all. Thus, Spotlight, a film about journalism, is a microcosm of journalism in itself. It's the truth that you don't want to hear, but you really should hear. Tom McCarthy brings the story to life with an unbeatable cast. The standout star is Mark Ruffalo, who in this, gives a raging monologue that has easily sealed him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The best scenes are, without a doubt, the interviews with the survivors. You'll be left stunned, that's all I have to say right now. There's not a moment of drag in this picture. Spotlight hooks you in to the very last frame. It's screenplay is the heart of it all. It reaffirms you how intelligent a film can truly be. If this doesn't win any awards for Best Original Screenplay in the coming season, I'd be flabbergasted. Spotlight absolutely delivers as an engaging drama, a loud advocate of free speech and a relentless call for criminal justice everywhere.",

Reality is often depressing and this film is a reminder of that, but rather than letting abuse continue, the Spotlight team steps up and fights for what's right to save others moving forward and bring justice to those who suffered from abuse in years past. This movie will leave you shaken, but it is a necessary film and a very deserving best picture winner. I don't think it is among the top tier best picture winners, but still a very good movie. I remember seeing this when it first came out in 2015 during the award season, hoping The Revenant would win best picture, but 7 years later watching it again, I fully understand why this won best picture and it was the right choice. Lastly, the ensemble in this film is tremendous. Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo and Liev Schreiber in particular were all fantastic. There is a scene towards the end with Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton that is just outstanding, Ruffalo will undoubtedly receive an Oscar one day. Spotlight is a well done, yet devastating film with a fantastic cast. I recommend this film to anyone that is looking for an important film based on a true story.

123,8 December 2015,cultfilmfan,10, Spotlight,"Tom McCarthy's new film Spotlight is sure to be one of the most talked about and perhaps even one of the most controversial films of this year. The true story of a group of newspaper writers and their editors who decided to expose the vast number of cases involving sexual abuse within the Catholic church. This is a film that is extremely powerful to watch and while you are watching the film it affects you deeply because of the sensitive subject matter that it is dealing with and also because what these writers are uncovering is extremely disturbing and sure to leave you feeling uneasy and even perhaps a bit nauseated while watching the film. The fact that all of this is based upon true events that did not just occur over a short period of time, but spanning decades and perhaps even longer than that and the fact is that unfortunately the types of abuse documented and reported upon in the film are still happening to this day. The film takes place in Boston, Massachusetts and while a lot of priests and members of the Catholic church were uncovered there, it unfortunately doesn't just stop there, but spans all across the United States as well as pretty much all corners of the world. To my knowledge with the release of this film, I have not heard, or read about any backlash, or negative comments from the Catholic church regarding the matter, but on the other hand, if the film is factual which it certainly says it is, perhaps the church does want to remain silent on this issue especially because as I stated above it covers over the decades and is still a continuing problem. When, I make these remarks I must add that I am not an atheist, or have a personal vendetta against the Catholic church, or Catholics in general. While, I do not go to a Catholic church, I do and have watched a Catholic television series for years now and have really enjoyed the sound teaching of the program and in many ways it has been a blessing to me. Also, I do not think that the intent of the filmmakers here was to stir up trouble, or slam religion, or religious institutions in general. I think the main purpose of this film was to show everything that was being covered up for all these years and is still covered up to this day and the fact that these people claim to be worshipping God and obeying His word, but in fact living deceitful lives that go against the true teachings of the Bible and everything that their faith stands for. The film is not condemning religion at all, but instead the people who use religion as a means to pervert their own lies and injustices and claim that it is all okay because they hide under the cloak of the church and so for them it must be okay when really it is not. This is a fascinating film to watch and just like any good news story, or world event that is unfolding before your eyes the film is in equal parts fascinating, entertaining and yet as I mention above that because it is dealing with sensitive issues and based on fact that it is also extremely affecting and will certainly leave an impression on you after you leave the theatre and perhaps for longer than that. Everything is done right with this film from it's excellent screenplay which incorporates real facts, events and people and glues us to the screen in a film that is more captivating and in a sense more thrilling than any other action films of this year, or perhaps many others. The entire cast here is all top notch as determined people who are bound and determined to get to the truth of this story. They are not just doing this as to make names for themselves, or to bring themselves a lot of money, but instead because the subject matter is also personal for them and the people that they interview and meet, so in a sense they are out to right an incredible wrong and will stop at nothing to uncover this. The characters each respond to the matter in their own ways which also leaves a very interesting and percept view of the whole subject and runs the gamut of how each individual would, or maybe would not feel in this type of case, or situation. The character development and the portrayals by the actors is excellent. This is one of the strongest casts I have seen in awhile. This is a film for people who stand for truth and love deeply moving and affecting films and this is certainly a film that will leave it's mark on the audience and perhaps society as well which is all because of the power and talent that went into making it. One of the year's best.",

The film is a strenuously faithful re-enactment of the story, directed and co-written by Tom McCarthy as the fifth time he sits in the director chair after a quite consistently outstanding resumÃ© (THE STATION AGENT 2003, THE VISTOR 2007, WIN WIN 2011), on the ground that we could all pretend that the horrendous Adam Sandler vehicle THE COBBLER (2014) had never happened.",
126,9 February 2017,barryrd,8, Spotlight on the Church,"I just watched this movie for the first time concerning a massive cover-up of pedophile priests by the Catholic Church in Boston. I liked the investigative team that went after the story, actors Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams. Ruffalo and McAdams showed the instincts and spunk of true reporters. Once they smelled a rat, they pursued the story relentlessly getting the facts needed to make public aware of the cover-up that kept pedophiles from answering for their crimes. Keaton was the boss who had to ensure the hard evidence was secured to give credibility to the story. Michael Keaton is compelling as the guy who grew up in Boston, attended Boston College and became one of the boys on the golf course hobnobbing with lawyers and journalists. But he knew things were not right in the way his hometown and its dominant religious body was dealing with a grave injustice that was wrecking the lives of many young people. We get the sense of life in Boston with its love of sports and homespun camaraderie, something of a foil to deflect crimes lurking on its own dark side. The new kid on the block, Liev Screiber, is the one who unleashes the hounds as he tries to break through the easygoing veneer of official Boston, particularly its clergy and its lawyers. He shows the uneasiness of a man who doesn't quite fit in but gives his team the support they need to get the story out. A fine movie with great acting from the above as well as Stanley Tucci, John Slattery and Jamie Sheridan. This is a movie that reminds people that institutions have to account for injustice and cover-ups aimed at protecting their sacred turf.",

In many movies like this the film can't resist making its main characters heros and the people they are going against the epitome of evil. One movie that comes to mind that did this was 'Concussion'. It set up Doctor Omalu as a hero and the NFL as the most evil corporation on the face of the planet. Fortunately, 'Spotlight' is not one of these films. It's one that understands how far subtly can go. And how far honesty can and should go. This is what makes 'Spotlight' stand apart from virtually every film in this genre. It displays some serious restraint on the part of writer/director Tom McCarthy. He seems to have such intimate knowledge about both this case and how we, as humans, react to things of this nature. ",

If it had to be a film then I think casting lesser/unknown actors would deliver more of an impact and remove the preconceived notions and biases of the bigger names involved here. Ron Slattery is an old hat at playing the upper management type and is no different here..Michael Keaton plays another manager who gets to sit in an office (did they really need him to do this?). Rachel McAdams gets another shot at being a serious reporter (State of Play) while being stripped of the charm and freshness she brought in Wedding Crashers, Morning Glory. We are treated to Mark Ruffalo running to the office (deep, riveting stuff). Then we get to watch him in the waiting room of a law office until he takes initiative to talk to the lawyer (another reference to ATPM).

The film follows the Spotlight team of the Boston Globe as they forage and delve down all possible avenues to uncover the story hidden for so many years. We share the horror and the disbelief as the scale of the cover ups come to light and get an insight as to how a good journalistic team can work together to find the correct facts and the best time and way to present them to the public.

I have chosen for my final write, rather than providing a long-winded, detailed plot summary, I reflect on the basis of the film and the message it is conveying along with inferences and techniques making the film so worth watching. Once again Mark Ruffalo reminds us his versatility and quality of acting - starring as the protagonist in the fast-paced, tense 'Spotlight'. Almost as if the tension of the film is built up as time advances the atmosphere is tangible, explaining horrid truths kept as secrets for many years, only to be exploited by a wise group of journalists. Ultimately, the film centres around the abuse and sexual harassment caused by priests in not only Boston, but all around the globe. With statistics manifesting their investigation, Rachel McAdams and Ruffalo visit victims for questioning in a bid to have the priests arrested for their actions. The alleged assaults by priests in the area seem surprising that information is only slowly unfolding 15 years on, but it is the thought of a young, religious child saying no not to a priest, but to God and turning down their religious beliefs as a form of manipulation by the so-called 'fathers'. Hard work, commitment and dedication are presented on screen and the investigation proves to be influential, sparking confidence in others to speak out about mistreatment from priests, all around the globe. An inspiring true tale that changed lives for the better.

The writers and director of this film are the ""Spotlight"" of filmmaking, opening up a sensitive story that people acknowledged but probably couldn't imagine on screen, and they brought it to us in a way where I felt all the emotions of someone finding out the truth for the first time.

The makers of ""Spotlight"" were obviously seeking to avoid cheap sensationalism. There is no use of flashback, and the interviews with the now-adult victims are brief yet detailed enough to make their point. There is little showing of the pedophiliac priests, and the public outcry that followed the first exposures of the scandal in Boston and throughout the world is effectively limited to the after-notes. Yet, it as if you are the proverbial fly on the wall of the ""Boston Globe"" and flying along with their reporters on the street.

With international tensions mounting over possible nuclear arms in North Korea we are seeing Cold War era films such as Bridge of Spies and Pawn Sacrifice. Or Trumbo, which deals with both of those themes! What, then, is it about large-scale bureaucratic cover up that is drawing our attention? I'm not sure, but Truth is currently playing which tells the story of the military hiding discrepancies in President George W.

Even Steve Jobs is about one man taking credit for the work of an entire team, in effect covering up their contribution by means of bureaucratic red tape.

This isn't a topic that people really like to discuss openly and is something that happened fairly recently and is still having an impact on society today. And this film did an amazing job at presenting this story in a way that makes it easy to understand for the audience and keeps it very grounded and real without making it a very uncomfortable thing to watch. It is impossible to tell the story without having to go into some of the horrifying and somewhat confronting details, so the film did great at finding a balance between being too controversial and being too Hollywood.

Yes I am a Christian so of course I'm not trying to make church look bad because the wickedness this film is trying to make everyone aware of has absolutely nothing to do with church. ""Spotlight"" is a well-crafted film that showed how the Boston Globe uncovered a huge scandal of child molestation in the local Archdiocese and how the Catholic Church tried to cover it up. I can see why this film won an Academy Award for best writing and original screen play, also the performances brought on by Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and Michael Keaton were fantastic. Being that this film is a true story it was disturbing how the Catholic Church went about covering up the scandal. While watching this film I was in awe. To me it was almost like the local Archdiocese was worse than the Mafia. It was amazing how much power and influence they had on the community.

Again I have respect for this film not bringing false parts to sell tickets but try to stick very close to the source materials. Kind of like what honest journalist would do, instead of faking a story to get the news across while exaggerating the whole ordeal. This is the opposite of a exaggerated film, most of the actors doesn't try to outshine others or try their best to act out more than others. They try to convey the characters in a very genuine manner. The plot is about a group of journalist going after the truth of what went down with the Catholic priests in secrecy. And it goes in a realistic direction throughout the whole process. There isn't any life threatening moments or secret societies or any of that stuff. It's a very genuine movie, showing what appears to be real people going after truth and justice. The acting is really good with characters that appear to be real.

And it was reporters from the Boston Globe who, undeterred by threats, both implied and overt, conducted a year-long investigation into the pattern of pedophilia and the subsequent cover-up of it by religious and government figures in their city and made it public, causing a worldwide firestorm that in many ways damaged the Catholic church irreparably.

The scale of it might be small, if you take into account that Boston is just one city, but the size of what was going is impressive. So many people, boys and girls, our cousins, brothers, or aunts were molested as kids and paid off for their trouble. Left to live with a burden and a secret that could eat them alive.

This movie shows how corrupt even the most ""sacred intuition"" can be and how blinded people can be for their own benefit, or defending what they believe to be correct, putting aside the harm they are making.

It's a very powerful story as it documents the tale of how a newspaper organisation uncovered the Cathaolic priests actions of child molestation, it was not afraid to tell this story, one that I feel anyone over the age of 16 should be aware of. It's truly shocking to watch, of course we are all aware of these scandals, but it was only when I saw the victims talk about their unpleasant experiences that I finally began to see the realness of the situation, it makes you question your own faith, in both society and religion, have to love movies that do that to you. However, I felt the film did not entirely rise to the heights of its true story, there were times where it felt like they were holding back, as if the real thing was too much for audience goers, this easily could have been a ten for me if they had struck that level of power all the way through and did not hold back for the sake of being too surreal. The performances are phenomenal and will be well appreciated for years to come, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams deliver some of their very best work, they are also joined by talented actors such as Liev Schreiber, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci who all manage to convey the passion of these people for their work. The highlight has to be Mark Ruffalo, an actor who only seems to improve every time I see him, he is completely engrossed in to the role of Mike Rezendes, he understood the characters struggles and felt them, ending up with a heart wrenching, very effective performance. A true story that everyone should know about and a well deserved Best Picture win, I would recommend Spotlight to all moviegoers. ",

Spotlight is a very minimalistic film; dialogue driven, subtly directed and almost documentary style. Most of the film is just people talking, but it's a ruthlessly absorbing film more thrilling than many thrillers and more horrifying than most horror films. Although it's very low key, it's a strong, hard-hitting and deeply powerful tale, brought to life with excellent acting and Tom McCarthy's superbly stripped down direction. Spotlight is not just a movie. It's life. It's a real event, populated with human characters which doesn't resort to manipulation, pyrotechnics, emotional breakdowns or a load of shouting. A very worthy, engrossing and fittingly affecting drama, this actually lives up to the Oscar hype for once. It's probably too low key to win Best Picture, but I'd have no complaints if it did.",

The journalism side of the film is really well done. You really get to understand how they build such a big story and uncover it in great detail. All the actors who play the journalists working for the globe are great. Michael Keaton leads the team and he does a great job of getting to the truth of the story.

The music and pacing was fine but at times felt like a really high end TV movie rather than a theatrical film. It is an affecting drama, well-told, I just felt it never reached the fever pitch of outrage it really should have, and the ending is quite underwhelming.

I personally don't think anything about the film is awards worthy, except maybe Ruffalo (what else is new?) and while Todd McCarthy is a fine filmmaker, this is not his best film and nowhere near the directorial achievement of someone like Lenny Abrahamson for Room.

Based on the true story, Spotlight is a small group of journalists writing investigative articles, for The Boston Globe, that take months to research and publish, in existence since the 1970s, and they have a rule, they are not to discuss their work with anyone else - family, friends or other staff at the newspaper. In 2001, The Boston Globe has hired new editor Marty Baron (Scream's Liev Schreiber), he meets with Spotlight editor Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Michael Keaton), Baron has read an article about lawyer Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) who says that Cardinal Law (Len Cariou) (the Archbishop of Boston) knew that priest John Geoghan was sexually abusing children but did nothing to stop it. Baron urges the Spotlight team to investigate, Garabedian initially declines an interview after being contacted by journalist Michael ""Mike"" Rezendes (Oscar BAFTA nominated Mark Ruffalo), but Garabedian is persuaded to talk when Rezendes reveals he is on the Spotlight team, despite being told not to. The Spotlight journalists, including Sacha Pfeiffer (Oscar nominated Rachel McAdams), interview victims who bravely come forward, the team initially believe they have been following the molestation crimes of one priest who has been moved around several times, but the team slowly uncover a pattern of sexual abuse of children by Roman Catholic priests in Massachusetts, and an ongoing cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese. A man who heads a victim's rights organisation comes forward claiming to know thirteen priests have committed abuse crimes, the search is widened, they also look through annual directories showing all priests in Boston, the recordings show many names as leaving on ""sick leave"" and ""emergency response"", it is an official designation by the church when someone is moved after being caught molesting children. An ex-priest, who worked trying to rehabilitate paedophile priests, also gives them information that reveals that there should be approximately ninety abusive priests in Boston alone, through the research they have uncovered of priests leaving parishes for specific reasons they develop a list of eighty-seven names, and they find their victims to back up their suspicions. The September 11 attacks force the team to deprioritise the story, but weeks later they regain momentum when Garabedian reveals to Rezendes that documents, confirming Cardinal Law was aware of the priest child abuse problem and ignored it, are available to the public, he is eventually able to access them. The Boston Globe wins a legal case to have even more legal documents unsealed, and the Spotlight team finally start writing the story that will expose this massive conspiracy, publication is planned for early 2002. Robby confesses to the team, as they are about to go to print, that he was sent a list of twenty paedophile priests in 1993 in a story he never followed up on, Baron nevertheless tells him and the rest of Spotlight that they are doing important work. The story goes to print in The Boston Globe, with a link leading to the documents that expose Cardinal Law and a phone number requesting victims of paedophile priests to come forward, the following day the Spotlight team is flooded with phone calls from victims wanting to tell their stories, of course this conspiracy has also been exposed in other parts of the world. Also starring The Adjustment Bureau's John Slattery as Ben Bradlee Jr., Brian d'Arcy James as Matt Carroll, Big Fish's Billy Crudup as Eric Macleish, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation's Paul Guilfoyle as Pete Conley, Law & Order: Criminal Intent's Jamey Sheridan as Jim Sullivan and The Cabin in the Woods' Richard Jenkins as Richard Sipe. The performances of Keaton, Ruffalo (who deserved his nominations), McAdams, Shreiber and Tucci are all fantastic, in Britain we were rocked by the paedophile revelations of sexual offenders and ""predators"" like Lost Prophets singer Ian Wakins, TV presenter Rolf Harris and especially the monster that is TV presenter, DJ and charity worker Jimmy Savile, so a film like this was always going to come around. This film is directed and written brilliantly, it works well to show us the power of modern journalism and investigation, it is shocking of how a story of one offending priest turned into dozens and the seriousness of hiding these facts from the public, it is utterly engrossing from start to finish, a must see biographical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

They are searching for the next story they are going to report. Enter new editor, Marty Baron(Liev Schreiber). He tells team Spotlight, to thoroughly research the major scandal of child molestation within the Boston Catholic Archdiocese. Baron also asks them to find out how the Catholic Church covered this up & why no major newspaper publication got a wind of this thoroughly disturbing story. What the Spotlight team discovers, is extremely shocking. The truth that comes out, rocks the Catholic Church & the whole city of Boston to its very core. ",

Church friends tell me they feel bad about the ""incident"", but will continue to cling to the church and its important dogma and leave God to punish any priests who might have been guilty.

But the film is a bit anaemic. The cinematography is seemingly deliberately drab and doesn't show much imagination. The film shows how important it is that journalists are given the time to make contacts, build trust and gather evidence. Also, I guess, how their work can be banal and far from glamorous and requires persistence in the face of rejection. The film is almost slavish in not depicting the journalists as heroes -- in fact several times they are asked by victims and contacts why they overlooked obvious evidence of rampant pedophilia many times in the past. The acting is good -- the film is well cast, with Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and Stanley Tucci all possessing plenty of restrained intelligence. As editor Marty Baron, Liev Schreiber is so laidback he's almost comatose, but it does show that not all editors are fiery extroverts. It would have been improper, given the subject matter, if the film had have been too lively and dramatic, but drama needs tension, and in the script, too often dilemmas resolve themselves quickly and neatly. It's not an outstanding film, but quite a good one, and its themes, such as the need to have courage to expose painful truths, are worth portraying.",

It's not really on to single out one or even several performances when what we have here is an ensemble performance of the highest standard but the low-key non-sensational aspect is a definite plus and in terms of how newspapers used to be run it's right up there with Richard Brroks' Deadline USA.

I am sick and tired of movies that use the infinitely compelling and tragic topic of child molestation to gather interest, and then the movie does not deliver the goods. One or two lines about a priest telling a little boy to do something sick does not a great movie make. If this had been a Clint Eastwood movie, I guarantee he would have taken us behind closed doors, perhaps even a look at one of the sick, twisted mothers of one of these kids that knew her child was being molested by these nasty priests and did nothing about it for whatever reason. And dear God, where are the NUNS??? Nuns are just as sick and twisted as priests if not more. And maybe, its time for somebody to film the echo of one of these scenes taking place; show us the priest going into the boy's confessional or something.

Of course, the priests wouldn't have preyed on a kid like me because my father would have beat them to death with a bible had he found out. This film describes how priests chose children from broken families and on boys who showed signs of homosexuality.

We are now hearing about nuns being abused by priests. As a lifelong Catholic, I was fortunate that I wasn't a victim of such abuse. This film isn't about the abuse although horrible and massive to have thousands of survivors come forward but it is about the institution of the Catholic Church who abused their power in failing to protect vulnerable, innocent children from such horrific abuse. I know that the Catholic Church is not infallible. They are at fault for allowing such heinous but crimes but they are not alone. There are other religious organizations who have survivors coming forward about their own abuse. I hope that they don't stop coming forward. Boston was a heavily Catholic city with a strong Catholic influence in its politics and history. Boston was the hometown of the Kennedys and other Irish Catholics.

This movie is brilliant all across the board: the performances, the cinematography, the story, the dialogue, the direction, and just about everything in-between. If you're Catholic, please understand this movie is NOT an attack on Catholocism, but mainly a film exploiting a systemic issue in the Catholic Church. If anything, Catholics should be more outraged than the rest of us, but I digress. Spotlight is a beautifully realized film with a very obvious amount of blood, sweat and tears put into it.

He was perfectly cast for this film, since he was a native Bostoner. The issue of the Catholic Church consistently and constantly covering up child abuse by priests has been with us since the first Catholic school was established in the US. I went to a Catholic elementary school, and our priests were as clean as a whistle. But a lot of other schools and priests were not. That is why this film is so important.

292,21 January 2016,dragline82,7, Not enough horsepower,"Loaded with great performances. I didn't know Liev Schreiber could be lovable. Or Stanley Tucci likable, let alone great. The main problem here is you have a story with heavy subject matter, and a realistic portrayal about how a group of journals might go about solving the problem. But the realism doesn't allow for a dramatic engaging look into the issue that gets to its core, that is hard hitting enough for the subject's weight. Basically it needed someone in the movie to go, ""It's about child rape. What's the moral grey area of that assh-les?"" Instead Mark Ruffalo goes ham but not really. ""If it takes a village to raise the child, it takes a village to abuse one."" It needed more of that.",

They did a great job making it feel like the early 2000's. The only thing is, that this Movie is completely unremarkable. It's not a bad movie, nothing in it is bad.

It absolutely deserves its Best Picture win.",
297,30 January 2016,sol-,8, Shine a Light,"Based on the true story of how reporters at the Boston Globe shone a light on a culture of covering up child abuse in the Catholic Church, 'Spotlight' tells an interesting slice of modern history. It is remarkably riveting given that the outcome is well known as the film places us in the shoes of the reporters, unaware of just how a big a story they have. The film shows the emotional toll that the investigation has on the reporters; one wrestles with whether to tell his neighbours after discovering a possible predator priest living in his neighbourhood. Mark Ruffalo has the flashiest performance as the angriest reporter on the team, and the film gets some good thrills out of his struggles against bureaucracy to obtain incriminating public documents, yet Michael Keaton delivers the film's finest performance. As a born and bred Boston citizen, he finds himself internally divided and has some excellent moments near the end as he reveals a shocking twist about himself. The choice to focus on the reporters to almost the exclusion of the victims renders the film an odd experience though; the reporters seem more disgusted by the corruption of the Church than the actions of their priests and the psychological impact of child abuse. Never to mind, the characters are interesting enough that the film works as a tale of the power of a few motivated individuals to take on an institution and make a difference. Director Tom McCarthy uses gradual zooms in and out in all the office scenes to smartly prevent the film from feeling static and Howard Shore places the icing on the cake with yet another powerful score.",

My personal favourite of the nominees, The Big Short, lost out, and the stand-out film of the year, Inside Out, wasn't even on the list (although it took home the Best Animated Feature), but the lack of truly great films this year doesn't take anything away from Spotlight, which is a riveting little procedural hampered by a surprising emotional distance from the disturbing subject matter.",
300,6 January 2019,diegojosmer,8, Deserving of All the Awards,"Spotlight is such an important and powerful film. This is the story of a team of Boston Globe journalists who discovered how the church was hiding many pedophile priests giving them no real punishments. This film won Best Picture about three years ago and it totally deserved it. What makes this movie so great is that it decided to showcase the complete journalism process, the way we start to see our four reporters start to uncover the truth is amazing. It's not about the drama or the personal struggles of a particular character, it's about how a journalist does his or her job, and why it's important. Apart from that, it doesn't shy away from the subject matter of pedophiles. On one particular scene Sacha, the character amazingly played by Rachel McAdams, says: ""Language is going to be really important here. The word 'molest' isn't going to be enough"". And that's totally it, we get the hard and difficult truth of the actual events that happened with no sugarcoating.
The overall look and tone of the film was beautiful, there are a couple shots that took my breath away. And this top level of filmmaking complements the top level acting from the whole ensemble.
This movie is so real it actually terrifies me about the situation they uncovered. It's the truth, which can be really hard and disturbing, but it's the whole truth.",

303,29 May 2016,leonblackwood,6, Touching and very emotional! 6/10,"Review: Although I found the subject matter touching and pretty upsetting at times, and all of the actors put in a great performance, from an entertainment point of view, it seemed more like a documentary than a cinematic extravaganza, and I really wanted to see the priest's get punished for all of there nasty acts. I'm glad that the director used top actors to portray such a touching story, about a group of journalist, who work for the Boston Globe, and go to extreme lengths to undercover the terrible true story about priest who rape young kids. The fact that the important documents were hidden away, was truly disgusting, and the poor victims, who were mostly damaged for life, also touched me. You do have to be in the right mood to watch this film because it is very one toned and it is one of those movies that will leave you feeling angry and pretty emotional. As for the performances, all of the actors gave this delicate subject, there all, and it shows journalist in a different light, by proving that they also can do good without uncovering a scoop, just for profit. Personally, I don't think that it's one of those films that you can watch time and time again but it's still a well made movie, which brings an untold story to light. Enjoyable!",
304,7 December 2015,Icedooitle,8, Past the Punchline,"When Stanley Kubrick was asked what he thought of the Holocaust epic ""Schindler's List"", he responded ""Schindler's List is not the story of 6 million Jews who died; it's the story of 600 Jews who didn't."" You can't tell the story of millions or even thousands of victims in a single picture. Schindler's List took a sample that acted as a small consolation for the largest atrocity of the last century. Likewise, the largest religious scandal of the last century can't be told in a single story. Spotlight takes a similar approach to subject matter of this scale and limits the scope to a single but crucial city, Boston. ",

Gets to the inner workings of doing real journalism in a way that is super rare these days, save for pro publica, the intercept and the sometimes good NY Times reporting (which is completely countered by their horrible foreign reporting, particularly on the middle east). To continue, the director takes the viewer through a very thorough procedural approach towards what happened, who was involved, the manner in which the reporting needed to be carried out and it was involving although there was no real ""action"" on screen, the implications were enormous and very well conveyed. The editing, in particular, stood out. The ensemble acting was great although Marc Ruffalo, who I love!, was a little too much into character, a bit too much of the moak, Live Schriber and Keaton were great, they really kept it battened down.

307,19 March 2016,eharbour-17624,5, Doubt was better.,"I'm not sure why anyone sets out to make a dramatised version of such a story, if you don't have a victim or a priest or a reporter at the heart of it. I agree that the story-telling is clear and unfolds in a way that adds to your knowledge of the history of events, but that could be achieved in a documentary too. I don't agree that the acting was great, it felt mediocre to me, but with its ensemble cast you have weak characters, no character development and so very little for the actors to get their teeth into. It felt to me like any drama or tension was crow-barred in for the purposes of giving the audience some excitement, when for example Mark Ruffalo's character is running to the records office and banging on the door as it closes. Such moments seemed forced and straight out of the clichÃ© book. Commendable to make a film on this subject and bring people's attention to the crimes that were allowed to continue to take place,but a worthy subject does not make a great film. For me the direction was really dull and this looked like it could have been made for TV. A much better film on the subject is 'Doubt' without doubt.",

Indeed he is reading up the Red Sox, which is perhaps the second religious organisation in Boston.

312,7 March 2016,drqshadow-reviews,9, Dedicated Testament to a Tireless Investigation,"A really great, slow-burn investigative piece that pays fealty to classics of the genre like All the President's Men. It's been a while since I've seen a picture with this much grit, restraint and respect for the story, and that makes the last half-hour feel transcendent, even if it's also strikingly bittersweet. Michael Keaton is excellent in another Best Picture winner, his second in as many years, and Mark Ruffalo shows tremendous passion and fire in a major ensemble effort. There's nothing flashy or indulgent about Spotlight, a rarity nowadays, and that vacancy leaves room for us to observe and appreciate the difficult, compounded, thankless efforts of these masters of their profession. It's also, often, a stark reminder that 2001 (where the movie is set) wasn't just yesterday. The world has changed fundamentally over the past fifteen years, and it's staggering how often this comes across, effectively, as a period piece. Essential viewing for a wide variety of reasons.",

317,10 August 2020,aidanratesmovies,10, A Masterpiece,"With outstanding direction from McCarthy, and some brilliant performances from all the incredibly talented actors involved, Spotlight doesn't just prove to be the best movie of the year, but one of the better films ever made. Its story is quite shocking, and it deals with the material quite respectfully, but what is most impressive is that it never feels like the information is being shoved down our throats. McCarthy and Singer, who wrote the script for the film, write very delicately with the information provided, and do it in a way that can be incredibly accurate and shocking without ever seeming like a burden to follow. The cast in the film is fantastic. All actors provide a great job, but I must say that Michael Keaton was truly snubbed by the awards ceremonies for his performance as Walter Robinson (aka Robbie). His performance isn't just accurate, but truly emotional, and Keaton brings his absolute best to his role, continuing his fantastic acting streak since the previous best picture winner- Birdman. Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo also provide terrific performances in their roles respectively, and I find it seriously dumbfounding how none of these actors were nominated for the credit they so deserve. The film isn't just entertaining, but with a film so bound on just human beings and their experiences, it is truly amazing how the film can be so thrilling and suspenseful to watch. This isn't an ordinary 'based on a true story' scenario, although their are a couple of moments that may seem like it is so. This is far beyond that precedent, and this film sets a new precedent in return, marking not only a creative and brilliant filmmaking achievement, but a truly outstanding work of art that will be viewed for many years to come. On top of the brilliant direction, writing, and acting, the cinematography also shines in this film with its grounded but naturally beautiful approach, and I couldn't help but awe at the detail and thought put into every frame. In the end, Spotlight isn't just a great film, its a masterpiece, and I encourage anyone who hasn't seen it, regardless of their beliefs or views, to give it a try. You won't regret it.

318,13 April 2018,sakram,4, So what ?,"I don't get it, all these positive reviews, I read the short description of the movie, I really liked the idea, it's a very sensitive subject that had to be discussed sooner or later, but 60 minutes into the movie and I dropped it, like seriously ? It's so boring, all these names thrown here and there, it's dialogue-heavy for no obvious reason, there is no important dialogue going on, just a bunch of workers, handling a case, interviewing a bunch of victims, and voilÃ , nothing more. I felt underwhelmed, bored to death. If it were not for the subject-matter, or the actors, this movie would get a zero. So for subject matter and actors' performances : 4/10",

Whereas The Two Popes is almost exclusively just the two stellar actors going back and forth, Spotlight is all about the ensemble. This has such a great cast, each of them delivering solid performances and really driving the plot in their own ways. It's so well balanced in fact that I struggle to think who I would consider the ""Lead"" to be. Ruffalo jumps to mind but Keaton is absolutely captivating, McAdams is always great...

Nowadays we have plenty examples to support that, and when a well intention guy or group try to dive into this deep waters, things usually become disagreeable.",
321,21 May 2016,NateWatchesCoolMovies,8, Devastating,"Spotlight focuses on a devastating turn of events which were ripe for melodrama, and instead turns out to be a spare, minimalistic entry that knows how to keep things close to the chest and still be deeply affecting. Director Tom McCarthy takes a fly-on-the-wall approach to his technique, showing us an intimate glimpse at what it no doubt must have been like for these Boston reporters as they brought to light one of the most sickening and heinous atrocities of our time, the sexual abuse scandal of the Catholic Church, which rotted through many a priest, parish and law firm who insidiously kept their mouths shut about the whole deal. For the reporters, ignorance was just not on the table, no matter what the consequences. Rachel McAdams is tender and fearless as Sacha Pfeiffer, a keen operative who is first to smoke out a lead, bringing it to her boss, the legendary Walter 'Robby' Robinson, (Michael Keaton), and the executive in charge of the paper, Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery). The matter is brought to further attention by Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), who arrives from out of state. It's Mike Rezendes though, played by a stunning Mark Ruffalo, who drives the point home, refusing to give up and shoving loads of empathy down the throats of those who would look the other way. Ruffalo is note perfect, his determined sentiment delivered with compassion and impact that lingers. He hounds diamond in the rough lawyer Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci hides the sympathy behind the sass) to allow him access to the victims, giving him something concrete to go on. The bitter side of the lawyer coin comes in the form of Eric McLeish (underrated Billy Crudup), a passively belligerent guy who is anything but cooperative until the hammer comes down. Richard Jenkins proves that he can turn in excellent work with nothing but his voice, playing a source who is heard only via phone calls. Keaton is brilliant, bringing the laid back nature and giving the character an easy listening style Boston accent. McAdams mirrors the hurt in those she interviews with eyes that echo years of suffering. Tucci comes the closest the film gets to comic relief, and then veers into dead serious mode as he realizes his character is in control of lives with the info he has, snapping to rigid attention. Watch for work from Jamey Sheridan, Len Cariou, Brian D'Arcy James and Paul Guilfoyle as well. The film arrives at its destination free from obvious emotional fireworks, on screen text or sensationalism, elements which often permeate true life stories. It's simple, to the point, grounded and diligent to story, character and truth. That approach makes it all the more shattering.",
322,13 March 2017,davispittman,10, Well deserved best picture award winner,"Spotlight is one of the best films I have ever seen. The story/plot, which is based off of true events is a deeply disturbing one. This movie centers around Spotlight, which is an investigative journalist group of reporters at The Boston Globe, and how they investigate the Catholic Church turning a blind eye and ultimately covering up many many priests physically molesting children. The movie does a wonderful job telling this very eye opening shocking story. The actors are a big factor in how powerful and effective the movie is. Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schriver, and Stanley Tucci all turn in great performances. It's my personal opinion that Ruffalo shines the brightest hear and his Oscar nomination is well deserved. Also what makes the film so moving and well made is the writing. The script for the film is very well put together/thought out and it does a great job at doing the true story justice, it takes you to a place of deep emotion. It's just the right runtime too, it's not an overly long film, it's just at two hours, any shorter and it wouldn't be doing the whole story justice, and too much longer would have been stretching it. I thought hearing the victims explain their stories in sometimes graphic detail was absolutely necessary, as McAdams says in one scene: ""the language is going to be very important"". Also the film clearly states and makes it clear that this has nothing to do with being gay, I loved that the filmmakers stated that because molestation can and is often used by overly conservative people as for a reason why people are gay. The very serious and heartbreaking issue that the film tackles is a story that everyone needs to hear and be educated about. This isn't fluff entertainment but it's a powerful important well made film. 10/10.",

The film is fascinating, low key but suspenseful even though you know the story...and the fact that, almost two decades after the Boston Globe published its series on the cover-up by the highest levels of the Boston Catholic diocese of decades of sexual abuse of children by nearly 100 priests, it is still reverberating worldwide today. The script, direction and acting are excellent. Can't wait to see a film soon about how dogged, moral, heroic journalists bring down the current corrupt presiden and his enablers.",

330,14 July 2018,KidWithOpinions,10, One of the best movies EVER,"Spotlight is probably the best Best Picture. This movie is the only movie so far that has gotten an A+. It gets it because of its beautiful acting and its beautifully told story.
 What surprised me the most was the fact that it only won two Oscars. I mean sure it won Best Picture, but all the acting awards it was nominated for they did not win. The 88th Academy Awards had Leonardo DiCaprio for Best Actor, Mark Rylance for Best Supporting Actor, Brie Larson for Best Actress, and Alicia Vikander for Best Supporting Actress. So I can see why it did not win any of the Acting Oscars. Even though it had some amazing performances I guess that does not mean it wins them. Spotlight got snubbed at the Golden Globes, which I do not agree with, the gave the Award for Best Motion Picture-Drama to The Revenant. This does not help the fact that I already hate the Golden Globes. This makes me hate them even more, so good job.
 Mark Ruffalo delivers the audience a phenomenal acting job. He did get an Oscar nomination but he did not win it. Rachel McAdams got the other nomination but did not win it ( sadly) but again there was no way that Spotlight could win any of the acting awards. Spotlight is super depressing but it is so well made that you feel an emotional bond to these characters, so good job on the writing, and hay, they won the Oscar for Best Writing-Original Screenplay. This movie makes you suddenly get more cautious of the fact that, you might live next to or go to church with child molesters.
 Spotlight is rated R for some language including sexual references ( official MPAA rating). You could show your kids this when they are about thirteen maybe fourteen. This movie is on the list of movies you have to watch sometime in your life. You will probably watch it if you go to film school.
 Spotlight is the best 21st Century Best Picture. I give Spotlight an A+, for its beautiful acting and its beautifully told story.",

A film that is not histrionic in its presentation, but slowly and methodically builds a case which unearths the horrific breach of trust between ""believers"" and those who are anointed as their spiritual sentinels in the secular world. The aftermath of the newspaper's disclosures reverberated beyond its local sphere of examination into an international autopsy exhuming shame and dishonor upon the Church and its leaders.",

What begins to look like just only a handful of cases becomes to reveal itself a practice of systematic abuse of lots of children in several places in the country during many years with the covering of high placed members of the hierarchy. The team comes upon several obstacles, from the more or less disguised opposition of the Church members to occultation attempts by lawyers who took part in private and half secret settlements between some victims and the hierarchy, passing through occultation of important documentary evidence (not only by lawyers) and the resistance of some victims to talk about their cases.

I liked the movie, I was drawn into its steady pace and awesome performances of all the actors, and my personal Like goes on to a beautifully elegant Rachel McAdams who is excellent here and she is deeply real as a journalist. And, yeah, all other main stars are tremendous here - Michael Keaton, Liev Schreiber, Mark Ruffalo, Stanley Tucci - they all did a vastly satisfying work and one never doubts these are paper men, journalists who dig and who find the Truth. And the topic is extremely important and is depicted very well. The whole theme of child molesting by certain Roman Catholic priests is a deeply painful yet important one to reveal.

Plus it's a nice break from the summer blockbusters and occasional indie film my local stores decide to keep on hand. Now that I've seen SPOTLIGHT, I can vouch that it's a fantastically interesting movie. I don't know that I would've gone so far as to award it Best Picture at the biggest of movie award shows, especially over some of the other options, but it's certainly good. It's the story of the Spotlight team, a small crew of investigative journalists at the Boston Globe, and how they ran the article exposing years of child sexual abuse at the hands of Catholic priests and, more importantly, how the Church was aware and actively covered it up in a massive conspiracy. Based on the true story, it begins with a new editor assuming command of the Globe in 2001 and requesting that the Spotlight team run a follow-up on the case of a local Boston priest who'd been busted as a pedophile.

The hot-potato-topic is an important addition to the already global critical discourse regarding pedophilia in the Catholic Church and a condemnation of its practice of merely removing child molesting priests to other parishes. The portraits of victims, already formed adults with families or single, gay or straight, but with the common characteristic of suffering badly under the suppressed trauma of the abuse, are both touching and revealing. It shows how deep you need to dig to find the source of suffering in a person, and how a fear of stigmatization can turn a person into a psychological mess, whereas the real culprits remain unpunished. In many communities, the Church plays a central role in terms of social life or can even be the only way out of peril for destitute people and children from troubled backgrounds. Which makes exposing the very people who help you as monsters in disguise even harder, bordering on unbearable.

I would have added a few less known actors to the cast to make it more natural. To me Liev Schreiber was the most credible, Stanley Tucci (with hair!) did also a great job.

390,5 January 2016,ryan-bfd,9, A beautifully crafted true story,"It doesn't seem right to review this film. It actually feels like some sort of moral infringement. This is because I feel like ""Spotlight"" is one of the most important non-documentary films ever made. This story had to be told and Nicole Rocklin and Blye Faust (the film's producers) couldn't have hired a better cast to tell it. Given that I was looking for film-editing that flowed together more smoothly and cinematography that was darker and more shadowy to represent the shadiness of the Catholic Church at the time. But I can easily overlook all of this films flaws because of how intense this story is. Not to mention how well all of the lead actors fit their parts. My favorite performance has to be Mark Ruffulo's. His character is so awkward and twitchy is a very subtle sense that is pretty hard to get down for any less of an actor. It didn't seem that any of the other actors had to really try to nail any impressions or anything like that. The worst thing that they could have done really is overact and that didn't happen. As a result of how most of these characters being pretty much just average, every day type people, there weren't really any performances that were really Oscar-worthy to me but again the story that this movie tells just overshadows so many flaws for me and just turns this film into an eye-opening masterpiece. I love this film's tone. It doesn't really try to glorify anyone. It doesn't try to make anyone look like a hero. It just tells the truth about what happened, which is everyone was just doing their jobs. As a result, the Catholic church was allowed to get away with a lot of sexual molestation of minors. But, ironically, it also prompted their downfall. If the journalists of the Spotlight team portrayed hadn't done their jobs correctly, who knows how long it would have taken for all of this to unfold. 'Spotlight' does not sugar- coat or over dramatize. It is a film encapsulated by realistic dialog and an attempt to tell this a true event exactly as it happen. It is in no way a film that has some sort of deep social commentary against organized religion. It doesn't try to encourage the audience to deviate from the Catholic fate or tell them what to believe. It is just a film about exposing the deepest and darkest side of supposedly one of the most holy and morally just institutions in the world.",

Yes, Spotlight indeed puts a 'figurative' spotlight on the scandal in the Catholic Church, which is a touchy subject, but the film felt a bit dull and actionless.

This film takes the audience on a journey of real life events uncovered by ordinary people. The director masters the craft of consuming its audience into the images on screen making this film one of a kind. Its ability to solely focus on the content and deny attention towards the cinematic extras solidifies its title as a masterpiece. Directed by Tom McCarthy and Open Road Films, Spotlight is an incredible motion picture about a team of journalists known as ""Spotlight"" stationed at the Boston Globe. These cutting edge journalists uncover the hidden secrets held under the Catholic Church system and its neglect upon punishing priests accused of molesting and abusing innocent young children. What started off as an isolated matter in the city of Boston with thirteen priests later evolves into a worldwide phenomenon. With any reporting job, one must decipher the basis of the story and progress from there. Beginning with very little information and slowly collecting information and tips along the way until a full blown story has been uncovered. This act is demanding and time-consuming as the film portrays through its incredible team including actors Mark Ruffalo as Michael Rezendes, Michael Keaton as Walter Robinson also known as Robby, Rachel McAdams as Sasha Pfeiffer , and Brian d'Arcy James as Matt Carroll. With other incredible actors including Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian, Live Schreiber as Marty Baron, and John Slattery as Ben Bradlee Jr. The team along with outside help embark on this dramatic journey to expose the identity and skeletons, which lie within the church and its priests, as well as the tear down of the system and destruction of law. With limited to no use of special effects, Spotlight utilizes the strength of its narrative and characters consuming audience members to become part of the story creating this unexpected performance. A coveting film leaving many decisive about the Church, honesty, and above all faith.",

Spotlight, released in 2015 and directed by Tom McCarthy, tells the real story of the Spotlight team at The Boston Globe who specialize in investigative journalism. The lead editor of the spotlight team, Walter Robbinson, played by Micheal Keaton is assigned to investigate child molestation allegations against John Geoghan, a priest located in Boston. When he and his team get on the case they find that 90 priests had sexually assaulted children and the church had covered it up. Determined to get this story out the spotlight team of Mark Rezendes, played by Mark Rufflao, Sacha Pfeiffer, played by Rachel McAdams, and Brian d'Arcy James, played by Matt Carroll, throw themselves into their work and find all the evidence they need to accuse the priests. What I really liked about this movie was the use of timelapse. Their work spanned over months of time and McCarthy used timelapse to show the work they have done in a short amount of time. I also really like the lighting options they chose for the film. How whenever we saw the normal office it had a darker greyish feel, but the spotlight office was bright, almost as if they were the light in the darkness.

The movie showcases stars such as Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfeiffer, Mark Ruffalo as Mike Rezendes, and Michael Keaton as Walter Robby Robinson. The first two roles depict dedicated reporters that were members of the Globe's Spotlight team, the movie's namesake, while the latter role is based on the man who was the specialized team's editor and leader. The quality of cinematography throughout the film is exemplary, consistently adding to not only the aesthetic, but the storyline as a whole. The movie demonstrates the perseverance through the monotony of in-depth research that its real life counterparts underwent, and the relentless search for the heart wrenching truth, intentionally hidden from the public by systemic deceit. The story told by the film is stomach churning, but the cinematographic decisions made throughout the film's entirety tell it in an accurate manner, as well as one that is respectful to the victims upon which it is based. The plot is not highly action-driven, but even its ""slow moments"" are intentional reflections of the painstaking effort put into the original work of the journalistic team. Spotlight is a must watch, that does justice to a story that must be shared, its subject matter accompanied by the film's high quality and the powerful filmmaking by which it was created.",

But that's the best thing about this film the fact that it stays with you, all the disturbing things you see or hear off in this film leaves an impression on its viewer that makes you realise the importance of the story these journalists are trying to tell. The Spotlight team themselves are very well realised, there not put on a pedestal as heroes but instead as people trying to tell a story and there subtle reactions to the horrors they are investigating fell real not just like it was done to add to the horrors. This film is an ensemble piece there's no one main character in this film but instead they all bounce of each other and work together well as a unit and there is not a bad performance in sight. Mark Ruffalo is proving to me more and more that he is becoming one of today's best actors, he has such a great character arc to him and when his scene where he explodes with anger feels very well earned. Rachel McAdams was also very good in this film, she had some truly hard to watch scenes where she interviews some of the victims and she keeps her vulnerability yet cool head at all times that make her a more believable character. Up until the year before with Birdman, Michael Keaton has never really impressed me outside of his Batman movies but here he was fantastic, very convincing as are the rest of the cast, through his performance we understand that's he more experienced in this field than most. Tom McCarthy directed this film beautifully, he has a very specific style about him where he keeps the camera in the same position for long periods of time and direction like this in my experience usually makes the film bland, but because of the brilliant performances and story I was never anything less than intrigued, the best shot in this film though was a long tracking shot that followed the reporters down the street to discover one of the people they are investigating lives nearby and it added a more personal touch to the main characters.

Slowly, not only the scale of the abuse, but the cruel indifference of church hierarchy and laity to children's suffering, historical collusion of Boston authorities, and the willful turning of a blind eye by the journalists themselves comes to the fore. This film is compelling and highly uncomfortable in equal measure. The investigation is carefully revealed without ever feeling heavy in exposition. Keaton is superb, and Ruffalo's pugnacious determination becomes the lightning rod for the rising fury of the audience. I came to this film wary of a dialogue-heavy, slightly preachy event.

Everybody does a fantastic job here, but Mark Ruffalo stood out to me the most from the bunch. He was amazing and was fully committed to the role from beginning to the end. Also the soundtrack by Howard Shore was Oscar worthy even though it wasn't even nominated on the category for some reason. Everything from the cinematography to the music and the editing builds up to an absolute masterpiece of a film that is created superbly for our eyes to enjoy and our minds to think.",

449,16 December 2015,yousidine,9, Transfer to Reality,"Spotlight is directed by Tom McCarthy, and this film stars Mark Ruffalo , Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, and pretty much many great actors. And this movie is about a scandal that involves the Catholic church, and there are these reporters played by Ruffalo, and the rest of the actors who are trying to write a story about the scandal, tracking people down. But there are obstacles in the way. When I first heard about this movie, I had a feeling that this movie has some potential. The trailer looks good, and all I knew is that there is this scandal, and there are these reporters trying to put it together and expose the truth. That was all I knew. So I knew this movie was going to be good. And it is. I'm very impressed. This is one of the best movies I have seen this year. And it's all done by its incredible acting, incredible script, and incredible directing. ",

I have to say that I really enjoyed every minute of the movie (as much as enjoy can be used as a verb in this type of cases). ",
451,25 April 2020,Hussain-AL-Naseer,8, Spot-on Spotlight,The film roughly roams around the investigative journalism about the child molestation and sexual abuse of children linked with the Catholic Churches. This type of bold topics are always tricky because depicting some religious scandals and controversies always generates criticism which sometimes goes beyond the expectations which might halt the release of the movie or may turn into total disaster. However despite of its bold theme in nature based on true events this film somehow got lucky as the film was not only got positive reception from Catholic community but also got praises from them acknowledging the accuracy of events and how originally the story and journalists helped them to identify this sinful act. The screenplay of the movie is one of the tightest and best I've come a crossed supported by crunch direction and some fine work by the seasoned actors including Michael Keaton.,

It is an important film and given the Royal Commission currently underway to address abuse cases originating from Australia, a topical one that really should be seen.",

456,27 November 2015,ReelBrew,7, A Boston Globe investigative team uncovers sexual abuse and misconduct in the Catholic Archdiocese that rocked Boston back in 2001.,"""What do you know?"" It's a simple question that is asked nonchalantly in the beginning of the film, but a question that holds heavy over us as we begin to question who knows what. In 2001, the Boston Globe began a piece on the countless uncovered molestation cases within the local Catholic Archdiocese. Using the papers Spotlight investigative team, the Globe would go on to expose and reveal the immense corruption that riddled the churches, rocking the foundation of the entire Catholic community. Heading the Spotlight team is Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), who with fellow journalists Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy Robinson) begin unfolding the layers of sexual abuse that have gone ignored and unheeded for almost thirty years. Director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent) creates a meditative film with dark roots that builds up a steady pulse, knowing when to pace itself as to keep from exhausting its subject matter. The offices of the Boston Globe lay thick with a soft, pastel hue that hearkens a commonality within the paper, prominently citing the latest Red Sox game with no real focus on journalistic content. It's a view that runs parallel to the Catholic Churches flippant behavior, tossing aside anything paramount that might disrupt the nature of things. Howard Shore (A History of Violence) works to emphasize the immediacy within each scene, as he creates what becomes background noise; it's a score that glides rather than soars, which is exactly what our focus needs. We witness what is only important to the story, to what's being investigated as we follow in front of our journalists; when they move the story we move. ",
457,1 April 2020,zlx_zjlq,9, A good movie about the news,"The authenticity of the event is shocking! Systematic torture, portrayal of journalists' work (more dramatic Newsroom), attention to the progress of the event itself rather than indulging in cheap lyricism, and modest depictions of several major reporters with different perspectives and different attitudes...All these have set an example as the highest standard of this type of social biographical drama. Keep asking about something bigger. I think it should be the ultimate responsibility of all art forms.",
