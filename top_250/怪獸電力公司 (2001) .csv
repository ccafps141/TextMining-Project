1,21 January 2004,Boba_Fett1138,10, Adorable movie with top class entertainment.,"The best way to describe this movie in one word is; fun! ""Monsters, Inc."" is a movie you can easily fall in love with. It has some great fun character, some awesome moments and some well placed comical moments. ""Monsters, Inc."" is entertainment at its bests.",r
2,10 July 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9, Nothing To Criticize Here - Very Solid Animated Film,"This is a very entertaining animated film. I've seen it twice and enjoyed even more the second time. Billy Crystal said he enjoyed making this film as much as any film he's ever done, so that's a good testimony that you'll get some laughs and enjoy this movie as an adult, too. ",e
3,2 January 2002,Spleen,10," The best computer animated film of them all, and the most adult","Until now I couldn't bring myself to believe that computer animation was the equal of either stop motion animation or hand-drawn animation.  All computer animated films looked a little (usually more than a little) too sterile, many were animated poorly (""Antz"", ""Shrek"", ""Final Fantasy""), and even the single unqualified success (""Toy Story 2"") provided little evidence that a computer animated film COULD reach the heights other kinds of animation could.  ""Toy Story 2"" had flawless character animation, but nothing as inspired as the best in ""Tarzan"" (released the same year, although I could have chosen almost any other Disney cartoon to make my point); effective art direction, but nothing to match ""Fantasia"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".  And I thought that ""Toy Story 2"" was as good as the art was ever going to get.",v

5,8 January 2019,jamesrupert2014,9, Monstrously clever and funny early Pixar CGI feature,"Sully and Mike (voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal) are employees at Monsters Inc., a scream-fueled plant that provides power to Monsteropolis. Screams are generated by 'scarers' (and Sully is the best), who enter children's bedrooms via the closet and are harvested by their partners (in Sully's case, his best friend Mike). Extreme care must be taken, as children are highly toxic to monsters, so when one is accidently transported to the factory, pandemonium ensues. The film is the fourth of Pixar's full length animated features and like most of the studio's work, is excellent. The story is fun with a clever 'twist' to the ending, the animators manage to inject a tremendous amount of character and personality into the CGI characters, and the choice of voice talent is perfect (I especially liked Steve Buscemi as the chameleonic villain Randall). CGI technology has advanced considerably since the film was released but the imagery still holds up and the vast 'closet door' storage facility is great. Typical of the studio, there are a lot of amusing details in the background that are worth watching for. Good, timeless fun for all ages.",e
6,29 December 2019,jackgdemoss,9, The animation even holds up at times.,"I was recently gifted a ""100 movie advent calendar"" for Christmas. When you are ready to watch a movie you scratch one of the boxes off and it tells you what to watch. The first draw was Monsters, Inc. I haven't seen this classic for over 10 years, but my wife was pulling quotes out verbatim. The opening 10 minutes are executed to perfection. The characters are introduced nicely, the plot and obstacle to overcome laid out, the world built, and the comedic timing perfect. The compilation of Mike training Sully with scare exercises had me rolling. The movie does lose steam after this first 10 minutes but it certainly never sputters out. Monsters, Inc. is a classic for a reason, and is a must see.",w
7,12 December 2001,ahill-1,10, Now here's a story children and adults can relate too. Monsters in the closet.,"While monsters in the closet may seem to be a scary reality for some children, `Monsters, Inc.' makes it light hearted by showing them it's all in a night's work.

But together we can make better future. The friendship to last long. Understanding each others power, strength and weakness. The core of our institution may be hollow and biased but are we strong enough to challenge the black sheeps in the institution? Fun with screams and laughter. Enjoy.",r
9,16 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9, Definitely one of the best films of 2001!,"This was a wonderful movie, with colourful characters, a fun storyline, and a funny and sometimes touching script.(I liked Shrek as well, but I slightly preferred this) I don't think it is quite as good as Toy Story, but I found it an enormously entertaining film, it was much better than I expected. The animation was truly excellent, with colourful and engaging backgrounds, and no stiff movements as far as I could see. I wasn't hugely keen on the song playing over the end credits, but compared to the overall goodness of the film, that is such a minor criticism, and it is fair to say that people have different tastes in music. The script was very, very funny, particularly with the character Roz. The voice talents were fantastic, John Goodman and Billy Crystal were brilliant as Sulley and Mike, Steve Buschemi clearly has a lot of seedy fun as Randall, Jennifer Tilly is wonderfully innocent as Mike's girlfriend, and the late James Coburn is wholly convincing as Waternoose. And I loved the character of Boo, she was so cute, and I loved the ending, people complained it was overly-sentimental but I thought it was so sweet. The story, as is always the case with Pixar films is highly original and charming, and doesn't drag at all. Overall, a wonderful film, truly entertaining and a must-see, and if you are starting to lose faith in Disney and their countless sequels, this is perfect for you. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox.",w

11,9 February 2002,Howlin Wolf,7," Light, enjoyable fare that proves animation is still on top...","... when it comes to producing well-rounded, realised and consistently entertaining movies.  Is it just me or have there been no REALLY awful animated films from the stables of the top studios like Pixar and Dreamworks, etc?  The movie industry as a whole should perhaps sit up and take notice of the craft that goes into these movies.  Both 'suits' and audiences are sure to benefit if that ever happens.  Long may the tradition of quality animated movies be, I say!",4

13,30 January 2006,Lady_Targaryen,9, We Scare Because We Care!,"''Monsters, Inc.'' is great! Before I have watched movies from Pixar like '' The Incredibles'',''Shrek'' or even ''Finding Nemo'', ''Monsters Inc.'' was one of the first movies made by Pixar that I watched and enjoyed a lot! The monsters like Mike and Sulley are charismatic and funny,and the story is very pleasant as well: ",7
14,6 July 2006,ManyGentleCuttlefish,10, My personal favorite Pixar movie,"Pixar. With only seven movies you've built yourself a reputation as the greatest current animation studio of them all. Dreamworks has made some good ones and 20th Century Fox's movies have made me chuckle a bit, and Disney has gone downhill in recent years. But you can consistently produce quality work with almost no stain on your track record (except A Bug's Life, the one Pixar movie I did not enjoy). But I've lost track of my thoughts.I'm here to talk about Monster's Inc., my personal favorite Pixar movie.",4
15,14 September 2005,Pigalina,10, Fantastic,"This film is great. It made me laugh out loud and made me feel sad when I was supposed to too. The monsters all live in a city called Monstropolis and they need the screams of children to power everything. Sully (the big blue furry monster) is the top scarer and he and his one-eyed green friend Mike work together at ""Monsters, Incorporated"" gathering screams. The monsters are terrified of the children however, thinking that if they get touched by a child they will die. One of the children (she ends up being known as Boo) gets into the monster world and everyone goes into a panic. Sully and Mike must return her to her home before she gets caught. Boo is a cute little character and that's a lot coming from me (I am not a huge fan of small children - it may be because she isn't real). There is also an evil creepy monster called Randal who is planning on kidnapping children to harvest as much scream as possible. The animation was great, I am always amazed at the patience that must go into animating hair, Sully is very hairy. As with all Pixar films there are ""bloopers"" during the credits which were really funny. With some of the rubbish that Disney seems to be coming out with (Little Mermaid 2, Jungle Book 2 anyone?), Disney/Pixar has to be the wave of the future.",2
16,17 July 2020,r96sk,9," Funny, wholesome, entertaining and touching","Always a pleasure to revisit this. 'Monsters, Inc.' is one of my favourite Disney animated films.",2
17,7 March 2002,action4jackson,10, Great movie!,Great family film. One of the most underrated movies of the year. I took my 2 year old to see it. He loved it! He now has books and toys of Mike and Sully! This movie will be going into our library. We can't wait for the DVD release in September 2002!,/
18,10 June 2007,planktonrules,9," Of all the Pixar movies, this is among the very best","Aside from TOY STORY II (which I loved), this might just be the best film Pixar has released. It's a really close race between it and THE INCREDIBLES for second best. And considering how wonderful their movies are, this isn't a bad place to finish. Unfortunately for the good folks at Disney, MONSTERS, INC. could not have come out at a worse time. Just days after its release, the even better and more timeless SHREK was released--thereby stealing MONSTERS, INC's thunder and resulting in its just being lost in the shuffle. It's a real shame, though, as this is a wonderful film from start to finish. The voices of the characters were great, computer animation tops and the story line, though silly, worked. But for me, the biggest surprise was that as a jaded adult and very critical person, I loved the cutesy addition to Baby Boo to the film. She was, without a doubt, the cutest thing I have ever seen but also was not gratuitously cute or nauseatingly cute. She was just a perfect addition to an otherwise great film. If you haven't seen this film, get off you behind and see it--it's great stuff and kids as well as adults will love this film.",?
19,16 January 2005,astutekitty,10, One of the most endearing animation films created,"Pixar is the best! Of them all, Monsters, Inc. takes the cake. The realism of the characters' movements & feelings is perfect. The ending is a tear jerker on a happy note. At first I was concerned with the plot of monsters scaring children with a ""business as usual"" attitude, but right away you discover that the monsters are as terrified of the kids as the kids are of monsters.... wonderful juxtaposition throughout the film... a totally enjoyable, feel-good story. Buy it for the kids and let them watch it over and over. (adults may want to sit-in on more than one occasion themselves). Personal Note: For me, a mystery about this film was ""Roz""; the voice reminded me so strongly of the grandmother in ""Dinosaurs"", and I thought the character drawing was similar as well; upon researching the two, I found they are definitely different actors.",r
20,31 August 2013,kosmasp,8, Wanna see something really ... not so scary?,"Trust in Pixar when it comes to kids movies with unconventional stories behind them. Who'd have thought that a movie about Monsters could be kid friendly? Pixar apparently and it does work quite well. I haven't watched the recently (conviniently released just before the sequel hit the cinema screens) re-vamped 3D version of the movie, but I'm pretty sure they did a good job on that too.",e

23,5 December 2020,UniqueParticle,10, Loved as a kid still do at 28!,This is one of the best movies ever created by Pixar that makes me feel good! I had toys of some of the characters those were fond memories to me maybe cause I'm an aspie; I crave being different. John Goodman and Billy Crystal shine so well I appreciate them in this and all they're other roles! So many great lines that still hold up as charming awesomeness! I'm glad I decided to watch this after a tough day really cheered me up.,=
24,17 January 2003,xbabe82517,10, the most colourful movie I've ever seen!,"As I'm 20 years old I wasn't very enthusiastic when one of my friend's brought Monsters Inc over to watch one night. I've never been into what I once thought were kids movies. I couldn't get into A Bug's Life or the Toy Story movies (though they were just as well-made) but when I saw Monsters Inc I was amazed. The colours are beautiful and the monsters actually have individual personalities that you can form an opinion about. My personal favourite is Sully - the way the bond grows between him and Boo is wonderful to watch, and he's such a tender, caring character. It's the only animated movie that has ever truly moved me - the ending brought a tear to my eye. I cannot find any fault with this movie and I fell in love with it the first time I saw it. I'm now the proud owner of the DVD and it's definitely one of my favourite movies ever. Anyone who hasn't seen it should - it's brilliant.",t
25,12 July 2017,Top_Dawg_Critic,10, Another Disney top animation!,"Monsters Inc. does for monsters what Toy Story did for toys. Yet another Disney top animation that my kids and I can see over and over again, and a classic that should be in everyone's DVD collection. I feel Disney has mastered pairing up the voice actors with their animated characters, and in this case, an excellent choice casting Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Mary Gibbs and Steve Buscemi. Loved this animation and it's a perfect 10/10 from me!",t
26,24 June 2006,the_holc,10, What a creative masterpiece!!!,"This movie is one of the most brilliant, creative and intelligent animated movies of all time, along with all the other Pixar Animation Studios' Movies. The characters are hilarious (Billy Crystal as Mike Wazowski and John Goodman as Sulley was brilliant) and heartfelt, and the movie exposes raw sensitivity with the separation of Sulley and Boo. The animation is incredible, the humor is witty and the storyline is flawless. This movie should be seen by any Pixar fan, Billy Crystal or Goodman fan, or anyone who just plain likes funny movies, lighthearted ones. Pixar, you've done it again, made a brilliant epic masterpiece! Congrats! Watch out for another appearance by John Ratzenberger (Hamm, P.T.Flea etc.). Hint: Himalayas! Overall, loved it! And I can't see why anyone else wouldn't either. Something for everyone!",_
27,18 February 2002,zetes,9, Pixar's glowing reputation takes yet another step forward,"First came Toy Story. It was cute, but lacked bite. The technology was new, and Pixar was still experimenting. Next came A Bug's Life. It was remarkable. Then came Toy Story 2. Even better! Now here is their fourth feature: Monsters Inc. I'm not sure that it's better than Toy Story 2, but at the very least it's equal. It doesn't compare with that film in terms of hilarity. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, is one of the funniest films of the past several years, if not the funniest. However, Monters Inc. has a couple of advantages over TS2 (and, I promise you, it is at least as funny as any other film from 2001). First, the animation is even better than TS2. What? What did you say? Shrek? Ugh, don't even mention that waste of hard-drive space. Monsters Inc. is simply gorgeous in its color schemes. And the movement of the characters is so smooth it looks almost as if it were just the best stop-motion animation ever created. In the film, there is a Japanese restaurant that the monsters go to that's named after the great stop-motion master Roy Harryhausen. I'm sure he'd be stunned at the accomplishment. Second, it has a couple of the most exciting sequences in animation history, especially the climactic sequence in the door room. That's a scene that'll go down in the books. And, third, it's perhaps the first Disney film since Dumbo to be touching, but not cloying. Although some people have told me that the one song in TS2 made them cry, I personally was cringing through that number. There's a scene in Monsters Inc. that honestly made me cry. Generally, that's not much. I'm easily moved. However, I don't fail to notice if a film is emotionally manipulative. That's not the case here. The only other Disney moment that really touched me that deeply is the ""Baby Mine"" song from Dumbo. I think that the only people who don't cry during that song are convicts on death row. I really loved the characters in Monsters Inc. The relationship that develops between Sully and Boo is truly touching. It's developed in a very natural way. And it certainly helps that Boo is easily the cutest kid in the universe, even if she's not real. There were a lot of ""aww""s in the theater, but they were coming from college students, not maddening parents trying to get their kids to pay attention. Oh! And did I mention that the film's villain is one of Disney's best? He's a chameleon-like monster named Raymond, voiced by Steve Buscemi. Sure, his motives aren't all that interesting, but I love the way he moves. It's amazing. And his face is so expressive, but not too expressive like the characters in, say, ahem, Shrek.",u

The monsters in this town work at a factory that can put them in any child's closet world wide. Screams power the city and are collected via these portals. But strangely enough, any contact with a child also scares the monsters, let alone the thought that one should come back thru the door into their city. The pressure is on Sulley and his one-eyed partner, Mike, to keep their number one ranking at work. Randall will to anything to get that number one spot, even... Although this movie is not meant for real young children, all will enjoy the story. The animation is top rate, so well done you can see his the texture of his fur and the scales on his skin.

They have not yet disappointed and there films are always perfect. They missed a few things in Cars. But smashed away by worries away with Ratatouille. They haven't made one bad film. Just by the knowledge of Monsters Inc being made by Pixar should be enough for anyone to see this. Again another superb animated movie.,

The original story it has is amazing that you need a moment to think about it and appreciate it. It is a movie for all ages and a great family movie. I watched it so many times with my family and till today we laugh at its jokes and creativity. Sully and Mike wazowski are iconic and full of humor characters that I grew up upon. John Goodman and Billy Crystal are a dynamic duo throughout the entire movie, Steve Buscemi gives a great performance as the villain Randall. I just love this movie so much that I can talk about it's jokes for days. I highly recommend this movie for all animated movie fans and for Pixar fans to watch it again.

From the amazing voice acting to the amazing animation even for the time. This movie is just classic and nobody can hate it. I love the story and the clever designs and quirks behind it all. It's just amazing story telling and brilliant design work as always from Pixar. Mike is easily one of my favourite characters of all time and I love his so much. Billy Crystal is absolutely brilliant and his energy is what makes Mike such a great character. I would say this movie is amazing but everyone should know that by now, everyone who loves movies has seen this film and it will be forever a timeless classic!

38,28 November 2001,Hitchcoc,9, Very Creative,"I had heard a lot about this before I went (which I hate), but it was still a pleasant surprise. What I loved was the workaday world of the monsters with their factory, their doors, their business, so like the corporate life of the non-monster world. The character's have gentleness, commitment, and a positive view of the world. While some of it is scary (the whole premise of monsters in the closet is scary anyway), it walks a nice line between being too saccharine and too violent. There are some great lines, and the imaginative world created and based on the scream/energy concept is quite clever. For those that take three year olds to movies, I don't know many that don't have something that would upset someone this age. This film is about monsters. They can't be too tame or they will lose their monsterness.",
39,2 November 2001,Quinoa1984,7, Entertaining and imaginative 4th film from Pixar,"Monsters Inc., another fine animated movie from the folks at Pixar takes a turn from toys and bugs and goes for something most kids and adults can identify with (adults may have to reach back in time though for that one), being afraid of what's behind the closet at night.  It turns out, in this film, that monsters do lurk behind the closet, and they scare kids as a power resource to give electricity to Monstropolis where the monsters live. 2 of the scarers include Sully (John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), who have it good in their job until a mishap occurs- a little child crawls through to the other side and creates a different type of adventure for the two monsters.",
40,27 December 2015,anaconda-40658,8, Laughter is the Best Medicine.,"Monster's Inc. (2001): Dir: Pete Docter / Voices: Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Jennifer Tilly, John Ratzenberger: Delightful animation about change in attitudes and lifestyles. It regards the manufacturing of doors that portal the monsters into a child's room to scare them. The screams power their city. Top scare is Sully, a big blue hairy creature coached by a green eyeball with limbs named Mike. The villain the lizard-like Randall who can blend in with his surroundings. Central plot regards a little girl who accidentally enters their world, and Sully and Mike's struggle to conceal her. Amusing idea trails into formula. Inventive conclusion with imaginative directing by Pete Docter. Terrific vocal work by John Goodman and Billy Crystal as Sully and Mike. Sully is famed as the top scare monster while Mike is sort of his manager. Now they are met with a dilemma to help this young girl and discover that laughter is a much more powerful energy. Steve Buscemi voices Randall in what is the standard villain but his punishment fits the crime with amusing results. Jennifer Tilly voices a Meduca-like figure who acts as the romantic interest to Mike. The role is perhaps the weakest in the film. John Ratzenberger makes a great cameo voicing the Abominable Snowman who desires a change in the perception of him. Theme visualizes that there is more power in love than fear. Score: 8 ½ / 10",

Well, my personal taste differs a little, there are some other films from this studio that I prefer and that I like more (Inside Out, Up and Wall-E are some of them), but that is a matter of personal taste and not properly a matter of merit.

47,29 December 2020,CubsandCulture,10, Introduced a major talent,"Pete Doctor would go onto helm several other Pixar projects-Up, Soul, Inside Out etc.-most of which are absolute top tier Pixar. I would go as far as to say that Doctor has a stronger filmography than Lasseter. His work is truly multifaceted and conceptual. Monsters, Inc. is no different. The film can be read in several ways-as metaphor for the fossil fuel crisis, a cautionary parable about capital's greed or abstract musing the relative power of emotion fear, angst vs. joy laughter. The story is endlessly inventive in its genre and blurs the boundary between fantasy, sci-fi. It's a buddy comedy, a heist plot, a fish out of water story and a coming of age tale wrapped together in some of the fastest 90 minutes in cinema. It is funny, charming, and delivers even a few scares.",

51,28 September 2005,lee_eisenberg,10, I loved this movie...and I don't even like Disney.,"One of the ways that I rank a really good movie is one that gives us a new perspective on our own world. ""Monsters, Inc."" is one such movie. Set in Monstropolis, the movie shows that monsters are in fact not much different from humans. The two main monsters are one-eyed, diminutive Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and furry behemoth James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (John Goodman). They work at Monsters, Incorporated, where everyone's job is to go into children's bedrooms, roar at them, and record the screams - which they use to power the city. When a little girl accidentally gets into Monstropolis, they not only have to do everything possible to hide her from the authorities, but they discover a bizarre conspiracy.",

As a kid you obviously believed there were monsters hiding in your closets waiting to scare you, well in this, they only do it because it is their jobs. The film mainly focuses on one of the best scaring monsters and his best friend. John Goodman as James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan and Billy Crystal as Mike Wazowski are just the perfect characters for this film. Basically a door (used to get to the closet of kids) is left behind, so that Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) could cheat and become best monster. Anyway, out of the door comes a little human girl, and Sulley is nearly caught hiding her. He now has to get back to Monsters, Inc. Without anyone spotting the kid. Also starring James Coburn as Henry J. Waternoose III, Jennifer Tilly as Celia, Toy Story's John Ratzenberger as The Abominable Snowman and Frank Oz as Fungus. It won the Oscar for Best Original Song for ""If I Didn't Have You"" by Randy Newman, and it was nominated for Best Animated Feature, Best Music, Original Score for Randy Newman, and Best Sound Editing, and it won the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film. It was number 30 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 53 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!",

It's very amusing that they show the monsters in a room where they would have different doors leading to a room in different parts of the human world. The world's top scarer is James P. Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) who is known to friends, family and fans as Sulley. His assistant is the little one-eyed green ball Mike Wasizoki (Billy Crystal) in which they are partners no matter what (like Shrek and Donkey).

These are magic doors made by monsters to enter any closet door in the world! However, they should avoid scaring teenagers and adults who are too old to be scared by monsters, or who could expose the monster world and put them out of business (if Monsters University did not already give you that hint). After working their way up from the mailroom for about 3 1/2 years (they were expelled from Monsters U. for Sulley cheating at the Scare Games and Mike trespassing into a test door and both of them later destroying it with too much scare energy from adults), Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan have become the top scarer team at Monsters Inc. for 11 months straight. Just like how every plane needs a co-pilot, every scarer needs an assistant.

It centres on two monsters at a company whose job it is to scare children because the monster world is powered by the screams of children. Now that is a really inventive idea. But their world is thrown into disarray when a child called Boo gets out (with monsters believing children are toxic) and our two heroes have to get her back, all while not being found out and uncovering a wider conspiracy.

I like animated films but this should've received a golden globe for best picture or something. Its about a monster with blue-fur named ""Sulley"" has a companion or something named ""Mike"" and they hear of a commercial called Monsters, Inc. where a factory, Monsters Incorporated is aimed for the monsters to fear children in their closets. They soon discover a small toddler named ""Mary"" or ""Boo"" and all she seemed to do is do ""baby-talk"" and the reason why she is doing that was because between the character and the real actress were both two and a half so she couldn't talk yet but she was potty-trained. And the reason why Sulley was so scared of Boo was because she was a different specious, other monsters were afraid of her, too and they think she could do anything she wants but to wreak havoc. The next day, Sulley and Mike get used to Boo and dresses her up as a tiny little toddler monster to keep a disguise. Although Mike has a somewhat girlfriend named who'd he call ""Scoompchie-Poo"" but broke up with him because he ignored her birthday party all because of the havoc-like child. Boo soon needed to go to the bathroom but seems to have a pretty secret fear of ""Randall"" the monster next to the ""top scarer"" Sulley. She soon escapes and Sulley and Mike set off for a wild, crazy misadventure to look for her. They soon found her in a serious of normal pre-schoolers and which Boo calls Sulley ""kitty"" as her favorite monster found the monsters. It's a little disappointing to see a kid be upset over a monster scaring her off so badly on the set but this is a spoiler and you know why?? Because Sulley is seriously the top scarer of Monsters, Inc. but she soon got used to Sulley and Randall and has no fear over them anymore.

The idea of children as energy sources is the core of the film and possibly the main reason why it succeeds so impressively. The doors as means of transit from the monster world into the human world. The simulators where the not so experienced monsters can improve their abilities. It all oozes creativity. Another strength of this film is that its supporting characters are at least as interesting as the two monsters in the lead. I don't think we need to talk about Mike and Sully much. Their actions and presence speak for themselves. One is huge, furry and truly scary, yet kind-hearted, the other is tiny, slippery (at least that's what he looks like, like a frog), always funny and obviously a bit of a womanizer. And yet, they're best friends. Beyond these two, the monster world includes creatures of all sizes, shapes and colors, so they're a feast visually, but with some the writers also succeeded to make them truly entertaining and effective. The two antagonists are really a scary presence, thanks to their looks with all those tentacles for example on Coburn's character or their ability to turn invisible (Buscemi). Two more I liked: One would be Mike's girlfriend who gave me a true LOL moment when she talks during the date about how she may be interested in a shorter haircut and we see those snakes that actually are her hair go into full panic mode for a moment. The other is the poor Monster Inc. worker who got showered and sheared when they discover a baby sock on his back. His reaction when there is one on his back again later into the film was pretty hilarious. Well done. The exterminators were pretty hilarious too, even if you didn't see any physical trademarks on them as they were all covered by their huge uniforms. There's just so many great characters and I'm certainly forgetting some. Already all those they see when they go to work. Thankfully Sully kept Mike from taking the car, otherwise we would have missed all of these.",

158,24 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9, Monsters Inc showcases the imagination and originality of Pixar's early days.,"We all have films we grew up with, earning a sense of nostalgia that may skew the true reflection of the film. Monsters Inc is one of those. It's a little rough around the edges, but the finished product will always be one that I will truly appreciate. Monstropolis is powered by energy garnered from children's screams. Sully and Mike go to work just like any normal day, except they accidentally let a child into the world of monsters. Normal day has now just taken a turn for the more eventful. Comedy ensues with various antagonists being revealed and a surprising touching ending that packs a punch to the heart. One of the greatest additions to the animation genre, this flick shows that pure imagination is able to extend its captivation beyond a good narrative and aesthetically pleasing visuals. It's all in the details! Explaining how the door system works, why the city needs screams, showing the partnership between the scarer and their companion. It fills in all the gaps to complete a greater picture, adding that finesse. The world doesn't feel populated for the sake of it, it naturally breathes life through the art of animation. It's what Pixar is famous for. I loved how they deconstructed the ""monsters in the closet"" theme, which most definitely appeals to all audiences. John Goodman and Billy Crystal were the perfect voice actors, I cannot envisage anyone else replacing them. Sully and Mike are John and Billy. It's a done deal. Irreplaceable. The dialogue between them was intuitive and felt seamless. Quick banter with boundless quotes...""put that thing back where it came from!"". Randall was a memorable villain that was underplayed, not overly sinister which I appreciated. Certain scenes were rushed, like Mike coming back from the Himalayas, but it's not a major detriment. Monster's Inc just screams imagination. Its ingenuity and originality will appeal to everyone and is a stepping stone for cementing Pixar as one of the best animation studios.",
159,24 July 2006,BaronBl00d,8, Coming Out of the Closet,"Great Pixar animated film about two monsters living in Monstropolis - a land outside human land where monsters of all sorts live. Power is generated by the screams of children from Monsters, Inc. - a factory where doors of small children are presented in assembly-line fashion for monsters to walk through and scare children. I was overwhelmed with the concept of the film for its incredible imagination, innovation, and creativity. The folks at Pixar always seem to be able to pull films like this off with ease. At the heart of this film is the friendship of one huge, all-time(almost) scare monster and his assistant - voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal respectively. The characters are penned to fit the voices like hands to gloves. The puns and funny wordplay, particularly by Crystal, are an added bonus and raises much of this as just being another kid's movie. It isn't. What happens? Well, a child manages to come in to the monster world and chaos and fun ensue, but also an emotional quality is created with the depth of characterization of Sully(Goodman). The additional voices by Bob Peterson, James Coburn, and oily Steve Buschemi - not to mention Pixar stalwart John Ratzenberger as the Abominable Snowman(monsters like these had been banished - love the concept again!) greatly enhance the film. But it is the magical animation which seems real more often than not that really propels the engine of this film. This is impressive entertainment from a company that knows what entertainment is all about. In one scene, if you look closely, you will see the child in her room and have a small toy of a clown fish - a couple years before Pixar released Finding Nemo. Love the clever nature of these folks.

Everything about this is wonderful, from the essentially Pixar concept to the warm, sentimental relationships at its core. Even the animation has held up quite well, which isn't always the case with these early CG efforts: humans still look a bit wonky, but most of the cast seems drawn straight from the pages of a Caldecott winner and that kind of bright, absurd character works beautifully. John Goodman and Billy Crystal carry most of the heavy-lifting as Mike and Sulley, blue collar creatures with an easy, free-flowing rapport, but three-year-old Mary Gibbs threatens to steal the scene every time she gets the chance with her adorable almost-words and penetrating good cheer. Exceedingly well-balanced, with the kind of imagination that keeps mouths gaping and so much heart, even the boogeyman might have to fight back a tear or two.

John Goodman excels at Sully, which is obvious, but the true standouts of the film are Crystal's Mike Wazowski and Buscemi's Randall. The animation is done quite well, and the world they built throughout is absolutely extraordinary and the exact kind of limitless imagination you would expect from such a classic Disney flick. The film is quite funny, and has its fair share of emotional and tender moments, both of which I rather appreciate. It isn't Pixar's best, but due to the talent involved, the incredible worldbuilding, and just a sheer sense of direction and fun characters- Monsters Inc. proves to be one memorable film, and one you never can get tired of, no matter how many times you watch it.

The story is about an alternate world where monsters gain energy for their existence by getting screams from children by scaring them after entering their world from their closet doors. The company, ""Monsters, Inc"", captures this energy and Sully, voiced by John Goodman, is the highest energy producer for them. His friend Mike, voiced by Billy Crystal, is his assistant. The evil character is the runner-up color-shifting monster that is behind Sully in energy points, but is found out to be cheating by capturing kids and extracting the screams out of them with a machine. One kid, named Boo by Sully, escapes and Sully and Mike have to figure out how to get her back to her real world and expose the evil monster's doings to the company. They do a lot of retread simple ""TV show""-type of humor around this story which makes the movie not as good as it could have been, but the animation is superb and unique enough to keep you interested until the end. The 3D is good and not over-bearing showing the perspective and size of some of the animated sets where the characters work in. This is not the best of the Disney animated films because of the simplistic story, but there is the usual expert craftsmanship that has definitely gone into this like so many of the others. The computer animation is very good despite it's 2001 release and I have to say that this is a worthwhile effort in the Disney cannon despite it's shortcomings in the story.",

176,6 July 2003,rosscinema,7, Fun for all ages,"This is another enjoyable animated feature from the Pixar studios and one of the reasons they can entertain a more older audience is the subtle references that they make from other sources. The story is about a world called Monstropolis where monsters live and their world is powered by the heat of childrens screams. Monsters go through doors that lead into the closets of children in the real world and its the monsters job to frighten children so that their scream can be harnessed and used for power. The top scream collector is Sulley (John Goodman) who is a big hairy monster and he works in the factory that builds the doors and where collectors are to pass through. Sulleys best friend is a big walking eyeball named Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and they discover that a human child named Mary and nicknamed Boo (Mary Gibbs) has passed through into Monstropolis and together they try and get her back but the alert has gone out and the monsters of Monstropolis think that humans are toxic and can kill you. Its always fun to watch these films and its because the computer animation that Pixar does is so detailed and intricate. Each hair on Sulley seems to have a life of its own. The stories are engaging as well as they seem to be about simple things that we can all relate to. Monsters waiting in the closet, we have all grown up thinking about these things and its fun to watch these old phobias come to life. One of the subtle references I was talking about is where Mike is eating in a restaurant called ""Harryhausens"". This is of course in reference to the great Ray Harryhausen who is a pioneer in special effects for films. This film also has the Oscar winning song ""If I Didn't Have You"" by Randy Newman and he has become a Pixar staple with his music. Very enjoyable animated feature that has more to offer than just a kids flick. Adults will definitely get a kick out of it as well!",

The basic plot is instantly ingenious enough to appeal to even the most simple-minded of viewers, and it is a delightful satire on humankind's timeless fear of monsters. My favourite in terms of satirical tools is the two pimple-covered adolescent monsters who are so 'in awe' of Sullivan and the other 'scarers', which just puts that brilliant twist to the whole idea. The voices are excellent: Crystal, Goodman and Buscemi are all perfectly cast in their roles and they combine well with the very brilliant animation and clever scripting to produce a very likeable and entertaining film. This is not just one of those animated movies that attempt to lure adults through the use of well-beloved actors (Meg Ryan as Anastasia, one example). It really is enjoyable for the whole families.

Which happens to be the whole point:  It's a business.  At Monsters, Inc., it's the job of all the scariest creatures around to supply the power for the city, which is generated by the screams of the children found on the other side of closet doors.  The bigger the scream, the more power.  From one floor of the factory that is Monsters, Inc., closet doors are affixed, assembly line style, so that the best of the best (or maybe that's the worst of the worst) can step through (it takes them into a child's bedroom) and do their thing.

Much like Toy Story expanded on the childhood fantasy of toys that talk while you're not looking, Monsters, Inc. expands on a darker fantasy, and that is the infamous fear of the monster in the closet.

228,6 December 2011,estreet-eva,9, Underrated among the Pixar offerings.,"""Monsters, Inc."" is among Pixar's best because it constructs a clever, convincing world from the single childhood experience of being afraid of what lies behind the closet door. Pixar opens that door and plunges the viewer into a funhouse mirror of society with puns, inside jokes and pop cultural references (""Scare Different""). Goodman, as his name implies, was an excellent job as the voice actor for the talented but naïve Sully and Buscemi oozes menace as his foil. The plot is sufficiently frightening to drive the story forward and the laughs are high-brow enough for adults and slapstick enough for the kids. In short, one of the few DVDs actually worth owning.",
229,5 May 2002,bsinc,9, Pixar has done it again,"This movie lived up to its expectations. With great ease, I might add. It is slightly different from previous Pixar movies, the fact that it wasn't directed by John Lasseter might have something to do with it:), because I felt that there was less of that universal humor that anyone, be it a 5 year old child or an adult can find funny. But the lack of humor was replaced with a truly touching story and one of the best movie climaxes I have seen in a long time. I also thought that the very, very ending of the movie is nothing less than perfect and I left the cinema with a desire to see the movie again. John Goodman and Billy Crystal were great choices for the main characters, but they could have done more with Steve Buscemi's character, if for anything because he has a very distinctive and likable voice. A great story, nice characters and THE perfect ending make ""Monsters, Inc"" a great movie experience.         ",

I thought the story was perfectly well-written, the laughs are meant to be good laughs, and the cast including John Goodman as Sulley and the incredible Billy Crystal as Mike was perfectly hilarious. The movie is set in a city filled with monsters, and their every-day job is to scare kids through their closet door, in the human world, only to fuel their city with power. But, when a human child enters the monster world, everybody freaks out, and it's up to Mike and Sulley to bring this little girl, with the name of ""Boo"", back home, before ending up in the clutches of the evil chameleon monster Randall. Actually, ""Monsters, Inc."" happens to be my personal favorite Pixar movie. Because the story was well entertaining, but not as entertaining as ""Toy Story"" or ""Nemo"", but well talented at entertainment and laughs. There was actually something that occurred to me that the story was talking about being scared for nothing, because the monsters overreact that kids are dangerous and toxic, and I think it's all in their heads. I think that's a story I'm well impressed at. Wow, I better hurry before a monster pops out in my closet, and scare the hell out of me!

Pixar's focus is not about scaring children but about the act of scaring children: it's a job to the main characters, portrayed as working-class stiffs trying to meet their quotas at an energy supply corporation that uses the kids' screams to produce power. It's a brilliant concept, naturally, but Pixar takes it further by creating a fully realized metropolis that exists as a sort of cross between the New York of the forties and the big city in any Marvel Comic, inhabited with pleasingly shaped creatures that complement the ambience and sleek lines of the settings. As in the `Toy Story' series there's as much for grownups as for children and repeated viewings seem almost mandatory (an inviting prospect); but this time around, there's a healthy skepticism towards corporations that's clearly adult.

What I love about this movie most of all is the truly original premise. This world where monsters are real and they power up their cities by bottling up the screams of frightened children is wonderfully inventive and it lends itself to some incredibly creative character designs. It's all so well animated that you might just forget that what you're seeing on the screen isn't live action footage (particularly the scenes involving snow). Another particularly strong element in my opinion is the voice casting. The voices match the monsters so well that the models must have been modified or done after the recordings were done to match the voices, mannerisms and dialogue so well. Either that or we've got some incredibly dedicated, intelligent and talented individuals with an incredible amount of forethought behind the scenes at Pixar.",

260,10 November 2001,stevenleadbetter,5, Not much new to chew on here.,"I have been heard to mention my anticipation of this title in recent weeks. Now that I have finally got my peepers on it, I have to say that it wasn't really my cup of tea. I have a three-year-old son who is difficult to please as far as his entertainment is concerned and, suffice to say, he lost interest in this within half an hour. He adores Toy Story 2 and Tarzan, and can watch them (and has) repeatedly. The fear that a large proportion of ticket-buyers have come to view the now obligatory Attack Of The Clones' trailer is well founded it seemed, with large numbers of the audience leaving before the commencement of the movie. This may account for it's auspicious first weekend record-breaking figures. Anyhow, Star Wars aside. Monsters Inc is very pretty, very cute, very Disney, very Pixar. I first heard about it after buying the Tigger Movie DVD for my son. It seemed quite brilliant at the time, what little I gleaned from the all too brief trailer. I won't ruin the plot for you, but it is basically Toy Story with different characters. Instead of toys that secretly lead a life away from their owners, we now have monsters that are thought of as figments of the child's imaginings. They survive off the screams of children and around the clock they sneak through children's closet, and scare the bejeezus out of them. (Some have more success than others) Billy Crystal and John Goodman are excellent as the main protagonists but the rest of the characters are second rate and fail to inspire any feeling about them. There is a scene reminiscent of Toy Story 2 (Sorry to harp back to this again, it is difficult not to when both films or so similar) when Woody and the gang are trying to save Jessie at the Airport, jumping from suitcase to suitcase. This time we have a countless collection of doors which are used to enter the bedroom of the children the monsters scare, thousands of them hanging from conveyors. This makes for an entertaining chase, but it's been done before, as has most of the movie really. Perhaps some insight from Nick Park or the rest of Aardman Animation would be of some benefit, as their films are quite astonishing in their originality and timing. A picture that is immense fun, but as a wisened old Disney buff, I feel it is more of the same immense fun that we have seen many times before.",
261,10 November 2001,Brogan,10, Where the Wild Things Are.,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** MONSTERS INC. reminded me of the classic children's book by Maurice Sendak, ""Where the Wild Things Are.""  Both stories are about the imagination of monsters living in children's closets, but these monsters aren't dangerous, they are harmful and friendly.  Where in ""Wild Things Are"" the monsters enjoy the company and playtime with the main child character, Max. MONSTERS INC.  the monsters are actually terrified by the presence of a child or anything that is human for that matter.  In fact, the monsters are more afraid of the children than the children are of them, nice irony. MONSTERS INC. is about two power plant factory workers in the city of Monsteroplois, James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal).  Sulley is the number one monster frightner for the factory, as Mike is Sulley's loyal assistant, roommate, and friend. The monsters have assign doors placed in front of them which leads them to the closets of real world into children's bedrooms so they can scare the children. The monsters of the city need the screams a child gives when they see a monster, that is how they get their energy.  The film even does a witty sub-plot to the real-life California rolling blackout energy crisis.  Sulley is admired by his co-workers and his boss Henry J. Waternoose (James Coburn), while Mike has a flirting romance with the company secretary, Celia (Jennifer Tilly). Everybody likes the winning duo except for the jealous Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) a chameleon-like monster who adapts his skin to his surroundings so he can hide. Randall has been putting in unofficial ""scare hours"" so he can be the top monster at Monsters Inc. It's when Sulley accidently opens up one of Randall's closet doors to find a small girl, who Sulley calls ""Boo"" has enter into the monster world.  There is a eariler scene that is horrifying realistic in today's time when a child's sock is stuck to a monster and the decontamination a monster goes through for his and everyone else's protection.  With Boo in the monster world, things can be catastrophic. Sulley and Mike try to hide Boo (even dressing her up like a monster) as they look through the billions of closet doors, to find the right one to her bedroom, as Randall wants Boo for a diabolical scheme that he plans to use her for.  But it when Sulley and Mike try to help Boo find her way home, that they begin to both feel like parents and want to help and protect the infant child. After getting a sour taste of this year's computer animated films (yes I'm talking about SHREK), MONSTERS INC. proves that Pixar and Disney animation is a winning combination and shouldn't be competed with.  Where SHREK was full of potty jokes and mugging the camera, MONSTERS actually tells a story that has a lot of depth and meaning behind it.  SHREK wanted to do cut-down jokes (especially to Disney films), MONSTERS INC. instead takes a different path and does jokes about life in general and the monster's lives are similar to our own. I found MONSTERS INC. to be another winner from Pixar, who are so far 4 to 1 on my scoreboard for successful computer animated films (only Dreamworks SHREK being the only point for the other team).  If people are asking themselves, ""gee there's SHREK, FINAL FANTASY, and JIMMY NEUTRON, how can MONSTERS INC. be any better?""  Well that's simple, it's like saying how is a ride at Disneyland better than a ride at a carnival.  Where a lot of film studios and companies are adapting to computer animated films, Disney always manages to stay a few steps ahead of it's competitor's.  First, look at the millions of hairs that cover the wooly Sulley, the scenes when he runs you can see the hairs gently move from the breeze.  Second, the human child of Boo looks more realistic than any of the generic humans in SHREK. Third, there is much more color with the Pixar films, I figured this out when ANTZ and A BUG'S LIFE were released three years ago.  Finally, the messages and morals behind the Pixar/Disney films are more original, where MONSTERS tells the viewer that don't judge a book by it's cover, that the most terrifying looking things can be the most caring.  And that it's difficult to be a parent but with teamwork and care, it can work!  Where SHREK is doing the things aren't what they seem moral which Disney did 60 years ago with DUMBO, and DUMBO was much more cuter, charming, and more touching than a obnoxious loud orge. It doesn't surprise me that MONSTERS INC. was directed by former SIMPSONS producer David Silverman, and Pixar veteran Peter Docter.  Disney had some competition this year for computer animated films, while Dreamworks had a royal flush, Disney won by having the royal flush straight, and should win the Oscar for best Animated film this year.  Until the magic and wonder of Mr. Potter is released, this is one film that Potter fans (children and children at heart) will love and wanting more, just like I did!  ***** (out of five)",

273,17 June 2015,CMTiago,8," Funny and inventive, it delivers the Pixar mark","I've been wanting to review this movie for some time now, and that is because Monsters Inc. is already a beloved classic from the company that makes us dream like no other. With this movie it's no different. We are introduced to a world that is inhabited by monsters who are just trying to live their normal lives in a happy society. Our main characters are Mike and Sully, two creatures that work at Monsters Inc. , whose goal is to power the city with children's screams. When a little girl crosses the threshold of both worlds, trouble will arise as friendships and the overall faith of Monstropolis (the city's name) will be on the line. Providing a perfect mixture of comedy and warmth, this movie delivers an entertaining ride that will leave you laughing out loud, as well as invested in the emotional trials the characters goes through. The film's lasting message is also one of the best in showing us that through a happy spirit we can overcome anything. Pixar at their best, Monsters Inc. is a must see movie for any animation and ,most of all, Pixar enthusiast.",
274,7 November 2022,ForTheMostPart1999,9, Imaginative monster movie,"A very clever and well thought out film by Pixar animation studios that uniquely represents the made-up theory of monsters in a kid's closet. The film has a neat and fun amount of colorful characters and even some ""scary"" looking ones like Randall (voiced by the talented Buscemi) and Waternoose. Crystal portrays Mike Wazowski hilariously and Goodman does some good enough seriousness (as well as some humor) with Sully. This was a good childhood classic of mine as well. The doors leading into the human world electronically I think is an interesting idea. The scene near the end with every single door in one place was a scene I really liked when I was younger. Overall, it is a quite an ingenious movie and another good one for the early years of Pixar (their fourth movie they've made).",

The two monsters must find a way to get her home. Along the way, the human girl becomes friends with these two monsters. Eventually word spreads though out the monster world to find the human girl at all costs. Since it's a Disney movie it has a happy ending. The bad guys get what they had coming to them. The monster world is saved and a new power source is found to power their world.",

They have films that appeal to kids as well as adults, and this film is no different. The characters are memorable, the jokes are great, the premise is original, the animation was great for the time, and the voice acting is fantastic. Most kids films don't get parents to like it, but I have heard many older viewers of this movie say that this is their favorite of the Pixars. With this film there is very little not to like. Many people complain that the Boo character is cliché in its cuteness. I answer that statement with the words ""What now? Is nothing allowed to be cute anymore?"". This movie had effort, and time put into it which is a trademark of Pixar.",

They haven't made a bad movie yet (although I didn't care as much for 'A Bug's Life'), and this movie is no exception.  This movie has a sophisticated sense of humor, and is just as satirical as it is endearing.  Sure, you know the plot of the movie and the final result around 10 minutes (I'm guessing, i didn't look at my watch at all during the movie), but who cares?  The movie is full of humor and great graphics.  Unlike 'Shrek,' which I noticed somebody liked better, this movie wears its heart on its sleeve.  'Shrek' tried to make itself out to be an attack on Disney (and it was good for the first 20 minutes), but then it turns into an overly-sappy movie worthy of Disney. This movie never pretends to be bitter and mean, but is a bit tongue-in-cheek.  ",

But I went to see it in 3D (not really necessary, although not awful) and I finally found out why this movie is a movie to love. This movie is an original story, and just how often do we get any of those? The monsters in the film work at Monsters Incorporated, where they have to scare little human children for electric power.You see them frightening human children who equally terrify them. One of these kids accidentally gets into their world and all hell breaks lose. The characters are witty, emotional and very well put together. John Goodman voices Sully, the monster who finds Boo and decides that he will help her return to her world, and his hardy heavy voice fits the big blue monster with a heart made of love. Billy Crystal voices Mike Wazowski, the little green fireball who's chalk full of craziness, and Steve Buscemi voices Randall, the slimy purple lizard like monster who stirs up trouble for the heroes and their little girl.",

289,5 September 2016,datautisticgamer-74853,8, Scares for the turn of the century... or not?,"In a review that I had deleted, I described Monsters, Inc. as somewhat disappointing for its lack of unsettling imagery, with only a handful of scenes that actually made me jittery. But know that I have seen this movie again, I only now realized what this was meant to be; a family film that places peeving imagery aside and leaves us with some well executed jokes and designed characters, especially James Sullivan (whose fur rendering is so strong even to this day). Sure, some of the humor is catered more towards the younger audiences, and some aspects of the monster world aren't explored well (such as how monsters of all designs share the same shape of toilets, vehicles, et cetera, excluding those already explored in its chronological predecessor) but they will focus on that more than the subplots such as Celia's relationship with Mike. The roles are (no pun intended) monstrously performed to what they were intended, and perhaps more, which can't be found in a lot of movies specifically targeted at kids today. Now that I realize what I skipped in my previous review, I feel as despondent as Boo when Sulley returns her to her bedroom. If not for the questionable world they live in, this is a film that I am complacent to say that families must watch it.",

It eventually found its way into my Top Ten and it has stayed there ever since, not moving much at all. No one but John Goodman and Billy Crystal could have done the voices of Sully and Mike, and James Coburn was excellent as Mr. Waternoose. **Possible spoiler ahead** One main character, known as ""Boo"" is the only human character in the movie. She is maybe 2 years old, I'm not really sure. But she is really cute. SHe can't talk very well, being so young, and the movie makers had a hard time with Mary Gibbs, who provided the voice of Boo.

Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, Waking life, Shrek, Blood: the last vampire, Final Fantasy, is there even room for Monsters inc? The plot is cute, but to quote my designated driver: ""that's such a bootleg ending!"" Shrek was predictable and fun and funny. Monsters Inc was predictable. Period. Shrek also creatively used conventional cinematographic techniques, Monsters Inc just showed you what was happening. The richness of expressions was also limited by the lack of development. Shrek made you feel Cameron Diaz beneath the digital expressions of princess Fiona. Sully only gave you cliches expressions-growl, surprise, sadness, resolution, endearment. You see what I mean?

I liked the movie, but I didn't love it.  There was just something missing and I'm not sure what it was. Maybe it was the fact that there were no really well-developed supporting characters.  It was ALL Mike and ALL Sully.  And that wasn't enough! Randall was a good villain; he just wasn't villanous enough! Maybe the monsters weren't scarey enough. . . or cuddly enough.  They seemed to be mostly potatoes, slugs or sausages with an unusual number of eyes. And the boss monster was a rip-off from one of the mutant toys in TOY STORY. Maybe there weren't enough in-jokes to keep adults entertained.  Oh, sure, I liked the STALK/DON'T STALK crossing light.  And I saw the TOY STORY doll but I'm not sure whether it was Woody or the cowgirl.  And I caught the Oscar Meyer jingle line.  But I wanted more. Maybe I was waiting for a song and dance number.  Randy Newman wrote the music.  Why can't we have more than a sing-along over the credits? And where were the Pixar out-takes at the end? I'm not sure the kids in the audience liked the movie so much either.  The kid sitting next to me knew who all the monsters were; she shouted their names out to her dad who was sitting down the row.

The characters, the musical score, the song in the end credits, the story, the feelings, the intensity, the laughs, the truth behind the huge business of the whole city, everything about this film still amazes me even today. Mike and Sulley are yet another one of the most incredible and fearless pairs of best friends I've ever seen, sure they may seem a bit hesitant about a few new things they come across but they still march through them because they're best friends and when it comes to dealing with something they didn't even know was happening they still stick by each other and make things right again, that's what best friends do. The fact that Sulley was willing to do anything to protect Boo as soon as he started warming up to her is really so compelling that it reminds me of myself and how much I'm willing to sacrifice anything for anyone I love because that's what true friends do, when I was a kid I never really understood what Mr. Waternoose was really up to alongside Randall but now that I'm older I now completely understand what their plan really was and harvesting kids for their scream energy is absolutely criminal and cruel. The fact that even today there are still big businesses out there who also just go behind the backs of their employees and have secret ideas to make their own huge profits for themselves and not for the welfare of the community is just cruel and criminal and I'm hoping that the future of it all will be different. If you haven't seen this movie yet than you're completely missing out of something amazing, a film that will show you that not all presidents of big businesses can be trusted and that things that you thought were dangerous may actually be not so bad after all, maybe things that you thought were dangerous are not somethings to be afraid of because maybe they can be your friend and also this film shows you that the monsters you may have feared as a kid might not be so scary after all. It'll even show you that life really is no fun without a good scare and even a good laugh. Monsters, Inc. Is another one of the most classic and most enjoyable Disney films I've ever grown up with and will still never stop watching again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again, Mike, Sulley and Boo will astound and amaze you just like they did for me all these years and they still do now along with every last wacky and wonderful and astounding surprise that this masterpiece has to offer.

Inc is a monstrously good film which kids and adults can relate to,"In my opinion, Monsters Inc. is right up there with the best of Pixar, behind the two Toy Story films, because Monsters Inc. isn't as groundbreaking. But that's where the criticism ends. Monsters Inc. is nearly flawless as an animated feature and I can guarantee that kids will love this film and have fond memories of it. Adults will relate to it as well. The difference between Monsters Inc and rubbish like Scooby Doo is that this doesn't rely on fart-n-urine gags in order to garner laughs. Its humour is always good-natured.",

As with many companies, Monsters, Inc. keeps track of top performers, thus invoking a competitive spirit amongst the monster employees. Things change when Sullivan, also known as Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) stumbles upon a little girl named Boo (voiced by Mary Gibbs) and is forced to face and perhaps overcome his fears.",

342,8 September 2011,djansen24,8, They didn't forget a thing with this movie!,"Well, Pixar did it once again. Simply a great film! As I watched this for the umpteenth time with my 2 boys, I was fascinated with how they tied up all of their loose ends while not forgetting to follow up on the most minute details. Monsters Inc. has all of the trademark elements of a first class Pixar film: good laughs, breathtaking animation, endearing characters (even the villains), and most importantly excellent stories. One has to enter this story with a certain suspension of belief (even by cartoon standards). The plot is absolutely ludicrous, but it takes itself seriously enough to envelope us into its world; in other words, the characters believe what they say. With that sense of incredulity placed to the side, feel free to enjoy the show, because it is a delight from start to finish. The little girl/s playing the voice of ""Boo"" is/are cute as ever (how do they get such good work out of children?). You care about all of the characters and you will probably even shed tears of joy at the end. The only quip I have (and it is a very minor one) is that the all-star Hollywood cast don't try at all to disguise their voices in their portrayals. They pretty much sound just like John Goodman, Steve Buschemi, Billy Crystal, etc. But the drawings and animation of their characters are so perfect that you quickly forget that Billy Crystal is talking and even really think he might just be a one-eyed, green skinned, little ball monster. One of the best elements to the great ambiance of the film the whole take on the ""monster in the closet/under the bed"" common childhood experience. It is an experience just about everyone of us can relate to, but then having it get flipped back on itself and making the monsters out to be just doing a job and being terrified of the kids was a stroke of genius! And wouldn't it be great if we could solve the energy crisis just by laughing more? I would like to live in a world like that... ;o)",

Put them together and you have a guaranteed success. That's exactly what ""Monsters, Inc."" is. These two actors know how do everything. I don't think they even need to be directed anymore. This shows in their dialogue throughout the movie; they never deliver a line incorrectly. Sometimes this movie is intelligent, sometimes it's very funny and other times it's both! The movie is stunning visually. The giant warehouse of doors is impressive. Sully's fur is a sign of how far computer animation has come since the days of ""Toy Story."" The story is very interesting as well and applies to everyone. Who didn't ever think that monsters were hiding in their closets? Pixar has an amazing way of capturing childhood imaginations like this and ""What if our toys were alive?"" that no other studio has ever been able to match.",

He sure did a good job of making people annoyed. The baby was annoying to but very funny. This movie is very entertaining. But could've been better. I just didn't like the idea where monsters were afraid of children but they scare children... That's the part i hate about. But kids will love this movie. some babies might cry... Because of the ""scary"" monsters. But this movie is family fun! Pixar is the best! but i think this movie is a tiny bit overrated. I don't think this movie should be in the top 250 list.

In fact, you can see Buzz Lightyear and Woody in the film if you look closely.  Also, which I find quite hilarious, you can see some forecasting of their next movie, Finding Nemo.  The little girl picks up a fish that looks exactly like Nemo.   Of all the Pixar movies, I would say that Nemo is the best, but Monsters is not far behind.   Both adults and children will love it.  John Goodman, Billy Crystal and Steve Buscemi are outstanding.  If you have never seen a Pixar film, you are really missing out!!!   10 Stars.",

My only problem is with whoever comes up with the marketing stuff for Disney movies.  If you look at the toys etc. that are available, you'd think the movie was ""made"" by Sully and Mike -- when, really, it's Boo who makes it worth going back to again and again.

359,19 May 2004,Elgroovio,10, My favourite comedy,"You've just got to see this film. It will have you bouncing up and down with laughter no matter what age you are. Billy Crystal and John Goodman are perfect as the two main characters of the film Mike Wasowski and James P. Sullivan and so is the rest of the voice-cast which includes James Coburn; this must have been his last film. ""Monsters, inc."" has great jokes and great lines (Randall (the bad monster): Where's the kid you creatin; Mike: First of all it's cretin. If you're gonna threaten me you might as well do it properly). This film also has a great score written by the fabulous musician Randy Newman, and the film's song ""Wouldn't Have Nothing If I Didn't Have You"" won a well deserved Oscar. Hang around for the credits, there are some of the funniest outtakes that you will ever see in your entire life-time. But one of the most interesting things about this film is that it is really unbelievably sweet without being sickly so. Most Disney films are full of sloppy over-sentimentality but this film isn't which shows how little an influence Disney has on Pixar studios. If you want to buy this film on DVD, I strongly suggest that you get the special edition which is made up of two DVDs. It has tons of special features and watching them you will find out that the crew that made this film are really adorable people. If you are feeling miserable, this film will almost surely cheer you up. It is smart without being vulgar which I find very good; people of all ages can watch this film. Films as good as this are very rare so just see it! I drink to the health and long life of Pixar animation studios and the crew behind this film which is undeniably a comedy Classic like ""Some Like It Hot"". See this film and be prepared to experience the time of your life. And remember ""Put that thing back where it came from or so help me"".",

365,17 December 2015,KingCritic,9, Overall fun and memorable.,"Monster's Inc is a large piece of my childhood, and probably yours too. It is original, fun, and best of all a timeless movie. It knows when to create sentiment, or laughter at the right time and how to do it. It is basically defines what makes Pixar such an amazing studio. The movies main heroes are Mike and Sully, and even though they are children scaring monsters, it is extremely glossed over because they funny, honest, and do the best for a being close to alien to them. Besides this movie containing driven and interesting characters, it tells an interesting story that kids and adults alike could enjoy. But something that I believe the movie tries to get across is this: intelligent beings are scared of what they don't understand, and exploit whatever it is to get a resource vital to them and hurt it if they can to get the resource faster and more efficiently. For instance, the movies race of monsters are scared of the humans because they are of a different world and exploit the needed resource (the child's screams) subtly, and when Randall (one of Pixar's top villains) wants to exploit the resource faster he is willing to hurt the humans. Still , you don't need to understand Monster's Inc on a deeper level to enjoy it or love its originality. This is one of my favorite movies ever, and is great for one of any age and I highly suggest watching it.",

I loved the look of the film, and it was great adventure rendered with great comic sense.  The people at Pixar must really love what they do, they haven't sucked yet.  The monsters themselves may be a bit scary for really little kids or the more fraidy-cat prone kids, but the characters are superb.  Great fun all around and very worth seeing.",
368,5 November 2001,Geordie-4,9, Pretty entertaining,"Well, this film is not quite Toy Story.  I found it very entertaining, but it seems odd that Monsters, Inc. is based on how many screams can be extracted from kids owing to their fear but that they turn out to be harmless.

Now I love ""Shrek;"" it had moments of real wit and its target (the Disney empire) was long overdue for a thrashing. But ultimately I was left cold by it. The reason? It was afraid to be a fairy tale. It is true that young people nowadays would not respond well to fairy tales; Disney has transformed  fairy tales into something toxic and false, so new ways of telling them have to be invented. ""Shrek"" told a basic fairy tale story, but peppered it with post-modern references and nudge-nudge jokes to make it clear to is jaded and cynical young audience that it didn't REALLY believe in any of it, it was just having fun.

At the beginning of the movie, all the scarers, scare the children to generate electricity, that scene were totally awesome. When, the machines are crushing the garbage and sulley thinks it crushing Boo also, that time Sulley's expressions makes it funny. The Himalayas which comes in the movie was wonderful because it was very white and plain, it was superb. The Monster costume which was worn by Boo was super and it was a good idea.

The jokes are screamingly (no pun intended) funny, and the dialog is one of my favorite ever. I love every single character (Mike is my favorite), and all the voice acting is superb. The animation is fantastic and the cool twist on ""the monster in the closet"" is fun and very clever. One of my favorite scenes is when Mike and his girlfriend Celia are on a date at Harryhausens (a restaurant in Monstropolis) and Sully comes in with Boo and unintentionally crashes their date and Boo gets loose, it's hilarious havoc, and I love every minute, and of course every other scene in Monster's Inc.

The gags, while mostly for kids hold there own in the adult world, not as tightly as SHREK did, but it works. The sappiness of the movie is drained out by the pure charm of it. Every time I hear PIXAR is making a movie I get as excited as a Star Wars fan about EPISODE II (in which teaser trailer shows up here). While it probably won't turn as many heads as TOY STORY 2 and SHREK, it will be noticed. PIXAR is by far the MOST imaginative studio out there, they cover EVER corner of what would seem to be a CARTOON to make it it's own world! It was almost as if the writers had went into a closet that was left opened by a monster and explored their world and got to know every little crack and stain about the place, then came back here and made a movie about it. I don't want to talk about the goings on of the film because everything is  such a sweet and intelligent surprise. Most of all, it should be noted that I was in the theater with a BUNCH of screaming, talking, loud children, and in any other case I would have been annoyed but MONSTERS, INC. put me in such a cute and loving mood that I couldn't wait to hear the next little kids say, ""Is that man real?"" MONSTERS, INC. ***1/2 (out of ****)",
388,8 May 2006,ajk718,10, pixar has done it again!,"another animated masterpiece by pixar! i actually saw this movie recently when it was shown on the Disney channel, but this was the only time i saw it. unfortunately, i didn't get to see it when it was out in theaters. pixar has made several excellent animated films and monsters inc is surely not an exception. monster inc. is set in the ever famous scream factory where monsters access doors that lead into the rooms of little children in order to scare them while they are sleeping. the screams that result from these children is the energy that makes light bulbs glow and cars drive in the world in which the monster's live. however, trouble and madness ensues when Sulley, the number one frightener, accidentally lets a human child into the monster world. ironically, the monsters are extremely terrified of these kids that they scare routinely because of the belief that all of them are poisonous and carry loads of diseases. However, Sulley and his fellow monster friend, Mike, discover that Boo (the name which they had given to the child) is really very harmless. throughout the movie, sulley and mike attempt to keep boo hidden until tehy can get her back into her door and asleep in her room. however, this is not as easy as they might think!",
389,18 August 2021,jjgreatwhite,9, One of the most Likable Animated Movies of all time,"If I had to describe Monsters Inc. For one word for me it would be likable, it's just such an easy movie to like from the story, to the humor, and to the characters this is just such an easy movie to like. First of all while it is a reusable concept of monsters scaring kids while hiding in their closet they add a twist that they need to power there world with screams and it adds why in a sense while it's wrong to scare kids you see why they do it it's just their job. The next reason why this movie is so likable is the humor which in my personal opinion this is easily Pixar's funniest movie with hilarious running gags, great one liners, and just funny situations for the characters to be in. The final reason why this movie is so likable are the characters Mike and Sulley are such a likable duo with different personalities to compare and contrast to one another and their friendship is fantastic also with Boo the girl who they accidentally left out is not annoying and is funny and adorable together and also there are tons of great characters in this movie to count but I would be here all day telling people what I like about each of them. In the end Monsters Inc. Is a personal favorite of mine because it's just such an easy to like and to rewatch and it is without a doubt in my opinion one of Pixar's best movies. Overall grade= A+.",

407,11 February 2002,ianwarrender,8," This film has style, great humour, a fine plot for kids, great graphics and more, yes go and see it.","First, let me just say that it is a very, very good and funny movie, but I will come back to its many good points. I have to say that as a Pixar / Disney movie it lacked something from the pervious Toy Stories, but at first I could not quite put my finger on the problem. However after reviewing other digital movie I now can see the main problem. Lets start with Titan A.E. digital quality mostly excellent, however no realism in most scenes, other then the people which often seemed cartoonish. Final Fantasy, very, very good graphics the people very real, although the surrounding environment, was the Fantasy. Now Shrek not commenting on the story line, the environment from the grass to the buildings were just perfect, and put the unreal characters in a setting which MADE them real, so we felt that the film was real. Toy Story 1 & 2, again especially in the 2nd the environment was perfect, also because it was in a place which we all recognises (an average city) it made everything seem real. Now finally Monsters Inc, the graphics were another step up from Toy Story 2, however all the realism was gone. This was because of where the film was set, take the scene where Sulley and Wazowski are walking down the street, on the way they pass funny cars, a Jelly Monster, and a giant and you feel that the realism we got in Toy Story is lost. Having said that the world they created was very funny, and for a change you could feel in the graphics Disney's involvement, leading to many cartoonish environments, with a Pixar's touch. Having said all that this film was brilliant, and the graphics on the little girl Boo' we excellent. I could comment on the fact that the story line is very predicable, but it's aimed at kids and so is very easy for them to understand. As I said earlier it is a very funny movie, with a lot more comedy then Toy Story had. All the characters have certain funny quirks and mannerisms, which adds to the laughs. Also I have to say that although John Goodman did a very good job as Sulley, for me Billy Crystal made the movie his own, as the voice of Wazowski bringing more then an extra dimension to the character. Although I have to say I didn't for some reason connect to the characters as I did with Toy Story, but that could just be me. Another thing that I have to point out is the ending, well after the ending, like Toy Story 2 there's funny outtakes, but then there more and takes credits to another level. I would recommend people to go and see the movie just to see the end, and was still sitting even when the screen went black waiting for more. Well to wrap up this review this film has style, great humour, a fine plot for kids, great graphics and more, yes go and see it.",
408,5 April 2020,jonnydmullan,9, Animation at its finest,"Monsters Inc, like Toy Story is also a genius concept. The film works off the premise that children's bedroom closet doors operate as portals that allow monsters through them to scare them and obtain the energy released in the scream to fuel the monster world. I have no idea how this concept was thought up but it sets the movie up for a home run.",
409,13 July 2019,athaggard,9," Hilarious, Smart, and Heartwarming","It has a creative plot of monsters scaring children so that they can power their city and how they work in an office environment.

The humor is hilarious, the title sequence looks neat, Billy and John are great together, Boo is cute, the plot twist where Waternoose was the one behind Randall's schemes was really surprising, and the music by Randy Newman was excellent!",
410,4 November 2001,jpellino,10," Stunning, touching, funny.","Pixar have outdone themselves once again.  Everyone else is an also-ran.  I saw ""Shrek"" for the first time this afternoon on video.  Then I went and bought a ticket to ""Monsters Inc."".  First, this is the second in a disturbing series of coincidences where Pacific Data Images / Dreamworks SKG is first to market with a similar theme to Whatever-Pixar-Has-Announced.  It happened with Antz / Bug's Life and now it seems with Shrek / Monsters.  While not plagiarism, it is nonetheless eyebrow-raising that the same theme (hero bugs and misunderstood monsters) ends up in both studios.  PDI/SKG's screens are crowded and rich, but can't hold a candle to Pixar animation - and their storytelling falls far short as well.  Originality?  To take a William Steig book and then completely remove any trace of the author's celebrated illustration style is disturbing.  And as for the characters, they all seem, like the ants in Antz, to be made of the same basic animation model, stretched and colored to turn them into the needed creature.  It's the cheap way out, and it shows. Pixar's animation techniques are visually stunning - see this in a theatre - don't wait for video/DVD - the fur on Sully alone is worth the price of admission.  Shrek had its moments - but that was the point - moments - but not a film that hangs together - gags, funny voices (you listen to ""Donkey"" it's because it's funny to hear Eddie Murphy in a home-boy dialect as a donkey, not because of the riveting dialogue).  The acid test?  I'm, far too old to be moved by a kid's movie - and I was, as with even some of Pixar's shorts - near tears near the end.  I wouldn't rent Shrek again - there's really nothing to go back to look at - but as usual, I'll likely go pay to see Monsters again... how can a character with one eye emote  more than most with two?  Bravo Pixar!  Memo to PDI/SKG - you don't go down in history for cutting corners & me-too.  Try again.",

First, they think that human have risky sick so if they touch us they have to clean themselves; they washes themselves and cut their fair. Secondly, they use our fear as the energy; they surprise us to gather our fear. But they are kind if we are accepted as a friends and they protect us, even though they are in danger; SULLY he is a big blue monster protects a child she is a lead character, despite he is in danger of losing his working. In this film, you are always stick to BOO, leading character, because she is so cute and so pretty. When the BOO parts from the monsters, you can't see the scene without crying.

I couldn't believe how realistically the character reflect the persons voice. I'm a VERY BIG John Goodman fan. Although i might not know what he eats in the morning or what cloths he wheres i know hes a VERY good actor. His voice is VERY deep to a big man. He represents a big man and he is. So they placed him in the part of sulley. the big blue monster which does personify him personality. soft loving character. this may seem like a little kids movie but adults can watch this as well. lol the only fact that i don't like about this movie is that they travel through closets through doors. thats kinda cheesy but hey its a child movie.,

425,9 August 2005,asticht-2,8, Brilliant and unexpected,"Monsters Inc. is without a doubt a well conceived movie. The writing was very good and the storyline, contrary to what one professional reviewer from CNN.com said, does NOT drag in the middle. If anyone has seen the early trailer of this movie, it doesn't give justice at all to the movie. John Goodmans portrayal of the big blue monster Sully is warm, and touching. His interaction with the little girl he names Boo is absolutely delightful. There are actually several scenes where some really heartwarming and tear-jerking things happen. This is very surprising considering Disney hasn't really released a tear-jerker since the Lion King in 1994. Unfortunately Billy Crystals character named Mike while very much in character for him is not nearly as visible in the picture as many movie goers would like. Although he is a main character, his humor is very subdued and he is not as sarcastically funny as he is capable of. Even though John Ratzenbergers (Cliff Clavin from Cheers) role is a small one, his character Yeti is very comical and provides a few moments of comic relief during a particularly tense section of the movie.",

Take for instance Mike Wasouski for instance...he gets the worst things happen to him and yet he still manages to smile and make more people laugh about his funny comments! A very good film but there are problems like in any film. some of these are certain flaws and graphic impossibilities. one of which is when the door handles are one side in one picture and in another picture the door handle is the opposite side...:( hmmm good luck with that.

The voices were perfect, with a special mention to Billy Crystal, who gives voice to the funniest character in the whole story (in my opinion), Mike Wazowski. There are good guys and, of course, villains. The monsters are, in fact, no monsters at all; they are incredibly sweet and human. And of course, the script; funny, witty and surprisingly deep. At this point, I guess everybody knows that Disney films always (and I mean always) have an important message, for both kids and adults. Monsters, Inc is a tale about friendship, sticking together through the hard times and not being afraid of the unknown. 90 minutes of cinematic joy that I'd recommend everyone. Grab the popcorn and enjoy.",

The ability to look at the world with a childlike sense of wonder and creativity is a gift. It's a gift the Pixar guys and gals are copiously endowed with. There are more clever, witty ideas in any given five minutes of any Pixar flick than there are in the entire running time of 99% of the crass Hollywood rubbish being foisted on the movie populace. It's a small miracle that these folks are able to do what they do, to say nothing of the technical advances they achieve. To those who say there's no difference between the flicks, please, watch ""Toy Story"" and its sequel.

The animators have given each monster its own personality, and the detail is amazing. How else do you describe the way the writers came up with all the details of the Monsters, Inc. company? This movie is so wonderful because it's not trying to scare kids like so many other monster movies. Although there are a couple of scary moments, this movie is gentle enough for even the youngest children to watch. This movie is by far the best one that the Pixar team has created. The wonderful sound effects, graphics and fun storyline, combined with the cleverly disguised jokes make this a film for the entire family.

I watched this for the first time when I was in my 16-18 year spirt and I laughed non stop. The story is Sulley accidentally lets a little girl into there world. Usually him and all the other monsters who work at monsters inc go through a door that leads them into a childs room once there they scare the kids and the children's screams are put into capsules and brought back and used as energy. So when the girl gets into there world it causes a lot of trouble. This is a great film that you can watch alone or with your entire family.,

What more could you ask for in a movie? Oh, and there's even a romance! They have made a great show for family and kids alike, something that mom and dad can enjoy watching, but that the kids will find fun too. It teaches a lesson... good conquers evil, laughter and love and friendship is more powerful than evil, fear, and nastiness. Good friends stick together and help each other, and also that we shouldn't be scared of things simply because they are unknown to us. I think there is a subtle race/ethnicity lesson here too. The monsters are afraid of the humans... they say they are bad, evil, and can bring death and disaster. The monster leaders have made sure that all monsters know not to touch humans, because they are just BAD. But when one human child gets into the heart of a popular and well known monster, and the monster lives and is not hurt in anyway for caring for and touching and being friends with this human, the rest of the monster world learns a valuable lesson in that humans are bad just because they are human, and that a child's laughter is the most powerful force there is!

Monsters, Inc. has all the usual eye-candy; although the Toy Story films as well as A Bug's Life have made it more difficult to marvel at what's becoming an expected level of perfection, one must only consider Sully's fur, which ripples and sways in the wind (and from his own snoring) with complete realism.  The story is typical Disney, but any hokiness is avoided by the genuine warmth of the attachment between Sully and Boo, the human toddler who has accidentally crossed over into the universe of monsters hidden behind the closet door.  Goodman's characterization matches well with Pixar's visualization, creating a lovable lug, and Boo is simply irresistible, notably her baby-talk.  The only real weak link is Billy Crystal's sidekick Mike.  There seems little reason for the character, frankly.  He just gets to be the cranky, manic pal of the hero, the annoying but good-at-heart fast talker.  It's not that Crystal does a bad job, but the character's a little adrift.  The movie also acts as a kind of allegory about our reliance on power sources that are rooted in others' suffering (eg., oil), but one needn't pay THAT much attention!

503,5 November 2001,animfan,10, AWESOME,"The animation, colors, style, shading - in short EVERYTHING about this film makes it the technically best animated feature film I've seen to date. Shrek looks like an animation school's course project in comparison!  The fur on Sully is absolutely stunning.

504,15 May 2016,gabriellacardinale,10, My entire childhood,"Monsters Inc. was basically my entire childhood. It was made a few months after I was born, so I kind of grew up watching it. It's cute and sweet and I've watched it more times than I can count! Excluding spoilers, it's about a change of heart between two unlikely friends. A monster and a toddler. The monster, Sully, has the job of scaring children. However, Sully develops an attachment to Boo. Boo is the toddler that changes the way he sees human children. The movie is definitely family-friendly. Some people also believe that this movie contributes to the wild ""Pixar Theory"". Overall, it's a cute movie to watch even as an adult.",
505,3 November 2001,bestlerwilcox,10, Amazingly wonderful fairytale,"What a perfect film for these times.  Monsters, Inc. helps us remember the generous joys we have with laughter as the best medicine.  Sully's huge furry body makes way to a monster who is loving, caring and warm - there are many surprises in store for him during the story line.  Mike (M.I.K.E. with one ""I"") has cute little quips that has everyone giggling throughout the film.  ""Boo"" brings us GREAT joy - with her giggles, charm, cute little games, and adorable smile.  The ""voiceovers"" are a perfect match for every character.  Pixar's animation brings a whole new world to the medium of creativity and commitment.  You will never look at another closet door the same - I guarantee if you have a child (or maybe even you) - there will be a searching in every closet - to see if we can get to the fun little world of Monstropolis - I wanna see ""kitty""!",
506,6 January 2002,bilkyboy,9, A clever and a gut wrenching comedy,"Monsters Inc. is one of the freshest comedy in a long while.  Its not one of those gross out comedies that are plaguing the market today.  It is just.fun.  A good movie that the whole family can enjoy.  The Computer Graphics in this film are jaw dropping, especially on Sulley's fur.  Plus we get to here that distinctive voice of John `Cliff' Ratzenberger as the Yeti in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. An all round great movie with perfect casting and a awesome story line with plenty laughs provided for kids of ages 4 to 78 and higher. The only gripe with this movie is the character of Randall Boggs played by Steve Buscemi, more could have been done with his character, but this is being real picky. Great Laughs. Remember to stay for the bloopers.",
507,13 November 2001,tenchi muyo,6, It was o.k.,"Billy Crystal and John Goodman did a good job, bringing the characters to life.  But, lets face it, this movie didn't come close to the humor offered by ""Toy Story"" or ""Shrek"".  It seemed to me that the characters where reaching for jokes a lot. The plot was not very exciting.  Actually, it was very predictable, you could sit through the first 20 minutes and predict what will happen at the end.  However, for kids seven and under this movie is great.  But, if you are over seven you can try your luck and see how you like it!",

Anyway, Pixar's old animations were much better, they represented friendship and family, the current ones are a bit spoiled, but the old ones were very good, like this, in short, it was very good..",

There is adult humor  (as in intelligent, not  as in gross or obscene) that tickles the adult funny bone as well as entertaining children of all ages.  I was delighted to see that the second viewing was just as fun if not more.  I caught little subtle funnies that I missed the first time and laughed just as much at those I remembered.  The current release includes out-takes with the ""cast""  which are hilarious.  My only caution is that some of the scare scenes could be a little scary for the young ones but they don't last long and seem to be soon forgotten by the gentleness shown by some of the monsters.  I predict it will live long in the video market too!",

A city of monsters with their very own way of generating electricity - through terrifying human children! The classic door scheme, where they walk through and end up in a child's closet; it's like nightmare on elm street with humour and lovable characters! Originally, the monsters are scared of the children because they think they are contaminated, therefore, they have a whole security system ensuring nothing of the human world enters the monster world - the CPA! (child protection agency). However, Mike and Sullivan end up in a spot of bother when they end up with a curious and naive little child - Boo!

A closet door, which by day leads to a closet, at night leads directly to Monstropolis, the world of monsters, which is powered by Scream Heat.

519,3 May 2006,wandellaty,8, Great Movie,"Keeping in line with the other Pixar feels that came before it, Monsters Inc, is an enjoyable film for the ages. I especially liked the script. I felt the writers did a good job keeping the humor clean but giving it enough of an inside joke for older viewers to appreciate. I liked the way they ended the movie too, they left things open for a future movie. I have probably watched this one over 35 times. What about Mike's car, do you think he would get another one. I would have liked to see what kind of car they would have designed for Sully. The old lady #1 was a good role it was very believable. The only part I didn't like all that much was the part when they were chasing around in the assembly line of doors and the crushing etc. That scene went a little long, but overall it was a great movie.",

However, this story is much better in some ways - it's a tightly told tale that moves well.  In fact it's a wonderfully told story which it has heads and tails over all three of those movies.  Were it not for the gags, and other good laughs in the prior three I'd say Monsters was better.",

The witfull animations put together with some of the best voices in the business. John Goodman as a purple-haired monster and Billy Crystal as a one-eyed phlegm-looking ditto is something that will make you laugh until you drop and make you ask for more. But animation isn't the only issue here (although it's hard to overlook). There is also a very compelling story behind it all. And a very different, but nonetheless original take on why there are monsters in childrens closets...(and there are, you know). What would any monster with a logical sense be doing in a childs closet if it weren't to ""harvest"" their screams for energy-production to support the hard working inhabitants of Monstropolis. Original and witty. Go see it! If not for yourself...then do it to reassure your child that there is nothing in the closet and no monsters with pointy claws under their bed. Because monsters don't exist...right?! :-)",

The character of Sully, played by John Goodman, is a furry blue and purple monster.  Each hair on is body was so well done I felt like I could reach and and touch the soft fur.  The ensemble cast was incredible. Billy Crystal is fantastic as Mike and the adorable little Boo actually played by a 3 year old child is the best part of the film.

My 14 month old daughter could not take her eyes off of the film (it may have been what she recognized as a giant t.v. screen) and even my wife, who generally does not get entertained by animated movies, loved it.

I kept looking at the tiny details like the body hair on Sully and the Abominable Snowman characters. Just amazing! And to top it off, Pixar included their animated short ""Birds of a Feather"" which nearly had me rolling on the floor with laughter.

(M.I.) is the largest scream-processing factory in Monstropolis. The company generates energy from screams of human children. The top Scarer is James P. Sullivan, AKA Sulley, a huge monster with blue fur and purple spots on his body. His assistant - also his best friend and roommate - Mike Wazowski is a green, little one-eyed monster. Since the children are considered toxic and poisonous, it is absolutely forbidden for anything from the human world to cross into the monster world - even a stray sock alerts a task force. But one night after work, Sulley accidentally lets in a human girl. Named Boo, she is a threat for the monster race. But soon Mike and Sulley find out that she is actually very loyal and harmless to the monsters. She was supposed to be used for the experiment scream-mining machine of the most evil monster in Monstropolis, Randall. Later Mike and Sulley find out that Randall is completing the mission of Mr.Waternoose, the owner of Monsters Inc. Now Sulley and Mike are in a difficult situation because Mr. Waternoose and Randall want to kill Boo to eliminate any evidence of what happened. The Children Control Agency wants to eliminate the girl because of their confidence in the danger kids bring. But Mike and Sulley become friends with Boo so they don't want to give her to anybody. On the way to save Boo the monsters find many difficulties. After being caught Mike and Sulley are sent to the human world, from where they successfully escape. But finding Boo is not the most difficult thing for them, they must find Boo's closet's door, because the whole scaring system is based on closet doors. M.I. has millions of doors, and Mike and Sully must find the right one.",

Don't get me wrong; this is a fine family film, with good quality CGI, a solid, well-told story, and all the rest.  Go see it.  Your kids, 'specially those about 7 to 12, will go googly over it, and you'll have a fine time, too. But like some reviewers, I found this didn't seem to have the warmth and 'humanity' of Toy Story I and II, nor does it have the sass and splash of Shrek.  To me, its one of those efforts that is fine for what it is, I just happen to like more spunk, I guess. But by all means, take it in, especially if you have kids.

Monsters, Inc. is a very moving story about Sacrifice and the power of love.n my opinion, the best animation movie ever made. Graphics may look ""old"" nowadays, but this is not the point. The story is based on a VERY clever concept, and the final result is very sweet. Monsters gain their energy consuming the cries of frightened children, and have developed methods and technology to ""steal"" it. The best ""frightener"" of the monsters has to deal with a... baby girl, that by accident enters the monsters' land, and ends up to treat her with love and care, and protects her from being seen, as babies are considered... health danger!

561,4 November 2001,cpcii,10, Outstanding Movie,"As usual Pixar and Disney put together a great story and animation,  Where ever did they come up with this story line.  Great for children of all ages. Looking forward for a DVD Release.  Only thing bad I could  even think of was.  No OUTTAKES??? No funnies???",
562,3 November 2001,fredmolinski,10, Ten times better than Shrek!!!,"I loved this movie, as did my kids and my wife.  It was very funny, very exciting, and surprisingly moving.  I admit it--I cried.  I also felt riveted to my seat.  John Goodman and Billy Crystal were perfect.  The ""door machine chase"" at the end was unforgettable.  I've been a little let down by Pixar--LOVED Toy Story, liked Bug's Life, liked Toy Story 2--but this one brought the magic completely back.  And made me realize just how overrated Shrek was.  I laughed at this movie more, it was completely emotionally satisfying, taught a great message, and the story never stopped moving (unlike Shrek, which didn't really seem to have anyplace to go).  Give this one the Oscar!",

565,29 April 2006,apoboul2,9, excellent!!,"In my opinion, the best animation movie ever made. Graphics may look ""old"" nowadays, but this is not the point. The story is based on a VERY clever concept, and the final result is very sweet. Monsters gain their energy consuming the cries of frightened children, and have developed methods and technology to ""steal"" it. The best ""frightener"" of the monsters has to deal with a... baby girl, that by accident enters the monsters' land, and ends up to treat her with love and care, and protects her from being seen, as babies are considered... health danger! Although the movie is full of clever humor, this is not its strong point against others like ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Shrek 2"": It's the story, the sweetness and the relation between the baby and the good monster that makes it an excellent film, not only for children! Highlight: The ""making of"" of the film, in which the ""actors"" make fun of each other, miss their words etc, as if they were real humans!",
566,19 November 2001,phudgins,9," Perfect casting, excellent plotline.","I have rarely had a movie that entertained my wife, my four year old daughter and I to the same level.  The humor was directed equally to children and adults, and the adult humor (and drama) was subtle enough to pass by a child without phasing him or her.  The plotline was both simple and complex, almost Lucas-like in this duality. Kids would enjoy the simple lower-level plotline without having to understand the more detailed, suggestive plot that is diverse enough to entertain their parents.  My family enjoyed this movie.  My daughter asked to see it a second time when it was over and I honestly considered it. The casting was done with perfect decision, even down to the smallest cameo (John Ratzenberger) as the Abominable Snowman, which looked strangely identical to the same one from the old Rudolph Christmas special..",
567,20 May 2015,dilos-26128,1, Would 've been great minus the annoying child,"Would 've been great minus the annoying child. Monster inc starts great. The whole concept of monsters being scared of little children is funny in an ironic kid of way. The depiction of the monsters world is enjoyable although it is filled with clichés that dominate most movies. The movie is an easy 8 up to the point it introduces the annoying child that runs into trouble all the time, but miraculously escapes danger every time although the whole city of monsters inc is looking for it. You have the best of the monsters inc monster failing to get rid of a child who is 1/10th of its size. Then sulley grows fond of it and protects it although its supposed to be toxic and she is moaning, crying and being annoying in every way imaginable. Is it cute when a child misbehaves cries and moans all the time? I guess for the screenwriters of monsters inc it is, proving beyond any doubt that they are useless and incapable of coming up with a sweet character for a child. Those are the qualities people dislike in children. I guess if you are 5 years old you are going to enjoy the movie. Personally I couldn't stand it and stopped watching after 1 hour. Waste of my time.",

Our family of five (kids ages: 12,11,9) enjoyed it very much. From the previews I didn't expect very much, but the movie was one that didn't have any dull moments and kept you wondering what was going to happen next. John Goodman and Billy Crystal were great as Sulley and Mike and the little girl was adorable (don't know whose voice it is). I would recommend this movie to anyone especially to those that have children. The only parts of it that you can call ""scary"" are not really all that frightening. The monsters in the movie are more cute & funny than they are scary. Go see it!",

Not even a picture this time. Although she is too. Probably, a couple of words about graphics first of all. If it is appropriate to use such terms, the restyled version of the cartoon looks modern thanks to 3D and, for sure, some other tricks. But in the case of Pixar, it's probably not that that's valuable, but the mental attitude and impressions that come out in the end. I can say about myself that they were stronger, in my opinion, than in the first viewing. Firstly, because there is an incredible fantasy on the topic of children's fears, and secondly, the level of responsibility of these children's fears, in the sense of monsters.",
595,17 December 2013,EllieGooding,8, hi,I thought monsters inc was an amazing film i watched when i was a kid. They got the right actors to be in this film. I believe the actors in this film got along. Boo is my favorite character. I hope they do more films like monsters inc because they are really good. Randel was so nice in monsters university then he turned on mike that was so mean. I couldn't believe Ross was in Monsters university Monsters inc was way better then monsters university The animation in both of the films were so different I recommend you should watch it And make your own review I love watching movies so you should watch both of those films because they are good.

598,11 February 2023,unstableteenager,10, My Favorite Animated Movie,"Great plot, characters, humor, and some emotional parts. The plot is kinda funny because they took the idea of monsters in children's closets and turned it into a 90 minute movie. It has some of the greatest characters in any animated movie, or any movie in general. But those characters are Mike, Sulley, Boo, and Randall. And we can't forget about another outstanding performance from John Ratzenberger, as the Abominable Snowman. Mike, Boo, and Roz(who I can do the voice of nearly perfect) are hilarious, especially Mike. The end won't make you cry, but is sad on the first watch because you haven't seen the ending.",

What begins as a hilarious and mind-bending take on the hidden world lurking in the closets of our childhood nightmares, becomes a heart-pounding adventure for the welfare of a little girl that is punctuated perfectly with comedic flourishes and sentiment that will jerk a tear or two from the corner of your eyes.  And I thought Shrek was the end all with its rich characters and classic in-jokes--but this animated delight is the reason why Character and not Plot should dominate a film.  Rent it now.

Helps teach kids not to be afraid, without being too over the top. Not scary at all. Pixar may not be able to top Toy Story, but this movie is another excellent example of what they do best; sweet, relate able, family films that transcend age groups and reach out to everyone.",

The computer animation works beautifully, but where the movie really shines is the story. Who would have thought that the monsters are afraid of little boys and girls, but they have to hide in closets and scare little kids at night because their screams power the electric utility company of Monsterville. With the help of a little child that is not at all afraid of monsters, our two heroes uncover a conspiracy of grandest proportions, but that's all I will tell you here. After all, you should go out and rent the movie for yourself. Personally, I like Monsters Inc. better than Nemo, it's in a close tie with Shreck, and only second to Spirited Away in the animated category.",

As a child, I was entertained by the funny ""kitty,"" his partner-in-crime, and their surprising pal. Now, I watch this film and am still entertained. However, I now realize the impressiveness and complexity seen in Monsters, Inc. The competitive world that I have since entered from the first time I watched this movie is practically displayed in the monster world. Along with the competitive spirits of Randall and Sully, is Sully's attachment to an unlikely friend, and the difficulty of letting go. Sully must say goodbye to Boo, as she reenters the human world. This scene is so relatable, that for an instant, we forget the differences between the monster world and the real world. Monsters, Inc. provokes many emotions, and ultimately allows for people of all ages to have a pleasurable experience they won't soon forget.",

615,22 July 2015,TonioHaze,9, Underestimated piece of contemporary philosophy,"Behind the highly overrated clean animation characters with big eyes and clumsy looks that those big babol chewing Disney CEOs keep promoting, lies silent a very stimulating concept: that logically when there's something unknown to ""face"", we get way more energy from trying to making it better, than from avoiding it following the instincts that are pushed by our own fear. The wisdom of the screenplay is right in front of the viewer, but hidden by the colored masks of the funny and clumsy monster drawings. This movie helps people being less afraid of whatever they're afraid of, and - for how ordinary it might seem - this is one of the greatest purposes one artist can decide to chase. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did, that is with inspiration.",

617,26 December 2021,Mohamed_Reda_El-Naggar,10, I hope that cartoon films like this wonderful work will be created,"This was a wonderful movie, with colourful characters, a fun storyline, and a funny and sometimes touching script.(I liked Shrek as well, but I slightly preferred this) I don't think it is quite as good as Toy Story, but I found it an enormously entertaining film, it was much better than I expected. The animation was truly excellent, with colourful and engaging backgrounds, and no stiff movements as far as I could see. I wasn't hugely keen on the song playing over the end credits, but compared to the overall goodness of the film, that is such a minor criticism, and it is fair to say that people have different tastes in music. The script was very, very funny, particularly with the character Roz. The voice talents were fantastic, John Goodman and Billy Crystal were brilliant as Sulley and Mike, Steve Buschemi clearly has a lot of seedy fun as Randall, Jennifer Tilly is wonderfully innocent as Mike's girlfriend, and the late James Coburn is wholly convincing as Waternoose. And I loved the character of Boo, she was so cute, and I loved the ending, people complained it was overly-sentimental but I thought it was so sweet. The story, as is always the case with Pixar films is highly original and charming, and doesn't drag at all. Overall, a wonderful film, truly entertaining and a must-see, and if you are starting to lose faith in Disney and their countless sequels, this is perfect for you.",

623,1 May 2018,venus-43937,10, A Movie With A Bigger Picture.,"In this loving, yet fun kid's movie, the main characters change their world through friendship, justice, and sacrifice. One of the main characters is Sullivan. Sullivan is a big, tall, furry, blue and green monster that has a loving heart for a different creator than himself. His best friend, Mike, is a short, round, all green, one-eyed fellow who only cares about himself and not the world around him. Mike drives a sports car and inspires to climb the corporate ladder. Sullivan, also referred to as Sully, walks to work, and genuinely cares about the environment and the creators being harmed by the creation of their energy supply. Mike and Sully work for Monsters, Incorporated, who power the world of Monstropolis with the screams of human children. When a child named Boo enters the monster world, a panic is created. Human children are poisonous to monsters, or so they think. A series of events happen that lead the monsters to capturing the child and realizing her laughs supply more energy than her screams. At the end of the movie, Sully and Mike take over the Monsters, Inc. and use the newly found energy source (laughs) as their only energy source. The children are no longer scared of monsters in their closet but get a laugh when monsters enter into the human world. 
A friendship like Woody and Buzz from Toy Story, Mater and Lightning McQueen from Cars, or even Remy and Linguini from Ratatouille, all show that true friends can overcome obstacles in life. It also shows that one outgoing friend and one conservative friend can join forces and change the world they live in for the better. 
Even above friendship, justice, and sacrifice, I think the overall picture is saying we need a better energy source that doesn't harm the environment. It's a long shot, but it makes sense to relate their story to ours. They go against the grain to fight for better energy sources that give them more energy in the long run.",
